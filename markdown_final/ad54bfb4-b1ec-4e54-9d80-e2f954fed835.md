## Question

What is the relationship between inflammatory bowel disease and allergic rhinitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the relationship between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and allergic rhinitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiologic association and its magnitude. Then, I should verify whether there is shared genetic architecture. Next, I will consider environmental contributors and temporality. After that, I will examine plausible mechanisms and reconcile any apparent contradictions. I should then review clinical guideline implications and avoid conflating IBD with IBS. Finally, I will synthesize strength-of-evidence and provide a bottom-line clinical take-home, ensuring self-checks at each step to avoid over-interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the core epidemiologic signal. The large, population-based Swedish "genetically informed" study shows a modest but consistent within-individual association between IBD and allergic rhinitis, with an adjusted odds ratio of about 1.27 (95% CI, 1.20–1.34), and similar estimates for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease; prevalence context in that cohort was roughly 31% for allergic rhinitis and 0.7% for IBD, so this comorbidity is real but small in absolute terms and unlikely to drive routine cross-screening by itself [^111UKrzZ] [^115KDPsE].

> Wait, let me verify whether other cohorts exaggerate this effect and why. The Manitoba retrospective administrative study reports stronger associations and bidirectionality using prescription proxies (RR for IBD after allergic rhinitis 2.10; 95% CI, 1.97–2.24; HR for allergic rhinitis after IBD 2.62), but given its design and phenotype definition, detection bias and misclassification are plausible; I need to interpret these larger estimates cautiously relative to the Swedish registry-based diagnostic approach [^115DhZT7].

> I need to check the genetic architecture next. The Swedish study's twin modeling and molecular analyses found minimal to no shared genetic liability between IBD and allergic rhinitis: genetic correlation around 0.06 with CIs crossing zero, and null PRS/LDSC cross-trait signals, despite clear within-trait heritability for each disease, which argues against meaningful pleiotropy driving the comorbidity signal [^111Wm9Kc].

> Hold on, I should verify the heritability parameters to avoid over-claiming. Univariate modeling in the twin subcohorts supported strong heritability for IBD and moderate heritability for allergic rhinitis, yet cross-trait genetic correlations remained weak or null, and familial co-aggregation decreased stepwise with genetic distance, together pointing more toward shared familial confounding or unique environmental exposure rather than substantial shared genetics between IBD and allergic rhinitis [^111Wm9Kc].

> Next, I should review the environmental hypotheses that could plausibly explain a modest association absent shared heritability. The epithelial barrier hypothesis posits that modern environmental exposures perturb mucosal barriers across organs, including gut and nasal mucosa, potentially enabling a shared vulnerability phenotype; similarly, multi-omic work implicates early-life air toxics, nasal methylation, and gene expression changes predisposing to allergic rhinitis, and broader gut microbiome–immune interactions may modulate atopic risk, though direct causal links specific to IBD–allergic rhinitis remain inferential rather than proven [^1162pWDu] [^112ybTj7] [^116C9LFW].

> Now, temporality and directionality: I should double-check claims before drawing causal arrows. The Swedish analysis demonstrates bidirectional association within individuals but does not establish causality; earlier I thought it showed hazard ratios for subsequent allergic rhinitis, but wait, that's not correct — the stronger time-to-event signals come from the Manitoba administrative study, which, again, may be inflated by surveillance and coding artifacts, so temporality remains suggestive but inconclusive [^111Wm9Kc] [^115DhZT7].

> But wait, what if immune pathway overlap exists even when genome-wide genetic correlations are null? The FinnGen meta-analysis of upper respiratory diseases identifies 41 loci and implicates type 2 inflammation pathways, with phenome-wide associations that include autoimmune conditions such as IBD at pharyngeal disease loci; this suggests convergence at pathway or tissue-compartment levels rather than robust shared disease genetics, which helps reconcile mechanistic plausibility with the Swedish study's null cross-trait genetics [^114MEqPy].

> I should confirm how this translates into clinical practice. Major allergic rhinitis guidelines (AAAAI/ACAAI Rhinitis 2020, ARIA 2016) focus on the well-established rhinitis–asthma axis and provide treatment recommendations (intranasal corticosteroids as preferred monotherapy in persistent disease, intranasal antihistamines as first-line for intermittent disease, and immunotherapy via shared decision-making), but they do not recommend screening for IBD in patients with allergic rhinitis, which aligns with the modest, non-causal epidemiology and minimal genetic overlap seen in the Swedish study [^112h6zaD] [^113DUE8H] [^116D8aTd] [^111rAJqm] [^111Wm9Kc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions and conflate IBD with IBS. Atopy appears more strongly linked to irritable bowel syndrome in several studies, likely via functional gut–brain–immune mechanisms, whereas IBD is an organic inflammatory disease; best practice is to avoid over-attributing rhinitis–gut symptoms to IBD and to use guideline-based reassessment for refractory IBS when appropriate, keeping the entities distinct in counseling and workup [^113MgNPi] [^115tNM4m].

> Let me consider therapeutic overlaps that could confuse interpretation. Systemic corticosteroids are labeled for severe allergic conditions including allergic rhinitis and for IBD flares, but their shared use should not be mistaken for shared disease biology; the treatment intersection reflects broad anti-inflammatory effects rather than common etiology, and guideline-based local therapy remains first-line for allergic rhinitis with systemic steroids reserved for short, severe episodes [^113DgfEZ] [^115rFawr] [^116uvpvz].

> I will now examine related ENT comorbidity data briefly. Some cross-sectional data suggest that chronic rhinosinusitis may be slightly more prevalent or skewed toward the nasal polyp phenotype in IBD compared with background rates, but effect sizes are small, design limitations abound, and this does not currently alter screening or management algorithms for either condition [^112Mmro2].

> Let me synthesize the strength of evidence, and I should verify that my conclusions stay within data bounds. There is a reproducible, modest epidemiologic comorbidity between IBD and allergic rhinitis; cross-trait genetic sharing appears minimal to none; familial patterns and twin modeling point away from substantial pleiotropy and toward unique environmental contributors; mechanistic hypotheses such as epithelial barrier dysfunction and type 2 pathway convergence are plausible but not yet directly causal for this dyad; and current guidelines reasonably do not endorse routine cross-screening or altered management based on this association alone [^111Wm9Kc] [^114MEqPy] [^112h6zaD].

> Bottom line, and I should double-check that I am not overstating clinical actionability: IBD and allergic rhinitis are epidemiologically related but etiologically distinct, with likely contributions from shared environmental exposures and broad immune pathways rather than shared disease genes; clinicians should treat and monitor each condition per guideline standards, remain alert to symptom clusters that warrant usual care escalation, and avoid routine cross-screening for IBD in allergic rhinitis absent specific GI red flags or vice versa [^111Wm9Kc] [^112h6zaD].

IBD and allergic rhinitis are linked by **shared immune dysregulation** [^117GY7HY] and **barrier dysfunction** [^1162pWDu], with modest epidemiologic co-occurrence and minimal genetic overlap [^111Wm9Kc]. Both feature Th2/Th17 skewing, eosinophilia, and impaired epithelial barriers, and are further connected through gut–airway cross-talk and microbiome alterations [^notfound] [^1162pWDu] [^114WGA4u] [^116C9LFW]. Epidemiologically, AR increases IBD risk (RR 2.10) [^115DhZT7] and IBD increases AR risk (HR 2.62), yet the **genetic correlation is weak** (r ≈ 0.06) [^111UKrzZ]. Clinically, **co-occurrence can worsen symptoms** and quality of life; management should address both conditions and shared environmental triggers.

---

## Epidemiological associations

- **Increased risk of IBD in AR patients**: A large cohort showed AR precedes IBD with RR 2.10 (95% CI 1.97–2.24) [^115DhZT7].

- **Increased risk of AR in IBD patients**: IBD patients have higher subsequent AR incidence (HR 2.62, 95% CI 2.45–2.80) [^115DhZT7] [^115KDPsE].

- **Bidirectional association**: The relationship is bidirectional, with each condition increasing risk of the other [^115DhZT7] [^115SX9HK].

---

## Shared immunological mechanisms

- **Th2 and Th17 immune responses**: Both show Th2/Th17 skewing, with eosinophilia and cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-17) driving inflammation [^117GY7HY] [^111w4tMw].

- **Eosinophilic inflammation**: Eosinophil infiltration is common to both, contributing to tissue damage and symptoms.

- **Cytokine overlap**: Shared cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-17) underpin inflammation in both diseases [^117GY7HY].

---

## Genetic predisposition

Genetically, there is **minimal genetic correlation**: twin and molecular analyses show r ≈ 0.06 between IBD and AR [^111UKrzZ] [^111Wm9Kc]. Distinct **genetic architectures** are likely, as modest familial co-aggregation occurs despite limited genetic overlap [^115KDPsE].

---

## Environmental factors

- **Microbiome dysbiosis**: Gut dysbiosis is implicated in both, altering immune responses and barrier integrity [^116C9LFW].

- **Antibiotic exposure**: Early antibiotics increase AR risk, likely via microbiome disruption [^11427eyq].

- **Diet and lifestyle**: Western diet, urbanization, and pollution contribute to both via barrier damage and immune activation [^1162pWDu] [^112ybTj7].

---

## Barrier dysfunction

Both conditions feature **epithelial barrier impairment**, which increases antigen penetration and inflammation [^1162pWDu] [^117GY7HY]. The **gut–airway axis** further links them: dysfunction in one mucosa can drive inflammation at distant sites via systemic immune signaling [^114WGA4u] [^115EPDYG].

---

## Clinical implications

Clinically, **symptom overlap** can worsen symptoms, reduce quality of life, and complicate management. Treatment considerations include addressing both conditions and **shared triggers**; intranasal corticosteroids [^116D8aTd] and leukotriene antagonists [^116audpU] may help AR, while IBD therapy should consider AR comorbidity.

---

## Summary of connections

| **Connection type** | **Evidence** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|-|
| Epidemiological | Strong | Bidirectional association |
| Immunological | Moderate | - Th2/Th17 skewing <br/> - Eosinophilia <br/> - Cytokines |
| Genetic | Weak | Minimal genetic correlation |
| Environmental | Moderate | - Microbiome dysbiosis <br/> - Antibiotics <br/> - Diet |
| Barrier dysfunction | Strong | - Epithelial barrier impairment <br/> - Gut–airway axis |

---

IBD and allergic rhinitis are connected through **shared immune dysregulation** and **barrier dysfunction**, with modest epidemiologic co-occurrence and minimal genetic overlap. Co-occurrence can worsen symptoms and quality of life; management should address both conditions and shared environmental triggers.

### Comorbidity between inflammatory bowel disease and asthma and allergic diseases: A genetically informed study [^111UKrzZ]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Little is known about the shared origins between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and allergic diseases, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and eczema. This study aimed to expand knowledge on the etiological sources of comorbidities between these disorders using a range of genetically informed methods.

Methods used include within-individual and familial co-aggregation analysis applied to 2,873,445 individuals born in Sweden from 1987 to 2014, and their first- and second-degree relatives. Quantitative genetic modeling was conducted on 38,723 twin pairs to decompose genetic and environmental sources for comorbidity. Polygenic risk score analysis between IBD and allergic diseases was performed on 48,186 genotyped twins, and linkage disequilibrium score regression was applied using publicly available data to explore genetic overlap.

IBD was associated with asthma (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.30 to 1.40), allergic rhinitis (aOR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.34), and eczema (aOR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.38 to 1.56), with similar estimates for ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. The odds ratios for familial co-aggregation decreased with decreasing genetic relatedness. Quantitative genetic modeling revealed little evidence of common genetic factors between IBD and allergic diseases. For example, the genetic correlation between IBD and allergic rhinitis was rₐ = 0.06 (95% CI, −0.03 to 0.15), but there was some evidence of unique environmental factors between IBD and eczema (rₑ = 0.16; 95% CI, 0.00 to 0.32). Molecular genetic analyses were similarly null for IBD and allergic diseases.

### Does the epithelial barrier hypothesis explain the increase in allergy, autoimmunity and other chronic conditions [^1162pWDu]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2021). Low credibility.

There has been a steep increase in allergic and autoimmune diseases, reaching epidemic proportions and now affecting more than one billion people worldwide. These diseases are more common in industrialized countries, and their prevalence continues to rise in developing countries in parallel with urbanization and industrialization. Intact skin and mucosal barriers are crucial for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis as they protect host tissues from infections, environmental toxins, pollutants, and allergens. A defective epithelial barrier has been demonstrated in allergic and autoimmune conditions such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, eosinophilic esophagitis, coeliac disease, and inflammatory bowel disease.

In addition, leakiness of the gut epithelium is also implicated in systemic autoimmune and metabolic conditions such as diabetes, obesity, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis, and autoimmune hepatitis. Finally, distant inflammatory responses due to a 'leaky gut' and microbiome changes are suspected in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, chronic depression, and autism spectrum disorders.

This article introduces an extended 'epithelial barrier hypothesis', which proposes that the increase in epithelial barrier-damaging agents linked to industrialization, urbanization, and modern life underlies the rise in allergic, autoimmune, and other chronic conditions. Furthermore, it discusses how the immune responses to dysbiotic microbiota that cross the damaged barrier may be involved in these conditions.

### Aeroallergen-related diseases predate the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease [^115DhZT7]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

This study aimed to determine whether having a diagnosis of asthma or allergic rhinitis (AR) increased the risk of being diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and whether there was increased incidence of these diseases following a diagnosis of IBD.

- **Design**: This is a retrospective, historical cohort-based study. We used the administrative data of Manitoba Health and the population-based University of Manitoba IBD Epidemiology Database. We used numbers of prescriptions for drugs used to treat asthma and AR to identify diagnoses of asthma and AR, respectively. We calculated relative risks (RRs) to assess the incidence of IBD compared with matched controls after diagnoses of asthma and AR, and hazard ratios to determine the incidence of asthma and AR after IBD diagnosis.

- **Results**: Compared with controls, a diagnosis of asthma or AR preceding a diagnosis of IBD was increased in cases (RR, 1.62; 95% confidence interval, 1.50–1.75; and RR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.97–2.24) with a similar outcome by subtype of IBD (Crohn's disease vs ulcerative colitis) and by sex. On sensitivity analysis, diagnoses of asthma or AR were comparable when considering at least 5, 10, 15, or 20 drug prescriptions. Persons with IBD were more likely to develop asthma or AR than controls after being diagnosed with IBD (hazard ratio for asthma, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.18–1.45; and hazard ratio for AR, 2.62; 95% CI, 2.45–2.80).

- **Conclusions**: The association between asthma, AR, and IBD suggests the possibility that whatever triggers the onset of these atopic diseases may trigger the onset of IBD as well.

### Role of airway epithelial cells in development of asthma and allergic rhinitis [^112aDQa4]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Asthma and allergic rhinitis frequently coexist in the same patient. There is a similarity and variation, as well as a potential relationship, between asthma and allergic rhinitis. Increasing evidence suggests a major involvement of airway epithelial cells in the pathogenesis of these conditions. This review describes the importance of airway epithelial cells in the development of allergic airway diseases, emphasizing their role as the primary airway defense against exposure to inflammatory stimuli and antigens. Epithelial cells are crucial through the activation of epithelial Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to provide an important link between innate immunity and allergic disease.

Additionally, airway epithelial cells can act as inflammatory promoters, capable of directing dendritic cells (DCs) towards a T helper 2 (Th2) response, and as active producers of several inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators. It is hypothesized that airway epithelial cells may play roles as both inflammatory initiators and in immuno-pathological feedback regulation between allergic rhinitis and asthma, via the release of systemic inflammatory mediators. Therefore, airway epithelial cells may serve as valuable therapeutic targets for the discovery and development of new drugs or therapeutic strategies to treat asthma and allergic rhinitis.

### Multi-omic integration reveals alterations in nasal mucosal biology that mediate air pollutant effects on allergic rhinitis [^112ybTj7]. Allergy (2024). Low credibility.

Allergic rhinitis is a common inflammatory condition of the nasal mucosa that imposes a considerable health burden. Air pollution has been observed to increase the risk of developing allergic rhinitis. We addressed the hypotheses that early life exposure to air toxics is associated with developing allergic rhinitis, and that these effects are mediated by DNA methylation and gene expression in the nasal mucosa.

- **Methods**: In a case-control cohort of 505 participants, we geocoded participants' early life exposure to air toxics using data from the US Environmental Protection Agency; assessed physician diagnosis of allergic rhinitis by questionnaire; and collected nasal brushings for whole-genome DNA methylation and transcriptome profiling. We then performed a series of analyses, including differential expression, Mendelian randomization, and causal mediation analyses to characterize relationships between early life air toxics, nasal DNA methylation, nasal gene expression, and allergic rhinitis.

- **Results**: Among the 505 participants, 275 had allergic rhinitis. The mean age of the participants was 16.4 years (standard deviation = 9.5 years). Early life exposure to air toxics such as acrylic acid, phosphine, antimony compounds, and benzyl chloride was associated with developing allergic rhinitis. These air toxics exerted their effects by altering the nasal DNA methylation and nasal gene expression levels of genes involved in respiratory ciliary function, mast cell activation, pro-inflammatory TGF-β1 signaling, and the regulation of myeloid immune cell function.

### Allergy-related diseases in childhood and risk for abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders at 16 years — a birth cohort study [^115NZihD]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The burden of allergy-related diseases in childhood does not significantly affect the relative risk (RR) for any abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorder (AP-FGID) at 16 years. However, the RR for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) at 16 years increases with a greater number of allergy-related diseases, although this linear trend is only borderline statistically significant.

- **Association between allergy burden and gastrointestinal disorders**: The study uses the presence of allergy-related diseases such as asthma, rhinitis, eczema, and food hypersensitivity as a proxy for allergy burden at 16 years. The associations were assessed through a binomial generalized linear model with a log link function, adjusted for sex. Children with no AP-FGID at age 16 were used as the reference group in these analyses. Definitions used include AP-FGID for abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders, CI for confidence interval, IBS for irritable bowel syndrome, and RR for relative risk.

### Expression of cysteinyl leukotriene synthetic and signalling proteins in inflammatory cells in active seasonal allergic rhinitis [^113b9xEW]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2003). Low credibility.

Cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) are bioactive lipids that have been shown to contribute to allergic and inflammatory diseases. Eosinophils and mast cells have the capacity to produce large amounts of CysLTs after allergic or non-allergic stimulation. Molecular identification of both the synthetic and signalling proteins in the CysLT pathway allows the investigation of expression of the CysLT enzymes and receptors in active allergic rhinitis.

- **Objective**: We examined the expression of the proteins involved in the synthesis of CysLTs and the cysteinyl leukotriene-1 (CysLT1) and cysteinyl leukotriene-2 (CysLT2) receptors in inflammatory cells from patients with active seasonal allergic rhinitis.

- **Methods**: Nasal lavage samples were obtained from patients during active seasonal allergic rhinitis. Specific cellular immunocytochemical techniques were used to detect the cysteinyl leukotriene synthetic proteins, namely 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP), and leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S). In situ hybridization and immunocytochemical techniques were used to identify the mRNA and proteins for the CysLT1 and CysLT2 receptors.

- **Results**: 5-LO, FLAP, LTC4S, and the CysLT1 and CysLT2 receptors were expressed in the majority of eosinophils and in subsets of mast cells and mononuclear cells. 5-LO, FLAP, and the CysLT1 receptor, but not LTC4S or the CysLT2 receptor, were expressed in a subset of nasal neutrophils.

- **Conclusions**: Our study demonstrates the presence of CysLT pathway proteins in key allergic and inflammatory cells from the upper airway.

### Airway inflammatory profile among cleaning workers from different workplaces [^114hSDE1]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

It is known that nasal and ocular symptoms are more significant in the presence of high molecular weight agents than in the presence of lower molecular weight agents. Among cleaning workers, the use of low molecular weight products is more common, and many of these products are irritants.

Rhinitis of allergic origin may or may not induce the onset of asthma in people who have never had pulmonary diseases, as demonstrated in the study by Bauchau and Durham, which showed that allergic rhinitis was more prevalent among cleaning professionals than in the general population. These data corroborate our findings, which demonstrated that individuals from the three groups of cleaning workers had more respiratory symptoms than office workers.

The data found in our study on rhinitis demonstrated that both the presence of rhinitis-defining symptoms and self-reported rhinitis were greater among cleaners than among office workers. However, there was no relationship between these variables and the percentage of eosinophils or neutrophils. The absence of this relationship can be justified by the lack of specificity of the symptom questionnaires for the diagnosis of work-related rhinitis, since these are subjective, and we observed an increase in the percentages of these cells.

Thus, despite the absence of clinical tests to prove the existence of asthma and rhinitis in our population, the high specificity and sensitivity of the ISAAC asthma module scores justify the use of this instrument.

Folletti et al. systematically reviewed 24 studies addressing the relationship between cleaning work and respiratory conditions.

### Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorder: Is it what it seems to be [^114qfCP1]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

In conclusion, we demonstrated that eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EGEs) can precede the occurrence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Patients who remain persistently symptomatic or do not respond to treatment should be reassessed to exclude IBD, given its high prevalence in this group of patients.

- **Summary box**:
	- **What is already known**:
		- Eosinophilic esophagitis and gastroenteritis are chronic inflammatory conditions that can occur in response to allergens.
		- Eosinophilic esophagitis is defined as ≥ 15 eosinophils (Eo)/high power field (HPF), whereas eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorder in the rest of the gastrointestinal tract is usually defined as an eosinophilic count that exceeds 20 Eo/HPF.
		- Patients can present with dysphagia and a variety of non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.

	- **What the new findings are**:
		- Asthma, allergic rhinitis, and eczema can coexist in patients with eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders.
		- Inflammatory bowel disease can be preceded by eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders.
		- Patients with persistent symptoms and no explanation for the raised Eo on histology in the gastrointestinal tract should undergo repeat endoscopy.

### Inflammatory and infectious upper respiratory diseases associate with 41 genomic loci and type 2 inflammation [^114MEqPy]. Nature Communications (2023).

Inflammatory and infectious upper respiratory diseases (ICD-10: J30-J39), such as diseases of the sinonasal tract, pharynx, and larynx, are growing health problems, yet their genomic similarity is not well understood. We analyzed genome-wide associations for eight upper respiratory diseases (61,195 cases) among 260,405 FinnGen participants. We performed a meta-analysis of the diseases in four groups based on an underlying genetic correlation structure.

- **Genome-wide analysis**: Aiming to understand which genetic loci contribute to susceptibility to upper respiratory diseases in general and its subtypes, we detected 41 independent genome-wide significant loci, distinguishing the impact on sinonasal or pharyngeal diseases, or both.

- **Fine-mapping and phenome-wide analysis**: Fine-mapping implicated non-synonymous variants in nine genes, including three linked to immune-related diseases. Phenome-wide analysis implicated asthma and atopic dermatitis at sinonasal disease loci, and inflammatory bowel diseases and other immune-mediated disorders at pharyngeal disease loci. Upper respiratory diseases also genetically correlated with autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hypothyroidism, and psoriasis.

Finally, we associated separate gene pathways in sinonasal and pharyngeal diseases that both contribute to type 2 immunological reaction. We show shared heritability among upper respiratory diseases that extends to several immune-mediated diseases with diverse mechanisms, such as type 2 high inflammation.

### Rhinitis, sinusitis and asthma: One linked airway disease [^1124NyAa]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Understanding the relationship between upper and lower airways has greatly increased through epidemiological and pharmacological studies. Scientific evidence supports the concept that rhinosinusitis and asthma may be the expression of an inflammatory process which appears in different sites of the respiratory tract at different times. The implications are not only academic but are important for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

### Comorbidity between inflammatory bowel disease and asthma and allergic diseases: A genetically informed study [^116wguu6]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

The phenotypic bivariate correlations (within individual) between IBD and allergic diseases were weak for IBD with asthma (r = 0.05; 95% CI 0.01–0.09), allergic rhinitis (r = 0.07; 95% CI 0.03–0.11), and eczema (r = 0.11; 95% CI 0.07–0.15). Cross-twin cross-trait correlations were also weak but were higher for MZ twins than DZ twins for asthma and eczema with IBD, suggesting weak genetic influences [Table 2]. We also found similar results for male and female MZ and DZ twins [Supplementary Table 5].

- **Bivariate quantitative genetic modeling**: The AE model fitted best for all combinations of IBD with allergic diseases [Supplementary Tables 6–8]. Genetic correlations (rₐ) were low for IBD with each allergic disease, and CIs crossed the null [Table 2]. Unique environment correlations (rₑ) were slightly higher, but only IBD and eczema were statistically significant (rₑ = 0.16; 95% CI, 0.00–0.32) [Table 2].

### Comorbidity between inflammatory bowel disease and asthma and allergic diseases: A genetically informed study [^115wmZbr]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Asthma and its genetically related allergic diseases, such as allergic rhinitis and eczema, are early childhood-onset atopic diseases. They are characterized by a dysregulated adaptive immune response to environmental triggers and chronic inflammation in the affected tissues. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and its common subtypes — ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease — are lifelong systemic diseases that often exhibit both gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms. Although these diseases arise in different parts of the body — lungs, skin, nasal mucosa, and gastrointestinal tract — they may share pathogenesis through imbalance in microbiota composition, disruption of epithelial barrier function, or a similar embryologic origin.

Epidemiological studies have consistently indicated a high co-occurring prevalence (comorbidity) between asthma, allergic rhinitis, and eczema with IBD. These associations appear to be bidirectional, with no consistent pattern of whether allergic diseases may precede IBD or vice versa. Experimental studies have reported pathological processes that involve crosstalk between the gut and other mucosal tissues of the body, such as the lungs and the skin, suggesting a potential causal pathway between allergic diseases and IBD. Mendelian randomization studies have also addressed the issue of causality in an empirical way, using genetic variants as instrumental variables. However, results have not been consistent. Two studies investigating IBD and eczema, one using OpenGWAS data and the other using UK Biobank data, found contradictory results.

### Joint ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN guidelines on childhood eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders beyond eosinophilic esophagitis [^114aBBME]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

Non-esophageal eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders can be associated with a range of symptoms and conditions. These include:

- **Allergic conditions**: atopy, food allergy, asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**:
	- **Bowel-related issues**: bowel wall thickening, bloating, abdominal distension, bowel obstruction
	- **Pain and discomfort**: abdominal pain, abdominal cramps

### Association between allergic rhinitis, nasal polyps, chronic sinusitis and chronic respiratory diseases: A Mendelian randomization study [^1118arx3]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

In COPD, the persistent inflammation and oxidative stress induced by allergic rhinitis might exacerbate airway obstruction and lung parenchymal damage, accelerating disease progression and impairing pulmonary function. Bui et al. demonstrated that allergic rhinitis (AR) during childhood may elevate the susceptibility to COPD during later stages, but the underlying mechanisms and characteristics of the association between allergic rhinitis and COPD remain unclear. ILD, characterized by interstitial fibrosis and impaired gas exchange, may also be influenced by chronic airway inflammation and systemic immune dysregulation induced by allergic rhinitis. However, at the time of writing, there is a notable lack of observational study examining the relationship between allergic rhinitis and ILD. Further clinical and fundamental research is needed to explore the relationship between these two diseases.

Our findings suggested that nasal polyps are possibly associated with COPD and bronchiectasis. Alper Kelemence reported a high frequency of co-occurrence between nasal polyps and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), suggesting that the symptoms of nasal polyps may reflect the systemic inflammatory processes associated with COPD. J.M. Guilemany found that there is a high prevalence of nasal polyps in bronchiectasis patients and that the severity of bronchiectasis is related to the presence of nasal polyps.

### Allergic rhinitis and asthma: The link further unraveled [^115RxnvT]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Allergic asthma and rhinitis are manifestations of the atopic syndrome. Although these diseases commonly occur together, it remains unclear why some allergic patients develop only asthma and others only rhinitis. The variation in the clinical expression of allergic airway disease is not well understood. Besides genetic predisposition, environmental factors contribute to the development of the allergic phenotype. Local and systemic inflammatory processes also seem to be involved; however, their exact contribution to the clinical picture of airway allergy remains to be elucidated. It is evident that the condition of the upper airways impacts lower airway physiology, yet the mechanisms underlying this relationship are not fully resolved. Most data, at the time of writing, suggest a systemic link between the upper and lower airways, involving the bloodstream and bone marrow. This article reviews the latest developments regarding nasobronchial interaction in allergic airway disease. Epidemiologic, experimental, and clinical data underline the importance of a global approach to allergic rhinitis and asthma.

### Comorbidity between inflammatory bowel disease and asthma and allergic diseases: A genetically informed study [^116vbUL9]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Furthermore, our results concur with a large GWAS analysis carried out by Zhu et al. in 2018 using UK Biobank data. Although their primary focus was on the shared genetic architecture between asthma and allergic diseases, they extended the analysis to include several other immune-related traits such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Interestingly, they found almost no evidence of genetic correlation. Based on our null results from newer GWAS summary statistics and PRS analysis, we infer that IBD and allergic disease as immune-related traits may be genetically distinct. However, we still could not completely rule out an unidentifiable weak or local genetic overlap at the locus or gene level, as it is possible that a small number of common variants with potential antagonistic pleiotropy may have annulled the effects of shared risk loci and led to an underestimated genetic correlation. Furthermore, the phenotype heterogeneity of allergic rhinitis GWASs based on relatively small sample sizes has challenged the performance of PRS, which may have also contributed to a dilution of genetic correlation in our analysis.

There is some contradiction in our results regarding the familial co-aggregation analyses indicating a shared familial component, which was not supported by the quantitative genetic modeling. This indicates neither a shared genetic component nor a shared familial environment, but rather possibly a unique environmental component for IBD and eczema. Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility of a chance finding, we hypothesize that a possible unique environmental component may exist.

### Allergy-related diseases in childhood and risk for abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders at 16 years-a birth cohort study [^114R7bzA]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Childhood abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders (AP-FGIDs) are common, affecting 13–25% of children worldwide, and have significant implications for affected individuals, their families, and society. These disorders are diagnosed using diagnostic criteria, the most recent being the Rome IV criteria, as there are no biological markers or objective clinical findings defining these disorders. One of the most common AP-FGIDs is irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which is characterized by abdominal pain and altered bowel habits.

The pathophysiology of AP-FGIDs is not fully understood but is thought to involve multifactorial and complex gut-brain interactions. Proposed pathophysiological mechanisms include low-grade inflammation and immune dysfunction. The relevance of these mechanisms is supported by clinical observations such as the onset of IBS following an episode of infectious gastroenteritis and IBS-like symptoms in a substantial proportion of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and coeliac disease that are in remission. Furthermore, both child and adult studies have shown increased infiltration and activation of immune cells such as mast cells and eosinophils in some patients with IBS and functional dyspepsia (FD).

Allergy-related diseases have been linked to adult AP-FGIDs. Previous studies have shown that allergy-related diseases are positively associated with functional abdominal pain in pre-adolescents. While several other studies have explored the associations between asthma, allergic rhinitis, eczema, and pediatric AP-FGIDs, many have yet to fully elucidate these relationships.

### Comorbidity between inflammatory bowel disease and asthma and allergic diseases: A genetically informed study [^115SX9HK]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Little is known about shared origins between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and allergic diseases (asthma, allergic rhinitis, and eczema). We aimed to expand knowledge on the etiological sources of comorbidities between these disorders using a range of genetically informed methods.

- **Methods**: Within-individual and familial co-aggregation analysis was applied to 2,873,445 individuals born in Sweden from 1987 to 2014, along with their first- and second-degree relatives. Quantitative genetic modeling was applied to 38,723 twin pairs to decompose the genetic and environmental sources for comorbidity. Polygenic risk score analysis between IBD and allergic diseases was conducted in 48,186 genotyped twins, and linkage disequilibrium score regression was applied using publicly available data to explore the genetic overlap.

- **Results**: IBD was associated with asthma (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.30 to 1.40), allergic rhinitis (aOR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.34), and eczema (aOR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.38 to 1.56), with similar estimates for ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. The ORs for familial co-aggregation decreased with decreasing genetic relatedness. Quantitative genetic modeling revealed little evidence of common genetic factors between IBD and allergic diseases (e.g. IBD and allergic rhinitis; genetic correlation, rₐ = 0.06; 95% CI, −0.03 to 0.15) but did reveal some evidence of unique environmental factors between IBD and eczema (rₑ = 0.16; 95% CI, 0.00 to 0.32). Molecular genetic analyses were similarly null for IBD and allergic diseases.

### Pathogenesis of rhinitis [^115ruudv]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2016). Low credibility.

Rhinitis is a heterogeneous condition that has been associated with inflammatory responses, as seen in allergic rhinitis, but can also occur in the absence of inflammation, such as in so-called idiopathic (previously 'vasomotor') rhinitis. Allergic rhinitis affects approximately one in four individuals in westernized countries and is characterized by typical symptoms of nasal itching, sneezing, watery discharge, and congestion. This review illustrates key concepts of the pathogenesis of rhinitis. An imbalance in innate and adaptive immunity, together with environmental factors, is likely to play major roles.

In allergic rhinitis, initial allergen exposure and sensitization involve antigen-presenting cells, T and B lymphocytes, resulting in the generation of allergen-specific T cells and allergen-specific IgE antibodies. On re-exposure to relevant allergens, cross-linking of IgE on mast cells results in the release of mediators of hypersensitivity, such as histamine and immediate nasal symptoms. Within hours, there is an infiltration by inflammatory cells, particularly Th2 T lymphocytes, eosinophils, and basophils, into nasal mucosal tissue, resulting in the late-phase allergic response. Evidence for nasal priming and whether remodeling may be a feature of allergic rhinitis will be reviewed. The occurrence of so-called local allergic rhinitis in the absence of systemic IgE will be discussed. Non-allergic (non-IgE-mediated) rhinitis will be considered in the context of inflammatory and non-inflammatory disorders.

### Nasal involvement in allergic asthma [^111JF45d]. Allergy (2003). Low credibility.

Since the late 19th century, a relationship has been suspected between upper airway disease and the subsequent development or aggravation of asthma symptoms. At the time of writing, it is generally accepted that pathologic conditions of the upper airways, such as allergic rhinitis, chronic sinusitis, and nasal polyposis, may influence the lower airways. However, the mechanisms underlying this relationship were, for a long time, poorly understood. Recently, evidence has been accumulating which indicates a systemic connection as one of the responsible mechanisms in nasobronchial crosstalk. In this review, the pathophysiologic and immunologic aspects of the interaction between upper and lower airways will be discussed.

### Atopic irritable bowel syndrome: a novel subgroup of irritable bowel syndrome with allergic manifestations [^115tNM4m]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Mast cells have a primary role in atopy and may play a unique role in a subgroup of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This observation suggests a link between atopic disorders and IBS.

- **Objective**: To determine whether there is an association between atopic disorders and IBS.

- **Methods**: We undertook a prospective study using structured questionnaires. We administered questionnaires to 125 consecutive patients seen in the following clinics from July 1 through October 31, 2001: allergy/immunology (AI) (n = 39), gastroenterology (n = 36), and general medicine (n = 50). The survey included questions detailing gastrointestinal and allergic symptoms. Diagnosis of IBS was based on Rome II criteria, and diagnosis of atopy was based on clinical parameters.

- **Results**: The AI clinic reported a significantly higher rate of IBS than the general medicine clinic (P = 0.015). The IBS incidence reported in the AI clinic was similar to that reported in the gastroenterology clinic. The likelihood of IBS was significantly higher in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis (2.67 times; 95% confidence interval, 1.10–6.49; p = 0.03), patients with allergic eczema (3.85 times; 95% CI, 1.72–8.60; p = 0.001), and patients with depression (2.56 times; 95% CI, 1.05–6.14; p = 0.04). Patients reporting atopic symptoms (seasonal allergic rhinitis, allergic eczema, and asthma) were 3.20 times (95% CI, 1.20–8.50) more likely to fulfill the criteria for IBS (P = 0.02).

- **Conclusions**: Adults with atopic symptoms report a high incidence of IBS, suggesting a link between atopy and IBS.

### Current thinking on the relationship between rhinosinusitis and asthma [^111PxXxD]. The Journal of Asthma (2005). Low credibility.

An observation made initially on clinical grounds and epidemiologic evidence — that rhinosinusitis and asthma are closely linked diseases — is now supported by a growing body of scientific evidence. Most recent evidence supports the characterization of rhinosinusitis and asthma as two compartmental expressions of a common mucosal susceptibility to exogenous stimuli. Additionally, evidence suggests that these compartmental processes can affect and amplify each other via a systemic intermediary. The bone marrow is involved in this process, and IL-5 may be a key cytokine for orchestrating the systemic interaction. These facts argue that rhinosinusitis and asthma are not simply localized disease processes but part of a systemic inflammatory disease affecting the respiratory tract. They also provide a compelling rationale for combined treatment strategies, including considering the treatment of rhinosinusitis as a means of improving asthma control, and monitoring for signs of bronchial involvement in those with rhinosinusitis.

### Ongoing allergic rhinitis impairs asthma control by enhancing the lower airway inflammation [^114nf58m]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

The relationship between allergic rhinitis and asthma is well accepted; however, little is known about the mechanism that underlies the interactions between the upper and lower airways.

- **Objective**: To investigate the symptomatic and inflammatory linkages between allergic rhinitis and asthma in patients with atopy.

- **Methods**: We enrolled 520 patients with asthma who were taking inhaled corticosteroids and examined them by using the Asthma Control Questionnaire, spirometry, exhaled nitric oxide fraction (FENO), visual analog scale for nasal symptoms, allergic rhinitis questionnaire, and serum-specific IgE (study 1). The symptomatic and inflammatory marker responses to nasal corticosteroids in patients with incompletely controlled asthma (Asthma Control Questionnaire > 0.75) and moderate-to-severe persistent allergic rhinitis were also observed (study 2).

- **Results**: A total of 348 patients (66.9%) had atopy and allergic rhinitis. There was a striking difference in the proportion of patients with incomplete asthma control, depending on the presence as well as the activity of rhinitis (no rhinitis, 11.0%; mild intermittent, 20.4%; moderate-to-severe intermittent, 44.6%; mild persistent, 53.1%; moderate-to-severe persistent, 65.7%). The FENO levels were increased with the activity of rhinitis, and the nasal visual analog scale was positively correlated with the FENO levels (r = 0.31; P < .0001). The additive treatment with nasal corticosteroids improved the nasal visual analog scale, Asthma Control Questionnaire, and FENO levels, and the changes in these variables were observed.

### Inflammatory and infectious upper respiratory diseases associate with 41 genomic loci and type 2 inflammation [^111w4tMw]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Inflammatory and infectious upper respiratory diseases (IURD) affect the sinonasal tract, pharynx, and larynx. They include diseases such as chronic tonsillitis, allergic rhinitis, and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), leading to increased morbidity, costs, and a significant public health burden by serving as the primary route of infection to the body. They are also associated with non-communicable diseases, such as asthma, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and obesity. Genetic predisposition, together with environmental megatrends like the COVID-19 pandemic, Western lifestyle, urbanization, global warming, and dysbiosis, influence the burden of IURDs. IURDs often co-exist and exhibit overlapping mechanisms. Understanding the genetic (dis)similarities behind IURDs can significantly improve preventive actions and therapies, reducing the burden of IURDs and related diseases.

IURDs are characterized by an etiology related to reinfections and dysbiosis, leading to chronic and treatment-resistant diseases with acute and potentially life-threatening exacerbations. They involve inflammation in the nasal cavity, such as vasomotor and allergic rhinitis (VAR), both characterized by hyperresponsiveness to stimuli; non-specific chronic rhinitis, nasopharyngitis and pharyngitis (CRNP), and nasal septal deviation (NSD); as well as in the adjoining paranasal sinuses, such as CRS with or without nasal polyps (NP). Allergic rhinitis (AR) is part of an allergic disease entity involving allergic asthma, atopic dermatitis, and allergic conjunctivitis.

### Comorbidity between inflammatory bowel disease and asthma and allergic diseases: A genetically informed study [^111Wm9Kc]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2024). High credibility.

In this study, which used several population-based samples and employed four different genetically informed analysis methods, we found minimal to no evidence for a genetic correlation between IBD and each of the allergic diseases — asthma, allergic rhinitis, and eczema.

- **Familial co-aggregation analysis**: Suggested a modest familial association between IBD and each allergic disease, particularly for Crohn's disease, which either implies a genetic or shared environmental cause of comorbidity.
- **Quantitative genetic modeling**: Showed that although IBD and each allergic disease individually exhibited a moderate-to-high heritability, there was a weak to negligible genetic correlation between IBD and each allergic disease. Furthermore, there was suggestive evidence for a unique environmental component explaining the comorbidity of IBD and eczema.
- **PRS and LDSC analyses**: Revealed no compelling evidence for a genetic overlap between IBD and allergic diseases except for a possible weak bidirectional association between IBD and eczema.

There has been considerable interest in the relationship between asthma and other comorbid immune-mediated conditions, whereas there has been less interest regarding IBD. With the fundamental link to atopy between asthma, allergic rhinitis, and eczema, this study comprehensively investigated the association between these three common allergic conditions and IBD within individuals and families. We showed approximately 18% prevalence of asthma, 31% allergic rhinitis, 16% eczema, and 0.7% IBD, which is slightly above or aligns closely with existing data.

### Relationship between cutaneous allergen response and airway allergen-induced eosinophilia [^114Tkep9]. Allergy (2003). Low credibility.

Determinants of changes in airway caliber after allergen challenge include nonallergic airway responsiveness, immune response, and dose of allergen given. However, determinants of the airway inflammatory response to allergens remain to be determined.

- **Aim**: To assess the relationship between skin reactivity to airborne allergens and lower airway eosinophilic response to allergen exposure in asthma and allergic rhinitis.

- **Methods**: Forty-two subjects with mild allergic asthma (mean age 24 years) and 14 non-asthmatic subjects with allergic rhinitis (mean age 25 years) had allergen skin prick tests and titration with the allergen chosen for subsequent challenge. On a second visit, 31 asthmatic subjects had a conventional challenge, while 11 asthmatic subjects and all rhinitic subjects had a low-dose allergen challenge over four subsequent days. Induced sputum samples were obtained at 6 and 24 hours after the conventional challenge and at days 2 and 4 of the low-dose challenge.

- **Results**: In the asthmatic group, there was a weak correlation between wheal diameter induced by the concentration used for the challenge and an increase in eosinophils 6 hours post-conventional challenge (r = 0.372, P = 0.05), but no correlation was observed following the low-dose challenge. Rhinitic subjects showed a correlation between wheal diameter with the allergen dose used for bronchoprovocation and an increase in eosinophils at day 2 of the low dose (r = 0.608, P = 0.02).

- **Conclusion**: This study suggests that immediate immune responsiveness to an allergen, assessed by the magnitude of the skin response, is a signal of subsequent responses to allergen exposure.

### The role of pseudoephedrine on daytime somnolence in patients suffering from perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR) [^115D5LYH]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Allergic rhinitis is one of several inflammatory diseases affecting the nasal mucosa. Cellular inflammation of the nasal mucosa is a hallmark of this disease and is characterized by the accumulation of eosinophils and the release of various chemical messengers such as chemokines, cytokines, and histamine. This inflammation leads to nasal congestion and a reduction in sleep quality, resulting in daytime somnolence.

- **Objective**: Drugs that significantly reduce the symptoms of nasal congestion may also help in alleviating sleep-related symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Pseudoephedrine is a sympathomimetic amine indicated for the treatment of nasal congestion associated with allergic rhinitis. Despite its efficacy in relieving nasal congestion, we speculated that, due to pseudoephedrine's well-known stimulant profile, sleep would not be improved.

- **Method**: Fourteen subjects who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study to receive either pseudoephedrine or placebo once per day in the morning, using the traditional crossover design. Skin testing was performed to ensure a positive response to a relevant perennial allergen and a negative response to a seasonal allergen. Several questionnaires were used to evaluate the patients' sleep-related symptoms, allergic rhinitis symptoms, and quality of life.

- **Results**: Our results indicated that pseudoephedrine did not have a positive or negative effect on the quality of sleep, daytime sleepiness, or daytime fatigue compared to placebo. Pseudoephedrine did show statistical signific

### Comorbidity between inflammatory bowel disease and asthma and allergic diseases: A genetically informed study [^115KDPsE]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Within the population-based cohort, we observed an increased risk of having asthma, allergic rhinitis, and eczema within individuals (probands) who had inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) after adjusting for sex, parity, and birth year. The adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were 1.35 (95% CI, 1.30–1.40), 1.27 (95% CI, 1.20–1.34), and 1.47 (95% CI, 1.38–1.56), respectively. Odds ratios were slightly higher for Crohn's disease than ulcerative colitis with each allergic disease.

- **Familial co-aggregation**: The analysis showed a decrease in associations toward the null in a stepwise fashion with decreasing relatedness (genetic and shared environment), suggesting a shared origin between IBD and allergic diseases. For first-degree relatives (full siblings and parents), all effect sizes between allergic diseases and IBD, ulcerative colitis, or Crohn's disease were lower compared to the within-individual results. Associations for second-degree relatives (half-siblings) were close to null.

For example, the association between asthma and Crohn's disease within an individual had an aOR of 1.47 (95% CI, 1.38–1.56). Between probands (IBD) and full siblings (Crohn's disease), the aOR was 1.25 (95% CI, 1.17–1.33), between probands (IBD) and parents (Crohn's disease) it was 1.25 (95% CI, 1.20–1.29), and between probands (IBD) and half-siblings (Crohn's disease), the maternal aOR was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.82–1.14) and the paternal aOR was 1.01 (95% CI, 0.88–1.15).

### The unified immune system: Respiratory tract-nasobronchial interaction mechanisms in allergic airway disease [^115EPDYG]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Allergy is a systemic disorder that can affect the nose, lungs, eyes, skin, and gastrointestinal tract, simultaneously or in succession, during the course of a patient's life. The reason for the variety in clinical expression of allergic disease is not known. Genetic predisposition, as well as environmental factors, contribute to the development of the allergic phenotype. Local and systemic inflammatory processes also seem to play a role; however, their exact contribution to the clinical manifestation of airway allergy still remains to be clarified. Although it is clear that allergen exposure of a sensitized target organ is associated with immunopathologic changes at the level of other target organs, the mechanisms underlying this relationship are far from being resolved. Today, most data suggest a systemic link between mucosal sites, involving the bloodstream, bone marrow, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. This review will focus on the interaction between the nose and lungs in allergic disease and the possible implications for the gastrointestinal mucosa.

### Recent patents in allergy/immunology: Use of arginase inhibitors in the treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis [^114bSRUm]. Allergy (2019). Low credibility.

- **Pathways of arginine metabolism**: Arginine metabolism plays a crucial role in allergen-induced airway obstruction, airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and enhanced allergen sensitivity. Nitric oxide (NO) is synthesized from arginine by constitutive and inducible synthases. NO has bronchodilatory and anti-inflammatory actions and inhibits mediator release from mast cells. Arginine is also metabolized to ornithine and urea by arginases 1 and 2. Th2 cytokines, such as interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13), and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) induce increased arginase expression and activity. This reduces the availability of arginine to the synthases, decreasing NO production and inducing the production of superoxide anion. The resulting formation of peroxynitrite, a reaction product, exerts pro-contractile and pro-inflammatory actions in the airways.

- **Contributions to pathology**: These processes collectively contribute to allergen-induced airway obstruction, airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and increased sensitivity to allergens. Additionally, increased synthesis of ornithine from arginase provides a precursor for polyamines and proline, stimulating cell proliferation and collagen production, respectively, leading to airway remodeling.

Supporting evidence for the role of arginase in the pathophysiology of allergic asthma and potentially other allergic disorders like allergic rhinitis was found in a guinea pig model of allergic asthma.

### Rhinitis and asthma: Evidence for respiratory system integration [^112F7mSK]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

The vast majority of patients with asthma have rhinitis, and rhinitis is a major independent risk factor for asthma in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. The relationships between rhinitis and asthma can be viewed under the concept that the two conditions are manifestations of one syndrome, the chronic allergic respiratory syndrome, in two parts of the respiratory tract.

At the low end of the syndrome's severity spectrum, rhinitis appears to be the sole manifestation, although pathologic abnormalities in the lower airways are already present. At the higher end, rhinitis worsens, and the lower airways disease becomes clinically evident. Once manifested, the two conditions track in parallel in terms of severity. This parallel relationship is influenced by many interactions between the nasal and the lower airways.

Some interactions stem from the fact that the nasal passages play a major homeostatic role by conditioning inhaled air. However, perhaps even more important is the bidirectional interaction resulting from systemic inflammation produced after local allergic reactions. Successful management of the chronic allergic respiratory syndrome requires an integrated view of the airways and an understanding of their interactions.

### Lung-gut cross-talk: Evidence, mechanisms and implications for the mucosal inflammatory diseases [^114WGA4u]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2016). Low credibility.

The mucosal immune system, including the airway, intestinal, oral, and cervical epithelium, is an integrated network of tissues, cells, and effector molecules that protect the host from environmental insults and infections at mucous membrane surfaces. Dysregulation of immunity at mucosal surfaces is believed to contribute to the alarming global increase in mucosal inflammatory diseases, such as those affecting the gastrointestinal system (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and irritable bowel syndrome) and the respiratory system (asthma, allergy, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder). Although immune regulation has been well-studied in isolated mucosal sites, the extent of immune interaction between anatomically distant mucosal sites has been mostly circumstantial and a matter of debate.

With the advent of novel technology and more precise tools to examine histological and functional changes in tissues, there is now increased appreciation for the 'common mucosal immunological system' originally proposed by Bienenstock nearly 40 years ago. There is growing evidence indicating that stimulation of one mucosal compartment can directly and significantly impact a distant mucosal site; however, the mechanisms remain unknown. We are only beginning to understand the complexity of the relationships and communications that exist between different mucosal compartments. A holistic approach to studying the mucosal immune system as an integrated global organ is imperative for future advances in understanding mucosal immunology and for developing treatments for chronic diseases.

### Introduction to nasal and pulmonary allergy cascade [^116hk2Bb]. Allergy (2002). Low credibility.

The early phase of an IgE-dependent allergic reaction is followed by the activation of a complex network of inflammatory phenomena — T lymphocytes, cytokines, mediators, and adhesion molecules — that mediate late and ongoing allergic symptoms. The kinetics of respiratory inflammation following allergen exposure involve the migration of inflammatory cells to the mucosa within about 30 minutes, increased inflammatory infiltration over the following hours, and then slow subsidence.

A relationship between asthma and allergic rhinitis is supported by epidemiological, histological, physiological, and immunopathological data, and by the response of asthma symptoms in rhinitic patients to intranasal corticosteroids and antihistamines. For example, there is no morphological difference between the bronchial inflammatory response following allergen-specific challenge in patients suffering from asthma alone or rhinitis alone. It is the allergen dose that makes the difference in the airway response to allergen in allergic rhinitis and asthma.

Recognition of the relationship between asthma and allergic rhinitis has led to the introduction of new diagnostic terminology and treatment recommendations:

- **Patients with persistent rhinitis**: Should be evaluated for asthma.
- **Patients with persistent asthma**: Should be evaluated for rhinitis.
- **Treatment strategy**: A strategy should combine the treatment of upper and lower airways in terms of efficacy and safety.

### Comorbidity between inflammatory bowel disease and asthma and allergic diseases: A genetically informed study [^113iTZZA]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Within-individual association and family co-aggregation of atopic diseases and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): The presented estimates are based on models adjusted for birth year, sex, and parity. CD, Crohn's disease; CI, confidence interval; OR, odds ratio; UC, ulcerative colitis.

Using the twin subcohorts, we observed that ORs of MZ twins having asthma, allergic rhinitis, or eczema when their co-twin had IBD were mostly above 1, although with broad CIs. ORs again were slightly higher for Crohn's disease than ulcerative colitis. However, no clear associations were seen among DZ twins for the co-aggregation of allergic diseases and IBD.

- **Quantitative genetic modeling**: Univariate results of the twin subcohorts found higher correlations for each allergic disease or IBD in MZ twins compared with DZ twins, suggesting genetic heritability for each disease. Sex-specific correlations for each allergic disease and IBD were similar between males and females. Univariate quantitative genetic modeling identified AE as the best-fitting model (with lowest Akaike information criterion) for most diseases and suggested a minimal role of dominant genetic or shared environmental influences. In the AE model, additive genetic components explained 75% of the variance in liability for IBD (95% CI, 0.68–0.82), 53% variance for allergic rhinitis (95% CI, 0.51–0.55), and 44% variance for eczema (95% CI, 0.41–0.47). However, the ACE model fitted asthma best, with 66% of the variance explained by additive genetic factors.

### Gut matters: Microbe-host interactions in allergic diseases [^116C9LFW]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

The human body can be considered a metaorganism made up of its own eukaryotic cells and trillions of microbes that colonize superficial body sites, such as the skin, airways, and gastrointestinal tract. The coevolution of host and microbes has brought about a variety of molecular mechanisms, which ensure a peaceful relationship.

The mammalian barrier and immune functions warrant simultaneous protection of the host against deleterious infections, as well as tolerance toward harmless commensals. Because these pivotal host functions evolved under high microbial pressure, they evidently depend on a complex network of microbe-host interactions.

The rapid spread of immune-mediated disorders, such as autoimmune diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases, and allergies, in westernized countries is thus thought to be due to environmentally mediated disturbances of this microbe-host interaction network. The aim of the present review is to highlight the importance of the intestinal microbiota in shaping host immune mechanisms, with particular emphasis on allergic diseases and possible intervention strategies.

### Upper airway disorders and asthma: A syndrome of airway inflammation [^115Bpf9U]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

This article presents recent evidence of a link between upper and lower airways. After reading this article, readers should understand the evidence for the pathologic relationship between asthma and upper airway disorders such as rhinosinusitis and allergic rhinitis.

- **Data sources**: Epidemiologic, pathophysiologic, and treatment outcomes studies were used. Only literature in the English language was reviewed.

- **Study selection**: Material was taken from academic and scholarly journals.

- **Results**: Epidemiologic data indicate that asthma and allergic rhinitis frequently coexist, with rhinitis symptoms reported among 19 to 94% of asthma patients, and asthma reported among 19 to 38% of those with allergic rhinitis. Allergic rhinitis often precedes asthma symptomatology and has been shown to be a risk factor for the development of asthma. The severity of allergic rhinitis has also been shown to be directly correlated with asthma severity. Patients with allergic rhinitis exhibit increased eosinophil activity in both upper and lower airways. In these patients, nasal allergen challenge can induce increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness, suggesting that upper and lower airway disorders share common inflammatory features. Treatment of rhinitis symptoms has been shown to produce better asthma symptom control and, in a few studies, improvement of airway function in patients with concomitant asthma.

- **Conclusions**: Evidence suggests that upper respiratory disorders such as allergic rhinitis and rhinosinusitis are different facets of a larger systemic inflammatory syndrome.

### Increased allergic rhinitis prevalence and symptom severity in patients with irritable bowel syndrome [^115wrdh4]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have an increased risk of developing both airway and allergic diseases. However, the relationship between allergic rhinitis (AR), one of the most common chronic upper airway inflammatory diseases, and IBS remains poorly understood. The aim of this study is to provide a better understanding of airway complications in patients with IBS and to evaluate the presence of potential airborne and dietary antigen cross-reactivity in concomitant IBS and AR.

- **Methods**: A total of 287 participants, including 54 healthy volunteers without gastrointestinal complaints and 232 patients fulfilling Rome IV criteria, were invited to complete self-administered questionnaires assessing the severity of upper airway symptoms and the prevalence of allergic rhinitis.

- **Results**: Overall, patients with IBS had a threefold higher risk of questionnaire-based allergic rhinitis than control subjects (95% CI, 1.49–6.12). Furthermore, patients with IBS+AR showed reduced sleep quality, mood, and personal satisfaction associated with their upper airway complaints compared to IBS patients without AR. Forty-seven percent (18/38) of IBS+AR patients reported IBS symptoms in response to ingestion of food items with molecular mimicry of the aeroallergen to which the patient is sensitized.

- **Conclusion**: Our study shows that patients with IBS have an increased frequency of concomitant allergic rhinitis, which contributes to a further reduction in quality of life. We also provide evidence of potential cross-reactive reactions between aeroallergens and dietary antigens.

### Allergy-related diseases in childhood and risk for abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders at 16 years-a birth cohort study [^117GWvLf]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Studies on allergy-related diseases in relation to abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders (AP-FGIDs) in children are few, and results are contradictory. We examined the associations between childhood allergy-related diseases and adolescent AP-FGIDs in general, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in particular.

- **Method**: Prospective population-based birth cohort study of 4089 children born in Sweden from 1994 to 1996. We analyzed data from 2949 children with complete follow-up at 16 years (y) and no diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease or celiac disease at 12y or 16y. Asthma, rhinitis, eczema, and food hypersensitivity (FH) were assessed through questionnaires at ages 1–2y, 4y, 8y, 12y, and 16y. AP-FGIDs and IBS were assessed through questionnaires at 16y and defined according to the Rome III criteria. Associations between childhood allergy-related diseases and any AP-FGID and IBS at 16y were examined using binomial generalized linear models with a log link function and described as relative risk with 95% confidence intervals.

- **Results**: The prevalence of any AP-FGID and IBS at 16y were 12.0% and 6.0%, respectively. Eczema at ages 1–2y, 4y, and 8y, and FH at 12y and 16y were associated with an increased risk for any AP-FGID at 16y. Asthma and FH at 12y and 16y were associated with an increased risk for IBS at 16y. The relative risk for IBS at 16y increased with the number of allergy-related diseases at 16y. However, the linear trend for relative risk was only borderline statistically significant (P for trend = 0.05).

### Early antibiotic exposure and development of asthma and allergic rhinitis in childhood [^11427eyq]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

The gut microbiota is comprised of trillions of microbes in the human intestinal tract and contains over a thousand different species of bacteria. Previous studies have suggested that the first year of life represents a critical period of development and that by about three years of age, the microbiota is fully mature. The gut microbiota also plays an important role in the human immune system and maintenance of homeostasis. Alterations in the gut microbiota are a purported mechanism underlying the "hygiene hypothesis", in which children exposed to a wide range of environmental and nutritional factors that promote a diverse and robust microbiota are less prone to atopy and asthma.

In fact, gut dysbiosis has been linked to early disruptions in the regulation of the immune system, and thus to the development of chronic atopic and inflammatory respiratory diseases such as asthma and allergic rhinitis. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), the prevalence of these diseases in the United States has continued to rise in the past two decades despite significant medical advancements.

New evidence suggests that there may be a connection between early antibiotic exposure altering the development of the gut microbiota and subsequently the immune system, increasing the risk for developing the aforementioned diseases. However, relatively few studies have investigated the effects of the timing of antibiotic exposure on future health outcomes, and whether there is a period during early development when the gut microbiota is most susceptible.

### Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorder: Is it what it seems to be [^112DwKad]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients who had undergone upper gastrointestinal or lower gastrointestinal endoscopy between January 2014 and December 2015, and who had eosinophilic infiltration of the gastrointestinal tract on histology, were retrospectively identified through the histopathology database.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Patients over 18 years of age were included if eosinophilic infiltration was present in esophageal, gastric, small bowel, and colonic biopsies (defined as eosinophilic infiltration ≥ 15 eosinophils per high power field (Eo/HPF) for esophageal involvement and > 20 Eo/HPF for the rest of the gastrointestinal tract) and if there was an absence of histological samples suggesting another cause of eosinophilia.

- **Exclusion criteria**:
	1. Age under 18 years.
	2. Recent infective gastroenteritis (defined as less than three months prior).
	3. Previous diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and/or celiac disease.
	4. Drug-induced pathologies.
	5. Graft-versus-host disease.
	6. History of connective tissue disorders and/or vasculitis.
	7. Previous radiotherapy to the abdomen.
	8. Primary hypereosinophilic syndrome.
	9. Myeloproliferative neoplasms.

Patients were then interviewed using a questionnaire to determine their gastrointestinal symptoms at the time of endoscopy and to check if they had symptoms of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and/or eczema. All patients had a complete blood count with measurement of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies. Patients who presented with loose stools had stool samples checked for culture, ova, cysts, and parasites.

### Allergy-related diseases in childhood and risk for abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders at 16 years-a birth cohort study [^116MaPPS]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Compared to healthy peers, adolescents with AP-FGIDs in our study had a higher prevalence of FH at ages 12 and 16. This is consistent with previous studies; although our prevalence of FH was lower than what has been reported by others in similar age groups. Previous studies, however, were conducted on selected patient samples. Furthermore, they were designed to assess FH and/or dietary interventions, which might have led to the selection of children with more food-related symptoms. Longitudinal studies of FH and the risk for subsequent AP-FGIDs are limited. Saps et al. found cow's milk allergy during the first year of life to predispose for pre-adolescent AP-FGIDs, but studies assessing FH in general (as opposed to a single food item) are lacking.

We did not assess allergy-related diseases and discrete AP-FGIDs, but the differences in results for AP-FGIDs vs. IBS suggest that associations may differ between subtypes. Furthermore, although the P for trend was not statistically significant, the number of allergy-related diseases increased the RR for IBS, while the RR for any AP-FGID remained unaffected. This might suggest that allergy is more connected to IBS than to other AP-FGID subtypes. Except for the study by Kumari et al. discussed above, we found no additional studies that have addressed this issue in children. Hence, it would be of clinical and potentially mechanistic interest to stratify for different AP-FGID subtypes when assessing associations with allergy-related diseases in future studies.

Possible explanations of our results include shared pathophysiological mechanisms.

### Highly significant linkage to chromosome 3q13.31 for rhinitis and related allergic diseases [^113kdYh6]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2006). Low credibility.

Allergic diseases such as asthma and rhinitis have closely related phenotypes and often occur with atopy. They show strong familial and intra-individual clustering, suggesting overlapping disease aetiology. Various loci and candidate genes have been suggested to underlie allergy, though many remain inconclusive. Following genome-wide scans on multiple phenotypes, we previously suggested that chromosome 3q13.12-q21.2 harbours an allergy locus.

- **Objective**: To identify candidate loci in the Danish population, two additional independent sets of sib-pair families were fine-scale mapped in candidate regions showing maximum likelihood scores (MLS) ≥ 1.5 in the genome-wide scans.

- **Results**: Twenty-eight microsatellite markers in a denser map on chromosome 3q were analysed in 236 allergy sib-pair families, including 125 sib pairs with rhinitis. We report significant evidence for linkage to chromosome 3q13.31 for rhinitis (MLS 5.55, identity by descent (IBD) 63.9%) and atopy (increased specific immunoglobulin E) (MLS 3.71, IBD 61.7%). We obtained an MLS of 5.1 (IBD 67.3%) at 3q13.31 when sib pairs with both rhinitis and atopy were analysed.

- **Conclusion**: This study reports the first statistically significant evidence for a genetic susceptibility locus for rhinitis and, to our knowledge, shows the most significant evidence at the time of writing of linkage for any allergy phenotype.

### Chronic rhinosinusitis in the setting of other chronic inflammatory diseases [^112Mmro2]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2010). Low credibility.

The objectives of the study were to determine the prevalence of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) overall and its two phenotypic variants, CRS with and without nasal polyposis (NP), in patients with chronic inflammatory comorbidities, including autoimmune disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, and atopic dermatitis. These findings were compared with data in patients with asthma. Patients with hypertension were also used as a reference group to estimate the incidence of CRS in a group with regular medical follow-up.

A retrospective, cross-sectional query of a large tertiary care electronic medical record database was performed. The electronic medical record database indicated that the prevalence of CRS in patients with hypertension was 4.4%. The prevalence of CRS was 18% in asthma (P < .0001), 7% in atopic dermatitis, 3.5% in inflammatory bowel disease, and ranged from 1.4% to 5.9% in autoimmune disorders. The frequency of CRS patients exhibiting the NP phenotype was similarly low in patients with autoimmune disease and hypertension, but was significantly greater in patients with asthma (P < .0001), inflammatory bowel disease (P = 0.033), and atopic dermatitis (P = 0.049).

These findings suggest a similar prevalence of overall CRS in patients with autoimmune disease and inflammatory bowel disease, and background rates as estimated by observations in hypertension patients. Inflammatory bowel disease and atopic dermatitis patients with CRS exhibit some skewing toward the NP phenotype, as do asthmatics, where this association is well known.

### Epithelial-neuronal-immune cell interactions: Implications for immunity, inflammation, and tissue homeostasis at mucosal sites [^117GY7HY]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2024). Low credibility.

The epithelial lining of the respiratory tract and intestine provides a critical physical barrier to protect host tissues against environmental insults, including dietary antigens, allergens, chemicals, and microorganisms. In addition, specialized epithelial cells communicate directly with hematopoietic and neuronal cells. These epithelial-immune and epithelial-neuronal interactions control host immune responses and have important implications for inflammatory conditions associated with defects in the epithelial barrier, including asthma, allergy, and inflammatory bowel diseases. In this review, we discuss emerging research that identifies the mechanisms and impact of epithelial-immune and epithelial-neuronal cross talk in regulating immunity, inflammation, and tissue homeostasis at mucosal barrier surfaces. Understanding the regulation and impact of these pathways could provide new therapeutic targets for inflammatory diseases at mucosal sites.
