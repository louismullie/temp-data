## Question

What is the PO dosing of quetiapine fumarate, and is it used for sundowning in dementia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to dose quetiapine fumarate orally and whether it is used for "sundowning" in dementia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory status and boxed warnings because that frames any dosing advice. Then, I should define "sundowning" within the broader context of BPSD and verify guideline recommendations for first-line management. Next, I will extract practical PO dosing ranges actually used in older adults for BPSD-like targets and delirium, and reconcile them with pharmacokinetics. After that, I need to weigh benefits versus risks and outline monitoring and deprescribing. Finally, I will synthesize a sundowning-specific, stepwise approach and state clearly whether and how quetiapine is used off-label for this purpose, with a concrete starting dose and titration plan based on the evidence.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory guardrails. Quetiapine carries a boxed warning and is not indicated for dementia-related psychosis in elderly patients due to increased mortality and cerebrovascular risk, so any use for behavioral symptoms in dementia would be off-label and must be highly judicious [^113ZYVxF] [^113Zv52s].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "sundowning". I should define it correctly. Sundowning is commonly conceptualized as evening or nighttime agitation, confusion, or behavioral escalation within the broader spectrum of Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD), for which first-line treatment is nonpharmacologic, including addressing triggers, caregiver education, environmental modification, and structured routines, before any antipsychotic is considered [^117DZFDW] [^111XXFqk] [^112Tp5sw]. I need to ensure reversible contributors such as pain, infection, dehydration, medications, and environmental stressors are evaluated and treated first, as emphasized by European guidance on agitation in dementia [^111561ds].

> Now, I will examine effectiveness data for quetiapine in BPSD-like indications to avoid overestimating its role. Evidence for quetiapine's benefit in agitation or psychosis in dementia is inconsistent; a randomized trial in institutionalized Alzheimer's patients showed no improvement in agitation and signaled worse cognition versus placebo, which gives me pause about routine use for "sundowning" behaviors [^1151LbYm]. In patients with dementia plus parkinsonism, quetiapine was generally well tolerated without worsening motor symptoms, but the 10‑week placebo-controlled trial did not demonstrate significant efficacy, suggesting any benefit is uncertain at typical mean doses around 120 mg/day [^1142hTpw]. This aligns with broader appraisals noting mixed or modest effects of atypical antipsychotics for BPSD and significant safety concerns, reinforcing that they are not first-line for sundowning [^114PoC9D] [^114DcgFB].

> Wait, I should verify comparative options because that may change my recommendation. Risperidone has the strongest short-term evidence for agitation and aggression in dementia, and recent guidance suggests offering risperidone for acute neuropsychiatric symptoms, whereas quetiapine data are less consistent; additionally, brexpiprazole is now recommended for agitation due to Alzheimer's disease, which may be more appropriate when medication is needed after nonpharmacologic measures fail [^115TqoQp] [^112XHLSM] [^117HxWTY] [^1148tZwJ]. That said, I need to consider motor tolerability; quetiapine's lower extrapyramidal symptom liability can make it a pragmatic off-label choice in patients with coexisting parkinsonism when a brief antipsychotic trial is unavoidable, even though efficacy is uncertain [^114SEhkV] [^1142hTpw].

> I will now extract practical PO dosing parameters used in older adults, keeping "start low, go slow" in mind. For delirium or agitation-like targets in adults, quetiapine has been used in ranges of 25–200 mg/day, and some dosing schemas start 25–100 mg at bedtime, which fits a sedating, evening-peaked symptom like sundowning, though I should confirm the pharmacokinetics and real-world dosing in dementia populations before finalizing a recommendation [^1142Tftu] [^113JWLxv]. Let me verify PK: the IR formulation reaches peak at about 1.5 hours with a mean half-life near 6 hours, so bedtime dosing may attenuate nocturnal symptoms while limiting daytime sedation, which supports QHS initiation and careful titration [^1175oEd7]. Hmm, wait a minute, I previously thought higher doses might be required, but real-world and trial data in AD often use lower means, such as approximately 37.5 mg/day with oral solution in outpatients and around 56.5 mg/day in a large comparative trial, suggesting many older adults respond or are managed in the 25–75 mg/day range, not hundreds of milligrams, which I should reflect in my dosing advice [^116HJJSb] [^114PoC9D]. That said, in parkinsonism cohorts, mean doses near 120 mg/day were used without clear efficacy; thus, I should caution that higher doses do not guarantee benefit and may increase adverse effects in this population [^1142hTpw].

> Let me synthesize a pragmatic, off-label dosing approach when a measured trial is justified after nonpharmacologic measures have failed and symptoms are severe or pose danger or marked distress. I would start quetiapine IR 12.5–25 mg orally at bedtime, then titrate by 12.5–25 mg increments every 2–3 days based on evening and overnight behaviors, aiming for the lowest effective dose, with many older adults stabilized between 25 and 100 mg/day and seldom needing more than 150–200 mg/day for this target, acknowledging limited and mixed efficacy data and aligning with "smallest effective dose for the shortest duration" principles; note that 12.5 mg was used as an initial geriatric dose in a randomized inpatient trial for delirium prevention, informing this low starting point in frailer patients [^117DZFDW] [^1142Tftu] [^113JWLxv] [^1154hXnz]. If daytime symptoms emerge, a cautious divided regimen can be considered, but I need to ensure orthostasis and sedation do not worsen falls risk, favoring consolidation to QHS whenever possible given the half-life [^1175oEd7].

> I should double-check the risk–benefit framework and monitoring plan, because these determine whether continuing therapy is appropriate. Atypical antipsychotics, including quetiapine, are associated with increased mortality and cerebrovascular events in dementia; thus, antipsychotics should be reserved for severe, dangerous, or highly distressing symptoms, not routine sundowning, and they should be reassessed frequently and deprescribed when possible [^113ZYVxF] [^111YgjJr] [^116e5BYn]. I need to ensure shared decision-making with the patient or surrogate about goals, benefits, and harms, document monthly symptom ratings to quantify response, and if there is no clinically significant benefit after about 4 weeks at an adequate dose, taper and discontinue rather than persist indefinitely; if there is benefit, plan to attempt taper within 4 months, with monitoring during the taper and for at least 4 months after discontinuation to detect relapse early [^113hWHC8] [^1137QfpY] [^117MKpYe] [^1113WtHS] [^116S73zn] [^1168tc98]. I need to monitor for orthostatic hypotension, sedation, metabolic effects, falls, and drug–drug interactions; and although data are limited, a case report of intracerebral hemorrhage occurred when quetiapine was added to warfarin, so I should use extra caution and INR vigilance in anticoagulated patients [^117DZFDW] [^112ZmqWS].

> But wait, what if nonpharmacologic strategies alone could address evening agitation. I should prioritize bright light exposure, regular daytime activity, consistent sleep–wake and caregiving routines, caregiver skills training, and environmental modifications before considering any antipsychotic for sundowning, as these are first-line and safer, and often effective when individualized to triggers like pain, overstimulation, or unmet needs; only if these fail and risk remains high should a short pharmacologic trial be considered, with alternatives such as risperidone or brexpiprazole supported by more consistent evidence for agitation in AD, reserving quetiapine particularly when parkinsonism or EPS sensitivity is a key concern, and always with a predefined stop/taper plan [^112Tp5sw] [^117HxWTY] [^1148tZwJ] [^114SEhkV].

> Final answer synthesis: Is quetiapine used for sundowning in dementia. Let me reconsider and be precise. It is not approved for dementia-related psychosis and is not specifically indicated for sundowning; however, in practice, it is sometimes used off-label for severe evening agitation after nonpharmacologic measures fail, with inconsistent efficacy and a boxed warning that necessitates careful risk–benefit assessment and time-limited use [^113ZYVxF] [^113Zv52s] [^1151LbYm]. If used, a cautious PO regimen would be quetiapine IR 12.5–25 mg at bedtime, titrating by 12.5–25 mg every few days as needed and tolerated, with many older adults maintained between 25 and 100 mg/day and rarely exceeding 150–200 mg/day, alongside monthly quantitative monitoring, 4‑week reassessment for efficacy, and a planned deprescribing attempt within 4 months if benefit is observed, all while continuing aggressive nonpharmacologic management and considering alternatives with stronger evidence when medication is necessary [^113JWLxv] [^1142Tftu] [^114PoC9D] [^116HJJSb] [^1113WtHS] [^117DZFDW] [^111YgjJr].

---

Quetiapine fumarate PO is **not recommended for routine management** of dementia-related sundowning due to limited efficacy and significant risks, including increased mortality and cerebrovascular events [^116e5BYn] [^114PoC9D]. It should **only be considered when nonpharmacologic measures have failed** and symptoms are severe or dangerous, using the lowest effective dose (typically 12.5–25 mg PO qHS) with close monitoring and a plan to taper within 4 months if effective [^111YgjJr] [^1113WtHS]. Nonpharmacologic interventions remain first-line, and risperidone or brexpiprazole are preferred if antipsychotics are necessary [^117HxWTY] [^1148tZwJ].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **Efficacy**: Evidence for quetiapine in dementia-related agitation is limited and mixed [^114DcgFB] [^114PoC9D]; some studies show no significant benefit over placebo [^1151LbYm], while others report modest improvements [^115yZEmg].

- **Safety**: Quetiapine carries significant risks in elderly dementia patients [^114DcgFB], including increased mortality [^115gZhha], cerebrovascular events [^113ZYVxF], sedation, orthostatic hypotension, falls [^112agWxM], metabolic disturbances, and cognitive worsening [^1151LbYm].

- **Guidelines**: Major guidelines (APA, AAFP, EAN) recommend antipsychotics only when symptoms are severe, dangerous, or cause significant distress [^111YgjJr], and after nonpharmacologic interventions have failed [^112kzRYg] [^117HxWTY].

---

## Recommended dosing and administration

- **Initial dose**: 12.5–25 mg PO at bedtime (qHS), titrated cautiously based on response and tolerability.

- **Maximum dose**: Generally not exceeding 100 mg/day in elderly dementia patients due to increased risk of adverse effects.

- **Duration**: Short-term use only, with regular reassessment [^116S73zn]. If effective, attempt tapering within 4 months [^1113WtHS]; discontinue if no response after 4 weeks [^117MKpYe].

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

Monitoring should include regular assessment for **sedation, orthostatic hypotension, falls, metabolic disturbances, cognitive decline, and extrapyramidal symptoms** [^113ZYVxF] [^112agWxM] [^1151LbYm]. Discontinuation is indicated if **no clinically significant response is observed after 4 weeks** [^117MKpYe] or if **significant adverse effects** occur [^1117pew8], with tapering to stop therapy [^116S73zn].

---

## Alternative pharmacological options

- **Risperidone**: Preferred first-line antipsychotic for severe agitation or psychosis in dementia, with stronger evidence of efficacy [^1154UF7V] [^117HxWTY].

- **Brexpiprazole**: Recently recommended for agitation in Alzheimer's disease [^1148tZwJ].

- **Citalopram**: Considered for moderate agitation or psychotic symptoms in Alzheimer's disease [^112jaRFX] [^112qA9Ty].

---

## Nonpharmacological interventions

Nonpharmacologic interventions are **first-line** [^112Tp5sw] [^111XXFqk], including environmental modifications (consistent routines, adequate lighting, minimizing noise and stimulation) [^117DZFDW] and behavioral strategies (caregiver education, structured activities, addressing unmet needs) [^114VAC6C]. Sleep hygiene measures include maintaining regular sleep–wake cycles, avoiding caffeine and other stimulants, and using evening relaxation techniques [^112Tp5sw].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Quetiapine fumarate PO is **not recommended for routine management** of dementia-related sundowning due to limited efficacy and significant risks [^116e5BYn]. Reserve its use for cases where nonpharmacologic interventions have failed and symptoms are severe or dangerous, employing the **lowest effective dose** with close monitoring and a plan to taper within 4 months if effective [^1113WtHS]. Nonpharmacologic interventions remain first-line, and risperidone or brexpiprazole are preferred if an antipsychotic is necessary [^117HxWTY] [^1148tZwJ].

### Behavioral disorders in dementia: Appropriate nondrug interventions and antipsychotic use [^117DZFDW]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia pose management challenges for caregivers and clinicians. First-line nonpharmacologic treatments include eliminating physical and emotional stressors, modifying the patient's environment, and establishing daily routines. Family members and caregivers benefit from education about dementia symptoms and reminders that the behaviors are normal and unintentional. Cognitive and emotion-oriented interventions, sensory stimulation interventions, behavior management techniques, and other psychosocial interventions are modestly effective.

In refractory cases, physicians may choose to prescribe off-label antipsychotics. Aripiprazole has the most consistent evidence of symptom improvement; however, this improvement is small. Olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone have inconsistent evidence of benefit. Physicians should use the smallest effective dose for the shortest possible duration to minimize adverse effects, most notably an increased mortality risk. Other adverse effects include anticholinergic and antidopaminergic effects, extrapyramidal symptoms, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, postural hypotension, metabolic syndrome, cardiac arrhythmia, and sedation.

Patients should be monitored for these effects while receiving treatment; however, laboratory monitoring may be limited to patients receiving long-term therapy.

### Treatment modifiers and predictors of risperidone response in dementia: An individual participant data meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials [^115TqoQp]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

Risperidone demonstrates modest effectiveness for treating psychosis, aggression, and anxiety in people with dementia, while showing limited impact on other symptoms. Treatment response may vary depending on individual pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic-related factors. Early improvement by week 2 appears to be a strong indicator of continued response at weeks 4 and 8. Future research should focus on developing tools to better balance the risks and benefits of antipsychotic use, ultimately supporting more personalized and effective treatment decisions.

### Does behavioral improvement with haloperidol or trazodone treatment depend on psychosis or mood symptoms in patients with dementia [^112jEBM3]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2001). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study focus on the effects of pharmacological interventions for agitated behavior in patients with dementia. Despite numerous studies, clinical practice often selects medication based on local pharmacotherapy culture rather than empirical treatment guidelines. This study examines the relationship between behavioral improvement and co-occurring delusions and mood symptoms in dementia patients treated with haloperidol, an antipsychotic medication, or trazodone, a serotonergic antidepressant.

- **Design**: Randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 9-week treatment trial.

- **Setting**: Inpatient geropsychiatry unit.

- **Participants**: Twenty-eight patients with dementia and agitated or aggressive behaviors.

- **Intervention**: Haloperidol 1 to 5 mg/day or trazodone 50 to 250 mg/day.

- **Measurements**: Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D), and delusional thoughts subscale and hallucinations subscale of the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD).

- **Results**: CMAI scores improved in each treatment group over the 9 weeks of treatment (P < .001 in each group). Within the haloperidol treatment group, CMAI improvement was not associated with baseline delusional thoughts score or with change in delusional thoughts score over the course of treatment. Within the trazodone treatment group, CMAI improvement was associated with baseline score on total Ham-D (r = -0.60, P = 0.02), and Ham-D items measuring subjective mood symptoms (r = -0.50, P = 0.07).

Should patients with dementia and agitation/aggressive behavior be treated with modern (atypical) antipsychotics compared to no pharmacological treatment?

- **Population**: Patients with dementia and agitation/aggressive behavior.
- **Intervention**: Treatment with aripiprazole, zotepine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, or clozapine.
- **Comparator**: No pharmacological treatment.
- **Outcome**:
	- Mortality (Important)
	- Agitation/Aggression (Critical)
	- Global cognitive function (Important)
	- Serious adverse events (Critical)
	- Caregiver burden (Important)

- **Summary of evidence**: A total of 4058 references were screened, and seven references were included [62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68]. Two references reported on different outcomes from the same study [65, 66]. All studies included were RCTs. Studies focused on risperidone (0.25 to 2 mg), quetiapine (25 to 200 mg), or olanzapine (2.5 to 15 mg). Meta-analysis was not performed due to heterogeneity in populations, length of interventions, and outcome measures. There were no differences in mortality between interventions and across studies [62, 64, 65, 67, 68] (relative risk point estimates 0.85–2.08; not significant) or serious adverse events [62, 63, 66, 67] (relative risk point estimates 0.89–1.9; not significant in all but one study [68]). However, there were, in general, very few events for the two outcomes, likely due to the relatively low number of patients and short length of included trials (6–36 weeks; four studies ≤ 12 weeks).

### The effect of quetiapine on psychosis and motor function in parkinsonian patients with and without dementia [^111HMHdf]. Movement Disorders (2002). Low credibility.

Recently, several small studies have indicated that quetiapine may be useful in treating drug-induced psychosis in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, questions have been raised regarding atypical antipsychotic therapy, patient selection, and how these factors may affect response and tolerability, particularly the worsening of motor symptoms in PD. The presence or absence of dementia seems to be important. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of quetiapine on psychosis and motor symptoms in PD patients with and without dementia.

A retrospective record review of patient responses to quetiapine was conducted. The response of psychosis was assessed through patient and caregiver interviews. Motor symptom changes related to this therapy were assessed by patient and caregiver interviews and the completion of the motor portion of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRSm). Analysis was performed by comparing psychosis and motor feature measures from before and after therapy for the group as a whole and for demented and nondemented subgroups, using nonparametric tests and Fisher's exact test.

Forty-three consecutively treated PD patients were evaluated. The mean dose of quetiapine was 54 mg per day, and the duration of therapy was 10 months. Eighty-one percent of patients demonstrated partial or complete amelioration of psychosis. Five patients (13%) experienced a worsening of PD motor symptoms, corroborated by changes seen in UPDRSm. When the group was examined as a whole, no significant change in UPDRSm score was noted. When demented (n = 20) and nondemented subgroups were analyzed separately, further insights were gained.

### Antipsychotics and dementia in Canada: A retrospective cross-sectional study of four health sectors [^112pZoEj]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Antipsychotic medications are not recommended for managing the symptoms of dementia, particularly among individuals with no behavioral or psychological symptoms. This study examines the use patterns of antipsychotic medication among persons with dementia across various health sectors in Canada, focusing on factors associated with use in individuals without behavioral or psychotic symptoms.

- **Methods**: Using a retrospective cross-sectional design, this research investigates antipsychotic use among adults aged 65 or older with dementia in home care (HC), complex continuing care (CCC), long-term care (LTC), and among alternate level care patients in acute hospitals (ALC). Clinical data from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2014, was used to estimate the prevalence of antipsychotic medication use based on the presence of behavioral and psychotic symptoms. Logistic regression identified sector-specific factors associated with antipsychotic use in the absence of behavioral and psychotic symptoms.

- **Results**: The total prevalence of antipsychotic use among older adults with dementia was 19% in HC, 42% in ALC, 35% in CCC, and 37% in LTC. For those with both behavioral and psychotic symptoms, prevalence ranged from 39% (HC) to 70% (ALC), and among those without symptoms, it ranged from 12% (HC) to 32% (ALC). The regression models identified several variables related to antipsychotic use in the absence of behavioral or psychotic symptoms, such as bipolar disorder (OR = 5.63 in CCC; OR = 5.52 in LTC), anxious complaints (OR = 1.54 in LTC to 2.01 in CCC), and wandering (OR = 1.83 in ALC).

- **Conclusions**: Potential associations were identified between certain conditions and the use of antipsychotic medication among individuals with dementia, highlighting the need for careful consideration of antipsychotic prescriptions in the absence of behavioral symptoms.

### Sensitivity to antipsychotic drugs in older adults [^112agWxM]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2010). Low credibility.

Antipsychotic medications are widely used to manage psychotic and behavioral disorders in older adults, including primary psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia and psychosis, as well as behavioral disturbances associated with dementia. These two broad diagnostic indications are associated with contrasting recommended treatment durations, with the former requiring indefinite treatment across the lifespan.

Antipsychotic drug dosing for schizophrenia is based primarily on studies of younger patients and thus may not apply to older adults. It is critically important to address the effects of aging on antipsychotic dosing given the recent emergence of data that suggest a critical role for age-related sensitivity to these drugs. Antipsychotic drugs are not only associated with somatic and neurological adverse effects but also increased all-cause mortality and sudden cardiac death in this vulnerable population.

This review focuses on the sensitivity of older adults to adverse effects from antipsychotic medications and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic explanatory models of susceptibility. Implications of recent research findings for individualized pharmacotherapy are discussed.

### Expert opinions on pharmacological symptomatic treatment of behavioral symptoms in frontotemporal dementia: A survey of the Neuropsychiatric International Consortium on Frontotemporal Dementia (NIC-FTD) [^115HFnqM]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Each suggested treatment option targeted one or more behavioral symptoms. A total of 118 out of 202 suggestions (58.4%), made collectively by our 48 respondents, most frequently mentioned disinhibition as a therapeutic target. Disinhibition was most frequently suggested to be treated with atypical antipsychotics (55/118, 46.6%). Specific medications suggested to treat disinhibition were quetiapine (24/118, 20.3%), risperidone (15/118, 12.7%), and trazodone (13/118, 11.0%).

Compulsive or perseverative behaviors were targeted by 94 out of 202 suggestions (46.5%), most frequently by SSRIs (44/94, 72.5%). Specific medications suggested to treat this symptom were sertraline (14/94, 14.9%), trazodone (13/94, 13.8%), and quetiapine, citalopram, or escitalopram (all 10/94, 10.6%).

Positive psychotic symptoms (PPSs) were targeted by 69 out of 202 suggested medications (34.2%), most frequently by atypical antipsychotics (60/69, 87.0%). Specific medications suggested to treat PPSs were quetiapine (22/69, 31.9%), risperidone (20/69, 29.0%), and olanzapine (13/69, 18.8%).

Apathy was targeted by 40 out of 202 suggestions (19.8%), most frequently by SSRIs (29/40, 72.5%). Specific medications suggested to treat apathy were sertraline (10/40, 25.0%), escitalopram (9/40, 22.5%), and venlafaxine (6/40, 15.0%).

Hyperorality was targeted by 32 out of 202 (15.8%) suggested medications, most frequently by SSRIs (15/32, 46.9%). Specific medications suggested to treat hyperorality were trazodone (9/32, 28.1%), sertraline (4/32, 12.5%), and escitalopram (4/32, 12.5%).

### Withdrawal versus continuation of long-term antipsychotic drug use for behavioural and psychological symptoms in older people with dementia [^1145kX8T]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Antipsychotic agents are often used to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in people with dementia, although there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of their long-term use for this indication and concern that they may cause harm, including higher mortality. When behavioural strategies have failed and treatment with antipsychotic drugs is instituted, regular attempts to withdraw them have been recommended in guidelines. Physicians, nurses, and families of older people with dementia may be reluctant to stop antipsychotics, fearing deterioration of NPS. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2013.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate whether withdrawal of antipsychotic agents is successful in older people with dementia and NPS in primary care or nursing home settings, to list the different strategies for withdrawal of antipsychotic agents in older participants with dementia and NPS, and to measure the effects of withdrawal of antipsychotic agents on participants' behavior and assess safety.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (ALOIS), the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, clinical trials registries, and grey literature sources up to 11 January 2018.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized, controlled trials comparing an antipsychotic withdrawal strategy to continuation of antipsychotics in people with dementia who had been treated with an antipsychotic drug for at least three months.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures.

### The American Psychiatric Association practice guideline on the use of antipsychotics to treat agitation or psychosis in patients with dementia [^114VRDJN]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2016). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of dementia, specifically related to the management of agitation, the APA 2016 guidelines recommend not using a long-acting injectable antipsychotic agent in patients with dementia with agitation or psychosis unless it is otherwise indicated for a co-occurring chronic psychotic disorder.

### Use of atypical antipsychotic drugs in patients with dementia [^114SEhkV]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Increasingly, atypical antipsychotic drugs are prescribed for elderly patients with symptoms of psychosis and behavioral disturbances. These symptoms often occur in patients with Alzheimer's disease, other dementias, or Parkinson's disease. As the average age of Americans increases, the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease will rise accordingly. Although nonpharmacologic treatments for behavioral disturbances should be tried first, medications often are needed to enable the patient to be adequately cared for.

Guidelines recommend using risperidone and olanzapine to treat psychosis in patients with Alzheimer's dementia. Quetiapine and clozapine are recommended for the treatment of psychosis in patients with Parkinson's disease. Additional research is needed for a recently approved agent, ziprasidone. To minimize side effects, these medications should be started at low dosages that are increased incrementally. Drug interactions, especially those involving the cytochrome P450 system, must be considered. Clozapine's potentially lethal side effects limit its use in the primary care setting. Informed use of atypical antipsychotic drugs allows family physicians to greatly improve the quality of life in elderly patients with dementia and behavioral disturbances.

### Efficacy of quetiapine for delirium prevention in hospitalized older medical patients: A randomized double-blind controlled trial [^1154hXnz]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Second, the dosage and administration of the intervention drug might influence the results. In this study, we administered only 12.5 mg of quetiapine once daily, which is the initial starting dosage for older patients. Those with strong significant precipitating factors, such as sepsis or deoxygenation, possibly needed a higher dosage of quetiapine to prevent delirium. Moreover, once-daily administration at bedtime may not be adequate treatment due to the short half-life of quetiapine, which is typically 6 hours.

In addition, unlike surgical or critically ill patient groups who have significant precipitating factors for delirium, our population had various medical conditions with different disease severities, which could affect delirium incidences. We did not assess or collect data about the severity of diseases, although our report on primary diagnoses showed quite similar results between the two groups. Previous comorbidities were also collected and showed no difference at baseline. In subgroup analyses, patients with longer hospitalization might have worse medical conditions; however, the results remained nonsignificant.

Finally, we did not have data on cognition. We did not collect data on cognitive testing at baseline because of unreliable interpretation in acutely ill patients. Those with previously diagnosed dementia were excluded at the beginning. Nevertheless, cognition had a great impact on delirium outcome. Older patients with cognitive impairment or dementia had a higher rate of delirium during hospital admission, which could possibly affect our outcomes.

### A European academy of neurology guideline on medical management issues in dementia [^111561ds]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

The authors conclude that there should be a weak recommendation for discontinuation in patients currently treated with antipsychotics. Discontinuation of antipsychotics may be considered in patients for whom there is no obvious indication and in patients in whom there is suspicion of side effects, such as rapid cognitive decline, sedation, falls, or extrapyramidal symptoms.

- **Justification for recommendations**: The identified studies did not show a significant positive or detrimental effect of discontinuation of antipsychotics. Observational studies have clearly demonstrated that treatment is associated with increased mortality in patients with dementia [53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59].

- **Supplemental considerations for treatment of agitation/aggression with antipsychotics in dementia**: We believe that treatment with antipsychotics may be relevant in selected patients with agitation and/or aggression. With the recommendations in this guideline, we wish to indicate that in those patients where antipsychotics are indicated, atypical antipsychotics will often be the first-line treatment. Most medical specialties may get involved in the decision to start or stop antipsychotic treatment. A detailed neuropsychiatric assessment, including medical and drug history, must be performed before initiating antipsychotic treatment.

In particular, factors such as infection, dehydration, pain, pulmonary or cardiac disease, environmental factors such as changes in living conditions, and other stressors should be identified and treated adequately by non-pharmacological approaches.

### Multiple intracerebral hemorrhages in an elderly patient after adding quetiapine to a stable warfarin regimen [^112ZmqWS]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

The efficacy of antipsychotics in patients with dementia exhibiting psychiatric symptoms has been overshadowed by safety concerns in recent years. Evidence suggests that the long-term use of antipsychotics in older adults is associated with a greater risk of cerebrovascular adverse events than accrues with short-term use (less than 30 days) [J Clin Psychiatry. 2010;71(6):689–98]. Here, we present an elderly male patient with dementia who developed multiple intracerebral hemorrhages (ICHs) 3 days after the addition of quetiapine to his stable warfarin regimen. To our knowledge, this is the second case of possible interaction between quetiapine and warfarin. We suggest mechanisms that may account for the patient's clinical presentation and highlight that combining treatment with quetiapine and warfarin may cause serious complications in patients with risk factors for ICH.

### Quetiapine oral solution in Alzheimer's disease: Efficacy and dosage insights from a real-world retrospective study [^116HJJSb]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). High credibility.

Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are distressing for patients with dementia, often accelerating functional decline and nursing home placement. Medications such as quetiapine are used to alleviate NPS, but their side effects require cautious use. Liquid formulations such as quetiapine oral suspension suit specific populations; however, real-world data on their use in patients with dementia are limited.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this retrospective, naturalistic study was to provide preliminary data on the effects of treatment with quetiapine oral suspension on behavioral and psychiatric disturbances in Alzheimer's disease (AD) outpatients in Taiwan.

- **Methods**: Between January 2022 and June 2023, data were collected from outpatients with a diagnosis of probable AD who received treatment with Qting® (quetiapine oral solution 25 mg/ml). Primary outcome measures were changes in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) total score and its sub-items from baseline to the endpoint.

- **Results**: We recruited 66 AD patients with a mean age of 72.1 ± 7.6 years, most of whom were female (69.7%). Twenty-three patients had data on neuropsychological tests and NPI scores before and after quetiapine treatment. There was no significant change in global cognitive function from baseline to the endpoint. A significant reduction in NPI total score after quetiapine treatment was noted, while the effect on NPI sub-items was limited. The average maintenance dose was 1.5 ± 0.6 ml.

- **Conclusions**: We demonstrated our clinical experience of the use of quetiapine oral solution in AD patients with NPS. Our result.

### Risk of death with atypical antipsychotic drug treatment for dementia: Meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials [^115gZhha]. JAMA (2005). Low credibility.

Atypical antipsychotic medications are widely used to treat delusions, aggression, and agitation in people with Alzheimer disease and other dementia; however, concerns have arisen about the increased risk for cerebrovascular adverse events, rapid cognitive decline, and mortality with their use.

- **Objective**: To assess the evidence for increased mortality from atypical antipsychotic drug treatment for people with dementia.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE (1966 to April 2005), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (2005, Issue 1), meetings presentations (1997–2004), and information from the sponsors were searched using the terms for atypical antipsychotic drugs (aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone), dementia, Alzheimer disease, and clinical trial.

- **Study selection**: Published and unpublished randomized placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trials of atypical antipsychotic drugs marketed in the United States to treat patients with Alzheimer disease or dementia were selected by consensus of the authors.

- **Data extraction**: Trials, baseline characteristics, outcomes, all-cause dropouts, and deaths were extracted by one reviewer; treatment exposure was obtained or estimated. Data were checked by a second reviewer.

- **Data synthesis**: Fifteen trials (9 unpublished), generally 10 to 12 weeks in duration, including 16 contrasts of atypical antipsychotic drugs with placebo met criteria (aripiprazole [n = 3], olanzapine [n = 5], quetiapine [n = 3], risperidone [n = 5]). A total of 3353 patients were randomized to study drug and 1757 were randomized to placebo.

### A European academy of neurology guideline on medical management issues in dementia [^1154UF7V]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

- **Summary of evidence**: Four references reported on the effect of atypical antipsychotics versus haloperidol (Figure S4 and Tables S13 and S17). Three studies were RCTs [69, 70, 71], and one was an RCT with a crossover design [72]. Three studies compared risperidone (0.25 to 2 mg) to haloperidol (0.25 to 3 mg), and one study compared it with olanzapine (2.5 to 7.5 mg). There were no events in studies reporting on mortality [69, 70, 72] or serious adverse events [71, 72]. Regarding agitation/aggression, two studies on risperidone reported that treatment with atypical antipsychotics improved scores [71, 72], while another two studies, one on risperidone and the other on olanzapine, reported the converse [69, 70]. However, none of the studies reported measures of variance (Tables S18 and S19). None of the studies reported on caregiver burden. One study did not include a financial statement [69], and two studies reported receiving funding from pharmaceutical companies [71, 72]. None of the studies included a conflicts of interest statement.

- **Level of evidence**: The level of evidence was graded as very low (Tables S18 and S19).

- **Recommendation**: The authors conclude that there should be a weak recommendation for the treatment of patients with dementia and agitation/aggressive behavior with modern (atypical) antipsychotics compared to haloperidol when pharmacological treatment of agitation/aggressive behavior is necessary. Among modern (atypical) antipsychotics, risperidone may be considered as first-line treatment when pharmacological treatment of agitation/aggression is required.

### Management of neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia in clinical settings: Recommendations from a multidisciplinary expert panel [^114VAC6C]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2014). Low credibility.

Noncognitive neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of dementia, including aggression, agitation, depression, anxiety, delusions, hallucinations, apathy, and disinhibition, affect individuals with dementia universally across various stages and etiologies. NPS are associated with poor outcomes for individuals with dementia and their caregivers, leading to excess morbidity and mortality, increased healthcare use, earlier nursing home placement, and heightened caregiver stress, depression, and employment difficulties.

Although the Food and Drug Administration has not approved pharmacotherapy for NPS, psychotropic medications are frequently used to manage these symptoms; however, in the few cases of proven pharmacological efficacy, significant risk of adverse effects may offset the benefits. There is evidence supporting the efficacy of nonpharmacological treatments, which typically have limited potential for adverse effects and are considered first-line. Despite this, their uptake as preferred treatments in real-world clinical settings remains inadequate.

Thus, the field currently faces a predicament in managing these challenging symptoms. It was within this context that the University of Michigan Program for Positive Aging, collaborating with the Johns Hopkins Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and Center for Innovative Care in Aging, sponsored and convened a multidisciplinary expert panel in Detroit, Michigan, in fall 2011. The panel had three objectives: to define critical elements of care for NPS in dementia, to construct an approach outlining the sequential and iterative steps for managing NPS in real-world clinical settings.

Regarding the medical management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, specifically in relation to antipsychotics, tapering, and discontinuation, the APA 2016 guidelines recommend tapering and discontinuing the antipsychotic in patients with dementia who exhibit agitation or psychosis if there is no clinically significant response following a 4-week trial of an adequate dose of an antipsychotic.

### Behavior disorders of dementia: Recognition and treatment [^116fJUqQ]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Psychosis may pose a greater challenge than cognitive decline for patients with dementia and their caregivers. The nature and frequency of psychotic symptoms vary over the course of the illness, but in most patients, these symptoms occur more often in the later stages of the disease. Management of psychosis requires a comprehensive nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approach, including an accurate assessment of symptoms, awareness of the environment in which they occur, and identification of precipitants and how they affect patients and their caregivers.

Nonpharmacologic interventions include counseling the caregiver about the nonintentional nature of the psychotic features and offering coping strategies. Approaches for the patient involve behavior modification, appropriate use of sensory intervention, environmental safety, and maintenance of routines, such as providing meals, exercise, and sleep on a consistent basis.

Pharmacologic treatments should be governed by a "start low, go slow" philosophy. A monosequential approach is recommended, in which a single agent is titrated until the targeted behavior is reduced, side effects become intolerable, or the maximal dosage is achieved. Atypical antipsychotics have the greatest effectiveness and are best tolerated. Second-line medications include typical antipsychotics for short-term therapy; and, less often, anticonvulsants, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, antidepressants, and anxiolytics.

Goals of treatment should include symptom reduction and preservation of quality of life.

### Economic outcomes associated with diagnosed behavioral symptoms among patients with dementia in the United States: a health care claims database analysis [^114yxYEd]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, no medication has been approved by the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration for managing behavioral symptoms in patients with dementia. In clinical practice, the symptoms are frequently managed with antipsychotics, antidepressants, and antiepileptics. Benzodiazepines are also over-utilized despite their demonstrated risk for harm and poor efficacy.

Real-world evidence regarding the economic burden of behavioral symptoms in patients is needed to estimate the value of novel treatments for patients with dementia. Claims data sources provide rich information on clinical and treatment-related characteristics, healthcare utilization, and costs. Few studies have examined the health care resource utilization (HCRU) and costs associated with behavioral symptoms, given the underdiagnosis and undertreatment of such symptoms among patients with dementia. Therefore, in this study, we leverage one of the largest sources of claims data to fill this gap in the literature. This study aims to characterize the prevalence of diagnosed behavioral symptoms among commercially insured older adults with dementia in the U.S. and to assess the association of these symptoms with HCRU and related costs.

### Antipsychotics and dementia in Canada: A retrospective cross-sectional study of four health sectors [^113VFk1T]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Antipsychotic medications are not recommended for the management of symptoms of dementia, particularly among persons with no behavioral or psychological symptoms. We examine patterns of antipsychotic medication use among persons with dementia across health sectors in Canada, focusing on factors related to use among those without behavioral or psychotic symptoms.

- **Methods**: Using a retrospective cross-sectional design, this study examines antipsychotic use among adults aged 65 or older with dementia in home care (HC), complex continuing care (CCC), long-term care (LTC), and among alternate level care patients in acute hospitals (ALC). Using clinical data from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2014, the prevalence of antipsychotic medication use was estimated by the presence of behavioral and psychotic symptoms. Logistic regression was used to identify sector-specific factors associated with antipsychotic use in the absence of behavioral and psychotic symptoms.

- **Results**: The total prevalence of antipsychotic use among older adults with dementia was 26% in HC, 54% in ALC, 41% in CCC, and 48% in LTC. This prevalence ranged from 38% (HC) to 73% (ALC) for those with both behavioral and psychotic symptoms and from 15% (HC) to 31% (ALC) among those with no symptoms. The regression models identified a number of variables related to antipsychotic use in the absence of behavior or psychotic symptoms, such as bipolar disorder (OR = 6.63 in CCC; OR = 5.52 in LTC), anxious complaints (OR = 1.54 in LTC to 2.01 in CCC), and wandering (OR = 1.83 in ALC).

### Sequential drug treatment algorithm for agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's and mixed dementia [^116AyhpX]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

At day 21, when a CGI-I score of three (minimal improvement) is recorded for risperidone and quetiapine only (decision squares shaded red), an extension of up to 21 days may be initiated, with a further "intermediate decision point" at day 28 or 29. For all other drugs, a score of three is considered an unsuccessful trial. For risperidone and quetiapine, after an extension, CGI-I scores of three or more at day 42 mean the trial has been unsuccessful, and the patient should be switched.

Clinicians should monitor for drug side effects as per their usual practice. Any pathway drug may be stopped at any time if it cannot be tolerated, moving to the next appropriate drug. The algorithm specifies that a third antipsychotic may be tried with whichever of aripiprazole or quetiapine was not initially selected in Step 2 if full trials of the first two antipsychotics could not be tolerated. The drugs outlined earlier as being included for PRN use, trazodone, and in certain circumstances, lorazepam, may be administered alongside the main pathway drugs where appropriate, using the same doses and regimens described for the clean-up phase.

- **Exiting the pathway**: At exit, all assessments undertaken at baseline, along with the CGI-I score (relative to baseline), should be repeated. The ECG and blood tests should also be repeated at or within five days of the time of exit.

### Use of quetiapine in elderly patients [^1164jMMg]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Behavioral problems associated with psychosis in the elderly have a significant negative impact on patients' quality of life and can lead to placement in a nursing home. Due to their decreased propensity to produce extrapyramidal symptoms, atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine hold promise in the treatment of these vulnerable patients. Quetiapine may, in theory, be particularly advantageous because of its lack of anticholinergic activity and its relatively loose binding to dopamine receptors. This article reviews the somewhat limited number of clinical studies on the use of quetiapine in treating older patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease or dementia with Lewy bodies, and patients with Parkinson's disease and drug-induced psychosis.

### Advances in management of neuropsychiatric syndromes in neurodegenerative diseases [^112XHLSM]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Low credibility.

There is limited evidence to support the use of typical antipsychotics to manage aggression and agitation in clinically acute settings. The efficacy of these agents is modest. Haloperidol is useful in the treatment of aggression with agitation (but not general agitation behaviors, such as wandering or verbal agitation). Typical antipsychotics are not recommended for the non-emergent treatment of agitation in dementia. Even in acute situations, the use of typical antipsychotics in neurodegenerative diseases carries risk.

Atypical antipsychotics have a lower risk of certain side effects, including parkinsonism, acute dystonic reactions, and tardive dyskinesia. Atypicals, including risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole, are alternatives for use in the management of severe agitation, aggression, and psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) where there is a risk of harm to the patient and/or others.

Risperidone has the best evidence for short-term efficacy (6–12 weeks) in patients with agitation. A meta-analysis of four large placebo-controlled clinical trials supported risperidone's efficacy in managing agitation and aggression even in severely impaired AD patients. In AD patients with psychosis or agitation who responded to risperidone therapy for 4–8 months, discontinuation of risperidone was associated with an increased risk of relapse. Risperidone may be considered an option for short-term intervention in cases of acute, treatment-resistant agitation in AD and may be useful in the long-term management of agitation where the agitation syndrome has become chronic.

### Validation of random forest machine learning models to predict dementia-related neuropsychiatric symptoms in real-world data [^1122Kib4]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Low credibility.

The plot showing the importance of variables for psychotic symptoms highlights the role of risperidone and quetiapine in their pharmacological treatment. It was expected that risperidone would contribute the most predictive value to the psychotic symptom model because it is the only drug with official approval from the European Drug Agency. A significant gap between recommendations and reality is evidenced by the role of quetiapine, which is the second most important medication, even though its indication for dementia is off-label.

Additionally, the level of sedation achieved by the medications used had a high explanatory capacity, and medication changes contributed considerably to the predictive value of the psychotic symptom model. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) affect almost all individuals with dementia (97%) over the course of the disease, and although they fluctuate, they rarely disappear. This makes the level of sedation particularly important. Families seldom have access to specialized clinics to deal with such fluctuations, and family caregivers often manage them by adjusting doses through trial and error. If that does not work, families turn to the most accessible doctor to change the prescribed drug because they cannot cope with the stress. This explains the importance in the model of the variables indicating the number of antipsychotic treatments and changes from antidepressant to antipsychotic drugs.

As described in the literature, antidepressant drugs also play a relevant role in managing agitation. Not only trazodone, but also sertraline, paroxetine, and mirtazapine are pertinent in this context.

### The American Psychiatric Association practice guideline on the use of antipsychotics to treat agitation or psychosis in patients with dementia [^113hWHC8]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2016). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, particularly concerning antipsychotics, the APA 2016 guidelines recommend discussing the possible tapering of the antipsychotic with the patient (if clinically feasible) and with the patient's surrogate decision-maker (if relevant), with input from family or others involved with the patient in case of a positive response to treatment. It's crucial to elicit their preferences and concerns, review the initial goals, observed benefits and side effects of antipsychotic treatment, and examine potential risks of continued exposure, as well as past experiences with antipsychotic medication trials and tapering attempts.

### Expert opinions on pharmacological symptomatic treatment of behavioral symptoms in frontotemporal dementia: A survey of the Neuropsychiatric International Consortium on Frontotemporal Dementia (NIC-FTD) [^113QqGWt]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Disinhibition was primarily targeted with atypical antipsychotics, such as quetiapine. This result is remarkable, as it is not recommended in the relevant literature. In comparison to a manic episode in bipolar disorder, this is mostly congruent with clinical practice in psychiatry.

Although suggested medications targeting compulsive/perseverative behaviors were somewhat heterogeneous, SSRIs were clearly the most selected, comprising about half of the recommendations. This result largely aligns with the relevant literature, which suggests the effectiveness of SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants. In comparison to similar symptoms in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), this approach is largely congruent with clinical practice, as OCD is primarily treated with SSRIs, aside from nonpharmacological treatments.

Psychopathological symptoms (PPSs), such as hallucinations and delusions, were treated homogeneously, with atypical antipsychotics selected in almost all of the respondents' suggestions. Although these symptoms are clinically burdensome, they are not discussed in the literature, making comparison difficult. However, this only strengthens the clinical relevance of these results. Compared to psychotic decompensation in schizophrenic disorder, this is congruent with clinical practice in psychiatry.

Suggestions targeting apathy consisted primarily of SSRIs and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). This is not congruent with the literature, which is heterogeneous but does not clearly suggest SSRIs or SNRIs.

### Deprescribing antipsychotics for behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia and insomnia: Evidence-based clinical practice guideline [^116SvTBJ]. Canadian Family Physician Medecin de Famille Canadien (2018). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, specifically with respect to antipsychotics, the CFPC 2018 guidelines recommend tapering and slowly discontinuing antipsychotics in collaboration with the patient and caregivers. This approach typically involves a 25–50% dose reduction every 1–2 weeks for adult patients with BPSD who have been treated for at least 3 months, provided that the symptoms have stabilized or there has been no response to an adequate trial.

### Nonpharmacologic management of behavioral symptoms in dementia [^112Tp5sw]. JAMA (2012). Low credibility.

Behavioral symptoms such as repetitive speech, wandering, and sleep disturbances are a core clinical feature of Alzheimer disease and related dementias. If untreated, these behaviors can accelerate disease progression, worsen functional decline and quality of life, cause significant caregiver distress, and result in earlier nursing home placement. Systematic screening for behavioral symptoms in dementia is an important prevention strategy that facilitates early treatment of behavioral symptoms by identifying underlying causes and tailoring a treatment plan.

First-line nonpharmacologic treatments are recommended because available pharmacologic treatments are only modestly effective, have notable risks, and do not effectively treat some of the behaviors that family members and caregivers find most distressing. Examples of nonpharmacologic treatments include the provision of caregiver education and support, training in problem-solving, and targeted therapy directed at the underlying causes for specific behaviors (e.g. implementing nighttime routines to address sleep disturbances). Based on an actual case, we characterize common behavioral symptoms and describe a strategy for selecting evidence-based nonpharmacologic dementia treatments. Nonpharmacologic management of behavioral symptoms in dementia can significantly improve quality of life and patient-caregiver satisfaction.

### A European academy of neurology guideline on medical management issues in dementia [^112vTV86]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

- **Summary of evidence**: Eight references [75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82] reporting on the effect of discontinuation of antipsychotics were identified (Figure S4 and Table S13 and S20) from a total of six studies. Three studies were single-center and three were multi-center RCTs. A number of references reported on the same two studies. Specifically, Devanand et al. [78, 79] reported on the same study, as was the case with Ballard et al. [81, 82]. In both instances, the studies reported on the same cohort, but outcomes relevant for the PICO were reported in two different studies, such as mortality in one study and neuropsychiatric symptoms in another.

A recent Cochrane meta-analysis [83] on the discontinuation of antipsychotics assessed three studies not included in the present guideline. One study did not report on any of the outcomes for the PICO [84], and two did not test a relevant intervention [85, 86] (i.e. did not test the intervention defined in the PICO; Table S13). An additional study, evaluated as satisfying the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria for the present guideline, was included here but had not been included in the previously published Cochrane review [82].

- **Study duration**: Ranged from 4 weeks to 12 months, with one study reporting a 42-month follow-up [82]. For studies reporting on mortality, the event rate was low. Point estimates for relative risk varied from 0.19 to 3.11, with most studies [75, 77, 78, 79, 80], but not all [82], showing no significant differences. One study reported on serious adverse events (relative risk).

### Quetiapine for psychosis in Parkinson's disease versus dementia with Lewy bodies [^112Re1DZ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Most clinicians perceive psychosis in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) as more difficult to treat than Parkinson's disease, yet there are no reports comparing the antipsychotic response between the two disorders. All charts of Parkinson's disease and DLB patients at our Movement Disorders Center, Memorial Hospital of Rhode Island, Pawtucket, who were given quetiapine for psychosis, were reviewed. Demographic data, including type and severity of psychosis, before and after Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)-motor scores, motor worsening, and treatment response (recorded as poor/none, partial, or total), were obtained. The chi-square test was used to assess differences in efficacy and tolerability of quetiapine between Parkinson's disease and DLB patients.

Eighty-seven Parkinson's disease and 11 DLB patients with psychosis were analyzed. No significant difference in mean age, levodopa dose, quetiapine dose, duration of quetiapine use, or baseline UPDRS-motor score was noted between Parkinson's disease and DLB patients. Eighty percent (70/87) of Parkinson's disease patients and 90% (10/11) of DLB patients had partial to complete resolution of psychosis using quetiapine (p = .40). Motor worsening was noted at one point in 32% (28/87) of Parkinson's disease and 27% (3/11) of DLB patients over the duration of quetiapine use (p = .74).

Long-term quetiapine use was generally well tolerated in this geriatric Parkinson's disease and DLB population. Mild motor worsening occurred in some patients. No significant difference in long-term efficacy or tolerability was observed between the two groups.

### Assessment and management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia [^115fpye1]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia include agitation, depression, apathy, repetitive questioning, psychosis, aggression, sleep problems, wandering, and a variety of inappropriate behaviors. These symptoms will affect nearly all people with dementia over the course of their illness. They are among the most complex, stressful, and costly aspects of care, leading to poor patient health outcomes, healthcare problems, and income loss for family caregivers. The causes include neurobiologically related disease factors, unmet needs, caregiver factors, environmental triggers, and interactions between individual, caregiver, and environmental factors.

The complexity of these symptoms means there is no "one size fits all solution", and approaches tailored to the patient and the caregiver are needed. Non-pharmacologic approaches should be used first-line, with several exceptions discussed. Non-pharmacologic approaches with the strongest evidence base involve family caregiver interventions. Regarding pharmacologic treatments, antipsychotics have the strongest evidence base, although the risk-benefit ratio is a concern. An approach to integrating non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments is described. Finally, the paradigm shift needed to fully institute tailored treatments for people and families dealing with these symptoms in the community is discussed.

### Psychosis as a treatment target in dementia: A roadmap for designing interventions [^112yrMfY]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Low credibility.

- **Pharmacological treatment**: The need for pharmacological interventions to treat all psychotic symptoms in dementia is a matter of debate. Currently, antipsychotic medications in patients with dementia are recommended only in cases in which there is substantial risk for harm to self or others, and after all non-pharmacological measures have failed. This approach is apparently justifiable in the case of minor hallucinations in PDD or DLB, to which patients are usually insightful and which rarely lead to patient suffering or behavioral changes. Nevertheless, early treatment of minor psychotic symptoms in PD has been suggested by some authors to attenuate psychiatric deterioration.

	- Despite the modest effect of pharmacological interventions and the increased risk for side effects, morbidity, and mortality, in practice, psychoactive medications are commonly used for the treatment of patients with dementia and psychosis, especially if clinical presentations are accompanied by additional behavioral disturbances such as agitation or aggression. For example, between 37.5–60% of patients with dementia in residential care facilities are usually prescribed antipsychotic medications, not only for genuine psychotic symptoms but also to control agitation, aggression, or severe sleep disturbances. Most notable is the use of typical (haloperidol, thioridazine) or atypical (risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, clozapine, ziprasidone) antipsychotics, with the latter being the preferred pharmacological treatment option.

### Seroquel [^1175oEd7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Quetiapine activity is primarily due to the parent drug. The multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of quetiapine are dose-proportional within the proposed clinical dose range, and quetiapine accumulation is predictable upon multiple dosing. Elimination of quetiapine is mainly via hepatic metabolism with a mean terminal half-life of about 6 hours within the proposed clinical dose range. Steady-state concentrations are expected to be achieved within two days of dosing. Quetiapine is unlikely to interfere with the metabolism of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes.

- **Pharmacokinetics in children and adolescents**: At steady state, the pharmacokinetics of the parent compound in children and adolescents (10–17 years of age) were similar to adults. However, when adjusted for dose and weight, AUC and Cmax of the parent compound were 41% and 39% lower, respectively, in children and adolescents than in adults. For the active metabolite, norquetiapine, AUC and Cmax were 45% and 31% higher, respectively, in children and adolescents than in adults. When adjusted for dose and weight, the pharmacokinetics of the metabolite, norquetiapine, was similar between children and adolescents and adults [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

- **Absorption**: Quetiapine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 1.5 hours. The tablet formulation is 100% bioavailable relative to the solution. The bioavailability of quetiapine is marginally affected by administration with food, with Cmax and AUC values increased by 25% and 15%, respectively.

### Efficacy and comparative effectiveness of atypical antipsychotic medications for off-label uses in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116F3g2v]. JAMA (2011). Low credibility.

Atypical antipsychotic medications are commonly used for off-label conditions such as agitation in dementia, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

- **Objective**: To perform a systematic review on the efficacy and safety of atypical antipsychotic medications for use in conditions lacking approval for labeling and marketing by the US Food and Drug Administration.

- **Data sources and study selection**: Relevant studies published in the English language were identified by searches of six databases: PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Cochrane DARE, and CENTRAL, from inception through May 2011. Controlled trials comparing an atypical antipsychotic medication (e.g. risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, asenapine, iloperidone, or paliperidone) with placebo, another atypical antipsychotic medication, or other pharmacotherapy for adult off-label conditions were included. Observational studies with sample sizes greater than 1000 patients were included to assess adverse events.

- **Data extraction**: Independent article review and study quality assessment were conducted by two investigators.

- **Data synthesis**: Of 12,228 citations identified, 162 contributed data to the efficacy review. Among 14 placebo-controlled trials of elderly patients with dementia, reporting a total global outcome score that includes symptoms such as psychosis, mood alterations, and aggression, small but statistically significant effect sizes ranging from 0.12 to 0.20 were observed for aripiprazole, olanzapine, and risperidone. For generalized anxiety disorder, a pooled analysis of three trials showed that quetiapine was effective.

Studies with quetiapine have provided mixed results. Ballard et al. found no treatment benefit in reducing agitation compared to placebo. Zhong et al. showed improvement of agitation in patients given 200 mg of quetiapine daily.

Olanzapine has been used for the treatment of psychosis in AD. It has anticholinergic effects and may decrease cognition while increasing the risk of anticholinergic delirium symptoms. Its use in the treatment of delusions and hallucinations in PD has resulted in exacerbation of parkinsonism.

Brexpiprazole, a novel compound structurally similar to aripiprazole (the mechanism of action includes reduced partial agonism for D2, 5HT1A receptors, and enhanced antagonism for 5-HT2A and α1-adrenoreceptors), is being tested for agitation associated with AD.

Data supporting the use of anticonvulsants/mood stabilizers are strongest for carbamazepine. Its use is limited by the risk of side effects such as dizziness, sedation, ataxia, and confusion, as well as more rare but significant adverse effects like the inappropriate antidiuretic hormone with hyponatremia, cardiac, and hepatotoxicity. Patients should be informed of the black box warnings for aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, and rare but sometimes fatal dermatologic adverse reactions.

The evidence for valproate as a treatment for agitation is mixed, with a meta-analysis of pooled results concluding that valproate is ineffective in reducing agitation in dementia and is associated with unacceptable rates of adverse events, notably sedation. There is a risk that valproate may worsen agitation compared to placebo.

### Psychosis as a treatment target in dementia: A roadmap for designing interventions [^115g9EZj]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Low credibility.

In Table 1, we summarize the most relevant evidence from clinical trials which examined the efficacy of atypical antipsychotic medications on ameliorating psychotic symptoms in patients with dementia.

- **Characteristics of the randomized controlled trials**: Table 1 examines the use of four major atypical antipsychotics: aripiprazole (Ari), olanzapine (Olz), risperidone (Ris), and quetiapine (Qtp). Abbreviations include BEHAVE-AD (Behavioral Symptoms in Alzheimer's Disease), BPRS (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale), CGI-I (Clinical Global Impression – Improvement scale), NPI (Neuropsychiatric Inventory–Questionnaire), and NPI-NH (Neuropsychiatric Inventory–Questionnaire Nursing Home version).

In 2005, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a black box warning regarding safety concerns associated with treating patients with dementia using atypical antipsychotic medications. The use of these medications in dementia is associated with an increased risk of side effects, namely cerebrovascular events, extrapyramidal symptoms, hypotension, sedation, anticholinergic effects, and mortality. These concerns resulted in a reduction in the use of these medications in dementia in the US, though reports on the extent of this decline are inconsistent. Atypical antipsychotic medications still comprised 9% of the drugs prescribed to patients with dementia in 2008. The use of typical antipsychotic medications in patients with dementia is associated with at least as much risk for morbidity and mortality as atypical antipsychotics, and the FDA has extended its warning to include haloperidol, one of the most widely used typical antipsychotics.

### Behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia: The role of atypical antipsychotics [^114oF9iT]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Although cognitive dysfunction is the hallmark of dementia, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), such as psychosis, aggression, sleep disturbance, agitation, and mood disorders, develop in most elderly patients at some stage. These symptoms pose major difficulties in the day-to-day care of patients and are likely to impair the quality of life of both patient and caregiver. Patients exhibiting BPSD should be assessed in a detailed clinical interview to establish symptoms causing distress to the patient and/or caregiver. Several mood and behavior scales with good psychometric properties are available for patient evaluation.

Initial intervention should focus on nonpharmacologic measures, and the quality of patient care should be optimized with potential physical, environmental, social, and psychiatric triggers being addressed where possible. Caregiver education, support, and behavioral training can also be effective in alleviating BPSD. However, pharmacologic intervention is necessary in many cases and includes the use of antidepressants for mood disorders, anticonvulsants for nonpsychotic agitation, and antipsychotics for aggression, agitation, and psychotic symptoms. Conventional antipsychotics have shown modest benefit over placebo in the treatment of psychosis and agitation in dementia patients; however, they are associated with treatment-emergent side effects, particularly extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine are at least as effective as conventional antipsychotics and are better tolerated.

### Scales to assess efficacy and safety of pharmacologic agents in the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia [^113Nd3rp]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Advances in the assessment of the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) have been employed in large-scale clinical trials of new antipsychotic medications, such as risperidone. These scales can be used to assess drug efficacy and to compare different treatment regimens. We review three valid and reliable scales: the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD), the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI).

Extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) associated with the treatment of BPSD have also been assessed using a number of rating instruments. The design of the most comprehensive of these, the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS), is exhaustive, successfully quantifying EPS and distinguishing toxic from nontoxic medications. This publication serves as an aid to researchers and clinicians in their interpretation of qualitative and quantitative data from trials evaluating antipsychotic agents in the treatment of BPSD.

Regarding medical management for dementia, with a specific focus on managing agitation, the APA 2016 guidelines recommend discussing the possible tapering of antipsychotics with the patient (if clinically feasible) and with the patient's surrogate decision-maker (if relevant). Input from family members or others involved with the patient should be considered, particularly in cases of a positive response to treatment. It is advised to elicit their preferences and concerns and to review the initial goals, observed benefits and side effects of antipsychotic treatment, potential risks of continued exposure to antipsychotics, and past experiences with antipsychotic medication trials and tapering attempts.

### Antipsychotics and dementia in Canada: A retrospective cross-sectional study of four health sectors [^11745wR3]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia are associated with functional decline and an elevated risk of institutionalization. A number of approaches have been recommended for managing such symptoms, including non-pharmacological interventions as well as low doses of risperidone administered over limited periods of time. However, there are concerns about the off-label use of antipsychotic medications, particularly use among older adults not experiencing behavioral or psychological symptoms. Off-label use of antipsychotic medications, depending on type and dose, is associated with an increased risk of falls, heart disease, pneumonia, diabetes, cognitive decline, and mortality among persons with dementia.

Government, industry, and professional recommendations generally do not support the use of antipsychotics in the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms, except in cases of psychosis and severe aggression. However, such recommendations and warnings have had minimal impact on patterns of antipsychotic use among older adults across a number of jurisdictions. Quality indicators of potentially inappropriate use of antipsychotic medications are routinely reported, particularly for nursing homes. Publicly reporting such indicators has been found to reduce the use of antipsychotic medications among older adults with dementia.

Patterns of antipsychotic medication use among persons with dementia are variable across care settings and jurisdictions. This issue is most commonly understood in the context of residential care settings rather than community settings.

### Quetiapine for agitation or psychosis in patients with dementia and parkinsonism [^1142hTpw]. Neurology (2007). High credibility.

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of quetiapine for agitation or psychosis in patients with dementia and parkinsonism, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel groups clinical trial was conducted. The trial involved 40 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (n = 23), Parkinson's disease (PD) with dementia (n = 9), or Alzheimer's disease with parkinsonian features (n = 8). The main outcome measure for efficacy was the change in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) from baseline to 10 weeks of therapy. For tolerability, it was the change in the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor section over the same period. The trial faced challenges due to the need for a design change and incomplete recruitment.

No significant differences were observed in the primary or secondary outcome measures of efficacy. An unexpectedly large placebo effect, inadequate dosage (mean 120 mg/day), and inadequate power may have contributed to the lack of demonstrable benefit. Quetiapine was generally well-tolerated and did not worsen parkinsonism but was associated with a trend toward a decline in a measure of daily functioning.

In conclusion, quetiapine was well-tolerated and did not worsen parkinsonism. Although conclusions regarding efficacy may be limited, the drug in the dosages used did not show demonstrable benefit for treating agitation or psychosis in patients with dementia and parkinsonism. These findings align with prior studies reporting limited efficacy of various medications for reducing behavioral problems in demented patients.

### Quetiapine and rivastigmine and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease: Randomised double blind placebo controlled trial [^1151LbYm]. BMJ (2005). High credibility.

To determine the respective efficacy of quetiapine and rivastigmine for agitation in people with dementia in institutional care and to evaluate these treatments with respect to change in cognitive performance, a randomised double blind (clinician, patient, outcomes assessor) placebo controlled trial was conducted. This study was set in care facilities in the north east of England with 93 patients with Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and clinically significant agitation participating.

The intervention involved administering an atypical antipsychotic (quetiapine), a cholinesterase inhibitor (rivastigmine), or a placebo (double dummy). The main outcome measures were agitation, assessed by the Cohen-Mansfield agitation inventory, and cognition, assessed using the severe impairment battery, both at baseline and at six weeks and 26 weeks. The primary outcome was the agitation inventory at six weeks.

Results showed that 31 patients were randomised to each treatment group, and 80 (86%) started treatment (25 with rivastigmine, 26 with quetiapine, 29 with placebo). Of these, 71 (89%) tolerated the maximum protocol dose (22 rivastigmine, 23 quetiapine, 26 placebo). Compared with placebo, neither treatment group showed significant differences in improvement on the agitation inventory either at six weeks or 26 weeks. Of the 56 patients who scored > 10 on the severe impairment battery at baseline, 46 (82%) were included in the analysis at the six-week follow-up (14 rivastigmine, 14 quetiapine, 18 placebo). For quetiapine, the change in severe impairment battery score from baseline was estimated as an average of -14.6 points (95% confidence interval -25.3 to -4.0) lower (that is, worse) than in the placebo group at six weeks.

### Evidence-based treatment and monitoring strategies for dementia-related psychosis [^112EXJKF]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

Atypical antipsychotics play a limited role in the management of dementia-related psychosis (DRP). Major adverse outcomes are associated with most antipsychotics in patients with dementia, and guidelines recommend that these drugs not be prescribed for long durations. When treating symptoms of DRP, clinicians should follow guidelines such as using medication only if the patient or others are in distress or danger and starting with low doses. Novel antipsychotics or alternative agents may offer superior efficacy and safety.

### A European Academy of Neurology guideline on medical management issues in dementia [^114DcgFB]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Aggression or agitation may occur during the course of the condition without obvious reasons or when patients with dementia experience stress, such as changes in the environment during hospitalization. It may also result from a physical condition or as side effects of drug treatment. A number of meta‐analyses have found that the efficacy of antipsychotics for treating agitation/aggression in patients with dementia is modest and is associated with increased mortality and risk of cerebrovascular accidents.

In 2007, European regulatory agencies and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued warnings regarding the use of atypical antipsychotics in patients with dementia. This warning was extended by the European Medicines Agency in 2008 and by the FDA in 2009 to include all antipsychotics. This decision was partly based on numerous large observational studies and meta‐analyses that showed increased mortality associated with treatment, which has been confirmed in subsequent studies.

However, antipsychotics may be used as first‐line pharmacological treatment in agitation/aggression under certain preconditions, particularly after all non‐pharmacological measures have been proven ineffective or in the case of severe self‐harm or harm to others. This includes the use of risperidone, haloperidol, and aripiprazole. Antipsychotics confer modest benefits for short‐term treatment of aggression/agitation in dementia, but these benefits have…

### Effectiveness of atypical antipsychotic drugs in patients with Alzheimer's disease [^114PoC9D]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic drugs are widely used to treat psychosis, aggression, and agitation in patients with Alzheimer's disease, but their benefits are uncertain, and concerns about safety have emerged. We assessed the effectiveness of atypical antipsychotic drugs in outpatients with Alzheimer's disease in this study.

- **Methods**: In this 42-site, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 421 outpatients with Alzheimer's disease and psychosis, aggression, or agitation were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine (mean dose, 5.5 mg per day), quetiapine (mean dose, 56.5 mg per day), risperidone (mean dose, 1.0 mg per day), or placebo. Doses were adjusted as needed, and patients were followed for up to 36 weeks. The main outcomes were the time from initial treatment to the discontinuation of treatment for any reason and the number of patients with at least minimal improvement on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) scale at 12 weeks.

- **Results**: There were no significant differences among treatments with regard to the time to the discontinuation of treatment for any reason: olanzapine (median, 8.1 weeks), quetiapine (median, 5.3 weeks), risperidone (median, 7.4 weeks), and placebo (median, 8.0 weeks) (P = 0.52). The median time to the discontinuation of treatment due to a lack of efficacy favored olanzapine (22.1 weeks) and risperidone (26.7 weeks) as compared with quetiapine (9.1 weeks) and placebo (9.0 weeks) (P = 0.002). The time to the discontinuation of treatment due to adverse events or intolerability favored placebo.
