## Question

How to treat Paryonchia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat paronychia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing acute versus chronic paronychia and identifying red flags. Then, I should verify when to drain and when antibiotics are actually indicated. Next, I will examine chronic paronychia management, including the role of antifungals and steroids. After that, I need to consider special populations and drug-induced cases. Finally, I will review prevention, follow-up, and when to escalate to surgery, making sure each step aligns with guideline-level sources and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework and classification, because treatment hinges on whether the process is acute or chronic and whether there is an abscess or systemic risk. Acute paronychia typically lasts less than 6 weeks and is often a bacterial infection after barrier disruption, whereas chronic paronychia persists beyond 6 weeks and reflects an irritant dermatitis with secondary colonization rather than true infection, so I need to keep that distinction front and center as I plan therapy [^1165Qx3J]. I should also screen for red flags such as immunocompromise, diabetes, lymphangitic streaking, rapidly progressive cellulitis, or systemic toxicity, since these shift management toward urgent drainage and systemic therapy rather than conservative care [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the need for cultures and imaging in uncomplicated cases. For routine superficial paronychia, cultures rarely change management and are not recommended, so I should avoid reflexively ordering swabs unless the presentation is atypical, severe, refractory, or in an immunocompromised host [^111XyN8H]. If I cannot clinically confirm an abscess or cellulitis, bedside ultrasound can help detect occult fluid collections and guide the need for drainage, which is a useful adjunct when the exam is equivocal [^111nXPoM].

> Next, I should review acute paronychia without abscess. Warm soaks several times daily with or without Burow's solution or dilute acetic acid are foundational to reduce edema and promote spontaneous drainage if a small collection is present, and I need to ensure the digit is kept clean and dry between soaks [^1165Qx3J]. I should confirm whether to add topical therapy: a topical antibiotic such as mupirocin or fusidic acid is reasonable, and adding a medium- to high-potency topical corticosteroid can reduce inflammation and speed symptom resolution, though I must balance this against any concern for infection and tailor to local resistance patterns [^1128NtSx]. Hold on, I should verify the role of oral antibiotics here; if there is no abscess and no spreading cellulitis, oral antibiotics are usually unnecessary, so I should avoid them in mild, localized cases to limit resistance and adverse effects [^115KUNmb].

> I will now examine acute paronychia with abscess, because this is where procedural management changes outcomes. If fluctuance is present, incision and drainage is mandatory; a simple longitudinal incision along the affected nail fold margin or a partial nail plate removal when the nail is embedded are appropriate, and I should avoid extending incisions beyond the distal interphalangeal joint to limit injury risk [^114QvE1R]. Let me reconsider antibiotics after drainage: if adequate drainage is achieved and the patient is immunocompetent, oral antibiotics are generally not needed; however, if there is surrounding cellulitis, immunocompromise, diabetes, or systemic signs, I should prescribe empiric oral therapy targeting Staphylococcus aureus, adjusting for local MRSA prevalence and narrowing if cultures return [^1113yMQi] [^1165Qx3J]. I should double-check that tetanus prophylaxis is updated when indicated, especially with puncture wounds or contaminated exposures [^114kxL9v].

> Now, for chronic paronychia, I need to ensure I am treating inflammation and barrier dysfunction rather than chasing infection. The cornerstone is irritant avoidance and barrier restoration: minimize water exposure, use protective gloves with cotton liners, avoid cuticle trimming and aggressive manicuring, and apply emollients frequently after handwashing, as these measures reduce recurrence and improve outcomes over weeks to months [^112EdFYR] [^111Kr6GP]. Pharmacologically, high-potency topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors are first-line to suppress inflammatory dermatitis; randomized data suggest topical steroids outperform systemic antifungals, reinforcing that Candida is often a colonizer rather than the primary driver [^1154BDx2]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost reflexively considered itraconazole; I should correct that impulse because antifungals are not recommended for routine chronic paronychia unless there is proven fungal infection or a specific indication like onychomycosis, so I will reserve antifungals for culture-proven cases rather than using them empirically [^113FqpoU] [^1158Kg1x].

> But wait, what if the chronic paronychia is refractory after 3 to 6 months of optimized medical therapy. In that scenario, I should consider surgical options such as eponychial marsupialization or en bloc excision of the proximal nail fold to remove fibrotic tissue and restore barrier anatomy; newer techniques like the square flap can reduce retraction and improve cosmesis, though evidence is limited and patient selection matters [^1124YTFC] [^11371u7S]. I need to ensure shared decision-making here, as surgery carries risks of nail dystrophy and recurrence if irritant exposures persist [^notfound].

> Next, I should review special populations and mimics so I do not miss atypical drivers. In children with finger-sucking or nail-biting, mixed oral flora including anaerobes are common, so I should broaden empiric coverage if infection is suspected and maintain a high index for herpetic whitlow when vesicles are present, avoiding incision in true HSV cases to prevent complications [^116k9JDc] [^112aKPrB]. In patients on EGFR or MEK inhibitors, paronychia is common and often sterile or colonized; management emphasizes topical steroids, antiseptic soaks, and procedural debulking of granulation tissue, with tetracyclines reserved for inflammatory modulation or superinfection rather than as routine antimicrobials [^1158Kg1x] [^117Hmim8]. Hold on, I should verify that antifungals are discouraged in drug-induced cases unless there is proven fungal infection, which aligns with consensus guidance [^1158Kg1x].

> I will now examine prevention and patient education, because recurrence is common without behavioral change. Patients should keep nails short, avoid cuticle trimming, use rubber gloves with cotton liners for wet work, moisturize after washing, and optimize glycemic control in diabetes; these measures meaningfully reduce recurrence and should be reinforced at every visit [^111Kr6GP] [^112EdFYR]. For patients starting EGFR or MEK inhibitors, preemptive nail care, antiseptic soaks, and early use of topical steroids can mitigate paronychia severity and preserve anticancer therapy, which is especially important given the high incidence and potential for dose interruption [^1158Kg1x] [^111iVpVV].

> Let me think about follow-up and when to escalate. I should reassess within 48 to 72 hours after drainage or initiation of therapy to ensure improvement; persistent pain, swelling, or granulation tissue warrants reconsideration of incomplete drainage, alternative diagnoses such as herpetic whitlow or retronychia, or the need for surgical consultation [^notfound]. If chronic paronychia fails to improve after 3 to 6 months of optimized medical therapy, I should refer for surgical evaluation and consider biopsy if atypical features raise concern for malignancy or inflammatory mimics [^1124YTFC] [^1144ueM7].

> Hold on, I should verify a few nuances that often cause confusion. First, ultrasound can help when an abscess is suspected but not obvious on exam, preventing delays in needed drainage [^111nXPoM]. Second, cultures are low-yield in uncomplicated cases and should be reserved for severe, atypical, or refractory presentations, or when drug-resistant organisms are suspected [^111XyN8H]. Third, in chronic disease, Candida colonization is common but eradication does not reliably correlate with cure, which is why antifungals are not first-line in the absence of proven infection [^1154BDx2]. Finally, in oncology patients, paronychia is frequently a toxicity rather than a primary infection; coordinating with oncology and using oncodermatology pathways helps maintain cancer therapy while controlling symptoms [^1158Kg1x] [^111iVpVV].

> In summary, I need to ensure my algorithm remains consistent with evidence: for acute paronychia without abscess, use warm soaks and topical therapy, avoiding oral antibiotics; for acute paronychia with abscess, perform incision and drainage and reserve oral antibiotics for cellulitis, immunocompromise, or systemic signs; for chronic paronychia, prioritize irritant avoidance and topical anti-inflammatory therapy, reserving surgery for refractory cases; and throughout, tailor to host factors, drug exposures, and local epidemiology while avoiding unnecessary cultures and antifungals [^113FqpoU] [^114b3AHg] [^1158Kg1x].

Paronychia is treated based on whether it is **acute or chronic** and whether an abscess is present. For acute paronychia with abscess, **incision and drainage** [^114QvE1R] is essential; after drainage, **oral antibiotics are not routinely needed** unless there is cellulitis, immunocompromise, or systemic illness [^1113yMQi] [^114b3AHg]. For acute paronychia without abscess, use warm soaks and topical antibiotics, adding topical corticosteroids if inflammation persists [^1128NtSx] [^1165Qx3J]. For chronic paronychia, **avoid irritants** [^112EdFYR] and use **topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors** [^1165Qx3J]; antifungals are not routinely recommended unless Candida is confirmed [^113FqpoU] [^1154BDx2]. Recurrent or severe cases may need surgical options such as nail avulsion or partial matricectomy [^116wiEqt] [^11371u7S]. Patient education on nail care and irritant avoidance is critical to prevent recurrence [^111Kr6GP].

## Acute paronychia

### Clinical features

Acute paronychia presents with **rapid onset** of erythema, swelling, and tenderness of the proximal or lateral nail folds, often following trauma or minor injury [^11371u7S]. Fluctuance indicates abscess formation [^notfound].

---

### Treatment

#### Abscess present (fluctuance)

Incision and drainage (I&D) is the **cornerstone of treatment** [^1165Qx3J]; techniques include a simple incision, double-incision, or the Swiss-roll method [^114QvE1R] [^115KUNmb]. Post-drainage care includes warm soaks (with or without Burow's solution or 1% acetic acid) two to three times daily for 2–3 days [^115KUNmb]. Oral antibiotics are not routinely needed after adequate drainage unless there is cellulitis, immunocompromise, or systemic illness [^1113yMQi] [^1165Qx3J].

---

#### No abscess (no fluctuance)

Warm soaks several times daily reduce inflammation and pain [^1165Qx3J]. Topical antibiotics (**mupirocin** or **fusidic acid**) may be applied twice daily for mild cases [^111MAUtD]. Topical **corticosteroids** can be added to topical antibiotics to reduce inflammation and hasten resolution [^1128NtSx].

---

## Chronic paronychia

### Clinical features

Chronic paronychia persists for **longer than six weeks** and is characterized by erythematous, swollen, and tender nail folds, often with nail dystrophy. It is typically associated with repeated exposure to irritants or moisture [^111Kr6GP].

---

### Treatment

#### Conservative management

- **Irritant avoidance**: Avoid prolonged water exposure, detergents, and trauma; use protective gloves with cotton liners [^112EdFYR].

- **Topical corticosteroids**: High-potency agents (e.g. betamethasone 0.05%) applied twice daily are first-line to reduce inflammation [^115MGsma].

- **Calcineurin inhibitors**: Tacrolimus 0.1% or pimecrolimus 1% are alternatives for steroid-sparing or refractory cases [^115KUNmb].

- **Antifungals**: Not routinely recommended unless Candida is confirmed; topical steroids are superior to systemic antifungals in randomized trials [^113FqpoU] [^1154BDx2].

---

#### Surgical management

Surgical options include **nail avulsion** — partial or complete removal of the nail plate for refractory cases with significant nail involvement [^116wiEqt] — and **partial matricectomy**, excision of the lateral nail matrix to prevent recurrence in chronic or recurrent cases [^116wiEqt]. For severe, refractory cases, en bloc excision of the proximal nail fold may be performed [^11371u7S].

---

## Special considerations

### Immunocompromised patients

Immunocompromised patients may require **broader-spectrum antibiotics** and closer follow-up due to higher risk of complications [^1165Qx3J].

---

### Drug-induced paronychia

Drug-induced paronychia (e.g. EGFR inhibitors) warrants **topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors** as first-line therapy; consider dose modification of the offending agent if severe [^1158Kg1x] [^112erph6].

---

### Pediatric patients

Pediatric patients generally receive **conservative management** with warm soaks and topical antibiotics; surgical intervention is reserved for refractory cases [^116q7pKW].

---

## Prevention and patient education

- **Nail care**: Keep nails short, avoid biting, and do not trim cuticles [^111Kr6GP].

- **Moisturization**: Apply emollients after handwashing to maintain skin barrier [^111Kr6GP].

- **Protection**: Use protective gloves for wet work and avoid irritants [^112EdFYR].

- **Glycemic control**: Optimize diabetes management to reduce recurrence risk [^111Kr6GP].

---

Paronychia management is **tailored to acuity and abscess presence**: drain acute abscesses, avoid unnecessary antibiotics, and prioritize anti-inflammatory therapy and irritant avoidance for chronic disease.

### Acute and chronic paronychia [^1144ueM7]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Paronychia is one of the most common infections of the hand. Clinically, paronychia presents as an acute or a chronic condition. It is a localized, superficial infection or abscess of the paronychial tissues of the hands or, less commonly, the feet. Any disruption of the seal between the proximal nail fold and the nail plate can cause acute infections of the eponychial space by providing a portal of entry for bacteria. Treatment options for acute paronychias include warm-water soaks, oral antibiotic therapy and surgical drainage. In cases of chronic paronychia, it is important that the patient avoid possible irritants. Treatment options include the use of topical antifungal agents and steroids, and surgical intervention. Patients with chronic paronychias that are unresponsive to therapy should be checked for unusual causes, such as malignancy.

### Can paronychia cause a remote necrotizing soft tissue infection? [^1171kDo4]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Remote necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI) resulting from paronychia is very unusual but potentially lethal. We report a case of a 39-year-old woman affected by this unusual infection. The paronychia completely resolved in less than 2 weeks, however, a NSTI involved the right chest and flank and the left thigh. The patient required intensive care and multiple surgical debridements. This recent experience and literature data suggest that paronychia can cause a remote NSTI that can rapidly spread and become life-threatening. Broad spectrum antibiotics and aggressive surgical debridement are essential to a successful outcome.

### Treatment of retronychia: a systematic review and suggested treatment algorithm [^1133R5N9]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Retronychia is an inflammatory disorder typical of the great toes characterized by arrested nail growth, ingrowth of the nail plate into the proximal nail fold and paronychia. There is no standardized treatment for retronychia, and its management should be weighed based on the severity stage, treatment modality, and clinical outcome. In this paper, a systematic review of the literature was performed to assess all published data regarding the treatment of retronychia. A total of 231 patients from 24 studies were included in the analysis. Conservative management was adopted in mild-intermediate forms, consisting of medical (topical or intralesional high-potency corticosteroids) and podiatric treatment (taping, clipping back the onycholytic plate, orthosis), leading to a global cure rate of 41.2%, with no reported side effects. Non-conservative management, that is, chemical or surgical avulsion of the nail plate, proved resolutive in 71.2% of cases. Surgical avulsion of the nail plate produced the highest cure rate (78.2%), but was burdened by 9.6% of long-term sequelae, mainly nail dystrophies. A decision-making algorithm was designed to give clinicians treatment indications based on the severity stage of retronychia, treatment invasiveness, and possible clinical outcomes.

### Acute and chronic paronychia of the hand [^117Fh9Au]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2014). Low credibility.

Acute and chronic infections and inflammation adjacent to the fingernail, or paronychia, are common. Paronychia typically develops following a breakdown in the barrier between the nail plate and the adjacent nail fold and is often caused by bacterial or fungal pathogens; however, noninfectious etiologies, such as chemical irritants, excessive moisture, systemic conditions, and medications, can cause nail changes. Abscesses associated with acute infections may spontaneously decompress or may require drainage and local wound care along with a short course of appropriate antibiotics. Chronic infections have a multifactorial etiology and can lead to nail changes, including thickening, ridging, and discoloration. Large, prospective studies are needed to identify the best treatment regimen for acute and chronic paronychia.

### Acute and chronic paronychia [^11371u7S]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Paronychia is an inflammation of the folds of tissue surrounding the nail of a toe or finger. Paronychia may be classified as either acute or chronic. The main factor associated with the development of acute paronychia is direct or indirect trauma to the cuticle or nail fold. This enables pathogens to inoculate the nail, resulting in infection. Treatment options for acute paronychia include warm compresses; topical antibiotics, with or without corticosteroids; oral antibiotics; or surgical incision and drainage for more severe cases. Chronic paronychia is a multifactorial inflammatory reaction of the proximal nail fold to irritants and allergens. The patient should avoid exposure to contact irritants; treatment of underlying inflammation and infection is recommended, using a combination of a broad-spectrum topical antifungal agent and a corticosteroid. Application of emollient lotions may be beneficial. Topical steroid creams are more effective than systemic antifungals in the treatment of chronic paronychia. In recalcitrant chronic paronychia, en bloc excision of the proximal nail fold is an option. Alternatively, an eponychial marsupialization, with or without nail removal, may be performed.

### Effective treatments for paronychia caused by oncology pharmacotherapy [^114h6uyu]. The Journal of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Cutaneous adverse events are relatively common in patients being treated with molecular-targeted drugs. Paronychia is one of the cutaneous adverse events that influences the patient's quality of life because of pain, and it often affects anticancer treatments in severe cases. However, there are few effective treatments, especially for severe paronychia. Here, we present our experiences of treatment for paronychia due to oncology pharmacotherapy. Although we treated paronychia with various methods, only corticosteroid ointment and phenol chemical matricectomy significantly improved the paronychia. Dermatologists must perform appropriate and effective treatments for paronychia in order to enable patients to continue anticancer drug treatment without impairing their quality of life.

### Acute and chronic paronychia [^1165Qx3J]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Paronychia is inflammation of the fingers or toes in one or more of the three nail folds. Acute paronychia is caused by polymicrobial infections after the protective nail barrier has been breached. Treatment consists of warm soaks with or without Burow solution or 1% acetic acid. Topical antibiotics should be used with or without topical steroids when simple soaks do not relieve the inflammation. The presence of an abscess should be determined, which mandates drainage. There are a variety of options for drainage, ranging from instrumentation with a hypodermic needle to a wide incision with a scalpel. Oral antibiotics are usually not needed if adequate drainage is achieved unless the patient is immunocompromised or a severe infection is present. Therapy is based on the most likely pathogens and local resistance patterns. Chronic paronychia is characterized by symptoms of at least six weeks' duration and represents an irritant dermatitis to the breached nail barrier. Common irritants include acids, alkalis, and other chemicals used by housekeepers, dishwashers, bartenders, florists, bakers, and swimmers. Treatment is aimed at stopping the source of irritation while treating the inflammation with topical steroids or calcineurin inhibitors. More aggressive techniques may be required to restore the protective nail barrier. Treatment may take weeks to months. Patient education is paramount to reduce the recurrence of acute and chronic paronychia.

### Management of finger felons and paronychia: a narrative review [^114QvE1R]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Finger felons and paronychias are common presentations to the emergency department with significant morbidity and long-term pain if not managed appropriately.

Objective

This narrative review provides a focused summary of the management of finger felons and paronychias for emergency clinicians.

Discussion

Finger felons consist of the accumulation of pus in the pulp space of the digit, which can lead to digital compartment syndrome if not adequately drained. Paronychias are an infection involving the proximal or lateral nail folds. Early felons and paronychia may be managed with antibiotics alone, whereas more advanced infections require incision and drainage. The preferred approaches for a felon drainage are a longitudinal incision in the volar space if superficial or lateral space if deep, with careful attention not to extend past the distal interphalangeal joint space. Extension to a hockey stick or fish mouth incision may be indicated in select cases. For paronychia, a simple incision approach is preferred for simple paronychia with abscess, while single or double incision technique along the nail is preferred for more complex cases.

Conclusion

It is essential for emergency physicians to be familiar with the management of finger felons and paronychias. We review the different approaches to management, with the goal of providing a resource for those interested in expanding their knowledge of felon and paronychia management.

### Acute and chronic paronychia [^111Kr6GP]. American Family Physician (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for paronychia, more specifically with respect to prevention of recurrent paronychia, AAFP 2017 guidelines recommend to advise the following measures to prevent recurrent paronychia:

- apply moisturizing lotion after hand washing

- avoid chronic prolonged exposure to contact irritants and moisture (including detergent and soap)

- avoid nail trauma, biting, picking, and manipulation, and finger sucking

- avoid trimming cuticles or using cuticle removers

- improve glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus

- keep affected areas clean and dry

- keep nails short

- provide adequate patient education

- use rubber gloves, preferably with inner cotton glove or cotton liners when exposed to moisture and/or irritants.

### Tips to treat the 5 most common nail disorders: brittle nails, onycholysis, paronychia, psoriasis, onychomycosis [^1156sdEM]. Dermatologic Clinics (2015). Low credibility.

Nail disorders are difficult to treat and often frustrating both for patients and clinicians. Because of the slow growth rate of the nail plate and the difficulty of getting the drug actives to penetrate the nail tissues, it is usually necessary to wait several months before seeing the results of treatments. This delay often leads to discontinuation of therapy by the patients. This article therefore helps clinicians to find the right treatment of the 5 most common nail disorders (brittle nails, onycholysis, paronychia, psoriasis, and onychomycosis) and provides practical tips that might improve patients' compliance.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of EGFR inhibitor-associated dermatologic toxicities [^116wQj8c]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (EGFRI) produce various dermatologic side effects in the majority of patients, and guidelines are crucial for the prevention and treatment of these untoward events. The purpose of this panel was to develop evidence-based recommendations for EGFRI-associated dermatologic toxicities.

Methods

A multinational, interdisciplinary panel of experts in supportive care in cancer reviewed pertinent studies using established criteria in order to develop first-generation recommendations for EGFRI-associated dermatologic toxicities.

Results

Prophylactic and reactive recommendations for papulopustular (acneiform) rash, hair changes, radiation dermatitis, pruritus, mucositis, xerosis/fissures, and paronychia are presented, as well as general dermatologic recommendations when possible.

Conclusion

Prevention and management of EGFRI-related dermatologic toxicities is critical to maintain patients' health-related quality of life and dose intensity of antineoplastic regimens. More rigorous investigation of these toxicities is warranted to improve preventive and treatment strategies.

### Chronic paronychia treatment: square flap technique [^1124YTFC]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic paronychia is an inflammatory process of the periungual folds that lasts longer than 6 weeks. It manifests as hypertrophy of the proximal and lateral nailfolds, absence of cuticle, progressive retraction of the proximal nailfold, and onychodystrophy. Surgical treatment is recommended if there has been insufficient response to 6 months of appropriate medical therapies.

Objective

We describe a new surgical technique that removes the fibrotic tissue without complete excision of the proximal and lateral nailfold, minimizing nailfold retraction and recovery time.

Methods

We present a case series of 34 fingers (9 patients) treated with this new technique.

Results

All nailfolds healed well without complications. At the end of the follow-up, all fingers, apart from 2, were relieved of the preoperative symptoms. The length of the ungual plate was maintained in all patients, with no retraction of the nailfolds.

Limitations

Follow-up period of 6 months and small sample size are limitations of this study.

Conclusion

This surgical technique can provide an alternative treatment for chronic paronychia, with good prognosis during follow up-period and optimal cosmetic results.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of EGFR inhibitor-associated dermatologic toxicities [^111VGCSL]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Medium credibility.

EGFR inhibitor-associated paronychia and periungual lesions — patients receiving epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors are at risk for nail changes that typically develop after two or more months of chemotherapy exposure, most commonly nail fold inflammation (paronychia) and periungual pyogenic granuloma-like lesions, with possible resultant onycholysis or onychodystrophy. Paronychia is characterized by tender, edematous, often purulent inflammation of the nail folds, affecting fingernails and toenails with the first digits most commonly affected; precedent trauma is not believed to be causative but rather an aggravating factor, and morbidity is high with significant pain, functional limitation, and impairment of activities of daily living; periungual pyogenic granulomata are characterized by friable vascular tissue overgrowths on lateral nail folds.

### Mitigation and management of adverse events associated with amivantamab therapy [^111Fs5x1]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Paronychia

Paronychia, an inflammatory process involving the soft tissues around the nail, was reported by 37%-68% of patients treated with amivantamab across pivotal trials; most reports were mild to moderate in severity, with the rate of grade ≥ 3 events ranging from 1%-11%. Paronychia was reported in 22%-35% of patients in osimertinib trials but was not reported as a common AE in trials of gefitinib, erlotinib, or afatinib. In the authors' experience, outside of clinical trials, paronychia is seen more frequently in patients on prolonged rather than shorter courses of EGFR inhibitors.

As with rash, paronychia generally occurs within the first 4 months of amivantamab treatment and decreases over time. In the MARIPOSA study, 50% of patients had their first occurrence of paronychia during the initial 4 months of treatment compared with 12% during months 5–8 and 3% during months 9–12.

Although not commonly severe, paronychia may be associated with complications, such as infections and bleeding at the nail beds, and chronic paronychia can be painful and debilitating, even at lower grade manifestations. In severe cases, periungual pyogenic granulomas can form around the nails. Painful cracks and skin fissures of the hands and feet have also been described. Other nail changes associated with EGFR inhibitors include mild onycholysis, brittle nails, and slower nail growth. Notably, MET inhibitor-associated peripheral edema can make the management of paronychia even more challenging; based on the authors' experience, patients with edema are at high risk of secondary infections in the setting of a chronic skin source of bacteria at the nail.

Other EGFR-related AEs

Other EGFR therapies are associated with AEs that have not been reported with amivantamab monotherapy, such as anemia, aminotransferase elevations, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia with gefitinib, and prolonged QT interval with osimertinib. When amivantamab is combined with additional drugs in combination regimens, other AEs, as discussed in the following section, may occur.

### Surgical intervention for paronychia induced by targeted anticancer therapies [^116wiEqt]. Dermatologic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Paronychia is a common toxicity associated with targeted anticancer therapies. Antibiotics and steroids are the standard treatments for severe paronychia, yet they are often inadequate, prolonging the patient's suffering and resulting in changes to effective cancer therapy.

Objective

This article describes the clinical course of drug-induced paronychia and attempts to identify circumstances under which nail surgery may be beneficial.

Materials and Methods

This is a retrospective case series from a single institution's electronic medical record for patients on paronychia-inducing anticancer therapies with nail disease visit diagnosis codes.

Results

The authors identified 36 nail procedures performed on 12 patients, all of whom were managed with conservative steroid and antibiotic therapy with varying degrees of improvement; however, no further improvement was seen after 90 days. Partial matricectomy, nail avulsion, debridement/clipping, and incision and drainage were performed with resolution rates of 100% (11/11), 38.5% (5/13), 12.5% (1/8), and 0% (0/4), respectively. The average time to surgical intervention was 196 days, and the average time to resolution was 268 days.

Conclusion

This series highlights the prolonged course of severe drug-induced paronychia and the importance of surgical intervention to reduce pain and impact on cancer treatment. Partial matricectomy should be considered for paronychia unresponsive to conservative therapy by 3 months.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of EGFR inhibitor-associated dermatologic toxicities [^117Hmim8]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Medium credibility.

EGFR inhibitor–associated paronychia — incidence and management: There are "no approved treatments for EGFRI-associated nail changes". Paronychia "is a sterile process, but it has the potential to become superinfected". In a retrospective study, "A retrospective study of 152 patients treated with cetuximab revealed 27 instances of paronychia (incidence of 17.7%)". Microbiologic evaluation reported, "A total of 42 culture swabs were performed in which all grew some organisms", with "coagulase-negative gram-positive bacteria (nosocomial colonization) was 31%, which was higher than the rate of S. aureus infection (23%)". Management aims to "minimiz[e] periunqual trauma, decreasing periunqual inflammation, preventing superinfection, and eliminating excessive granulation tissue", including that "Wearing comfortable shoes, trimming nails but avoiding aggressive manicuring, and wearing gloves while cleaning (e.g., household, dishes) are recommended to minimize periunqual trauma". Adjuncts include "Biotin has been found effective for the treatment of brittle nails in the general population", and therapies such as "Topical corticosteroid and anti-inflammatory dose tetracycline to decrease periunqual inflammation and antimicrobial soaks (e.g., dilute bleach in water; dilute white vinegar in water) to prevent superinfection are recommended", with procedures where needed: "Additionally, electrocautery, silver nitrate, and nail avulsion also are recommended to eliminate excessive granulation tissue".

### Hand infections [^111h8fiB]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Many acute hand and upper extremity infections should be treated as surgical emergencies to avoid stiffness, contracture, pain, and amputation. Proper treatment requires understanding of anatomy and how this influences the behavior of certain infections, common offending organisms, antibiotic treatment, management of host factors, and surgical intervention. This article reviews the microbiology, antibiotic coverage, and surgical treatment of the most common infections in the hand: paronychia, felon, herpetic whitlow, flexor tenosynovitis, deep space infections, septic arthritis, bites from humans and animals, necrotizing fasciitis, mycobacterium infections, and fungal infections. Recommendations are based on the most recent available evidence.

### Consensus recommendations on management of selumetinib-associated adverse events in pediatric patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 and plexiform neurofibromas [^112erph6]. Neuro-Oncology Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

5.000000000000000e+00 For CTCAE grade 3 paronychia, if multiple nails are affected, patients should seek consultation for expert podiatry or surgical management and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of selumetinib.

A few of the experts noted that some dermatologists may not be in favor of podiatry or surgical management and that topical or oral treatment may be sufficient for grade 3 (severe) paronychia. Dose reduction or discontinuation may also be considered if all treatment measures have been exhausted, or if symptoms of systemic infection appear (eg, fever, reduced general condition). Before restarting selumetinib, the panel recommends waiting at least 2 weeks and until the paronychia has healed.

Note that the selumetinib SmPC makes no specific recommendations on timelines for restarting the drug and such recommendations are based on the expert opinion of the panel.

6.000000000000000e+00 In the event of pus being present at the affected paronychia site, systemic antibiotics (tailored to the bacteria identified from a swab of the affected site) should be used in combination with a topical or systemic corticosteroid; corticosteroids should only be used as a standalone treatment once infection has been ruled out after collection of a sample from the affected site.

If the responsible bacteria cannot be identified, Staphylococcus can be targeted as it is the most likely to be involved. Systemic steroids are rarely used and there is a strong preference for topical steroids.

7.000000000000000e+00 To prevent further episodes of paronychia, the treating physician should consider referral to a specialist (eg, podiatrist, podologist, dermatologist, pediatric surgeon).

Referral to a specialist should be considered both to treat and prevent paronychia; however, this may be unnecessary for mild manifestations. Such referrals could be more strongly considered for prevention of paronychia if a patient has experienced previous episodes.

### Clinical and cytologic features of antibiotic-resistant acute paronychia [^112aKPrB]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute paronychia usually is treated as a bacterial infection, but antibiotic-resistant acute paronychia may be caused by other infectious and noninfectious problems.

Objective

We sought to describe the clinical, etiologic, cytologic, and therapeutic features of antibiotic-resistant acute paronychia.

Methods

A retrospective review of medical records and cytology was performed in 58 patients (age, 1 month-91 years; 36 children and adolescents [62%] and 22 adults [38%]) who had antibiotic-resistant acute paronychias.

Results

Causes of paronychia included bacteria (25 patients [43%]), viruses (21 patients [36%]), fungi (5 patients [9%]), drugs (3 patients [5%]), pemphigus vulgaris (3 patients [5%]), and trauma (1 patient [2%]). Diagnostic cytologic findings were noted in 54 patients (93%); no diagnostic cytologic findings were present with drug-induced (3 patients) or traumatic (1 patient) paronychia. The most common predisposing factors were the habits of finger- or thumb-sucking (14 patients [24%]) and nail-biting (11 patients [19%]). Complications included id reaction with erythema multiforme in 3 patients (5%).

Limitations

Limitations include retrospective study design from 1 treatment center.

Conclusion

Antibiotic-resistant acute paronychia may be infectious or noninfectious. Cytologic examination with Tzanck smear may be useful diagnostically and may prevent unnecessary use of antibiotics and surgical drainage.

### Hand infections [^1173qo81]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Hand infections are very common and must be properly diagnosed and treated to minimize the potentially devastating functional complications. Acute hand infections include felon, paronychia, deep-space infections, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, and necrotizing fasciitis. Chronic infections are usually caused by atypical mycobacteria and fungi. There are several conditions that mimic acute hand infections, and it is important to recognize them so that the appropriate treatment can be instilled. To prevent all these complications and poor outcome, prompt diagnosis and early institution of appropriate surgical management and antibiotic treatment are crucial.

### A study on the efficacy of ω toenail correction treating paronychia [^117TkY4a]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

To study the clinical effects of Ω toenail correction in the treatment of paronychia. One hundred thirty-six cases of 130 patients during the period from August 2018 to August 2021 were treated with Ω toenail correction according to clinical stages, the clinical therapeutic effects of which were evaluated in terms of the operation time, the time to resume movement, treatment cycle, 1-y recurrence rate, and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores before and after treatment. The clinical efficacy was analyzed and compared of Ω toenail correction in treating paronychia of different clinical stages. It has been demonstrated that there was no significant difference in operation time, time to resume movement, treatment cycle and recurrence rate among different stages of paronychia, while there existed the significant difference (p < .05) in VAS score of resting-state pain before and after correction which stood at 6.43 ± 0.29 points with the after-treatment VAS scores at 1.10 ± 0.22. There is a statistical difference (p < .05) in VAS score of movement-evoked pain between before and after treatment. The VAS scores of movement-evoked pain stood at 7.55 ± 0.42, which is in contrast with the after-treatment VAS at 1.74 ± 0.93. It has been concluded that Ω toenail correction characterized by easy operation can relieve the pain immediately, which can achieve satisfactory clinical efficacy for treating paronychia of different stages.

### INDIVIDUAL ARTICLE: USCOM IV algorithm for the prevention and management of targeted therapy-related cutaneous adverse events [^114w9HHu]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Targeted therapy has improved clinical outcomes for various types of cancer. However, their use is associated with dermatologic adverse events that impact quality of life and consistent therapies.

Objectives

The US Cutaneous Oncodermatology Management (USCOM) multidisciplinary-guided algorithm for preventing and managing cutaneous targeted therapy-related adverse events provides practical recommendations for cancer patients and survivors.

Methods

The USCOM advisory board (panel) identified 6 commonly occurring cutaneous adverse events associated with targeted therapies. Practical recommendations for prevention and management were developed based on the results of a literature search, clinical expertise, and opinion.

Results

Acneiform rash, pruritus, xerosis, paronychia, hyperpigmentation, and hand-foot skin reaction were selected as common targeted therapy-related cutaneous adverse events. The panel provides practical steps for preventing and treating these cutaneous conditions.

Conclusions

The USCOM multidisciplinary-guided algorithm is for healthcare providers treating oncology patients receiving targeted therapies. Cutaneous targeted therapy-related adverse events necessitate prompt and accurate diagnosis and multidisciplinary management that includes a dermatologist and the oncologic team, limiting disruption of cancer treatment and optimizing quality of life and treatment outcomes.

### Retronychia a little-known cause of paronychia: a report of two cases in adolescent patients [^116BqcYS]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Retronychia is a clinical condition resulting from embedding of the nail plate into the proximal nail fold. We report two adolescent girls, 14 and 16 years of age, with a history of chronic proximal paronychia of the great toe, one of them developing osteomyelitis. After failure of treatment with several systemic antibiotics, nail avulsion was performed, leading us to the diagnosis of retronychia and with rapid and complete resolution of symptoms in both cases. Delay in diagnosis of retronychia can lead to local complications and prolonged discomfort.

### INDIVIDUAL ARTICLE: NECOM 5: algorithm for the treatment and supportive management of targeted therapy-related cutaneous adverse events [^113K2fkg]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The cancer burden in the Nordic European countries remains substantial, but new treatment approaches, such as targeted therapy, have increased the survival of cancer patients. During and following cancer treatment regimens, however, patients' quality of life may be severely affected by sequelae, including cutaneous adverse events (cAEs). Overall, practical clinical tools for the management of cAEs in cancer patients and survivors have been lacking.

Methods

The Nordic European Cutaneous Oncodermatology Management (NECOM) project addresses cAEs in cancer patients, aiming to identify specific challenges and develop practical algorithms for their management. NECOM 1 and 2 provided an overview of cAEs and general recommendations for prevention and appropriate skin care regimens. NECOM 3 and 4 explored cAEs related to radiation therapy and immunotherapy, respectively. This NECOM 5 develops a practical algorithm for preventing and treating targeted therapy-related cAEs (TTcAEs).

Results

The NECOM panel discussed the findings of a systematic review of cAEs associated with targeted cancer therapy. The panel reached a consensus on a practical algorithm for TTcAEs, considering the current evidence, expert opinion, and clinical settings in the Nordic countries. The algorithm included general prevention and skin care recommendations, followed by specific advice for addressing the most common TTcAEs (papulopustular eruption, pruritus, hand-foot skin reaction, and paronychia).

Conclusions

Targeted therapy-related cAEs may negatively affect cancer patients and survivors. The NECOM panel provides a practical algorithm for preventing and managing TTcAEs to improve cancer patient outcomes and quality of life. J Drugs Dermatol. 2025;24:3(Suppl 2):s3–10.

### Retronychia: report of two cases [^114HNgaR]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Retronychia is an incomplete form of nail shedding that leads to embedding of the nail into the proximal nail fold and subsequent inflammation. Patients present with persistent paronychia in the setting of disrupted nail growth. Other nail changes may be present. Simple avulsion is curative, and unlike other forms of ingrown nails, it does not tend to recur. We report 2 cases of retronychia that were associated with distal onycholysis and subungual hematoma, respectively. Both were successfully treated with nail avulsion.

### Topical steroids versus systemic antifungals in the treatment of chronic paronychia: an open, randomized double-blind and double dummy study [^1154BDx2]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The involvement of Candida in the pathogenesis of chronic paronychia (CP) has never been proven, even though this condition is commonly considered a type of Candida onychomycosis.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of systemic antifungals (itraconazole or terbinafine) with a topical corticosteroid (methylprednisolone aceponate) in the treatment of patients with CP.

Methods

The study involved 45 adult patients with CP. Medication was given in a randomized, double-blind and double dummy manner over 3 weeks. Patients were then followed for 6 weeks. Clinical and mycologic evaluations were performed at baseline, and at weeks 3 and 9. The efficacy measures included clinical and photographic evaluation.

Results

Of 48 nails treated with methylprednisolone aceponate, 41 were improved or cured at the end of the follow-up period. The statistical analysis showed a significant difference between the number of nails improved or cured by methylprednisolone aceponate and that of nails improved or cured with terbinafine (30 out of 57) or itraconazole (29 out of 64). Presence of Candida was not strictly linked to disease activity, and Candida eradication was associated with clinical cure in only 2 of the 18 patients who carried Candida at the beginning of the study.

Conclusion

This study shows that topical steroids are more effective than systemic antifungals in the treatment of CP, and supports the view that CP is not a type of onychomycosis but a variety of hand dermatitis caused by environmental exposure.

### Bacterial and viral infections of the nail unit [^1153sJtE]. Dermatologic Clinics (2021). Medium credibility.

Bacterial and viral infections of the nail unit are very common as primary infections, especially bacterial paronychia and warts, but they can also be superinfections complicating other nail disorders. In many nail unit infections, the clinical presentation is nonspecific: in these cases, diagnostic tests are mandatory before treatment, to avoid spread of the infection and drug resistance. The most common forms of bacterial and viral infections that may affect the nail unit are herein described in detail, with diagnostic and treatment options provided.

### Consensus recommendations on management of selumetinib-associated adverse events in pediatric patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 and plexiform neurofibromas [^116q7pKW]. Neuro-Oncology Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Dermatologic Adverse Events

Dermatologic AEs potentially associated with selumetinib treatment include acneiform and maculopapular rash, pruritis (itchy skin), dry skin, paronychia, and eczematous rash; the most commonly reported are dry skin and acneiform rash. The psychological burden of these AEs can be high, with the potential to negatively impact treatment compliance if the patient's caregiver and physician decide to discontinue treatment. The burden of these AEs may also affect a patient's ability to perform daily activities, potentially leading to feelings of worry, frustration, and depression. Paronychia, defined as inflammation of the nail fold, has been indicated as a reason for treatment discontinuation or interruption and may be associated with pain and functional impairment; therefore, management must be considered. Eczematous rash causes inflammation and irritation of the skin, and studies have indicated that its severity is related to QoL. Acneiform rashes are characterized by erythematous papular and pustular lesions. Facial rashes are often a cause for discontinuation in adolescent patients, resulting from the social burden of this AE. Panel recommendations on the management of these and other dermatologic AEs are provided here.

Paronychia

To prevent paronychia, patients should try to prevent potential traumas to the hands and feet (eg, avoiding tight shoes) and be advised on nail management (eg, not cutting the nails too short, avoiding cutting close to the nail fold).

Other nail management tips include avoidance of biting or chewing nails, picking cuticles, scratching, manicuring, and finger sucking. Antiseptics may be used before cutting nails and the use of soap substitutes can be considered.

2. For all grades of paronychia, the affected nail should be softened with an antiseptic bath twice daily using recently opened antiseptic agents.

Nails should be soaked for 5–20 min once or twice daily in lukewarm or warm water. In the literature, softening of nails using antiseptic baths is noted as often being sufficient for the treatment of paronychia without pus. After soaking, nails should be rinsed and thoroughly dried. Such treatment can continue until recovery, but if no improvement is observed after 1 week, therapeutic escalation can be considered.

### A comparative study on the efficacy between omega toenail correction and winograd procedure for stage II-III paronychia [^116LZGX6]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The objective of this study is to conduct a prospective trial comparing the therapeutic efficacy of Omega toenail correction and the Winograd procedure in treating stage II-III paronychia. From August 2018 to August 2023, ninety cases from eighty-three patients were randomly divided into two groups, one receiving Omega toenail correction (experimental group) and the other receiving the Winograd procedure (control group). The clinical therapeutic effects of both treatments were evaluated based on time to resume movement, treatment cycle, one-year recurrence rate, and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores before and after treatment. The clinical efficacy was compared between Omega toenail correction and Winograd procedure treating paronychia of stage Ⅱ-Ⅲ. It has been demonstrated that the time to resume movement in the experimental group is obviously shorter than that in the control group (P = 0.024), while the treatment cycle is longer (P = 0.009) with no significant difference (P = 0.734) in the aspect of one-year recurrence rate. However, the VAS after the correction in the experimental group is significantly lower than that in the control group (P = 0.019). It has been suggested that Omega toenail correction characterized by easy operation, sure efficacy and lower recurrence rate can be widely applied in clinic work.

### Consensus recommendations on management of selumetinib-associated adverse events in pediatric patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 and plexiform neurofibromas [^112pS1cE]. Neuro-Oncology Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Although it is important to have recommendations on all AEs that can occur during selumetinib treatment, the panel agreed that particular focus should be given to AEs that, in their experience, have the highest frequency and/or patient impact. When discussing the prioritization of AEs, the panel experts agreed that physicians are typically concerned about high-impact AEs that may lead to discontinuation, whereas patients are likely most concerned about dermatologic AEs, which can affect their appearance and have a social impact. Therefore, it is important to consider these different perspectives when determining an approach to managing and preventing AEs. In the first part of this panel discussion, the experts agreed on the relative frequency and impact of AEs potentially associated with selumetinib. From this, consensus statements and expert recommendations were provided for priority AEs.

Dermatologic AEs with MEK inhibitors are well documented, and the panel agreed that, because of their frequency and impact on patients, these should be prioritized for selumetinib. The frequency of specific dermatologic AEs was noted to vary by age group, with acneiform rash more commonly seen in adolescents than young children. Of all dermatologic AEs, paronychia was seen as the most challenging to address, with the panel noting that it should be managed aggressively and be a key focus for healthcare practitioners. To prevent dermatologic AEs such as rashes or paronychia, patients should use emollients, practice sun safety, and prevent potential traumas to the hands or feet, for example by avoiding tight shoes. The psychological burden of AEs was also highlighted because it is high in most patients, can be worsened if there are underlying psychological issues, and has the potential to affect treatment compliance, especially in certain age groups.

### Nail toxicities induced by systemic anticancer treatments [^113NWd2p]. The Lancet: Oncology (2015). Medium credibility.

Patients treated with systemic anticancer drugs often show changes to their nails, which are usually well tolerated and disappear on cessation of treatment. However, some nail toxicities can cause pain and functional impairment and thus substantially affect a patient's quality of life, especially if they are given taxanes or EGFR inhibitors. These nail toxicities can affect both the nail plate and bed, and might present as melanonychia, leukonychia, onycholysis, onychomadesis, Beau's lines, or onychorrhexis, as frequently noted with conventional chemotherapies. Additionally, the periungual area (perionychium) of the nail might be affected by paronychia or pyogenic granuloma, especially in patients treated with drugs targeting EGFR or MEK. We review the nail changes induced by conventional chemotherapies and those associated with the use of targeted anticancer drugs and discuss preventive or curative options.

### Dermatologic adverse events associated with selective fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitors: overview, prevention, and management guidelines [^113PQWTU]. The Oncologist (2021). Medium credibility.

Nail Changes

Counseling and education on the potential for nail changes are essential before initiation of treatment with FGFR inhibitors. Preventive strategies include avoidance of prolonged contact with water, repeated trauma, friction, and pressure on nails and nail beds. The use of protective gloves and limiting use of nail polish removers and nail hardeners is also helpful. Patients are also advised to avoid biting nails or cutting nails too short and to use topical emollients and loose‐fitting socks and footwear. Preventive correction of nail curvature may be considered.

Paronychia

Recommended treatments for grade 1 paronychia include topical povidone iodine 2%–10% applied twice daily [58] or daily nail soaking in 1:1 vinegar:water for 15 minutes a day. Patients with grade 2 or 3 paronychia should be treated with a 14‐day course of oral antibiotics in addition to daily nail soaking in 1:1 vinegar:water; bacterial cultures should be obtained to confirm sensitivity to antimicrobial agents. Dermatology consultation is recommended for grade ≥ 2 paronychia, given the potential chronicity of this event.

Onycholysis

Recommended management options for onycholysis consist of trimming the raised distal nails, clipping of the nails, and application of topical povidone iodine 2%–10% b.i.d. solution [58] around and under the nails. Oral antibiotics should be started if infection is suspected (bacterial cultures and sensitivities should be obtained prior to initiating antibiotics), and nail avulsion may be needed if the patient has painful hematoma or subungual abscess.

Alopecia

Preventive measures normally considered for patients undergoing traditional chemotherapy regimens, for example, scalp compression, scalp cooling, and medications, are not applicable to patients receiving FGFR inhibitors, and the health care provider's attention should be focused on early identification and management of symptoms.

Management of alopecia consists of prophylactic or reactive topical minoxidil 5% applied once daily to the scalp to encourage hair regrowth, and a high‐potency topical corticosteroid (e.g. fluocinonide 0.05% solution). In addition, hair camouflaging methods, which create the appearance of naturally thicker, fuller hair, may be considered. Alopecia typically reverses when treatment is discontinued.

### Erlotinib-related skin toxicities: treatment strategies in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer [^113GPE7Z]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Skin toxicities are the most common side effects associated with the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor erlotinib, occurring in most patients receiving the drug. Clinical trials evaluating erlotinib for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer have reported a range of skin disorders, the most common being acneiform rash, xeroderma (dry skin), pruritus, and paronychia. Although in the majority of cases these effects are mild and transient, they can have a considerable impact on a patient's quality of life and, if particularly severe and persistent, may necessitate treatment interruption or cessation and compromise treatment outcome. This coupled with recent evidence to suggest a positive correlation between the incidence and severity of rash and clinical outcome among erlotinib-treated patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer highlights the importance of adequately managing epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor — related skin disorders. Clear treatment strategies are therefore necessary to ensure the prevention and optimal management of erlotinib-related skin toxicities thereby enabling patients to continue erlotinib treatment. In this review we present a practical approach for the treatment of erlotinib-related cutaneous side effects in Japanese patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer providing details of specific treatment interventions, according to symptom severity, for each of the common skin disorders. In addition, the importance of preventive skin care measures — namely maintaining cleanliness, moisturization, and protection from external stimuli — in preventing the development of serious skin disorders is discussed and guidelines for the practice of proper skin care are presented.

MASCC Skin Toxicity Study Group — methods and evidence grading: The Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) Skin Toxicity Study Group assembled an international, interdisciplinary group and formed topic review committees to develop guidelines for papulopustular (acneiform) rash, hair changes, radiation dermatitis, pruritus, mucositis, xerosis/fissures, and paronychia. Each review committee consisted of three members with a primary reviewer, and publications of the English-language literature as of November 2010 were included with each committee reviewing between 17 and 35 papers. Randomized clinical trials were considered the best source, recommendations incorporated Level of Evidence and Grade of Recommendation, and in the absence of experimental evidence, pertinent studies and case reports were presented with expert opinion; recommendations were developed based on panel consensus, with extrapolation from similar dermatologic conditions when available. Levels of evidence were defined as follows: Level I evidence is reserved for meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials or randomized trials with high power. Level II evidence includes randomized trials with lower power. Level III evidence includes nonrandomized trials, such as cohort or case-controlled series. Level IV evidence includes descriptive and case studies. Level V evidence includes case reports and clinical examples.

### Proximal nail fold swelling, pain, and granulation tissue [^1163VHcB]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 28-year-old man presented with a 4-month history of left great toe pain, swelling, erythema, and drainage. The patient was previously treated with a topical antifungal, oral antibiotics, and hot water soaks without improvement of symptoms. The patient's toe upon presentation is depicted in Fig 1 and after gentle washing in Fig 2. The patient's nail plate is depicted in Fig 3.

Question 1. What is the diagnosis?

A. Acute paronychia
B. Onychomycosis
C. Retronychia
D. Squamous cell carcinoma
E. Ingrown nail

Answers

A. Acute paronychia – Incorrect. Acute paronychia is caused by a disruption in the seal of the nail fold and nail plate allowing often polymicrobial infections to develop in the local periungual soft tissues.
B. Onychomycosis – Incorrect. While onychomycosis can cause proximal onycholysis, it typically does not cause periungual inflammation and drainage.
C. Retronychia – Correct. The diagnosis of retronychia is made clinically. Criteria for diagnosis are chronic inflammation of the proximal nail fold, granulation tissue protruding from under the proximal nail fold, and thickened often doubled proximal nail plate. Retronychia occurs when the nail plate separates completely from the matrix and a new plate grows under the old plate. This pushes the nail plate upwards and causes inflammation to the proximal nail fold.
D. Squamous cell carcinoma – Incorrect. Although the presentation of squamous cell carcinoma varies, it typically appears as a periungual friable, verrucous mass with associated nail dystrophy.
E. Ingrown nail – Incorrect. Ingrown nails occur along the medial or lateral border of the nail fold. This patient's symptoms occurred at the proximal nail fold.

### Nail toxicity associated with epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor therapy [^112hGMAx]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

As the use of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors becomes more widespread, increasing data are being collected regarding both efficacy and toxicity. Cutaneous toxicities are emerging not only as the most relevant class-related events, but also as potentially important markers of response to therapy. Although a follicular eruption is the most frequent cutaneous manifestation of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition, ingrown nails, paronychia, and xerosis and desquamation of the digits, all of which occur in a substantial number of patients, require attention from treating oncologists and dermatologists. These nail disorders are mostly mild to moderate in severity, but, if not properly managed, can result in significant pain and interfere with activities of daily living. Descriptions of the nail and periungual toxicities associated with epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor therapy and prevention and treatment strategies are presented.

### Is lymphangitic streaking associated with different pathogens? [^115MR3XB]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Little is known regarding the differences in microbiology associated with cellulitis or abscess with or without lymphangitic streaking. The objective of our study is to assess whether there are differences in the pathogens identified from wound cultures of patients with paronychia with and without associated lymphangitis.

Methods

Retrospective cross-sectional study at a tertiary pediatric emergency department over 25 years. We opted to assess patients with paronychia of the finger, assuming that these cases will have a greater variety of causative pathogens compared to other cases of cellulitis and soft tissue abscess that are associated with nail biting. Case identification was conducted using a computerized text-screening search that was refined by manual chart review. We included patients from 1 month to 20 years of age who underwent an incision and drainage (I&D) of a paronychia and had a culture obtained. The presence or absence of lymphangitis was determined from the clinical narrative in the medical record. We excluded patients treated with antibiotics prior to I&D as well as immune-compromised patients. We used descriptive statistics for prevalence and χ2 tests for categorical variables.

Results

Two hundred sixty-six patients met inclusion criteria. The median age was 9.7 years [IQR 4.7, 15.4] and 45.1% were female. Twenty-two patients (8.3%) had lymphangitic streaking associated with their paronychia. Patients with lymphangitis streaking were similar to those without lymphangitis in terms of age and sex (p = 0.52 and p = 0.82, respectively). Overall, the predominant bacteria was MSSA (40%) followed by MRSA (26%). No significant differences were found between the pathogens in the 22 patients with associated lymphangitis compared to the 244 patients without.

Conclusion

Staphylococcus aureus represent the majority of pathogens in paronychia, although streptococcal species and gram-negative bacteria were also common. Among patients with paronychia of the finger, there seems to be no association between pathogen type and presence of lymphangitic streaking.

### Neonatal acute paronychia [^116k9JDc]. Hand (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Paronychia is defined as infection afflicting the eponychial nail folds of the hand or foot. Such infections are rarely reported in the perinatal age group, and not previously described in a neonate younger than 2 weeks. Trauma resulting in inoculation of the nail fold is the most common predisposing factor to paronychia. Oral trauma in the pediatric population from finger sucking predisposes this population to a different set of bacterial pathogens than adults. Contamination can progress to infection and abscess formation within the nail fold with the most prevalent vector in adult infections being Staphylococcus aureus. Comparatively, mixed anaerobic and aerobic infections tend to afflict children with oral soothing habits.

Methods

This is a case report will present the rare occurrence of a paronychia in a neonate caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

Results

The management and treatment strategies for paronychia in this atypical neonatal patient consisted of incision and drainage and antibiotic therapy.

Conclusion

Neonates with oral self-soothing behaviors may be more at risk for developing paronychia of mixed anaerobic and aerobic infections. Initial therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics amoxicillin/clavulanate or clindamycin is suggested. Incision and drainage in the perinatal setting coupled with antibiotics is curative.

We report a case of refractory Fusarium paronychia in a 42-year-old man with Behçet's disease receiving oral cyclosporin and corticosteroid. Symptoms resembling candidal paronychia of his little finger could not be cured by topical ketoconazole and oral terbinafine. The pathogen was identified as Fusarium solani species complex by gene analysis, and was multiple drug resistant. The case eventually resolved by occlusive dressing therapy with 0.5% amorolfine cream for 3 months.

Grading systems for skin rash

Accurate grading of papulopustular rash associated with anti-EGFR therapy is essential to ensure timely and appropriate interventions. Currently, the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) is a widely used classification system in clinical trials. The most recent version (version 4.03) of this tool was published in June 2010. For example, severe skin rash (grade 3) is defined by papules and/or pustules covering ≥ 30% of the body surface area, limited self-care activities of daily living, or associated local superinfection (oral antibiotics indicated). Grade 2 skin rash is described to be "associated with psychosocial impact", but a validated tool to assess the degree of psychosocial impact is not part of the CTCAE. In addition, the CTCAE scale does not separately characterize the specific dermatologic toxicities observed with EGFR inhibitor therapy (xerosis, pruritus, paronychia, hair abnormalities, and mucositis).

In addition to the CTCAE, several alternative EGFR inhibitor- focused grading systems for dAEs have been proposed in recent years. Although several scaling systems exist, no studies have investigated how much these tools are actually used. In particular, it is not known how often current diagnosis of dAEs systematically includes assessment of restrictions in daily and social activities, emotional stress, and the need for dermatologic treatment.

Prevention and treatment strategies

Much of the literature about EGFR inhibitor-induced skin toxicities contains prevention and treatment recommendations. Based on the recommendations of the Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer Skin Toxicity Study Group, clear guidelines for prevention and treatment have been developed, e.g. for skin rash (prevention: hydrocortisone, minocycline; treatment: alclometasone, fluocinonide, clindamycin, doxycycline, minocycline, isotretinoin), radiation-induced dermatitis, pruritus, oral complications, xerosis and fissures, and paronychia. The clinical practice guidelines are summarized in detail elsewhere. However, no studies have investigated how often patients with cancer treated with EGFR inhibitors actually receive a preventive treatment, the criteria used to determine whether patients receive a preventive treatment, and how much dermatologists are involved in treatment recommendations.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of EGFR inhibitor-associated dermatologic toxicities [^112Tmyf3]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Medium credibility.

EGFR inhibitor–associated dermatologic toxicities — background and burden: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors (EGFRI) are used for treating lung, pancreatic, breast, head and neck, and colorectal cancers, and may be used as first-line through third-line treatments alone or in combination. Common dermatologic side effects include papulopustular (acneiform) rash, hair changes, radiation dermatitis enhancement, pruritus, mucositis, xerosis/fissures, and paronychia, with incidences ranging from 36% for mucositis to 80% for papulopustular (acneiform) rash. In cancer patients receiving systemic therapy, itchy skin or rash increase the number of visits to the outpatient clinic by 36% and 72%, respectively, underscoring the need to maximize supportive measures.

### Chronic paronychia in a hairdresser [^11188Sg6]. Occupational Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Chronic paronychia is a common occupational disease. It is multifactorial and affects a number of different groups of workers. However, the condition is not described as affecting hairdressers although hairdressing is associated with a range of other occupation-related hand conditions. We report an unusual case of chronic paronychia in a female hairdresser which occurred as a consequence of a hair shaft penetrating beneath the nail fold. Personal hygiene with thorough removal of any hairs that have penetrated the epidermis and wearing clean gloves can prevent the condition. We suggest that clinicians should be aware of the types of occupation and mechanisms involved in patients developing chronic paronychia.

### Topical brimonidine for pyogenic granuloma after paronychia surgery [^111Szh74]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Brimonidine, a highly selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist, is widely used for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The topical application of brimonidine gel may reduce facial erythema by inducing cutaneous vasoconstriction of rosacea. Brimonidine, with the characteristics of rapid metabolism and systemic clearance, has no significant affects on the heart rate and blood pressure. However, some medicines, such as tricyclic antidepressants or monoamine oxidase inhibitors, may influence brimonidine's metabolism.

The etiology of paronychia mainly includes an ingrown toenail, trauma, and infection. Surgery is an effective method to treat paronychia, but complications such as PG cannot be avoided, especially if postoperative infection occurs. PG is a disorder of benign vascular proliferation, with rapidly growing erythematous nodules developing into pedunculated tumors that may be subject to erosion and bleeding. The exact pathogenic mechanism is not fully clear and has been associated with trauma, infection, foreign body reactions, pregnancy, immunosuppression, several drugs, and delayed wound healing. The current available treatment options include topical or systemic pharmacotherapies, silver nitrate, surgical intervention, semi-invasive therapies, laser, and others. In terms of topical pharmacotherapies, beta blockers, such as timolol or propranolol, toll-like receptor 7 agonists, such as imiquimod, and other medicines are available. Overall, the relapse rate of PG is about 4.56%; surgical excision among the surgical management options is the most effective method, with a lower recurrence rate (2.94%) compared with nonsurgical treatments (3.67%), including cryotherapy, laser, liquid nitrogen refrigeration, and topical pharmacotherapies.

### Doxycycline prophylaxis in adolescent patients treated with MEK inhibitors [^115w1V79]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors (MEKi) are used to treat various conditions, including plexiform neurofibromas, brain tumors, and cancers. Our study aimed to determine whether doxycycline prophylaxis could reduce the frequency and/or severity of acneiform eruptions and paronychia, common side effects of MEKi. Our retrospective study included data from 43 patients aged 12 to 18years, who received MEKi treatment at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada, between 2010 and 2023. We found that while doxycycline prophylaxis did not significantly impact the frequency or severity of acneiform eruptions (based on CTCAE grading), it appeared to be associated with fewer MEKi discontinuations due to skin toxicities and decreased rates of paronychia.

### Amivantamab, the first epidermal growth factor receptor and mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor inhibitor, associated with penile and inguinal ulcers and paronychia [^115JtpAF]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The EGFR protein is essential to maintain epidermal homeostasis. When its function is disrupted, it can adversely affect the skin. PRIDE complex refers to the classic cutaneous side effects observed with EGFR inhibitors, including papulopustular rash, paronychia, hair growth abnormalities, itching, and dryness. Amivantamab is the first EGFR and MET inhibitor target therapy for locally advanced or metastatic non–small cell lung cancer with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. In the CHRYSALIS phase 1 clinical trial, cutaneous lesions were the most common adverse reaction. Skin lesions were consistent with those seen with other EGFR inhibitors, including acneiform eruptions, paronychia, and stomatitis.

Conversely, the toxicity profile associated with MET inhibition is unrelated to the skin, including lower extremity edema, gastrointestinal distress, fatigue, and transaminitis, none of which were observed in our patient.

The abrupt onset of lesions and temporal resolution following drug initiation and withdrawal, and concomitant paronychia and dryness commonly observed with EGFR inhibitors, support the diagnosis of EGFR inhibitor cutaneous toxicity. The EGFR is present in basal epidermal keratinocytes, and studies have shown that inhibition of this receptor induces cell cycle growth arrest and terminal differentiation. Skin changes such as epidermal atrophy, hyperplasia, and abnormal differentiation observed in various skin diseases may be mediated through disruption of the EGFR signaling cascade. Histologic changes during therapy include thinning of the corneal layer and granular layer, vacuolar degeneration of the basal layer, and apoptotic keratinocytes. These molecular and histologic changes may result in skin necrosis and ulceration, as seen in our patient.

Although the patient did not exhibit all of the adverse events enclosed within the PRIDE complex, he experienced 3, including dry mouth, cracked lips, and paronychia. To our knowledge, a single case of skin ulcers appearing after initiating an EGFR inhibitor has been reported. The patient developed an ulcer on the palm of the hand 2 weeks after initiating therapy with gefitinib, another commonly used EGFR inhibitor for lung cancer. Therapy was interrupted for 2 weeks, and the patient was treated with topical steroids and antibiotics, with resolution of the ulcer. Our patient responded inadequately to topical steroids while on treatment with amivantamab. However, after discontinuing amivantamab, the lesions responded positively with re-epithelialization.

### Consensus recommendations on management of selumetinib-associated adverse events in pediatric patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 and plexiform neurofibromas [^113FdXTA]. Neuro-Oncology Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

3.000000000000000e+00 Infection should be managed with an antiseptic with or without a topical antibiotic, according to local practice.

The dosage and duration of treatment depend on the specific topical antibiotic used. In general, the use of a topical antibiotic 2–3 times daily is recommended, although this may depend on severity and tolerance. Topical antibiotics may only be used for mild infections and there is some disagreement on the use of occlusion with the topical antibiotic. If possible, the choice of topical antibiotic should be tailored to the bacteria identified from a swab of the affected site. A combined preparation of a steroid and topical antibiotic could be considered to manage the chronic inflammatory reaction seen with MEK inhibition. If there is evidence of a fungal infection, a topical antifungal could be used in combination with a topical antibiotic. When selecting a systemic antifungal, fluconazole (a strong cytochrome P450 2 C19 [CYP2C19]/moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) or itraconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) should be avoided due to their potential to increase the maximum plasma concentration of selumetinib.

4.000000000000000e+00 For CTCAE grade 2 paronychia, patients should use a high-potency steroid (topical) once infection is ruled out after collection of a sample from the affected site. A systemic antibiotic is recommended in case of infection. If such management is not successful, dose reduction then discontinuation of selumetinib should be considered.

If just 1 finger or toe is involved, this may not warrant the use of systemic antibiotics, and treatment should be left to the physician's best practices and judgment. Occlusive bandages could be used alongside topical steroids; for this, fludroxycortide tape for chronic non-infected paronychia was recommended, as it provides the dual effect of topical steroid application and absorption and occlusion. The specific choice of antibiotic should be guided by swab results, if available.

Nail Toxicities

Nail Toxicities of Targeted Therapies

Targeted therapies may cause damage to nail folds, with paronychia and periungual pyogenic granuloma distinct from chemotherapy-induced lesions (Fig. 4 a, b) that are mostly observed in the nail plate or the nail matrix. As some patients may receive both treatment types combined, clinicians must be fully informed of differences between chemotherapy and targeted therapy-associated nail toxicities. Paronychia and periungual granulomas are mostly reported in response to EGFRIs, with a 17.2% all-grade toxicity incidence, as well as MEKIs and mTOR inhibitors to a lesser extent. Typical lesions, which mostly affect toenails or thumbs, develop slowly after several weeks or months of treatment. Damage typically starts with the development of periungual inflammatory paronychia and can evolve into overgrowing of friable granulation tissue on lateral and/or proximal nail folds, mimicking ingrown nails. Although usually not severe, such lesions can still be very debilitating for the patient, especially when they persist for a long time. Therefore, aggressive strategies must be implemented to help patients cope with these adverse effects. The standard of care for pyogenic granuloma is surgery with partial removal of the nail plate and matrix and physical destruction of the granulation tissue and phenolization. In patients with multiple concomitant lesions, conservative treatment should be prioritized, with supportive oncodermatology while maintaining targeted therapy. In close collaboration with a podiatrist, nail curvature can be corrected if needed. Stretchable tape, liquid nitrogen, a combination of topical corticosteroids and antibiotics, antiseptic soaks, and silver nitrate can also be used. Topical timolol can also be helpful for periungual pyogenic granuloma.

### Topical brimonidine for pyogenic granuloma after paronychia surgery [^114AAUGx]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 17-year-old boy presented with suppuration of the first toe of both feet and excruciating pain (Fig 1, A). We performed surgical treatment of a partial nail avulsion and lateral nail fold excision as the clinical manifestations were consistent with those of paronychia of the nail embedment (Fig 1, B); the lateral horns of the nail matrix were also excised.

Fig 1

C, Gradual formation of PG within 22 days after the surgery. D, Postmedical outcome after 15 days of the treatment with topical brimonidine. PG, Pyogenic granuloma.

On the 7th day after the surgery, the operation site of the first toe of the left foot developed pain and slight pyosis. The suture was removed on the 14th day as planned, but erythematous nodules and an erosive surface gradually appeared in the next following 8 days, consistent with the lesions of PG (Fig 1, C).

Due to the fear of pain during local anesthesia and post the surgery and risk of recurrence, he refused all invasive treatments. Considering the infected condition of this therefore we treated him using a conservative approach. He was treated with wet compression of 0.2% topical brimonidine tartrate eye drops twice daily after the lesion was disinfected with povidone iodine. After several days of the 0.2% topical brimonidine tartrate eye drop treatment, the pain was significantly relieved, with visible improvement. Fifteen days after the effective treatment, the skin lesions of PG improved (Fig 1, D), with no perceived side effects, such as drowsiness, hypotension, or bradycardia.

### Common acute hand infections [^114kxL9v]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Hand infections can result in significant morbidity if not appropriately diagnosed and treated. Host factors, location, and circumstances of the infection are important guides to initial treatment strategies. Many hand infections improve with early splinting, elevation, appropriate antibiotics and, if an abscess is present, incision and drainage. Tetanus prophylaxis is indicated in patients who have at-risk infections. Paronychia, an infection of the epidermis bordering the nail, commonly is precipitated by localized trauma. Treatment consists of incision and drainage, warm-water soaks and, sometimes, oral antibiotics. A felon is an abscess of the distal pulp of the fingertip. An early felon may be amenable to elevation, oral antibiotics, and warm water or saline soaks. A more advanced felon requires incision and drainage. Herpetic whitlow is a painful infection caused by the herpes simplex virus. Early treatment with oral antiviral agents may hasten healing. Pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis and clenched-fist injuries are more serious infections that often require surgical intervention. Pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis is an acute synovial space infection involving a flexor tendon sheath. Treatment consists of parenteral antibiotics and sheath irrigation. A clenched-fist injury usually is the result of an altercation and often involves injury to the extensor tendon, joint capsule, and bone. Wound exploration, copious irrigation, and appropriate antibiotics can prevent undesired outcomes.

### Causes and management of acute oncological pain: a narrative review [^112csVkp]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment‐related pain: chemotherapy

Systemic anticancer treatment, namely chemotherapy, is classically associated with chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy, a chronic, cumulative sensory neuropathy which develops over the course of chemotherapy. Some chemotherapy drugs can be associated with more acute pain. Oxaliplatin, a platinum analogue used widely in gastrointestinal cancers, is associated with an unpleasant acute cold‐sensitive neuropathy affecting the hands, feet and oropharynx in 80–90% of patients. This can arise within hours of receiving oxaliplatin and may last up to 72 h. The underlying mechanism is thought to relate to oxaliplatin modulating the transcription of distinct ion channels that shape sensory neuronal cold responses. The presence of this phenomenon is a marker for the development of more severe longer‐term chemotherapy‐induced peripheral neuropathy.

Due to the rapid turnover of the cells of the nail matrix, toe and fingernails are particularly vulnerable to damage from chemotherapy. Certain nail toxicities may be acutely painful. Onycholysis, the separation of the nail plate from the nail bed, is associated with taxane‐based chemotherapy and, when haemorrhagic, can cause severe pain. Other painful nail toxicities include subungual haematomas and paronychia. Specialist dermatological input to assist with the management of patients presenting with painful nail toxicity is advised.

### Afatinib (Gilotrif) [^111HrSkH]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Dose reductions due to adverse reactions were required in 57% of GILOTRIF-treated patients. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to dose reduction in the patients treated with GILOTRIF were diarrhea (20%), rash/acne (19%), paronychia (14%), and stomatitis (10%). Discontinuation of therapy in GILOTRIF-treated patients for adverse reactions was 14.0%. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation in GILOTRIF-treated patients were diarrhea (1.3%), ILD (0.9%), and paronychia (0.9%).

Clinical trials of GILOTRIF excluded patients with an abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), i.e., below the institutional lower limit of normal. In LUX-Lung 3, all patients were evaluated for LVEF at screening and every 9 weeks thereafter in the GILOTRIF-treated group and as needed in the pemetrexed/cisplatin group. More GILOTRIF-treated patients (2.2%; n = 5) experienced ventricular dysfunction (defined as diastolic dysfunction, left ventricular dysfunction, or ventricular dilation; all < Grade 3) compared to chemotherapy-treated patients (0.9%; n = 1).

Tables 1 and 2 summarize common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities in LUX-Lung 3.

Other clinically important adverse reactions observed in patients treated with GILOTRIF but that occurred at a higher incidence in pemetrexed/cisplatin-treated patients and not listed elsewhere in section 6 include: decreased appetite (29% Grades 1–4, 4% Grade 3), nausea (25% Grades 1–4, 4% Grade 3), and vomiting (23% Grades 1–4, 4% Grade 3).

Future preventive strategies

With the aim of preventing dermatologic AEs during amivantamab treatment, the phase 2 COCOON study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT06120140) is evaluating enhanced preventive dermatologic management in patients treated with first-line amivantamab and lazertinib. The COCOON dermatologic management regimen consists of oral doxycycline or minocycline for 12 weeks followed by topical clindamycin lotion on the scalp, chlorhexidine on the nails, and a ceramide-based moisturizer on the body and face. The first interim analysis showed that during the first 12 weeks of amivantamab plus lazertinib treatment, the incidence of grade 2 or higher dermatologic AEs was 38.6% in patients who were randomized to receive the COCOON prophylactic regimen compared with 76.5% in patients who received standard-of-care dermatologic management (OR, 0.19; 95% CI: 0.09–0.40; P < .0001). Substantial reductions in dermatologic AEs were observed on different body locations, including a 65% reduction in face/body dermatologic AEs (23% vs 62%), a 70% reduction in scalp AEs (9% vs 29%), and a 25% reduction in paronychia (16% vs 21%).

### Guideline for care of patients with the diagnoses of craniosynostosis: working group on craniosynostosis [^114KoJZU]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Crouzon/Pfeiffer Syndrome

Before the discovery of the FGFR2 mutation that causes both Crouzon and Pfeiffer syndromes, the distinction between these 2 clinical diagnoses was based on the deformities of the extremities. In most patients of hand and foot deformities, the diagnosis was Pfeiffer syndrome. Because a number of identical FGFR2 mutations are reported in patients who were clinically diagnosed with either Crouzon or Pfeiffer syndrome, the distinction between these 2 syndromes seems to be of less relevance.

Cohen describes Pfeiffer syndrome, in which the deformities of the extremities consist of broad thumbs and halluces with radial or medial deformities, brachydactyly, and a varying degree of syndactyly. Progressive ankylosis of the elbows is possible.

Anderson describes mild radiologic deformities of the feet, such as deformities in shape, fusion or underdevelopment of the phalanges, metatarsalia, and tarsalia. Only 3 of the 18 patients had no deformities.

The FGFR1 P25R mutation shows characteristic hand and foot deformities with partial webbing of the fingers with broad thumbs and big toes, deviating toward medial, and characteristic syndactyly of the second web and sometimes of the third web. The patients of the reported 3 families had, however, minimal or no craniosynostosis. Some patients had ankylosis of the elbow.

Therapy: surgical corrections of the hands are necessary in only very few patients.

Conclusions

Considerations

Patients with (still) unoperated hands frequently show paronychia. Hardly anything about this condition, however, is reported in the medical literature. These infections cause a lot of discomfort for the patient and require intensive care. Early treatment of the complex syndactyly improves this situation. Therefore, either prevention or treatment of paronychia is an additional reason to commence with early treatment of the hand deformity.

Recommendations

The functions of the upper and lower extremities of Apert patients need to be monitored during time with physical examinations and radiography. Treatment of the hands should commence at the earliest age possible, especially for type 3, and preferably performed simultaneously for both hands by a pediatric surgeon.

Monitoring of the lower extremities is performed by a pediatric orthopedic surgeon/pediatric rehabilitation physician/pediatric plastic surgeon.

Nail Changes.

When monitoring for paronychia or fissures, it is important to begin careful inspections of the hands and feet early during treatment and to continue these inspections at every clinic visit. If nail abnormalities are identified, the treatments described included antibacterial emollient applied regularly, corticosteroid ointments, or a white vinegar in water solution (1 part vinegar, 1 part water). Other suggested treatments for paronychia include the use of gentamycin ointment for 4 to 5 weeks, bathing the hands and/or feet in a diluted chloramine bath, and wearing loose-fitting shoes to avoid pressure to the nail beds. Preemptive daily treatment with corticosteroids was shown to reduce the incidence of paronychia in both the J-STEPP and STEPP studies.

Hair Abnormalities.

For the treatment of trichomegaly, the reported data suggest trimming eyelashes that are long or curled (usually by an ophthalmologist) and removing eyelashes that have misdirected growth (again, usually by an ophthalmologist). For other hair and scalp problems, emollients, such as those used for skin rash, and erythromycin ophthalmic ointments can be used. Patients who experience an acneiform eruption on the scalp can be treated with an oil bath and topical steroid therapy. If the eruption is infected, an oil bath, followed by treatment with oral antibiotics, has been recommended; topical antibiotics, such as neomycin and bacitracin, are not effective in the treatment of scalp infections. Hair stickiness can also be treated with an oil bath or using mild shampoos.

Acneiform Rash

1.300000000000000e+01 For mild acneiform rashes, patients should use a topical antibiotic and/or low-potency topical corticosteroid.

Overall, topical antibiotics are typically the first choice of treatment. Topical corticosteroids are then added only if notable inflammation is present with no sign of infection. Swabs should be considered to guide therapy if appropriate.

1.400000000000000e+01 For patients with severe acneiform rashes, physicians should consider using semisynthetic oral tetracyclines. If the patient is aged < 8 years, the use of topical antibiotics is preferred.

Oral antibiotics can be considered in more severe cases. Empirical treatment in line with acne management guidelines is recommended, unless bacterial swab sensitivities are available to guide treatment choice. Oral tetracyclines should be used for 2–6 weeks, as long as the patient is symptomatic. Minocycline is sometimes used; however, it is not recommended due to its associated AE profile. Systemic doxycycline treatment has been used to successfully treat a case of iatrogenic MEK1/2 inhibitor-induced acneiform rash following a slight worsening of the skin lesions after initial treatment with topical erythromycin cream and fusidic acid plus betamethasone cream. Resolution of a case of recalcitrant selumetinib-induced paronychia with doxycycline following treatment with various antibiotics, topical medications, and surgeries that were only deemed to be minimally effective, has also been reported for a 12-year-old patient with NF1. Therefore, doxycycline may be an acceptable therapeutic agent for patients aged ≥ 8 years with dermatologic AEs that have otherwise been difficult to treat.

### Mitigation and management of adverse events associated with amivantamab therapy [^111ymggP]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Amivantamab is a fully human bispecific epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-directed and mesenchymal epithelial transition (MET) receptor-directed antibody. Intravenous amivantamab is approved and recommended by treatment guidelines as a first-line treatment (1L) in combination with lazertinib, as a second-line treatment (2L) in combination with chemotherapy in adults with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations, and as 2L monotherapy or 1L in combination with chemotherapy in adults with advanced or metastatic NSCLC with exon 20 insertion-mutations. Compared with previous therapies, novel treatments such as amivantamab may be associated with distinct and unique adverse reactions that potentially require optimized prevention and management techniques. Commonly reported adverse reactions associated with amivantamab treatment regimens include cutaneous reactions associated with EGFR inhibition, such as rash, paronychia, and pruritus; those associated with MET inhibition, such as peripheral edema and hypoalbuminemia; and general effects, such as infusion-related reactions. Recommendations are summarized from published guidelines and the authors' clinical experience for the prevention and management of adverse reactions associated with amivantamab. An understanding of the expected adverse events with amivantamab regimens, along with the range of prophylactic and management options available, may facilitate maintenance of ongoing treatment in patients deriving clinical benefit and improve patient quality of life on therapy.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

The safety of ANZUPGO was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, multicenter, vehicle-controlled clinical trials (TRIAL 1 and TRIAL 2), in which 959 adults with moderate to severe CHE received ANZUPGO or vehicle cream topically twice daily for 16 weeks. A total of 638 subjects were treated with ANZUPGO [see Clinical Studies (14)].

In TRIAL 1 and TRIAL 2, adverse reactions that were reported in ≤ 1% of subjects in the ANZUPGO group were application site pain, paresthesia, pruritus, erythema, and bacterial skin infections including finger cellulitis, paronychia, other skin infections, leukopenia, and neutropenia.

In an open label extension trial (TRIAL 3), 801 subjects were treated for up to an additional 36 weeks after completing TRIAL 1 or TRIAL 2. A total of 198 subjects received continuous treatment with ANZUPGO for 52 weeks. Eczema herpeticum was observed in one subject and herpes zoster was observed in two subjects treated with ANZUPGO.

### Acute hand infections [^114b3AHg]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute hand infections are often caused by puncture wounds and are generally classified into superficial or deep infections. Superficial infections occur in the skin and subcutaneous tissues, whereas deep infections can involve the tendon sheaths, adjacent anatomic compartments, deep fascial planes, bursae, joint spaces, and bones. Superficial hand infections are more common than deep infections and are typically managed with elevation, warm soaks, splinting in the position of function, analgesics, and empiric antibiotics when indicated. Paronychia, which can be acute or chronic, is an infection or inflammation of the nail fold. Treatment involves warm soaks, topical antibiotics, and abscess drainage, if indicated. A felon is an infection of the distal pulp of the finger. Treatment often involves surgical drainage and empiric oral antibiotics. Herpetic whitlow is caused by herpes simplex virus and typically resolves without intervention. Deep hand infections include pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis and clenched-fist bite wounds. Pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis is a rapidly progressing bacterial infection of the flexor tendon sheaths in the hand, most commonly caused by a penetrating injury to the finger. Clenched-fist bite wounds result from direct contact of the fist on incisor teeth and are associated with polymicrobial infections. Empiric antibiotics and prompt surgical consultation are indicated to reduce long-term morbidity.

### Mitigation and management of adverse events associated with amivantamab therapy [^115UfJC8]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Amivantamab is a fully human bispecific epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)–directed and mesenchymal epithelial transition (MET) receptor–directed antibody. Intravenous amivantamab is approved and recommended by treatment guidelines as a first-line treatment (1L) in combination with lazertinib, as a second-line treatment (2L) in combination with chemotherapy in adults with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations, and as 2L monotherapy or 1L in combination with chemotherapy in adults with advanced or metastatic NSCLC with exon 20 insertion-mutations. Compared with previous therapies, novel treatments such as amivantamab may be associated with distinct and unique adverse reactions that potentially require optimized prevention and management techniques. Commonly reported adverse reactions associated with amivantamab treatment regimens include cutaneous reactions associated with EGFR inhibition, such as rash, paronychia, and pruritus; those associated with MET inhibition, such as peripheral edema and hypoalbuminemia; and general effects, such as infusion-related reactions. Recommendations are summarized from published guidelines and the authors' clinical experience for the prevention and management of adverse reactions associated with amivantamab. An understanding of the expected adverse events with amivantamab regimens, along with the range of prophylactic and management options available, may facilitate maintenance of ongoing treatment in patients deriving clinical benefit and improve patient quality of life on therapy.

Fig. 4
a Painful onycholysis with docetaxel. b Diffuse paronychia secondary to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor therapy

Patients treated with MEKIs, EGFRIs, and mTOR inhibitors can also develop mild to moderate changes of the nail bed and matrix. These lesions are characterized by mild onycholysis, brittle nails, and a slower nail growth rate.

Selective pan-FGFR 1–4 inhibitors are a new class of targeted therapy drugs currently under development for a large range of solid tumors. More than 35% of patients receiving these drugs experience very severe nail toxicities 1–2 months after starting the treatment, with onycholysis, onychomadesis, and nail bed superinfection occurring. These dose-dependent adverse events are similar to taxane-related nail changes. Ibrutinib is a first-in-class, oral covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase that is now approved in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and cell mantle lymphoma. Nail changes including brittle nails (23–67% of patients), onychoschizia, onychorrhexis, and onycholysis have been described. These nail changes become apparent after several months of treatment (median 6–9 months) and are commonly associated with hair changes.

Preventive Strategies for Targeted Therapy-Induced Nail Toxicities

To prevent nail adverse effects of targeted therapies, it is recommended that patients be counselled and properly educated with clear and detailed information, and offered appropriate preventive strategies (avoid repeated trauma or friction and pressure on nails and nail beds; use protective gloves; avoid prolonged contact with water; do not use nail polish removers and hardeners; trim nails regularly; apply topical emollients daily and US Food and Drug Administration [FDA]-approved nail lacquers; wear comfortable, wide-fitting footwear and cotton socks) upon initiation of the treatment, particularly for patients treated with EGFRIs. Clinicians should be proactive and aggressive when addressing very severe toxicities such as painful onycholysis or pyogenic granuloma.

### Terminal syme amputation of the great toe in the pediatric population [^114hLU32]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In the pediatric population, chronic ingrown toenails (onychocryptosis) can cause infection (paronychia), debilitating pain, and may be unresponsive to conservative treatments. Following multiple failed interventions, a terminal Syme amputation is one option for definitive treatment of chronic onychocryptosis. This procedure involves amputation of the distal aspect of the distal phalanx of the great toe with complete removal of the nail bed and germinal center, preventing further nail growth and recurrence.

Methods

A retrospective review was performed to determine outcomes of a terminal Syme amputation in the pediatric population. Inclusion criteria included treatment of onychocryptosis involving terminal Syme amputation with a minimum follow-up of 1 year. The medical record was reviewed to assess previous failed treatment efforts, perioperative complications, radiographic outcomes, and the need for additional procedures.

Results

From 1984 to 2017, 11 patients (13 halluces) with onychocryptosis were treated with a terminal Syme amputation. There were no intraoperative complications. One hallux had a postoperative infection requiring antibiotics as well as partial nail regrowth following the terminal Syme procedure that required subsequent removal of the residual nail. Following partial nail ablation, the patient had no further nail growth. An additional patient also developed a postoperative infection requiring oral antibiotic treatment. All patients returned to full weight-bearing physical activities within 6 weeks of surgery.

Conclusions

Terminal Syme amputation was successful in treating pediatric patients who have recalcitrant onychocryptosis and paronychia. There was little functional consequence following terminal Syme amputation of the great toe in this patient population, making it an effective salvage procedure.

### The role of dermocosmetics in the management of cancer-related skin toxicities: international expert consensus [^115DaqGG]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Photosensitivity

Sun exposure and ultraviolet (UV) light can exacerbate skin toxicities, including rash and xerosis. UVA has a major role in this setting, and it is important to educate patients about the need to use broad-spectrum sunscreen with UVA (covering long UVA wavelengths: 330–450 nm) and UVB filters along with good sun protection (clothing, hats, UV films on windows). In addition, sun exposure can lead to pigmentation changes in dark-skinned patients. If the patient finds sunscreen irritating, sunscreens with physical blocks such as zinc oxide or titanium dioxide can be used.

Skin/nail changes

Anticancer treatments can cause nail changes by affecting the rapidly dividing matrix cells of the nail plate. Nail changes are common with cytotoxic therapy, EGFR inhibitors, and radiotherapy (Table 1); they are usually — but not always — transient and resolve with discontinuation of therapy. They often occur after 1–2 months of treatment and can include onycholysis, paronychia, and changes in pigmentation/texture. While some nail changes have primarily a cosmetic aspect, others may cause significant pain. This toxicity has a high psychological impact and can be difficult to treat. Patients should be educated about the potential for nail changes, including a discussion about preventive measures such as minimizing pressure, trauma, and friction on the nails. Irritants such as frequent or prolonged water exposure, aggressive manicures, nail biting, and artificial nails should be avoided during treatment. Generally, nail toxicities are managed conservatively and do not require drug withdrawal. However, discontinuation may be needed in severe cases. Application of a nail polish to protect the nails as well as liquid bandages have been used to prevent nails from breaking.

### Dermatologic adverse events associated with selective fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitors: overview, prevention, and management guidelines [^1129f2fh]. The Oncologist (2021). Medium credibility.

Nail Changes

Nail changes are common in patients undergoing treatment with FGFR TKIs [32]. Patients can develop significant adverse events, the most important of which is onycholysis [33], and dose adjustment may be required as a result of this adverse event. Other less common nail events include paronychia, Beau's lines/onychomadesis, and brittle nails (onychoschizia). Paronychia was reported in 24% and 17% of patients with cholangiocarcinoma and urothelial carcinoma, respectively, treated with erdafitinib [28, 34]; furthermore, onycholysis and nail dystrophy were observed in 18% and 16%, respectively, of patients with urothelial carcinoma [28]. Paronychia and onychomadesis were reported in 7% and 18%, respectively, of patients with cholangiocarcinoma who received infigratinib [35].

Nail adverse events, which typically develop within 1–2 months of treatment initiation, can be prolonged and debilitating [32, 36], and in severe cases can cause pain and discomfort, which can lead to treatment discontinuation [37].

Alopecia

Alopecia is a psychosocially impactful consequence of cytotoxic chemotherapy and treatment with kinase inhibitors [38]. Alopecia, which includes the textural changes, thinning, or patchy hair categorized as grade 1 alopecia, and the complete hair loss categorized as grade 2 alopecia, has been reported in patients with cholangiocarcinoma treated with infigratinib. Specifically, 26% of patients treated with infigratinib [35], 46% of those treated with pemigatinib [22], and 24% of patients treated with derazantinib [39] experienced grade 1 or 2 alopecia. In patients with urothelial carcinoma, grade 1 or 2 alopecia occurred in 31%, 39%, and 29% of patients treated with infigratinib [40], pemigatinib [41], and erdafitinib [34].

Other body hair can also be adversely affected in patients undergoing treatment with FGFR inhibitors (e.g. eyelash trichomegaly has been reported with infigratinib) [33].

Question 3: What treatment would be the most effective in treating this condition?
A. Oral biotin supplementation
B. Oral doxycycline
C. Oral itraconazole alone
D. Oral vitamin E with pulsed oral itraconazole
E. Topical 0.05% betamethasone dipropionate cream

Answers:

A. Oral biotin supplementation – Incorrect. Biotin supplementation is a part of the treatment for onychoschizia. One case of successful treatment of YNS using biotin has been documented, although this has not been replicated.
B. Oral doxycycline – Incorrect. Systemic antibiotics are used in the treatment of acute paronychia. However, the use of tetracyclines, such as doxycycline can rarely lead to photo-onycholysis, which can present with nail changes similar to YNS.
C. Oral itraconazole alone – Incorrect. Oral itraconazole monotherapy is the standard of treatment for nondermatophyte mold onychomycosis and is less effective than oral vitamin E and itraconazole combination therapy for the treatment of YNS.
D. Oral vitamin E with pulsed oral itraconazole – Correct. Used to great effect in this patient (Fig 3), oral vitamin E (1200–1600 U/d) with pulsed oral itraconazole (400 mg/d for 1 week per month) is found to have approximately a 50% response rate in patients with YNS.
E. Topical 0.05% betamethasone dipropionate cream – Incorrect. Topical high-potency steroids are the treatment of choice for chronic paronychia but not YNS.

### Common nail disorders [^112JUNdZ]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Brittle nail, simple chronic paronychia, and onycholysis represent three of the most prevalent nail disorders. Brittle nails are characterized by increased fragility of the nail plate due to damage to the nail matrix or changes to nail plate cohesion, caused by internal and/or external factors. Simple chronic paronychia represents an inflammatory process of the lateral and/or proximal nail folds of the fingernails or toenails often preceded by damage to the cuticle. Onycholysis describes the detachment of the nail plate from its nail bed, often attributable to dermatologic conditions, infections, drug therapy, or trauma.

### Panitumumab (Vectibix) [^115KdGYE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In Study 20020408, dermatologic toxicities occurred in 90% of patients receiving Vectibix. Skin toxicity was severe (NCI-CTC Grade 3 and higher) in 15% of patients. Ocular toxicities occurred in 16% of patients and included, but were not limited to, conjunctivitis (5%). One patient experienced an NCI-CTC Grade 3 event of mucosal inflammation. The incidence of paronychia was 25% and was severe in 2% of patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

In Study 20020408 (N = 229), median time to the development of dermatologic, nail, or ocular toxicity was 12 days after the first dose of Vectibix; the median time to most severe skin/ocular toxicity was 15 days after the first dose of Vectibix; and the median time to resolution after the last dose of Vectibix was 98 days. Severe toxicity necessitated dose interruption in 11% of Vectibix-treated patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Subsequent to the development of severe dermatologic toxicities, infectious complications, including sepsis, septic death, necrotizing fasciitis, and abscesses requiring incisions and drainage were reported.

### Cutaneous reactions in children treated with the mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor trametinib for neural tumors [^117WsndY]. Pediatric Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a target for the treatment of a growing number of malignancies. The cutaneous reactions to medications that inhibit this pathway have not been described in children.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was completed for eight children with neural tumors treated with the MAPK extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor trametinib. All children were evaluated by a pediatric dermatologist with documentation of cutaneous findings.

Results

All patients had at least two separate skin reactions while on treatment with trametinib. Common skin findings included xerotic dermatitis, bacterial folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, paronychia, and hair thinning. No child needed to discontinue use of trametinib due to cutaneous toxicities.

Conclusions

Cutaneous reactions are common in children receiving trametinib. Identification of these reactions is the initial step in establishing treatment guidelines that will minimize skin eruptions and subsequent interruption of trametinib treatment.

### Estrogen / HER2 receptor crosstalk in breast cancer: combination therapies to improve outcomes for patients with hormone receptor-positive / HER2-positive breast cancer [^112bZZmA]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Dual HER2 inhibition with synergistic combination of lapatinib and trastuzumab was studied in combination with an AI, without chemotherapy, in the phase III ALTERNATIVE trial (NCT01160211) of patients with HR+/HER2+ metastatic breast cancer who had been treated with prior trastuzumab and ET. Median PFS was significantly improved by 38% with lapatinib, trastuzumab, and AI (11 months) versus trastuzumab and AI (5.6 months; hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45–0.88; P = 0.0063). This effect on PFS was observed across predefined subgroups of patients with measurable disease, patients treated with AIs, and patients who had previously received trastuzumab. Overall response rate and CBR also favored the three-drug combination regimen. In ALTERNATIVE, common AEs (≥ 15%) with lapatinib plus trastuzumab plus AI, trastuzumab plus AI, and lapatinib plus AI were diarrhea (69%, 9%, and 51%, respectively), rash (36%, 2%, and 28%, respectively), nausea (22%, 9%, and 22%, respectively), and paronychia (30%, 0%, and 15%, respectively), most of which were grade 1 or 2. The incidence of serious AEs was similar across groups, and AEs leading to discontinuation were actually lower with lapatinib plus trastuzumab plus AI.

### Chemotherapy-mediated complications of wound healing: an understudied side effect [^113FvLNH]. Advances in Wound Care (2024). Medium credibility.

MEK inhibitors are associated with an increased risk of inflammatory skin rash characterized by papulopustular eruptions and dermatitis acneiform. A rash, or folliculitis, is a typical response to systemic treatment. It occurs in 43% to 85% of patients treated with targeted systemic therapies. Xerosis cutis, a condition characterized by abnormally dry skin, may develop in 35% of patients, even several weeks after systemic therapy. Such a strong drying, in the event of an exacerbation, can cause asteatotic eczema.

It may be complicated by secondary Staphylococcus aureus or Herpes simplex infections. Xerosis cutis and the resulting eczema are often correlated with the patient's age and the tendency to develop atopic dermatitis. Very dry hand skin causes a feeling of pain in the fingers or the formation of fissures on the dorsal sides of the interphalangeal joints. Chemotherapy can also cause other discomforts to the skin and epidermis, leading to reactions such as transient erythema, discoloration, nail changes, and hand–foot syndrome. Immunosuppression is one of the side effects of chemotherapeutics. The inhibition of inflammatory response in the early stages of wound healing impairs the healing process. Reduced activity of neutrophils and macrophages increases the risk of wound infection and delays the removal of dead tissue through phagocytosis. This can often lead to a chronic wound. Chronic wounds are defined as those that do not heal for three months or more.

The most severe complication is hand–foot syndrome. This condition is initially characterized by numbness in the hands and feet, tingling, or burning pain. In the advanced stage, it can cause ulceration and blisters, mainly affecting the palmar and plantar surfaces. It is related to the use of capecitabine and other 5-fluorouracil derivatives. The pathophysiology is not yet well characterized. However, the existing damage to the epithelial cells of the eccrine ducts suggests that basal keratinocytes may be affected.

Some chemotherapy drugs induce venous irritation. These drugs are commonly known as blistering agents. They can cause severe tissue damage, leading to a nonhealing necrotizing ulcer. This kind of toxicity is demanding and requires long treatment. The characteristic symptoms include significant pain and disfigurement. In extreme cases, the condition is associated with nerve damage, which may lead to the loss of limb functionality or even amputation.

A complication affecting the nails is paronychia, an inflammatory reaction of the nail folds resulting from epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors. It is challenging to treat and leads to infections.

### The use of MEK inhibitors in neurofibromatosis type 1-associated tumors and management of toxicities [^111MAUtD]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

For prevention of facial acneiform rash, pimecrolimus cream and clindamycin lotion can be applied to acne‐prone areas (often the "T" zone) morning and night in postpubertal patients at initiation of MEK therapy. For patients who develop a mild acneiform rash despite preventive treatment, topical application of clindamycin 2% lotion and a low‐potency topical steroid such as hydrocortisone 1% lotion can be used twice daily. For moderate to severe acneiform rashes, oral antibiotic treatment is recommended. Doxycycline is typically prescribed for children 8 years of age or older, whereas cephalexin is used for children under 8. Antibiotics should be used for 4 weeks at a minimum and may be continued as long as the patient remains symptomatic.

Eczematous dermatitis can be treated initially with the topical application of pimecrolimus or low‐potency topical steroid such as hydrocortisone 2.5%. For more eczematous rashes that progress, we recommend a mid‐potency topical steroid such as triamcinolone 0.1% ointment applied twice per day until the rash resolves (typically 5–7 days).

Folliculitis can initially be treated with the application of clindamycin lotion to affected areas and the use of germicidal skin cleanser, such as chlorohexidine, in the bath daily. For moderate to severe folliculitis, oral antibiotic treatment is recommended as described above for acneiform rashes.

For patients who develop a mild paronychia, gentle nail care with moisturizers and antiseptic soaks with chlorhexidine for 10–15 minutes used 3–4 times per day are recommended. For moderate paronychia mupirocin, high‐potency topical steroids such as fluocinonide 0.05% ointment can be applied around the inflamed nails twice a day. In these cases, patients should be examined to rule out the presence of a superinfection, which might necessitate oral antibiotics, or an abscess or felon, which may necessitate incision and drainage 39.

### Metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma of the great toe: a case report [^115mRiZd]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Owing to the rarity of metastatic disease to the bones of the foot, the guidelines for the proper care and workup of such conditions are inconsistent. The present case illustrates the evaluation of a patient with established esophageal adenocarcinoma that metastasized to involve the hallux, which had not been confirmed by previous imaging scans. The purpose of reporting the present case was to aid in establishing a protocol for a multidisciplinary approach to patient care and evaluating the entire body when performing metastatic disease treatment. As the present case has shown, evaluation of various abnormalities such as chronic paronychia could mask additional underlying conditions related to the patient's primary cancer.

### Acute paronychia in a neonate secondary to clindamycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^113wh6Qb]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Paronychia is a common inflammatory condition of the nail fold that is often associated with infection. Causes can be fungal, viral, or most commonly, bacterial. Neonatal paronychia is a rare presentation with only one previously reported case in the literature of a patient younger than 1month of age. This is a case of an 8-day-old neonate with acute bacterial paronychia caused by clindamycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

### A randomized controlled trial of epidermal growth factor ointment for treating epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor-induced skin toxicities [^1138ooTv]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

The primary endpoint was response rate (RR) of EGF ointment. Response was defined as follows: (a) reduction of ERSEs from grade ≥ 2 to grade ≤ 1 or (b) grade ≥ 3 ERSEs downgrading to grade 2 and lasting for at least 2 weeks. ERSEs were categorized into palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, acneiform rash, dry skin, pruritus, or paronychia.

The evaluation of ERSEs was performed by a physician in charge of patients. Because the evaluation of ERSEs could be subjective, investigators trained in the assessment method before and during an interim meeting and registered the patient's photograph in the e‐CRF Web site with the patient's consent.

The effectiveness of EGF ointment was assessed at 2 weeks after the treatment and every 4 weeks thereafter. If a patient used the treatment for less than 1 week, the case was unavailable for evaluating response. If skin lesions showed no improvement after application of the ointment for 8 weeks, the treatment was stopped and classified as "no effect". If the investigator determined that additional medication was needed to improve skin lesions and symptoms, oral or intravenous administration of antibiotics, antihistamines, and steroids was allowed during the study. However, topical agents were not permitted. Secondary endpoints included QoL and safety. QoL was evaluated with the Korean version of Skindex‐16 questionnaire. Skindex‐16 is a validated, skin‐disease‐specific, brief quality‐of‐life instrument. The Skindex‐16 survey comprises three domains: symptoms (items 1–4), emotions (items 5–11), and functioning (items 12–16). Responses were scored with a 7‐point scale ranging from 0 (never bothered) to 6 (constantly bothered) 21. Patients responded to 16 items relating to skin condition at baseline and every 4 weeks thereafter. Safety was monitored throughout the study. Adverse events were graded according to NCI‐CTCAE v.4.0.

If only mild inflammation is present and there is no overt cellulitis, treatment consists of warm soaks, topical antibiotics with or without topical steroids, or a combination of topical therapies. Warm soaks have been advocated to assist with spontaneous drainage. 27 Post-drainage soaking with or without Burow solution or 1% acetic acid is generally recommended two or three times per day for two to three days, except after undergoing the Swiss roll technique. The addition of a topical antibiotic and/or steroids can be considered, but there are no evidence-based recommendations to guide this decision. Chronic Paronychia DIAGNOSIS Chronic paronychia results from irritant dermatitis rather than an infection.

TREATMENT Treatment of chronic paronychia consists of stopping the source of irritation, controlling inflammation, and restoring the natural protective barrier. 1 Topical anti-inflammatory agents, steroids, or calcineurin inhibitors are the mainstay of therapy. 33 In a randomized, unblinded, comparative study, tacrolimus 0. 1% was more effective than betamethasone 17-valerate
0. 1%. 33 In severe or refractory cases, more aggressive treatments may be required to stop the inflammation and restore the barrier. If the Swiss roll technique is used, the nail bed will need to be exposed for a longer duration than for acute cases.
23. If a medication is the cause, the physician and patient must decide whether the adverse effects are acceptable for the therapeutic effect of the drug. Discontinuing the medication should reverse the process and allow healing.

Doxycycline has been found effective for treatment of paronychia caused by antiepidermal growth factor receptor antibodies. 5 A case report describes successful treatment with twice-daily application of a 1% solution of povidone/iodine in dimethyl sulfoxide until symptom resolution in patients with chemotherapy-induced chronic paronychia. 34 Zinc deficiency is known to cause nail plate abnormalities and chronic paronychia; treatment with 20 mg of supplemental zinc per day is helpful. 35 It is important to inform the patient that the process can take weeks to months to restore the natural barrier. Effective strategies to avoid offending irritants are listed in Table 2. 5.
