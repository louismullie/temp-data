## Question

Acute myeloid leukemia diagnosis, treatment, history taking

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about acute myeloid leukemia (AML) diagnosis, treatment, and history taking. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic criteria and thresholds, including the 2022 WHO and ICC changes. Then, I should verify the essential elements of history taking and why they matter. Next, I will review the initial laboratory and bone marrow workup, including morphology, immunophenotyping, cytogenetics, and molecular testing. After that, I need to consider risk stratification and how it guides therapy. Finally, I will examine treatment principles, including APL emergencies, fitness assessment, and consolidation strategies, and close with special scenarios and a concise synthesis.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic foundation. AML is classically defined by at least 20% myeloblasts in the bone marrow or peripheral blood, but wait, I should verify the 2022 updates: WHO 2022 recognizes AML with defining genetic abnormalities without a minimum blast count in many cases, whereas ICC retains a 10% blast threshold for AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities and introduces an MDS/AML category for 10–19% blasts, so I need to be precise about which classification frame I'm using before concluding a diagnosis [^117L5qb5] [^114kXR5L].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about history taking; I should confirm which elements directly alter classification and therapy. A careful history must document prior cytotoxic therapy or radiotherapy, antecedent hematologic disorders such as MDS or MDS/MPN, family history of hematologic malignancies, recent growth factor use, and transfusion or medication exposures that could mimic or obscure leukemia, because these factors distinguish therapy-related AML, AML with myelodysplasia-related changes, and secondary AML, and they influence both prognosis and treatment selection [^111DeiX3] [^116cyGT9] [^112y5rfo].

> I need to check the initial laboratory evaluation next. A complete blood count with differential, peripheral smear, comprehensive metabolic panel, uric acid, and LDH are foundational, and coagulation studies are essential given frequent coagulopathy; if APL is suspected, I should act immediately rather than wait for confirmatory testing, but I will come back to that in a moment [^115RkYHY] [^111CytDj].

> Next, I should review the bone marrow workup, because this is where the diagnosis is made and risk is assigned. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy with morphologic assessment, cytochemical stains, flow cytometry for immunophenotyping, conventional cytogenetics, and molecular testing are required; if extramedullary disease is present without marrow involvement, the same studies should be performed on the involved tissue, and I should ensure adequate material is collected for all planned tests to avoid repeat procedures [^116PtzYY] [^113VNyDA] [^116k74KE].

> Let me consider morphology and immunophenotyping carefully. Blasts are identified by cytomorphology and confirmed with myeloid markers such as CD13, CD33, and CD117; monocytic differentiation is supported by CD14, CD11c, or CD64, and I should double-check for Auer rods or myeloperoxidase positivity to anchor myeloid lineage when immunophenotype is ambiguous [^1175TRwU].

> I should confirm the scope of cytogenetics and molecular testing, because these drive both classification and treatment. Conventional karyotyping and FISH detect recurrent translocations such as t(8;21), inv(16)/t(16;16), and t(15;17), and molecular testing should include FLT3-ITD/TKD, NPM1, CEBPA, IDH1/IDH2, TP53, RUNX1, ASXL1, and others per ELN 2022; results should be expedited for immediately actionable mutations, and if local testing is delayed, I should send samples to reference labs or use peripheral blasts to avoid losing time [^116k74KE] [^113uXkn8] [^1175TRwU].

> But wait, what if the presentation suggests APL? I should start ATRA immediately on suspicion, even before confirming PML-RARA, because early ATRA reduces early mortality from bleeding; I need to ensure aggressive supportive care for coagulopathy and monitor for differentiation syndrome, and I should coordinate care at a center experienced in APL management to minimize induction death [^11192FAT] [^112z6FGh] [^115bDhU3].

> Next, I should review risk stratification, since it shapes induction and consolidation choices. ELN 2022 integrates cytogenetics and molecular mutations into adverse, intermediate, and favorable risk categories, and I should remember that secondary AML and TP53-mutated AML carry particularly poor outcomes with conventional chemotherapy, which may shift therapy toward less intensive or targeted approaches even in otherwise "fit" patients [^113uXkn8] [^113Mjqun].

> I will now examine treatment principles, starting with the traditional induction-consolidation paradigm. For fit patients, intensive chemotherapy such as "7+3" remains standard, but I should confirm molecular add-ons: midostaurin for FLT3-mutated AML improves survival and should be added to induction and consolidation, and I should plan allogeneic stem cell transplantation for intermediate- or adverse-risk patients in first remission when appropriate [^116PRb8A] [^117H8rnx].

> Hold on, I should verify the approach for patients deemed unfit for intensive therapy. Less-intensive regimens such as hypomethylating agents plus venetoclax have improved response and survival compared with HMA monotherapy, and I should individualize based on comorbidities, performance status, and patient goals; importantly, age alone should not dictate intensity, and geriatric assessment can uncover vulnerabilities that change management [^116PRb8A] [^113Mjqun].

> Let me reconsider the evolving "fitness" paradigm. Historically, fitness drove intensity, but with targeted therapies, disease biology may trump fitness; for example, TP53-mutated AML often responds poorly to intensive chemotherapy, so even a physiologically fit patient may benefit more from less-intensive, targeted approaches, and I should communicate this nuance during shared decision-making [^113Mjqun] [^113W2h2V].

> I should double-check consolidation planning. After remission, consolidation is tailored to risk: high-risk patients generally proceed to allogeneic transplant in first remission, intermediate-risk patients are often transplanted based on molecular risk and donor availability, and low-risk patients may receive high-dose cytarabine consolidation; I need to ensure early transplant evaluation and donor search to avoid delays [^117H8rnx] [^1134Bpn7].

> Next, I should review special scenarios that change upfront management. Hyperleukocytosis may require emergent cytoreduction with hydroxyurea, cytarabine, or even leukapheresis in select symptomatic cases, though evidence for leukapheresis is limited; therapy-related AML and AML with myelodysplasia-related changes are high-risk and may benefit from CPX-351 rather than conventional 7+3; and germline predisposition syndromes such as DDX41 should be considered, as they affect counseling, donor selection, and sometimes therapy [^115aoqTD] [^112y5rfo] [^117KGhCW].

> Let me synthesize the diagnostic pathway to ensure nothing is missed. Suspect AML with cytopenias or blasts, obtain a targeted history covering exposures and antecedent disease, perform CBC/differential and smear, and proceed to bone marrow with full morphologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular workup; classify using WHO 2022 or ICC 2022 with attention to exceptions for defining genetic lesions, risk-stratify per ELN 2022, and initiate therapy tailored to disease biology and patient factors, including immediate ATRA if APL is suspected [^116PtzYY] [^113uXkn8] [^11192FAT].

---

Diagnosis of AML relies on **bone marrow aspirate/biopsy** showing ≥ 20% myeloblasts [^116YhyZH], with immunophenotyping, cytogenetics, and molecular testing to classify disease and guide therapy [^116PtzYY] [^116k74KE]. Treatment is **risk-adapted**: intensive chemotherapy for fit patients [^1134Bpn7], less-intensive regimens (e.g. hypomethylating agents plus venetoclax) for older or unfit patients [^116PRb8A], and targeted therapies (FLT3, IDH1/2, BCL-2 inhibitors) for specific mutations [^116PRb8A]. History taking should cover **symptoms, prior hematologic disease, cytotoxic exposures, family history, and comorbidities** to inform diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment planning [^111DeiX3] [^116cyGT9].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Initial laboratory tests

- **Complete blood count (CBC) with differential**: Evaluate for anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, and blasts [^115ucJpN].
- **Peripheral smear**: Identify myeloblasts and dysplastic changes [^115ucJpN].
- **Comprehensive metabolic panel**: Assess organ function and electrolytes [^115RkYHY].
- **Coagulation profile**: Screen for DIC, especially in APL [^111CytDj].
- **Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and uric acid**: Prognostic markers [^115RkYHY].

---

### Bone marrow evaluation

- **Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy**: Gold standard; ≥ 20% myeloblasts confirms AML [^116YhyZH].
- **Immunophenotyping (flow cytometry)**: Lineage assignment and blast quantification [^1175TRwU].
- **Cytogenetics**: Karyotype for risk stratification (e.g. t(8;21), inv(16), FLT3-ITD, NPM1) [^116k74KE].
- **Molecular testing**: NGS panels for mutations (FLT3, NPM1, IDH1/2, TP53, CEBPA) to guide therapy [^116k74KE].

---

### Classification systems

Two contemporary systems guide classification: the **WHO 2022** and **ICC 2022** frameworks, which integrate genetics and reduce reliance on blast thresholds [^115kEFcH] [^114kXR5L]. Key differences include blast thresholds and the handling of secondary AML, so results must be interpreted in context [^117L5qb5].

---

## Treatment strategies

### Induction therapy

- **Intensive chemotherapy**: Standard for fit patients (e.g. "7+3" with anthracycline and cytarabine) [^1134Bpn7].
- **Targeted therapies**: Midostaurin (FLT3), gemtuzumab ozogamicin (CD33), venetoclax (BCL-2) combined with hypomethylating agents for older/unfit patients [^116PRb8A].
- **Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT)**: For high-risk or relapsed disease [^117H8rnx].

---

### Consolidation therapy

Consolidation options include **high-dose cytarabine** for favorable-risk disease and **allo-SCT** for intermediate- or adverse-risk disease [^117H8rnx].

---

### Special considerations

In suspected acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), **start ATRA immediately** to reduce bleeding risk, and manage differentiation syndrome proactively [^11192FAT] [^115bDhU3]. For hyperleukocytosis, use **hydroxyurea, cytarabine, or leukapheresis** as indicated [^115aoqTD].

---

## History taking

A thorough history is essential for **diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment planning**:

| **Category** | **Key elements** |
|-|-|
| Symptoms | - Fatigue <br/> - Fever <br/> - Infections <br/> - Bleeding <br/> - Bone pain <br/> - Weight loss [^116mUvUv] |
| Prior hematologic disease | - Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) <br/> - Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) <br/> - Prior AML [^111DeiX3] |
| Exposure history | - Cytotoxic chemotherapy <br/> - Radiation <br/> - Benzene <br/> - Smoking [^111DeiX3] |
| Family history | - Hematologic malignancies <br/> - Genetic predisposition syndromes (e.g. DDX41) [^117KGhCW] |
| Comorbidities | - Cardiac <br/> - Renal <br/> - Hepatic <br/> - Pulmonary disease <br/> - Performance status [^116cyGT9] |

---

## Prognostic factors

Prognosis is shaped by **age, cytogenetics, molecular mutations, performance status, and response to therapy** [^113uXkn8]. Measurable residual disease (MRD) is increasingly used to refine risk and guide treatment decisions [^115yUwpf].

---

## Recent advances

Recent progress includes **12 new approvals since 2017** (e.g. venetoclax, FLT3 inhibitors, IDH inhibitors) [^115qjXVD] and improved integration of molecular testing into classification and therapy [^115kEFcH]. Efforts continue to harmonize WHO and ICC classifications to standardize care [^115kEFcH].

---

AML management is **multidisciplinary and risk-adapted**, with diagnosis anchored in marrow morphology and genetics, and treatment tailored to patient fitness and disease biology. Thorough history taking and rapid molecular testing are critical to optimize outcomes [^116PRb8A].

Assessing the strength of recommendations — grading and decision framework is defined by the panel's key question and judgments: "The central question that the panel addressed in developing the guideline was 'For the initial workup of acute leukemias, including AML, ALL, mixed phenotype acute leukemia, what is the recommended testing for proper diagnosis and prognosis determination?'" "Development of recommendations required that the panel review the identified evidence and make a series of key judgments", including grading strength of evidence: "Strength of evidence is graded as Convincing, Adequate or Inadequate, based on four published criteria", and "Strength of evidence is a key element in determining the strength of a recommendation". When evidence was insufficient, "Recommendations not supported by evidence… were made based on consensus expert opinion". For each statement, "the panel considered the desirable effects, the undesirable effects, the resources required, and feasibility".

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) initial evaluation and workup — The initial evaluation of AML has two objectives: to characterize the disease process based on factors such as prior toxic exposure, antecedent myelodysplasia, and karyotypic and molecular abnormalities, which may provide prognostic information that can impact responsiveness to chemotherapy, risk of relapse, and appropriateness for the use of targeted therapies; and to assess patient-specific factors, including comorbid conditions, which may affect an individual's ability to tolerate therapy, with both disease-specific and individual patient factors taken into consideration when deciding on a treatment strategy. The evaluation and initial workup for suspected AML consists of a comprehensive medical history and physical examination, and laboratory evaluations include a comprehensive metabolic panel and a complete blood count (CBC), including platelets and a differential of white blood cells (WBCs); serum uric acid and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) have prognostic relevance and should be evaluated.

6 Updates on Treatments in Newly Diagnosed

6.1 General Considerations

The classical paradigm to achieve cure in AML is first to induce CR thereby reducing the leukemia burden by several orders of magnitude, followed by post‐remission therapy in the form of chemotherapy and/or alloSCT. The choice of the most appropriate induction and post‐remission therapy is based on multiple parameters, including patient comorbidities, past medical history including prior myeloid disease and/or cytotoxic chemotherapy exposure, AML cytogenetic and molecular risk profile, possibly post‐therapy MRD status, as well as donor availability and patient goals of care. Historically, the first step for deciding on initial treatment is based on patients 'fitness' for intensive therapy, with intensive chemotherapy induction being the default for those who are being deemed fit for a highly myelosuppressive/gut‐toxic approach. It is perhaps easier to delineate who should not receive intensive chemotherapy than who should definitively be subject to a long hospitalization with a significant risk of treatment‐related mortality. At this time, age over 75 is thought to be a relative contraindication to intensive chemotherapy, especially based on the known availability of effective less intensive chemotherapy. Other than age, the FDA has adopted a set of stringent criteria (poor hepatic, renal, cardiac, and pulmonary function) to definitively consider a patient unfit for intensive chemotherapy. The criteria, suggested by Ferrara et al. are commonly incorporated into eligibility criteria and were validated in a large cohort of patients for predicting shorter‐term mortality after intensive chemotherapy treatment in AML. However, with multiple therapeutics emerging in recent years, the paradigm has shifted toward "who would benefit from intensive chemotherapy" rather than who is deemed fit. For instance, even a 'fit' patient (of any age) with adverse risk biology might not be "appropriate" for intensive chemotherapy due the likelihood of poor outcomes. The dilemma is most prominent in patients aged 60–75 years, which represents the largest age group in AML, many of whom can potentially be treated with either intensive or less‐intensive therapies in the upfront setting. We will elaborate on the various therapeutic possibilities and present our approach, including an updated suggested therapeutic algorithm for patients in this age group.

6.2 Updates on Intensive Therapy for Newly Diagnosed Patients

### Diagnosis and treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC) [^112y5rfo]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Substantial confusion exists about the pathologic evaluation needed to diagnose acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC), and treatment decisions based on incomplete or untimely pathology reports may lead to suboptimal treatment.
The patient's clinical history, cytogenetic analysis, mutational analysis, and morphologic evaluation are all important for the diagnosis, prognosis, and subsequent treatment plan for AML-MRC.
Treatments for AML-MRC are conventional chemotherapy, CPX-351 (liposomal daunorubicin/cytarabine), targeted agents based on certain mutations/disease characteristics, and lower-intensity therapies.

The classification of acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC) in general includes patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that develops after myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) or MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), AML with multilineage dysplasia, and de novo AML with certain MDS-related cytogenetic abnormalities. The classification of AML-MRC overlaps somewhat with the traditional term " secondary AML", which includes patients with AML that develops from an antecedent hematologic disorder (including MDS and MDS/MPN), as well as those with therapy-related AML that develops after prior cytotoxic therapy, radiotherapy, or immunosuppressive therapy; however, therapy-related AML is not included in the AML-MRC category.

It has been estimated that AML-MRC represents up to 48% of all adult AML cases. Outcomes for patients with AML-MRC, or more generally those with secondary AML, following conventional combination chemotherapy, are poor compared with many other AML subtypes, with lower remission rates and shorter overall survival (OS). Several new agents have been approved over the past few years for the treatment of various AML subgroups, driving an evolving and complex treatment landscape. Given the high-risk nature of AML-MRC, a clear understanding of the AML-MRC diagnosis and appropriate treatment options is important to help improve outcomes.

CAP/ASH acute leukemia initial diagnostic workup — Statement 1 directs that the treating clinician should provide relevant clinical data or ensure that this is readily accessible by the pathologist, including the patient's age, gender, ethnicity, hematologic history, prior malignancy, exposures to cytotoxic therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or other possibly toxic substances, additional diagnostic or prognostic clinical findings, and history of confounding factors such as recent growth factor therapy, transfusions, or other medications that might obscure or mimic acute leukemia; clinicians should also provide family history of any hematologic disorder or other malignancies. The panel notes that while collecting this information may take time, the benefits grossly outweigh any risks or harms.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for treating newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia in older adults [^115BRsd9]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2020 guideline — scope, key questions, and methods for older adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) note that the panel agreed on 6 critical questions in managing older adults with AML, mirroring real-time practitioner-patient conversations about the decision to pursue antileukemic treatment versus best supportive management, the intensity of therapy, the role and duration of postremission therapy, combination vs monotherapy for induction and beyond, duration of less-intensive therapy, and the role of transfusion support for patients no longer receiving antileukemic therapy; the guideline-development process was supported by systematic evidence reviews up to 24 May 2019 and used the GRADE approach, including GRADE's Evidence-to-Decision frameworks.

---

### Acute myeloid leukemia, version 3.2023, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1112e3YX]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) initial treatment planning emphasizes goals, decision factors, timing, and supportive consultation: The intent of traditional induction chemotherapy is to produce a major reduction in the leukemic burden and to restore normal hematopoiesis. Initial treatment decisions for AML are based on factors including performance status, comorbid conditions, antecedent hematological conditions, prior chemotherapy or RT exposure, and specific disease biology. Although biologic predictors are powerful, initial therapeutic decisions must sometimes be made before this information is fully available, and it may be possible to delay treatment to wait for this biological information; optimizing treatment options based on this information may be ideal. Early in developing a treatment plan, it is reasonable to consider referral to palliative care for consultation.

### Acute myeloid leukemia: 2025 update on diagnosis, risk-stratification, and management [^115qjXVD]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a disease arising from uncontrolled proliferation of clonal hematopoietic cells. It comprises 1% of all new cancer cases in the United States. AML is diagnosed mainly at older age (median age at diagnosis of 68 years) and has an estimated 5‐year OS of 32% (up to 50% in young patients and less than 10% in patients older than 60). However, these outcomes do not fully encompass the dramatic change in the therapeutic landscape, with the approval of 12 new drugs or combination regimens since 2017 (Table 1). Furthermore, novel insights regarding AML biology have impacted our ability to diagnose, prognosticate, and monitor patients with AML.

### Acute myeloid leukemia: 2025 update on diagnosis, risk-stratification, and management [^117KGhCW]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

With recent advances in molecular diagnosis and analysis, more individuals than previously with myeloid malignancies (even those who present at advanced ages) are now recognized to have an inherited germline predisposition. Thus, it has been advocated that MDS and/or AML patients with certain molecular/cytogenetic lesions, a syndromic presentation with a myeloid malignancy, or a suggestive family history undergo a genetic analysis of unaffected tissue to assess for a germline predisposition.

For example, mutations in DDX41 are the most common genetic predisposition in MDS and AML in adults, with germline pathogenic variants carrying an increased risk for MDS or AML found in ~1:430 people in European adults. The occurrence of AML in those with a germline mutation in DDX41 is generally thought to involve a "second‐hit" via a mutation in the other allele. AML with DDX41 germline mutations have unique clinical characteristics: male predominance, presentation in the seventh decade, low peripheral blood leukocyte and bone marrow blast counts, and intensive chemotherapy or venetoclax based‐regimen‐responsiveness, yielding a more favorable prognosis than matched patients with wild type DDX41. Forthcoming discoveries of additional germline predisposition syndromes will likely increasingly impact treatment strategies, such as donor selection for allogeneic stem cell transplant, decisions regarding the choice of the optimal transplant conditioning regimen, or the fashion in which family members are evaluated and monitored.

While advances in AML diagnosis could aid in optimizing individualized therapy, the two novel classification systems challenge communication between health care professionals, especially pathologists, treating clinicians, and patients. In the last few years, numerous comparisons between the two classifications have been conducted and there are calls for a unified diagnostic approach. The similarities between the two classification systems exceed the differences. Nonetheless, the clinician has the responsibility to synthesize the biological, clinical, and personal data while considering the available literature to make a treatment decision. Clearly, the diagnosis alone, whether using the ICC or WHO algorithms cannot be the sole factor in such a decision. Further, the ICC recommends that the molecular tests be available in 3–5 days; this goal is aspirational for many centers around the world. While the integration of novel molecular findings is likely to improve diagnostic accuracy and promote biologically‐based therapy, we should also consider the applicability and generalizability of recommendations for the entire healthcare community, as a major goal is to optimize care of patients worldwide.

### Acute myeloid leukaemia [^1179Fwbo]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute myeloid leukemia:

- **Definition**: AML is a hematopoietic stem cell malignancy associated with abnormal differentiation and proliferation of myeloid clone cells.
- **Pathophysiology**: AML is caused by malignant transformation of hematopoietic progenitor cells secondary to genetic mutations that can be inherited or occur sporadically.
- **Epidemiology**: The age-adjusted incidence of AML in the US is 4.3 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: The oncogenic transformation of hematopoietic progenitor stem cells leads to the production of malignant clones causing increased myeloid blasts (myeloblasts, monoblasts, megakaryoblasts) in the bone marrow and peripheral blood, multiorgan infiltration by blast cells, bone marrow failure, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The median overall survival of AML is 8.5 months, with 2-year and 5-year overall survival being 32.0% and 24.0%, respectively.

### Diagnosis and management of acute myeloid leukemia in adults: recommendations from an international expert panel, on behalf of the European LeukemiaNet [^1116wCmB]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

In 2003, an international working group last reported on recommendations for diagnosis, response assessment, and treatment outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Since that time, considerable progress has been made in elucidating the molecular pathogenesis of the disease that has resulted in the identification of new diagnostic and prognostic markers. Furthermore, therapies are now being developed that target disease-associated molecular defects. Recent developments prompted an international expert panel to provide updated evidence- and expert opinion-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of AML, that contain both minimal requirements for general practice as well as standards for clinical trials. A new standardized reporting system for correlation of cytogenetic and molecular genetic data with clinical data is proposed.

### How I treat acute myeloid leukemia [^1122ih5G]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

More than one quarter of a million adults throughout the world are diagnosed annually with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Despite considerable progress during the past 3 decades in the therapy of AML, two-thirds of young adults and 90% of older adults still die of their disease. The reported median age has increased over the past few decades, mostly because of a greater willingness of physicians to diagnose and treat older patients, and now is 72 years. The greatest challenge is in this age group. However, much improvement in therapy is needed for all adults with AML. Recent advances in allogeneic transplantation, a better understanding of prognostic factors, and development of targeted agents have only modestly improved overall outcome when large populations of patients are considered. Although an explosion in knowledge about the molecular pathogenesis of AML has outpaced treatment advances, such insights hold promise for the development of new therapies directed at specific molecular abnormalities that perturb malignant cell survival pathways. The current approach in 2010 to the management of this disease is presented through a discussion of illustrative cases.

### Acute myeloid leukemia: 2023 update on diagnosis, risk-stratification, and management [^115yUwpf]. American Journal of Hematology (2023). Medium credibility.

Disease Overview

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a frequently fatal bone marrow stem cell cancer characterized by unbridled proliferation of malignant marrow stem cells with associated infection, anemia, and bleeding. An improved understanding of pathophysiology, improvements in measurement technology and at least 10 recently approved therapies have led to revamping the diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic landscape of AML.

Diagnosis

One updated and one new classification system were published in 2022, both emphasizing the integration of molecular analysis into daily practice. Differences between the International Consensus Classification and major revisions from the previous 2016 WHO system provide both challenges and opportunities for care and clinical research.

Risk Assessment and Monitoring

The European Leukemia Net 2022 risk classification integrates knowledge from novel molecular findings and recent trial results, as well as emphasizing dynamic risk based on serial measurable residual disease assessment. However, how to leverage our burgeoning ability to measure a small number of potentially malignant myeloid cells into therapeutic decision making is controversial.

Risk Adapted Therapy

The diagnostic and therapeutic complexity plus the availability of newly approved agents requires a nuanced therapeutic algorithm which should integrate patient goals of care, comorbidities, and disease characteristics including the specific mutational profile of the patient's AML. The framework we suggest only represents the beginning of the discussion.

### Diagnosis and treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC) [^113fGNLY]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC) represents a high-risk and somewhat diverse subtype of AML, and substantial confusion exists about the pathologic evaluation needed for diagnosis, which can include the patient's clinical history, cytogenetic analysis, mutational analysis, and/or morphologic evaluation. Treatment decisions based on incomplete or untimely pathology reports may result in the suboptimal treatment of patients with AML-MRC.

Methods

Using a PubMed search, diagnosis of and treatment options for AML-MRC were investigated.

Results

This article reviews the current diagnostic criteria for AML-MRC, provides guidance on assessments necessary for an AML-MRC diagnosis, summarizes clinical and prognostic features of AML-MRC, and discusses potential therapies for patients with AML-MRC. In addition to conventional chemotherapy, treatment options include CPX-351, a liposomal encapsulation of daunorubicin/cytarabine approved for treatment of adults with AML-MRC; targeted agents for patients with certain mutations/disease characteristics; and lower-intensity therapies for less fit patients.

Conclusions

Given the evolving and complex treatment landscape and the high-risk nature of the AML-MRC population, a clear understanding of the pathology information necessary for AML-MRC diagnosis has become increasingly important to help guide treatment decisions and thereby improve patient outcomes.

Abstract

Objectives

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC) represents a high-risk and somewhat diverse subtype of AML, and substantial confusion exists about the pathologic evaluation needed for diagnosis, which can include the patient's clinical history, cytogenetic analysis, mutational analysis, and/or morphologic evaluation. Treatment decisions based on incomplete or untimely pathology reports may result in the suboptimal treatment of patients with AML-MRC.

Methods

Using a PubMed search, diagnosis of and treatment options for AML-MRC were investigated.

Results

This article reviews the current diagnostic criteria for AML-MRC, provides guidance on assessments necessary for an AML-MRC diagnosis, summarizes clinical and prognostic features of AML-MRC, and discusses potential therapies for patients with AML-MRC. In addition to conventional chemotherapy, treatment options include CPX-351, a liposomal encapsulation of daunorubicin/cytarabine approved for treatment of adults with AML-MRC; targeted agents for patients with certain mutations/disease characteristics; and lower-intensity therapies for less fit patients.

Conclusions

Given the evolving and complex treatment landscape and the high-risk nature of the AML-MRC population, a clear understanding of the pathology information necessary for AML-MRC diagnosis has become increasingly important to help guide treatment decisions and thereby improve patient outcomes.

### Diagnosing and following adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia in the genomic age [^112G71Pt]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and follow-up process of adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is challenging to clinicians and laboratory staff alike. While several sets of recommendations have been published over the years, the development of high throughput screening and characterization for both genetic and epigenetic events have evolved with astonishing speed. Here we attempt to provide a practical guide to diagnose and follow adult AML patients with a focus on how to balance the wealth of information on the one hand, with the restriction put on these processes in terms of time, feasibility and economy when caring for these patients, on the other.

The pathologist must integrate all of this information into the final report as quickly as possible to allow the clinician to make timely treatment decisions. Because an accurate diagnosis of AML-MRC requires critical clinical information, as well as integration of morphology, cytogenetics, and, at times, molecular genetic studies, such a diagnosis creates reporting challenges. Timing of the analyses to accurately diagnose patients with AML-MRC also represents a significant challenge to the optimal treatment of patients. Such challenges in the reporting of AML specimens have been summarized in more detail elsewhere, but all reports need to record information related to prior MDS or MDS/MPN and morphologic descriptions with quantification of dysplasia in nonblast cells, when present. Subsequent cytogenetic and molecular genetic findings must be integrated into a final report to ensure an accurate diagnosis. Ultimately, changes in the diagnostic and therapeutic pathways may be needed to provide optimal treatment of patients with AML-MRC.

Assessments Necessary for AML-MRC Diagnosis

The 2017 guidelines from the College of American Pathologists and the American Society of Hematology specify that the following assessments and testing methods should be employed to accurately identify different subtypes of AML, including AML-MRC. These assessments can help to differentiate AML-MRC from other subtypes of AML Figure 1.

Figure 1
Simplified diagnostic algorithm for AML-MRC. AML, acute myeloid leukemia; AML-MRC, acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes; MDS, myelodysplastic syndrome; MPN, myeloproliferative neoplasm.

A thorough patient history and relevant clinical data, including a physical examination, imaging findings, and blood laboratory values, should be obtained. Patient medical history is important for identifying and excluding individuals with therapy-related AML. According to the current WHO classification, patients with a history of prior cytotoxic therapy should be diagnosed as having therapy-related AML even if they also have features of AML-MRC (eg, antecedent therapy-related MDS that develops into AML).

How Do We Diagnose AML?

AML must be distinguished from other hematologic malignancies, nutritional deficiencies, infections, medication effects, and other differential diagnoses. Diagnostic testing includes complete blood count with peripheral smear to evaluate for leukemic myeloblasts, electrolytes to screen for tumor lysis syndrome, lactate dehydrogenase, and coagulation profile to evaluate for disseminated intravascular coagulation. Diagnosis is made upon bone marrow biopsy with histochemical staining for cytology, flow cytometry, cytogenetics, and molecular studies. Cytogenetic abnormalities inform prognosis, and separate AML into categories as favorable, intermediate, and unfavorable.

### Optimizing therapy for acute myeloid leukemia [^116ftAZB]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2008). Low credibility.

The 10-year overall survival for younger patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia has improved threefold in the past 2 decades. This improvement has occurred in large part because of advances in supportive care and efforts to optimize standard induction and consolidation therapies applied in a stratified approach based on predictors of individual patient risk. Innovations in diagnostic technologies have broadened the understanding of key prognostic factors, including cytogenetic and molecular status, which define the extensive interpatient heterogeneity of this clonal disease. Despite this progress, only approximately 25% of patients who experience a complete remission with cytotoxic chemotherapy (50%-70% of patients with newly diagnosed disease) remain disease-free. Efforts to develop novel agents are actively ongoing, particularly for older patients (age ≥ 60), and targeted therapies, for specific subsets of patients are being based on a better understanding of the biology of the disease.

### Collaborative efforts driving progress in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia [^112CfhSd]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Diagnosis, treatment, response monitoring, and outcome of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have made enormous progress during the past decades. Because AML is a rare type of childhood cancer, with an incidence of approximately seven occurrences per 1 million children annually, national and international collaborative efforts have evolved. This overview describes these efforts and includes a summary of the history and contributions of each of the main collaborative pediatric AML groups worldwide. The focus is on translational and clinical research, which includes past, current, and future clinical trials. Separate sections concern acute promyelocytic leukemia, myeloid leukemia of Down syndrome, and relapsed AML. A plethora of novel antileukemic agents that have emerged, including new classes of drugs, are summarized as well. Finally, an important aspect of the treatment of pediatric AML — supportive care — and late effects are discussed. The future is bright, with a wide range of emerging innovative therapies and with more and more international collaboration that ultimately aim to cure all children with AML, with fewer adverse effects and without late effects.

### Classification of myeloid neoplasms / acute leukemia: global perspectives and the international consensus classification approach [^115YfGpd]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Concluding remarks

The Clinical Advisory Committee process is unique to the classification of hematopoietic neoplasms, especially for the myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemias. A usable disease classification is more than a list of disease names proposed by a single person or small group of individuals, irrespective of their expertise. Establishing a consensus on the detailed criteria that define disease categories is essential for pathologists to be able to make diagnoses that are reproducible around the world. Without well‐established criteria, diagnostic ambiguity occurs which impacts treatment and outcome of individual patients and the ability of clinical trials to provide meaningful results. For this reason, we consider it essential to have convened a CAC of international experts in 2021 in order to revise the existing classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemias that will be used to guide patient management.

### Standardising acute myeloid leukaemia classification systems: a perspective from a panel of international experts [^115kEFcH]. The Lancet: Haematology (2023). High credibility.

The existence of two acute myeloid leukaemia classification systems-one put forth by WHO and one by the International Consensus Classification in 2022-is concerning. Although both systems appropriately move towards genomic disease definitions and reduced emphasis on blast enumeration, there are consequential disagreements between the two systems on what constitutes a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia. This fundamental problem threatens the ability of heath-care providers to diagnose acute myeloid leukaemia, communicate with patients and other health-care providers, and deliver appropriate and consistent management strategies for patients with the condition. Clinical trial eligibility, standardised response assessments, and eventual drug development and regulatory pathways might also be negatively affected by the discrepancies. In this Viewpoint, we review the merits and limitations of both classification systems and illustrate how the coexistence, as well as application of both systems is an undue challenge to patients, clinicians, hematopathologists, sponsors of research, and regulators. Lastly, we emphasise the urgency and propose a roadmap, by which the two divergent classification systems can be harmonised.

9 Choosing a Treatment Strategy

A key question in choosing therapy for an AML patient was traditionally the consideration of eligibility or "fitness" for an intensive 3 + 7‐type regimen. However, the availability of genetically targeted therapies and especially the broad usage of less‐intensive therapies, has shifted the dilemma to the relative likelihood of benefit from intensive chemotherapy. For example, it may be that perfectly fit patients with mutated‐ TP53 may not benefit from intensive chemotherapy regimen or even the addition of venetoclax to HMA. Thus, the therapeutic decision is based on patient age, comorbidities, goals of care, disease characteristics, and perhaps on physician experience. We herein provide some principles that could guide the clinicians thinking about how to treat an AML patient.

9.1 Disease and Treatment‐Driven

The most common cause of death in patients with AML is persistent/relapsed disease.
Certain AML subtypes may have differential responses to different therapy modalities (e.g. TP53‐ mutated AML is poorly responsive to chemotherapy, subtypes with monocytic differentiation may be less responsive to HMA plus venetoclax, and AML with AML‐MR mutations may be more sensitive to venetoclax based therapies.).
Consider whether the patient may become eligible for alloSCT.
Many treatment options, particularly newly approved drugs which present regulatory and financial challenges, may be only available to a subset of AML patients, based on geographic and resource considerations.

9.2 Patient‐Driven

Goals of care should be discussed early on and guide the decision on best treatment for the patient.
Age by itself should not solely guide any treatment modality, especially if curative intent is pursued.
A comprehensive evaluation of comorbidities should be conducted prior to the decision on treatment strategy. AML‐related comorbidities should not be an absolute contraindication to aggressive (or any) therapy.
Older patients should undergo some form of Geriatric Assessment. Although there is no standard assessment, such evaluations can reveal vulnerabilities that are not detected in routine clinical practice, predict morbidity, mortality, and therapeutic toxicities and increase the rates of goals of care/end of life discussion.

Our proposed therapeutic algorithms are based on our experience and our interpretation of the available data. They should be considered a framework for the busy clinician.

### Applicability of 2022 classifications of acute myeloid leukemia in the real-world setting [^114kXR5L]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diagnosis and treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) require an integrated approach that takes into account clinical and laboratory characteristics, morphologic evaluation of bone marrow and peripheral blood, flow cytometry, and cytogenetic and molecular analyses. The recent advances in molecular medicine have unveiled the clinical utility of genomic profiles, which necessitated the integration of this information into daily practice for both diagnostic and prognostic purposes. In 2022, 2 updated classifications and a new prognostic stratification of AML have been proposed, including the fifth edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors, The International Consensus Classification (ICC)of Myeloid Neoplasms and Acute Leukemias, and the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) recommendations for AML prognosis.

Among the main innovations introduced by both diagnostic classifications, the blast threshold required for AML diagnosis is certainly one of the most notable. The limit of 20% blasts continued to be used for the majority of AML categories in the 2016 WHO classification(except for RUNX1 :: RUNX1T1 -AML, CBFB :: MYH11 -AML, and acute promyelocytic leukemia). This threshold was discarded in the group with AML, defining recurrent genetic abnormalities based on the 2022 WHO criteria, but ICC continues to have a 10% limit. For all other AML subtypes, including myelodysplasia (MDS)-related AML (AML-MR), the 20% blast cutoff is maintained. ICC also introduced the MDS/AML subentity in cases with blasts ranging from 10% to 20%, to indicate a fading of the diagnostic boundaries between MDS and AML when judged solely based on blast proportion, thereby emphasizing the increasing importance of molecular footprints to define the various nosologic subtypes. One of the major updates of the 2022 classifications is the more precise and objective definition of secondary AML (sAML). In this context, patients' clinical history is added as a disease attribute in the ICC and includes therapy-related AML or a prior diagnosis of MDS or MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm. Germ line predisposition is also considered as a diagnostic qualifier, and because of its relevant frequency, it has been confirmed as a patient and disease feature requiring specific definition. Furthermore, the prior AML with MDS-related changes is now better defined by a specific genomic signature and referred to as AML-MR within the WHO 2022 classification. Conversely, ICC identifies multiple new subcategories, namely AML with myelodysplasia-related cytogenetic abnormalities (AML-MDSk), AML with MDS-related gene mutations (AML-MDSgene), and AML with mutated TP53 (AML- TP53).

### Diagnostic work-up of acute myeloid leukemia [^114BqkM4]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by a clonal expansion of undifferentiated myeloid precursors resulting in impaired hematopoiesis and bone marrow failure. In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) published revisions to the classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemias. Similar to the 2008 classification, the updated classification incorporates clinical features, morphology, immunophenotyping, and cytogenetics, with greater emphasis on molecular genetics, to define disease entities. This brief review addresses the various components of pathologic assessment to establish a diagnosis of AML and to help risk stratify patients, with an emphasis on newer techniques used in the detection of mutations with prognostic significance, as well as assays employed in the evaluation of minimal residual disease following treatment.

A major revision of the WHO classification of lymphoid and myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia was released in 2016. A key motivation for this update was to include new information available since the 2008 version with clinical relevance for the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of patients. With > 100 entities described, it is important for the clinician to understand features that may be important in daily practice, whereas researchers need to incorporate the new classification scheme into study development and analysis. In this review, we highlight the key aspects of the 2016 update with particular importance to routine patient care and clinical trial design.

An International Working Group met to revise the diagnostic and response criteria for acute myelogenous leukemia originally published in 1990, as well as to provide definitions of outcomes and reporting standards to improve interpretability of data and comparisons among trials. Since the original publication, there have been major advances in our understanding of the biology and molecular genetics of acute leukemia that are clinically relevant and warrant incorporation into response definitions. Differences from the 1990 recommendations included a category of leukemia-free state, new criteria for complete remission, including cytogenetic and molecular remissions and remission duration. Storage of viable blasts for correlative studies is important for future progress in the therapy of these disorders.

### Acute myeloid leukemia: 2025 update on diagnosis, risk-stratification, and management [^113e7sKd]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Disease Overview

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a bone marrow stem cell cancer that is often fatal despite available treatments. Diagnosis, risk assessment, monitoring, and therapeutic management of AML have changed dramatically in the last decade due to increased pathophysiologic understanding, improved assessment technology, and the addition of at least 12 approved therapies.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis is based on the presence of immature leukemia cells in the blood, and/or bone marrow or less often in extra-medullary tissues. New biological insights have been integrated into recent classification systems.

Risk Assessment

The European Leukemia Network has published risk classification algorithms for both intensively and non-intensively treated patients based on cytogenetic and on molecular findings. Prognostic factors may differ based on the therapeutic approach.

Monitoring

Our increasing ability to quantify lower levels of measurable residual disease (MRD) potentially allows better response assessment, as well as dynamic monitoring of disease status. The incorporation of MRD findings into therapeutic decision-making is rapidly evolving.

Risk Adapted Therapy

The availability of 12 newly approved agents has been welcomed; however, optimal strategies incorporating newer agents into therapeutic algorithms are debated. The overarching approach integrates patient and caregiver goals of care, comorbidities, and disease characteristics.

### TARGET's study of acute myeloid leukemia… [^112C6oK7]. NCI (2022). Medium credibility.

TARGET's AML Project TARGET investigators are analyzing tumors from pediatric patients, many who have relapsed, to identify biomarkers that correlate with poor clinical outcome or new therapeutic approaches to treat childhood AML. The tissues used in this study were collected from patients enrolled in Children's Oncology Group biology studies and clinical trials. The TARGET AML project has produced comprehensive genomic profiles of nearly 200 relapse-enriched, clinically annotated patient cases in the discovery data set. This cohort includes ~100 patients with adequate relapse specimens to study as trios. Each AML case includes data from nucleic acid samples extracted from peripheral blood or bone marrow tissues as follows:

- primary tumor sample collected at diagnosis
- case-matched tissue sample collected at remission
- relapsed tumor sample when available; ~50% cases have third sample
- additional cases with partial molecular characterization and/or sequencing data are available to the research community. Tissues and clinical data used for the TARGET AML project were obtained from patients enrolled on biology studies and clinical trials managed through COG. Patient samples with full characterization were chosen based on the following criteria:

- patients achieved a remission following a standard two rounds of induction therapy
- bone marrow and peripheral blood blast counts of > 50% in tumor specimens
- adequate amount of high-quality nucleic acids for comprehensive genomic profiling
- three or fewer clinically-relevant cytogenetic findings.

Some AML patients experience something known as an "induction failure. " Upon diagnosis, AML patients without high-risk genetic markers undergo the primary induction phase: standard chemotherapy regimen to eliminate most cancer cells and induce a remission state. Successful treatment reduces the percentage of myeloblasts detected in the patient to less than 15%. Patients with induction failures are those with greater than 15% myeloblasts. Currently, these patients have few clinical options for further treatment. The TARGET AML Induction Failure subproject has produced comprehensive genomic profiles of 30 clinically annotated patient cases.

Each fully characterized case consists of data generated from nucleic acid samples extracted from case-matched tumor and normal tissues as follows:

- primary tumor sample collected at diagnosis
- control fibroblast sample grown from the patient's bone marrow
- tumor obtained at the end of induction phase of treatment.

### How to manage high-risk acute myeloid leukemia [^115pkb28]. Leukemia (2012). Low credibility.

There are three general options for management of acute myeloid leukemia (AML): standard therapy, investigational therapy or no treatment other than supportive care. Given AML's natural history and the uncertain results inherent in investigational therapy, most patients intuitively prefer standard therapy, by which is usually meant 3+7 or low-dose cytarabine. However, this preference assumes results with standard therapy are 'satisfactory'. Results with standard therapy of AML are, however, so variable that it is difficult to speak of a single result. Therefore, I review prognostic factors with standard therapy to permit physicians to better inform patients of the likely outcome with such therapy, realizing that the same data might prompt one patient/physician to prefer standard therapy and another investigational therapy under the assumption that although plausibly worse than standard the latter cannot be that much worse. Because even in patients aged > 75 years, the principal cause of therapeutic failure is resistance to therapy not treatment-related mortality, I emphasize factors associated with resistance, principally a 'monosomal karyotype' and various molecular markers and extend the European Leukemia Net prognostic system. I also stress the value of waiting for cytogenetic and molecular results before beginning induction therapy and review various investigational options.

Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease that presents with a range of morphological, cytogenetic, immunophenotypic, and biomolecular features. Over the past 20 years, application of new cytogenetic and molecular techniques has greatly improved knowledge of the pathophysiology of AML, resulting in new potential therapeutic applications. However, the results of current therapy are still unsatisfactory, especially in patients who have adverse prognostic factors at the time of diagnosis. Furthermore, some pivotal questions about the procedures of induction and postinduction therapy of AML remain unanswered, and substantial controversy exists on the optimum therapeutic approach for the disorder.

The panel does not suggest that care be delayed or prohibited; however, the panel strongly believes that patients will benefit from having the treating center take the primary role in performing invasive procedures.

### Applicability of 2022 classifications of acute myeloid leukemia in the real-world setting [^11312QrE]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, the use of molecular data is now crucial to precisely diagnose and risk-stratify patients with AML. More than a dozen genes have been incorporated within current diagnostic and prognostic schemes, and genome scanning approaches have been proposed to capture the complexity of AML biology. However, the high costs, expertise level in molecular biology, and issues of standardization still represent hurdles to provide equitable care for patients with AML worldwide. Given the substantial similarities, the conflicts between the newly competing diagnostic systems may be resolved, reaching an agreement on a unified model, which must also take into account the available resources worldwide.

In Australia, a consortium of professional and consumer non‐government organizations has recently assessed the performance of our health system in caring for people with hematological malignancies. Despite excellent outcomes for many patients, gaps have been identified where outcomes can be improved by applying current knowledge. Loud among the calls are the voices advocating equity of access for all patients to receive an accurate diagnosis. Patients know that an accurate diagnosis flows understanding of their prognosis and access to best available therapy. They expect medicine to be able to evaluate their disease with appropriate and precise tests and to categorize it with confidence (i.e. with as little uncertainty as possible). The evolving classification systems for hematological malignancies have served us well in that respect. Looking forward to the next iteration of international classification, I urge all stakeholders — pathologists, physicians, manufacturers, and payers — to work together to enable its implementation so the benefits to patients fully flow.

Comparison between WHO fifth versus ICC AML definitions. * ≥ 20% blasts are required for AML definition. Colors reflect similar subgroups between classifications. AML — acute myeloid leukemia; ICC — international consensus classification; MDS — myelodysplastic syndrome; MPN — myelodysplastic neoplasm; WHO — world health organization.

TABLE 2
Major differences between WHO fifth AML and the ICC AML classifications.

Both classification systems incorporated special consideration for prior cytotoxic exposure and genetic predisposition. In the WHO classification, those were reclassified under a new diagnostic category called secondary myeloid neoplasms encompassing either myeloid neoplasms arising after cytotoxic therapeutics, or those which possess a defined germline predisposition. In the ICC classification, these were considered as qualifiers or annotations to an AML diagnosis rather than a separate diagnostic category (Figure 1).

Therapy‐related AML is traditionally associated with worse prognosis, although it was not officially integrated into the ELN prognostic criteria as adverse risk. Recent discoveries demonstrated that mutations in TP53 and related genes such as PPM1D drive chemoresistance and dismal outcomes. Indeed, the biological characteristics of leukemia generally outweigh clinical history. For example, those who develop APL after exposure to chemotherapy for another cancer are expected to do well.

### Diagnosis and treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC) [^115WQjMP]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

AML-MRC accounts for a substantial proportion of AML cases and includes patients with antecedent hematologic malignancies (eg, MDS) as well as those with de novo AML who have multilineage dysplasia and/or MDS-related cytogenetic abnormalities. AML-MRC primarily occurs in elderly patients and is associated with an increased probability of adverse cytogenetics and worse clinical outcomes. Therefore, there is a need for rapid karyotype analysis or, if not possible, the use of FISH panels to quickly identify the majority of patients with AML-MRC who do not have a history of MDS or multilineage dysplasia. The extra expense of such testing should be balanced with the treatment benefit afforded to the patient by making a diagnosis quickly. NPM1 and CEBPA, along with FLT3, should be evaluated by RT-PCR, as these results typically are obtained more quickly than next-generation sequencing panels, and the results are important for the diagnosis of AML-MRC and for informing treatment decisions.

### How I treat AML incorporating the updated classifications and guidelines [^113ZuzuT]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

The European LeukemiaNet recently revised both the clinical (2022) and measurable residual disease testing (2021) guidelines for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The updated World Health Organization and International Consensus Classification for myeloid neoplasms were also published in 2022. Together, these documents update the classification, risk stratification, prognostication, monitoring recommendations, and response assessment of patients with AML. Increased appreciation of the genetic drivers of AML over the past decade and our increasingly sophisticated understanding of AML biology have been translated into novel therapies and more complex clinical treatment guidelines. Somatic genetic abnormalities and germ line predispositions now define and guide treatment and counseling for the subtypes of this hematologic malignancy. In this How I Treat article, we discuss how we approach AML in daily clinical practice, considering the recent updates in the context of new treatments and discoveries over the past decade.

### Acute myeloid leukemia, version 3.2023, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1134Bpn7]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Principles of acute myeloid leukemia treatment — Treatment of acute leukemia has historically been divided into induction chemotherapy and postremission (eg, consolidation) therapy, and in patients fit for intensive induction therapy, strategies for consolidation are based on the potential risk of relapse, with patients with higher risk disease receiving more intensive therapy. Cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities are the most significant prognostic indicators; however, failure to achieve remission after 1 cycle of induction therapy or high tumor burden, defined as a WBC count ≥ 40 × 10⁹/L, are included as poor-risk factors for long-term remission. Response is assessed based on bone marrow (BM) morphology and cytogenetic and molecular responses taken at several points during the course of treatment, and the use of flow cytometry and/or molecular methods to assess measurable residual disease (MRD) is emerging as a novel determinant to assess the depth of therapeutic response at the time of morphologic remission in patients with AML.

### Management approach to acute myeloid leukemia leveraging the available resources in view of the latest evidence: consensus of the Saudi society of blood and marrow transplantation [^1175TRwU]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

The criteria for the diagnosis of AML depend on the number of myeloblasts within the bone marrow or peripheral blood. The 2016 revision of the WHO classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia stated that the diagnosis of AML is established when the myeloblasts represent at least 20% of the nucleated cells in the bone marrow (biopsy or aspirate) or peripheral blood smear and at least 500 bone marrow nucleated cells or 200 peripheral blood leukocytes should be counted. Patients with AML-related recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities, for example, t(8:21), are diagnosed as AML cases, irrespective of the blast count. The identification of the myeloid lineage of blasts is done through the visualization of Auer rods, positive myeloperoxidase staining, or, more frequently, the overexpression of myeloid markers such as CD13, CD33, or CD117 by flow cytometry. The presence of monocytic markers (such as CD14, CD11c, or CD64) provides evidence of monocytic differentiation of leukemic cells. Past medical history of previous exposure to radiation or chemotherapy is important to establish the diagnosis of therapy-related AML. A history of myelodysplastic syndrome or myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative neoplasm, in addition to other criteria, is also important for establishing the diagnosis of AML with myelodysplastic-related changes. The 2016 revision of the WHO classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia provides the full classification of AML. The diagnostic workup that informs the risk stratification and treatment approaches includes cytogenetics and molecular investigations. Various genetic testing techniques are available to characterize the genetic alterations in patients with AML. Conventional karyotyping can mainly identify numerical abnormalities, and fluorescence in situ hybridization allows for high-resolution analysis of recurrent structural chromosomal rearrangements, specific to AML. Fluorescence in situ hybridization is mandatory if conventional karyotyping failed to detect cryptic aberrations (ie, inv16), specifically in AML with normal karyotypes. Molecular testing for certain genetic mutations such as FLT3 (internal tandem duplication [ITD] and tyrosine kinase domain), using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, must be expedited to initiate the FLT3 inhibitor. Other molecular studies to detect mutational genetic abnormalities are important for the risk stratification (TP53, NPM1, RUNX1, ASXL1, KIT and biallelic CEBPA). Molecular studies using a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction are required for the quantification of a fusion transcript for RUNX1-RUNX1T1, CBFB-MYH11, and PMLRARA, as well as quantitative polymerase chain reaction for NPM1 mutation, at the time of diagnosis and during the treatment for measurable residual disease (MRD) monitoring. The recommendation is to perform these tests on bone marrow samples, preferably on the first bone marrow aspirate obtained to avoid sample hemodilution. The use of NGS with the common myeloid gene panel gained importance to inform the risk stratification and therapeutic options.

In the face of such results, it is sobering to remember, however, that not all patients with APL fare this well. Indeed, APL remains extremely deadly up front, with such outstanding outcomes restricted largely to those patients in whom the diagnosis is actually suspected, treatment with ATRA is started immediately at the first suspicion of APL, coagulation abnormalities are corrected aggressively, and referral/transfer to a leukemia-treating center is initiated promptly, together with timely prevention/ management of APL differentiation syndrome. In the absence of such timely diagnosis and treatment, outcomes remain poor. More than 60 years after its initial description, early death remains the major problem in APL management.

Over the last 10 years, several groups, both in Europe and in North America, have confirmed that APL early death rates are higher in real life than would be suggested by clinical trial outcomes, have identified factors and management gaps potentially contributing to early death, and have suggested possible interventions to improve outcomes. Such studies have been heterogeneous in design and execution, and have included populationbased registry analyses, as well as single-centre and multiple- centre retrospective reviews, from multiple jurisdictions, so inter-study comparisons have been difficult. While there are some discrepancies among studies, triggering attempts to explain these differences, common themes include reported early death rates ranging from 9–30%, with most early deaths occurring within the first 7–10 days, and most commonly related to hemorrhage (commonly intracerebral). In addition, some (but not all) studies have suggested that early deaths increased with delay in APL diagnosis, delay in ATRA initiation, delay in hospital admission, older age of the patients, and admission to a non-teaching hospital. Consistent with the last point, when considered together with the rarity of APL, physicians' awareness and experience have also been suggested as gaps. While delay in starting ATRA treatment was identified by some groups as a key factor in early deaths, and 30-day mortality was shown to decrease significantly from the pre-ATRA to the post-ATRA era, two population-based studies did not observe decreasing early death rates over time, contrary to what would have been expected with increased ATRA usage over the same time period. Early death in APL patients is clearly multifactorial in origin. Differences among study outcomes remain poorly explained, but are presumably related to patient, institutional, and jurisdictional differences, among others, including, speculatively, interrelated differences in healthcare availability and socio-economic status.

Secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) is a complex diagnosis that includes AML caused by either an antecedent hematologic disease (AML-AHD) or from previous treatment with chemotherapy or radiation. This disease carries a poor prognosis and is historically chemorefractory; additionally, often patients are ineligible for standard chemotherapy because of advanced age and other comorbidities. The advances of molecular diagnostics and reclassification of World Health Organization criteria have aided in the categorization of this disease. This article describes the etiology and pathophysiology of sAML, and delves into past successful treatments as well as promising new treatments.

### Contemporary management of acute myeloid leukemia: a review [^116PRb8A]. JAMA Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal hematopoietic cancer that disrupts normal hematopoiesis, ultimately leading to bone marrow failure and death. The annual incidence rate of AML is 4.1 per 100 000 people in the US and is higher in patients older than 65 years. Acute myeloid leukemia includes numerous subgroups with heterogeneous molecular profiles, treatment response, and prognosis. This review discusses the evidence supporting frontline therapies in AML, the major principles that guide therapy, and progress with molecularly targeted therapy.

Observations

Acute myeloid leukemia is a genetically complex, dynamic disease. The most commonly altered genes include FLT3, NPM1, DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, TET2, RUNX1, NRAS, and TP53. The incidence of these alterations varies by patient age, history of antecedent hematologic cancer, and previous exposure to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for any cancer. Since 2010, molecular data have been incorporated into AML prognostication, gradually leading to incorporation of targeted therapies into the initial treatment approach of induction chemotherapy and subsequent management. The first molecularly targeted inhibitor, midostaurin, was approved to treat patients with AML with FLT3 variants in 2017. Since then, the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of AML has expanded, allowing the identification of additional potential targets for drug therapy, treatment incorporation of molecularly targeted therapies (midostaurin, gilteritinib, and quizartinib targeting FLT3 variants; ivosidenib and olutasidenib targeting IDH1 variants, and enasidenib targeting IDH2), and identification of rational combination regimens. The approval of hypomethylating agents combined with venetoclax has revolutionized the therapy of AML in older adults, extending survival over monotherapy. Additionally, patients are now referred for hematopoietic cell transplant on a more rational basis.

Conclusions and Relevance

In the era of genomic medicine, AML treatment is customized to the patient's comorbidities and AML genomic profile.

### Acute myeloid leukemia: current progress and future directions [^1172gNZh]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Progress in the understanding of the biology and therapy of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is occurring rapidly. Since 2017, nine agents have been approved for various indications in AML. These included several targeted therapies like venetoclax, FLT3 inhibitors, IDH inhibitors, and others. The management of AML is complicated, highlighting the need for expertise in order to deliver optimal therapy and achieve optimal outcomes. The multiple subentities in AML require very different therapies. In this review, we summarize the important pathophysiologies driving AML, review current therapies in standard practice, and address present and future research directions.

### Childhood acute myeloid leukemia treatment (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^111eQeno]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

The World Health Organization's classification system for acute myeloid leukemia was developed after the FAB system, and it is the primary system used now. The WHO classification was initially and primarily based on cytogenetics and morphology, and it now also uses molecular genetics. It has gone through several iterations, with the latest publication in 2022. M1: Acute myeloblastic leukemia with minimal differentiation but with the expression of MPO that is detected by immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry. M2: Acute myeloblastic leukemia with differentiation. M3: Acute promyelocytic leukemia hypergranular type. KMT2A translocations, which collectively made up nearly half of childhood AML cases, were classified as AML with recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities.

This classification system also decreased the required bone marrow percentage of leukemic blasts for the diagnosis of AML from 30% to 20%. An additional clarification was made so that patients with recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities did not need to meet the minimum blast requirement to be considered an AML patient. Histochemical evaluation It is critical to distinguish AML from acute lymphoblastic leukemia because the treatment for children with AML differs significantly from that for ALL. Special histochemical stains performed on bone marrow specimens of children with acute leukemia can be helpful to confirm their diagnosis. The stains most commonly used and variably positive in AML include myeloperoxidase, nonspecific esterases, and Sudan Black B, whereas periodic acid-Schiff is usually positive in ALL, M6 AML, and, occasionally, M4 and M5 FAB subtypes.

Immunophenotypic evaluation The use of monoclonal antibodies via flow cytometry to determine cell-surface antigens of AML cells is now the primary tool used to diagnose AML. Various lineage-specific monoclonal antibodies that detect antigens on AML cells should be used at the time of initial diagnostic workup, along with a battery of lineage-specific T-lymphocyte and B-lymphocyte markers to help distinguish AML from ALL and acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage. M6: Glycophorin expression is helpful in diagnosing M6.

Conclusions

To date, the classification of AML and hematologic malignancies has generally relied on experts in the field who meet every couple of years to produce consensus recommendations based on their interpretation of the best available evidence. As lower-intensity therapies are increasingly used for the treatment of AML, a dedicated risk stratification system is urgently needed. An increasingly scientific approach to genetic evaluation, both at diagnosis (for prognostication, treatment assignment-based predictive biomarkers for specific therapies, and homogenous interpretable clinical trials) and after treatment (for prognostication, treatment assignment, and personalization of therapy based on the risk of relapse) is positively influencing diagnostic classifications and clinical guidelines. In the future, hematologic neoplasm classification and clinical treatment guideline revisions will increasingly focus on improving prognostication and guiding personalized precision therapies. Experts in the field have called for the establishment of an international working group to encourage this cooperation and the unification of such classifications. Ultimately, we need substantially better treatment options for all AML patients, with the hope that a new era of precision medicine will facilitate discovery by separating signals from noise, leading to new options and approaches for the treatment of patients with AML.

Perspective from Professor Andrew Roberts, Theme Leader, Cancer Research and Treatments, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Metcalf Chair of Leukemia Research, University of Melbourne, Clinical Hematologist, Clinical Hematology, Royal Melbourne Hospital & Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Australia

The care of patients with newly diagnosed hematological malignancies has never been in greater flux. With greater power than ever before to probe differences and commonalities in genetic abnormalities between patients, and equipped with an increasing armamentarium of targeted therapies, each with their own more selective range of activity, physicians, and patients are now faced with more decisions than ever. These advances bring the promise of precision medicine several steps closer to reality, but inevitably generate greater uncertainty. For physicians, this uncertainty becomes apparent as we ask ourselves important questions, such as: how sure am I that this is the right diagnosis for this condition; have I ordered all the necessary tests and properly interpreted them; this test result does not seem to fit the diagnosis, is that a problem; does this diagnosis dictate what is the best treatment; and will that same treatment work if I have not made the correct diagnosis? For patients receiving transparent information and advice from their physician, this uncertainty can be a barrier to accepting considered recommendations or increase susceptibility to the negative effects of misinformation spread via social media.

Central to enabling rational and evidence‐backed decision making in clinical practice is getting the diagnosis correct. Hematology has advanced because our forebears have assimilated insights to the pathophysiology of disease into the clinical and morphological algorithms that generate our current integrated diagnostic classification system. As our knowledge grows, our diagnostic classification system must evolve. In this light, it is time for the classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia to be updated. We need it to further integrate robust patterns of morphology, immunophenotype, cytogenetics, and molecular aberrations into rational diagnostic categories. In doing so, we need to be continually mindful of the performance characteristics of new molecular tests. However, classification systems should lead hematology forward, and not be held back by variable issues in test implementation. The latter will be most rapidly solved when their importance to diagnosis is considered established and demanded by physicians and patients alike.

The WHO classification

Table 1 provides an overview of the different categories and subtypes of AML and related neoplasms. Further details on AML subtypes are given in the following paragraph. Here, we only focus on details of classification that need specific diagnostic approaches and sometimes directly lead to prognostic and therapeutic consequences.

Table 1
Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and related precursor neoplasms according to the WHO classification (2017).

Although genetics plays a crucial and partly entity‐defining role for the classification of AML according to WHO, the presence of ≥ 20% blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow is a requirement for AML diagnosis, making cytomorphology essential for AML classification.

However, there are three exceptions, for which the AML diagnosis is made independent of blast count:
AML with t(8;21)(q22; q22.1); RUNX1‐RUNX1T1.
AML with inv(16)(p13.1q22) or t(16;16)(p13.1; q22); CBFB‐MYH11.
APL (acute promyelocytic leukaemia) with t(15;17)(q22; q11‐12); PML‐RARA.

In the absence of subtype‐defining aberrations, cases with AML can be categorised into AML with myelodysplasia‐related changes, therapy‐related neoplasms or AML, NOS.

Classification of AML with myelodyplasia‐related changes depends on multidisciplinary diagnostics. In addition to the presence of ≥ 20% blasts, cases must exhibit MDS‐related features which are defined as (i) a history of MDS or MDS/MPN (myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm); (ii) MDS‐related cytogenetic abnormalities; or (iii) multilineage dysplasia (as defined by the presence of ≥ 50% dysplastic cells in 2–3 haematopoietic lineages, assessed by bone marrow cytomorphology). Up to ~25% of de novo AML cases present with multilineage dysplasia (Haferlach et al. 2003). The presence of multilineage dysplasia, however, does not influence the prognosis in AML with NPM1 mutation (Falini et al. 2010) or AML with biallelic CEBPA mutation (Bacher et al. 2012), NPM1 and biallelic CEBPA mutations thus take diagnostic precedence over multilineage dysplasia (Swerdlow et al. 2017).

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) — coagulation and cardiac assessment indicates that coagulopathy is common at presentation and it is standard clinical practice to screen by evaluating prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and fibrinogen activity as part of the initial evaluation and before any invasive procedure. The need for a cardiac evaluation (eg, echocardiogram or multigated acquisition [MUGA] scan) should be determined based on individual risk factors; patients with a history or symptoms of cardiac disease, prior exposure to cardiotoxic drugs or thoracic RT, or those of an older age should have an echocardiogram, whereas in younger, otherwise asymptomatic patients with no history of cardiac disease an echocardiogram can be considered, and treatment should not be delayed for an echocardiogram in acutely ill patients. A small study of 76 patients with cancer identified only 4 with cardiac abnormalities on screening, and in these 4 patients the presence of cardiac disease did not change the course of treatment.

The treatment choice for newly diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is no longer straightforward. Historically, patient fitness has been a major driver of the initial therapy decision based on the belief that intensive chemotherapy would be the optimal choice if a patient were "fit" enough to receive it. Tools based on chronological age, performance status, and comorbidities have been developed to help estimate patient fitness. With newer approved therapies that include nonintensive options such as IDH1 inhibition or less intensive options such as hypomethylating agent (HMA)- or low-dose cytarabine (LDAC)-based combinations with venetoclax, the choice of frontline AML therapy places more emphasis on disease-specific features, including cytogenetics and mutational profile. Moreover, newer treatments have higher response rates than what has been expected with older nonintensive options such as LDAC or HMA monotherapy. We present cases of three patients with AML with varying cytogenetic and molecular risks to demonstrate the important but changing role of patient fitness in the current era of expanding therapeutic options.

### Evaluating sixty years of UK trials research in acute myeloid leukaemia: lessons for trial design, past, present and future [^113voXKt]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Medium credibility.

Since the launch of their first trial in Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in 1959, the Medical Research Council (and latterly National Cancer Research Institute) has conducted randomised trials in AML uninterrupted for six decades. These sixty years have seen a transformation in the way we diagnose, characterise and treat the disease, (and indeed a sea change in clinical trial regulations) and a continuing improvement in outcomes. The increasing refinement of diagnosis, leading to the advent of tailored therapies, and the use of disease monitoring both have the potential to improve outcomes further, but the associated complexities will require an evolution in our approach to trial design. This article looks at the extent to which the guiding principles of the first AML trials remain relevant today, and the challenges facing the next generation of trials methodologists.

### Acute myeloid leukemia: 2025 update on diagnosis, risk-stratification, and management [^117L5qb5]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

The WHO and ICC classifications employ different blast thresholds to define AML in certain situations: There is no minimum threshold in the WHO criteria for AML with defining genetic abnormalities (with the exception 20% required for AML with BCR::ABL1 and AML with CEBPA bZIP mutation); the ICC requires at least 10% blasts in the bone marrow or peripheral blood for defining AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities (with the exception of ≥ 20% in AML with BCR::ABL1 or with prior MDS/MPN, e.g. chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [CMML]). For all other AML subgroups, the 20% blasts threshold was retained by the WHO. However, The ICC introduced a new category of MDS/AML comprising those with 10%–19% blasts in the bone marrow or peripheral blood, in recognition of the similarities in biology and prognosis between such patients and those with ≥ 20% myeloblasts. Whether a patient who has an AML defining‐genetic lesion with a relatively low blast count responds to therapy similarly to those with the same lesion and higher blasts count remains to proven prospectively.

The definition of AML with myelodysplasia related changes (MRC) was not included in either classification system. Instead, both WHO and ICC introduced categories with molecular and cytogenetic abnormalities that define functional secondary ontogeny and are associated with poor prognosis when treated with intensive chemotherapy. However, the definition of "secondary" differs between classifications. The WHO defined AML myelodysplasia‐related (AML‐MR) which includes one of the following: (1) a clinical history of MDS or MDS/MPN, (2) cytogenetics typical of MDS, or (3) molecularly defined based on the presence of one of eight secondary ontogeny defining mutations. In contrast, ICC included two separate entities of secondary AML: molecularly defined (termed AML with myelodysplasia‐related gene mutations) and cytogenetically defined (termed AML with myelodysplasia‐related cytogenetic abnormalities). Furthermore, in the ICC, a clinical history of prior MDS or MDS/MPN is used to annotate the diagnosis of AML, rather than being considered a separate entity. In addition, the molecular and cytogenetic abnormalities considered MDS‐defining differ slightly between the two classifications. For example, a RUNX1 mutation is included as myelodysplasia‐defining in the ICC definition, but not in the WHO 2022 criteria, (Figure 1 and Table 2).

### Acute myeloid leukemia, version 3.2023, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115tw9Ss]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

NCCN recommendations for induction therapy in acute promyelocytic leukemia — general principles state that the Panel recommends treatment according to one of the regimens established from the clinical trials, and one should use a regimen consistently through all components of the protocol and not mix induction regimens from one trial with consolidation regimens from another trial. The Panel emphasizes the importance of receiving treatment from an established treatment center, and collaboration with a center with expertise has been shown to reduce induction mortality. Recommendations are broken down by risk classification using WBC count (cutoff of 10 x 10⁹/L) at diagnosis and whether patients with high-risk disease have cardiac issues, and it is important that regimens containing ATRA and ATO be administered unless there is a contraindication based on extenuating patient circumstances.

Acute myeloid leukemia — molecular risk stratification and testing logistics emphasize that several gene mutations have prognostic and therapeutic implications, and comprehensive testing is recommended and should be operationalized promptly. In addition, several gene mutations are associated with specific prognoses in a subset of patients (category 2A) and may guide treatment decisions (category 2B). Molecular analyses for lesions that allow risk stratification per ELN 2022 are recommended for all patients at diagnosis. All patients should be tested for mutations, and multiplex gene panels and targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis are recommended for the ongoing management of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in various phases of treatment. Additional molecular and genetic testing for heritable hematologic malignancy predisposition may be considered in a subset of patients. To appropriately stratify therapy options, test results of molecular and cytogenetic analyses of immediately actionable genes or chromosomal abnormalities should be expedited. Adequate marrow should be available at the time of diagnosis or relapse for molecular studies as per the institutional practice, and local pathologists should be consulted to optimize collection and preservation. If molecular testing is not available at the patient's treatment center, evaluation at an outside reference laboratory or transfer to another institution is recommended prior to performing the bone marrow (BM) evaluation; circulating leukemic blasts from peripheral blood may alternatively be used to detect molecular abnormalities.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Leukemia is a cancer of the white blood cells that spreads throughout the bloodstream and may affect many organs. It originates in the bone marrow, which is where all blood cells are developed before being released into the bloodstream. Leukemia is classified based on the type of abnormal white blood cell and by how rapidly these cells leave the bone marrow and enter the bloodstream. Acute myeloid leukemia is the most common type of leukemia that affects adults. The June 10, 2009, issue of JAMA contains an article on allogeneic stem cell transplantation as a treatment for AML. Signs and symptoms Excessive fatigue.

Fevers with night sweats Recurrent infections Swollen or bleeding gums Loss of appetite Enlarged liver or spleen Easy bruising Bone or joint pain Diagnostic tests Complete medical history and physical examination Blood tests Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. Chest x-ray Echocardiogram of the heart Treatment Determined by: The age of the patient and differs for those younger than 60 compared to those older than 60 Whether they have received prior chemotherapy Whether they have other medical problems Treatment is carried out in 2 phases: Induction uses chemotherapy to induce remission Consolidation therapy is used to achieve a long-lasting remission. The type of treatment offered in this phase depends on the response to the treatment used in the induction phase.

Consolidation therapy options include: High-dose chemotherapy Stem cell transplant from the patient himself or herself in remission or from an identical twin.
