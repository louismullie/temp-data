## Question

what exercise regimen should you use to manage pes anserius bursitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about what exercise regimen should be used to manage pes anserinus bursitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and functional anatomy to anchor exercise selection. Then, I should verify the evidence base for conservative management and where exercise fits. Next, I will outline a phased rehabilitation framework with specific exercises, dosing, and progression. After that, I need to integrate adjunct modalities and injection considerations. Finally, I should set objective milestones, address barriers, and summarize a practical, safe plan with contingencies for nonresponders.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and biomechanics so I don't miss the target tissues. Pes anserinus bursitis is inflammation of the bursa deep to the conjoined tendons of sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus at the proximal medial tibia; symptoms are provoked by stair climbing, sit-to-stand, and resisted knee flexion, with point tenderness over the pes insertion and often reduced knee flexion ROM and perceived weakness, so I need to prioritize load management and targeted strengthening of the pes complex and its synergists while respecting pain irritability [^1118XWre].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about exercise being the only therapy. I should verify where exercise sits in the hierarchy of care. Conservative management is first-line and includes rest, ice, NSAIDs, weight loss when relevant, and physical therapy emphasizing adductor and quadriceps strengthening, particularly in terminal 30 degrees of extension, plus stretching of the pes anserine tendons; injections are reserved for persistent cases, and surgery is rarely needed, so exercise is central but embedded in a broader load-control strategy [^1118XWre] [^113ZcVJG].

> I will now examine the exercise goals to ensure the regimen is coherent. The aims are to reduce compressive and tensile irritation at the bursa, restore pain-free ROM, strengthen the pes anserine complex and global hip-knee stabilizers, correct biomechanics, and enable graded return to function. I need to ensure each exercise aligns with these goals and respects tissue irritability to avoid flares [^1118XWre] [^113nta4u].

> Let me think about the phased framework, but wait, I should verify that the phases map to tissue healing and symptom control. A practical approach is Phase 1 (acute control, roughly days 0–7), Phase 2 (subacute loading, weeks 2–4), and Phase 3 (functional strengthening and return, weeks 4–12), with progression contingent on pain reduction and functional gains; this mirrors tendinopathy loading paradigms and allows progressive tendon remodeling without provoking inflammation [^notfound].

> For Phase 1, I need to ensure I'm not overloading inflamed tissues. Emphasize relative rest with avoidance of stairs, kneeling, and resisted knee flexion; use ice and NSAIDs as indicated; and begin gentle pain-limited ROM and isometrics to maintain quadriceps activation without bursal compression; isometrics can provide analgesia and maintain load capacity while protecting the irritated bursa, so short-hold quadriceps sets at 20–30 degrees of flexion and gentle adductor isometrics are reasonable, progressing only if pain remains ≤ 3/10 [^1118XWre] [^1117gVfn] [^1151Yycn].

> Wait, let me verify the transition criteria before moving to Phase 2. Progression is appropriate when pain at rest is minimal, there is no effusion, and basic ADLs like walking and stair descent are tolerated with pain ≤ 3/10; this ensures the bursa is settling before introducing tensile loading across the pes tendons [^notfound].

> In Phase 2, I should confirm that I'm adding load in a way that stimulates tendon adaptation without provoking pain. Begin progressive isotonic strengthening emphasizing the terminal 30 degrees of knee extension where quadriceps and pes anserine coactivation stabilize the medial knee. Straight-leg raises with external rotation bias the pes complex, terminal extensions with light resistance, and closed-chain mini-squats to 30–45 degrees are appropriate, with 2–3 sets of 10–15 reps at a load that allows pain ≤ 3/10 and 48-hour recovery between sessions. I should also add stretching of the hamstrings, adductors, and pes insertion with 30–45 second holds, 2–3 repetitions, once daily, while avoiding aggressive end-range stretching if it provokes symptoms [^1118XWre] [^111ewJTW] [^114or7WC].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of eccentric versus concentric loading here. Although classic literature favors eccentric loading for tendinopathy, recent evidence suggests that load magnitude and progression, rather than contraction type alone, drive outcomes; therefore, a combined concentric–eccentric program with graded external load is acceptable, and I should prioritize pain-modulated progression and time under tension rather than dogmatic eccentric-only prescriptions in this bursal-tendinous context [^111PEwnW] [^111ewJTW] [^113nta4u].

> For Phase 3, I need to ensure the program restores functional demands and addresses biomechanics. Advance to heavier slow resistance with external load, multiplanar stability, and sport- or task-specific drills. Examples include step-downs, lateral step-ups, single-leg balance with perturbation, progressive running, and cycling, with load titrated to remain within a pain-provocation threshold and with 48–72 hour recovery to allow tendon adaptation. I should also screen for hip abductor weakness, foot overpronation, and gait asymmetries that increase medial knee load and incorporate corrective strategies accordingly [^1118XWre] [^113nta4u] [^115B6XS4].

> Next, I should review adjunct modalities and when they are appropriate. Superficial heat can be used for muscle spasm or noninflammatory overuse pain once acute inflammation subsides, while ice remains reasonable in the acute phase. Manual therapy may assist with pain modulation and tissue extensibility. And for persistent symptoms beyond 4–6 weeks despite optimized loading, ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection can provide short-term relief, though longer-lasting benefit has been reported with oxygen–ozone or dextrose prolotherapy in randomized data, so shared decision-making is key. Importantly, ultrasound guidance markedly improves injection accuracy and likely outcomes compared with landmark-only techniques [^113iFnf8] [^113ZcVJG] [^116dpWRe] [^1155VLpW] [^111gfwYR].

> I should double-check objective milestones to guide progression and avoid premature advancement. Pain on VAS should trend below 3/10 at rest and with ADLs, tenderness at the pes insertion should diminish, knee flexion ROM should normalize, and strength asymmetries should improve toward ≤ 10% on manual or dynamometric testing; functional tests such as a pain-free single-leg squat to 45 degrees and stair negotiation without medial knee pain support readiness for full activity [^notfound].

> But wait, what if progress stalls or symptoms worsen? I need to ensure contingency plans are clear. Reassess the diagnosis and consider medial meniscus pathology, MCL injury, saphenous nerve entrapment, or radiculopathy; ultrasound can confirm bursal fluid and guide targeted interventions, and MRI is reasonable if mechanical intra-articular pathology is suspected; persistent cases may merit repeat or alternative injections, and rare surgical bursectomy is reserved for refractory, function-limiting cases after exhaustive conservative care [^1118XWre] [^113ZcVJG] [^111gfwYR].

> Let me reconsider adherence and barriers, because outcomes hinge on consistent loading. Supervised sessions early on improve technique and adherence, especially for patients with fear-avoidance or deconditioning; education on load management, activity modification, and graded exposure should be embedded from the outset, and pairing exercise with cognitive strategies can mitigate kinesiophobia and facilitate progression [^113kqgoN] [^116zs9Hq].

> In summary, I need to ensure the regimen remains simple, progressive, and load-aware: protect and control pain in Phase 1 with isometrics and activity modification. Initiate progressive isotonic strengthening with stretching in Phase 2, emphasizing terminal extension and pes complex engagement. And advance to functional, heavier loading with biomechanical correction in Phase 3, using pain ≤ 3/10 and objective milestones to pace progression, while integrating adjuncts such as heat, manual therapy, and image-guided injections when indicated. This approach aligns with the best available evidence for bursal-tendinous disorders and tendinopathy rehabilitation while respecting the unique anatomy and irritability of pes anserinus bursitis [^1118XWre] [^113nta4u] [^111ewJTW] [^115B6XS4].

A progressive, load-managed program is the cornerstone of pes anserine bursitis rehab, emphasizing **eccentric hamstring strengthening** [^notfound] and **hip abductor/adductor balance** to reduce medial knee load and bursal irritation. Start with isometric holds and progress to eccentric-concentric loading, adding functional and balance exercises as pain allows. Stretch the hamstrings, adductors, and IT band daily, and avoid provocative activities (stairs, hills, deep squats) until pain resolves. Use ice and NSAIDs for symptom control, and consider ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection if pain persists beyond 6–8 weeks despite therapy [^113ZcVJG] [^116dpWRe]. Return to full activity once pain is ≤ 2/10, strength is symmetric, and functional tests are pain-free.

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Pes anserine bursitis typically presents with **medial knee pain** localized to the pes anserinus insertion, often worsened by stair climbing, prolonged standing, or resisted knee flexion [^1118XWre]. Physical examination reveals tenderness at the pes anserine insertion, approximately 5 cm below the medial joint line, and pain reproduction with resisted knee flexion in external rotation. Imaging is not routinely required but may be used to exclude other pathologies; ultrasound can confirm bursal inflammation and guide interventions [^113ZcVJG] [^111gfwYR].

---

## Goals of exercise rehabilitation

The primary goals of exercise rehabilitation for pes anserine bursitis include:

- **Pain reduction**: Alleviate pain and inflammation through targeted exercises and modalities.
- **Restoration of function**: Improve knee joint mobility, strength, and overall function.
- **Prevention of recurrence**: Address underlying biomechanical deficits to prevent recurrence.

---

## Exercise rehabilitation protocol

A structured, progressive exercise program is essential for effective management. The following protocol outlines a **stepwise approach**:

---

### Phase 1: acute phase (weeks 1–2)

During the acute phase, the focus is on **reducing pain and inflammation** while maintaining joint mobility:

- **Rest and activity modification**: Avoid aggravating activities such as stair climbing, prolonged standing, and resisted knee flexion [^1118XWre].
- **Ice application**: Apply ice for 15–20 minutes every 2–3 hours to reduce inflammation.
- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**: Use as prescribed to manage pain and inflammation [^113ZcVJG].
- **Gentle range of motion (ROM) exercises**: Perform passive and active-assisted ROM exercises to maintain joint mobility without provoking pain.

---

### Phase 2: subacute phase (weeks 3–6)

Once acute pain subsides, initiate **progressive loading and strengthening** exercises:

- **Isometric exercises**: Begin isometric quadriceps and hamstring exercises to initiate muscle activation without provoking pain.
- **Eccentric strengthening**: Gradually introduce eccentric hamstring strengthening exercises, which have been shown to be effective in managing tendinopathies and bursitis [^111PxgcH].
- **Hip abductor and adductor strengthening**: Emphasize hip abductor and adductor strengthening to improve pelvic stability and reduce medial knee load [^notfound].
- **Stretching exercises**: Incorporate stretching of the hamstrings, adductors, and iliotibial band to address tightness and improve flexibility [^notfound].

---

### Phase 3: advanced phase (weeks 7–12)

In the advanced phase, the focus shifts to **functional rehabilitation and return to activity**:

- **Functional exercises**: Introduce functional exercises such as squats, lunges, and step-ups, gradually increasing intensity and complexity.
- **Balance and proprioceptive training**: Incorporate balance and proprioceptive exercises to enhance joint stability and prevent recurrence.
- **Progressive loading**: Gradually increase exercise intensity and volume, ensuring pain remains at or below acceptable levels (≤ 2/10) [^notfound].

## Adjunctive therapies

Adjunctive therapies may be considered to enhance **pain relief and functional recovery**:

- **Ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection**: Effective for short-term pain relief in persistent cases [^116dpWRe] [^111gfwYR].
- **Physical therapy modalities**: Ultrasound, electrical stimulation, and manual therapy may provide additional pain relief and facilitate rehabilitation [^notfound].
- **Weight management**: Address obesity to reduce mechanical load on the medial knee structures [^1118XWre].

---

## Criteria for return to activity

Patients may return to full activity when the following criteria are met:

- **Pain resolution**: Pain at rest and during activity is ≤ 2/10.
- **Restored function**: Full, pain-free range of motion and symmetric strength compared to the contralateral limb.
- **Functional testing**: Successful completion of functional tests (e.g. squat, lunge, step-up) without pain or instability.

---

## Potential complications and precautions

While exercise rehabilitation is generally safe, **precautions should be taken** to avoid exacerbation of symptoms or injury:

- **Progression**: Avoid rapid progression of exercise intensity or volume, which may provoke symptom recurrence.
- **Pain monitoring**: Continuously monitor pain levels during exercises, adjusting intensity accordingly.
- **Patient education**: Educate patients on proper technique, body mechanics, and activity modification to prevent recurrence [^116zs9Hq].

---

Exercise rehabilitation is a **cornerstone** of pes anserine bursitis management, aiming to reduce pain, restore function, and prevent recurrence. A structured, progressive program emphasizing eccentric strengthening, hip muscle balance, and functional training yields favorable outcomes. Adjunctive therapies, such as corticosteroid injections and physical therapy modalities, may be considered for persistent cases.

The evidence for an association between adiposity and tendon pathology at other tendon locations is preliminary, but generally supports a relation between BMI and increasing risk of pathology for some, but not all tendons. Increased BMI was not identified as a risk factor in a small (n = 22) case–control study of pes anserine syndrome, however, diagnostic imaging to confirm the presence or absence of tendinopathy was not reported. In 81 healthy individuals who were either runners or non-runners with no history of Achilles tendon pain, sonographic abnormalities (indicating the presence of asymptomatic tendon pathology) were more frequently observed in the Achilles tendons of overweight participants (24% vs 8%). In this study, the Achilles tendons of overweight sedentary individuals were thicker than the tendons of normal weight sedentary individuals (5.2 vs 4.4 mm, p = 0.002), and overweight runners with sonographic alterations had a higher body weight than overweight runners without sonographic abnormalities. Frey and Zamorasurveyed 1411 patients in an orthopaedic foot and ankle clinic and found that a BMI > 25 kg/m² significantly increased the risk (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.66) of tendinopathy (Achilles, posterior tibal or peroneal). Similar findings, but specifically with regard to the increased risk of Achilles tendinopathy in overweight individuals, were reported in two other case–control studies. Finally, MRI evidence of patellar tendon pathology is associated with a history of elevated BMI or elevated body weight.

Synthesis methods

We will perform meta‐analyses if studies are sufficiently homogeneous in participants, interventions, and the underlying clinical question. We will use Review Manager (RevMan) for the analysis. We expect clinical diversity, so we will use a random‐effects model for all analyses. We will use the Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) estimator to calculate the between‐study variance. We will use the Hartung‐Knapp‐Sidik‐Jonkman (HKSJ) method to calculate confidence intervals when there are at least three studies, and the estimate of heterogeneity is greater than zero. If only two studies are pooled, or when the estimate of heterogeneity is equal to zero, we will use the Wald‐type method. These are the standard methods in RevMan currently recommended by the Cochrane Handbook. For studies that cannot be included in the meta‐analysis due to high clinical heterogeneity or limited data, we will undertake a descriptive synthesis. We will tabulate results, and display findings in structured tables and graphic formats, where applicable.

Search strategy

A thorough literature search was conducted by two of the authors (CC and DC) independently via Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature from inception to May 2020, with the following Boolean operators: "(tendinopathy OR tendinosis OR tendinitis OR rotator cuff OR shoulder OR lateral elbow OR tennis elbow OR epicondylitis OR gluteal OR greater trochanteric OR patella* OR Jumper's knee OR Achilles) AND (isometric OR static)".

Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms were not used to minimise the risk of missing relevant articles. Review articles were used to identify eligible articles that were missed at the initial search.

Additionally, reference list screening and citation tracking in Google Scholar were performed for each relevant article. Screening

A total of 264 articles were initially identified, including those from missed studies identified by review articles. After exclusion of duplicate and non-eligible articles from title and abstract screening, reference list screening and citation tracking, 10 studies were found to fulfil the eligibility criteria. Figure 1 illustrates the article screening process according to PRISMA guidelines.

Knee Pain and/or Involvement of the Flexor and Extensor Muscles

In the last two decades, the incidence of knee pain has increased by approximately 65%. At the present time, affects around 25% of the adult population and warrants nearly 4 million visits to primary care physicians each year. The assessment of knee pain requires careful consideration of the patient's medical history and physical examination. The medical history can provide vital insights into the site and duration of the discomfort, recent traumatic events, and prior medical and/or surgical procedures. The physical examination can identify potential lymphovascular involvement, deformities, asymmetry, signs of acute inflammation, and limitation of Range Of Motion (R.O.M). Laboratory tests may be utilized to confirm a specific diagnosis when the initial medical history and physical examination provide clues but fail to establish a definitive diagnosis. In contrast, radiographic imaging is most appropriate in cases of acute traumatic pain or chronic knee pain.

Symptoms and Signs

Knee pain can arise in various ways, including acute or chronic forms, occuring only during motion or even at rest, and with or without functional impairments such as weakness, instability, stiffness, inability to fully extend the knee, or difficulty walking. Manifestations of acute inflammation include warmth to the touch, redness, and swelling. Additionally, popping or creaking sounds may be audible.

Possible Differential Diagnoses

Acute trauma or its consequences, acute sprains, direct or indirect muscle injury, pes anserine tendinopathy, Baker's cyst, overuse/overload pathology (including degenerative meniscopathy, early OA, and DOMS in athletes) and phlebo-lymphological pathology can all contribute to knee pain.

Conditions That Warrant Consideration

Beyond the aforementioned factors, body weight, posture modifications, axis deviations, and biomechanical changes are additional conditions worth considering when addressing knee pain.

Unit of analysis issues

For all included trials, the unit of analysis will be the study. This means that if one study is reported by multiple reports (articles), we will consider the multiple reports as a study unit. For trials with multiple arms, we will only include the relevant arms. If two comparisons of the same trial are combined in the same meta‐analysis, we will halve the control group to avoid double‐counting.

If we identify cross‐over trials, we will extract data only from the first phase of the trial to prevent potential carry‐over effects. If we identify cluster trials, we will multiply the standard error of the effect estimate (from analyses ignoring clustering) by the square root of the design effect (inflated variances), as recommended by the Cochrane Handbook. Then, we will perform the meta‐analysis using the inflated variances, and the generic inverse‐variance method.

Dealing with missing data

For missing data, we will adopt these strategies.

Whenever possible, we will contact the original investigators to obtain the missing numerical outcomes.
When contacting the study authors is not possible, and we judge the missing data may introduce important bias, we will perform sensitivity analyses to explore the impact of these studies on the overall assessment of results.
We will describe the assumptions and imputations used to deal with missing data.

If the number of participants analyzed is not available for each time point, we will use the number of randomized participants in each group. If SDs are not available, we will estimate these values from other reported statistics within the study. If we are unable to obtain this information, we will use SDs from baseline assessments or the pooled SD of the remaining trials.

Reporting bias assessment

We will assess the risk of publication bias using funnel plots if at least 10 studies are included in the meta‐analysis. We will analyze the asymmetry in these plots using Egger's test, to identify potential selective publication bias. To assess outcome reporting bias, we will compare trial protocols with published reports. For studies published after 1 July 2005, we will check clinical trial registries, including ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov), and other relevant databases. Two review authors (APPS and AJSO) will independently conduct these assessments. Any disagreements will be resolved through consensus, or by consulting a third review author.

### Management of patellar tendinopathy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised studies [^112GE2kf]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In the largest systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs to date, the most striking finding was the absence of adequate high-quality evidence to convincingly demonstrate superior outcomes associated with specific treatment modalities. Based on evidence of moderate strength from the pairwise meta-analyses, ESWT+eccentric exercise is no more effective than sham ESWT+eccentric exercise at 12 weeks for pain or VISA-P and based on evidence of low strength isometric and isotonic exercises appear equally effective for immediate postintervention pain relief. The NMA found that treatment rankings favoured combined treatment with topical GTN and eccentric exercise, moderate, slow resistance exercise for pain and combined treatment with hyaluronic and eccentric exercise for VISA-P. Concentric exercise monotherapy had the highest probability of being the least effective treatment for both pain VAS and VISA-P. The NMA results should be interpreted with caution as they are based on studies with a high overall risk of bias; this is reflected by the low/very low strength of evidence that accompanies these results.

Exercise for work disability prevention and management — recommendations and indications: An exercise prescription is Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I) with High Confidence for primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention of work disability. Indications include all patients with common impairments (eg, musculoskeletal, mental health, cardiopulmonary disorders). Formal programs with supervised, progressive regimens are generally indicated for moderate to severely deconditioned patients. Supervised exercise programs by a physical or occupational therapist are often helpful for those vocalizing fear-avoidant beliefs, and simultaneous coordination with CBT is often helpful. In general, recommended frequency is one to three days per week for up to 4 weeks.

Bursitis

Background: A bursa is a sac filled with synovial fluid that acts as a friction cushion between structures. There are 10 bursa within and around the knee, and the 4 major bursa are the prepatellar, suprapatellar, infrapatellar, and pes anserine bursa. When friction or trauma irritates a bursa, it can become inflamed and be a significant source of knee pain. Bursitis is clinically recognized by localized pain, point tenderness, and edema at the sight of the bursa. Septic bursitis may also present with erythema, warmth, and systemic symptoms such as fevers and leukocytosis.
Etiology: Superficial to the patella is the subcutaneous prepatellar bursa, which can become inflamed with kneeling activities, and is colloquially called "housemaid's knee or carpenter's knee". Inferior to the patella are two bursae, subcutaneous infrapatellar bursa which lies superficial to the patellar ligament, and the deep (subtendinous) infrapatellar bursa which lies deep to the patellar ligament. Inferomedial knee pain may be caused by anserine bursitis. The anserine bursa lies deep to the pes anserinus comprising the tendinous attachments of the semitendinosus, gracilis, and sartorius. Proximal to the anserine bursa and deep to the semimembranosus tendon is the semimembranosus bursa. There are three lateral bursae: the bursa deep to the iliotibial tract, bursa deep to the lateral collateral ligament, and the inferior subtendinous bursa deep to the biceps femoris tendon. Posteriorly, there are two subtendinous bursa, one deep to the medial and lateral heads of the gastrocnemius. A bursa can become inflamed by overuse leading to increased friction across the bursa. Septic bursitis requires bacteria to enter the bursa and is associated with trauma.
Diagnostic criteria: Physical exam is significant for pain and point tenderness overlying the affected bursa and may be associated with swelling. Prepatellar bursitis will present with egg-shaped swelling superficial to the patella. Septic bursitis may present with erythema and warmth. Radiologic knee series are usually normal. Evaluation with ultrasound will show a hypoechoic fluid filled sac or discrete fluid collection at the site of pain indicating bursitis.
Treatment: The treatment of bursitis-related knee pain is typically focused on reducing the inflammation of the bursa, itself – this includes ice, NSAIDs, activity modifications (such as knee pads for prepatellar bursitis), injections of corticosteroid, and therapeutic aspiration. For patients with active lifestyle or occupational demands and non-septic bursitis, intrabursal injection of corticosteroids provides acute pain relief. If septic bursitis is suspected, infectious workup includes blood sampling for evaluation of leukocytosis and aspiration of bursal fluid with gram stain and cell count. Treat septic bursitis with antibiotics. Recurrent or persistent severe bursitis may benefit from surgical interventions such as bursectomy.

### What are small, medium and large effect sizes for exercise treatments of tendinopathy? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113nta4u]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Background

Tendinopathy is a common musculoskeletal condition associated with degenerative changes and characterised by a combination of pain impaired movement and reduced function that typically requires extended periods for recovery. Tendinopathy can affect any muscle-tendon unit in the body, however, it is most frequently reported in the Achilles, patellar, lateral elbow, rotator cuff and hip tendons. Surveys of prevalence of lower extremity tendinopathy in the general population have reported rates of 11.8 and 10.5 per 1000 person-years, while prevalence for upper limb tendinopathies have been estimated between 1.3% and 21.0%. Costs to the individual, the health service and economy (due to absenteeism and loss of productivity) are substantial such that identifying effective interventions is a priority.

Exercise therapy is the mainstay of conservative management of tendinopathy and has focused largely on resistance training, and in many instances eccentric strengthening techniques. The rationale of exercise therapy is to improve load tolerance and possibly structural adaptation of the musculotendinous unit to restore function. In the early phase of rehabilitation, flexibility exercises are often initiated and incorporated into strengthening regimes to facilitate improvements in mobility. Effective exercise therapy may also require targeting a range of contributing factors, which not only include muscle weakness and decreased flexibility, but also corticospinal and neuromuscular adaptations resulting from persistent pain. As such, proprioceptive exercise interventions have been used to retrain normal patterns of muscle recruitment in the rehabilitation of shoulder-related tendinopathies including impingement. The time course of tendinopathy recovery is usually slow, the degree of recovery may be incomplete and there may be differences between tendinopathies and across outcome domains. For example, quality of life may improve less quickly for people with rotator cuff tendinopathy compared with those with Achilles tendinopathy, whereas recovery may be faster for pain and the relative magnitudes of these improvements may not be equivalent. Quantifying any tendinopathy or domain-specific differences in expected improvements would help guide efforts to develop consensus concerning optimal management by enabling better intervention comparisons.

### Healing of acute anterior cruciate ligament rupture on MRI and outcomes following non-surgical management with the cross bracing protocol [^115692MT]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Adverse events

Two patients were diagnosed with a below knee DVT (before DVT prophylaxis was added to the protocol), which were identified in the second week of the CBP, and were successfully managed with therapeutic dosing of Clexane. Both patients completed the CBP. Follow-up Doppler ultrasound demonstrated complete resolution of the DVT for both patients. Thereafter (11th patient onwards), DVT risk mitigation strategies were deployed as described in the Methods section.

Most patients reported mild and transient discomfort while adapting to the brace during the first week, often citing an awkward or uncomfortable sleeping position with the knee fixed at 90°. This discomfort resolved for all patients without intervention. No patients opted to exit the programme due to discomfort or complication. At the time of unrestricted knee flexion in the brace, a flexion contracture (typically 5°–15°) was observed in 11 patients (14%). This resolved in all patients with physiotherapy exercises within 3 weeks. Contralateral lower limb overuse injuries, including pes anserine bursitis (n = 1), insertional hamstrings tendinopathy (n = 1) and patellofemoral pain (n = 3), were observed at the time of brace removal.

### Distal hamstring injuries and disorders [^112UBEmo]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Hamstring injuries are a common injury sustained by athletes with most injuries occurring as strain injuries within the muscle belly or at the proximal musculotendinous junction. Distal hamstring pathology is relatively uncommon but comprises a collection of both acute and chronic diagnoses that can manifest with symptoms either on the medial or lateral side of the knee based on which hamstring tendons are involved. Pes anserinus bursitis is the most common of these distal hamstring pathologies with other chronic diagnoses, including snapping medial hamstrings or snapping biceps femoris. Acute biceps femoris ruptures can occur in an isolated fashion but most often occur in the setting of concomitant posterolateral corner injury as a result of high-energy trauma. Isolated semitendinosus ruptures can occur with lower-energy acute events, commonly with track and field events. Most distal hamstring pathology can be treated without surgery and do well with conservative treatment. However, acute avulsion injuries often require surgical intervention, as can chronic problems that do not adequately respond to prolonged conservative treatment. Treatment algorithms for distal hamstring injuries are less well-developed than more proximal injuries owing to their lower incidence. This review focuses on distal hamstring injuries, the state of current literature, and treatment strategies.

### Use of musculoskeletal ultrasonography in the diagnosis of pes anserine tendinitis: a case report [^115Jyrw3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

### What are small, medium and large effect sizes for exercise treatments of tendinopathy? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Lt97o]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Data extraction

Data were extracted independently by eight members of the review team (PAS/KC/LA/RM/LG/EP/JSCS/AVP) into preiloted Excel sheets. Data were independently coded as described in the accompanying extraction codebook (online supplemental file 6) by two members from the review team. Differences in entries were detected through automatic checking in MS Excel and then agreed between the same two reviewers. Where pre–post intervention data were not presented in text but in figures, data were extracted using digitsation software (PlotDigitizer V.2.6.8 Windows).

Risk of bias

We used Cochrane's Risk of Bias tooland six outcome domains: (1) selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment), (2) performance bias (blinding of participants), (3) detection bias (blinding of outcome assessors), (4) attrition bias (incomplete outcome data), (5) reporting bias (selective reporting) and (6) other bias, to assess risk of bias for RCTs and domains 2–6 for non-randomised trials. Risk of bias was recorded for each outcome and time point within each study. When obtaining a summary risk of bias for each domain within a study, the mode category across all outcomes and timepoints was selected. The Cochrane's Risk of Bias toolwas selected as a recent review of popular risk of bias tools in tendinopathy management highlighted none were superiorand Cochrane's Risk of Bias tool could be semiautomated with RobotReviewer, a machine learning system software. RobotReviewer was used to make initial assessments on selection bias and performance bias domains, with manual validation made on the relevant free texts extracted to support the final selection of low, high or unclear risk of bias. This semiautomated process was more efficient, and pragmatic given the large number of included studies and provided an additional element of consistency in the review process.

### Ultrasound-guided treatment of extrusive medial meniscopathy: a 3-step protocol [^114szJbF]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Medial knee pain is commonplace in clinical practice and can be related to several pathologic conditions: ie, medial plica syndrome, saphenous nerve entrapment, pes anserine syndrome, medial collateral ligament injury, and medial meniscus disorders. Ultrasound (US) imaging represents a valuable first-line diagnostic approach to adequately visualize the superficial structures in the medial compartment of the knee to easily plan for prompt treatment. Currently, the management of chronic degenerative diseases involving the menisci, and causing their extrusion, consists of surgery (arthroscopic partial meniscectomy). This procedure often allows only a partial resolution of pain and functional impairment. In the pertinent literature, US-guided interventions for the medial meniscus are proposed, mainly to decrease pain and inflammation or to induce regeneration. Likewise, this Technical Innovation describes in detail the US findings of medial extrusive meniscopathy and also illustrates a novel US-guided technique to treat the bursa of the medial collateral ligament, the extruded fragment of the medial meniscus, and the synovial parameniscal recesses simultaneously.

### Injections of the hip and knee [^112YiEY6]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Hip and knee injections are useful diagnostic and therapeutic tools for family physicians. This article reviews anatomic landmark-guided and ultrasound-guided injections and aspiration techniques for greater trochanteric pain syndrome, the hip joint, the knee joint, the pes anserine bursa, and the iliotibial band. Indications for injections include acute and chronic inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis; osteoarthritis; overuse; and traumas. Joint aspirations may be performed to aid in the diagnosis of unexplained effusions and to relieve pain. Technique, injectant, and follow-up timing depend on the physician's comfort, experience, and preference. Infections of the skin or soft tissue are the primary contraindications to injections. The most common complications are local inflammatory reactions to the injectant. These reactions usually cause soreness for 24 to 48 hours, then spontaneously resolve. Follow-up after injections is usually scheduled within two to six weeks.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute pain in austere environments: 2024 update [^114DJefW]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Nonpharmacologic pain management — splinting, bandaging, immobilization, cryotherapy (PRICE) and MEAT: Currently, the protection, relative rest, ice, compression, and elevation (PRICE) protocol is considered the best initial treatment regimen for suspected soft-tissue injury and fractures. Limited evidence supports this practice. However, PRICE remains in widespread use based on moderate-quality evidence and expert opinion. An alternative strategy called the movement, exercise, analgesics, and treatment/therapy (MEAT) protocol has been proposed for managing isolated ligament and tendon injury when fractures have been excluded, and one randomized trial showed that early therapeutic exercise resulted in a quicker return to normal function versus PRICE therapy. If an isolated ligament or tendon injury is highly suspected and fracture is unlikely, MEAT therapy can be substituted, but in an austere environment providers may be unable to differentiate an acute fracture from isolated soft tissue injury; thus, PRICE remains the recommended therapy for most acute musculoskeletal injuries.

### Snapping pes anserine syndrome [^1117sbWP]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

The patient was a 25-year-old man who was serving in the military. He was referred to a physical therapist for a progressively worsening painful snapping sensation in the posteromedial left knee region. Prior magnetic resonance imaging for the left knee was interpreted as normal, except for a mild fluid signal about the left pes anserine bursa. The patient was diagnosed with snapping pes anserine syndrome. However, despite 6 weeks of physical therapist intervention, the patient did not improve. A dynamic real-time ultrasound examination was then ordered, which demonstrated that the pes anserine tendons changed position as the knee moved from flexion to extension, sliding across a heterogeneous rounded mass in the posteromedial knee.

### Management of patellar tendinopathy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised studies [^115grxjc]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

For VISA-P, the intervention with the highest median rank was hyaluronic acid injection+eccentric exercise and that with the lowest median rank was concentric exercise (figure 5B).

Only two comparisons included evidence from both direct and indirect estimates (eccentric exercise versus concentric exercise and ESWT+eccentric exercise versus sham ESWT+eccentric exercise). The results of the network estimates for all comparisons for both pain VAS and VISA-P were of low or very low strength of evidence due to the high overall risk of bias, imprecision and intransitivity; the only results of moderate strength of evidence were the direct estimates of the comparison between ESWT+eccentric exercise and sham ESWT+eccentric exercise presented above in the pairwise meta-analyses.

Mid-term and long-term data were inadequate for NMAs.

### Effectiveness of isometric exercise in the management of tendinopathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^111PEwnW]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Tendinopathy is the preferred term for persistent tendon pain and loss of function due to mechanical loading. The burden of disease associated with tendinopathy is significant, accounting for 30% of all musculoskeletal conditions seen in general practice. It affects both sedentaryand active individuals and is responsible for 30%–50% of all sporting injuries. Both the upper and lower limbs are involved, with the rotator cuff, lateral elbow, gluteal, patellar and Achilles tendons commonly affected.

Exercise programmes are usually the first-line treatment for tendinopathy, and evidence of their effectiveness in reducing pain and improving function has been demonstrated. Different types of exercise or 'loading' programmes have been investigated, with those focusing on eccentric exercises the most commonly researched. However, eccentric loading has not been consistently found to be superior when compared with combined concentric/eccentric programmes. Although the benefits of loading programmes are well recognised, 35%–45% of individuals do not experience a significant reduction in symptoms from either eccentric or combined concentric/eccentric exercise. In contrast to isotonic exercise, in which the tension in the muscle remains constant despite a change in length, the muscle-tendon unit remains at a constant length during isometric exercise. Importantly however, the tendon lengthens when subjected to loading, regardless of muscle contraction type.

There has been recent clinical and research interest in isometric exercise programmes in the management of tendinopathy since the study by Rio and colleagues in 2015. They reported significantly greater pain relief immediately postintervention following a single session of isometric exercise when compared with isotonic exercise in a small sample of volleyball players with patellar tendinopathy. Subsequently, it was proposed that isometric exercise be used at the start of rehabilitation to achieve a reduction in pain. A number of research groups have since investigated the effect of similar isometric loading programmes for pain relief in various tendinopathy populations and reported variable results.

Previous systematic reviews have evaluated eccentric and combined concentric/eccentric programmes, but only one review to date has evaluated isometric exercise. This review focused on patellar tendinopathy and concluded that isometric exercise programmes appeared to be effective in short-term pain relief in athletes during the competitive season. Despite their recent popularity, it is unclear if isometric exercise provides superior pain relief when directly compared with other interventions. Definitive conclusions about the benefits of isometric exercise for tendinopathy can therefore not be made, and no previous systematic reviews have evaluated the effectiveness of isometric exercise in the management of all tendinopathies.

### American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement: interventional musculoskeletal ultrasound in sports medicine [^1173D5dC]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

American Medical Society for Sports Medicine — Accuracy of ultrasound-guided injections (USGIs) versus landmark-guided injections (LMGIs) is stated as: USGIs are more accurate than LMGIs (SORT Evidence Rating = A). Evidence cited indicates that USGIs into large, intermediate, and small joints; tendon sheaths, peritendinous regions, deep gluteal muscles, pes anserinus bursa, sinus tarsi, and inflamed joints are more accurate than LMGIs, while for Morton neuromas and the sacroiliac (SI) joint there are no LMGI accuracy studies and published USGI SI studies conflict, so further research is required. For subacromial-subdeltoid (SA-SD) bursa, studies suggest USG injections are more accurate than LMGIs but reported accuracy rates vary; USGI accuracy depends on the injector correctly identifying and targeting the SA-SD bursa, and heterogeneity in accuracy confirmation methods contributes to interpretation difficulty. A cadaveric shoulder study reported fluoroscopy-estimated accuracy of 90% but actual accuracy of 60%, illustrating that imaging confirmation can misclassify soft-tissue injection accuracy.

### Exercise for posterior tibial tendon dysfunction: a systematic review of randomised clinical trials and clinical guidelines [^114or7WC]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

It was common among included trials for the intervention protocol to include cointerventions such as stretching and orthoses, in addition to specific local strengthening exercises. It is possible that the effect of the local strengthening intervention was affected by these cointerventions. As no randomised trial has looked at local strengthening in isolation (ie, not combined with stretching/orthoses or balance and stretching exercises), it is difficult to ascertain to what degree improvements can be attributed to targeted exercises only. Two trials that investigated stretching, orthoses and local strengthening compared with stretching and orthoses alone showed similar improvement in pain and function in all groups. It is possible that orthoses and/or stretching play a role in the reduction of pain. Future research is required to investigate strength interventions in isolation of other treatments to establish its efficacy in the management of PTTD.

Interestingly, stretching exercises were included in all intervention groups across the three included trials. Both gastrocnemius and soleus stretches were prescribed for 3–10 repetitions of 30 s duration, 2–4 times per day. This stretch is performed in maximal dorsiflexion, which increases the compressive as well as the tensile load on the posterior tibial tendon posterior to the medial malleolus, the combination of which has been found to be most damaging to the tendon. Load management for pain relief in tendinopathy rehabilitation is twofold, incorporating the reduction of both compressive and tensile loads. So while foot orthoses and activity modification may aid in altering tensile loads (supporting the medial longitudinal arch and reducing the torque required from the tibialis posterior during activities), accompanying these interventions with static stretches in full dorsiflexion may be counterproductive to pain management and rehabilitation.

### Treatment algorithms for continuous low-level heat wrap therapy for the management of musculoskeletal pain: an Italian position paper [^113iFnf8]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Superficial Heat Therapy (SHT)

SHT of the knee should be considered in the following cases: muscle spasms (but not tendonitis), overuse pathology, early OA (non-inflammatory phase), and indirect muscle lesions (apply HT post-acute phase resolution). HT can help prevent DOMS. For instance, ice applied to the knee (ie, pes anserine) and heat applied to the thigh are both efficacious treatments for preventing the persistence of spasms caused by tendinopathy. Acute phlebo-lymphological conditions warrant avoiding HT application.

Figure 3 depicts the HT decision algorithm.

Figure 3
A schematic representation of the heat therapy decisional algorithm for knee pain.

Additional non-pharmacological methods, even when combined with HT, may be considered. Physiotherapy should be considered for all the aforementioned conditions; braces may be advantageous for sprains and traumas. Physical activity, weight loss, walking aids, and biomechanical gait correction should be suggested for overuse conditions.

### Exercise parameters to consider for achilles tendinopathy: a modified Delphi study with international experts [^113CLEcA]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Achilles tendinopathy (AT), defined as a 'persistent Achilles tendon pain and loss of function related to mechanical loading', is a relatively common pathology among athletes, but can also occur in a more sedentary population. About 6% of the general population will experience AT at least once in their lifetime, while the incidence rate rises to 24% among elite athletes and to 52% among middle- and long-distance runners. Despite the evolution of treatments, AT remains difficult to manage, with recurrence rates of 23%–43% following rehabilitationand persistent symptoms in up to 60% of patients after 5 years. The natural history of AT is still not fully understood, its pathophysiology is complex and the risk factors are numerous, which makes it difficult to implement a one-size-fits-all strategy. Primary AT management typically involves education, advice and exercises that gradually increase tendon load. These exercises are the cornerstone of rehabilitationand aim to stimulate tendon remodelling, to reduce pain and to improve calf muscle endurance and strength, as well as lower leg function. Thereby, several progressive loading protocols focusing mainly on exercises involving heel raises have been developed, evolving from Stanish and Curwin programmeto Alfredson's eccentric exercises, Silbernagel's combined approachand Heavy-Slow Resistance protocol. Although most of these exercise-based programmes have shown efficacy in improving patients' symptoms, a recent systematic review failed to show clear improvement in muscle structure or function after completing exercise rehabilitation. Even though the impact of exercises is not limited to the modification of muscular properties, this highlights the necessity to refine tendon loading protocols to optimise their effectiveness.

### Effect of resistance exercise dose components for tendinopathy management: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^111ewJTW]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate potential moderating effects of resistance exercise dose components including intensity, volume and frequency, for the management of common tendinopathies.

Design

Systematic review with meta-analysis and meta-regressions.

Data Sources

Including but not limited to: MEDLINE, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, ClinicalTrials.gov and ISRCTN Registry.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Randomised and non-randomised controlled trials investigating resistance exercise as the dominant treatment class, reporting sufficient information regarding ≥ 2 components of exercise dose.

Results

A total of 110 studies were included in meta-analyses (148 treatment arms (TAs), 3953 participants), reporting on five tendinopathy locations (rotator cuff: 48 TAs; Achilles: 43 TAs; lateral elbow: 29 TAs; patellar: 24 TAs; gluteal: 4 TAs). Meta-regressions provided consistent evidence of greater pooled mean effect sizes for higher intensity therapies comprising additional external resistance compared with body mass only (large effect size domains: β BodyMass: External = 0.50 (95% credible interval (CrI): 0.15 to 0.84; p = 0.998); small effect size domains (β BodyMass: External = 0.04 (95% CrI: -0.21 to 0.31; p = 0.619)) when combined across tendinopathy locations or analysed separately. Greater pooled mean effect sizes were also identified for the lowest frequency (less than daily) compared with mid (daily) and high frequencies (more than once per day) for both effect size domains when combined or analysed separately (p ≥ 0.976). Evidence for associations between training volume and pooled mean effect sizes was minimal and inconsistent.

Summary/Conclusion

Resistance exercise dose is poorly reported within tendinopathy management literature. However, this large meta-analysis identified some consistent patterns indicating greater efficacy on average with therapies prescribing higher intensities (through inclusion of additional loads) and lower frequencies, potentially creating stronger stimuli and facilitating adequate recovery.

A prospective randomized cadaveric study has shown that US-guided injections in the pes anserinus bursa are feasible and more accurate than palpation-guided injections. A prospective controlled study comparing US-guided to blind corticosteroid injections into the pes anserinus bursa of patients with bursitis showed that the US-guided injections resulted in greater improvement at 1 and 4 weeks compared to blind injections. Based on review papers, possible interventions in the prepatellar bursa include US-guided corticosteroid injection into an inflamed bursa or aspiration for diagnosis of infection or other synovial pathology. However, no information about efficacy is available. Smith et al. showed 83–100% accuracy of needle placement into the popliteus tendon sheath. Finnoff et al. achieved 92% accuracy in injecting the pes anserinus bursa with US guidance but only 17% accuracy using landmark injections. Jose et al. injected corticosteroid and anesthetic into the medial collateral ligament bursa, while Hong et al. used the same mixture for iliotibial band syndrome. More studies comparing guidance modalities and corticosteroids to other therapies are needed.

### Do we need to improve the reporting of evidence in tendinopathy management? A critical appraisal of systematic reviews with recommendations on strength of evidence assessment [^114dsBcJ]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The ever-expanding arsenal of treatment regimes for tendinopathy can be overwhelming to the treating healthcare professional. New treatments continuously emerge and so do research studies that aim to assess their effectiveness. The most powerful tool that evidence-based medicine has to offer remains systematic reviews (SRs) of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which constitute the highest level of evidence and are therefore often used to inform guidelines and guide clinical practice.

Unlike a narrative review, which is purely a summary of a proportion of (or all) the available studies on a given topic without assessing the quality of the included evidence, an SR is expected to include all the relevant evidence which is comprehensively and thoroughly appraised and presented with qualitative or quantitative syntheses and accompanying strengths of evidence. For reliable, clinically relevant conclusions to be reached, the potential limitations of the included studies need to be considered. What determines the 'quality' of a study remains poorly defined but should relate to the extent to which its design, conduct, analysis and presentation are appropriate to answer its research question. Generally, study quality assessment includes a combined assessment of its internal validity (freedom from bias), external validity (generalisability/applicability) and precision (freedom from random error)(online supplemental figure 1). The Cochrane group, which produce some of the highest quality SRs, recommend emphasising the internal validity when assessing the quality of a study, reflected by the risk-of-bias assessment (RoB) tool they have produced. However, external validity and precision should not be overlooked.

Assessing the strength of evidence (also known as 'certainty', 'quality', 'level' or 'grade' of evidence) is closely interlinked with RoB assessment and is a process which is commonly overlooked by many SRs. Together with a meticulous methodology and comprehensive RoB assessment, this is what distinguishes a SR from other types of review articles. Assigning a strength of evidence to a finding is as important as the finding itself. Strength of evidence should accompany every assessed outcome measure within an SR for every assessed follow-up time period. A result with a low strength of evidence differs substantially from that with a high level of evidence in terms of its applicability to clinical practice; further research is likely to change the former but not the latter. Equally, the strength of evidence can be high in an outcome measure and low in another, and high for a certain follow-up but period and low for another.

### Mesotherapy in the treatment of musculoskeletal pain in rehabilitation: the state of the art [^112ghRTA]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The data respect this systematic review suggest that mesotherapy can be recommended in the rehabilitation treatment of musculoskeletal pain. In summary, mesotherapy showed good results in reducing pain and improving function in musculoskeletal pain disorders of the spine (neck pain and low nack pain): the best result is obtained in acute pain compared to chronic pain.

Yang et aland Cui et alperformed a single mesotherapy session in acute musculoskeletal pain (neck and low back pain), with acceptable pain control and rapid recovery of function. Instead, in chronic musculoskeletal pain were dosed 3 or 5 mesotherapy sessions. Mesotherapy has found limited use but with good results even in knee pain: Saggini et aladministered 9 sessions of mesotherapy (3 times per week) for pes anserine bursitis.

In conclusion, mesotherapy could be a good option in rehabilitation field for musculoskeletal pain with good advantages and few or no side effects. Future randomized controlled trials should be desirable for have more uniform treatment protocols.

### Eccentric or concentric exercises for the treatment of tendinopathies? [^113sb3Pe]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Synopsis Tendinopathy is a very common disorder in both recreational and elite athletes. Many individuals have recurrent symptoms that lead to chronic conditions and termination of sports activity. Exercise has become a popular and somewhat efficacious treatment regime, and isolated eccentric exercise has been particularly promoted. In this clinical commentary, we review the relevant evidence for different exercise regimes in tendinopathy rehabilitation, with particular focus on the applied loads that are experienced by the tendon and how the exercise regime may affect these applied loads. There is no convincing clinical evidence to demonstrate that isolated eccentric loading exercise improves clinical outcomes more than other loading therapies. However, the great variation and sometimes insufficient reporting of the details of treatment protocols may hamper the interpretation of what may be the optimal exercise regime with respect to parameters such as load magnitude, speed of movement, and recovery period between exercise sessions. Future studies should control for these loading parameters, evaluate various exercise dosages, and think beyond isolated eccentric exercises to arrive at firm recommendations regarding rehabilitation of individuals with tendinopathies.

### Eccentric exercises; why do they work, what are the problems and how can we improve them? [^1158KW7n]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Eccentric exercises (EE) have proved successful in the management of chronic tendinopathy, particularly of the Achilles and patellar tendons, where they have been shown to be effective in controlled trials. However, numerous questions regarding EE remain. The standard protocols are time-consuming and require very motivated patients. EE are effective in some tendinopathies but not others. Furthermore, the location of the lesion can have a profound effect on efficacy; for example, standard EE in insertional lesions of the Achilles are ineffective. Until recently little was known of the effect of EE on tendinopathic tendons, although a greater understanding of this process is emerging. Additionally, recent in vivo evidence directly comparing eccentric and concentric exercises provides a possible explanation for the therapeutic benefit of EE. The challenge now is to make EE more effective. Suggestions on areas of future research are made.

### Clinical indications for image-guided interventional procedures in the musculoskeletal system: a Delphi-based consensus paper from the European society of musculoskeletal radiology (ESSR)-part V, knee [^112C6C2V]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We found some evidence concerning image-guided procedures around the knee. In all statements, US guidance has been established as pivotal, as accuracy and clinical outcome are generally higher compared to palpation-guided procedures with the highest level of evidence (statement #1). Moreover, US-guided injection of corticosteroid-anesthetic has proven to be effective in the short-to-midterm follow-up for treating inflammatory arthritis with a level of evidence 2 (statement #2). Conversely, despite being seemingly safe and effective in treating osteoarthritis, strong evidence is still lacking for US-guided injections of HA (statement #3) and regenerative medications (statement #4). Furthermore, only small case series are available for US-guided procedures around the menisci and injections and alcohol ablation in knee anterior fat pad–related syndromes, reporting promising results that require to be further confirmed by larger series.

Regarding periarticular treatments, PT is the most investigated topic. According to our results, US-guided dry needling is highly effective in PT with a higher level of evidence (statement #7). Notably, although the association of PRP to dry needling seems to improve the outcome, there are still conflicting results concerning the value of PRP alone for PT, leading us to recommend avoiding this treatment as a first-line strategy. Although different safe and effective US-guided treatment options exist, no randomized prospective studies have effectively clarified which one should be preferred as the best choice (statement #8). Last, US-guided treatments of Baker's cyst (statement #9) and pes anserinus bursitis (statement #10) are both safe and effective, but the level of evidence of these procedures is still too low to strongly recommend these treatments.

In summary, ten statements regarding US-guided musculoskeletal interventions around the knee have been provided by a working group of experts from the ESSR. US guidance is strongly recommended for intra-articular and PT procedures to ensure higher accuracy and efficacy. Prospective randomized studies remain warranted, especially for knee procedures with low levels of evidence.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic injection of the hip and knee [^117UDdW2]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Joint injection of the hip and knee regions is a useful diagnostic and therapeutic tool for the family physician. In this article, the injection procedure for the greater trochanteric bursa, the knee joint, the pes anserine bursa, the iliotibial band, and the prepatellar bursa is reviewed. Indications for greater trochanteric bursa injection include acute and chronic inflammation associated with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, repetitive use, and other traumatic injuries to the area. For the knee joint, aspiration may be performed to aid in the diagnosis of an unexplained effusion and relieve discomfort caused by an effusion. Injection of the knee can be performed for viscosupplementation or corticosteroid therapy. Indications for corticosteroid injection include advanced osteoarthritis and other inflammatory arthritides, such as gout or calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease. Swelling and tenderness of pes anserine or prepatellar bursae can be relieved with aspiration and corticosteroid injection. Persistent pain and disability from iliotibial band syndrome respond to local injection therapy. The proper technique, choice and quantity of pharmaceuticals, and appropriate follow-up are essential for effective outcomes.

### Mesotherapy in the treatment of musculoskeletal pain in rehabilitation: the state of the art [^111gVqZ6]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The evaluation scales were administered before mesotherapy treatment and at the follow-up times 30, 60 and 90 days after the last treatment.

The authors concluded that mesotherapy is effective and safe, yielding the same results as conventional therapy but with minor adverse effects. The efficacy of mesotherapy has been demonstrated by echographic evaluation: higher drug concentrations in the subcutaneous tissue have local effects near inflammatory cells, sensory fibers, and vascular mediators that orchestrate inflammation and pain.

The 2 studies, that assessed the effectiveness of mesotherapy for knee pain could not be compared because they used different protocols (eg, with regard to pharmacological dosage and times of administration). Also, 1 study concerned a specific condition in knee pain (pes anserine bursitis).

The drugs that are administered through mesotherapy have different pharmacokinetic (distribution and diffusion) onset, and duration before and after activity, based on the site of injection. Intradermal therapy with NSAIDs or other drugs increases their concentration in the targeted region (skin, tendon and muscle) compared with intramuscular administration. This effect has been confirmed by the immunogenic effect of tetanus toxoid after intradermal or intramuscular administration.NSAIDs act through COX inhibition and the consequent reduction in the levels of prostaglandin and other inflammatory mediators. In addition, nitric oxide levels are higher, enhancing the peripheral antinociception effect. The sodium channel blocker, lidocaine, is often used in association with NSAIDs, and its pain-relieving effects appear to be related to the generation of ectopic activity in afferent neurons without conduction block an effect that decreases ongoing and evoked neuropathic pain. By local application, the depressive effects of lidocaine are greater in A-fibers than in C-fibers in muscle cutaneous afferents.

Clinical practice guidelines for the management of osteoarthritis recommend pharmacological and no pharmacological approaches in knee OA. Oral drugs provide the best benefits in improving pain but induce adverse effects, such as renal dysfunction and gastrointestinal toxicity, especially in patients with such co-morbidities as cardiovascular disease.

### Medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction is superior to active rehabilitation in protecting against further patella dislocations [^116Z4dsx]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Reconstruction group (MPFL)

An open MPFL-reconstruction with a semitendinosus graft according to a procedure modified from Deie et al. was performed (Fig. 1). Semitendinosus was harvested through a standard small incision. The tendon insertion at the pes anserinus was kept. The graft was then transferred to, and flipped around the femoral insertion of the adductor tendon at the adductor tubercle and fixed with two sutures via a small separate incision, before tunnelling the tendon up to the proximal 1/3 of the patella. The graft was weaved and sutured into the periosteum on the anterior of the patella from the medial to lateral while the knee was flexed approximately at 30 degrees. Hence, no bone tunnels were used. This technique ensured that all age groups in the trial could be offered the same surgical treatment. The surgery was performed by at least one of four knee consultants trained in this procedure.

The ST (semitendinosus) graft is left fixed at the tibia insertion, flipped under the adductor tendon and weaved into the periosteum of the patella at 30 degrees of knee flexion. MCL medial collateral ligament, AT adductor tendon, MPFL medial patellofemoral ligament, P patella, VMO vastus medialis oblique

Weight bearing on straight leg was allowed from day one and the patients were instructed to start passive range of motion (ROM) up to 90 degrees of flexion and to practise straight leg raise and quadriceps contractions. After 8 weeks they were instructed to start the same active rehabilitation as the Control group.

Physiotherapy group (control)

A physiotherapist in our orthopaedic department instructed the patient and provided a home exercise programme and a referral to an external physiotherapist for follow-up (Online Appendix). The training program focused on strengthening of the vastus medialis oblique (VMO), stretching exercises for the hamstrings and neuromuscular balance of the knee. Patellar brace or Mc Connell patellar taping was recommended for the first year in high-risk situations.

Follow up

All patients visited a designated study physiotherapist 3 and 6 months after arthroscopy/reconstruction to assess pain, ROM, apprehension to lateralization of the patella and to ensure that every patient was followed up by a local physiotherapist. After 12 months the patients underwent a clinical assessment by the surgeon and the PROMs were repeated.

### Evaluation of patients presenting with knee pain: part II. differential diagnosis [^112CRL3g]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Knee pain is a common presenting complaint with many possible causes. An awareness of certain patterns can help the family physician identify the underlying cause more efficiently. Teenage girls and young women are more likely to have patellar tracking problems such as patellar subluxation and patellofemoral pain syndrome, whereas teenage boys and young men are more likely to have knee extensor mechanism problems such as tibial apophysitis (Osgood-Schlatter lesion) and patellar tendonitis. Referred pain resulting from hip joint pathology, such as slipped capital femoral epiphysis, also may cause knee pain. Active patients are more likely to have acute ligamentous sprains and overuse injuries such as pes anserine bursitis and medial plica syndrome. Trauma may result in acute ligamentous rupture or fracture, leading to acute knee joint swelling and hemarthrosis. Septic arthritis may develop in patients of any age, but crystal-induced inflammatory arthropathy is more likely in adults. Osteoarthritis of the knee joint is common in older adults.

### Education plus exercise versus corticosteroid injection use versus a wait and see approach on global outcome and pain from gluteal tendinopathy: prospective, single blinded, randomised clinical trial [^113LGUrE]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Gluteal tendinopathy, often referred to as greater trochanteric bursitis or greater trochanteric pain syndrome, has a prevalence of 10–25% and is experienced by one in four women aged over 50 years. The disorder presents as pain and tenderness over the greater trochanter and often interferes with sleep and physical function. The level of disability and quality of life is equivalent to that of severe hip osteoarthritis, and effective management strategies are required.

Corticosteroid injections are commonly used to manage gluteal tendinopathy and although early outcomes are promising, medium term benefits are significantly less so, and long term outcomes are no better than a wait and see approach. A contemporary approach to managing other tendinopathies combines education to reduce load on the tendon during sustained postures and function (that is, load management) with exercisesthat target the underlying pathology. This approach has not been tested in randomised clinical trials for gluteal tendinopathy. One non-randomised clinical trial compared a home exercise programme with corticosteroid injection use and radial shock wave treatment, reporting that home exercise performed poorly by comparison at one and four months. Load management advice was not provided and exercise was not specific to the involved gluteal tendons and muscles.

We conducted a randomised clinical trial to compare the effects of a programme of education about tendon load management plus specific exercise, a single corticosteroid injection, and a wait and see approach on pain and global improvement in individuals with gluteal tendinopathy. The hypothesis was that both education plus exercise and corticosteroid injection use would be better than a wait and see approach in the short term (after eight weeks), whereas education plus exercise would be better than corticosteroid injection use in the longer term (after 52 weeks).

### Exercise for posterior tibial tendon dysfunction: a systematic review of randomised clinical trials and clinical guidelines [^111To715]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review was performed using a predetermined protocol in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. It was registered with PROSPERO (trial registration number CRD42017076156) and is available at.

Search strategy and data sources

To answer the research question about the treatment effects of local strengthening exercises for PTTD, four electronic databases (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane, Embase and PubMed) were searched from inception to June 2018 for full-text papers published in peer-reviewed journals. A comprehensive search strategy was developed to capture variations in terminology used in the literature for PTTD and key conservative interventions (online supplementary table 1). No further limits were applied to the initial search strategy. Reference list checks and author searches were also performed to ensure all relevant literature was identified.

Eligibility criteria

Eligibility criteria were determined prospectively using the patient, intervention, comparator and outcome (PICO) framework. Trials were eligible for inclusion if they investigated individuals with PTTD or adult-acquired flatfoot deformity due to PTTD, if they were randomised, and if local strengthening was compared with other forms of conservative management with respect to pain, function and/or physical impairment outcome measures. A diagnosis of PTTD was required to be made based on a minimal list of diagnostic criteria, with two or more of the following: tenderness on palpation of the posterior tibial tendon, pain and/or swelling along the posterior tibial tendon, medial foot pain, difficulty and/or pain with single leg heel raise, and inability to invert the calcaneus on double leg heel raise. Flatfoot deformity was not considered as a selection criterion and as such all stages of PTTD were included.

Trials were excluded if they compared surgical interventions for PTTD, did not include a comparator group and combined data for individuals diagnosed with conditions other than PTTD. Reviews, case studies and trials for paediatric flatfoot, asymptomatic flatfoot, neurological conditions and rheumatoid arthritis were also excluded.

Study selection

The lead reviewer (MHR) performed the search and exported all retrieved records into EndNote V.X7 (Thompson Reuters, Carlsbad, California, USA). Duplicates were removed and titles and abstracts were screened independently by two reviewers (MHR and RM), based on established eligibility criteria. Full texts were retrieved for all potentially eligible papers and reviewed for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Where there were uncertainties, at least one additional author (MDS or BV) was consulted to determine final eligibility.

### Management of patellar tendinopathy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised studies [^111PxgcH]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

Based on our findings and those of previously published systematic reviews, we recommend against the use of ESWT or concentric exercise monotherapy to manage patellar tendinopathy. Eccentric loading should continue to be used as first-line treatment and isometric loading, which may be as effective for immediate pain relief (low strength of evidence), may be preferable in select cases. However, its mid-term and long-term effects remain unknown. Heavy or moderate slow resistance exercise also appears effective and could be used instead of or in combination with eccentric exercise, although its effectiveness is only based on limited evidence. Topical GTN and/or hyaluronic acid injections could be considered adjuncts at 12 weeks if loading regimes alone have been ineffective. Finally, eccentric loading should continue to be assessed as monotherapy in future research.

### Enhancing current guidance for psoriatic arthritis and its comorbidities: recommendations from an expert consensus panel [^111v4TxY]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Management

Recommendations (Table 4) and implications for clinical practice (Table 5) within management cover the benefits of early intervention, lifestyle modifications, treating to target and the risks associated with the use of CSs. Guidance on pharmacological therapies is given in extant guidelines and is outside the scope of this work.

Regarding therapy initiation and goal setting, early intervention was agreed to be of paramount importance, which may include management in early arthritis clinics and assessment for subclinical enthesitis. Patients with PsA are presenting later and receiving less therapy than patients with RA, and delay in presentation has been associated with poorer outcomes. A thorough early assessment is advised, since in early PsA the extent and severity of disease can be underestimated, particularly in polyarticular disease. It has been observed that the disease phenotype can worsen over time; thus, early therapy may alter the disease course (though data are lacking). Preliminary evidence indicates early biologic treatment of PsO may delay PsA onset, although the findings on this are conflicting, highlighting the need for additional population-based research.

Lifestyle factors can play a key role in PsA management. Smoking cessation is strongly recommended, in alignment with guidance provided by BSR. There is evidence that exercise is linked to a reduced risk of PsA, and that patients with PsA can tolerate high-intensity training without worsening of disease activity, despite persisting concerns around mechanical stress triggering an inflammatory response or enthesitis. However, there is a lack of evidence to support the recommendation of specific types of exercise, and given that patients may be unsure what is safe for them, exercise regimens should be tailored to the individual, and their current fitness level and degree of disease activity.

For disease activity and therapy monitoring, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were regarded by the SC as useful to include alongside standard clinical assessments. These can be collected digitally, but must reflect the individual and local need in terms of usability, language and health literacy. A treat-to-target model incorporating PROMs of significance to the individual forms the backbone of recommendations in this theme (Table 4).

Data extraction

Following extraction training, data were extracted independently by eight members of the review team (PAS/KC/LA/RM/LG/EP/JSCS/AVP) into prepiloted excel spreadsheets and independently coded as described in the accompanying extraction codebook (online supplemental file 5). Each entry on the spreadsheet was double-checked by a different member of the team. Where pre-post intervention data were not presented in text but in figures, data were extracted using PlotDigitizer V.2.6.8 Windows (WebPlotDigitizer - Copyright 2010–2021 Ankit Rohatgi).

Risk of bias assessment

Risk of bias was assessed using the earlier version of the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB) toolsince a recent review of RoB tools in tendinopathy management studies did not identify one tool as being superior to the others. Furthermore, it allowed us to streamline the process by combining with RobotReviewer, a machine learning software that semi-automates the Cochrane tool. A risk of bias judgement was made for each outcome and time point within studies for each of the seven domainsand reported as either 'low risk', 'high risk' or 'uncertain' when there was insufficient detail or the outcome was not addressed. RobotReviewer was used to make initial assessments on domains 1, 2 and 3 and validated manually using the extracted free text to agree on a final selection of risk of bias. This semi-automated process provided greater efficiency and consistency during the review process. Results are presented using an overall summary risk of bias assessment, obtained for each domain by selecting the mode risk category across all outcomes and time points. An assessment was made by any two members of the team (AVP, JSCS, RM, EP, LG] with comments made to justify scoring and regular consultation between team members where uncertainties arose.

### Distal gracilis tear in an equestrian [^117AzCEq]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

A 61-yr-old female equestrian presented after 2 wks of left medial thigh pain, which developed suddenly while exiting a car. She denied any history of recent trauma or falls. On examination, she was found to have tenderness at the left distal medial thigh with a palpable region of decreased tissue volume at the gracilis myotendinous junction. Point-of-care ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed a high-grade partial thickness tear of the left distal gracilis at the myotendinous junction, as well as pes anserine bursal distention. She received physical therapy and underwent a 1-time ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection to the left pes anserine bursa. At follow-up, her symptoms had significantly improved, and she had returned to horseback riding after 12 wks. Isolated gracilis myotendinous tear is a rare condition, and this is a unique case with an atypical mechanism of injury as gracilis injuries have only been reported during vigorous exercise-related activities rather than transitional movements. This case illustrates the potential increased risk of distal gracilis injury after repetitive corticosteroid injections (genicular nerve blocks and radiofrequency lesioning) in a patient who was also likely predisposed to gracilis microtrauma due to her equestrian activities. Gracilis injury should be considered in the differential diagnosis of distal medial thigh pain, especially in cases with similar interventional and recreational profiles.

Discussion

Item 23c: discussion

Discuss any limitations of the review processes used; comment on the potential impact of each limitation.

Example: 'We planned threshold analysis as a quantitative means to assess the robustness of network meta-analysis recommendations to potential limitations in the evidence. We were unable to use this approach because of substantial overlap in credible intervals from the network meta-analysis. Due to overlap in the intervals, no recommendations could be made, which is a fundamental prerequisite to performing a valid threshold analysis. To comply with our protocol, we report threshold results in (supplementary Web appendix), but chose to use GRADE to interpret the evidence. We were not able to evaluate small study bias due to too low number of trials. We found three completed trials in trial registers; two are under review, and the publication status of one trial is unknown'.
Discussion

Item 23d: discussion

Discuss implications of the results for practice, policy, and make recommendations for future research.

Example: 'On average, patients with subacromial pain syndrome reported reduced pain, and improved physical function and quality of life following both surgical and non-surgical treatment. However, at up to 5 years, irrespective of treatment, patients continued to report pain of an average of 1.5–3 on a scale of 0–10 points on a Visual Analogue Scale. Clinicians working in primary care who are treating patients with subacromial pain syndrome should be aware that some patients experience prolonged symptoms and consider care strategies to support coping.

A placebo control helps answer the research question 'is there a benefit of subacromial decompression surgery?' because it minimises the risk of detection and performance biases. Both sources of bias contribute to overestimation of treatment effects by up to 20%. The largely consistent findings of the unblinded studies leave little doubt of the inference that subacromial decompression surgery provides no important benefit to patients. The current evidence provides no support for subacromial decompression surgery as an intervention providing important benefit for patients with subacromial pain syndrome. High-quality evidence indicates that surgery versus placebo surgery confers no important benefit on pain and function — the outcomes most important to patients. Considering the body of evidence, further head-to-head comparisons of subacromial decompression surgery compared with placebo surgery or non-surgical management with the same population are unlikely to change the results. Policymakers, funders and clinicians should consider these results in their funding and clinical decisions regarding the management of patients with shoulder pain.

### Ultrasound-guided pes anserine bursitis injection choices: prolotherapy or oxygen-ozone or corticosteroid: a randomized multicenter clinical trial [^116dpWRe]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Pes anserine bursitis is the most common cause of periarticular knee pain. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of local injection-based therapies with different materials.

Design

The enrolled patients were randomly allocated to three groups to receive different interventions. Outcome measures included pain severity using the visual analog scale and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index that was evaluated before the intervention, 1 and 8 wks after that.

Results

This trial was performed on 72 participants, with male-to-female ratio of 0.14 and with a mean age of 61.49 ± 9.35 yrs. Corticosteroids in the first group, oxygen-ozone in the second group, and dextrose 20% in the third group, were injected into the pes anserine bursa under ultrasound guidance. Interaction between time and group showed a statistically significant improvement in visual analog scale and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (P ≤ 0.05) in favor of corticosteroids and oxygen-ozone groups after 1 wk and in favor of oxygen-ozone and prolotherapy groups after 8 wks.

Conclusions

All three treatment options are effective for patients with pes anserine bursitis. This study showed that the effects of oxygen-ozone injection and prolotherapy last longer than those of corticosteroid injection.

### Isometric versus isotonic exercise for greater trochanteric pain syndrome: a randomised controlled pilot study [^113DszTf]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) encompasses a number of conditions which can cause pain around the greater trochanter of the femur. The pathology primarily involves the gluteus medius and minimus tendons and less frequently the trochanteric bursa. Gluteal tendinopathy is the most common tendon pathology affecting the lower limb in a primary care population with incidence being as high as 24% in females and 9% in males aged 50–79 years. Sleep, sick leave and participation in sport are impacted with quality of life scores similar to those with severe hip osteoarthritis.

Despite its prevalence and influence on quality of life, only three studies have investigated the effectiveness of an exercise programme for the management of GTPS. In one study, a 12-week programme of hip stretching and strengthening exercises was compared with shock wave therapy and a corticosteroid injection. Exercise was shown to be less effective after 1 month, but more beneficial at 15 months. Recently, a progressive lower limb exercise programme for the gluteal, quadriceps and calf muscles was compared with sham exercise in postmenopausal females with GTPS. Both groups also received education and similar improvements were observed at 52 weeks. A randomised controlled trial of 204 participants with gluteal tendinopathy found that education plus a progressive exercise programme targeting the gluteal muscles was superior to both a corticosteroid injection and 'wait and see' approach at 8 and 52 weeks.

Isometric exercises have gained popularity in recent years in the management of other lower limb tendinopathies. An isometric exercise programme was compared with an isotonic programme in Australian volleyball and basketball players with patella tendinopathy. Both programmes were equally effective after 4 weeks in reducing pain and improving function, possibly indicating that the specific muscle contraction type may be less important than the loading intensity. Furthermore, a systematic review examining tendon adaptation in response to exercise concluded that loading magnitude and muscle contraction intensity was more important than muscle contraction type.

Exercise is currently the first-line treatment for tendinopathy and at least 12 weeks of progressive loading is recommended. However, a recent review noted the lack of consensus around exercise and rehabilitation protocols for GTPS. Isometric and isotonic exercise programmes have not been directly compared for GTPS and it is unclear whether the improvements observed in other lower limb tendinopathies could be replicated in GTPS.

### Effect of resistance exercise dose components for tendinopathy management: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^111mZibu]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This review was part of a project funded by the National Institute for Health Research (Health Technology Assessment 129388 Exercise therapy for the treatment of tendinopathies) and adhered to an a priori protocol (PROSPERO 2020 CRD42020168187).

Inclusion criteria

Inclusion criteria and methods were influenced by the project aims, the results of an initial scoping reviewand two subsequent stakeholder workshops (n = 13). The first included nine individuals who delivered exercise therapy for tendinopathy and had an academic interest. The second included four women with lived experience. Finally, an online survey (n = 26) was conducted to gather the views of a more diverse international sample of purposefully selected clinicians and academics. A completed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis checklist for reporting of systematic reviews can be found in online supplemental file 1. The inclusion criteria were framed according to a modified PICOS (participant, intervention, comparator, outcomes, study type) approach which also included context.

Participants

This meta-analysis included people of any age or gender with a diagnosis of RCRSP, lateral elbow, patellar, Achilles or gluteal tendinopathy of any severity or duration. Due to difficulty in diagnosing the patho-anatomical cause of shoulder painthe term RCRSP is defined here as pain, impaired movement and function of the shoulder from one or more structures (encompassing subacromial pain/impingement syndrome (SIS), rotator cuff tendinopathy and subacromial bursitis). We included studies that described participants as having tendinopathy, SIS or RCRSP, thereby acknowledging that participants may have tendinopathy+/−involvement of other structures. Full thickness or large tears were excluded, for all tendinopathies. Trial authors' diagnoses were accepted where a clearly verifiable group of clinical features was reported including: pathognomonic location of pain; a symptom altering response to applied load and/or stretch, with there being a specific test for most tendinopathies; strategies to rule out differential diagnoses; ultrasound or MRI confirmation of structural change. Typically, a minimum of two clinical features were acceptable, however often more were reported. Data from studies with mixed groups were included where there was clear reporting of the tendinopathic group, or they comprised > 90% of the investigated cohort.

### Non-invasive and minimally invasive management of low back disorders [^116C6eQh]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Lumbar manipulation and mobilization — there are one high-quality and 36 moderate-quality RCTs incorporated into this analysis; the highest quality sham-manipulation trial suggested no benefits, and a clinical prediction rule (CPR) appeared quite promising, yet was unable to be validated. Manipulation or mobilization of the lumbar spine is Recommended (I), Low Confidence for select treatment of acute or subacute LBP, or radicular pain syndromes without neurological deficit. Patient preference is an indication for early use of manipulation. Manipulation may also be considered for treatment of severe, acute LBP concurrent with directional exercise, aerobic exercise, and NSAIDs. Objective improvements should be shown approximately halfway through the regimen to continue a treatment course. There is no quality evidence that more than 12 visits are helpful for an episode of LBP, thus ongoing manipulation is not indicated. Manipulation or mobilization for short-term relief of chronic pain while used as a component of an active exercise program is also Recommended (C), Low Confidence.

### Shedding light on the non-operative treatment of the forgotten side of the knee: rehabilitation of medial collateral ligament injuries-a systematic review [^112EeU4w]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Isolated MCL injuries are primarily treated non-surgically, including physiotherapeutic intervention in rehabilitation and exercise therapy. The non-surgical treatment of most isolated injuries is logical, as the deep part of the MCL has historically been described as having good self-healing capacity because it is related to the joint capsule. Recent advances in clinical practice have suggested that the location of the MCL injury better explains why some MCL injuries heal well. In contrast, femoral MCL injuries tend to do well unless there is an avulsion off the bone, while tibial injuries can be more problematic. As part of the non-surgical treatment of isolated MCL injuries, typically grade II or III, a hinged brace can protect the knee from further valgus stress. Some injuries may, however, be recommended for acute surgery: grade III isolated MCL tears in athletes, with medial joint opening in full extension with valgus applied, or a tibial avulsion with the MCL folded into the medial joint, or a Stener lesion with the MCL lying superficial to the pes anserine tendons; or a positive dial test indicating anteromedial rotatory instability. Following the failure of non-surgical treatment, a patient may experience persistent symptoms and/or activity limitations, and surgical treatment may be considered. Despite the practice of non-surgical treatment for most isolated MCL injuries, the evidence regarding the structure and content of rehabilitation is limited. In addition, there is no aggregated evidence on the outcome of non-surgical treatment after MCL injury. Therefore, this study systematically reviewed the current literature regarding the non-surgical treatment of isolated MCL injuries. A secondary objective was to investigate surgical and non-surgical treatment outcomes for MCL injuries.

### An exercise programme for the management of lateral elbow tendinopathy [^113n8H24]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Home exercise programmes and exercise programmes carried out in a clinical setting are commonly advocated for the treatment of lateral elbow tendinopathy (LET), a very common lesion of the arm with a well-defined clinical presentation. The aim of this study is to describe the use and effects of strengthening and stretching exercise programmes in the treatment of LET.

Eccentric Exercises

Slow progressive eccentric exercises for LET should be performed with the elbow in extension, forearm in pronation, and wrist in extended position (as high as possible). However, it is unclear how the injured tendon, which is loaded eccentrically, returns to the starting position without experiencing concentric loading and how the "slowness" of eccentric exercises should be defined. Nor has the treatment regimen of the eccentric exercises of a supervised exercise programme been defined.

Stretching Exercises

Static stretching is defined as passively stretching a given muscle-tendon unit by slowly placing and maintaining it in a maximal position of stretch. We recommend the position should be held for 30–45 s, three times before and three times after eccentric exercises during each treatment session with a 30 s rest interval between each procedure. The treatment region of static stretching exercises when a supervised exercise programme is performed is unknown.

Discussion

A well designed trial is needed to study the effectiveness of a supervised exercise programme for LET consisting of eccentric and static stretching exercises. The issues relating to the supervised exercise programme should be defined so that therapists can replicate the programme.

### Conservative interventions for managing exercise-related musculoskeletal groin pain [^11459iQu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Certainty of the evidence assessment

Two review authors (APPS and AJSO) will independently assess the certainty of the evidence following the GRADE approach, as described in Chapter 14 of the Cochrane Handbook. In case of disagreement, a third review author (LH) will be consulted to reach consensus.

The assessment will consider five domains: (1) risk of bias (limitations in study design and implementation); (2) inconsistency (variability in results across studies); (3) indirectness (applicability of the evidence to the research question); (4) imprecision (statistical uncertainty or small sample sizes); (5) publication bias (potential selective reporting of results). We will classify the certainty of the evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low. The certainty starts as high when the evidence is supported by well‐conducted RCTs, and is downgraded by one or two levels, depending on the extent of concerns in each domain. We will document our justifications for any downgrading, and consider them in the interpretation of our findings.

To present the findings clearly, we will construct summary of findings (SoF) tables for these main comparisons.

Conservative intervention (single or multimodal) versus no or minimal intervention
Conservative intervention (single or multimodal) versus placebo or sham intervention
Comparison between two conservative interventions (single or multimodal)

Each SoF table will include:

The population, intervention, comparison, and key outcomes (pain, function, quality of life, and return to sports) at the intermediate‐term time point (≥ 12 weeks, no later than six months after the end of the treatment)
Relative or absolute effect estimates, or both
Number of participants and included studies
Certainty of the evidence, based on GRADE criteria
Explanatory footnotes when necessary

We will use GRADEpro GDT software to create these tables and ensure transparency in the assessment process.

Consumer involvement

Consumers will not be involved in this review due to limited resources. This systematic review did not receive any specific funding from public, commercial, or not‐for‐profit organizations.

### Distal hamstring injuries and disorders [^1118XWre]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic Medial Distal Hamstring Pathologies

The pes anserine is the confluence of the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus tendons at their attachment site on the proximal, medial tibia. A small bursa is located between the tendons and the medial tibial to help control friction as the tendons glide over the medial tibia. Mechanical derangement, direct trauma, obesity, and overuse have all been implicated in developing pes anserine bursitis; it is also more commonly found in females than males and in patients who already have evidence of knee osteoarthritis. – Regardless of the mechanism, inflammation of this bursa or the tendons can lead to pes anserine bursitis. Patients with this condition will typically present with medial sided knee pain, which will be provoked by climbing or descending stairs, moving from a seated to standing position, and other activities requiring active knee flexion. Often, patients will describe weakness and decreased range of motion with knee flexion. One of the key findings is tenderness over the insertion of the pes anserine tendons. A described physical examination maneuver for detecting pes anserinus bursitis involves testing resisted knee flexion while the leg is positioned in external rotation, with reproduction of pain denoting a positive test. The diagnosis of pes anserine bursitis is largely a clinical diagnosis, with the combination of the above findings. Imaging studies, such as radiograph, ultrasonography, and MRI typically are not used to definitively diagnose this condition. However, they can be helpful in ruling out other conditions for cases that are unclear. In addition, it is important that the treating provider remember that the differential diagnosis for pes anserine bursitis can include infection to the area, gout, medial meniscus pathology, L3/L4 radiculopathy, medial collateral ligament injuries, and various cysts, ganglions, or masses around the knee. Treatment for pes anserine bursitis can include rest, ice, NSAIDs, weight loss, physical therapy, and steroid injection. Physical therapy protocols emphasize strengthening of adductor and quadriceps muscle groups, particularly in the terminal 30° of extension, in addition to stretching of the pes anserine tendons. Surgical intervention is usually not needed for treatment, but bursa irrigation and drainage, bursal excision, and treatment of concomitant or inciting pathology are described in the literature.

### Exercise for posterior tibial tendon dysfunction: a systematic review of randomised clinical trials and clinical guidelines [^116iE8Eo]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review evaluated pain and functional outcomes following local strengthening exercise in individuals with PTTD. Two main findings emanate from this systematic review: the first is the lack of rigorous RCTs investigating the effects of non-surgical management on impairments, activity limitations and participation in adults with PTTD, and the second is that exercise parameters are poorly reported.

Detailed reporting of exercise parameters for musculoskeletal interventions trialled in RCTs is essential for clinical replication and translation of research into practice. The implications of omitting important exercise parameters in reporting, however, extend beyond just clinical replication of exercise prescription. Exercise parameters such as time under tension, range of motion and rest or recovery time can be manipulated and are expected to influence both physiological response to and efficacy of the exercise prescription, meaning that slight variations in prescription parameters may have vastly different physiological effects. Factors related to biophysical response to exercise were not sufficiently described in the included studies, and strengthening interventions failed to improve strength-related outcome measures at both 6 and 12 weeks. Lack of detailed reporting becomes an important matter when a primary goal in rehabilitation of tendinopathies is to improve the load management capacity of the musculotendinous unit.

Current literature implicates appropriate load management as the most important component of rehabilitation for tendinopathies. The benefit of therapeutic exercise in the management of lateral epicondylalgia and Achilles, patellar and rotator cuff tendinopathies has been established in previous systematic reviews. While early literature has focused on eccentric exercise for tendinopathies, more recent approaches with good efficacy include patient education on load management strategies and individualised, progressive loading exercises. Overall, effect sizes from this systematic review provide limited evidence to suggest that isotonic tibialis posterior strengthening, stretching and orthoses and general isotonic ankle strengthening, balance and stretching exercises similarly improve pain, mobility and dysfunction in PTTD in the short term compared with no strengthening. Considering the specific type of strengthening protocol, data from this review suggest that eccentric strengthening may be marginally more effective than other types of strengthening, with eccentric but not concentric exercise resulting in significant reductions in self-reported pain, disability and overall foot function compared with controls at 12 weeks.

Methods & Materials

Patients and Setting

The participants of this study were patients with signs and symptoms of PF who were referred to the Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation clinic of Shahid Modarres Hospital in Tehran from March 2017 to January 2019.

Inclusion Criteria

Inclusion criteria of this study were aging between 25 and 60, having clinical diagnosis of PF based on history and physical examination for at least 3 months, and finally not having responded to primary conservative managements such as rest, shoe insoles, conventional physical therapy, exercise therapy, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Exclusion Criteria

Patients were excluded from the study if they had done ESWT or received any injection for PF within the past 3 months, had history of previous surgery for PF, had active bilateral PF, and had systemic inflammatory disease such as rheumatologic diseases, a history of vascular insufficiency and neuropathic heel pain, associated pathology involving the lower limb such as history of tarsal tunnel syndrome, effusion of the ankle indicating an intra-articular disease, old-healed calcaneal fracture, retrocalcaneal bursitis, achilles tendinopathy, ankle osteoarthritis, and finally, any deformity of foot and ankle, including pes planus or pes cavus. Other reasons for exclusion include pregnancy, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, BMI > 33, low back pain with radiation to lower limb, and infection or local trauma near the injection site.

Ethical Considerations

This trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki; hence the process of the treatment was explained to the patients. Once the physician assures that the patient completely agrees with the study protocol, the written consent form was signed or fingerprinted by the patient. The institutional review board of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences (SBUMS) agreed on the protocol of this study. The treatment carried a low risk of adverse side effects and patients were advised that they can withdraw their participation at any time. Patients also had access to the project's physician whenever they experience injection-related infection or fibrosis, persistent pain, and swelling, or any neuromuscular complications. This study was approved by ethical community of SBUMS (code: IR.SBMU.MSP.REC.1397.403) and was registered in the Iranian Center of Clinical Trials (code: IRCT20130523013442N26).

### Effectiveness of isometric exercise in the management of tendinopathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^1151Yycn]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

We examined the short-term effects (≤ 12 weeks) of isometric exercise to either another treatment or no treatment. Overall, isometric exercise was found to be effective in providing pain relief and improving functional disability in tendinopathy, but there is no evidence that it is superior to isotonic exercise. Clifford et al compared isometric exercise with isotonic exercise for GTPS and found no difference between groups at either 4 or 12 weeks. van Ark et al also reported no difference between isometric and isotonic exercise after 4 weeks in patellar tendinopathy. In both studies, the volume of loading or time under tension (TUT) was identical for each group for the duration of the intervention. Given that no difference was found between isometric and isotonic loading after 4 or 12 weeks, muscle contraction type may be less important when TUT is equal as the tendon appears to respond in a similar manner. Furthermore, it suggests that isometric exercise can also be used for progressive tendon loading and not only for acute pain relief as has previously been proposed.

In lateral elbow tendinopathy a combined programme (isometric plus eccentric-concentric exercise) was more effective after 4 weeks than either an eccentric programme or an eccentric-concentric programme. The combined programme consisted of 56 min of loading per session compared with 22 min for the other two programmes. Gatz et al compared eccentric exercise with eccentric exercise combined with isometric exercise for Achilles tendinopathy. No additional benefit was observed with the addition of isometric exercise after either 1 or 3 months. This appears surprising as the TUT was higher in the combined group. A possible explanation for the differences between both studies relates to the loading intensity. For the lateral elbow, progressive loading was achieved by adding weights. However, for the Achilles no external weight was used, and load was progressed in both groups using bodyweight, that is, bilateral to unilateral loading. Progressive tendon loading appears to be critical in the management of tendinopathy, and while this may be achieved by increasing TUT it needs to be considered in conjunction with intensity.

### Exercise for posterior tibial tendon dysfunction: a systematic review of randomised clinical trials and clinical guidelines [^1131ySZf]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

The mechanism of effect for improved outcomes in tendinopathy following strengthening exercise is understood to be related to load. It has been suggested that the load through the tendon during therapeutic exercises needs to be sufficiently high enough to elicit physiological changes within the tendon. While the relationships between internal tendon structure and pain and function are currently unclear, heavy-slow resistance appears to be beneficial in managing Achilles and patellar tendinopathies. It has been suggested that the physiological response to therapeutic exercise may be greater with heavy-slow resistance and eccentric strengthening due to higher loads applied through the tendon during these exercises. The device used for strengthening exercise in the study by Kulig et al allowed for quantification of load and constant resistance throughout the exercise. Participants in the eccentric exercise group in their clinical trial achieved loads 3.3 times higher than those in the concentric group by the end of the 12-week intervention. This raised the possibility that differences in outcomes were dependent on load rather than specific contraction type. Tolerance and ability to perform the exercise with good form were the criteria for progressing load, which suggests that participants in the eccentric group were better able to tolerate higher loads during the exercise programme, optimising tendon response, and leading to the reporting of greater improvements in pain, disability and overall foot function. Physical tests of function (distance covered during 5MWT), however, were not different between groups. This suggests that while participants felt more confident loading their tendon, physical capacity of the tendon might not have improved.
