## Question

A state fair is held annually in a county on a large tract of state-owned property. In recent years, many outside organizations have entered the fairgrounds and distributed literature and paraphernalia to the many thousands of patrons visiting the fair. State fair officials did not endorse any of these organizations but permitted them to disseminate their materials throughout the fairgrounds without charge. Lately, however, many families attending the fair have complained about being harassed by canvassers from these various organizations. In an effort to protect the safety and welfare of the persons visiting the fair, the state legislature enacted a law prohibiting anyone from selling or distributing materials at the state fair. This new statute provided, however, that groups could pay a $50 license fee and distribute their literature from enclosed booths. These booths would be set up along the entrance to the fairgrounds and rented to anyone wishing to sell or distribute materials or soliciting money during the fair. The first year that the statute went into effect, approximately 40 groups rented booth space. There were various organizations paying the $50 license fee. A group of scientists opposed to the use of aerosol spray cans, requested permission to distribute literature at the fairgrounds. The scientists claimed that they simply wanted to warn people of the perils created by the disintegration of the ozone layer from the dispersion of fluorocarbons into the atmosphere. State fair officials offered to lease the scientists a booth at the $50 fee, but refused to permit solicitation activities outside the booth enclosures. The scientists were unwilling to pay the $50 license fee and instituted suit in state court seeking a court order permitting them to distribute literature anywhere in the fairgrounds area. Which of the following is the strongest argument insupport of the constitutionality of the statute?

Answer Choices:
A. The statute applies to the limited area of the state-owned fairgrounds, and does not discriminate among the various organizations by way of their political, religious, or commercial viewpoints.
B. The statute applies to representatives of popular organizations, as well as to representatives of unpopular organizations, and is a democratic expression of the will of the people because it was adopted by the state legislature.
C. The statute is necessary to protect the safety and welfare of persons using a state facility, and does not discriminate among diverse viewpoints since there is an alternative means by which these organizations can reach their audience.
D. The statute protects the patrons of a public facility against unwanted invasions of their privacy by restricting the solicitation activities of those organizations that the patrons do not support.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which argument best supports the constitutionality of a state fair statute that restricts distribution of literature to licensed booths and prohibits solicitation elsewhere on the fairgrounds. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core First Amendment framework for speech in public forums. Then, I should verify whether the fairgrounds constitute a public forum and what level of scrutiny applies. Next, I will examine whether the statute is content-neutral and narrowly tailored to a significant government interest. After that, I need to check whether ample alternative channels for communication exist. Finally, I will compare the answer choices and select the one that most accurately and comprehensively aligns with the constitutional analysis, while double-checking for common pitfalls like overemphasizing viewpoint neutrality without addressing tailoring or alternatives.

> Let me first confirm the legal framework. In public forum doctrine, the state may impose reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions that are content-neutral, narrowly tailored to a significant government interest, and leave open ample alternative channels of communication; if the restriction is content-based, it faces strict scrutiny and is presumptively unconstitutional, so I need to ensure the statute is framed as content-neutral rather than viewpoint-based.

> Wait, let me verify the forum status. A state-owned fairground open to thousands of patrons is a classic public forum for expressive activity, which means any regulation of speech must satisfy the time, place, and manner test rather than strict scrutiny, provided the regulation is content-neutral and not a disguised attempt to suppress particular viewpoints.

> I will now examine content neutrality. The statute prohibits all distribution and solicitation outside booths and allows any group to rent a booth for a modest fee; it does not distinguish among messages based on political, religious, or commercial content, which supports classification as content-neutral rather than viewpoint-discriminatory, even though the $50 fee might be a burden for some speakers.

> Next, I should review the government interest. The legislature's stated purpose is to protect the safety and welfare of fairgoers by reducing harassment and congestion from unregulated canvassing; that is a significant government interest under public forum doctrine, and courts generally defer to legislative judgments on public safety and crowd control in large public events, so I should not undercut that premise without evidence of pretext.

> Hold on, I should verify narrow tailoring. The restriction is geographically limited to the fairgrounds and permits distribution from designated booths; it does not ban speech outright and appears closely fitted to the harms of unregulated solicitation, which supports narrow tailoring rather than being overly broad or unrelated to the safety concern, especially when balanced against the alternative channel provided.

> Let me consider alternative channels. The statute provides a readily available, content-neutral mechanism — renting a booth — that allows organizations to reach the same audience at the fair; this satisfies the requirement that ample alternative channels remain open, even if the scientists in this case decline to use them, which weakens their claim of unconstitutional burden.

> Now, I should compare the answer choices carefully. Option A emphasizes the limited area and viewpoint neutrality, which is correct but incomplete because it omits the tailoring and alternative-channels prongs. Option B focuses on democratic legitimacy and equal application, which is politically appealing but not a standalone constitutional argument. Option D centers on privacy, which is relevant to the legislative rationale but is not the most precise legal formulation. Option C integrates necessity, viewpoint neutrality, and the existence of alternative means, which most closely tracks the three-pronged time, place, and manner test and is therefore the strongest legal argument [^notfound].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought Option A might be sufficient because viewpoint neutrality is so central, but I should correct that impulse: viewpoint neutrality alone is not enough to satisfy the test without also showing narrow tailoring and ample alternatives, so Option C's integrated framing is superior and more likely to persuade a court applying established public forum doctrine [^notfound].

> Final answer: C. The statute is necessary to protect the safety and welfare of persons using a state facility, and does not discriminate among diverse viewpoints since there is an alternative means by which these organizations can reach their audience [^notfound].

---

The strongest argument for the statute's constitutionality is **C. The statute is necessary to protect the safety and welfare of persons using a state facility, and does not discriminate among diverse viewpoints since there is an alternative means by which these organizations can reach their audience**. This aligns with the **time, place, and manner** doctrine: the restriction is content-neutral, narrowly tailored to a significant government interest (safety and order), and leaves open ample alternative channels (booths) for expression [^notfound]. Options A and B are weaker because they do not explicitly tie the restriction to a compelling state interest or demonstrate narrow tailoring, while D introduces a privacy rationale that is not the primary legal basis upheld in public forum cases [^notfound].

---

## Legal framework: time, place, and manner restrictions

The First Amendment permits content-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions in public forums if they meet three criteria:

- **Content-neutrality**: The restriction must not discriminate based on the content or viewpoint of the speech [^notfound].
- **Significant government interest**: The restriction must serve a significant government interest, such as public safety, order, or welfare [^notfound].
- **Narrow tailoring and alternative channels**: The restriction must be narrowly tailored to the interest and leave open ample alternative channels for communication [^notfound].

---

## Application to the statute

### Content-neutrality

The statute is **content-neutral** because it applies uniformly to all organizations, regardless of their political, religious, or commercial viewpoints. It does not favor or disfavor any particular message, which satisfies the content-neutrality requirement [^notfound].

---

### Significant government interest

The statute serves a **significant government interest** by addressing complaints of harassment and ensuring public safety and welfare at a state-owned facility. Courts have consistently recognized public safety and order as legitimate governmental interests justifying reasonable restrictions on speech in public forums [^notfound].

---

### Narrow tailoring and alternative channels

The statute is **narrowly tailored** because it restricts distribution to designated booths, thereby reducing harassment and congestion without banning speech outright. Additionally, it provides an alternative channel — renting a booth for a nominal fee — ensuring that organizations can still reach their audience [^notfound].

---

## Analysis of alternative options

| **Option** | **Analysis** |
|-|-|
| A. Limited area and non-discrimination | While true, this option does not explicitly connect the restriction to a significant government interest or demonstrate narrow tailoring, making it less compelling than option C [^notfound]. |
| B. Democratic expression and equal application | This option appeals to democratic legitimacy but lacks the explicit legal grounding in time, place, and manner doctrine, rendering it weaker than option C [^notfound]. |
| D. Privacy protection | Privacy is not the primary legal basis for upholding such restrictions in public forums, and this option does not address the core legal requirements of time, place, and manner restrictions [^notfound]. |

---

## Conclusion

Option C is the **strongest argument** because it comprehensively addresses the three prongs of the time, place, and manner test: content-neutrality, significant government interest, and narrow tailoring with alternative channels. This alignment with established First Amendment jurisprudence makes it the most legally persuasive choice [^notfound].

### COVID-19 raises a health and human rights imperative to advance a UN convention on the rights of older persons [^1116xZ1w]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Substantive authorities

Health and human rights threats faced by older persons in the COVID-19 pandemic have exposed limitations of existing human rights instruments, with past international and regional efforts pointing to necessary health-related obligations under this prospective convention. It is crucial in the convention that the right to health be expanded to provide specific obligations that respect the inherent dignity of older persons, protect against health discrimination on the basis of age and fulfil the need for age-appropriate care. Consistent with attributes of the right to health, the care provided — in the community and in long-term care facilities — must be available, accessible, acceptable, affordable and of sufficient quality, considering the needs of older populations, the advancements of medical science and the provision of palliative care. With specific attention to residential care settings, it will be necessary to ensure that healthcare is provided voluntarily, free of violence and undertaken with informed consent, respecting the independence, autonomy and liberty of older persons.

Beyond specific provisions of the right to health, it will be crucial that states mainstream health throughout the prospective convention, encompassing a wide range of human rights that underlie public health and proscribing prejudices that marginalise older persons. This will require an intersectional approach to the health challenges facing older persons — whether on account of income, gender, sexual orientation, race, disability or indigenous status — with efforts to ensure that health workers are trained and equipped to address overlapping vulnerabilities in realising underlying determinants of health without discrimination. Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of safeguarding the rights of older persons in emergency contexts, requiring treaty provisions to ensure that older persons are prioritised in state interventions to ensure health and safety during armed conflict, natural disasters, climate change, pandemic threats, migration and other situations of risk – aligning human rights law with international humanitarian law in upholding the human rights of older persons.

### Guidance for occupational health services in medical centers [^112hmQfA]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Health care safety and occupational health — accreditation and program elements state that facilities require a safety program with skills spanning safety, industrial hygiene, engineering, environmental management, housekeeping, workers' compensation, and clinical disciplines, and programs that include written policies, internal inspection and quality assurance, and top management commitment to safety, health, and environmental management (SHEM). OHS (occupational health services) clinician collaboration in several core functions is described as essential alongside safety staff leadership. Hazard management specifies that hospital safety staff should develop programs, and many of these require medical surveillance programs, medical evaluation for fitness and capacity, and medical support for failures. Incident management practices include establishing incident review boards to identify what should have occurred, what actually occurred, and why the two diverged, with groups functioning better when composed of individuals with a wide variety of skills and diverse viewpoints, and some organizations include near misses. Ongoing safety monitoring includes scheduled evaluations of the environment of care (safety rounds) and walk-throughs with safety, employee health, and employee representatives, and annual written reports of money spent, costs saved, and services delivered to remind management of program value.

### How to operationalise human rights for COVID-19 measures [^113mtAsQ]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Core human rights norms

First and foremost is the duty to respect, protect and fulfil the right to life, including basic healthcare. States that do not implement measures against communicable diseases, like disease control, will be in violation of this human rights duty. The same is the case for access to water, sanitation and hygiene, which are necessary to prevent the spread of COVID-19. States must balance their use of resources and the COVID-19 measures with that of addressing other health issues. Patients with cancer, malaria, diabetes, tuberculosis or cardiovascular diseases have the same level of human rights protection as patients suffering from COVID-19. While the room for manoeuvre is larger in high-income countries than in low-income and middle-income countries, the human rights guidance will be the same.

While promoting the right to life and health, states must align these measures with other human rights obligations, especially civil and political rights. The right to privacy, freedom of movement and other fundamental human rights have to be respected as far as possible.

Civil and political rights can be limited by state authorities. Three requirements must be met: the measure must (1) be provided by law; (2) serve a legitimate aim, for instance protection of health and safety; and (3) be necessary in a democratic society. In addition, the measure must be proportional compared with the aims, it must be effective, as unintrusive as possible and mitigating actions must be considered. A 'pressing social need' and 'relevant and sufficient' reasons are often mentioned as conditions.

Discrimination constitutes another threshold. Discrimination in this regard is unjust differential treatment based on gender, ethnicity, national origin, religion, age or other personal characteristics, resulting in better or worse treatment of specific groups compared with the population at large. There is emerging evidence that ethnic minorities run a larger risk of COVID-19 mortality, which may justify proactive measures for specific groups in society.

### Lessons learned from COVID-19 response in correctional and detention facilities [^1121kQMs]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, persons held in correctional and detention facilities in the United States experienced higher COVID-19 incidence and deaths than the general public. Dense housing conditions in those settings can increase the risk for rapid virus transmission among both persons held in and persons working in these facilities, and high prevalence of comorbidities among incarcerated persons can increase the risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes.

Because of elevated COVID-19 risk, public health agencies recommended enhanced prevention strategies for correctional and detention facilities. However, some strategies were difficult to implement or produced unintended consequences. For example, limiting in-person visitation and implementing quarantine and medical isolation in restrictive environments negatively affected mental health among incarcerated persons. In addition, such restrictive conditions discouraged persons from reporting COVID-19 symptoms, sometimes resulting in further transmission and large outbreaks.

During the pandemic, many correctional and detention facilities shifted operations to address healthcare and public health needs in addition to traditional security and public safety priorities. Over the extended period that these public health measures were in place, facilities had to find ways to balance COVID-19 prevention with ongoing security, mental health, and programmatic needs. To maintain this balance, facilities and public health agencies collaborated in unprecedented ways, sharing information and developing cross-disciplinary relationships.

Numerous editorial articles have highlighted the need to prioritize confinement facilities in future public health responses (,–). In addition, published review articles emphasized the importance of collaborative approaches among public health and correctional agencies to address infectious diseases in correctional and detention facilities broadly. Several existing qualitative analyses included perspectives from primarily individual carceral systems, from multiple carceral systems at the same governmental level (i.e. state prisons), and from incarcerated persons regarding their unique needs during the COVID-19 response (,–). However, empirical evidence is limited providing perspectives from a different types and levels of criminal justice organization types alongside viewpoints from healthcare organizations and health departments, all of whom play integral roles in infectious disease preparedness and response. In this analysis, we report findings from in-depth interviews with diverse public health and justice system organizations across the United States about the COVID-19 response in correctional settings. We identify and document common challenges, successful strategies, and actionable steps that public health practitioners can take to promote correctional health and to support correctional and detention facilities beyond COVID-19.

Guiding principles — culture of safety: No regulation or guideline can ensure safe practices, and individual and organizational attitudes regarding safety will influence all aspects of safe practice. Each organization should strive to develop a culture of safety that is open and nonpunitive, encourages questions, and is willing to be self-critical, and persons and organizations must be committed to safety, be aware of risks, behave in ways that enhance safety, and be adaptable.

### The safety-autonomy grid: a flexible framework for navigating protection and independence for older adults [^112Pe6Yc]. The Gerontologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Quadrant IV — Safety at All Costs (Autonomy Revoked)

This quadrant represents an overemphasis on safety, often resulting in the complete loss of autonomy. Common examples include full guardianship, restrictive or premature institutional care, or caregiving that limits personal decision-making. This overemphasis can occur at both individual and institutional levels, leading to significant restrictions on personal choice and independence.

In certain situations, older adults at the center of these conversations may recognize this overprotective dynamic developing and could use the Safety–Autonomy Grid as a framework to communicate their preferences before external decisions override their autonomy. For older couples aging together, the grid could also support joint discussions, helping partners articulate how they each balance their own safety and independence, especially if one partner's health or cognitive needs change faster than the other's.

However, when these proactive conversations do not occur — or when external decision-makers disregard older adults' expressed wishes — overprotection often unfolds.

For example, consider an otherwise healthy older woman living alone who one day suffers a fall in her home. Her adult children in another state are alarmed and worried and exert undue pressure on her to go into an assisted living facility against her wishes. Or, at the institutional level, consider an older adult admitted to a rehabilitation facility who lives alone with no nearby relatives. If concerns are raised about their cognitive abilities — sometimes without thorough assessment — the facility may petition the court for guardianship to ensure authorized decision-making throughout their stay and discharge planning. Full guardianship is frequently imposed without considering less restrictive alternatives, even when individuals retain certain capacities. This can lead to the denial of financial, medical, and personal autonomy, even when appropriate support is available.

This quadrant raises significant concerns about overprotection and the potential for elder abuse in the guise of paternalistic safeguarding. Decision-makers — whether probate judges, family members, or institutions — must ask themselves: "Are we unnecessarily stripping away autonomy in the name of safety?" or "Have we meaningfully explored community-based supports or less restrictive alternatives?" The ethical questions raised here underscore the importance of carefully weighing immediate protective benefits against the long-term consequences of removing decision-making power from older adults.

### The APA guidelines for psychological practice with sexual minority persons: an executive summary of the 2021 revision [^113nZsgK]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Guideline — Psychologists recognize the influence of institutional discrimination that exists for sexual minority persons, and the need to promote social change, with institutional discrimination defined as "societal-level conditions that constrain the opportunities, resources, and well-being of socially disadvantaged groups" and also described as structural stigma and environmental microaggressions. Institutional discrimination varies across environmental contexts, varies in the same context across time, and is associated with negative mental and behavioral health outcomes for sexual minority persons. Research links policy environments to health, noting that exclusionary policies have resulted in increased rates of mood disorders, dysthymia, and generalized anxiety disorder among sexual minority persons, whereas when legal recognition was available to same-sex couples sexual minority persons had less psychological distress and greater well-being, and legalization of same-sex marriage at the state level was associated with reduction in reported adolescent suicide attempts. Protective policies are associated with better outcomes and safety indicators, with the prevalence of psychiatric disorders significantly lower for sexual minority persons in states that had hate crime statutes and employment nondiscrimination policies inclusive of sexual minority persons compared to those living in states without such policies, and implementation of hate crime and employment non-discrimination laws that include sexual orientation negatively correlated with reported hate crime incidence. Additional documented impacts include that institutional discrimination contributes to greater tobacco and illicit drug use among sexual minority youth and that lack of legal protections for sexual minority older adults contribute to increased rates of poverty.

### Making state public health laws work for SARS outbreaks [^113Tnump]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Traditional Powers

The drafters of the U.S. Constitution gave states broad powers to control communicable diseases because the colonies were ridden with malaria, yellow fever, cholera, and typhoid. States exercised these powers as necessary, quarantining persons and even whole cities and regions. This public health authority has been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in all cases, except when it is was clearly a subterfuge for racial discrimination, and in 1950, every state and local health department had clear powers to conduct case-finding and isolate or quarantine persons who represented a potential public health risk.

State public health laws do not need to be detailed and specific, but they can give public health agencies the general authority to protect the public's health and safety. Consistent with the Constitution, courts allow government agencies to fill in the details of these laws. Statutes do not need specific judicial review because all detentions are reviewable through habeas corpus proceedings. Habeas corpus is a fundamental part of Anglo-American law, protecting persons against illegal detention. A part of the U.S. Constitution, habeas corpus needs no additional statutory authorization, although all states provide for it.

Persons detained by the state may file a habeas corpus petition and demand that a court review their detention. In the case of quarantine due to disease, a judge would determine whether the state has shown that the detained person deserves quarantine. The judge must defer to public health authorities on their choice of public health strategies. Public health orders get the most permissive judicial review, the rational relationship test, because they are based on objective criteria, are usually of limited duration, and are necessary to prevent imminent harm.

Duty to protect employees and visitors — workplace violence and regulatory duties are outlined as follows: "In recent years, health care facilities have become targets of violence", and "Violence or threat of violence necessitates the involvement of law enforcement". "There are no national standards specifically addressing workplace violence, although federal law requires that 'each employer shall furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment, which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees'. "This is referred to as the General Duty Clause, and specific recommendations are enumerated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)". "Helpful information in establishing step-by-step safety policies to protect health care employees from potentially violent visitors can be found on the OSHA Web site (https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/workplaceviolence/)". Reporting rules include that "Certain 'low-risk industries', including physicians' offices, are exempt from reporting injuries and illness to OSHA. However, when a workplace incident results in a fatality or serious injury, including inpatient hospitalization, reporting is required", and "State and local agencies may have broader regulatory and reporting requirements". Risk assessment options are that "A safety audit can be performed to evaluate the workplace for various hazards, including workplace violence", and "a safety and security professional may provide a more-detailed and comprehensive analysis".

### Standards of care for the health of transgender and gender diverse people, version 8 [^115TrF76]. International Journal of Transgender Health (2022). High credibility.

Standards of Care for the Health of Transgender and Gender Diverse People, Version 8 — institutional and carceral settings highlight privacy, safety, and discrimination issues for transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people and specify search and facility practices. The text notes that TGD individuals "are often deprived of privacy in bathroom and shower use" and that many "report avoiding public restrooms" leading to "urinary tract infections and kidney-related problems". In carceral environments, "pat downs, strip searches and body cavity searches should be conducted by staff members of the same sex with the understanding this may not be possible in extreme emergencies", and "The incidental viewing of searches by other employees should be avoided". It adds that "Private use of shower and toilet facilities for incarcerated transgender people is also required by some laws, including for instance the United States' federal Prison Rape Elimination Act in the US". The population of aging/older TGD persons needing institutional services "is increasing", and surveys in hospice, palliative, and long-term care report that TGD patients "often do not get their basic needs met, are discriminated against in their medical care access, or are physically and/or emotionally abused", with "many elderly TGD residents" concealing their gender identity due to "fear of insensitive treatment or frank discrimination".

### State telepharmacy policies and pharmacy deserts [^116FrGsY]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

To date, telepharmacy is permitted in 28 states, with varying statutes and regulations based on the needs of each state. Although telepharmacy has a long history and broad adoption globally, receives support from nationally recognized pharmacy organizations, and has evidence indicating its ability to safely dispense medication and enhance medication adherence, states impose burdensome restrictions on the practice through policy. These varied restrictions, including those limiting the geographic location of a telepharmacy, can be arbitrary and capricious, placing an undue burden on Boards of Pharmacy to enforce and pharmacy owners to comply, the consequences of which transfer to the patient. Although pharmacy deserts can occur in rural and urban areas, this study explores the extent to which adopting telepharmacy statutes and regulations may be associated with improved access to medications by reducing the number of pharmacy deserts, as defined in accordance with definitions in other published literature, and the population within them.

### An investigation into the public's attitude toward opting out of brain death [^115CkhHo]. Neurocritical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Brain death was formalized as the medico-legal standard of death in 1981 when the President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research created the Uniform Determination of Death Act (UDDA). The UDDA states that death is declared when an individual has sustained either (1) irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions or (2) irreversible cessation of all functions of the brain, including the brain stem. The UDDA was created in response to the growing patchwork of state statutes across the United States that were created in the wake of the Definition of Irreversible Coma report by the Ad Hoc Committee of the Harvard Medical School to Examine Brain Death. The President's Commission sought to create a uniform recommendation to remedy the growing disparities between states as well as give justification for the whole-brain and cardiopulmonary views of death. Although some deviation exists across states, the UDDA has been widely adopted as the medico-legal standard across all 50 states and is endorsed by various medical and legal organizations.

The most notable deviation from the UDDA is in New Jersey, where an individual can "opt-out" of brain death determination and instead require physicians to use the cardiopulmonary definition if the individual has a religious-based disagreement with brain death. In these cases, continued support is provided after brain death determination until there is death by cardiopulmonary criteria (e.g. after irreversible cardiac arrest). Patients with brain death who continue to receive treatment could potentially have a heartbeat for months after a determination of brain death. The New Jersey exemption stands alone as the only statute in the United States that requires hospitals to continue indefinite support. However, New York and California, while not requiring indefinite support, have "reasonable accommodation" clauses requiring a period of continued support for families with an understanding that support will be withdrawn after this period has ended. Illinois adds leniency to their death statute by requiring hospitals to adopt policies and procedures to allow health care professionals, in documenting a patient's time of death at the hospital, to take into account the patient's religious beliefs concerning the patient's time of death. This allows families time to accept that their loved one is dead, even when their cardiopulmonary function continues.

### Role of patient safety organizations in improving patient safety [^1112vZ3t]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Research into the incidence of harm and death resulting from medical error has continued after the release of "To Err Is Human". Although debate of the incidence of harm from medical errors continues, patient safety experts agree that medical errors still occur at considerable and unacceptable rates. Continued attention and examination of medical errors are required. Patient Safety Organizations are a federal program that enables providers across the health care delivery system to analyze and learn from errors with the protection of privilege and confidentiality.

### Clarifying the best interests standard: the elaborative and enumerative strategies in public policy-making [^113SBTX7]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2016). Low credibility.

One recurring criticism of the best interests standard concerns its vagueness, and thus the inadequate guidance it offers to care providers. The lack of an agreed definition of 'best interests', together with the fact that several suggested considerations adopted in legislation or professional guidelines for doctors do not obviously apply across different groups of persons, result in decisions being made in murky waters. In response, bioethicists have attempted to specify the best interests standard, to reduce the indeterminacy surrounding medical decisions. In this paper, we discuss the bioethicists' response in relation to the state's possible role in clarifying the best interests standard. We identify and characterise two clarificatory strategies employed by bioethicists -elaborative and enumerative-and argue that the state should adopt the latter. Beyond the practical difficulties of the former strategy, a state adoption of it would inevitably be prejudicial in a pluralistic society. Given the gravity of best interests decisions, and the delicate task of respecting citizens with different understandings of best interests, only the enumerative strategy is viable. We argue that this does not commit the state to silence in providing guidance to and supporting healthcare providers, nor does it facilitate the abuse of the vulnerable. Finally, we address two methodological worries about adopting this approach at the state level. The adoption of the enumerative strategy is not defeatist in attitude, nor does it eventually collapse into (a form of) the elaborative strategy.

### The safety-autonomy grid: a flexible framework for navigating protection and independence for older adults [^115ynz5Z]. The Gerontologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The balance between safety and autonomy becomes a central tension for older adults with cognitive impairments, complex health needs, or age-related vulnerabilities. This tension arises across individual decision-making, interpersonal relationships, in institutional environments, and in broader societal structures. The Safety–Autonomy Grid provides a practical framework to address this evolving challenge, helping individuals such as family members, caregivers, and policymakers understand this tension and better navigate the balance between safety and independence for older adults. This framework promotes more balanced and reflective decision-making to promote person-centered outcomes that preserve dignity and independence while ensuring appropriate protection. The framework also highlights the pragmatic balance between safety and autonomy as a fluid, evolving process that can be applied across caregiving, legal, and policy contexts. While the framework presents numerous applications, its adoption may face certain challenges, such as institutional resistance, cultural biases, and long-established protocols that make it difficult to embrace new approaches. Ultimately, the Safety–Autonomy Grid serves as a practical tool for promoting more equitable decision-making, ensuring that older adults' rights are preserved and that decisions are made with careful consideration, free from bias or undue haste.

### ACOG committee statement no. 12: health care for women and gender-diverse active-duty and reserve uniformed service members and veterans [^116B6Uiv]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). High credibility.

Abortion care coverage and access — The 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision made it imperative for both the military and the VHA to preserve access to abortion care and contraception. The Hyde Amendment restricts the use of federal funding to provide abortions, and TRICARE covers abortions only in the following circumstances: 1) the life of the birthing person is at risk or 2) the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest. Meanwhile, the VHA allows for the following provision of abortion services: 1) the life or health of the pregnant veteran or VHA beneficiary would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term or 2) the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest. Both the military and the VHA consider restrictions to abortion services a patient-safety issue, and it is policy to offer abortion care to eligible individuals even when abortion is prohibited in that state; in those instances, active-duty individuals and veterans are allowed to travel across state lines to the nearest facility to receive necessary care, and the Shaheen Amendment has been proposed to ensure that service members who need abortion services do not incur financial hardship secondary to traveling to access care and also are given the appropriate convalescent leave.

### Diversity, equity, inclusion, and health inequities training in neurologic disorders and stroke: analysis and recommendations from the NINDS advisory council working group [^111qp2Uy]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Foundational Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Training for All Scientists Supported by NINDS

The purpose of this training should be to ensure that all scientists have an understanding of issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion with special emphasis on racism and its effects on the design, conduct, and interpretation of research. HDs are universal, and the design of any clinical interventions requires knowledge of how disparities negatively affect all patient experiences and outcomes. It is imperative that the NINDS standardizes and implements training for all NINDS-funded scientists in the domains of diversity, equity, and inclusion with 2 specific goals: (1) to enable researchers to better design and implement studies with health inequity in mind and (2) to give researchers the knowledge and skills to better support and understand UIM trainees and colleagues. We recommend developing both online and in-person training programs in these domains. Online training programs have the advantage of easily reaching a wide geographic audience. However, it is important to have in-person or virtual experiences to improve individual comfort and fluency with difficult topics. The content of such training programs should include education on the history of racism in research and health care, discussion of implicit and explicit bias, and recognition of the benefits of diversity in organizations. Trainings that teach individuals how to approach systemic inequities and how to solve problems with an equity framework could help researchers in developing antiracist identities and lead to important structural changes within their institutions and research programs. Finally, the education must build an awareness of the direct effect of racism today on patients, trainees, and colleagues. From a practical perspective, these training programs could be analogous to those focused on scientific ethics, human studies protection, preventing toxic workplace environment, information security, laboratory safety, radiation safety, and other essential aspects of the modern scientific enterprise. To implement in-person or virtual components, we recommend that the NINDS works in collaboration with universities, research institutes, companies, and other organizations that conduct NINDS-sponsored research and assist them in developing these capabilities. Input from communities and from diverse patients is critical to inform training and to ensure accurate and fair representation of the issues discussed.

### The global health and care worker compact: evidence base and policy considerations [^115wWD8H]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Background

During the COVID-19 pandemic, and recognising the sacrifice of health and care workers alongside discrimination, violence, poor working conditions and other violations of their rights, health and safety, in 2021 the World Health Assembly requested WHO to develop a global health and care worker compact, building on existing normative documentation, to provide guidance to 'protect health and care workers and safeguard their rights'.

Methods

A review of existing international law and other normative documents was conducted. We manually searched five main sets of international instruments: (1) International Labour Organization conventions and recommendations; (2) WHO documents; (3) United Nations (UN) human rights treaties and related documents; (4) UN Security Council and General Assembly resolutions and (5) the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols. We included only legal or other normative documents with a global or regional focus directly addressing or relevant to health and care workers or workers overall.

Results

More than 70 documents met our search criteria. Collectively, they fell into four domains, within which we identified 10 distinct areas: (1) preventing harm, encompassing (A) occupational hazards, (B) violence and harassment and (C) attacks in situations of fragility, conflict and violence; (2) inclusivity, encompassing (A) non-discrimination and equality; (3) providing support, encompassing (A) fair and equitable remuneration, (B) social protection and (C) enabling work environments and (4) safeguarding rights, encompassing (A) freedom of association and collective bargaining and (B) whistle-blower protections and freedom from retaliation.

Discussion

A robust legal and policy framework exists for supporting health and care workers and safeguarding their rights. Specific human rights, the right to health overall, and other binding and non-binding legal documents provide firm grounding for the compact. However, these existing commitments are not being fully met. Implementing the compact will require more effective governance mechanisms and new policies, in partnership with health and care workers themselves.

National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) access and queries — hospitals and health care systems are required to query the National Practitioner Data Bank when a physician applies for privileges and during the reappraisal process. Because of the implications of reports submitted to the National Practitioner Data Bank, individuals may wish to order a self-query, and individuals or health care organizations may add a statement to provide any additional information to be included with the report. Individuals should contact their professional medical liability carriers about any licensure restriction or any review or investigation that might affect licensure or practice privileges. Information in the National Practitioner Data Bank is not accessible to the public, but is accessible by various entities, such as state licensing boards, federal licensing agencies, and professional societies conducting peer review, and in some instances these entities are required to review the Data Bank.

SHEA expert guidance — patient interaction and visit logistics instructs handlers to approach patients from the side that is free of any invasive devices and to prevent the animal from having contact with catheter insertion sites, medical devices, breaks in the skin, bandage materials, or other compromised body sites. Before entering an elevator with an animal, handlers should ask other passengers for permission and not enter if any passenger is reluctant or apprehensive. The guidance requires hand hygiene before and after contact for anyone wishing to touch the animal, not permitting a patient to eat or drink while interacting with the animal, restricting the animal from patient lavatories, and states that facilities should maintain a log of all animal-assisted activities visits that includes rooms and persons visited for potential contact tracing.

Behavior that undermines a culture of safety — organizational policies states that disruptive physician behavior creates a difficult working environment and threatens the quality of patient care and patient safety. Clear standards of behavior that acknowledge the consequences of disruptive and intimidating behavior must be established and communicated, and confidential reporting systems and assistance programs for physicians who exhibit disruptive behavior should be established. A clearly articulated hospital-wide policy and procedure relating to disruptive behavior should be developed and enforced by hospital administration, and to preserve professional standing, physicians should understand how to respond to and mitigate the effect of complaints or reports.

### Committee opinion no. 681: disclosure and discussion of adverse events [^113cAtSs]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Disclosure and discussion of adverse events — organizational guidance emphasizes culture, policies, and support. Health care facilities should establish a nonpunitive, blame-free culture that encourages staff to report adverse events and near misses (close calls) without fear of retaliation, and health care institutions should have written policies that address the management of adverse events. Coordinated responses to adverse events also must include identification and treatment of the health care practitioners and ancillary staff who become "second victims". The document adds that having a responsive process to inform and aid the patient, loved ones, and practitioners is required, and that after an adverse outcome, patients expect and want timely and full disclosure of the event, an acknowledgment of responsibility, an understanding of what happened, expressions of sympathy, and a discussion of what is being done to prevent recurrence.

Standards of Care Version 8, Statement 2.3 — Health care providers: We recommend health care providers understand the impact of social attitudes, laws, economic circumstances, and health systems on the lived experiences of transgender and gender diverse people worldwide. TGD people's lived experiences vary greatly, depending on a range of factors, including social, cultural (including spiritual), legal, economic and geographic, and HCPs should be aware of the traditions and realities within which health care is available and provide support that is sensitive to the local needs and identities of TGD people and provide them with culturally competent and safe care. From a global perspective, the circumstances in which TGD people live are often challenging and can impact their health, and these include rights to education, health and protection from medical abuses, work and an adequate standard of living, housing, freedom of movement and expression, privacy, security, life, family, freedom from arbitrary deprivation of liberty, fair trial, treatment with humanity while in detention, and freedom from torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; it is widely accepted that denial of rights can impact sexual and gender minority health and well-being. HCPs can play an important role in rights advocacy, including the right to quality gender-affirming health care that is appropriate, affordable, and accessible.

### COVID-19, quarantines, sheltering-in-place, and human rights: the developing crisis [^116kNvht]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Quarantines and sheltering-in-place orders will continue to be essential tools for containing COVID-19. To better protect vulnerable populations, these practices must acknowledge the rights of individuals as outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The UN General Assembly adopted this declaration in 1948; it has a striking relevance now as we struggle to balance the risks of social contact versus isolation. In the following text, we describe several protections that should be guaranteed for populations sheltering in place, quarantined, or isolated and indicate their basis in the Universal Declaration's articles (Table 1).

1. **Right to a safe workplace (Article 23)**: Employers must provide provisions for a safe workplace and housing that minimize the risk of transmission, including separation of infected and exposed staff, personal protective equipment as needed, and access to and financial support for medical treatment when infected or exposed.
2. **Protections for the vulnerable (Article 25)**: Detained individuals have the right to live in conditions where they can observe social distancing. They have the right to conditions that protect against the spread of disease, including basic sanitation such as soap and water, clean bedding, and access to medical care. In the event of infection within a detainment center, detainees with COVID-19 should be isolated to minimize risk to the uninfected. Detainees exposed to COVID-19 deserve the right to prompt medical evaluation and care and should not be cohorted with detainees known to be infected with COVID-19. Every attempt should be made to give homeless individuals a safe place to stay while sick or infectious.
3. **Right to safe shelter (Article 25)**: Governments must protect the safety of the most vulnerable who shelter in place, and resources must be made available to guarantee women and children the right to safe shelter, alternative housing, and legal resources and counsel.
4. **Right to medical treatment and testing (Article 25)**: Within the capacity of the healthcare system, restrictions on movement should not limit testing and healthcare services. Needed medical equipment and supplies should safely and quickly move into quarantined areas, and medical treatment, including mental health services, should be accessible.
5. **Right to communication, good information, and good counsel (Article 19)**: Communication should remain open, epidemiologic data should be shared, and expert advice should be widely available. Governments, traditional media, and social media companies have the responsibility to vet information sources and not spread misinformation.

### Guidelines for assessment of and intervention with persons with disabilities [^113J7EFR]. The American Psychologist (2012). Medium credibility.

APA Guidelines for assessment and intervention with persons with disabilities — scope, applicability, and limitations are outlined, noting that "Disability is a broad concept that encompasses a wide range of functional limitations and barriers to participation in community life", the Guidelines emphasize environmental factors that may affect assessment validity, and "Suggestions are included for accommodations that may mitigate these factors". An extensive literature search across psychological, medical, rehabilitation, vocational, and educational databases is described, and this literature serves as a basis for the guidance offered. The document clarifies that "Guidelines are not standards", that standards "are generally mandatory and may have an enforcement mechanism", and that the Guidelines are aspirational; they are "not exhaustive and do not apply to every professional and clinical situation", are "not definitive and do not take precedence over a psychologist's well-informed judgment", and "Applicable federal and state statutes also supersede these Guidelines". The Guidelines are primarily intended for psychologists and psychology trainees working with clients with disabilities across varied settings, with examples including hospitals, rehabilitation and community service settings, outpatient practice, educational, religious, correctional, employment, and business contexts addressing legal, insurance, and/or compensation issues; they are designed to facilitate work with clients with disabilities, "not to restrict or exclude any psychologist… or to require specialized certification", recognize that specialists may seek more extensive disability training, and are "not meant to be prescriptive, but instead offer recommendations on areas of knowledge and clinical skills considered applicable to this work".

### The current approach of the courts [^117ShkcG]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2014). Low credibility.

The approach of the courts when considering proprietary ('ownership') interests in human bodily material has been pragmatic and piecemeal. The general principle was initially that such material is not legally 'property' that can be 'owned', but courts have recognised many exceptions. In determining disputes between individuals in particular cases, they have stated principles that are often inconsistent with those stated in other cases with different facts. Later judges have been constrained by these decisions, especially when made at appellate level. They can distinguish the facts of one case from another to achieve a different outcome, but they cannot state new principles to be applied more widely to promote consistency. This requires the will of Parliament and legislation to introduce new principles. Experience to date suggests that such legislation will need to be wide-ranging and complex, with different principles for different circumstances. There will not be one area of law that answers all the issues that arise.

Catheterization laboratory occupational health — role of hospitals: Hospitals have the legal responsibility to monitor and assure worker safety and occupational radiation exposure, and each institution's radiation physics provides training and monitoring of personnel and equipment; accordingly, hospitals have a "fiduciary type" responsibility for those working in their facilities and an implicit responsibility not only to maintain and calibrate present imaging systems but also to equip catheterization laboratories with the most modern equipment (imaging and protective) established to offer benefits to the safety and welfare of their workforce. It further states that calibration of the X-ray system, modernization with updated features, replacement of outdated imaging systems, and equipment maintenance are the responsibilities of the hospital, and that hospitals and health care systems should recognize that foregoing protective equipment and wellness processes to save expenditures at the expense of the long-term health of their workers is ultimately more costly, since it generates increased turnover, higher labor downtime, and increased replacement costs. The broader aim is a laboratory design that achieves a completely radiation-safe environment that eliminates the need for personal protective apparel and thereby mitigates the orthopedic consequences.

IPC program key partnerships and collaborators within the healthcare facility include a recommendation that personnel outside the IPC program "should have alignment of their performance goals that include partnership with and focus on IPC activities". The page states "Creating a fully effective IPC program involves partnerships with personnel from other key facility departments and entities", adds that such personnel "can directly impact the effectiveness of the IPC program", and specifies that leaders "should set expectations for areas of these partners that include alignment with IPC goals and appropriate resources to meet those goals". Examples include EVS personnel, where "Pathogens can survive in the environment for prolonged periods of time, and EVS personnel play a key role in preventing infectious pathogen transmission in the facility", and "Their work in ensuring regular cleaning and disinfection of surfaces, equipment, and the facility environment reduces the risk of transmission of infectious pathogens throughout the facility", and occupational health (OH), where programs are "responsible for ensuring a safe workplace, and partnership with the IPC program can effectively monitor and address potential infectious disease harms for HCP", with "evaluation and audit of personal protective equipment use" and adherence to Occupational Health and Safety Administration requirements among listed activities.

### Standards of care for the health of transgender and gender diverse people, version 8 [^117MtAhB]. International Journal of Transgender Health (2022). High credibility.

Institutional environments — scope and access issues for transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people — are defined as facilities or establishments in which people live and receive care in a congregate or large group setting, where individuals may or may not have freedom of movement, individual consent, or agency, and include carceral facilities and noncarceral facilities such as long-term care, in-patient psychiatric facilities, domiciliaries, hospice/palliative care, and assisted living. TGD residents in carceral facilities report the lack of access to medically necessary transgender-specific health care, which is ranked as their number one concern while incarcerated, and controlled studies show clinically significant health and mental health disparities for justice-involved transgender people compared to matched groups of transgender people who have not been incarcerated or jailed. The page notes systemic racial inequities, racial disparities in health outcomes, and the overrepresentation of TGD people of color in some facilities, and states that discrimination against TGD residents in palliative care settings, including hospice, is common, and the needs of TGD patients or their surrogates have been ignored in these settings. It further states that care for an institutionalized person must consider the individual does not have the access that non-institutionalized persons have to securing care on their own, and that institutionalized persons must be supported in being able to receive the Standards of Care established by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH).

### The global health and care worker compact: evidence base and policy considerations [^116wj6bW]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Right to freedom of association and collective bargaining

All workers, including health and care workers, are entitled to free association and have the right to join and form trade unions, a right recognised independently and as a condition of just and favourable work, pursuant to several core human rights treaties. The ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and several ILO conventions affirm these rights and set forth others. The Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention provides for the rights for workers and employers to establish and join organisations. The Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention states that workers shall be protected from antiunion discrimination and interference in their organisations, and requires states to establish machinery to protect workers' right to organise. Additional ILO conventions and recommendations promote collective bargainingand extend the protections in the core conventions on the right to organise to workers' representatives, public service personnel, and workers employed in domestic settings. Furthermore, the ILO promotes capacity-building for unionsand social dialogue and the rights to unionise and collective bargaining as means for health and care workers to ensure their equal treatment and decent working conditions.

### Guidelines for assessment of and intervention with persons with disabilities [^112P9hXT]. The American Psychologist (2012). Medium credibility.

Guideline 4 — psychologists and disability law states that psychologists strive to learn about federal and state laws that support and protect the rights of people with disabilities, and explains that the goal of laws that protect the rights of individuals with disabilities is to ensure their freedom to participate fully in all aspects of society. Examples named include the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act, and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Those serving children will likely have to advocate for appropriate services within the school system, which includes at its most basic level understanding 504 plans and Individualized Education Programs. Given professional advances, even highly trained and experienced professionals may need continuing education in areas such as assessment, accommodations, use of technology, therapeutic techniques, and federal and local laws and policies governing disability issues, and psychologists may wish to consult national organizations specific to disability issues to increase knowledge and skills.

### The impact of alternative arrangements, contingent jobs, and work secured through an app on the well-being of working age adults: results from the California work and health survey [^1172P5gR]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

4 | DISCUSSION

Although hardly as comprehensive as in many other developed nations, during the 20th Century the US developed a set of laws and regulations to protect workers from discrimination in hiring, promotion, and retention on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, and disability status; to help them attain a minimum of economic security while employed through rights to organize, the establishment of a wage floor, and, more recently, mandating employment-based health insurance coverage; minimizing the economic impacts of work loss through unemployment insurance; minimizing the health risks of work through workers' compensation and occupational health and safety; and maintaining a minimum standard of living in retirement through Social Security and Medicare.

This system of protections was developed over roughly a century, starting with workers' compensation in the first two decades of the last century, and culminating in the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. With certain exceptions, such as the availability of Social Security to self-employed workers, the tie that binds these protections is that they assume that the worker is formally hired by the firm for which work is done. The ride-share driver may not attain a minimum wage when the costs of car ownership are factored in. The person shopping for and then delivering groceries may be at risk for musculoskeletal injuries, just as might the person stocking the shelves in a supermarket who was formally hired to do the work, but without the possibility of filing a workers' compensation claim and without an Occupational and Health Safety Administration (OSHA) inspection to investigate the cause of the injury. While the system of protections for workers formally hired is hardly ironclad — think about the fate of undocumented workers in dangerous factories — workers who are not formally hired by the firm for whom the work is done have fewer protections. Although those in contingent jobs may be formally hired, they too may experience work exposures that adversely affect them after the job is completed. In California, the site of our study and the focus of the California Labor Laboratory, our Center funded by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), there has been considerable legislative and regulatory ferment to try to mitigate the effects of being an independent contractor, having other forms of alternative work, or work secured through an app, principally through Assembly Bill 5 (AB5) which established legal criteria for determining whether, in fact, someone should be considered an employee rather than outside contractor. The effects of AB5 have been somewhat offset by the passage of Proposition 22 in which ride share and delivery companies sought to delimit the reach of AB5 while providing some protections in its stead. As of this writing, the constitutionality of Proposition 22 is before the California Supreme Court. At the Federal level, a new regulation also seeks to mitigate the effects of this kind of work through regulation of the definition of independent contracting.

### An ethical framework adapted for infection prevention and control [^115LpKSm]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Application of the EIPAC framework — Scenario 1

A long-term care home is in COVID-19 outbreak. In one of the semiprivate rooms housing 2 residents on the outbreak unit, one of the residents (ie, the case resident) tests positive for COVID-19, while the other resident (ie, the roommate) tests negative. No single-resident isolation rooms are available at this facility.
Identify the information: Institutional COVID-19 policy and regional best-practice recommendations advise placing residents with COVID-19 in single rooms under transmission-based precautions. Multiple studies demonstrate high secondary attack rates among roommates of individuals with COVID-19 infection. Affected stakeholders included the roommate, who prioritized reducing their personal risk of acquiring COVID-19. The case resident prioritized staying in their own room, which was their home and where they were most comfortable. Other noninfected residents in the facility, including those who the roommate would need to room with to separate from the case resident, prioritized reducing their individual risks of COVID-19 infection. The staff in the facility prioritized reducing the risk of the roommate acquiring COVID-19, as well as minimizing resident exposures and propagation of spread. The long-term care home prioritized reducing the overall burden of COVID-19 in the facility and optimizing the overall welfare of all residents.
Determine the ethical principles: The predefined ethical principles were considered. Principles felt to be most germane included autonomy, proportionality, equity and justice, and transparency (Box 1). While always relevant, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and evidence were considered more neutral dimensions in this instance and were not expected to sway the balance of possible options.
Explore the options: Three options were considered. Option 1 was moving the roommate to a different semiprivate room on the same unit, which would have been shared with another resident who did not have COVID-19. Option 2 was moving the roommate to a semiprivate room on a separate nonoutbreak unit where no residents had COVID-19. Option 3 was keeping the roommate in the current room with the case resident. The best available evidence supports separation of contacts from cases, which may not be possible in situations of resource constraints. Although options 1 and 2 would achieve this, when considering the ethical principles of equity and justice, they both conferred burdens to other residents in the form of risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, either to a nonexposed roommate (option 1) or to a nonoutbreak unit (option 2). These burdens were viewed through an equity lens, recognizing that many residents in the facility had comorbidities and disabilities that made them vulnerable to poor outcomes from COVID-19 infection. Option 3 had the benefit of minimizing burdens to other residents, staff, and the facility, but ongoing exposure of the case resident to the roommate would need to be mitigated as much as possible. Regarding the principle of proportionality, there were concerns that the risks mitigated by options 1 and 2 (separation of the roommate from the case resident) were not commensurate with the associated risks of possibly exposing a nonexposed resident (option 1) or a nonoutbreak unit (option 2). Lastly, transparency was prioritized by involving the long-term care home staff and leadership in decision making, as well as explaining the situation to the affected residents.
Act: Option 3 was selected as the best option because the roommate had already been exposed to the case resident and because options 1 and 2 would have disproportionately conferred burdens to other residents in the facility. Mitigation measures offered to the roommate included masking of both the roommate and case resident, opening windows, closing the curtain between the beds, and providing a dedicated washroom for the case resident. The process was documented to allow the decision to be revisited in the future, if needed. The decision was prospectively evaluated via regular symptom monitoring and a postexposure surveillance SARS-CoV-2 test for the roommate.

Laboratory and animal handling biosafety — program design and collaboration emphasize that "A team approach offers the greatest safety benefits", and occupational health staff "should routinely collaborate with their facility's institutional biosafety committee, emergency department, risk management, animal care and use committee (IACUC), laboratory animal veterinarians, biosafety officers, and other environmental health and safety staff in creating protocols and responding to events"; "Local public health authorities and the CDC can provide expertise and resources; contact information should be immediately available in the clinic". Designing and maintaining these programs "begins with risk and hazard assessment based on the specific animals, pathogens, and procedures in use", and "Occupational health physicians should consider site visits to laboratories and animal facilities if needed to guide their recommendations". "Pathogens for each protocol are assigned an NIH-defined risk group (Table 5) and a CDC biosafety level (Table 6)", and "These designations define and drive required laboratory and personal protective equipment as well as standard operating procedures to minimize risk for staff", while "Animal biosafety levels define additional facilities requirements".

It is easy to read from this sentence that the decision to end one's own life is inevitably without guidelines or arguments, by necessity always arbitrary. Religion, rationality, guiding principles and so on could add nothing to this. Some critics already were speaking of 'voluntaristic narrowing' in the judgment. But that is not the case. The court's statement pertains only to the state's authority to evaluate the decisions of its citizens. The state may not judge the will of the citizen, not even on the basis of the aforementioned criteria, but must accept it. However, this does not apply to the persons themselves or their communities of values or faith.

Of course, persons who are thinking about dying will draw on 'general values, religious precepts, societal norms for dealing with life and death or considerations of objective rationality' and certainly also further concerns. The decision to exit life is amenable to such considerations to a great degree. Yet citizens take these issues into account in different ways and attribute to them different weights so that their decisions are just as diverse. The Federal Constitutional Court now has ascertained that a state, based on human dignity and human rights, may not give preference to certain considerations in terms of content or result nor prohibit them. This is the crucial point of the judgment. Content-related considerations about dying have not lost any significance for the individual. But the state may not judge on the free decision of a citizen to live or die a certain way — of course under the condition that other citizens are not hindered in their way of life.

### Core safeguards for clinical research with adults who are unable to consent [^112Z57V6]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The National Bioethics Advisory Commission has proposed new safeguards for clinical research with adults who are unable to consent. Three other major U.S. groups have also proposed additional safeguards for this population, and existing Canadian and European guidelines already include such safeguards. While these six guidelines agree on some safeguards, they disagree on others. To allow important research to proceed while protecting adults who are unable to consent, it will be crucial to resolve these differences. This paper uses a side-by-side comparison of these six guidelines to highlight their major points of consensus, analyze their significant differences, and distill six core safeguards.

### Periviable birth: legal landscape in Indian jurisprudence [^112Yzmuh]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

We direct that in the event the child is born alive, the State of Maharashtra shall ensure that all necessary medical facilities are provided to the child. If the Petitioners are not willing or not in a position to take responsibility for the child, then the State and State Agencies will have to assume full responsibility for the child.

In L v State, 2023, Delhi High Court remarked that,

If the child is born alive, despite the attempts at medical termination of the pregnancy, the Superintendent, Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, Delhi, shall ensure that everything, which is reasonably possible and feasible in the circumstances is offered to such child, and the Child Welfare Committee concerned shall do the needful in accordance with law(table 2).

Table 2
Major Indian court precedents on periviable neonatal care

The fact that the periviable babies have very bleak chances of survival should not be the sole reason for denying care to them. It would be contrary to the right to life, which includes the right to survival and access to medical care. Holding otherwise will also be in teeth with the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court in Parmanand Katara v Union of India, 1989, where it was stated that, "that preservation of human life is of paramount importance". That is so because once life is lost, the status quo ante cannot be restored, as resurrection is beyond the capacity of man. Article 21 of the Constitution casts the obligation on the State to preserve life. Every doctor, whether at a government hospital or otherwise, has the professional obligation to extend his services with due expertise for protecting life. Furthermore, the concern that the infant, if saved, would be riddled with multiple disabilities should not be the reason for denying medical treatment. Any contrary view would be against the constitutional guarantee of the right to equality and non-discrimination and a violation of the provisions of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, especially Sections 3 (4) and 26.

### The global health and care worker compact: evidence base and policy considerations [^112jjDEt]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Whistle-blower protections and freedom from retaliation

At least two treaties directly relevant to the compact expressly protect whistle-blowers: the ILO Violence and Harassment Convention (2019), providing protection for whistle-blowers regarding work-related violence and harassment, and the UN Convention Against Corruption (2004), protecting anyone who reports information on corruption to the competent authority. An ILO recommendation directs against taking measures prejudicial to workers for complaining of inadequate occupational health and safety protections. And the International Health Regulations (2005) enable WHO to protect the confidentiality of people who provide it with information on unusual public health events.

The right to reveal information necessary to protect one's own or the public's health and safety is inherent in international human rights law. The freedom of expression includes 'freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds… '. nd such information advances the rights to the highest attainable standard of health and 'safe and healthy working conditions'. rohibiting health and care worker whistleblowing, or retaliating against such whistle-blowers, violates these rights.

Retaliation may come in another context as well: threats and harassment, arrest, torture, and even murder for impartially providing healthcare to political opposition figures, victims on the other side of an armed conflict, or alleged terrorists. This prohibition is firmly rooted in the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocolsand is contrary to states' obligation to patients' and health and care workers' rights to life and health.

More broadly, WMA declarations detail medical ethical responsibilities, which require impartial care and not participating in torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, and following ethical principles regarding medical research on human subjects. While speaking specifically to physicians, these declarations captures ethical responsibilities of all health and care workers.

The origins of the use of expert witnesses to assist courts in helping understand the required conduct in determining the standard of care provides a basis for recognizing the consultant role sought in judicial proceedings. Both rules of evidence and court decisions have evolved in a manner that encourages the introduction of expert testimony while conditioning its use to avoid unfair bias. Trial court judges decide on permitting such testimony, while legal counsel is responsible for helping juries determine its importance and reliability. Certain types of restrictions and adverse consequences for misstatements exist but are subordinated to the trial process in most circumstances, a process that varies among different jurisdictions.

### Action to protect the independence and integrity of global health research [^114CZsM8]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Ethics and research governance committees

Ethics committees play a crucial role in ensuring the independence and integrity of research. Researchers seek approval from ethics committees, usually both at their research institutions and in the countries in which research is undertaken. Such committees have a remit to safeguard ethical conduct of research and protect the rights and welfare of research subjects, and primarily draw on biomedical research paradigms to do so. Although research ethics committees do often consider the safety risks posed to individual researchers (injury and incarceration), they do not typically consider concerns about protecting the researchers from interference and threats to their credibility. Therefore, they could play a fuller role in helping researchers navigate related unforeseen ethical dilemmas that arise in the course of research. For example, they can provide guidance on whether to extend protections intended for individual research subjects (eg, to 'do no harm') to organisations. They could also advice researchers on how to balance their ethical obligations to research participants and their obligations to wider society in the face of pressure from vested interests.

Ethics committees should have representation from different research fields, with members who are trained in the epistemological and methodological bases of different disciplines. In addition, procedures for ensuring the independence of ethics committees are vital to prevent a situation in which members' close ties to senior management, funders, ruling parties, governments or commercial interests lead them to use regulatory frameworks to shut down 'unfavourable' or disruptive research.

University research governance offices, where they exist, can complement ethics committees by protecting the rights and welfare of researchers especially where research challenges powerful agendas. They can offer advice and arbitration assistance to researchers on conflicts of interest arising in relation to external research funding. They can monitor for instances of unethical practice to enable research institutions to push back if powerful external actors manipulate research ethics regulations to constrain the research process, as some British universities have done in the past. Research institutions should develop clear value statements and commit to implementing them through their ethics and governance protocols.

### American Thoracic Society / centers for disease control and prevention / Infectious Diseases Society of America: controlling tuberculosis in the United States [^111TJfEz]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

During 1993–2003, incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in the United States decreased 44% and is now occurring at a historic low level (14,874 cases in 2003). The Advisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis has called for a renewed commitment to eliminating TB in the United States, and the Institute of Medicine has published a detailed plan for achieving that goal. In this statement, the American Thoracic Society (ATS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) propose recommendations to improve the control and prevention of TB in the United States and to progress toward its elimination. This statement is one in a series issued periodically by the sponsoring organizations to guide the diagnosis, treatment, control, and prevention of TB. This statement supersedes the previous statement by ATS and CDC, which was also supported by IDSA and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). This statement was drafted, after an evidence-based review of the subject, by a panel of representatives of the three sponsoring organizations. AAP, the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association, and the Canadian Thoracic Society were also represented on the panel. This statement integrates recent scientific advances with current epidemiologic data, other recent guidelines from this series, and other sources into a coherent and practical approach to the control of TB in the United States. Although drafted to apply to TB-control activities in the United States, this statement might be of use in other countries in which persons with TB generally have access to medical and public health services and resources necessary to make a precise diagnosis of the disease; achieve curative medical treatment; and otherwise provide substantial science-based protection of the population against TB. This statement is aimed at all persons who advocate, plan, and work at controlling and preventing TB in the United States, including persons who formulate public health policy and make decisions about allocation of resources for disease control and health maintenance and directors and staff members of state, county, and local public health agencies throughout the United States charged with control of TB. The audience also includes the full range of medical practitioners, organizations, and institutions involved in the health care of persons in the United States who are at risk for TB.

### CDCDD-NRP is consistent with US legal standards for determining death [^1155wZTo]. American Journal of Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

2 THE UNIFORM DETERMINATION OF DEATH ACT

According to the UDDA, a determination of death is to be made in accordance with "accepted medical standards". What constitutes accepted medical standards under the UDDA "was left to be determined by the medical community". This includes what constitutes the "irreversible cessation" of a function and how medical professionals come to its determination. This also includes a medical professional's consideration of the intentions of the patient and the patient's family regarding life‐sustaining efforts or procedures, and the effectiveness or futility of such efforts, which Glazier and Capron object to as being absent from the legal construct.

These are not questions of law, though. In drafting the UDDA, the Commission intentionally chose to limit the scope of the proposed statute to identifying the general physiologic standards for recognizing that death has occurred, omitting the methods and information used by medical professionals to diagnose it. The Commission also recognized that the UDDA would "not remove the need for reasoned interpretation — first by physicians and perhaps then by judges". Furthermore, as provided in the Prefatory Note to the UDDA, the statutory framework itself intentionally defers to the evolving practice of medicine, informed by the principles of medical ethics, to determine death. Any analysis of what constitutes a determination of death must therefore first be rooted in accepted medical standards, including considerations of intent and effectiveness of interventions after circulatory and respiratory functions have ceased, and not simply on a presumed judicial reading or interpretation of select words and phrases in the statute.

Second, regardless of whether "irreversible cessation" means "permanent cessation", which Glazier and Capron assume to be the case but which the American College of Physicians admits is a subject of continued debate, in either case, the cessation of functions under the UDDA can only rationally be considered in relation to spontaneous cardiorespiratory function. All 50 states recognize the concept of brain death as a matter of law, although the statutes governing the determination of death in some states specifically reference "spontaneous" functions. Furthermore, the common law standard for determining death has consistently been "the cessation of all vital functions, traditionally demonstrated by an 'absence of spontaneous respiratory and cardiac functions'. The UDDA, like all uniform acts, aims to extend the common law to include new techniques for determining death. It does not intend to subvert it.

### Lord sumption and the values of life, liberty and security: before and since the COVID-19 outbreak [^113LhCFh]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Public health is a value-laden field. As a vocation and practice, it rests on moral mandates. As a matter of politics and government, it hangs on however we might answer the philosophical question 'what makes health public?'; our explanations of whether, why and in what ways health and health-affecting phenomena are a shared concern within a community. And as a matter of law and regulation, the legitimacy of public health policy rests on the relationships — and tensions — between legal mandates that support governance for the public's health, legal principles that constrain government activity (eg, the rule of law, principles of equality and respect for human rights), and the conformity between these values and wider principles of social justice.

Because questions of ethical value pervade public health practice and policy, they necessarily predominate government responses to the coronavirus pandemic; for better or worse, and to whatever extent this may be explicitly acknowledged. Such questions demand ethical analysis and justification both of the proper aims of policy, and of the proper means of achieving those aims. Nevertheless, in the UK, there has been significant criticism of the paucity of ethical discourse at the level of government; early into the initial responses, and more recently. The breadth of the ethical challenges, the costs and the ethical trade-offs have tremendous and complex reach. It is essential to have open, public debate on the values that will and will not determine policy.

In public spheres beyond government, values have been raised and debated. Perhaps inevitably, given the nature and prominence of different platforms for public discourse, particular voices and views have found particularly privileged place in critical discussions of pandemic responses in the UK. Among these are the arguments of Lord Sumption, a former Justice of the Supreme Court. Lord Sumption is an eloquent and vocal critic of the restrictions regulations (and related points of official guidance) that have been implemented since March 2020. These regulations have significantly curtailed freedoms, including through the institution of protracted lockdowns, to limit transmission of the virus and, in turn, to prevent the National Health Service (NHS) from being overwhelmed. Lord Sumption has consistently questioned the moral, political and legal legitimacy of the measures, challenging both their underpinning rationales — their aims — and the justifiability of their form — the means of achieving those aims.

2.6 Limits on Distribution

SUBLOCADE is subject to a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program that includes, among other elements, a restricted distribution system. The purpose of the restricted distribution system is to ensure that SUBLOCADE is only administered by a health care provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

2.7 Removal of the Depot

In the event the depot must be removed, it can be surgically excised under local anesthesia within 14 days of injection. Only the most recently-injected depot can be removed.

The removed depot should be handled with adequate security, accountability, and proper disposal, per facility procedure for a Schedule III drug product and pharmaceutical biohazardous waste, and per applicable federal, state, and local regulations.

The residual plasma concentrations from previous injections will decrease gradually over subsequent months [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Patients who have the depot removed should be monitored for signs and symptoms of withdrawal and treated appropriately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

Failure to develop, implement, and coordinate adequate hospital evacuation plans can have serious legal, economic, and public health implications, including civil liability, sanctions, loss of accreditation, funding loss, access to care limitations, and stress on regional health-care systems.

Because they are subject to coercion and undue influence, workers should be considered vulnerable subjects of research. A series of ethical guidelines are proposed for medical research on workers that seek to safeguard the rights of workers and maintain the scientific integrity of research. In general, the guidelines emphasize that participation must be voluntary and knowing, that the confidentiality of medical information must be protected, and that the benefits of the research to the participants must be maximized while the risks are minimized.

### Informed consent in decision-making in pediatric practice [^114uX8Ho]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Exceptions to limitations on adolescent medical decision-making — "There are 3 broad categories of when a minor can legally make decisions regarding his or her own health care": specific diagnostic/care categories, the "mature minor" exception, and legal emancipation. For sexual health services, the ability to consent "is recognized in all states", and access has similarly expanded for "mental health and substance abuse prevention and treatment services", reflecting concern that adolescents may avoid care if parental consent is required. However, "state statutes that permit adolescents to consent to these services do not always protect their confidentiality"; accordingly, "Practitioners should become familiar with their state statutes on these issues and consider promoting changes in legislation to improve adolescent confidentiality protection where appropriate". The mature-minor doctrine recognizes a subset of adolescents who can understand "benefits, risks, likelihood of success, and alternatives" and choose voluntarily, and "Most states have mature-minor statutes" guiding judicial determinations that some minors are sufficiently mature to provide their own consent. In contrast, emancipated minor statutes address legal status; adolescents "living separately from their parents and self-supporting, married, or on active duty with the armed forces are generally considered legally emancipated and able to provide informed consent or refusal for their own medical care".

### How economics could extend the scope of ethical discourse [^116xCEHh]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2001). Low credibility.

Ethical discourse is typically inconclusive, and with good reason. But this inconclusiveness is a distinct disadvantage when it comes to helping publicly accountable policy-makers in the health care system provide an ethical justification for their decisions. It is suggested that instead of ending with platitudinous statements such as that a balance has to be struck between the rival ethical considerations, empirical research should be undertaken to elicit the quantitative trade-offs that the affected general public would be prepared to accept when striking this balance. In the expected absence of any consensus, it is further suggested that the views of the median person be taken as the best approximation to the group view. Finally it is argued that, far from this quantitative approach lacking humanity by treating individuals as "mere statistics", it shows greater compassion than the proponents of those approaches whose fellow feeling can only be stirred by information pertaining to identified individuals.

### Ethical concerns about federal approval of risky pediatric studies [^111318gK]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

The US Federal Code limits research with healthy children to no more than a minimal risk of harm; it restricts research with children who have some disorder or condition to no more than a minor increase over minimal risk, unless potential harms are offset by potential benefits to them, as in therapeutic studies. Higher risk studies require "407 approval", named after the relevant section of the code describing requirements. Rarely used until recently, 407 approval requirements include Institutional Review Board approval and authorization by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services after consultation with a panel of experts; a period for public comment; and assurances that there are adequate permission, consent, and assent. This 407-approval mechanism contains both procedural and interpretative ambiguities, which raise ethical concerns about 1) the expertise represented on advisory panels, 2) the scope of the information offered to the public for comment and its potential conflicts with investigators' intellectual property or commercial interests, 3) whether any upper level of risk exists, and 4) how it conforms with other policies such as the best interest of the child standard in the law or in medical decision making.

### Advocacy and collaborative health care for justice-involved youth [^115CHbdb]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

The National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) position statement makes recommendations for the health management of transgender patients held in confinement, including that health staff should manage transgender patients in a manner that respects their biomedical and psychosocial needs; the management of medical or surgical transgender care should follow accepted standards developed by professionals with expertise in transgender health; there should be no blanket administrative or other policies that restrict specific medical treatments; and transgender patients who received hormone therapy with or without a prescription before incarceration should have therapy continued without interruption.

### CDC program evaluation framework, 2024 [^115dYzEE]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Rigor

Evaluations should produce findings that interest holders can confidently rely on while providing clear explanations of limitations. The rigor of an evaluation depends on thoughtful planning and implementation of the underlying design and methods as well as how findings are interpreted and reported. Credible evaluations should be planned, implemented, and interpreted by qualified evaluators in collaboration with interest holders. These evaluators should have the relevant education, skills, and experience for the methods undertaken. An evaluation should use the most appropriate design and methods to answer the evaluation questions while balancing the evaluation goals, scale, timeline, feasibility, and available resources.

Independence and Objectivity

Evaluations should strive to be as independent and objective as possible for interest holders, experts, and the public to accept their findings. The implementation of evaluation activities should be appropriately insulated from political and other undue influences that might affect their objectivity, impartiality, and professional judgment. Evaluators should strive for objectivity in the planning and conducting of evaluations and in the interpretation and dissemination of findings, avoiding conflicts of interest, bias, and any other partiality. To enhance objectivity, evaluators can regularly assess their potential biases, which might affect whom they choose to engage in an evaluation, to what they pay the most attention, and what they might be overlooking as a result.

Transparency

Evaluations should be transparent in the planning, implementation, and reporting phases to enable accountability and help ensure that aspects of an evaluation are not tailored to generate specific findings. Decisions about the evaluation's purpose and objectives, the range of interest holders who will have access to details of the work and findings, the design and methods, and the timeline and strategy for releasing findings should be clearly documented before conducting the evaluation. Once evaluations are complete, comprehensive reporting of the findings should be released in a timely manner and provide sufficient detail so that others can review, interpret, replicate, or reproduce the work.

Ethics

Evaluations should be conducted to the highest ethical standards to maintain trust in the process and products. Evaluations should be planned and implemented to safeguard the dignity, rights, safety, and privacy of participants and other interest holders or affected entities. Evaluators should abide by current professional standards pertaining to treatment of participants. Evaluations should be equitable, fair, and just and should account for cultural and contextual factors that could influence the findings or their use.

### The judgment of the German federal constitutional court regarding assisted suicide: a template for pluralistic states? [^111ZgG5U]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

The price of individualism

The judgment emphasises the rights of an individual vis-à-vis the state. Nevertheless, it definitely does not endorse the concept of a purely individualistic state and opposes an individualistic understanding of human existence. On the contrary, it explicitly emphasises its relationality: 'self-determination is always understood to be relative'. (No. 235 5; official English translation by the court).

The judgment thus assigns an important task to communities of values within a pluralistic society. For civil liberties pose challenges for many people. The question of what a good way of dying is remains for any person, even when the state may no longer weigh in on it. Everyone will have to find their own answer to this, unquestionably also drawing on religious or other values. Even if such conceptions cannot be made generally binding in a pluralistic society, they are relevant for individual persons. Communities of values can provide important orientation for individuals in this situation.

### Ethical considerations in quality improvement: key questions and a practical guide [^115zi6xn]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Safeguarding and welfare

Welfare and safeguarding are paramount to all concerned when conducting a QI project and should be the priority at all stages. This can include (but is not limited to) handling patient and staff data, issues relating to the privacy and confidentiality of patient and staff identities, and the adverse effects resulting from the project.

A sensible starting point for any QI project is to devise a protocol for handling safeguarding issues and ensure that those conducting QI projects are suitably trained. In particular, at points of the project where the risk of a safeguarding issue is much greater. For example, exploring experiences based on sensitive topics or possibly resurfacing previous trauma or uncovering a new safeguarding disclosure. Any drafted protocol must align with current safeguarding practices and should be codesigned with a designated safeguarding representative. All parties involved in the project should be familiar with this process to provide seamless support should a safeguarding issue arise. All those conducting QI should receive relevant safeguarding training and refreshers as part of their mandated training. This is particularly important for organisations that employ QI Leads. For individual projects, all those involved in QI projects should be aware of any local safeguarding procedures.

As well as the immediate safeguarding issues when conducting a QI project with patient engagement, it is also vital to consider any possible long-term effects. Any protocol should provide welfare checks and subsequent support procedures for all those involved. In particular, for sensitive topics, a mandatory supportive review should be available to all those involved in the project. A sufficiently trained person should facilitate the review and be removed from the project itself. If any further distress or issues arise, all those involved should be signposted/referred to any other relevant professional services or internal services. Practical approaches include recording the extent to which patients were involved in the project and associated documents.

### The advisory committee on immunization practices' ethical principles for allocating initial supplies of COVID-19 vaccine-United States, 2020 [^114CyFfD]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Abbreviation: COVID-19 = coronavirus disease 2019.

Maximize benefits and minimize harms. Allocation of COVID-19 vaccine should maximize the benefits of vaccination to both individual recipients and the population overall. These benefits include the reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19–associated morbidity and mortality, which in turn reduces the burden on strained health care capacity and facilities; preservation of services essential to the COVID-19 response; and maintenance of overall societal functioning. Identification of groups whose receipt of the vaccine would lead to the greatest benefit should be based on scientific evidence, accounting for those at highest risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe COVID-19–related disease or death, and the essential role of certain workers. The ability of essential workers, including health care workers and non–health care workers, to remain healthy has a multiplier effect (i.e. their ability to remain healthy helps to protect the health of others or to minimize societal and economic disruption). Some of these workers are at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection because of their limited ability to maintain physical distance in the workplace or because they do not have consistent access to recommended personal protective equipment.

Justification for Emergency Use of Drugs During the COVID‑19 Pandemic:

There is currently an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19) caused by SARS‑CoV‑2, a novel coronavirus. The Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has:

Determined that there is a public health emergency, or significant potential for a public health emergency.
Declared that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of drugs and biological products for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19.

An EUA is an FDA authorization for the emergency use of an unapproved product or unapproved use of an approved product (i.e., drug, biological product, or device) in the United States under certain circumstances including, but not limited to, when the Secretary of HHS declares that there is a public health emergency that affects the national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad, and that involves biological agent(s) or a disease or condition that may be attributable to such agent(s).

### Guidance on forgoing life-sustaining medical treatment [^111e8hoS]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Death by neurologic criteria in children — recommended processes for the diagnosis of death by neurologic criteria in children and infants have been updated over time, and physicians should use current processes and be aware of state statutes and institutional policies that may restrict the determination in certain circumstances. Clinicians are encouraged to offer the time and guidance needed to help families understand that once death by neurologic criteria has been determined, their child has met legal criteria for death. Families' religious beliefs and practices should be acknowledged, and physicians should be knowledgeable about state laws that may honor exemptions to this determination. The process of discontinuing interventions that sustain oxygenation and tissue perfusion in a child whose death was determined by neurologic criteria, although fundamentally different from withdrawing LSMT, may be experienced similarly by families and clinicians. In addition, it is important for pediatricians to be aware of regulations about reporting imminent death to organ-procurement agencies and the need, in some instances, to sustain organ support until appropriateness for organ recovery has been established.

Phase 3 (1990–2009)

The AAMC "Project 3000 by 2000" began in 1990. 24 The goal was to enroll 3000 "underrepresented in medicine" students per year in medical schools by the year 2000. 31 Despite additional "pipeline" efforts, the program failed as year 2000 acceptees consisted of 1168 blacks, 1082 Hispanics, and 126 American Indians. 32 Nationally, it was felt that progress had been attained only by lowering admissions standards for objective academic achievements. 22

In 1996, California became the first state to ban racial and ethnic preferences through Proposition 209. This was admonished by Herbert W. Nickens, MD, and Jordan J. Cohen, MD, of the AAMC. 33 They recognized the paradigm shift to the diversity rationale that occurred with Bakke but ignored other aspects of the ruling. Continued advocacy for population parity in medical school admissions was expressed as the "commitment to mirror the society it purports to serve". Tacit acceptance of reverse discrimination was encoded in the statement, "It is in the nature of highly complex societies that citizens share burdens for which they are not personally responsible".

The voice to protect academically unqualified "underrepresented in medicine" applicants was lost with the death of Nickens in 1999. 34 Previously, Nickens and Cohen emphasized that "no one would (or should) argue for admitting a person to medical school who lacked the academic skills… necessary for succeeding in medical school, obtaining licensure, completing graduate medical education, and becoming certified in a specialty". 33 Without Nickens, Cohen continued to support racial and ethnic preferences, stating, "alternatives to affirmative action are unworkable". 34 Yet he now minimized high attrition rates for academic reasons and high unmatched rates for graduate medical education programs that had been reported for underrepresented minorities, stating, "… the price of pursuing the important goal of narrowing the diversity gap in medicine is to accept that a small portion of the limited capacity available in medical schools will be lost to potentially more qualified applicants. But… the benefits of constructing a balanced class far outweigh the cost". 34

### Recommendations for the appropriate structure, communication, and investigation of tobacco harm reduction claims. An official American Thoracic Society policy statement [^1151CrfF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Tobacco harm reduction research — risk assessment, consent, and fairness are emphasized: "Hazards of prospective population-based evaluations of tobacco harm reduction strategies may qualify as 'greater than minimal risk'. Care should be taken to assess research risks in comparison to current standards of care for reducing harm among people already weary or unwilling to quit, rather than in comparison to the no-intervention condition". "Harm reduction researchers must protect the autonomy of research subjects by discussing the unique nature of the risks of such research with those subjects and by promoting their individual understanding". Autonomy is specified as when participants "have the capacity to understand the risks they are assuming, are given the information necessary to achieve that understanding, have their understanding verified by a researcher qualified to make such an assessment, and consent voluntarily to assume the risks of the research". Unknown risks "must be included in the informed consent discussion", and "the long-term risks of harm reduction methods are not yet fully known — a fact that must be disclosed during the consent process". The policy cautions that "Human subjects may be vulnerable to coercion" and assigns a "particular responsibility of harm reduction investigators to avoid overemphasizing known benefits or minimizing unknown risks", and directs that "Harm reduction researchers should protect research subjects from unforeseen or tragic consequences of their research through fair methods that promote just outcomes", with fairness described as "a uniform process" promoting "the equitable distribution of benefits and harms".

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS RTI International prepared this report under contract to the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, U. S. Department of Health and Human Services. The authors appreciate the guidance of Emily Jones, Kirsten Beronio, and D. E. B. Potter and staff of the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight. The authors would also like to thank the individuals who participated in the key stakeholder discussions and the individuals from state departments of insurance who provided and helped interpret insurance plan documents.

The views and opinions expressed here are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views, opinions, or policies of ASPE or HHS. The authors are solely responsible for any errors. Major Findings: The current study suggestions that, on the whole, there was little evidence of differential quantitative restrictions in the 2014 plans. The findings show that there were some differences in scope and level of coverage between behavioral health and medical/surgical coverage in 2013, but these were not apparent in 2014. Our findings suggest at least two areas where further understanding is needed on parity in the individual and small group market. First, the results suggest focusing on aspects of coverage other than quantitative restrictions, such as non-quantitative treatment limitations. A second area requiring further scrutiny is whether plans' provider networks sufficiently ensure consumer access to services.

### Social determinants of health and slippery slopes in assisted dying debates: lessons from Canada [^1144iHG1]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2021). Medium credibility.

Social determinants of health

Disability and the social determinants of health

In the 2020–2021 debate over whether to remove Bill C-14's requirement that natural death be reasonably foreseeable, arguments based on the social determinants of health rose to particular prominence, 20 mostly advanced by antiassisted dying disability rights groups. These arguments may be familiar to those who have followed these debates over the years, but they might be new to people unfamiliar with arguments grounded in frameworks like the 'Vulnerable Persons Standard'or as made by groups like 'Not Dead Yet'.

Before articulating these arguments, a point about representation and terminology is required. While many antiassisted dying disability rights activist groups have voiced these arguments, it is unclear to what extent these — often powerful — voices are representative of the views held by persons with disabilities writ large. In 2021, Dying with Dignity Canada, an assisted dying activist group, commissioned a survey of Canadians' views on proposed changes to Canada's assisted dying law. The survey showed no meaningful differences between Canadians identifying/not identifying as disabled in terms of their support for a permissive access regime. Sixty per cent of people with disabilities (and 69% of all surveyed) wanted to remove the requirement that death be reasonably foreseeable. It is also worth emphasising that the plaintiffs in Lamb v. Canada (the British Columbia case)and Truchon v. Canada (the Quebec case) xii were people with disabilities as their sole underlying condition fighting for the removal of the reasonably foreseeable requirement. The survey we cite was commissioned by a proassisted dying advocacy group. However, we could find no other surveys. And of course, the plaintiffs are merely individuals; their existence and actions do not tell us about the views of other persons with disabilities. However, while we cannot claim that all persons with disabilities support removing reasonably foreseeable, we note that disability activist groups that oppose removing reasonably foreseeable do not speak for all persons with disabilities. Indeed, we cannot know how many or what proportion they speak for. Therefore, rather than perpetuate the misperception that persons with disabilities are overwhelmingly (or even majority) opposed to assisted dying being available to persons with disabilities as their sole underlying medical condition by saying 'persons with disabilities arguments' or 'disability rights groups', we say 'anti-MAiD disability rights activist group arguments' and related variants.
