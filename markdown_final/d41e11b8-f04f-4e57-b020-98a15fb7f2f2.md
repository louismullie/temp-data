## Question

Treatment for coccidiodes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about coccidioidomycosis treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical spectrum and how it drives treatment decisions. Then, I should verify indications for treatment versus observation in primary pulmonary disease. Next, I will review first-line agents, dosing, and duration across syndromes. After that, I need to examine special populations, including pregnancy, HIV, transplant, and pediatrics. I will then consider management of complications such as cavities, rupture, and hydrocephalus. Finally, I should confirm monitoring, endpoints, and salvage strategies, and close with a concise synthesis that aligns with guidelines and contemporary evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical spectrum because treatment hinges on it: primary pulmonary disease ranges from mild to severe, chronic pulmonary disease implies symptoms beyond three months, disseminated disease involves extrapulmonary sites, and coccidioidal meningitis is a distinct, high-stakes entity requiring lifelong therapy; I should also remember that many mild cases resolve spontaneously, which tempers overtreatment tendencies [^1153Aq46] [^114MCUDs] [^114xE7s6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treating everyone with primary pulmonary disease; I need to check who actually benefits from antifungals versus observation. For immunocompetent patients with mild, nondebilitating symptoms or those substantially improved by diagnosis, observation with education, close follow-up, and reconditioning is appropriate, and no randomized trial shows that azoles shorten early illness or prevent complications in uncomplicated cases, so I should avoid reflexive therapy here [^115cWmJW] [^113dgWeG] [^116ErquD].

> I should confirm the triggers to treat primary pulmonary disease: significantly debilitating illness, extensive pulmonary involvement, diabetes or frailty, and some experts include African or Filipino ancestry; in these settings, I need to start an oral azole, typically fluconazole at 400 mg daily, with some experts using 800 mg daily, and continue for about 3–6 months or longer until symptoms, inflammatory markers, radiographs, and serologies stabilize, noting that complete serologic resolution is not required to stop therapy [^113SizSA] [^112Usdxh] [^1139ogeK].

> Wait, let me verify the duration nuance for chronic pulmonary disease; ATS suggests a minimum of 12–18 months for chronic coccidioidomycosis, and IDSA notes that responses are often partial with substantial relapse after discontinuation, so I should plan for prolonged therapy and counsel patients accordingly [^11228YmR] [^11228YmR].

> Next, I should review disseminated non-CNS disease. I need to ensure I start an oral azole promptly, with fluconazole 400–800 mg daily or itraconazole 200 mg twice daily as reasonable options, and I should individualize duration based on severity and host factors, recognizing that many patients require months to years of therapy and that cure is uncommon, necessitating suppressive strategies in some cases [^1118VGbq] [^113EUZNc].

> For coccidioidal meningitis, I should double-check that fluconazole 400–1200 mg daily is first-line and that doses below 400 mg are inadequate; importantly, azoles suppress rather than cure, so lifelong therapy is recommended to mitigate the high relapse risk, and I must not discontinue after CSF normalization alone [^112wFQBL] [^112D7W2j] [^116EWMGT].

> Let me consider pregnancy carefully because teratogenicity matters. In the first trimester, for nonmeningeal disease I should prefer intravenous amphotericin B and avoid azoles; after the first trimester, fluconazole can be considered with counseling, and for meningeal disease in the first trimester, intrathecal amphotericin B is recommended, with transition to fluconazole thereafter; I should also avoid breastfeeding on non-fluconazole azoles and coordinate close serologic monitoring throughout pregnancy [^111Y7cMq] [^1155GdGi] [^111pXuCz].

> I will now examine HIV-specific management. For patients with CD4 counts less than 250 cells/μL who have active coccidioidomycosis, I should treat and continue therapy until CD4 is at least 250 and stable; for severe or diffuse pulmonary disease or disseminated infection, amphotericin B is preferred initially until improvement, then step down to a triazole; for meningitis, lifelong fluconazole is required, and I should coordinate ART timing, delaying ART 4–6 weeks in severely immunosuppressed patients with CNS or disseminated disease to reduce IRIS risk [^1131g4yp] [^1156ySAv] [^114f3FE9] [^1172JH2F].

> But wait, what if the patient is a transplant recipient or on biologics; I need to ensure I screen for prior coccidioidal exposure and reduce immunosuppression when feasible during severe infection, start fluconazole 400 mg daily for stable disease, and use amphotericin B for severe or rapidly progressive disease, followed by prolonged azole therapy and consideration of suppressive maintenance to prevent relapse [^115MvWDg] [^111Et68P] [^113qwuix] [^113gH46b].

> For pediatrics, I should confirm that fluconazole is the azole of choice and that infants with suspected disease should receive empiric fluconazole 6–12 mg/kg daily until the diagnosis is excluded; I also need to remember that serology in early infancy can be misleading, so clinical judgment and repeat testing are essential [^114UVnPq] [^111pXuCz].

> Next, I should review management of pulmonary cavities and complications. Asymptomatic cavities or nodules generally do not require antifungal therapy, but symptomatic chronic cavitary disease warrants prolonged azole therapy; if a cavity ruptures, I should treat with high-dose fluconazole and consider surgical decortication or resection in selected cases, and for persistent symptomatic cavities despite therapy, surgical consultation is reasonable [^116LcLn9] [^113HYWmb] [^114MCUDs] [^116S7EfD] [^116ugJBn].

> I need to check CNS complications, especially hydrocephalus, because management changes outcomes. In coccidioidal meningitis with elevated intracranial pressure, serial therapeutic lumbar punctures are indicated, and if hydrocephalus develops, CSF shunting should be considered despite antifungal therapy, ideally in consultation with neurosurgery and infectious diseases specialists [^11612zg7] [^117KPEqB].

> Let me verify salvage options when azoles fail or are not tolerated. Posaconazole has shown activity as salvage therapy in small series, and in meningitis I can escalate fluconazole to 800–1200 mg daily, switch to itraconazole with attention to absorption, or use intrathecal amphotericin B as rescue; I should also remember that itraconazole may be preferred for bone and joint disease in some contexts [^115raYqR] [^112jbvhk] [^114N6dhf] [^113fdR9k].

> I should confirm monitoring and endpoints to avoid premature discontinuation. For uncomplicated pulmonary disease, I will follow symptoms, inflammatory markers, radiographs, and serologies, stopping only when these are stable even if serology remains positive; for meningitis, I will track CSF parameters and clinical status and continue therapy for life given relapse risk; for chronic pulmonary disease, I will plan for at least a year and often longer, counseling that recurrences are common [^112Usdxh] [^112D7W2j] [^116bTt9y].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said amphotericin B is broadly effective for CNS disease; I should correct that. Intravenous amphotericin B has not shown efficacy for coccidioidal meningitis, whereas intrathecal amphotericin B is used as adjunct or salvage, so I must not substitute IV amphotericin B for CNS-directed therapy in meningitis [^116zJ7p1].

> Finally, I will synthesize a practical approach. For mild primary pulmonary disease in immunocompetent hosts, observe with education and reconditioning; for moderate to severe disease or those with risk factors, treat with fluconazole 400–800 mg daily for 3–6 months or longer until stability; for chronic pulmonary disease, plan 12–18 months or more; for disseminated non-CNS disease, use fluconazole or itraconazole for months to years; for meningitis, use fluconazole 400–1200 mg daily lifelong; tailor for pregnancy, HIV, transplant, and pediatrics, and escalate or add amphotericin B in severe or refractory cases while coordinating multidisciplinary care [^1153Aq46] [^116ErquD] [^114xE7s6].

---

Treatment for coccidioidomycosis is tailored to disease severity, immune status, and site of infection [^115EG68J]. For mild primary pulmonary disease in immunocompetent patients, observation and supportive care are appropriate [^115cWmJW]; **fluconazole 400 mg daily** is first-line therapy for moderate to severe or disseminated disease, with itraconazole as an alternative [^111Mr7Yh] [^11228YmR] [^1118VGbq]. Amphotericin B is reserved for severe or life-threatening cases, including pregnancy and CNS disease [^11228YmR] [^111Y7cMq] [^116zJ7p1] [^1156ySAv]. Coccidioidal meningitis requires **lifelong fluconazole** therapy [^112D7W2j] [^1172JH2F], and surgical intervention is indicated for persistent cavities or complications [^116ugJBn]. Treatment duration ranges from 3–6 months for uncomplicated pulmonary disease to lifelong for meningitis, with close monitoring for relapse and adverse effects [^112Usdxh] [^112D7W2j].

---

## Indications for treatment

Treatment decisions are based on **clinical severity, immune status, and disease site** [^notfound]:

- **Uncomplicated primary pulmonary disease**: Observation and supportive care for immunocompetent patients with mild symptoms [^115cWmJW] [^116ErquD].
- **Moderate to severe pulmonary disease**: Fluconazole 400 mg daily for 3–6 months [^111Mr7Yh] [^115Fjwdu].
- **Disseminated disease**: Fluconazole 400–800 mg daily; amphotericin B for severe or refractory cases [^1118VGbq] [^11532t5f].
- **Coccidioidal meningitis**: Lifelong fluconazole 400–800 mg daily [^112D7W2j] [^116EWMGT].
- **Pregnancy**: Amphotericin B preferred; avoid azoles in the first trimester [^111Y7cMq] [^1155GdGi].

---

## First-line antifungal agents

| **Agent** | **Indication** | **Dose** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Fluconazole | - Moderate to severe pulmonary disease <br/> - Disseminated disease <br/> - CNS disease | 400 mg daily | 3–6 months; lifelong for CNS |
| Itraconazole | Alternative to fluconazole | 200 mg twice daily | 3–6 months |
| Amphotericin B | - Severe or life-threatening disease <br/> - Pregnancy <br/> - CNS disease | 0.5–1.0 mg/kg IV daily | Until clinical improvement, then switch to azole |

---

## Duration of therapy

- **Uncomplicated pulmonary disease**: 3–6 months [^112Usdxh] [^115Fjwdu].
- **Disseminated disease**: 6–12 months, often longer [^1118VGbq] [^113wVHUm].
- **Coccidioidal meningitis**: Lifelong therapy [^112D7W2j] [^1172JH2F].

---

## Management of complications

- **Pulmonary cavities**: Observe if asymptomatic; surgery for persistent symptoms or complications [^111cEB7G] [^116ugJBn].
- **Ruptured cavity**: Surgical intervention and antifungal therapy [^116Dsu2H] [^116S7EfD].
- **Hydrocephalus**: CSF shunting in addition to antifungal therapy [^117KPEqB].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular clinical assessments, serologic testing, and imaging are essential to track response and detect relapse [^115rjCtF] [^112Usdxh]. Patients should be monitored for adverse effects — particularly hepatotoxicity with azoles and nephrotoxicity with amphotericin B — and therapy adjusted based on clinical response, serology, and imaging [^112Usdxh].

---

## Special populations

- **Pregnancy**: Amphotericin B preferred; avoid azoles in the first trimester [^111Y7cMq] [^1155GdGi].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: Longer therapy and closer monitoring [^113wVHUm] [^1131g4yp].
- **Pediatric patients**: Fluconazole 6–12 mg/kg daily [^114UVnPq] [^111pXuCz].

---

## Emerging therapies and research

Posaconazole and voriconazole are under study for refractory cases, and clinical trials are evaluating new antifungal agents and combination therapies [^115raYqR]. Research also focuses on improving diagnostics and understanding host–pathogen interactions to guide therapy [^116mvxwD].

---

Treatment for coccidioidomycosis is individualized based on disease severity, immune status, and site of infection, with fluconazole as first-line therapy and amphotericin B for severe cases. Lifelong therapy is required for meningitis, and **regular monitoring is essential** to manage relapse and adverse effects [^1153Aq46].

It is important to realize that guidelines cannot always account for individual variation among patients. They are not intended to supplant physician judgment with respect to particular patients or special clinical situations. Infectious Diseases Society of America considers adherence to these guidelines to be voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding their application to be made by the physician in the light of each patient's individual circumstances. Coccidioidomycosis, also known as San Joaquin Valley fever, is a systemic infection endemic to parts of the southwestern United States and elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere. Residence in and recent travel to these areas are critical elements for the accurate recognition of patients who develop this infection. In this practice guideline, we have organized our recommendations to address actionable questions concerning the entire spectrum of clinical syndromes. These can range from initial pulmonary infection, which eventually resolves whether or not antifungal therapy is administered, to a variety of pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications. Additional recommendations address management of coccidioidomycosis occurring for special at-risk populations. Finally, preemptive management strategies are outlined in certain at-risk populations and after unintentional laboratory exposure.

Antifungal treatment options — uncomplicated coccidioidal pneumonia: For early uncomplicated coccidioidal infection, the usual adult fluconazole dose is 400 mg daily, and some experts would recommend 800 mg daily. Many experts would recommend a treatment duration ranging from 3 to 6 months or longer, and treatment can be discontinued when signs, symptoms, and inflammatory markers have resolved and serologies and radiographs have stabilized; complete serological resolution is not necessary to discontinue medications. Whether or not antifungal therapy is initiated, all patients will benefit from other elements of a management plan, and no clinical studies exist to guide the optimal dose or duration for primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis.

Coccidioidomycosis in patients with HIV — primary prevention, treatment thresholds, and monitoring: Antifungal prophylaxis is not recommended to prevent coccidioidomycosis in patients infected with HIV living in coccidioidal-endemic regions (strong, moderate). Antifungal therapy is recommended for all patients with HIV infection with clinical evidence of coccidioidomycosis and a peripheral blood CD4+ T-lymphocyte count < 250 cells/μL (strong, moderate), and therapy should be continued as long as the peripheral CD4+ T-lymphocyte count remains < 250 cells/μL (strong, low). For patients with peripheral CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts ≥ 250 cells/μL, clinical management should occur in the same manner as for patients without HIV infection, including discontinuing antifungal therapy in appropriate situations (strong, moderate). Within coccidioidal-endemic regions, patients should receive yearly serologic screening and chest radiography for coccidioidomycosis (strong, low), whereas outside coccidioidal-endemic regions serologic screening is not recommended (strong, moderate). Although data are lacking, pediatric patients with HIV infection and coccidioidomycosis should be managed in a manner similar to adult patients (strong, very low).

### Treatment for early, uncomplicated coccidioidomycosis: what is success? [^111QYiG7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The care of primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis remains challenging. Such infections produce a variety of signs, symptoms, and serologic responses that cause morbidity in patients and concern in treating clinicians for the possibility of extrapulmonary dissemination. Illness may be due to ongoing fungal growth that produces acute inflammatory responses, resulting in tissue damage and necrosis, and for this, administering an antifungal drug may be of benefit. In contrast, convalescence may be prolonged by other immunologic reactions to infection, even after fungal replication has been arrested, and in those situations, antifungal therapy is unlikely to yield clinical improvement. In this presentation, we discuss what findings are clinical indicators of fungal growth and what other sequelae are not. Understanding these differences provides a rational management strategy for deciding when to continue, discontinue, or reinstitute antifungal treatments.

### Review of clinical and laboratory diagnostics for coccidioidomycosis [^116mvxwD]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis is a fungal disease associated with soil exposure that frequently goes undiagnosed due at least in part to its nonspecific presentation and the lack of clinical suspicion by health care providers. Currently available diagnostics for coccidioidomycosis offer qualitative results that can suffer from low specificity, while semiquantitative assays are labor-intensive and complex and can require multiple days to complete. Furthermore, significant confusion exists regarding the optimal diagnostic algorithms and appropriate usage of available diagnostic tests. This review aims to inform clinical laboratorians and treating clinicians about the current diagnostic landscape, appropriate diagnostic strategies, and future diagnostic directions for coccidioidomycosis, which is expected to become more prevalent due to increased migration into areas of endemicity and climate changes.

### Estimated burden of coccidioidomycosis [^111AssVt]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Improvements in early and accurate diagnosis are needed to enhance patient treatment and health outcomes and advance characterization of disease burden. Overall, rates of coccidioidomycosis testing are low for patients presenting with CAP, which can lead to low perceived prevalence despite reports that Coccidioides species cause approximately 15% to 30% of CAP in certain endemic regions. Testing rates are higher in areas where Coccidioides is known to reside in the soil, but it is important to retain clinical suspicion in regions outside the known endemic range to account for travel-associated cases or unexpected local acquisition. Increased awareness nationwide is needed among clinicians and the general public, as patients with knowledge of coccidioidomycosis may be more likely to be diagnosed earlier than those unfamiliar with the disease. Prompt diagnosis can accelerate proper disease management to mitigate the effect of coccidioidomycosis on activities of daily living and help to reduce the financial burden of unnecessary health care visits and ineffective antibacterial treatment.

Key Points

Question

What is the annual burden of incident symptomatic coccidioidomycosis cases in the US?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study using 2019 reported case data, models estimated the occurrence of 206 000 to 360 000 incident symptomatic cases of coccidioidomycosis in 2019 in the US, 10 to 18 times the number of cases reported through national surveillance. This study estimated 18 000 to 28 000 coccidioidomycosis-associated hospitalizations and 700 to 1100 coccidioidomycosis-associated deaths in 2019 nationwide.

Meaning

These findings suggest that coccidioidomycosis burden estimates substantially exceed nationally reported case counts, highlighting the need for improved awareness, education, diagnostic testing practices, and reporting to inform public health efforts and achieve better patient outcomes.

### Increase in reported coccidioidomycosis – United States, 1998–2011 [^114rSu49]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Further investigation is needed to determine how much of the observed increase in coccidioidomycosis incidence is artifactual. Nevertheless, health-care providers should be alert for coccidioidomycosis among patients of all ages who live in or have traveled to endemic areas. Persons in endemic areas should consider trying to reduce exposure to dusty air, which might contain Coccidioides spp. spores. However, because there are currently no proven preventive measures for coccidioidomycosis, additional research into strategies that reduce the incidence or morbidity of this infection is warranted. Specifically, the role of antifungal treatment for primary pulmonary disease remains controversial and deserves further exploration, although treatment is recommended in certain patient groups, particularly those at high risk for severe disease. Because the symptoms of coccidioidomycosis mimic those of other community-acquired respiratory illnesses, patients often experience delays in testing and diagnosis and receive unnecessary antibiotics; however, patients who know about coccidioidomycosis are more likely to request testing and receive a diagnosis sooner than those who are not familiar with the disease. Therefore, promoting increased community and health-care provider awareness of this infection continues to be an important role for public health officials.

Introduction — approximate annual burden and trends in the United States: of the estimated 150 000 infections that occur annually, 50 000 likely produce an illness warranting medical attention, 10 000–20 000 are diagnosed and reported, 2000–3000 produce pulmonary sequelae, 600–1000 disseminate hematogenously, and 160 result in death; from 1998 to 2011, cases reported from endemic states have risen 10-fold; in patients with specific gene mutations that alter immunologic responses, the risk of disseminated infection can be as high as 75%, a striking increase from what would ordinarily be approximately a 1% risk.

Primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis — natural history and comparative observational outcomes: In a survey of endemic-area clinicians, among 354 patients with primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis, 325 (92%) recovered without complication and 1 had fatal CM; at that time, no effective antifungal treatment was available. In an observational Veterans Administration study of early infection, treated (n = 54) vs untreated (n = 51) fluconazole cohorts had similar time to at least 50% symptom improvement (95 days vs 98 days; p = 0.899), and none of the 50 untreated patients had progressive, recurrent, or disseminated infection, whereas among the 54 treated patients, 8 had documented recurrence of pulmonary symptoms or extrapulmonary complications after treatment discontinuation, with 1 meningitis occurring 2 years after discontinuation. In another prospective observational study of otherwise healthy adults with mild to moderate disease, 20 of 36 (56%) received antifungal treatment and 16 of 36 (44%) received no antifungal treatment, and the treated group did not reach primary (50% drop in symptom score) or secondary endpoints faster than the untreated group. No randomized trials exist to assess whether antifungal treatment shortens early uncomplicated illness or prevents later complications, and the optimal dose or duration of such treatment has not been established.

Coccidioidomycosis laboratory exposure — follow‑up guidance indicates that exposed individuals should be followed for a minimum of 6 weeks, which includes the incubation period for coccidioidal infection of 1–4 weeks, with consideration of extended follow‑up for several months depending on clinical circumstances. Symptomatic individuals should be evaluated by a clinician who is informed of the possible exposure to ensure appropriate diagnostic testing.

IDSA coccidioidomycosis — initiation of antifungal therapy in newly diagnosed primary pulmonary disease: We recommend initiating antifungal treatment for patients who, at the time of diagnosis, have significantly debilitating illness (strong, low). For patients at the time of diagnosis with extensive pulmonary involvement, with concurrent diabetes, or who are otherwise frail because of age or comorbidities, we recommend initiating antifungal treatment (strong, low); some experts would also include African or Filipino ancestry as indications for treatment. If treatment is begun in nonpregnant adults, the treatment should be an orally absorbed azole antifungal (eg, fluconazole) at a daily dose of ≥ 400 mg (strong, low).

Primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis — expert severity indicators and treatment course: Commonly used indicators to judge severity include any 1 of the following: weight loss of > 10%, intense night sweats persisting for > 3 weeks, infiltrates involving more than half of 1 lung or portions of both lungs, prominent or persistent hilar adenopathy, anticoccidioidal CF antibody titers in excess of 1:16, inability to work, or symptoms that persist for > 2 months, and such criteria have not been subjected to scientific study. Although the duration is not certain, most experts would recommend that treatment is continued from 3 to 6 months or longer, depending on the clinical response. For patients with concurrent diabetes or who are otherwise frail because of age or comorbidities, we also recommend initiating antifungal treatment.

Disseminated coccidioidomycosis — diagnostic approach prioritizes tissue confirmation over serologic titers: "Because of this variability, the diagnosis or lack of diagnosis of disseminated coccidioidal infection that is based solely on CF antibody titers is tenuous at best". "The diagnosis of disseminated coccidioidomycosis should usually rely on the histopathologic identification in or fungal isolation from an extrapulmonary lesion". "However, in most cases, direct sampling of 1 or more extrapulmonary lesions is justified because of the implications that this diagnosis has for future management".

IDSA 2016 coccidioidomycosis — recommendations for neonates and breastfeeding: We recommend against coccidioidal serologic tests for infants during the first 3 months of life, and positive tests should be interpreted with caution during the first year of life (strong, moderate). Empiric therapy with fluconazole at 6–12 mg/kg daily is recommended for infants suspected of coccidioidomycosis and should continue until the diagnosis has been ruled out (strong, low). Breastfeeding is not recommended for mothers on azole antifungals other than fluconazole (strong, moderate).

### 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guideline for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis [^111Y7cMq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2016 coccidioidomycosis — recommendations for pregnant women: For initial nonmeningeal infection in the first trimester, intravenous AmB is recommended (strong, moderate); other options include no therapy with close monitoring (weak, low) or an azole antifungal after educating the mother (weak, low). After the first trimester, an azole antifungal can be considered (strong, low), with the alternative of intravenous AmB throughout pregnancy (weak, moderate). For CM in the first trimester, intrathecal AmB is recommended (strong, moderate); after the first trimester, an azole antifungal, such as fluconazole or itraconazole, can be prescribed (strong, low). Among women with prior coccidioidomycosis not on therapy, the risk of reactivation is low and antifungal therapy is not recommended (strong, moderate); for such women, close follow-up with coccidioidal serologic testing at the initial visit and every 6–12 weeks throughout pregnancy should be performed (strong, moderate). For nonmeningeal disease in remission on an azole when pregnancy begins, azole therapy may be discontinued with clinical and serological monitoring every 4–6 weeks (weak, low), or azole therapy may be stopped and intravenous AmB started in the first trimester, changing back to an azole after the first trimester (strong, low). For pregnant women with CM already on an azole, azole therapy should be stopped for the first trimester due to teratogenicity risk (strong, moderate) and intrathecal AmB can be initiated, especially if meningeal signs and symptoms are present (strong, moderate); azole therapy may then be restarted in the second trimester (weak, low) or intrathecal AmB continued throughout gestation (weak, low). An alternative is to continue azole therapy throughout with informed maternal agreement (weak, low), and a final alternative is to stop all therapy during pregnancy and restart in the second or third trimester (weak, very low), though some experts do not recommend it because of relapse risk. Febrile pulmonary illness in pregnancy in endemic or appropriately traveled women should be evaluated for active coccidioidomycosis, including chest radiograph and coccidioidal serology and cultures (strong, moderate).

### Coccidioidomycosis [^114B16BS]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

The difficulties in managing this potentially horrific disease, with its myriad manifestations, are immense, because host factors dramatically impact outcome. Coccidioidomycosis should warrant great respect among clinicians, because, even with dramatic improvements in therapies, outcomes remain poor. Although there have been outstanding successes with these new therapies, tragic losses after years of immense patient suffering still occur. Coccidioidomycosis is a geographically restricted fungus but is one that inflicts tremendous suffering on affected patients. In addition, because of travel and the influx of susceptible hosts, dramatic increases in patients at risk for infection are seen throughout the southwest United States. The extended-spectrum azoles, such as posaconazole and voriconazole, may prove to be more efficacious in the treatment of coccidioidomycosis than prior agents, including amphotericin B, fluconazole, and itraconazole. Additional resources are needed to conduct randomised, controlled clinical trials for the treatment of this disease.

### Coccidioidomycosis [^116C2PMv]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis, caused by the dimorphic pathogenic fungi Coccidioides immitis and Coccidioides posadassi, is endemic to the southwestern United states and Central and South America. The incidence of coccidioidomycosis continues to increase. Coccidioidomycosis is typically a self-limiting influenza-like respiratory illness; however, it can lead to disseminated disease outside of the lungs. Not all nondisseminated cases require therapy, but antifungal therapy is typically beneficial requiring treatment ranging from months to lifelong. Clinical factors related to treatment decisions include severity of symptoms, radiography, coccidioidomycosis serologic results, and concurrent medical problems including immunosuppression. This review summarizes the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment options.

### Coccidioidomycosis: case report and update on diagnosis and management [^116Mu8YM]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis is a disease known for its endemicity to the Southwest United States. However, given the current trends of more frequent tourist and business travel, an increasing number of coccidioidomycosis infections are being seen in patients in other areas of the United States. Because the majority of patients with disseminated disease experience cutaneous manifestations, dermatologists can be of primary importance in the diagnosis of this disease. We report a case of coccidioidomycosis manifesting as granulomatous cutaneous nodules on the face of an otherwise healthy white man. We attempt to provide an update on the diagnosis, management, and treatment of patients who present with cutaneous lesions caused by coccidioidomycosis infection.

Chronic pulmonary coccidioidomycosis — azole therapy and amphotericin B (AmB): In a randomized double-blinded comparison of fluconazole 400 mg daily to itraconazole 200 mg twice daily, the clinical response after 8 months of treatment was approximately 55%, and response rates between the 2 regimens for chronic pulmonary infections were comparable. Some experts recommend higher doses of fluconazole; however, there is no evidence that higher doses are more effective. Treatment courses should be continued for at least 1 year and, in some cases, longer, but symptoms recur in approximately 30% of patients upon discontinuation. Because AmB is administered intravenously and is often accompanied by significant side effects, we recommend that AmB be reserved for patients who do not respond to azoles or in patients whose illness is so severe that it requires management in an intensive care unit.

There is no role for a dose < 400 mg daily in the adult patient without substantial renal impairment. Some experts prefer to use itraconazole 200 mg 2–4 times daily, but this requires closer monitoring to assure adequate absorption, and there are more drug–drug interactions than with fluconazole.

Asymptomatic coccidioidal cavity management — We recommend against the use of antifungal therapy for patients with an asymptomatic cavity (strong, low). Coccidioidal pneumonia can leave a thin-walled cavity as a residual in 5% of cases; in a patient who is asymptomatic and not immunosuppressed, periodic follow-up observation is recommended, and usually, periodic plain radiographs of the chest are adequate for monitoring; if cavities are very large or adjacent to the pleura, they may rupture, but this complication is surprisingly infrequent and antifungal treatment would not prevent this.

Background information about coccidioidomycosis — organism biology and early pulmonary infection are summarized as follows: Coccidioides species are dimorphic fungi that cause coccidioidomycosis, growing in the environment as mycelia that produce single-cell arthroconidia and, after mammalian infection, transforming into spherules that revert back to mycelial growth if cultured. Virtually all coccidioidal infections are initiated by inhalation of an arthroconidium, and the most common initial syndrome is that of a respiratory illness.

Coccidioidal meningitis (CM) — primary treatment recommends fluconazole 400–1200 mg orally daily for most patients with normal renal function (strong, moderate), and there is no role for a dose < 400 mg daily in adults without substantial renal impairment; some experts prefer itraconazole 200 mg 2–4 times daily but this requires closer monitoring for absorption and has more drug–drug interactions than fluconazole. Opinion varies on whether to give an initial daily dose of 400 mg or doses of 800–1200 mg every 24 hours, and itraconazole has also been used as primary therapy, usually as 200 mg every 12 hours, with fatty food and an acidic beverage to increase absorption. Intravenous AmB deoxycholate was not shown to be efficacious for CNS infection, whereas intrathecal AmB is commonly utilized as rescue therapy in azole failures; therapy is often initiated with low doses that are gradually increased, and if the disease begins to remit, de-escalation can be attempted.

Coccidioidomycosis in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and solid organ transplant recipients — initial treatment strategy and supporting evidence: For clinically stable HSCT or solid organ transplant recipients with acute or chronic pulmonary coccidioidomycosis and normal renal function, we recommend initiating treatment with fluconazole 400 mg daily or the equivalent dose based upon renal function (strong, low). For very severe and/or rapidly progressing acute pulmonary or disseminated coccidioidomycosis, we recommend the use of AmB until the patient has stabilized, followed by fluconazole (strong, low). For autologous or allogeneic HSCT or solid organ transplant recipients with extrapulmonary coccidioidomycosis, we recommend the same treatment as for non–transplant recipients (strong, very low). No randomized controlled studies exist, with reports from renal, liver, heart, lung, and small bowel transplant spanning > 50 years (1960–2012), of which 79 contain sufficient treatment/outcome details. In the absence of trials, two strategies are described: initiation of AmB with concurrent or sequential azole use, resulting in survival of 34% and 83%, respectively, and azole monotherapy, which among 21 reported cases has a cumulative reported survival of 87%.

### Managing cavitary coccidioidomycosis expert opinions for improving patient outcomes [^112eCc1h]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis, caused by the dimorphic fungi Coccidioides immitis and Coccidioides posadasii, is recognized as an increasing threat both nationally and worldwide. This is in large part secondary to the expanding range of Coccidioides species and increased international travel to endemic regions. Most individuals exposed to airborne Coccidioides organisms do not need medical attention, but approximately 30% will demonstrate primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis with signs and symptoms that mimic community-acquired pneumonia or other respiratory illnesses. Further, 5% of those with a diagnosis of pulmonary coccidioidomycosis will demonstrate serious and even life-threatening manifestations, including extrapulmonary or disseminated coccidioidomycosis. Of those who demonstrate pulmonary coccidioidomycosis, past evidence suggests that approximately 5% to 15% will experience long-term pulmonary sequelae in the form of nodules, abscesses, or cavitary lesions. These lesions may not be easily distinguished from malignancy or other infections, such as TB, and they add a substantial burden to both patients and the health care system. Despite the long-term consequences of cavitary coccidioidomycosis in some individuals, the current literature review and practice guidelines demonstrate a paucity of clear management strategies to treat these patients. In this report, we focus on cavitary lesions in coccidioidomycosis with the goal of presenting a description of the evaluation and management of their various forms, manifestations, and complications. These recommendations are derived from a multidisciplinary group of experts.

### Coccidioidomycosis [^113EUZNc]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Coccidioides immitis and C posadasii are pathogenic dimorphic fungi responsible for causing coccidioidomycosis in the Southwestern United States and Central and South America. Antifungal therapy is beneficial and entails careful periodic assessment with therapies ranging from none or short courses of therapy to prolonged antifungal therapy. Factors that influence the decision to treat are the duration or severity of infection, radiographic findings, anticomplementary titers, presence of underlying immunosuppression, and comorbidities. Cure for disseminated infection is infrequent with current treatment regimens. This review summarizes the management guidelines for various disease manifestations and reviews data on challenging cases with newer agents.

### Refractory coccidioidomycosis treated with posaconazole [^115raYqR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Disseminated coccidioidomycosis (which is caused by the endemic fungi of the genus Coccidioides) can be a life-threatening systemic fungal infection. Although conventional antifungal therapies have activity against Coccidioides, the disease can be refractory to standard therapies. Drug-associated toxicities also may limit the clinical utility of the standard antifungal drugs. In addition, relapses in patients with disseminated coccidioidomycosis are common, making long-term management of this disease challenging.

Methods

We report the outcomes of 6 patients with coccidioidomycosis who were treated with posaconazole salvage therapy after treatment with conventional antifungal therapies failed to produce sustained clinical improvement. Patients were administered posaconazole oral suspension 800 mg/day in divided doses as part of an open-label clinical trial. A modified version of the Mycoses Study Group Coccidioides scoring system was used to evaluate the burden of disease. Posaconazole therapy resulted in rapid clinical improvements in the signs and symptoms of coccidioidomycosis.

Results

At the end of therapy, 5 of 6 patients had successful outcomes. Posaconazole was well tolerated despite long-term administration (1–2 years), and 2 patients continued to receive posaconazole maintenance therapy at the time of writing.

Conclusions

The successful outcomes observed in this case series suggest that posaconazole is an effective therapy for coccidioidomycosis.

### FDA public workshop summary-coccidioidomycosis (valley fever): considerations for development of antifungal drugs [^1111tp1i]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis is a fungal disease endemic to the southwestern United States, Mexico, and Central and South America. Prevalence rates are increasing steadily, and new endemic areas of Coccidioides are emerging. Standard treatment is often administered for months to decades, and intolerance to medications and treatment failures are common. No new treatments for coccidioidomycosis have been approved in the United States in nearly 40 years. On 5 August 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration convened experts in coccidioidomycosis from academia, industry, patient groups, and other government agencies to discuss the disease landscape and strategies to facilitate product development for treatment of coccidioidomycosis. This article summarizes the key topics concerning drug development for coccidioidomycosis presented by speakers and panelists during the workshop, such as unmet need, trial designs, endpoints, incentives, research and development support, and collaborations to facilitate antifungal drug development.

### Estimated burden of coccidioidomycosis [^113CZdNb]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this cross-sectional study, we sought to provide a comprehensive and systematic estimate of coccidioidomycosis burden to raise public and clinician awareness and to inform clinical, public health, and policy decision-making. Our results highlight the need for increased awareness, accurate clinical diagnosis, and reporting to public health entities to improve patient outcomes and monitor trends over time, particularly in areas of low or unknown endemicity. Improved routine surveillance, enhanced surveillance projects, and targeted studies are essential to produce more reliable multipliers from primary data. We hope these estimates will be a first step in a long and sustained iterative effort to understand the burden of coccidioidomycosis in the US.

Ruptured coccidioidal cavities — antifungal therapy: for patients with ruptured coccidioidal cavities, oral azole therapy is recommended, and for patients who do not tolerate oral azole therapy or whose disease requires 2 or more surgical procedures for control, intravenous amphotericin B (AmB) is recommended (strong, very low). The evidence summary notes AmB was used in complex pleural disease, usually 0.5–1.0 mg/kg/day, and that nearly all patients in recent literature received oral azole therapy, most commonly fluconazole, at least 400 mg/day; there is no objective evidence defining appropriate dose or duration following surgery, and common practice is 1–3 months after an apparently successful postoperative course and a year or longer for more complicated courses.

Symptomatic chronic cavitary coccidioidal pneumonia — We recommend that patients with symptomatic chronic cavitary coccidioidal pneumonia be treated with an oral agent such as fluconazole or itraconazole (strong, moderate). Chronic coccidioidal pneumonia usually includes at least some cavitation and has been defined in clinical trials as infections that are of at least 3 months' duration; current therapies do not eradicate Coccidioides species and, in that sense, they are not curative, but symptoms usually wax and wane and patients are often chronically ill with sputum production, chest discomfort, and occasional episodes of intermittent hemoptysis.

Coccidioidal meningitis (CM) — management of failure of initial therapy recommends that in patients who clinically fail initial fluconazole therapy, higher doses are a first option (strong, moderate); alternative options are to change to another orally administered azole or to initiate intrathecal AmB therapy (strong, moderate). A combination of clinical, CSF, and potential radiographic parameters obtained on a regular basis should be used to define treatment success and failure, with CSF parameters the most important variable. If low-dose fluconazole (400 mg orally daily) was the original option, increasing to 800–1200 mg daily should be considered, and the Mycosis Study Group defined response as a decrease in baseline score by 40% without relapse while treatment was continued.

Coccidioidomycosis in pregnancy — treatment by trimester and prior disease status is outlined as follows: The development of symptomatic coccidioidomycosis during pregnancy should prompt consideration of starting administration of antifungal therapy (strong, moderate). For initial nonmeningeal infection in the first trimester, intravenous AmB is recommended (strong, moderate), with other options including no therapy with close monitoring (weak, low) or an azole antifungal after educating the mother regarding potential teratogenicity (weak, low); after the first trimester an azole antifungal, such fluconazole or itraconazole, can be considered (strong, low), and a final alternative is intravenous AmB throughout pregnancy (weak, moderate). For CM in the first trimester, intrathecal AmB is recommended (strong, moderate), and after the first trimester an azole antifungal such as fluconazole or itraconazole can be prescribed (strong, low). For women with a history of prior coccidioidomycosis not on therapy, close follow-up including obtaining coccidioidal serologic testing at the initial visit and every 6–12 weeks throughout pregnancy should be performed (strong, moderate). For women with nonmeningeal disease in remission who become pregnant while on azoles, azole antifungal therapy may be discontinued with clinical and serological monitoring every 4–6 weeks to assess for reactivation (weak, low) or stopped with initiation of intravenous AmB during the first trimester, changing back to an azole after the first trimester (strong, low). For pregnant women with CM already on azoles, azole therapy should be stopped for the first trimester to avoid the risk of teratogenicity (strong, moderate), with approaches including initiating intrathecal AmB during this period (strong, moderate), restarting azole therapy during the second trimester or continuing intrathecal AmB throughout gestation (weak, low), and an alternative of continuing azole therapy throughout gestation with informed maternal agreement (weak, low); a final alternative is to stop the azole antifungal, monitor closely during the first trimester, and restart during the second or third trimester (weak, very low), which some experts do not recommend because of relapse risk.

HIV-associated coccidioidomycosis — treatment duration and discontinuation criteria: In people who have CD4 count ≥ 250 cells/mm3, coccidioidomycosis should be managed no differently than it is in patients in the general population (AII). For focal pulmonary disease meeting the criteria, treatment with a triazole antifungal agent should continue for a minimum of 3 to 6 months (AII). For diffuse pulmonary disease or extrathoracic dissemination, antifungal therapy should continue for at least 12 months and usually much longer, and therapy should be discontinued based on clinical and immunological response and in consultation with an expert (BIII). For people with detectable HIV viremia or CD4 count < 250 cells/mm3, antifungal therapy at full dose should continue (BIII).

### Treatment of valley fever… [^114xE7s6]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Most infections go away on their own without any medication.
- People with severe infections are treated with antifungal medications.
- Most people fully recover with time. Treatment Many people who get sick with Valley fever have mild symptoms. They often get better without medication within a few months. Healthcare providers may prescribe 3–6 months of oral antifungal medication like fluconazole. This is for people with more serious infections or people with risk factors for severe infections. Severe infections People who have severe lung infections or infections that have spread to other parts of the body need antifungal treatment. These people may need to be hospitalized and for these types of infections, the course of treatment is usually longer than 6 months. Valley fever that develops into meningitis is fatal if it's not treated, so lifelong antifungal treatment is necessary for those cases.

Diagnosis Serologic tests to detect IgM and IgG antibodies are most often used to diagnose coccidioidomycosis. Enzyme immunoassay EIA is a very sensitive and commonly used method for diagnosing coccidioidomycosis. Two EIAs for detection of specific IgM and IgG antibodies against Coccidioides are currently available:

- Premier ® CoccidioidesEIA – Meridian Bioscience, Inc.
- Enzyme Immunoassay for detection of specific antibodies against Coccidioidesspp – Immuno Mycologics, Inc. Complement Fixation CF etects IgG antibodies and allows for assessment of disease severity. Lateral Flow Assay The Sona Coccidioides Antibody LFA is a rapid test. It detects the presence of total antibodies against Coccidioides spp.

Treatment and recovery No evidence from randomized trials exists to determine whether antifungal treatment for uncomplicated coccidioidal infections reduces symptom duration or prevents complications. Some infections will resolve without antifungal treatment. Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines suggest treatment for primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis in patients who:

- Are immunosuppressed
- Have severe or significantly debilitating illness
- Have diabetes or are frail because of age or comorbidities
- Are pregnant women
- Are of African or Filipino ancestry Disseminated coccidioidomycosis requires antifungal treatment, typically fluconazole or amphotericin B. For more detailed treatment guidelines, please refer to the Infectious Diseases Society of America's Practice Guidelines for the Treatment of Coccidioidomycosis.
- Improved methods for environmental detection.

To improve patient outcomes researchers are working to:

- Establish optimal treatment regimen for primary pulmonary infections.
- Develop an effective vaccine.

### Delayed diagnosis and treatment of coccidioidomycosis identified through enhanced surveillance-Riverside county, California, 2024… [^111LFPgk]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know
- Presentation Day/Time: Tuesday, April 22, 1: 20–2: 45 pm
- **Presenter**: Bethan Swift, DPhil, MSc, EIS officer assigned to the Riverside County Department of Public Health. What did we do.
- During 2019–2023, the age-adjusted rate of disease caused by the Coccidioides fungus rate in Riverside County increased from 13. 0/100, 000 people to
17. 0/100, 000 people. We piloted enhanced surveillance to identify opportunities to improve prevention and clinical management efforts. What did we find.
- We interviewed 112 of 248 people with a coccidioidomycosis case reported. Median interviewee age was 57. 5 years, the majority were male and employed, and the most common race and ethnicity was Hispanic.
- Forty percent reported working outdoors daily or most days during the two months preceding illness or testing.
- Sixty-eight percent reported symptoms; 57 were hospitalized and 10 required intensive care unit treatment.
- Interviewees had a median of four interactions with healthcare providers before coccidioidomycosis testing; 46 were prescribed antibiotics.
- Median time from first healthcare encounter to testing was 55 days. When interviewed, 50 had not received notification of their positive result. Why does it matter.
- Enhanced surveillance revealed that persons with coccidioidomycosis had delayed diagnosis and inappropriate treatment with antibiotics. Educating medical providers and the community regarding symptoms and treatment might improve health outcomes and promote antimicrobial stewardship. Abstract Category: Fungal Diseases.
