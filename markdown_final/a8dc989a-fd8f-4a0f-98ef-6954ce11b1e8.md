## Question

Where do patients usually complain of pain with greater tronchanteric bursitisi and IT band syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking where patients usually complain of pain with greater trochanteric bursitis/greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) and iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS); let's break this down step-by-step, first, I need to think about precise definitions and scope (GTPS as a spectrum vs isolated bursitis), then I should verify the classic pain epicenters and radiation patterns, next I will examine provocation factors and key physical findings, then I need to consider anatomic-biomechanical overlap and mimics, and finally I will synthesize the distinguishing clinical features and note coexisting conditions and when to image to strengthen diagnostic confidence.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't anchor on outdated terminology: GTPS has largely supplanted "isolated trochanteric bursitis" and encompasses lateral hip pain arising from gluteal tendinopathy/tears, bursitis, and IT band friction over the greater trochanter, whereas ITBS is classically an overuse lateral knee pain syndrome in runners and cyclists due to IT band irritation over the lateral femoral condyle [^113bw672] [^1176CjXJ] [^1146hGrC] [^114DVbgd].

> Wait, let me verify the GTPS pain map and hallmark findings: GTPS typically presents with lateral hip pain localized over the greater trochanter with focal posterolateral trochanteric tenderness, often radiating distally along the lateral thigh toward the knee and sometimes to the buttock or even below the knee, and symptoms are commonly aggravated by lying on the affected side, prolonged sitting, or stair climbing [^1176CjXJ] [^116pY7t9] [^116XLWPL].

> Hold on, I should double-check the ITBS pain map so I don't overgeneralize: ITBS most often presents as lateral knee pain at the lateral femoral condyle with pain provoked by repetitive knee flexion-extension (running, cycling), though some patients describe distal lateral thigh pain and, less commonly, lateral thigh pain that can mimic radiculopathy by radiating to the knee, with the epicenter remaining peri-condylar at the knee in classic cases [^1146hGrC] [^112DHt6M] [^117Pohtr] [^111Dhx7q].

> I need to ensure I integrate the anatomic rationale for overlap before drawing hard lines: the IT band originates at the lateral hip (TFL), traverses the lateral thigh, crosses over the greater trochanter, and inserts at Gerdy's tubercle, so friction and tensile load can involve both the trochanteric region and the lateral knee, and shared contributors like hip abductor weakness predispose to both GTPS and ITBS, which explains coexistence and symptom overlap in the lateral thigh corridor [^111Dhx7q] [^11371pq2].

> Let me think about the key distinctions, and I'll correct an initial simplification I nearly made: I initially thought "ITBS = knee only", but wait, although the nuance is that ITBS pain can be felt in the distal lateral thigh, the clinical epicenter is characteristically at the lateral femoral condyle near the knee, whereas GTPS pain epicenter is at the lateral hip over the greater trochanter with distal radiation, so the practical distinction remains hip-centric vs knee-centric localization on careful history and palpation, accepting that both can populate the lateral thigh space [^113bw672] [^1176CjXJ] [^1146hGrC].

> Next, I should review focused examination cues to avoid premature closure: for GTPS, point tenderness over the greater trochanter and abductor-provocation tests with possible Trendelenburg or compensated Trendelenburg suggest abductor pathology and compressive tendinopathy, whereas for ITBS, tenderness over the lateral femoral condyle with provocation by Noble or related tests during knee flexion-extension supports an IT band friction pain generator centered at the knee [^1166oqRx] [^1176CjXJ] [^112kWAdx].

> I will now examine when imaging meaningfully refines diagnosis, because I should confirm thresholds rather than ordering reflexively: for undifferentiated or persistent lateral hip pain, start with standing AP pelvis/hip radiographs and consider ultrasound or MRI if conservative therapy fails or a gluteus medius/minimus tear is suspected, whereas for ITBS, imaging is typically unnecessary unless alternative knee pathology is suspected or the course is atypical, with ultrasound sometimes helpful to assess peri-trochanteric bursae when GTPS is uncertain [^11669yDf] [^116pSqtB] [^114u77h6] [^117Pohtr].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without cross-checking against interventional and trial data that contextualize these syndromes clinically: for GTPS, fluoroscopic guidance does not improve outcomes over landmark-guided injections and shockwave therapy has RCT-level evidence for pain reduction, whereas for ITBS, a small RCT supports short-term pain reduction with corticosteroid injection at the lateral femoral condyle, consistent with the knee-localized pain generator in classic ITBS presentations [^112A3m96] [^115tKR9H] [^114DxauK] [^112DHt6M].

> Finally, synthesizing for bedside discrimination, I should confirm the clinical takeaway and consider mimics: GTPS is lateral hip pain with trochanteric point tenderness and distal radiation along the lateral thigh, often provoked by side-lying or stair climbing, while ITBS is lateral knee pain at the femoral condyle provoked by repetitive knee motion, yet both can share lateral thigh symptoms due to the IT band spanning the trochanter to the knee and can mimic lumbosacral radiculopathy, so precise palpation to identify the epicenter (hip vs knee) plus selective provocative maneuvers is the key to avoiding diagnostic drift and recognizing potential coexistence [^1176CjXJ] [^111Dhx7q] [^117Pohtr].

Patients with greater trochanteric bursitis (GTPS) typically report **lateral hip pain** [^113bw672] over the greater trochanter, often radiating down the lateral thigh [^116pY7t9] and aggravated by lying on the affected side, prolonged standing, walking, or stair climbing. By contrast, iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) causes **lateral knee pain** [^1146hGrC] over the lateral femoral epicondyle, worsened by repetitive knee flexion–extension (e.g. running or cycling) [^112DHt6M], and may radiate proximally along the lateral thigh. Thus, GTPS pain centers on the lateral hip, whereas ITBS centers on the lateral knee.

## Anatomical overview

### Greater trochanteric bursitis (GTPS)

In GTPS, the **location** is inflammation of the bursae over the greater trochanter, causing lateral hip pain [^1176CjXJ]. The **structures involved** include the gluteus medius/minimus tendons, iliotibial band, and bursae [^113bw672] [^1168VpS9].

---

### Iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS)

In ITBS, the **location** is inflammation of the distal IT band over the lateral femoral epicondyle, causing lateral knee pain [^1146hGrC]. The **structures involved** include the IT band, lateral femoral epicondyle, and the underlying bursa [^116VjxvJ].

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. Part viii: Lateral hip and thigh pain [^111Dhx7q]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) usually presents as distal lateral thigh pain, caused by friction from the iliotibial band (ITB), which rubs repeatedly over the lateral femoral epicondyle. The condition most commonly occurs in people who perform repetitive unidirectional activities such as running and cycling, have recently increased their training intensity, and who have relative hip abductor weakness. The gluteus medius muscle is the primary stabilizer of the ITB during foot-strike; therefore, weakness of the muscle can result in compensation and overuse of the tensor fascia latae. This, in turn, can lead to a shortened ITB and ITBS.

Since similar suboptimal biomechanics predispose individuals to both ITBS and greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), the two conditions can co-exist. As a result of the location of the origin and insertion of the ITB, ITBS can also mimic lumbar radicular pain by presenting as lateral thigh pain radiating to the knee. Despite the increasing age of runners, it is important to note that ITBS more commonly occurs in younger runners, and the syndrome is not commonly described in older adults. Older runners tend to be more limited by calf, Achilles, and hamstring injuries rather than knee injuries.

### Iliotibial band syndrome: Evaluation and management [^1146hGrC]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2011). Low credibility.

Iliotibial band syndrome is a common overuse injury typically seen in runners, cyclists, and military recruits. Affected patients report lateral knee pain associated with repetitive motion activities. The diagnosis is usually made based on a characteristic history and physical examination, with imaging studies reserved for cases of recalcitrant disease to rule out other pathologic entities.

- **Etiologies**: Several causes have been proposed for iliotibial band syndrome, including friction of the iliotibial band against the lateral femoral epicondyle, compression of the fat and connective tissue deep to the iliotibial band, and chronic inflammation of the iliotibial band bursa.

- **Treatment**: The mainstay of treatment is nonsurgical; however, in persistent or chronic cases, surgical management is indicated.

### Hip pain in adults: Evaluation and differential diagnosis [^113bw672]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Adults commonly present to their family physicians with hip pain, and diagnosing the cause is important for prescribing effective therapy. Hip pain is usually located anteriorly, laterally, or posteriorly. Anterior hip pain includes referred pain from intra-abdominal or intrapelvic causes; extra-articular etiologies, such as hip flexor injuries; and intra-articular etiologies. Intra-articular pain is often caused by a labral tear or femoroacetabular impingement in younger adults or osteoarthritis in older adults.

Lateral hip pain is most commonly caused by greater trochanteric pain syndrome, which includes gluteus medius tendinopathy or tear, bursitis, and iliotibial band friction. Posterior hip pain includes referred pain such as lumbar spinal pathology, deep gluteal syndrome with sciatic nerve entrapment, ischiofemoral impingement, and hamstring tendinopathy.

In addition to the history and physical examination, radiography, ultrasonography, or magnetic resonance imaging may be needed for a definitive diagnosis. Radiography of the hip and pelvis should be the initial imaging test. Ultrasound-guided anesthetic injections can aid in the diagnosis of an intra-articular cause of pain. Because femoroacetabular impingement, labral tears, and gluteus medius tendon tears typically have good surgical outcomes, advanced imaging and/or early referral may improve patient outcomes.

### Lateral hip pain: Findings from magnetic resonance imaging and clinical examination [^115yZtiV]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

This prospective cross-sectional study aims to examine the radiological and physical therapy diagnoses of lateral hip pain (LHP) and determine the validity of selected clinical variables for predicting gluteal tendon pathology.

LHP is frequently encountered by clinicians, necessitating further investigation to establish the specific pathologies implicated and to identify useful clinical tests for assessment. In this study, forty patients with unilateral LHP underwent a physical therapy examination followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. Three radiologists analyzed the images of both hips for pathology signs, examining interobserver reliability, the agreement between physical therapy and radiological diagnoses, and the validity of clinical tests.

The results indicated that gluteus medius tendon pathology, bursitis, osteoarthritis, and gluteal muscle atrophy (particularly gluteus minimus) were implicated in the imaging report of LHP. Abnormalities were prevalent in symptomatic hips and also identified in asymptomatic hips, especially in cases of bursitis. The strength of agreement between radiologists was variable, and little agreement existed between the physical therapy and radiological diagnoses. Of the 26 clinical variables examined in relation to gluteal tendon pathology, nine had likelihood ratios above 2.0 or below 0.5, but the 95% confidence intervals were large.

The diagnosis of LHP remains challenging, as current findings show limited agreement between different diagnostic approaches.

### Pathogenesis and contemporary diagnoses for lateral hip pain: A scoping review [^1168VpS9]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

Recent advances in diagnostic imaging techniques and soft tissue endoscopy now allow for precise diagnosis and management of extra-articular hip pathology. The aim of this scoping review is to present an evidence-based update of the relevant literature focusing only on the pathoanatomy, clinical assessment, and the diagnosis of pathology in the peritrochanteric space.

A literature search was performed on PubMed to include articles which reported on the anatomy and diagnosis of greater trochanteric pain syndrome, trochanteric bursitis, gluteus medius tears, and external snapping hip syndrome.

A total of 542 studies were identified, of which 49 articles were included for full-text analysis for the scoping review. Peritrochanteric space pathology can be broadly classified into:

- **Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS)**
- **Abductor tears**
- **External snapping hip syndrome**

Anatomically, the gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and tensor fascia lata work in conjunction to abduct and internally rotate the hip. The anterolateral part of the gluteus medius tendon is more prone to tears due to a thin tendinous portion. Increased acetabular anteversion has also been shown to be associated with gluteal and trochanteric bursitis.

In terms of clinical examination, tests found to be most useful for assisting in the diagnosis of lateral hip pain include the single-leg stance, resisted external derotation of the hip, hip lag sign, and the Trendelenburg's test. Dynamic ultrasound, along with guided injections and MRI scans, assist in differentiating the pathology further.

### Arthroscopic anatomy and surgical techniques for peritrochanteric space disorders in the hip [^11554DR2]. Arthroscopy (2007). Low credibility.

Disorders of the lateral or peritrochanteric space, often grouped into the greater trochanteric pain syndrome, include recalcitrant trochanteric bursitis, external snapping iliotibial band, and gluteus medius and minimus tears, which are now being treated endoscopically. We outline the endoscopic anatomy of the peritrochanteric space of the hip and describe surgical techniques for the treatment of these entities.

Proper portal placement is key in understanding the peritrochanteric space and should be first oriented at the gluteus maximus insertion into the linea aspera as well as the vastus lateralis. When tears of the gluteus medius and minimus are encountered, suture anchors can be placed into the footprint of the abductor tendons in a standard arthroscopic fashion.

Our initial experience indicates that recalcitrant trochanteric bursitis, external coxa saltans, and focal, isolated tears of the gluteus medius and minimus tendon may be successfully treated with arthroscopic bursectomy, iliotibial band release, decompression of the peritrochanteric space, and suture anchor tendon repair to the greater trochanter, respectively.

### Greater trochanteric pain syndrome [^1176CjXJ]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2016). Low credibility.

Patients who experience lateral hip pain have historically been diagnosed with trochanteric bursitis and treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, corticosteroid injections, and physical therapy. Although this strategy is effective for most patients, a substantial number continue to experience pain and functional limitations. Over the past decade, our understanding of disorders occurring in the peritrochanteric space has increased dramatically. Greater trochanteric pain syndrome encompasses trochanteric bursitis, external coxa saltans (i.e. snapping hip), and abductor tendinopathy. A thorough understanding of the anatomy, examination findings, and imaging characteristics aids the clinician in treating these patients. Open and endoscopic treatment options are available for use when nonsurgical treatment is unsuccessful.

### Cooled radiofrequency ablation of the trochanteric branch of the nervus femoralis to treat greater trochanteric pain syndrome [^1115pPPf]. Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome is a common cause of lateral hip pain. Corticosteroid injections are commonly utilized as nonsurgical interventions; however, they are not effective for all patients. This technical case report describes a method for treating greater trochanteric pain syndrome by utilizing cooled radiofrequency ablation. The trochanteric branch of the nervus femoralis is identified as providing sensory innervation to the greater trochanter and its surrounding structures. We have identified fluoroscopic targets to block the nerve and perform cooled radiofrequency ablation. We present two patient cases which demonstrated significant pain relief of greater trochanteric pain syndrome with this treatment.

Cooled radiofrequency ablation of the trochanteric branch of the nervus femoralis is a potential treatment for greater trochanteric pain syndrome. This procedure provides a potential steroid-sparing interventional treatment based on reproducible fluoroscopic landmarks.

### Arthroscopic management of greater trochanter pain syndrome and abductor tears has demonstrated promising results in terms of improvement in pain scores and functional outcomes: a scoping review [^116E3CPH]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) refers to the constellation of signs and symptoms related to pain in the trochanteric region and has recently replaced the previously ubiquitous term of 'greater trochanteric bursitis'. GTPS is common, particularly in women aged 50–79 years. The understanding and management of GTPS have expanded considerably in recent years to include management with arthroscopic and endoscopic techniques in recalcitrant cases. The purpose of this scoping literature review was to summarize the evidence on arthroscopic management of GTPS, including sources of evidence, key concepts, and gaps in the literature.

- **Methods**: A thorough electronic database search included studies published from 2009 to June 14, 2020. A total of 52 peer-reviewed articles were identified within the literature on arthroscopic or endoscopic management of GTPS.

- **Results**: Of the 52 identified papers, 12 were technique descriptions, 10 papers were review articles, and 30 papers were original clinical papers. Of the 30 clinical papers, 24 (80%) were of level IV evidence, 5 (17%) were of level III evidence, and 1 (3%) was level II evidence. Among the 30 clinical studies, 988 patients were included with 761 (77%) female. Indications for surgical management included a failed trial of conservative management in all 30 studies, typically following a period of 3–6 months. Surgical management consisted of arthroscopic/endoscopic abductor tendon repair in 16 (53%) studies, arthroscopic/endoscopic bursectomy and iliotibial band release in 12 (40%) studies, and arthroscopi.

### Deep gluteal pain in orthopaedics: A challenging diagnosis [^115yEaX5]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2021). Low credibility.

Identifying the specific source of gluteal pain can often elude even the most seasoned orthopaedic diagnosticians. Patients frequently present with a protracted course of symptoms, and failure to successfully identify and treat the underlying etiology leads to frustration for both patient and clinician. Pain deep in the buttocks can arise from compression, inflammation, or injury of one or more structures in this anatomically dense area. While sacroiliitis, hip arthritis, and trochanteric bursitis may masquerade as gluteal pain, sciatic nerve irritation in its various presentations accounts for a substantial percentage of cases.

- **Differential diagnosis**: Deep gluteal syndrome, hamstring syndrome, and ischiofemoral impingement can have overlapping presentations but can be differentiated by clinical examination and judiciously placed diagnostic corticosteroid injections.
- **Treatment options**: Although nonsurgical management, including physical therapy, relative rest, and injections, represents the mainstay of treatment, open and endoscopic surgical approaches have yielded encouraging success rates in refractory cases.

### Comparison of fluoroscopically guided and blind corticosteroid injections for greater trochanteric pain syndrome: Multicentre randomised controlled trial [^112A3m96]. BMJ (2009). High credibility.

The principal finding of this study suggests that the use of fluoroscopy does not improve outcomes in patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome who receive corticosteroid injections. This is consistent with our secondary finding showing comparable success rates for intra-bursal and extra-bursal injections. The results from this pilot study should not be surprising considering that most patients clinically diagnosed as having greater trochanteric pain syndrome have no radiological evidence of bursal inflammation. Even among patients with actual "trochanteric bursitis", many develop secondary pathology in adjacent tissues. In these patients, using radiographic guidance to direct the needle into the bursa in patients with an extra-bursal pain generator might be counterproductive. However, subgroup analysis did not reveal any significant differences in outcomes in fluoroscopy patients who needed more than one needle placement before injection (45% success rate at three months) and patients in whom only one injection attempt was made (44% success rate).

Our results suggest that referral to a pain specialist with fluoroscopic capability is not warranted in most patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome who present to a primary care doctor, physiatrist, or surgeon, all of whom often encounter this condition. The delay in treatment entailed by referral to a subspecialty may even be detrimental, as previous interventional studies have found an inverse relation between duration of pain and likelihood of success.

### Demystifying the clinical diagnosis of greater trochanteric pain syndrome in women [^113Wj3BB]. Journal of Women's Health (2017). Low credibility.

To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of ten clinical tests that can be used in the diagnosis of greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) in women, and to compare these clinical tests to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, a study was conducted.

Twenty-eight participants with GTPS (49.5 ± 22.0 years) and 18 asymptomatic participants (mean age ± standard deviation [SD], 52.5 ± 22.8 years) were included. A blinded physiotherapist performed ten pain provocation tests potentially diagnostic for GTPS. These tests included palpation of the greater trochanter, resisted external derotation test, modified resisted external derotation test, standard and modified Ober's tests, Patrick's or FABER test, resisted hip abduction, single-leg stance test, and the resisted hip internal rotation test. A sample of 16 symptomatic and 17 asymptomatic women underwent a hip MRI scan. Gluteal tendons were evaluated and categorized as no pathology, mild tendinosis, moderate tendinosis/partial tear, or full-thickness tear.

Clinical test analyses showed high specificity, high positive predictive value, and low to moderate sensitivity and negative predictive value for most clinical tests. All symptomatic and 88% of asymptomatic participants had pathological gluteal tendon changes on MRI, ranging from mild tendinosis to full-thickness tear.

The study concluded that the Patrick's or FABER test, palpation of the greater trochanter, resisted hip abduction, and the resisted external derotation test have the highest diagnostic test accuracy for GTPS. Tendon pathology on MRI is seen in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals.

### Management of greater trochanteric pain syndrome after total hip arthroplasty: Practice patterns and surgeon attitudes [^1138bH3L]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), or trochanteric bursitis, is classically described as pain on the lateral side of the hip that does not involve the hip joint and can be elicited clinically by palpation over the greater trochanter. Although diagnosis can be made with clinical examination alone, an ultrasound or MRI is sometimes used to increase sensitivity. GTPS can include a multitude of pathologies, including gluteus medius/minimus tears, inflammation of the trochanteric bursa, and snapping hip syndrome (coxa saltans).

Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is one of the most common and successful operations in Canada, with over 95% of patients reporting good or excellent outcomes. However, up to 17% of patients can suffer from GTPS postoperatively. GTPS can be associated with altered hip biomechanics from implant malposition or from direct injury to the abductor musculature intraoperatively. Other causes of GTPS include inflammation of the bursa overlying the greater trochanter secondary to the surgical incision; however, histopathologic studies often find little evidence of inflammation. It has been argued that a surgical approach for THA can affect the prevalence of GTPS. Advocates for using a direct anterior approach (DAA) adduce a decrease in postoperative limp and GTPS because neither the iliotibial band nor the abductor musculature is violated. Patients who suffer from GTPS postoperatively are known to have impaired functional status with reduced walking speed and slower timed up and go tests. Recalcitrant cases of GTPS may necessitate surgical débridement, increasing the risk of complications.

### 'Bald trochanter' spontaneous rupture of the conjoined tendons of the gluteus medius and minimus presenting as a trochanteric bursitis [^115Ga36R]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2004). Low credibility.

A 66-year-old white woman presented with progressive complaints of right lateral hip and thigh pain associated with a disabling limp without an antecedent history of trauma. Physical examination revealed localized pain over the right greater trochanter to palpation. A full pain-free range of motion of the right hip was associated with weakness in the hip abductors. The patient ambulated with a compensated right Trendelenburg gait.

Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a trochanteric bursitis and an effusion of the hip and a full-thickness tear of the gluteus medius muscle, with both a disruption and retraction of the tendon of an atretic gluteus minimus muscle. Conjoined tendon pathology of both the gluteus medius and minimus, as revealed by magnetic resonance examination, is probably more frequent than commonly recognized. In patients presenting with "intractable" complaints of a trochanteric bursitis and an ambulatory limp due to weakness in the hip abductors, imaging studies calling attention to a possible tendon rupture may be diagnostic.

### Management of greater trochanteric pain syndrome after total hip arthroplasty: Practice patterns and surgeon attitudes [^112xiEwE]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Global Research & Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

THA surgeons in Canada often use physical examination alone to diagnose GTPS after THA. Surgeons treat with oral anti-inflammatories, physiotherapy, or corticosteroid injections, with up to one-third of patients failing initial therapy. Although few surgeons use PRP, there is substantial interest in its potential efficacy for treating GTPS. Additional research is needed to evaluate the use of PRP, along with standardized physiotherapy and steroid injection protocols in the management of GTPS, a common and often debilitating condition.

### Hip gluteus medius and minimus endoscopic treatment results in patient satisfaction [^112BsxHK]. Arthroscopy (2020). Low credibility.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome includes a spectrum of hip pathology, such as trochanteric bursitis, gluteus medius or minimus tendinosis, partial abductor tear, full-thickness tear, and full-thickness tear plus retraction (with or without fatty atrophy). Physical diagnosis involves palpation for tenderness at the greater trochanter and evaluation for strength loss, including observation of gait. Women are significantly more likely to have a tear of the hip abductors than men. Endoscopic treatment results in patient satisfaction, improved strength and gait, and few complications. Fatty degeneration of the abductor muscles or associated scoliosis negatively affects the outcome of gluteus medius repair.

### Competitive female runners with a history of iliotibial band syndrome demonstrate atypical hip and knee kinematics [^113MGVUL]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

- **Study design**: Cross-sectional experimental laboratory study.

- **Objective**: To examine differences in running mechanics between runners who had previously sustained iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) and runners with no knee-related running injuries.

- **Background**: ITBS is the second leading cause of knee pain in runners and the most common cause of lateral knee pain. Despite its prevalence, few biomechanical studies have been conducted to better understand its aetiology. Because the iliotibial band has both femoral and tibial attachments, atypical hip and foot mechanics could result in the development of ITBS.

- **Methods**: The running mechanics of 35 females who had previously sustained ITBS were compared to 35 healthy, age-matched, and running distance-matched females. Comparisons of hip, knee, and ankle 3-dimensional kinematics and internal moments during the stance phase of running gait were measured.

- **Results**: The ITBS group exhibited significantly greater peak rearfoot invertor moment, peak knee internal rotation angle, and peak hip adduction angle compared to controls. No significant differences in peak rearfoot eversion angle, peak knee flexion angle, peak knee external rotator moment, or peak hip abductor moments were observed between groups.

- **Conclusion**: Females with a previous history of ITBS demonstrate a kinematic profile suggestive of increased stress on the iliotibial band. These results were generally similar to those reported for a prospective study conducted within the same laboratory environment.

### Comparison of fluoroscopically guided and blind corticosteroid injections for greater trochanteric pain syndrome: Multicentre randomised controlled trial [^1138dTJW]. BMJ (2009). High credibility.

Scores for each of the SF-36 scales stratified by injection method were detailed in Table 3. The only statistically significant difference was observed in the mental health scale at the one-month follow-up; patients who received a blind injection reported slightly better scores. Other differences tended to favor the blind injection group, except for emotional roles at baseline, physical roles and bodily pain at one month, and physical functioning at three months.

When examined by success at three months, the clinical and demographic characteristics of study participants were similar. Despite the lack of statistical significance, unsuccessful treatment at three months was more common among men, obese individuals, patients with a shorter duration of pain, and those with greater disability on the Oswestry disability index.

Outcomes were examined by injection method, the number of injections (data not shown), and whether the injection was intra-bursal or extra-bursal. For the primary outcome measure, the numerical rating scale score at one month, the mean hip pain score at rest declined from 5.1 to 2.7 (P = 0.0001) in the fluoroscopically guided injection group and from 4.6 to 2.2 (P = 0.0001) in the blind injection group.

### Greater trochanteric pain syndrome: Epidemiology and associated factors [^111tXpwN]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

To describe the prevalence of greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), its association with iliotibial band (ITB) tenderness, knee osteoarthritis (OA), body mass index (BMI), or low back pain (LBP), and its impact on hip internal rotation, physical activity, and mobility, a cross-sectional, population-based study was conducted. This multicenter observational study involved community-dwelling adults (N = 3026) aged 50 to 79 years.

Greater trochanteric tenderness to palpation in subjects complaining of hip pain, without signs of hip OA or generalized myofascial tenderness, was the main outcome measure. The prevalence of unilateral and bilateral GTPS was 15.0% and 8.5% in women, and 6.6% and 1.9% in men. The odds ratio (OR) for women was 3.37 (95% confidence interval, 2.67–4.25), while age and race were not significantly associated with GTPS.

In a multivariate model adjusting for age, sex, ITB tenderness, ipsilateral and contralateral knee OA, BMI, and LBP, ITB tenderness (OR = 1.72; 95% CI, 1.34–2.19), knee OA ipsilaterally (OR = 3.47; 95% CI, 2.72–4.42) and contralaterally (OR = 1.74; 95% CI, 1.32–2.28), and LBP (OR = 2.79; 95% CI, 2.22–3.50) were positively related to GTPS. However, BMI was not associated with GTPS (OR = 1.10; 95% CI, 0.80–1.52 when comparing ≥ 30 with < 25kg/m²). The hip internal rotation range of motion did not differ based on GTPS status. After multivariate adjustment, GTPS did not alter the physical activity score, but bilateral GTPS was significantly associated with modifications in mobility.

### Focused shockwave treatment for greater trochanteric pain syndrome: A multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial [^115tKR9H]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2020). High credibility.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is a condition of lateral hip pain. Its physiopathology remains unknown, and there is no consensus on optimal management. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of electromagnetic-focused extracorporeal shockwave treatment (F-ESWT) in patients with GTPS.

- **Methods**: This multicenter clinical trial included 103 patients with chronic GTPS randomly assigned to the treatment group, consisting of electromagnetic F-ESWT and a specific exercise protocol, or the control group, receiving sham F-ESWT and the same exercise protocol. Both groups were treated with 3 weekly sessions; the F-ESWT group received an energy flux density of 0.20 mJ/mm, whereas the control group received 0.01 mJ/mm. Patients were assessed at baseline and 1, 2, 3, and 6 months after treatment. A visual analogue scale (VAS) score for pain at 2 months was the primary outcome. The Harris hip score (HHS), Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS), EuroQoL-5 Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D), and Roles and Maudsley score were used as secondary outcomes. Complications were recorded.

- **Results**: The mean VAS score decreased from 6.3 at baseline in both groups to 2.0 in the F-ESWT group versus 4.7 in the control group at 2 months; the 2-month score differed significantly between groups (p < 0.001). All secondary outcomes at all follow-up intervals were significantly better in the F-ESWT group, except for the LEFS score at 1 month after treatment (p = 0.25). No complications were observed.

- **Conclusions**: F-ESWT in association with a specific exercise program is an effective treatment for GTPS.

### Efficacy of platelet-rich plasma versus placebo for the treatment of greater trochanteric pain syndrome: A double-blinded randomized controlled trial [^114jJmqM]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2025). High credibility.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is a painful condition that can impair a patient's quality of life. If nonoperative measures fail, progressively more invasive treatment options may be required. This clinical trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided leukocyte-rich platelet-rich plasma (LR-PRP) injections in the treatment of refractory GTPS caused by bursitis and/or gluteal tendinopathy.

- **Methods**: An ethically approved, adequately powered, double-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted to evaluate the clinical outcomes in randomized LR-PRP and placebo groups using the International Hip Outcome Tool-12 (iHOT-12), a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, the modified Harris hip score (mHHS), the EuroQol 5-Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire, and the presence or absence of complications. All injections were performed under ultrasound guidance into the trochanteric bursa and gluteus medius tendon.

- **Results**: The final analysis included 79 patients (39 in the LR-PRP and 40 in the placebo group; 73 female and 6 male; all Caucasian). Both the LR-PRP and the placebo group generally had improvement from baseline that was maintained to 12 months. The only deterioration in scores compared to baseline was seen in the LR-PRP group for the iHOT-12 at 12 months, the EQ-5D index at 3 and 6 months, and the EQ-5D VAS at all follow-up time points. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups at any follow-up point (p > 0.05). A multivariable linear regression model, with adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, and pre

### Editorial commentary: It is imperative to fix symptomatic hip gluteus medius tears at time of femoroacetabular impingement: Why ignore this pain in the butt [^111vuBGV]. Arthroscopy (2022). Low credibility.

The hip can have a multitude of different pathologies leading to various symptoms. Greater trochanteric pain syndrome, historically attributed to bursitis, has been largely found to be associated with lesions of the gluteus medius and minimus tendons. The prevalence of gluteus medius pathology in patients with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is as high as one-third of the FAI population. If a patient exhibits significant clinical symptoms of both FAI and a gluteus medius tear, it is imperative to address both pathologies.

The most vital diagnostic predictor in hip arthroscopy is not magnetic resonance imaging, but rather a well-executed history and physical examination. We employ a quadrant approach:

- **Medial quadrant**: Accounts for adductor bursitis, adductor tears, pudendal neuralgia, or sports hernias.
- **Posterior quadrant**: May account for a hamstring tear, lumbar radiculopathy, ischiofemoral impingement, or in rare cases, piriformis syndrome.
- **Anterior quadrant**: Accounts for more intra-articular pathologies, including FAI, labral tears, osteoarthritis, avascular necrosis, or iliopsoas bursitis.
- **Lateral quadrant**: Includes greater trochanteric pain syndrome, gluteus medius and minimus tears, external snapping hip syndrome, and iliotibial band syndrome.

By adopting this systematic approach and utilizing magnetic resonance imaging to confirm the diagnosis, we can accurately determine patients' hip pathologies.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. Part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^1166oqRx]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Because GTPS is a clinical syndrome, the diagnosis can be confirmed with physical examination. An efficient method to perform several exam maneuvers to assess for GTPS and other common lumbopelvic and hip conditions involves palpating the proximal lateral thigh of the limb being tested while the patient stands on both feet and pivots the leg being tested into hip internal and external rotation. The bony protuberance most prominent to the examiner's touch is the GT. Focal tenderness over this bony protuberance defines GTPS.

Another common finding in GTPS is a positive Trendelenburg sign. Hip abductor weakness is often the leading biomechanical cause of GTPS. A positive Trendelenburg can be determined by asking the patient to stand on one leg. If the pelvis contralateral to the stance leg drops, there is weakness of the stance leg hip abductor muscles, indicating a positive Trendelenburg sign. If the patient intentionally shifts their trunk over the stance leg, thereby elevating the contralateral pelvis to perform the task, this is considered a positive compensated Trendelenburg sign. This finding also corroborates hip abductor weakness of the stance leg. The presence of a Trendelenburg or compensated Trendelenburg sign can help a provider identify biomechanical issues to direct treatment appropriately. However, a Trendelenburg's sign is positive in 54% of all people with CLBP.

### The effectiveness of extracorporeal shockwave therapy in common lower limb conditions: A systematic review including quantification of patient-rated pain reduction [^113BsuFG]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

To evaluate extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) in treating Achilles tendinopathy (AT), greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS), patellar tendinopathy (PT), and proximal hamstring tendinopathy (PHT), a systematic review was conducted. The review included randomized and non-randomized studies assessing ESWT in patients with AT, GTPS, MTSS, PT, and PHT. Risk of bias and quality of studies were evaluated.

- **Results**:
	- **Moderate-level evidence suggests**:
		1. No difference between focused ESWT and placebo ESWT at short and mid-term in PT.
		2. Radial ESWT is superior to conservative treatment at short, mid, and long term in PHT.
	- **Low-level evidence suggests that ESWT**:
		1. Is comparable to eccentric training, but superior to a wait-and-see policy at 4 months in mid-portion AT.
		2. Is superior to eccentric training at 4 months in insertional AT.
		3. Is less effective than corticosteroid injection at short term, but ESWT produced superior results at mid and long term in GTPS.
		4. Produced comparable results to control treatment at long term in GTPS.
		5. Is superior to control conservative treatment at long term in PT.
	- Regarding the rest of the results, there was only very low or no level of evidence. Thirteen studies showed high risk of bias largely due to methodology, blinding, and reporting.

- **Conclusion**: Low level of evidence suggests that ESWT may be effective for some lower limb conditions in all phases of rehabilitation.

### Ultrasound imaging of the posterior lateral corner of the knee: A pictorial review of anatomy and pathologies [^112kWAdx]. Insights into Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

Posterior lateral knee pain poses a diagnostic challenge where the clinical decision heavily relies on the patient's symptoms and physical examination. Various specific tests, such as the varus stress test for the integrity of the lateral collateral ligament or the Noble compression test for iliotibial band friction syndrome, are used in this context. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the knee offers comprehensive insights into the structures within the posterolateral corner, facilitating the assessment of potential injuries. Variability in certain components of the posterolateral corner is observable on MR imaging with anatomic correlation. However, concerns regarding cost and portability pose significant considerations when utilizing MR imaging for screening posterior lateral corner injuries.

On the other hand, ultrasound imaging has revolutionized the diagnosis of musculoskeletal disorders, including the painful knee, due to its zero radiation exposure and superior resolution. However, the scanning protocol (EURO-MUSCULUS/USPRM: Basic scanning protocols for the knee) does not thoroughly investigate the complex fascia, tendon, and ligamentous systems at the posterior lateral knee. Moreover, important but infrequent conditions, such as popliteus myotendinous junction strain, can be missed. Most existing articles present normal sonoanatomy without demonstrating the usefulness of ultrasound examination in delineating the relevant pathologies. In this pictorial essay, aiming to optimize prompt management, we revisit the anatomy of the posterior lateral corner of the knee.

### Athletic groin pain (part 1): a prospective anatomical diagnosis of 382 patients — clinical findings, MRI findings and patient-reported outcome measures at baseline [^114Qaf1h]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

A clinical diagnosis was the product of directed history, clinical examination, and MRI findings. This process is outlined in previous work by Falvey et al.

Tenderness (i.e. pain with palpation) of the rectus abdominis insertion to the superomedial aspect of the pubic bone (figure 2). Pain (at the pubic insertion of rectus abdominis) on squeeze test, positive crossover test, and pain on resisted lower abdominal muscle contraction. MRI scan findings of high signal of, microtearing of, or separation of the PA from the pubic bone (figure 3).

Tenderness at the adductor origin from the inferior aspect of the pubic bone (figure 2). Pain (at the adductor origin) on squeeze test and pain noted on passive abduction of the hip. MRI scan findings of high signal at, microtearing of, or separation of the adductor from the pubic bone.

- **Hip injury**: History of pain within or lateral to the groin triangle (figure 1). Limited internal rotation of the hip (< 30° with hip flexed to 90°), pain on FABER and/or FADIR. MRI scan findings consistent with hip pathology — femoroacetabular impingement (FAI), osteochondral/chondrolabral pathology.

### Comparison of fluoroscopically guided and blind corticosteroid injections for greater trochanteric pain syndrome: Multicentre randomised controlled trial [^115PWvv2]. BMJ (2009). High credibility.

An examination of the relative strengths and weaknesses of this study is needed to put the results in context. Firstly, this is the only controlled study that has evaluated trochanteric bursa injections. The absence of controlled studies is somewhat surprising, considering that a recent audit found that the number of procedures billed to Medicare, the largest health insurance supplier in the United States, under the procedural terminology code pertaining to "major joint or bursa injection", which includes trochanteric bursa injections, far exceeds that of any other pain management intervention.

Secondly, our outcomes are less positive than several others reported for trochanteric bursa injections. However, all previous studies evaluating trochanteric bursa injections were unblinded and uncontrolled, which tends to accentuate expectation bias. Nevertheless, larger, placebo-controlled studies are needed to better ascertain the efficacy of trochanteric bursa corticosteroid injections.

Another concern about this study stems from the fact that only 39 of the 65 participants had outcome data recorded at three months. This was justified on the basis of ethical concerns stemming from pilot data showing that less than 10% of patients with "negative" outcomes at one month would experience a "positive" outcome three months post-injection with no intervening treatment. However, not carrying over one-month treatment failures limits the long-term conclusions on efficacy and differences between treatment groups that can be reached from these results.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic injection of the hip and knee [^117UDdW2]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Joint injection of the hip and knee regions is a useful diagnostic and therapeutic tool for the family physician. In this article, the injection procedure for the greater trochanteric bursa, the knee joint, the pes anserine bursa, the iliotibial band, and the prepatellar bursa is reviewed. Indications for greater trochanteric bursa injection include acute and chronic inflammation associated with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, repetitive use, and other traumatic injuries to the area. For the knee joint, aspiration may be performed to aid in the diagnosis of an unexplained effusion and relieve discomfort caused by an effusion. Injection of the knee can be performed for viscosupplementation or corticosteroid therapy. Indications for corticosteroid injection include advanced osteoarthritis and other inflammatory arthritides, such as gout or calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease. Swelling and tenderness of pes anserine or prepatellar bursae can be relieved with aspiration and corticosteroid injection. Persistent pain and disability from iliotibial band syndrome respond to local injection therapy. The proper technique, choice and quantity of pharmaceuticals, and appropriate follow-up are essential for effective outcomes.

### Pain expansion and severity reflect central sensitization in primary care patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome [^116Qnaot]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The aims of this study were twofold: to evaluate the differences in pain sensitivity of patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) and to examine the association between pain expansion, pain severity, and pain-related central sensitization somatosensory variables in patients with GTPS.

A cross-sectional study was conducted in primary health care centers. The sample consisted of 49 participants with a mean age of 48.28 ± 8.13 years, including eight males (16.3%) and 41 females (83.7%).

Conditioned pain modulation (CPM), pain location, temporal summation, pressure pain detection threshold (PPDT), and pain intensity were recorded. Pain severity was determined with the Graded Chronic Pain Scale (GCPS).

Several participants (34.7%) exhibited a negative conditioned pain modulation and a statistically significant negative moderate correlation (P < 0.05; r = -0.316) between conditioned pain modulation and the right view percentage of pain location. Temporal summation at the major trochanter showed a statistically significant low negative correlation (P < 0.05; r = -0.298). The GCPS exhibited a statistically significant moderately positive correlation (P < 0.01; r = 0.467) with the PPDT at the trochanter and a significant correlation with the postero-superior iliac spine (P < 0.01; r = 0.515) and epicondyle (P < 0.01; r = 0.566).

Patients with GTPS presented altered CPM and a relationship with more pain areas associated with negative CPM. Additionally, there was a positive association between pain severity and mechanical hyperalgesia at remote sites.

### Gluteal loading versus sham exercises to improve pain and dysfunction in postmenopausal women with greater trochanteric pain syndrome: A randomized controlled trial [^111zKeXs]. Journal of Women's Health (2018). High credibility.

The aim of the study was to determine the effects of education with targeted or sham exercise on pain and function in postmenopausal women with greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS).

Conservative management of GTPS is poorly described, and at the time of writing, there have been no studies on education with exercise as an intervention for GTPS. Ninety-four postmenopausal women with GTPS were recruited to participate in this study.

Participants were randomized to receive one of two 12-week exercise programs (GLoBE vs. sham). Participants received education on avoiding tendon compression with appropriate activity modification. The Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Gluteal tendon (VISA-G) was examined at baseline, 12, and 52 weeks. Secondary outcomes included hip pain and function questionnaires: Hip Dysfunction and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS), Oxford Hip Score (OHS), and Lateral Hip Pain questionnaire. Additional measures were a global rating of change in symptom questionnaire and a quality of life measure (Assessment of Quality of Life [AQoL]-8D). Differences between groups were analyzed using intention-to-treat with analysis of covariance, per-protocol analysis, and responder analysis.

Responders to the GLoBE intervention had significantly better VISA-G, HOOS, OHS, and lateral hip pain questionnaire scores compared to responders in the sham group. However, intention-to-treat analyses showed no between-group differences for the GLoBE intervention and sham exercise groups. Significant improvement in VISA-G score was found for both.

### Pertrochanteric calcifications in patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome: Description, prevalence, and correlation with intraoperatively diagnosed hip abductor tendon injuries [^112eErwb]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Pertrochanteric calcifications can be found in patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS). A systematic description of the types and prevalence of these calcifications has not been undertaken, and there is conflicting evidence regarding their association with abductor tendon injuries.

- **Purpose**:
	- (1) To describe the various types and prevalence of pertrochanteric calcifications in patients presenting for the surgical management of recalcitrant GTPS.
	- (2) To evaluate the association of the various calcifications with intraoperatively diagnosed hip abductor tendon injuries, including tendinosis, partial-thickness tears, and full-thickness tears.

- **Study design**: Cross-sectional study; level of evidence 3.

- **Methods**: Patients undergoing surgical management for GTPS, either in isolation or as an ancillary procedure during hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement, between April 2008 and February 2020 were included. Of these, 85 procedures were isolated treatments of GTPS, and the remaining 628 were ancillary to hip arthroscopy. Radiographs were scrutinized for the presence of pertrochanteric calcifications. The hip abductor tendon status was intraoperatively classified as intact, partial-thickness tear, or full-thickness tear. The prevalence and correlation of the various radiographic findings in relation to the intraoperatively classified tendon condition were analyzed via the odds ratio (OR).

- **Results**: Surgery was performed on 713 hips with recalcitrant GTPS. No tear was found in 340 hips (47.7%), and 289 hips (40.5%) had a partial-thickness tear.

Summary of the methodologic qualities of the studies included:

The results of the methodologic quality assessment of the included studies are detailed in Supplementary Table 2, available on the Arthritis Care & Research website. The mean score was 48% for cohort studies, 41% for cross-sectional studies, and 50% for case-control studies. A total of 31 studies were high quality, while 25 were low quality. Six studies did not explain the statistical test used. Nine studies did not define pathology. The GRADE quality of evidence for the relationship for all imaging features/symptoms outcomes was very low due to study limitations, quality, inconsistency, and indirectness.

### Treatment of recalcitrant iliotibial band friction syndrome with open iliotibial band bursectomy: Indications, technique, and clinical outcomes [^116VjxvJ]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Iliotibial band friction syndrome (ITBFS) is an overuse injury causing lateral knee pain. There is evidence that the pathological lesion is, in fact, an inflamed bursa underlying the iliotibial band (ITB) rather than an inflamed ITB itself. The hypothesis is that resection of the bursa underlying the ITB in ITBFS patients will relieve their pain and allow them to return to their pre-injury activity level.

- **Study design**: Case series; Level of evidence, 4.
- **Methods**: We describe the technique of ITB bursectomy and report a minimal 20-month follow-up of patients who had ITB bursectomies performed by a single surgeon. The patients completed a survey detailing their preoperative and postoperative symptoms and activities.
- **Results**: The senior author performed 12 consecutive cases of ITB bursectomies (12 patients). One was excluded from the study due to previous microfracture. The average age at surgery was 32 years (standard deviation, 5; range, 24–41), with 7 men and 4 women participating. Postoperatively, patients were able to return to their pre-injury Tegner activity levels, and the visual analog pain scores decreased by an average of 6 points (P < .001). Six patients were completely satisfied with the surgical outcome, 3 were mostly satisfied, 2 were somewhat satisfied, and none were dissatisfied. Nine of 11 patients indicated they would undergo the surgery again knowing what they know now.
- **Conclusion**: Iliotibial band bursectomy successfully reduces knee pain in patients with ITBFS and allows them to return to their pre-injury level of activity. The great majority of patients expressed satisfaction with the procedure.

### Soft-tissue sources of extra-articular pain following total hip arthroplasty: A comprehensive review [^116XLWPL]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Trochanteric bursitis, or inflammation of one or more of the peri-trochanteric bursae, has historically been considered a primary source of lateral hip pain, with an approximate prevalence of 4.4% to 29% in patients post-THA. A proposed cause is repetitive friction between the greater trochanter (GT) and the iliotibial band, commonly associated with overuse, trauma, and altered gait patterns.

Teng et al. investigated the effect of performing a bursectomy during primary THA. In this study, 550 patients underwent routine bursectomy, while 400 did not. At an 11-year follow-up, the incidence of trochanteric bursitis was unaffected by whether a bursectomy was performed. Furthermore, White et al. recently conducted a risk factor analysis for the development of trochanteric bursitis, evaluating 1,094 patients, of whom 103 (9.4%) developed trochanteric bursitis. The incidence varied slightly by surgical approach: 8.7% for the posterior approach, 10.8% for the direct anterior approach, and 4.2% for the direct lateral approach. However, the surgical approach was not identified as a notable risk factor. Among the variables analyzed, only sex was markedly associated with increased risk; women had a 1.79 times higher risk of developing trochanteric bursitis. Notably, changes in acetabular offset, femoral offset, total offset, and leg length between preoperative and postoperative radiographs were not associated with an increased risk of trochanteric bursitis in either univariate or multivariate model.

Patients usually complain of lateral thigh pain, often aggravated by prolonged sitting or stair climbing, with a tender area on the GT.

### Editorial commentary: An optimal classification system to guide prognosis and treatment in greater trochanteric pain syndrome: Now we're speaking the same language [^1159z36o]. Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

The optimal classification system in arthroscopic and related surgery research and clinical practice should be clinically relevant, descriptive, reproducible, simple, inexpensive, safe, and widely applicable. For the hip, classification systems characterizing intra-articular disorders like femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome, dysplasia, labral tears, and articular cartilage disease predominate the literature. Recently, awareness of peritrochanteric and other extra-articular disorders has led to greater recognition, diagnosis, and treatment of what has been historically known as "just bursitis". These disorders are far more complex and include greater trochanteric pain syndrome, the spectrum of gluteal tendon pathology, greater trochanteric bursitis, snapping iliotibial band (external coxa saltans), and greater trochanteric-ischial impingement.

The utility of an intraoperative greater trochanteric pain syndrome classification system has now been proven using prospectively collected data. This system assimilates a decade-long eligibility period following open or endoscopic treatment of peritrochanteric disorders with a minimum two-year follow-up using validated patient-reported outcome scores. This classification guides prognosis and treatment, exactly as an optimal orthopedic classification system should.

### Greater trochanteric pain syndrome negatively affects work, physical activity and quality of life: a case control study [^113CoYNK]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2014). Low credibility.

Musculoskeletal injury causes pain, and when chronic, it can affect mental health, employment, and quality of life. This study examined work participation, function, and quality of life in people with greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS, n = 42), severe hip osteoarthritis (OA, n = 20), and an asymptomatic group (ASC, n = 23). No differences were found between the symptomatic groups on key measures, with both being more affected than the ASC group; they had lower quality of life scores (p < 0.001), Harris Hip Score (p < 0.001), and higher Oswestry Disability Index (p < 0.001). Participants with GTPS were the least likely to be in full-time work (probability: GTPS = 0.29, OA = 0.52, and ASC = 0.68). GTPS appears to confer levels of disability and quality of life similar to those associated with end-stage hip OA.

### Arthroscopic bursectomy with concomitant iliotibial band release for the treatment of recalcitrant trochanteric bursitis [^115A99B4]. Arthroscopy (2007). Low credibility.

Trochanteric bursitis with lateral hip pain is a commonly encountered orthopedic condition. Although most patients respond to corticosteroid injections, rest, physical therapy (PT), stretching, and anti-inflammatory medications, those with recalcitrant symptoms may require operative intervention. Studies have explored the use of the arthroscope in the treatment of these patients; however, these reports have not addressed the underlying pathology in this chronic condition.

We believe that the iliotibial band must be addressed as it is the main cause of pain, inflammation, and trochanteric impingement, leading to the development of bursitis. We report a new technique for arthroscopic trochanteric bursectomy with iliotibial band release. Our technique involves two incisions — one 4 cm proximal to the greater trochanter along the anterior border of the iliotibial band, and the other 4 cm distal along the posterior border.

The 30-degree arthroscope is introduced through the inferior portal, and a cannula is introduced through the superior portal. A 5.5-mm arthroscopic shaver is inserted through the superior cannula to clear the surface of the iliotibial band so that it may be adequately visualized. A hooked electrocautery probe is then used to longitudinally incise the iliotibial band until it no longer rubs, causing impingement over the greater trochanter.

### Editorial commentary: Gluteal pain syndrome of the hip: It's been there all along [^115z9Jws]. Arthroscopy (2017). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and management of deep gluteal syndrome of the hip are currently evolving, and the lack of prospective studies makes discerning the appropriate treatment even more difficult. Communication between physicians managing this issue needs to improve to better coordinate care and limit the number of unnecessary studies that these patients typically undergo.

### Focused extracorporeal shock wave therapy for greater trochanteric pain syndrome with gluteal tendinopathy: a randomized controlled trial [^114DxauK]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2019). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether focused extracorporeal shock wave therapy (f-ESWT) is an effective treatment for individuals affected by greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS). This randomized controlled trial, with blind outcome assessors, was conducted in an outpatient setting at a university hospital. The study included 50 patients suffering from GTPS with gluteal tendinopathy.

- **Interventions**: The study group was assigned to receive f-ESWT, while the control group received ultrasound therapy (UST).

- **Main measures**: We assessed hip pain and lower limb function using a numeric rating scale (p-NRS) and the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS scale), respectively. The first follow-up evaluation (2M-FUP) took place two months after the initial treatment session. The second follow-up (6M-FUP) was conducted six months later.

- **Results**: The mean age of the population was 61.24 years (standard deviation 9.26 years), with a marked prevalence of female participants (44 subjects, 86%). Statistical analysis revealed a significant reduction in pain over time for both groups, with f-ESWT proving to be significantly more effective than UST (P < 0.05) at the 2M-FUP (pain levels of 2.08 vs. 3.36) and at the 6M-FUP (pain levels of 0.79 vs. 2.03). Both groups exhibited considerable improvement in the LEFS total score, though no statistical differences were detected between the groups in these comparisons.

Our findings support the hypothesis that f-ESWT is effective in reducing pain, both in short-term and mid-term perspectives. We also observed functional improvement in the affected lower limb; however, in this case, f-ESWT did not demonstrate significantly greater effectiveness compared to UST.

### Hip joint pathology as a leading cause of groin pain in the sporting population: A 6-year review of 894 cases [^111vTqGp]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic hip and groin pain presents a diagnostic challenge for the sports medicine practitioner. Recent consensus suggests diagnostic categorization based on five clinical entities: hip joint, adductor, pubic bone stress injury, iliopsoas, or abdominal wall-related pathology. However, the prevalence patterns and coexistence of these pathologies in an active population remain unclear.

- **Purpose**: This study presents a descriptive epidemiology based on a large sample of active individuals with long-standing pain in the hip and groin region. The objectives were to examine the prevalence of key clinical entities, document coexisting pathologies, and present prevalence patterns based on key demographics.

- **Study design**: The study is a cross-sectional study with a level of evidence rated at 3.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review was conducted of clinical records of all hip and groin injuries seen between January 2006 and December 2011, under the care of a single experienced sports medicine consultant. In all cases, imaging was performed by a team of specialist musculoskeletal radiologists. Diagnoses were categorized according to the five clinical entities using contemporary diagnostic nomenclature. The chi-square test was employed to compare observed and expected frequencies across the prevalence figures of each subgroup, based on sex, age, and sports participation.

- **Results**: Full medical records were retrieved from 894 patients with chronic hip and groin pain. The majority of patients were male (73%), aged between 26 and 30 years, and engaged in footballing codes (soccer, rugby, and Gaelic sports) or running. A total of 24 combinations of diagnoses were documented.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^117Pohtr]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Although the diagnosis is clinical and imaging is rarely required, plain radiographs may be useful to evaluate other conditions such as hip osteoarthritis. Ultrasound can be used to identify inflammation of the bursae around the greater trochanter if the diagnosis is in doubt. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be employed to confirm the diagnosis in uncertain cases or to aid surgical planning in cases refractory to non-surgical management. Physiotherapy is a mainstay of treatment and should focus on individualized rehabilitation of contributing factors, such as hip abductor weakness. A peri-trochanteric corticosteroid injection can be highly efficacious for treating pain from greater trochanteric pain syndrome, suggesting that a lack of response should lead the clinician to strongly consider alternative diagnoses.

- **Iliotibial band syndrome**: Iliotibial (IT) band syndrome is characterized by lateral knee pain in individuals who engage in physically strenuous activity, such as running or cycling. A leading pathoanatomic explanation is that the IT band rubs over the lateral femoral condyle during repetitive knee flexion and extension. The IT band is a complex fibrous structure that arises out of the fascia of the tensor fascia lata muscle at the lateral hip, extends down the lateral thigh, and inserts at Gerdy's tubercle on the lateral tibia. Together with the tensor fascia lata muscle, the IT band's primary function is to stabilize the hip and knee in the stance phase and assist in hip extension, abduction, and external rotation. At the knee, the IT band also provides lateral stability and resists torsional movements.

### Beyond the greater trochanter: A pictorial review of the pelvic bursae [^112VJfaV]. Clinical Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Reviewing the MRI appearance of various bursae throughout the pelvis, including pertinent osseous and musculotendinous anatomy, is crucial. Bursae are potential spaces that reduce friction between opposing moving components, which can become inflamed, clinically mimicking internal derangement.

- **Results**: This series illustrates both the most common and lesser-known pelvic bursae. Common causes of bursitis, including overuse, trauma, and infection, are presented.

- **Conclusion**: Multiple bursae are located throughout the pelvis. It is important for radiologists to recognize bursitis as a potential etiology of pain and be familiar with their anatomical locations to guide appropriate management.

### Greater trochanteric pain syndrome: A review of anatomy, diagnosis and treatment [^116pY7t9]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2009). Low credibility.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is a term used to describe chronic pain overlying the lateral aspect of the hip. This regional pain syndrome, once described as trochanteric bursitis, often mimics pain generated from other sources, including, but not limited to, myofascial pain, degenerative joint disease, and spinal pathology. The incidence of greater trochanteric pain is reported to be approximately 1.8 patients per 1000 per year, with the prevalence being higher in women, and patients with coexisting low back pain, osteoarthritis, iliotibial band tenderness, and obesity.

Symptoms of GTPS consist of persistent pain in the lateral hip radiating along the lateral aspect of the thigh to the knee and occasionally below the knee and/or buttock. Physical examination reveals point tenderness in the posterolateral area of the greater trochanter. Most cases of GTPS are self-limited, with conservative measures such as physical therapy, weight loss, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and behavior modification providing resolution of symptoms. Other treatment modalities include bursa or lateral hip injections performed with corticosteroid and local anesthetic. More invasive surgical interventions have anecdotally been reported to provide pain relief when conservative treatment modalities fail.

### Iliotibial-band and gluteus medius percutaneous ultrasound tenotomy for refractory trochanteric pain syndrome: A longitudinal observational study with one-year durability results [^112tkwMb]. Pain Physician (2024). Low credibility.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is a common cause of lateral hip pain that affects patients' quality of life and functioning. The condition is often associated with tightness of the iliotibial band (ITB) and tendinopathy of the gluteus medius (GMed) tendon, which are subjected to excessive stress and inflammation. A traditional treatment for GTPS is conservative medical management (CMM), which includes, but is not limited to, physiotherapy, oral anti-inflammatory medication, and/or local steroid injections. Surgery is performed when these treatments fail. The failure of these techniques indicates that some treatments classified as CMM may not be feasible for some patients.

- **Objectives**: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combined GMed and ITB injections for a cohort of CMM-refractory GTPS patients.

- **Study design**: A retrospective chart review.

- **Setting**: Single-center, academic hospital.

- **Methods**: Between 01/01/2022 and 12/31/2022, a retrospective analysis of 68 hips that underwent combination GMed-ITB percutaneous ultrasound tenotomy (PUT) was performed. The primary outcome measure was a numeric rating scale (NRS) for hip pain, and the secondary outcome measures were VISA-G (Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Gluteal Tendinopathy) scores, sitting-to-standing and walking tolerance, and side-lying tolerance.

- **Results**: The patients' NRS scores decreased, and the VISA-G scores and all functional measures increased one year after the procedure, indicating significant improvement in pain and functioning (P < 0.001).

### Local corticosteroid injection in iliotibial band friction syndrome in runners: a randomised controlled trial [^112DHt6M]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2004). High credibility.

To establish whether a local injection of methylprednisolone acetate (40 mg) is effective in decreasing pain during running in runners with recent onset (less than two weeks) iliotibial band friction syndrome (ITBFS), eighteen runners with at least grade 2 ITBFS underwent baseline investigations. These included a treadmill running test where pain was recorded on a visual analogue scale every minute. The runners were randomly assigned to either the experimental group (EXP; nine participants) or a placebo control group (CON; nine participants). The EXP group received an injection in the area where the iliotibial band crosses the lateral femoral condyle with 40 mg of methylprednisolone acetate mixed with a short-acting local anaesthetic, while the CON group received only the short-acting local anaesthetic. The same laboratory-based running test was repeated after seven and 14 days. The main outcome measure was total pain during running, calculated as the area under the pain versus time graph for each running test.

There was a tendency (p = 0.07) for a greater decrease in total pain (mean (SEM)) during treadmill running in the EXP group compared to the CON group from day 0 (EXP = 222 (71), CON = 197 (31)) to day 7 (EXP = 140 (87), CON = 178 (76)). However, there was a significant decrease in total pain during running (p = 0.01) from day 7 (EXP = 140 (87), CON = 178 (76)) to day 14 (EXP = 103 (89), CON = 157 (109)) in the EXP group compared with the CON group.

In conclusion, local corticosteroid infiltration effectively decreases pain during running in the first two weeks of treatment in patients with ITBFS.

### Comparison of fluoroscopically guided and blind corticosteroid injections for greater trochanteric pain syndrome: Multicentre randomised controlled trial [^113g11u7]. BMJ (2009). High credibility.

Rapid advancements in elucidating the mechanisms of disease, preventive and diagnostic capabilities, and therapeutic interventions have not necessarily been reflected in better treatment outcomes. Nowhere is this incongruity more evident than in the management of pain. Although the field of pain management has seen a dramatic surge in recognition, research interest, resource allocation, and treatment options, the rates of pain-related disability continue to soar. This disparity has led some experts to question the relations between scientific advancements, expenditures, and the quality of health care.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome, also known as trochanteric bursitis, is a common medical condition with a lifetime prevalence exceeding 20%. It occurs more frequently in women, older people, and people with low back pain. Corticosteroid injections can provide considerable relief in most patients who fail to respond to conservative treatment. One epidemiological study in a primary care setting found that patients who received a corticosteroid injection had a 2.7-fold greater chance of long-term recovery compared with patients who had not had an injection.

Despite the prevalence of greater trochanteric pain syndrome, only a few studies evaluating the efficacy of corticosteroid injections have been published, none of which was controlled or used fluoroscopy or other imaging techniques such as ultrasonography. The average success rate in these studies ranged between 50% and 70%, with follow-up ranging between two weeks and two years.

### Pathogenesis and contemporary diagnoses for lateral hip pain: A scoping review [^11371pq2]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

Ultrasound examination is often useful to aid diagnosis when snapping is not elicitable in the clinic, as it helps visualize the tensor fascia lata (TFL) gliding over the greater trochanter (GT). This technique, however, relies heavily on the skill of the operator to identify the pathology. Several authors have reported that dynamic ultrasound is beneficial in making a definitive diagnosis, confirming an audible or palpable snap, or pain reported by the patient during provocative maneuvers of the hip. An MRI scan can be useful in cases where one cannot confirm external snapping hip syndrome (ESHS) clinically. Features on a T2 sequence, such as thickening and hyperintensity of the proximal iliotibial tract or hypertrophy of the gluteus maximus tendon insertion to the TFL, suggest ESHS. Additionally, a hyperintense greater trochanteric bursa or a fluid collection observed on T2 may also indicate ESHS.

In an MRI-based study evaluating 55 patients with ESHS, the condition was classified as grade I in 25.5% of cases, grade II in 40%, and grade III in 34.6%. The study also found differences in ESHS pathology depending on the location of the abnormality, with the iliotibial band (ITB) being tensed and the gluteus maximus being hypertrophied. Overall, a dynamic ultrasound performed by an experienced operator, along with an MRI scan, is useful for confirming the diagnosis and aiding in the management plan for ESHS.

### Iliotibial band Z-lengthening [^114Yfgbg]. Arthroscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Iliotibial band friction syndrome (ITBFS) is a common overuse injury reported to afflict 1.6% to 12% of runners. It results from an inflammatory response secondary to excessive friction that occurs between the lateral femoral epicondyle and the iliotibial band. Initial treatments include rest, anti-inflammatory medication, modalities (ice or heat), stretching, physical therapy, and possibly a cortisone injection. In recalcitrant cases of ITBFS, surgery has been advocated. This report describes a surgical technique of Z-lengthening of the iliotibial band in patients presenting with lateral knee pain localized to the iliotibial band at the lateral femoral epicondyle and Gerdy's tubercle who failed all nonoperative efforts.

### Comparison of fluoroscopically guided and blind corticosteroid injections for greater trochanteric pain syndrome: Multicentre randomised controlled trial [^115SysNX]. BMJ (2009). High credibility.

A physician, unaware of the patient's study group assignment, obtained all outcome data during scheduled follow-up visits. Between the procedure and first follow-up, we permitted no contact between any patient and investigator. All patients were seen in the treating clinic one month after the procedure.

If a patient had a positive global perceived effect and significant (≥ 50%) pain relief, obviating the need for further treatment, he or she was re-evaluated three months post-treatment. Patients who did not have adequate pain relief one month after the procedure were unblinded and left the study to receive alternative medical care. The rationale for this decision was based on pilot data showing that only 7% of patients who failed to experience relief one month following a trochanteric bursa injection had a positive outcome 8–12 weeks post-procedure with no intervening treatment. Patients who continued to receive satisfactory pain relief were unblinded after their final three-month follow-up.

The two main questions we sought to answer were whether fluoroscopically guided trochanteric bursa injections were superior to "blinded" injections and whether intra-bursal injections were better than extra-bursal injections.

The primary outcome measures were pain scores on a 0–10 numerical rating scale at rest and with activity one month post-injection, reflecting the average pain the patient experienced over the preceding week. Secondary outcome measures were the SF-36, Oswestry disability index, and reduction in drug use (predefined as a 20% reduction in opiate use).

### Management of greater trochanteric pain syndrome after total hip arthroplasty: Practice patterns and surgeon attitudes [^115wpFdJ]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), or trochanteric bursitis, is described as pain on the lateral side of the hip that does not involve the hip joint and can be elicited clinically by palpation over the greater trochanter. At the time of writing, there remains no consensus on clinical guidelines for either diagnosis or management of GTPS.

- **Methods**: To understand the practice patterns, beliefs, and attitudes relating to the management of GTPS after total hip arthroplasty, a survey was developed and completed by Canadian arthroplasty surgeons. The final survey consisted of 23 questions divided into three sections: 1) screening questions; 2) demographic information; and 3) practice patterns, attitudes, and beliefs.

- **Results**: Most surgeons use physical examination alone for diagnosis. A detailed analysis indicates that surgeons primarily treat GTPS with oral anti-inflammatories (57.1%), structured physiotherapy (52.4%), and steroid injections (45.2%). Management options are typically nonsurgical and comprise a combination of either unstructured or targeted physiotherapy, corticosteroid injections, or platelet-rich plasma.

- **Discussion**: There remains an absence of clinical consensus for the diagnosis and management of GTPS after total hip arthroplasty. Physical examination is most often relied on regardless of the availability of imaging aids. While common treatments of GTPS were identified, up to one-third of patients fail initial therapy.
