## Question

Retinal vascular occlusion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about retinal vascular occlusion, preserving the thinking process and self-verification language throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying retinal artery occlusion versus retinal vein occlusion and why that matters. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and risk factors that drive management. Next, I will review clinical presentations and the key differentiators. After that, I need to check the diagnostic workflow and imaging. Then, I will examine acute management, including thrombolysis windows and stroke pathways for CRAO/BRAO, and ocular therapy for RVO. I should confirm secondary prevention and systemic workup, including GCA screening. Finally, I will consider special scenarios, prognosis, and follow-up, and close with a concise synthesis that ties these elements together with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the classification because management hinges on it: retinal artery occlusion (RAO) is an arterial ischemic event and is treated as a stroke equivalent, whereas retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is a venous outflow obstruction that primarily threatens vision via macular edema and neovascular complications, not as a direct cerebrovascular emergency, though it still signals elevated systemic vascular risk [^117FhzjN] [^112N5puG] [^111xHT5d].

> I need to check the pathophysiology next. CRAO is most often due to embolic obstruction of the central retinal artery, with spontaneous visual recovery uncommon and poor final acuity in the majority, which explains the urgency of reperfusion strategies when feasible [^116Z2C6S]. RVO, by contrast, reflects venous thrombosis with downstream VEGF-driven macular edema and ischemia, and its prevalence and burden are substantial worldwide, reinforcing the need for timely anti-VEGF therapy to preserve vision [^111WYZR6] [^111xHT5d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about risk factors without verifying the weight of evidence. For RAO, embolic sources from carotid atherosclerosis and cardioembolic disease predominate, with age, hypertension, smoking, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation as key risks; importantly, RAO carries a markedly elevated short-term stroke risk, approaching 3–6% in the first month and up to roughly 20–25% in some series, which mandates urgent stroke evaluation and secondary prevention [^111Xk8WW] [^1126PkgV]. For RVO, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and glaucoma are major contributors, and RVO itself is a marker of systemic cardiovascular disease burden, supporting aggressive risk factor modification and primary care coordination [^1172KtwH] [^113j1xMj].

> Let me think about clinical presentation to avoid misclassification. CRAO typically presents with sudden, painless, severe monocular vision loss, often counting fingers or worse, with a cherry-red spot and retinal whitening on exam; BRAO shows a corresponding visual field defect and sectoral retinal changes, whereas RVO presents with blurred vision from macular edema, retinal hemorrhages, and cotton-wool spots, with pain uncommon unless complicated by neovascular glaucoma [^117FhzjN] [^1145KTcX] [^111xHT5d].

> I should double-check the diagnostic workflow. Immediate fundus examination confirms the vascular event, but OCT is essential to quantify macular edema and guide anti-VEGF decisions, FA delineates perfusion status and neovascularization risk, and OCTA can noninvasively assess retinal vasculature; for suspected RAO, urgent stroke imaging with brain MRI/DWI and vascular imaging of the carotids and heart are indicated to identify embolic sources and concurrent infarctions, and in patients over 50, I must actively exclude GCA with ESR/CRP and temporal artery biopsy if indicated [^112jeAM6] [^113xthQw] [^113G2E62] [^115s6tYN].

> Now, acute management for RAO: I need to ensure time sensitivity is emphasized. Within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, IV thrombolysis may be considered in appropriate patients at stroke centers, and intra-arterial approaches have been explored up to about 6 hours, though high-quality randomized evidence remains limited and institutional protocols vary; regardless, immediate referral to a stroke center is recommended, and ancillary maneuvers like ocular massage or anterior chamber paracentesis have limited evidence and should not delay stroke care [^112FG7Fk] [^112AHDBQ] [^115vD3Wp]. Wait, let me verify the stroke risk window: yes, the highest risk is in the first days to weeks after RAO, so expedited neurologic and cardiovascular evaluation is critical even if vision does not recover [^111Xk8WW].

> For RVO, I should confirm the first-line therapy. Intravitreal anti-VEGF agents are the evidence-based initial treatment for macular edema in both CRVO and BRVO, with sustained visual gains in randomized trials; corticosteroids are effective but carry higher risks of IOP elevation and cataract, so they are generally reserved for select cases or as adjuncts; PRP remains indicated for retinal or iris neovascularization to reduce the risk of vitreous hemorrhage and neovascular glaucoma, and anti-VEGF can be used acutely to facilitate laser or as bridge therapy [^111xHT5d] [^114W6s5P] [^117Tpzxu]. Hold on, I should verify the long-term burden: many patients require ongoing anti-VEGF beyond 5 years, underscoring the need for durable treatment planning and follow-up [^111JBohf].

> Next, I should review secondary prevention and systemic workup because missing this would be a major pitfall. All RAO patients warrant a stroke-level evaluation including brain MRI, carotid imaging, echocardiography, ECG, and risk factor optimization; antiplatelet therapy is reasonable when no contraindication exists, and atrial fibrillation or other cardioembolic sources should be treated per stroke protocols; for RVO, referral to primary care for hypertension, diabetes, and lipid management is essential, and although lowering these factors may not directly restore vision, it reduces future vascular events and may influence long-term outcomes [^112FG7Fk] [^113G2E62] [^1172KtwH] [^117FhzjN].

> But wait, what if the patient is over 50 and I haven't considered GCA? I need to ensure I do not overlook this treatable cause of CRAO. In patients aged 50 or older with RAO, I should have a low threshold to start high-dose systemic corticosteroids if GCA is suspected while arranging temporal artery biopsy, because rapid immunosuppression can prevent devastating vision loss in the fellow eye and systemic complications; poor choroidal perfusion on FA/ICG can be a clue to arteritic disease [^115s6tYN] [^112AWRWE] [^1164Q7C1].

> I will now examine special scenarios that alter urgency or therapy. Combined CRAO/CRVO can occur in systemic inflammatory or infectious contexts such as acute retinal necrosis and mandates both antiviral therapy and coordinated retinal and systemic care; filler-related ocular vascular occlusion requires immediate retrobulbar hyaluronidase and aggressive ischemia-directed measures, though outcomes remain poor if delayed; and in younger patients with recurrent or multiple BRAOs, I should consider hypercoagulable states, Susac syndrome, or moyamoya disease and tailor the workup accordingly [^116nycZt] [^116ew4LS] [^1164Q7C1] [^111rQBRj].

> Let me reconsider prognosis to set expectations accurately. CRAO has a low rate of meaningful spontaneous visual recovery, with most eyes ending at 20/400 or worse, which reinforces the rationale for time-sensitive reperfusion attempts and early rehabilitation planning; RVO prognosis is better overall, especially in BRVO, but macular edema can persist for months to years and neovascular complications can emerge late, so longitudinal monitoring is essential [^116Z2C6S] [^114v7LnJ] [^111xHT5d].

> I should confirm follow-up cadence and what to monitor. After RAO, close neuro-ophthalmic and stroke follow-up is needed to assess for new events and reinforce secondary prevention; after RVO, monthly visits for the first 6 months help detect and treat neovascularization or macular edema recurrences, with gonioscopy to screen for angle neovascularization in ischemic CRVO; OCT and FA guide retreatment decisions, and patients should be linked to low vision rehabilitation when impairment persists [^116MeA4C] [^111e71Rp] [^113xthQw].

> In summary, I need to ensure the care pathway is explicit: classify the occlusion as arterial versus venous, activate stroke protocols urgently for RAO with consideration of thrombolysis in the appropriate window, treat RVO macular edema with anti-VEGF and manage neovascular complications with PRP, and in all cases perform a comprehensive systemic vascular workup with aggressive risk factor modification and GCA screening when indicated; this integrated approach addresses both vision and life-threatening vascular risks and aligns with contemporary guidelines and evidence [^117FhzjN] [^112FG7Fk] [^111xHT5d] [^111Xk8WW].

Retinal vascular occlusion (RVO) is a **sudden, painless vision loss** caused by blockage of retinal veins or arteries, most often due to thromboembolism or vascular compression [^117FhzjN] [^116HM25q]. CRAO is a **stroke equivalent** [^112FG7Fk] and requires **urgent stroke-center referral** within 4.5–6 hours for possible thrombolysis, plus rapid GCA exclusion and embolic workup [^115vD3Wp] [^112AHDBQ] [^115s6tYN] [^1164Q7C1]. CRVO/BRVO need **prompt anti-VEGF therapy** for macular edema [^1152dDdT], with PRP for neovascularization [^114W6s5P]; systemic risk-factor control is essential for both [^116pbBhU]. Visual prognosis is poor after CRAO [^116Z2C6S] but can improve with timely RVO treatment [^1152dDdT]; all patients require coordinated ophthalmic and systemic care to prevent recurrence and complications [^111SNFMY].

---

## Classification and pathophysiology

Retinal vascular occlusions are classified by vessel type and location: **central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO)** [^117FhzjN], **branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO)** [^111Wsvnp], **central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO)** [^111xHT5d], and **branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO)** [^114v7LnJ]. CRAO/BRAO usually result from embolic events (carotid or cardiac) [^112jDjvB] or thrombosis; CRVO/BRVO reflect venous thrombosis from compression, endothelial injury, or hypercoagulability [^116HM25q].

---

## Risk factors

- **Systemic**: Hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, carotid disease, hypercoagulable states, smoking [^113MoS3t] [^1164Q7C1] [^116SBRyR] [^113j1xMj].
- **Ocular**: Glaucoma, high intraocular pressure, optic disc drusen, retinal vascular disease [^117Tpzxu].
- **Age**: Incidence rises with age, peaking near 80 [^112nTmd7].

---

## Clinical presentation

- **CRAO**: Sudden, painless, severe monocular vision loss; cherry-red spot, retinal whitening, boxcarring [^113hunJP].
- **BRAO**: Sudden, painless, sectoral visual field defect with corresponding retinal changes [^113hunJP].
- **CRVO/BRVO**: Blurred vision, retinal hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, macular edema, optic disc edema [^117Tpzxu].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Ophthalmic exam**: Visual acuity, intraocular pressure, slit-lamp, dilated fundus exam [^116MeA4C].
- **Imaging**: OCT (macular edema, retinal thickness), fluorescein angiography (perfusion, ischemia, neovascularization), OCTA (noninvasive vasculature) [^112jeAM6].
- **Systemic workup**: MRI/CT (stroke), carotid ultrasound, echocardiogram, ECG, labs (CBC, lipids, glucose, HbA1c, coagulation profile) [^113G2E62].

---

## Acute management

### Retinal artery occlusion (CRAO/BRAO)

- **Emergency care**: Immediate referral to stroke center within 4.5–6 hours [^112AHDBQ]; consider IV or IA thrombolysis (alteplase, tenecteplase) [^112AHDBQ].
- **Adjunctive measures**: Ocular massage, anterior chamber paracentesis, hyperbaric oxygen (limited evidence) [^116SBRyR].
- **Systemic workup**: Exclude GCA (ESR/CRP, temporal artery biopsy) [^115s6tYN]; evaluate carotid/cardiac embolic sources [^112jDjvB].

---

### Retinal vein occlusion (CRVO/BRVO)

- **Anti-VEGF therapy**: First-line for macular edema (ranibizumab, aflibercept, bevacizumab) [^111xHT5d].
- **Corticosteroids**: Intravitreal triamcinolone or dexamethasone implant for anti-VEGF refractory cases [^111xwX6j].
- **Laser photocoagulation**: For retinal/iris neovascularization and persistent macular edema [^114W6s5P].
- **Systemic risk control**: Optimize hypertension, diabetes, lipids; anticoagulation if indicated [^116pbBhU].

---

## Prognosis

CRAO has a **poor prognosis**, with only ~10% achieving meaningful vision recovery [^116Z2C6S]; BRAO fares better, with ~60% achieving ≥ 20/40 vision [^notfound]. CRVO/BRVO outcomes vary with ischemia severity; **anti-VEGF therapy significantly improves visual acuity** and reduces complications [^114v7LnJ].

---

## Complications

Complications include **macular edema** — the leading cause of vision loss in RVO [^111xHT5d] — and **neovascularization** of the retina/iris, which can cause vitreous hemorrhage and neovascular glaucoma [^114W6s5P]. Retinal ischemia leads to permanent vision loss, and recurrent occlusions are common without risk-factor control [^116Z2C6S].

---

## Preventive strategies

Preventive strategies emphasize **systemic risk-factor control** — managing hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation, and promoting smoking cessation [^116pbBhU]. Regular ophthalmic follow-up enables early detection and treatment of complications [^116MeA4C], and patient education should stress symptom recognition and the importance of prompt care [^1171dfzr].

---

## Emerging therapies and research

- **Thrombolysis**: Ongoing RCTs evaluating IV/IA thrombolysis for CRAO [^notfound].
- **Neuroprotection**: Investigated to limit retinal ischemic injury [^116Lvw1f].
- **AI**: Potential for early detection and risk stratification [^116zUiRg].

---

Retinal vascular occlusion is a sight-threatening emergency requiring rapid diagnosis and coordinated ophthalmic-systemic care; **early, evidence-based therapy improves outcomes** and reduces recurrence [^113G2E62].

## References

### Retinal vascular occlusions [^117FhzjN]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Acute retinal vascular occlusions are common causes of visual impairment. Although both retinal artery occlusions and retinal vein occlusions are associated with increased age and cardiovascular risk factors, their pathophysiology, systemic implications, and management differ substantially. Acute management of retinal artery occlusions involves a multidisciplinary approach including neurologists with stroke expertise, whereas treatment of retinal vein occlusions is provided by ophthalmologists. Optimisation of systemic risk factors by patients' primary care providers is an important component of the management of these two disorders.

### Management of central retinal artery occlusion: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112FG7Fk]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is a form of acute ischemic stroke that causes severe visual loss and is a harbinger of further cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events. There is a paucity of scientific information on the appropriate management of CRAO, with most strategies based on observational literature and expert opinion. In this scientific statement, we critically appraise the literature on CRAO and provide a framework within which to consider acute treatment and secondary prevention.

Methods

We performed a literature review of randomized controlled clinical trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, case-control studies, case reports, clinical guidelines, review articles, basic science articles, and editorials concerning the management of CRAO. We assembled a panel comprising experts in the fields of vascular neurology, neuro-ophthalmology, vitreo-retinal surgery, immunology, endovascular neurosurgery, and cardiology, and document sections were divided among the writing group members. Each member received an assignment to perform a literature review, synthesize the data, and offer considerations for practice. Multiple drafts were circulated among the group until consensus was achieved.

Results

Acute CRAO is a medical emergency. Systems of care should evolve to prioritize early recognition and triage of CRAO to emergency medical attention. There is considerable variability in management patterns among practitioners, institutions, and subspecialty groups. The current literature suggests that treatment with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator may be effective. Patients should undergo urgent screening and treatment of vascular risk factors. There is a need for high-quality, randomized clinical trials in this field.

### A review of central retinal artery occlusion: clinical presentation and management [^1145KTcX]. Eye (2013). Low credibility.

Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is an ophthalmic emergency and the ocular analogue of cerebral stroke. Best evidence reflects that over three-quarters of patients suffer profound acute visual loss with a visual acuity of 20/400 or worse. This results in a reduced functional capacity and quality of life. There is also an increased risk of subsequent cerebral stroke and ischaemic heart disease. There are no current guideline-endorsed therapies, although the use of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been investigated in two randomized controlled trials. This review will describe the pathophysiology, epidemiology, and clinical features of CRAO, and discuss current and future treatments, including the use of tPA in further clinical trials.

Branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) management — multiple treatments have been proposed; however, there are currently insufficient data to demonstrate any conclusive benefits from intervention beyond the natural history of the disease, and when presented with an asymptomatic BRAO, the most important approach is a systemic evaluation including a careful medical history and an assessment for systemic disease, preferably in conjunction with the patient's internist.

### Artificial intelligence in therapeutic management of hyperlipidemic ocular pathology [^116zUiRg]. Experimental Eye Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyperlipidemia has many ocular manifestations, the most prevalent being retinal vascular occlusion. Hyperlipidemic lesions and occlusions to the vessels supplying the retina result in permanent blindness, necessitating prompt detection and treatment. Retinal vascular occlusion is diagnosed using different imaging modalities, including optical coherence tomography angiography. These diagnostic techniques obtain images representing the blood flow through the retinal vessels, providing an opportunity for AI to utilize image recognition to detect blockages and abnormalities before patients present with symptoms. AI is already being used as a non-invasive method to detect retinal vascular occlusions and other vascular pathology, as well as predict treatment outcomes. As providers see an increase in patients presenting with new retinal vascular occlusions, the use of AI to detect and treat these conditions has the potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce the financial burden on the healthcare system. This article comprehends the implications of AI in the current management strategies of retinal vascular occlusion (RVO) in hyperlipidemia and the recent developments of AI technology in the management of ocular diseases.

### Retinal and ophthalmic artery occlusions preferred practice pattern ® [^115gYrMR]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Retinal artery occlusions (RAO) management — emergent evaluation and stroke pathway: Acute, symptomatic, posterior segment arterial occlusions represent an emergent ophthalmic condition and require prompt evaluation. The rate of silent cerebral ischemia in RAO is the same as in hemispheric TIA, and the recommendation from multiple clinical trials is that a TIA be worked up as stroke in the acute phase. Given the expected similarity of pathogenesis, patients with RAO should be considered in the same way. Immediate referral to an emergency department affiliated with a stroke center for a medical evaluation is advised. If a stroke center is not available, an emergency department is the next option.

### Current best clinical practices-management of retinal vein occlusion [^1152dDdT]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is the second most common cause of vision loss from retinal vascular diseases in adults in the United States. Visual loss arises as a result of a host of factors, including macular ischemia and macular edema. Primary antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy is the current standard of care, with level I evidence demonstrating sustained visual gains up to 2 years after treatment in both branch and central RVO. Prompt antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy is important because delays in treatment yield lesser visual gains. Steroid therapy also improves visual outcomes in RVO but with higher rates of adverse effects, including cataract formation and ocular hypertension. Although the treatment burden can be high, these drugs have collectively revolutionized treatment outcomes in this disease state, providing improved visual outcomes over previous laser therapies.

### Do patients with retinal artery occlusion need urgent neurologic evaluation? [^112jDjvB]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe a framework for logical, immediate action to manage patients with retinal artery occlusion.

Design

Literature review and perspective.

Methods

Review of the literature and the author's experience.

Results

Since embolism is the most common factor causing retinal artery occlusion, to manage these patients, immediate evaluation and management of the source of embolism is critical to prevent further episodes.

Conclusions

The logical, immediate action to manage patients with retinal artery occlusion is evaluation of the carotid artery and heart for embolism, fasting lipid levels and a complete blood count, rather than neurological evaluation, unless, of course, there are neurological symptoms.

### Expert opinion on management of intraocular inflammation, retinal vasculitis, and vascular occlusion after brolucizumab treatment [^112JYF13]. Ophthalmology: Retina (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Recent reports have described a spectrum of uncommon findings of intraocular inflammation (IOI), retinal vasculitis, or retinal vascular occlusion in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) treated with intravitreal injection (IVI) of brolucizumab. We present guidance on the clinical presentation of this spectrum and propose recommendations for management of these events.

Design

PubMed literature review and expert opinion panel.

Participants

A working group of international medical experts and Novartis medical personnel.

Methods

The working group deliberated on the clinical presentations and used a 3-pronged approach to develop management recommendations based on (1) critical appraisal of scientific literature; (2) clinical insights from the HAWK and HARRIER trials, postmarketing reports, and assessments from an independent Safety Review Committee (SRC); and (3) their clinical experience.

Main Outcome Measures

Management recommendations for a spectrum of ocular inflammatory events after treatment with brolucizumab or other anti-vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs).

Results

Based on insights gained from the available information and the expertise of the contributors, recommendations were proposed for ocular examinations, imaging modalities, and treatment strategies for management of this spectrum of events. Patients should be educated to promptly report any relevant or persistent symptoms after IVI to facilitate timely intervention. Patients diagnosed with IOI should be evaluated for concomitant retinal vasculitis or retinal vascular occlusive events. Clinical examination can be augmented with multimodal imaging techniques, including widefield imaging, fluorescein angiography (with peripheral sweeps), and OCT. Once confirmed, the ongoing brolucizumab treatment should be suspended and intensive treatment with potent corticosteroids (topical, subtenon, intravitreal, or systemic) is recommended, which may be supplemented with other treatment strategies depending on the severity. Based on the clinical outcome of these events, individualized treatment with locally available standard of care should be considered for the underlying nAMD.

Conclusions

These recommendations emphasize the need for early diagnosis, prompt and timely intervention, intensive treatment, and frequent monitoring to minimize the risk of progression of these events. The proposed recommendations may facilitate a consistent management approach of this spectrum of ocular inflammatory events should they arise in nAMD after treatment with brolucizumab or other anti-VEGFs.

### Central retinal artery occlusion: a stroke of the eye [^112WD3iT]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), like a stroke in the brain, is a critical eye condition that requiring urgent medical attention. Patients with CRAO present with acute loss of vision and the visual prognosis is poor with low chance of spontaneous visual recovery. Moreover, the risk of developing ischaemic heart disease and cerebral stroke is increased due to the presence of underlying atherosclerotic risk factors. Currently, there is no officially recommended treatment for CRAO. This review will describe the anatomy, pathophysiology, clinical features of CRAO, as well as exploring existing and potential future approaches for managing the condition.

### Summary benchmarks-full set – 2024 [^112AWRWE]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Retinal and ophthalmic artery occlusions — care management includes age- and presentation-specific directives. "Physicians should first consider GCA in patients 50 years of age or older", and "In cases of GCA, physicians should consider urgent systemic corticosteroid therapy to prevent vision loss in the fellow eye or vascular occlusion elsewhere", while "Patients with diabetes with GCA should be carefully monitored since systemic corticosteroid treatment may destabilize glucose control". Care pathways specify that "Ophthalmologists should refer patients with retinal vascular disease to the appropriate setting, depending on the nature of the retinal occlusion". For emergencies, "Acute, symptomatic OAO, CRAO, and BRAO from embolic etiologies should prompt an immediate referral to the nearest stroke center or emergency department for prompt assessment for consideration of intervention", and for asymptomatic branch occlusion, "When presented with an asymptomatic BRAO, clinicians should conduct a systemic evaluation (careful medical history, assessment for systemic disease), preferably in conjunction with the patient's internist".

### Myths and truths of the association of retinal vascular occlusion with COVID-19 [^114HkxXo]. Retina (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To critically review data published in the recent past to scrutinize a causal relationship between retinal vascular occlusion and COVID-19.

Method

A comprehensive literature search was performed on Pubmed with the key words retinal vascular occlusion, retinal vein occlusion, retinal artery occlusion, and COVID-19.

Results

A total of 17 case reports were published during this period, and 10 were on retinal vein occlusion and 7 on retinal artery occlusion. Most of the published reports lacked convincing evidences in one or the other aspects, such as insufficient laboratory workup or presence of multiple confounding risk factors.

Conclusion

In this index article, strength of the data is insufficient to establish a definitive cause-and-effect relationship of retinal vascular occlusive disorders with COVID-19. Hence, clinicians can continue to manage these cases according to the standard guidelines until there are more robust evidences to support this association to alter the diagnostic and treatment modalities.

### Management of acute retinal ischemia: follow the guidelines! [^113G2E62]. Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Acute retinal arterial ischemia, including vascular transient monocular vision loss (TMVL) and branch (BRAO) and central retinal arterial occlusions (CRAO), are ocular and systemic emergencies requiring immediate diagnosis and treatment. Guidelines recommend the combination of urgent brain magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion-weighted imaging, vascular imaging, and clinical assessment to identify TMVL, BRAO, and CRAO patients at highest risk for recurrent stroke, facilitating early preventive treatments to reduce the risk of subsequent stroke and cardiovascular events. Because the risk of stroke is maximum within the first few days after the onset of visual loss, prompt diagnosis and triage are mandatory. Eye care professionals must make a rapid and accurate diagnosis and recognize the need for timely expert intervention by immediately referring patients with acute retinal arterial ischemia to specialized stroke centers without attempting to perform any further testing themselves. The development of local networks prompting collaboration among optometrists, ophthalmologists, and stroke neurologists should facilitate such evaluations, whether in a rapid-access transient ischemic attack clinic, in an emergency department-observation unit, or with hospitalization, depending on local resources.

### Retinal vein occlusions preferred practice pattern ® [^111xHT5d]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Medical and surgical management of RVO — consequences of untreated RVOs and vision loss include an economic burden on patients, their family, and society. Anti-VEGF agents, laser surgery, and intravitreal corticosteroids are effective and cost-effective for the management of RVOs, and the choice of treatment should be individually tailored based on discussion among the patient, family, and physician. Current treatment strategies for RVO target the sequelae of the venous occlusion (i.e., macular edema and NVD/NVE) rather than treating the occlusion itself.

### Central retinal artery occlusion: a stroke of the eye [^117HCVhs]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

An arterial occlusion of the eye is the ocular equivalent of a cerebral stroke. The clinical presentation depends on the site and degree of occlusion and the visual outcome is dependent upon if the ischaemic changes are transient or permanent.

At presentation, a symptomatic retinal artery occlusion (RAO) is an ophthalmic emergency. Patients typically present with sudden, painless, monocular vision loss and the visual prognosis can be poor with 61% of central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) patients having vision of counting finger or worse. At present, there is no definitive evidenced based treatment guideline for RAOs that has been found to be superior in terms of efficacy for the condition.

In 2013, the American Heart Association (AHA)/American Stroke Association updated their stroke classifications and included CRAO and branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO). The aetiology and pathophysiological mechanisms of ischaemic stroke and RAO are very similar with thromboembolism resulting in vascular occlusion and end organ damage. There is an analogy in the management principle; the management of acute CRAO is like the principles of stroke treatment, with an aim to restore perfusion if possible and to optimise atherosclerotic control to prevent further ischaemic events.

This review aims to provide an overview of RAO, an update on its management and a practical guideline to manage patients presenting with RAOs.

### Central retinal artery occlusion: a stroke of the eye [^115RNKsD]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

A structured search was conducted using the MEDLINE database (via PubMed) for this review. The following terms were used in various combinations: 'central retinal artery occlusion', 'branch retinal artery occlusion', 'retinal artery occlusion' with 'epidemiology', 'pathogenesis', 'classification', 'investigation', 'management' and 'therapeutics', to identify relevant articles for inclusion in this review. All articles' titles and abstracts were used to select articles, if deemed to be appropriate for inclusion, the full article was downloaded and analysed by the authors. There was no restriction in study design or article type for inclusion in this review, all bibliographies from included studies were reviewed to identify any additional relevant articles. All studies published until the 8th of November 2023 were assessed for inclusion.

### Retinal vein thrombosis: the internist's role in the etiologic and therapeutic management [^111QfE8K]. Thrombosis Research (2016). Low credibility.

Retinal vein occlusion is a common and important cause of vision loss. In general, knowledge about this condition is scant within an internist's practice but the condition is relevant because of its association with other chronic ailments. A diagnosis of RVO should prompt the investigation of conditions needing chronic management in these patients. In this review we summarize the clinical presentation of RVO, its classification, associated risk factors, and treatment focused in the internist's scope of practice.

### Retinal vein occlusions preferred practice pattern ® [^116pbBhU]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) — clinical objectives — include to identify patients at risk for developing RVO; encourage management of potential risk factors for both CRVO and BRVO, including optimizing systemic blood pressure and diabetes as well as control of glaucoma and ocular hypertension; increase awareness of both ophthalmologists and primary care physicians of the higher risk of cardiovascular and stroke complications in patients presenting with RVO; monitor for signs of posterior or anterior segment neovascularization and neovascular glaucoma in all eyes with most RVOs, because a nonischemic can become an ischemic RVO; treat or follow patients who have vision loss or those at risk for vision loss after RVO and consider a systemic workup for patients under 50 years of age; minimize treatment side effects that might adversely impact vision and/or vision-related quality of life; and provide or refer the patient for visual rehabilitation services when permanent visual impairment results from the disease.

Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is considered to be an acute stroke of the eye that results in profound visual loss. Spontaneous recovery rates are poor. Most CRAOs are caused by thromboembolism in the central retinal artery. Current standard therapies for CRAO that aim to restore perfusion to the retina and optic nerve head have not been shown to alter the natural course of the disease. Thrombolytic therapy for acute management of CRAO has shown promise in nonrandomized studies with regard to improving visual outcomes. A randomized controlled trial will be required to confirm the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy before it can be recommended for use in CRAO in daily clinical practice.

### Retina summary benchmarks – 2024 [^115rPBKv]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Retinal and ophthalmic artery occlusions (care management) — physicians should first consider GCA in patients 50 years of age or older, and in cases of GCA, physicians should consider urgent systemic corticosteroid therapy to prevent vision loss in the fellow eye or vascular occlusion elsewhere; patients with diabetes with GCA should be carefully monitored since systemic corticosteroid treatment may destabilize glucose control. Ophthalmologists should refer patients with retinal vascular disease to the appropriate setting, depending on the nature of the retinal occlusion, and acute, symptomatic OAO, CRAO, and BRAO from embolic etiologies should prompt an immediate referral to the nearest stroke center or emergency department for prompt assessment for consideration of intervention. When presented with an asymptomatic BRAO, clinicians should conduct a systemic evaluation (careful medical history, assessment for systemic disease), preferably in conjunction with the patient's internist.

### Retinal and ophthalmic artery occlusions preferred practice pattern ® [^1164Q7C1]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Retinal and ophthalmic artery occlusions — acute management and stroke evaluation emphasize urgent referral, targeted systemic workup, and selective outpatient evaluation. Once a diagnosis of an acute, symptomatic CRAO, BRAO, or OAO has been made, the ophthalmologist should refer to an emergency department affiliated with a stroke center for prompt systemic evaluation, with clear instructions that the patient has experienced an eye "stroke", and an expedited workup offers the best opportunity to evaluate, assess, and manage the risk for cerebral stroke or myocardial infarction. In addition, corticosteroids should be initiated empirically and a temporal artery biopsy scheduled in patients with high clinical suspicion for GCA. In the absence of a clear etiology such as an embolus, the workup should include evaluation for antiphospholipid antibodies and other hematologic diatheses, and autoimmune or other hypercoagulable states; Susac syndrome should be considered in younger patients with multiple or recurrent BRAOs, and clinicians should inquire about signs or symptoms of carotid dissection. Poor choroidal circulation on fluorescein angiography or indocyanine green angiography is suggestive of OAO or GCA. At present, there is no conclusive evidence to support referring asymptomatic patients who have a BRAO or asymptomatic plaques for an expedited stroke workup; these patients should be referred to their primary care physician for a comprehensive systemic vascular workup on an outpatient basis. Stroke risk associated with newly diagnosed OAO, CRAO, or BRAO may be as high as 25%.

### Management of retinal vascular diseases: a patient-centric approach [^111NvhTR]. Eye (2012). Low credibility.

Retinal vascular diseases are a leading cause of blindness in the Western world. Advancement in the clinical management of these diseases has been fast-paced, with new treatments becoming available as well as license extensions of existing treatments. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been implicated in certain retinal vascular diseases, including wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic macular oedema (DMO), and retinal vein occlusion (RVO). Treatment of wet AMD and visual impairment due to either DMO or macular oedema secondary to RVO with an anti-VEGF on an as needed basis, rather than a fixed schedule, allows an individualised treatment approach; providing treatment when patients are most likely to benefit from it, while minimising the number of unnecessary intravitreal injections. Thus, an individualised treatment regimen reduces the chances of over-treatment and under-treatment, optimising both the risk/benefit profile of the treatment and the efficient use of NHS resource. Streamlining of treatment for patients with wet AMD and visual impairment due to either DMO or macular oedema secondary to RVO, by using one treatment with similar posology across all three diseases, may help to minimise burden of clinic capacity and complexity and hence optimise patient outcomes. Informed treatment decisions and efficient clinic throughput are important for optimal patient outcomes in the fast-changing field of retinal vascular diseases.

### Systematic review of clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of retinal vein occlusion [^111se7Hd]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

To assess the methodological quality of Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) for the diagnosis and management of Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO).

Methods

A systematic review of CPGs for the diagnosis and management of RVO was carried out with a search in databases, metasearch engines, CPG development institutions, ophthalmology associations and CPG repositories until April 2022. Search update was performed on April 2023, with no new record available. Five CPGs published in the last 10 years in English/Spanish were selected, and 5 authors evaluated them independently, using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE-II) instrument. An individual assessment of each CPG by domain (AGREE-II), an overall assessment of the guide, and its use with or without modifications were performed. Additionally, a meta-synthesis of the recommendations for the most relevant outcomes was carried out.

Results

The lowest score (mean 18.8%) was for domain 5 'applicability', and the highest score (mean 62%) was for domain 4 'clarity of presentation'. The 2019 American guideline (PPP) presented the best score (40.4%) in domain 3 'rigour of development'. When evaluating the overall quality of the CPGs analysed, all CPGs could be recommended with modifications. In the meta-synthesis, anti-VEGF therapy is the first-choice therapy for macular oedema associated with RVO, but there is no clear recommendation about the type of anti-VEGF therapy to choose. Recommendations for diagnosis and follow-up are similar among the CPGs appraised.

Conclusion

Most CPGs for the diagnosis and management of RVO have a low methodological quality assessed according to the AGREE-II. PPP has the higher score in the domain 'rigour of development'. Among the CPGs appraised, there is no clear recommendation on the type of anti-VEGF therapy to choose.

### Retrobulbar hyaluronidase in hyaluronic acid-induced ocular vascular occlusion: efficacy, challenges, and implications for clinical practice [^116ew4LS]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ophthalmic vascular occlusion due to hyaluronic acid (OVOH) is a rare but devastating complication of cosmetic filler injections, often resulting in severe vision loss.

Materials

The methodology involved a systematic search across PubMed, NCBI, Google Scholar, and Cochrane to investigate factors influencing central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) caused by fillers. Searches focused on "eye vascular anatomy", "ocular physiology in response to ischemia", "components AND hyaluronic acid AND inflammation", "recovery from blindness associated with fillers", "retrobulbar technique", and "hyaluronidase degradation AND fillers". This review examines the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and management of OVOH by synthesizing findings from case reports, clinical studies, and experimental research. It elucidates retinal vascular anatomy, HA embolization mechanisms, and treatment efficacy, highlighting the critical importance of timely intervention.

Results

OVOH typically presents with rapid vision loss within minutes of HA injection, often accompanied by severe ocular pain. The primary treatment, hyaluronidase (HYAL), is most effective when administered early, although retrobulbar HYAL shows limited overall success. Factors such as ischemia duration and the presence of cilioretinal arteries significantly influence retinal survival and recovery. The review discusses the complexities of retinal hypoxia and the implications of various intervention strategies.

Conclusion

Timely intervention is crucial for managing OVOH. Although retrobulbar HYAL remains a key treatment option, its effectiveness varies and necessitates optimization. Early and accurate diagnosis is essential, underscoring the need for further research to refine treatment strategies and improve outcomes for patients with retinal vascular occlusions.

### Neuroprotection for nonarteritic central retinal artery occlusion: lessons from acute ischemic stroke [^116Lvw1f]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Neuroprotective Therapeutics and Strategies

Mechanisms for treating CRAO have focused on re-establishing retinal vascular perfusion. However, a review of stroke management shows that multiple strategies are employed to manage both the acute and after-effects of cerebral injury. The multipronged approach used in managing AIS should also be employed in CRAO patients to modify the disease outcome favorably. It is known that secondary injuries occur after the acute stroke event. The secondary injuries are due to other mechanisms that occur several hours and days after the acute injury and involve further loss of cells in the penumbra. Neuroprotection aims to rescue and preserve those viable cells in the hypoperfused area marked for delayed cell death.

Understanding the current state of research into neuroprotection for AIS and its limitations is essential to neuroprotection for CRAO. Despite several decades of preclinical and clinical studies exploring neuroprotection for stroke, no neuroprotective therapy has made it into clinical guidelines or been generally adopted. The success of preclinical trials has yet to be replicated in clinical studies for cerebral neuroprotection after stroke. One can summarize the translational failures of preclinical trials reported by Chamorro as primarily due to different forms of bias, such as selecting study participants, assessment, attrition, generalizability, and study relevance. There was a need for more methodological agreement between preclinical and clinical studies. Issues with the therapeutic window, power of the study, the certainty of recanalization, and heterogeneity of the human stroke and participating sample weakened previous studies. These known causes of translational failure in AIS are relevant considerations in CRAO too.

### Retinal vein occlusions, from basics to the latest treatment [^111WYZR6]. Retina (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

To review the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and updated treatments of retinal vein occlusions (RVOs).

Methods

A review of the literature was performed, focusing on the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatments (including both medical and surgical treatments) of RVO. Based on this review, a comprehensive overview was provided regarding the topic of RVO and focused on recent treatment updates.

Results

Retinal vein occlusions have an age- and sex-standardized prevalence of 5.20 per 1,000 for any RVO, 4.42 per 1,000 for branch RVO, 0.80 per 1,000 for central RVO. Worldwide, an estimated 16.4 million adults are affected by RVOs, with 2.5 million affected by central RVO and 13.9 million affected by branch RVO. Retinal vein occlusion is recognized as an important cause of blindness and the diagnostic approaches and treatment options for RVO are reviewed and reported. The current treatment options including medical treatments (bevacizumab, ranibizumab, aflibercept, triamcinolone, and dexamethasone implants) and surgical alternatives were reviewed and reported with summaries on the corresponding strength of evidence.

Conclusion

Despite the understanding of this disease entity, challenges persist in the long-term treatment of RVO-related complications and visual loss. This review provided a detailed summary on the rationality and efficacy of recently developed treatment regimes and evaluated the potential benefit of combination therapy.

Retinal vein occlusions (RVOs) preferred practice pattern — highlighted findings and care recommendations state that prognosis varies by occlusion site and type, and that in general "more-distal RVOs with less occlusion have a better prognosis than more-proximal RVOs with greater ischemia". Central retinal vein occlusions (CRVOs) and hemi-CRVOs "have clinically similar courses", are "associated with glaucoma" and "have a higher risk of anterior segment neovascularization and neovascular glaucoma than branch retinal vein occlusion has", and "It is important to control intraocular pressure (IOP) for glaucoma management in conjunction with the ophthalmologist's care process for the patient's glaucoma condition". "Macular edema may complicate both CRVOs and branch retinal vein occlusions (BRVOs)". For associated macular edema, "The first line of treatment… is intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents (anti- VEGFs)", while "Intravitreal corticosteroids have demonstrated efficacy but have the associated risks of glaucoma and cataract formation", and "Laser photocoagulation surgery is sometimes used in BRVO". Regarding biologics, "The choice of biologic product — reference, biosimilar, or interchangeable — should be that of the treating ophthalmologist and the patient because the patient may respond more favorably to one biologic over another". Systemic management emphasizes that "it is important to control systemic arterial hypertension, diabetes, and serum lipid levels", and "Patients with any RVO have an increased risk of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality".

Methods

Search methods for identifying studies

We conducted a systematic review using search strategies with Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms for iCRVO and clinical outcomes to identify relevant studies. A similar search was performed for economic outcomes; however, the search strategy was not restricted by ischemia-related terms. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Health Technology Assessment (HTA) database, and the Campbell Collaboration Library of Systematic Reviews. In addition to the above literature sources the UK National Health Service (NHS) Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) was searched for economic studies. The searches were limited to the period January 2004–March 2015, as guidelines on management of CRVO by the UK Royal College of Ophthalmologists were first published in 2004, and to the English language and human studies. Conference proceedings from EURetina, Royal College of Ophthalmologists (available for 2013 and 2014), American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO), and International Society of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) were also searched for 2004–2015. The search strategy for the PubMed database is shown in Table 1.

### Intravitreal steroid and anti-vascular endothelial growth agents for the management of retinal vein occlusion: evidence from randomized trials [^117WoJxd]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is a common retinal vascular disorder, affecting visual acuity and quality of life. Macular edema (ME) and retinal ischemia are the main causes for visual impairment in RVO. Although several modalities have been evaluated for the treatment of ME secondary to RVO in clinical trials, various questions need to be clarified when translating clinical trials into real-world practice.

Areas Covered

Intravitreal steroids and anti-VEGF agents are now widely used for the treatment of ME due to RVO. Herein, evidence from randomized controlled trials regarding the use of steroids and anti-VEGF agents in ME related to RVO are presented. In addition, an approach regarding the optimal treatment regimen, the most suitable time for initiating treatment and monitoring patients, as well as the potential role of ischemia in the response to treatment and the impact of treatment on the natural course of the disease was made.

Expert Opinion

A comprehensive presentation of randomized clinical trials evaluating intravitreal steroids and anti-VEGF treatment for RVO indicates that both are effective and safe. However, the comparative effectiveness of the various anti-VEGF agents, the most suitable dosing regimen and the effect of these agents on retinal ischemia remains unclear.

### Radiation retinopathy: detection and management strategies [^112BHugf]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Fundus Fluorescein Angiography

The primary lesion responsible for the manifestations of radiation retinopathy is vascular endothelial damage and thus can lead to variable degrees of vascular occlusion. The vascular obliteration can range from retinal capillary obliteration, retinal arterial branch occlusion, or central retinal artery occlusion. Retinal veins, although less susceptible to damage, have also been reported. Capillary non-perfusion areas are one of the most consistent findings in RR and appear before larger vessels are affected. The authors suggested that the finding is so common that the diagnosis of radiation retinopathy is difficult to entertain without it. Other changes visible on angiography include microaneurysms, hypo-fluorescence from retinal hemorrhages, nerve fiber layer infarcts, and leakage due to perivascular sheathing, intraretinal exudation, and retinal or optic disk neovascularization.

Amoaku et al used fluorescein angiography to classify changes in radiation retinopathy based on microvascular changes into four stages:
Grade 1: Small foci of dilated and irregular retinal capillaries along with isolated or small clusters of microaneurysms. Subtle evidence of capillary closure, without detectable microvascular incompetence or fluid accumulation, can be seen. Vision is usually very good.
Grade 2: Multiple foci of dilated and telangiectatic capillaries and zones of capillary closure up to one optic disc area. Usually, numerous microaneurysms and focal leakage of dye from defective capillaries in later phase angiograms can be seen. It may be associated with clinically observable retinal edema. Visual acuity is relatively good.
Grade 3: Characterised by widespread capillary dilatation, telangiectatic-like channels, microvascular incompetence, and significant areas of capillary closure (1–4 disc areas). These eyes can have significant macular edema with or without cystoid macular degenerative changes. Microaneurysms and intra-retinal microvascular abnormalities commonly occur at the border of perfused and non-perfused retina. These eyes usually have poor visual acuity.
Grade 4: Characterised by widespread disorganization of the retinal microvasculature with extensive inner retinal ischemia, non-perfused retina more than four disc-areas, pre-retinal neovascularisation, rubeosis iridis and vitreous hemorrhage. Visual acuity is usually very poor.

### Central retinal artery occlusion: a stroke of the eye [^115r5t4R]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Management

The management of CRAO and related syndromes in recent times has become an increasing area of interest. This is due to the combination of significant visual morbidity associated with the condition, and drawing synergy from stroke management to look at acute reperfusion strategies. The American Heart Association Scientific Statement on the management of CRAO has noted considerable variability in management patterns among practitioners, institutions and subspecialty groups. The development of local networks require collaboration among optometrists or general practitioners, ophthalmologists and stroke neurologists to facilitate such evaluations. This may be in a rapid-access transient ischaemic attack clinic, in an emergency department-observation unit, or with hospitalisation, depending on local resources. The role of the treating ophthalmologist is to diagnose the acute CRAO and to be aware of the local resources available to the patient.

In general, the management of RAO is divided into three phases:

Acute: to determine if reperfusion of the occluded retinal artery is possible

Subacute: to prevent local complications

Chronic: secondary prevention to optimise atherosclerotic control and prevent future events

Acute treatment options

Time is critical in acute CRAO. Duration of ischaemia is directly associated with ganglion cell loss, with 240 min being the cut-off for massive irreversible retinal ischaemia. This is similar to the current thrombolysis protocol in stroke to deploy clot busting agent if a stroke presents within a 4.5 h window.

Thrombolysis is to use a clot busting agent to dissolve an arterial clot and restore perfusion. Indications for thrombolysis include ischaemic cerebral stroke presenting within 4.5 h of onset, acute coronary syndrome with > 2 h delay to angioplasty and large pulmonary embolisms with haemodynamic instability. In the case of CRAO and related syndromes, intravenous and intra-arterial thrombolysis have both been investigated. The initial thrombolytic agents include urokinase and streptokinase, but more recent thrombolytic agents include tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), alteplase and tenecteplase. Tenecteplase is of current research interest. It is genetically modified version of alteplase with higher fibrin specificity, increased resistance to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 inactivation and longer half-life allowing for a quick bolus delivery. However, it is FDA approved for acute myocardial infarction but not in acute ischaemic stroke. Tenectaplase is being increasingly used off label due to the advantages of a single-dose intravenous administration and also being more cost effective compared to alteplase.

### Systematic literature review of treatments for management of complications of ischemic central retinal vein occlusion [^112ZVmwC]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, there is no high-level evidence for any current intervention being effective in a population of exclusively iCRVO cases. Furthermore, there is no solid evidence that anti-VEGF treatment, which is highly effective in CRVO without ischemia, does anything to prevent neovascularization in iCRVO. According to published studies, existing treatments reduce only the complications of iCRVO and do not significantly improve vision impairment, or do so only temporarily. Notwithstanding the scarcity of studies, there is a pressing need for innovative curative and preventive treatments in iCRVO as none of the current treatments solve the significant clinical and economic burden of this blinding condition.

### Central retinal artery occlusion: a stroke of the eye [^1141oy9E]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

CRAO is an ocular emergency and is analogous to an ischaemic stroke. The risk factors associated with non-arteritic CRAO is like that of cerebrovascular accident or myocardial infarction. Whilst various reports suggest different treatment modes for CRAO, there is little evidence supporting an optimal management plan. After taking a thorough history, ocular examination and investigations, the principles of management of CRAO includes acute management to restore blood flow, subacute management to prevent secondary complications and secondary prevention.

### Sequential bilateral retinal artery occlusions with promising visual prognosis in a diabetic patient: a case report and literature review [^111sx3cV]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this case illustrates sequential occurrences of bilateral RAO in a diabetic patient and highlights the potential for a promising visual prognosis with timely intra-arterial thrombolysis, even in an individual at heightened risk for systemic vascular complications. This suggests that thrombolytic therapy may be a viable option in RAO patients, particularly those with early presentation and no significant contraindications. However, given the complexities of thrombolysis in diabetic patients with potential hypercoagulable states, individualized treatment strategies are essential. Beyond thrombolytic therapy, rigorous glycemic control and anticoagulant therapy should be integrated into comprehensive vascular management to reduce the risk of recurrence.

To further validate these findings, large-scale, multi-center clinical studies are urgently needed to define the indications and validate the efficacy and safety of thrombolytic therapy in diabetic patients with RAO, as well as to explore the underlying mechanisms linking diabetes, hypercoagulability, vascular occlusion and the effectiveness of thrombolytic therapy. These investigations could provide valuable insights to optimize treatment strategies and improve outcomes in this vulnerable population.

Future directions

There is a need for Level II evidence double-blinded randomised controlled trial to address the efficacy of thrombolysis compared to placebo in treating early CRAO within suitable therapeutic treatment window. The exploration of novel thrombolytic agent such as tenecteplase holds promise for forthcoming research endeavours. A collaborative approach is important to develop a system of care for the urgent recognition, triage, and management of CRAO in a manner like cerebral ischaemic stroke.

Recommended management

Based on currently available literature, patients presenting with CRAO, and related syndromes should be promptly reviewed with a view to initiate acute treatment if patient present within an allocated time window for consideration of thrombolysis. Patients should undergo thorough history taking and clinical assessment. Consideration should be given to any symptoms concerning for GCA, additional neurological symptoms and contraindications for tPA therapy. A review by an ophthalmologist should also be performed upon presentation. If patients are within the 4.5-h treatment window, they may be considered for IV-tPA with consultation from the stroke unit.

From an institutional perspective, the AHA recommend modification of current hospital code stroke protocols for CRAOs and related syndromes. They recommended the addition of a funduscopic examination and screening for arteritis. The guidelines emphasised the importance of stroke centres developing relationships with community optometrists and ophthalmologists to promote efficient pathways for RAO patients. Grory et al. also suggested public health campaigns to include CRAO symptoms as a component of potential stroke features to improve awareness regarding the time sensitive nature of RAOs.

In cases where the patient has a delayed presentation and is ineligible for IV-tPA, patients can commence antiplatelet therapy and be referred to stroke clinic for systemic workup with a view for secondary prevention.

### Retinal and ophthalmic artery occlusions preferred practice pattern ® [^112N5puG]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Retinal and ophthalmic artery occlusions — introduction and stroke linkage — note that symptomatic retinal artery occlusion (RAO) is associated with stroke and that the retina is considered part of the central nervous system; therefore, treatment of a retinal ischemic event "should therefore be approached the same way as a brain infarction". In 2013 the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association included retinal cell death in the definition of central nervous system infarction, which is brain, spinal cord, or retinal cell death attributable to ischemia based on objective evidence or on symptoms "persisting 24 hours or more or until death".

### Systematic literature review of treatments for management of complications of ischemic central retinal vein occlusion [^117DK1Hi]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

To understand the clinical and economic outcomes of treatments for managing complications of ischemic central retinal vein occlusion (iCRVO).

Methods

We conducted a systematic literature review by searching multiple databases and ophthalmology conferences from 2004 to 2015. Studies published in English language and populations of age ≥ 45 years were included. For clinical endpoints, we defined eligibility criteria as randomized controlled trials, prospective before-and-after study designs, and non-randomized studies reporting on treatments in patients with iCRVO. For economic endpoints, all types of study design except cost-of-illness studies were included. We evaluated the definitions of ischemia, clinical and economic endpoints, and rate of development of complications. Risk of bias was assessed for clinical studies using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool.

Results

A total of 20 studies (1338 patients) were included. Treatments included anti-vascular endothelial growth factors (anti-VEGFs), steroids, and procedures primarily targeting macular edema and neovascularization. Ischemia was not defined consistently in the included studies. The level of evidence was mostly low. Most treatments did not improve visual acuity significantly. Development of treatment complications ranged from 11 to 57%. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios reported for anti-VEGFs and steroids were below the accepted threshold of GB£30,000, but considering such treatments only ameliorate disease symptoms they seem relatively expensive.

Conclusions

There is a lack of evidence for any intervention being effective in iCRVO, especially in the prevention of neovascularisation. iCRVO poses a significant clinical and economic burden. There is a need to standardize the definition of ischemia, and for innovative treatments which can significantly improve visual outcomes and prevent neovascular complications.

Retinal vein occlusion — management of neovascularization: In branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) with retinal neovascularization, retinal laser photocoagulation surgery in the area of nonperfusion helps to decrease the risk of a vitreous hemorrhage, and in central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) with retinal and/or iris neovascularization, dense peripheral panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) is indicated; initial treatment with an anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agent is helpful for an immediate but not a sustained benefit and may improve the ability to deliver a complete laser surgery treatment.

Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) thrombolysis — evidence and American Heart Association (AHA) guidance indicate that a systematic review and meta-analysis suggested that the administration of intravenous thrombolytics within 4.5 hours of symptom onset was associated with a greater likelihood of favorable visual outcomes. The American Heart Association recommends modification of current hospital stroke protocols to include CRAO and related syndromes, and states that intravenous or intra-arterial antifibrinolytic therapy can be "considered" for acute CRAO if within 4.5 and 6 hours from symptom onset, respectively, but at this point there is insufficient evidence to definitively know if thrombolysis leads to better visual outcomes. There is a small risk of hemorrhagic stroke with thrombolytics, and there are currently three ongoing randomized clinical trials evaluating intravenous thrombolysis for acute CRAO ongoing in Europe.

### Retinal vein thrombosis: pathogenesis and management [^116v7XNF]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2010). Low credibility.

Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is the most common retinal vascular disease after diabetic retinopathy. Owing to its multifactorial nature, however, management of this condition remains a challenge. Of the two main types of RVO, branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) is more prevalent than central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). Most patients develop the disease at an elderly age, and more than half of them have associated systemic disorders (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidemia and/or diabetes mellitus). There is no evidence to suggest routine testing for heritable thrombophilias in patients with RVO. The main cause of the visual impairment is macular edema, while neovascularization of the retina and optic disc are the most serious complications leading to vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment and neovascular glaucoma. Macular grid laser photocoagulation is an effective treatment for macular edema in patients with BRVO and a visual acuity of 20/40 or less. Other treatment options for reducing the edema are intravitreal steroids, anti-VEGF drugs and vitrectomy. The recently introduced intravitreal application of steroids and anti-VEGF drugs may prove to be a better approach for improving visual acuity. Finally, scatter panretinal laserphotocoagulation can effectively treat neovascularization and its secondary complications.

### Sequential bilateral retinal artery occlusion [^112xecHQ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Central retinal arterial occlusion (CRAO) and branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) are considered forms of stroke, with similar clinical approach and management. CRAO is a serious ophthalmologic disease with a poor prognosis. The incidence of acute CRAO in the US is 8.5 per 100,000 people. Demographic characteristics of patients with CRAO and BRAO are consistent with those seen for other vascular disorders. The mean age of patients is between 60 and 65 years. More than 90% of patients with CRAO and BRAO are over the age of 40 years, although individuals as young as 12 years have been affected. Men are more commonly affected than women. Hypertension, smoking, and diabetes are more prevalent among patients with retinal artery occlusion (RAO) compared with controls. Patients presenting with CRAO often have previously undiagnosed vascular risk factors.

We report a case of sequential bilateral artery occlusion over a period of less than 24 hours, presenting initially with permanent BRAO followed by nonarteritic CRAO with cilioretinal artery sparing.

### Comorbidity in patients with branch retinal vein occlusion: case-control study [^1172KtwH]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

Our study supports the theory that branch retinal vein occlusion is a marker of progressive cardiovascular disease that should be included in the risk assessment of patients for preventive intervention. General practitioners play an important role in the medical management of branch retinal vein occlusion through the identification and management of modifiable risk factors. Our study supports the importance of following the guidelines for medical management suggested by the Royal College of Ophthalmologists and discussed in a recent review of management of retinal vein occlusion. Investigations and interventions prompted by the diagnosis of branch retinal vein occlusion should focus on arterial hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and diabetes. The condition in itself does not warrant anticoagulant treatment.

### Radiation retinopathy: detection and management strategies [^115KGsVr]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Differential Diagnosis

Clinical features of RR can be difficult to distinguish from other vascular diseases of the retina like diabetic retinopathy, hypertensive retinopathy, and other vascular occlusive disorders. Thus, a dilated ophthalmic examination, a careful documentation of history, along with a thorough review of the treatment records, is usually necessary to reach a diagnosis.

RR should be considered as a differential diagnosis after cephalic radiation for head and neck malignancies. Diabetic retinopathy and RR are closely associated and sometimes both may coexist. RPE atrophy and, possibly, unilaterality of the disease are the two features of RR that can distinguish it from diabetic retinopathy. There are also fewer microaneurysms in cases of RR as compared to diabetic retinopathy. Other conditions that can closely mimic radiation retinopathy are retinal vein occlusions, ocular ischemic syndrome, hypertensive retinopathy, Coats' disease, and parafoveal telangiectasia [12].

Apart from meticulous clinical examination and adequate history taking, newer multimodal imaging such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), OCT angiography (OCTA), fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) are useful in making diagnosis and treatment of RR.

### Systematic literature review of treatments for management of complications of ischemic central retinal vein occlusion [^1119Mfxh]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is a vascular disorder of the eye and a known cause of significant visual morbidity, including sudden blindness. The global burden of CRVO in adults is estimated to be 2.5 million. The incidence of CRVO increases with age by greater than 10-fold from 40 years of age to 65 years and older. The estimated annual direct cost for managing CRVO in the Medicare population was approximately $1.3 billion in 2006. In addition, the economic burden of CRVO is significantly higher than for glaucoma. The 1- and 3-year per-patient direct medical costs associated with CRVO are 24 and 15% higher, respectively, than costs associated with glaucoma, despite the prevalence of glaucoma being 24-fold greater than CRVO.

The available treatments for iCRVO are used off-label and are directed towards minimizing or delaying the onset of complications associated with CRVO, such as macular edema (ME) and neovascularization (NV). Complications of NV include neovascular glaucoma (NVG) and vitreous hemorrhage (VH), which can lead to severe visual morbidity and blindness.

CRVO has two forms: ischemic and non-ischemic. Non-ischemic CRVO is the milder form of the disease that may resolve on its own or may progress to the ischemic form. Ischemic CRVO (iCRVO) is more severe, resulting in NVG and/or VH. Diagnosis and characterization of the severity of CRVO can be achieved through funduscopy, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography. Ischemia in CRVO is identified by using various criteria based on findings from these examinations or tests. The exact epidemiology of iCRVO remains unknown; however, one study suggests that iCRVO constitutes about one-fifth of all CRVO cases. Another study estimates 15% of patients with non-ischemic CRVO progress to iCRVO within 4 months and that 34% progress within 3 years.

### Radiation retinopathy: detection and management strategies [^1153TVqF]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

A gradual shift in trend from primary enucleation to globe salvaging radiation therapy for the management of ocular tumors has resulted in the rise of several post-treatment ocular complications including radiation retinopathy. Radiation retinopathy is a chronic, progressive, and occlusive vasculopathy that can manifest anytime between 1 month to 15 years after starting radiation therapy. The aim of treatment in most of these cases is to prevent further vision loss. Treatment options such as laser photocoagulation, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor and intraviral steroids have been described. However, despite several advances in diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, a significant proportion of eyes with radiation retinopathy eventually go blind. This review summarises some of the clinical features, investigative modalities, and recent therapeutic strategies used in the management of radiation retinopathy.

Acute retinal and ophthalmic artery occlusions — acute, symptomatic ophthalmic artery occlusion (OAO), central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), and branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) are medical emergencies and require prompt evaluation. Growing evidence recommends that acute RAO (symptoms within 24 hours) be treated as a medical emergency and be referred immediately to an emergency department or stroke center facility for neurological evaluation due to the increased risk of central nervous system stroke. Following a CRAO, the risk of ischemic stroke is highest during the first 1 to 4 weeks, ranging from 3% to 6%, and up to 24% of patients with RAO have concurrent cerebrovascular accidents on diffusion-weighted MRI. In one study of 112 consecutive acute RAO patients evaluated within 24 hours, the majority (77/112) had CRAO or BRAO confirmed by exam, and silent brain infarction was present in 19% of CRAO and 25% of BRAO cases. Patients with symptomatic RAO have the highest risk of stroke during the 2 weeks before and 1 month after the occlusion, and current evidence for effective interventional ocular treatment, other than corticosteroids for GCA, is controversial and limited to level II data.

Retinal vein occlusions — optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides high-resolution imaging of the macula to detect macular edema, vitreoretinal interface changes, and subretinal fluid, and it is used alongside visual acuity to guide management decisions, although retinal thickness does not always correlate with vision. Optical coherence tomography provides high-resolution imaging of the macula and is extremely useful to detect the presence and extent of any macular edema, vitreoretinal interface changes, and subretinal fluid. Large clinical trials testing anti-VEGF treatment are based primarily on quantifiable OCT measurements rather than on the more subjective stereoscopic photographs or clinical examination to evaluate and follow macular edema. In clinical practice, treatment decisions are commonly based on OCT measurements. For example, the decision to repeat anti-VEGF injections, change therapeutic agents (e.g., intraocular corticosteroids), initiate laser surgery, or even consider vitrectomy surgery is frequently based on both visual acuity and OCT findings. Nevertheless, retinal thickness, even when measured by OCT, does not always correlate with visual acuity.

### Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for central retinal artery occlusion: patient selection and perspectives [^116SBRyR]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Having the central retinal artery completely occluded can result in retinal ischemia and infarction, in addition to temporary visual loss. Emboli are formed by carotid artery or cardiac plaque, the latter of which is typically induced by atrial fibrillation, in a manner similar to that of an ischemic cerebrovascular accident in that they are commonly caused by a carotid artery or cardiac plaque.

Retinal ischemia -CRAO- is considered to be the ocular counterpart of a stroke of the cerebral vasculature, and patients suffering from CRAO should be treated with the utmost care. When a patient has CRAO, they are at a greater risk of developing concurrent or subsequent ischemia in other end organs, particularly in the brain. In spite of the fact that most ophthalmologists are aware of the systemic and neurologic implications of CRAO, the strategy to treating this condition continues to be a source of substantial ambiguity in the field. A narrow time window for effective treatment of CRAO and a high rate of serious comorbid illness exist. Thus, when CRAO is diagnosed in an ophthalmology, optometry, neurology, or primary clinic, immediate triage to an emergency department is necessary and should not be delayed to obtain further outpatient evaluation or institute other treatments. Stroke centers should develop relationships with community ophthalmologists and optometrists to promote efficient pathways for transfer of patients with CRAO. The vast majority of experts agree that it is vital to address the CRAO as an embolic event and to do an interdisciplinary full cardiological and neurological diagnostic workup to identify and treat potential hazards and causal factors as soon as possible after the CRAO has occurred. It is estimated that the chance of getting a stroke more than doubles within three years of having a CRAO. On multiple occasions, it has been demonstrated that obstruction of the central retinal artery is related with various vascular events such as myocardial infarction and acute ischemic stroke, among others. As a result, the American Heart Associationand the National Stroke Associationrecommend that all patients with retinal ischemia -CRAO- should be evaluated for cardiovascular disease in the same way that other patients who have suffered a cerebral vascular accident should be evaluated for cardiovascular disease. The key risk factors for retinal artery occlusions have been discovered in numerous investigations, with nicotine usage, hypercholesterolemia, arterial hypertension, and stenosis of the internal carotid artery being the most prevalent. In individuals with hypertensive arteriosclerosis, the occurrence of CRAO is more likely, but it can also occur in patients with endocarditis on rare occasions.

### Screening of moyamoya disease from retinal photographs: development and validation of deep learning algorithms [^111rQBRj]. Stroke (2024). Medium credibility.

Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a rare but well-known complex vaso-occlusive disease.MMD is characterized by an abnormally fine network of collateral circulation formed at the base of the brain due to progressive bilateral stenosis or occlusion in the main branches of the circle of Willis. – Decision-making for medical management is complicated due to the nature of its bilateral involvement and the narrowing of the distal internal carotid arteries (ICAs). – The progression pattern varies in both hemispheres, and predicting the natural course and progression of MMD is challenging. A sufficiently long follow-up period makes disease progression observable in most patients through symptoms or imaging studies, but diverse manifestations can be seen in the interim course. Factors determining the course and prognosis of MMD reported to date include the extent and speed of vascular occlusion, the extent of collateral circulation development, required blood flow, age of symptom onset, neurological abnormalities, and the presence of an infarct on imaging studies. Therefore, the determination of the natural course of MMD has been based on the balance between the extent of vascular occlusion and the effective collateral circulation developed at a particular time.

Due to these characteristics of MMD, the development of objective tools for its diagnosis and monitoring is essential. Conventional angiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is used for diagnosing MMD. For decision-making and proper management, clinical symptomatic follow-up and assessment of angiographic status are critical. However, the invasiveness and cost of both these imaging techniques limit their widespread feasibility. Retinal examination, involving the measurement of changes in several retinal vessels caused by the progression of MMD, may serve as an alternative diagnostic tool.MMD affects the region of the ICA where the ophthalmic artery bifurcates, potentially becoming a risk factor for retinal vessel abnormalities. Ethmoidal collaterals to the frontal lobe are common through the ophthalmic artery. As a result, it is often seen that the ophthalmic artery is enlarged and the retinal vascular filling is increased in digital subtraction angiography and MRA. Multiple ocular conditions, such as morning glory optic disc anomaly, chorioretinal coloboma, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, ocular ischemic syndrome, and retinal vascular occlusions, have all been associated with this disease. – Although these ophthalmic manifestations associated with MMD have sufficient diagnostic potential, they have not yet been adequately studied. This is due to the fact that minute changes are difficult to observe, while quantitative changes are difficult to measure.

### Paracentral acute middle maculopathy and the ischemic cascade: toward interventional management [^111DLZDa]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To present select cases of paracentral acute middle maculopathy (PAMM) demonstrating progressive vascular occlusion and the ischemic cascade and illustrate scenarios in which therapeutic intervention may be considered.

Design

Perspective.

Methods

Review and interpretation of selected literature, with perspective on the evaluation and management of patients with PAMM lesions. Multimodal imaging of 3 illustrative cases of PAMM are presented, including cross-sectional and en face optical coherence tomography (OCT), with progressive vascular occlusion and evidence of the ischemic cascade noted in 2 of the cases.

Results

All 3 cases showed evidence of PAMM at baseline, including perivenular PAMM in 2 cases. Progression from a mild central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) to a more severe CRVO was noted in the first case, while the second case progressed from an incomplete to complete central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). In the third case, there was resolution of PAMM lesions associated with partial CRAO after the patient began taking aspirin.

Conclusions

Perivenular PAMM can be the only presenting sign of retinal vascular occlusion. In such cases, it is important to differentiate between partial CRVO and incomplete CRAO as the underlying cause. We provide guidance on making this important distinction, which plays a critical role in directing the nature and urgency of the systemic work-up. In patients with PAMM caused by partial retinal arterial occlusion, a benign empirical approach, such as low-dose aspirin (81 mg), may be reasonable to reduce the likelihood of subsequent vision loss from progression to complete arterial occlusion. A clinical trial, however, is necessary to support such a strategy.

### New concepts on acute ocular ischemia [^111YRSBx]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review recent advances in the management of acute ocular ischemic events, including: transient monocular vision loss, central and branch retinal artery occlusions, and nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.

Recent Findings

Transient monocular vision loss and acute retinal arterial occlusions require immediate diagnosis and management, with recognition of these events as transient ischemic attack or stroke equivalents, respectively. Patients should undergo an immediate stroke workup in a stroke center, similar to patients with acute cerebral ischemia. The treatment of central retinal artery occlusions remains limited despite the growing use of thrombolytic treatments. The indication for these treatments remains under debate. No quality evidence exists to support any therapy, including corticosteroids, in the treatment of nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. The highest priority in management is to rule-out giant cell arteritis.

Summary

Effective therapies for the treatment of ischemic events of the retina and optic nerve remain elusive. Clinicians should focus on the prompt recognition of these events as ocular emergencies and immediately refer patients with vascular transient visual loss and acute central and branch retinal arterial occlusions to the nearest stroke center.

### Sequential bilateral retinal artery occlusion [^113YZL1c]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

An 86 year old woman experienced a sequential bilateral loss of vision over a period of less than 24 hours. Clinical findings and complementary studies suggested a bilateral atherogenic embolic event. Initially, she presented a superior branch retinal artery occlusion in her right eye followed by a central retinal artery occlusion with cilioretinal artery sparing in her left eye. Some conservative maneuvers performed did not improve visual acuity in the left eye. Supra-aortic Doppler ultrasonography revealed mild right internal carotid artery stenosis and moderate left internal carotid artery stenosis with a small, smooth, and homogeneous plaque. The transthoracic echocardiography showed a severe calcification of the mitral valve with a mild-moderate rim of stenosis. Central retinal artery occlusion and branch retinal artery occlusion are characterized by painless monocular loss of vision. Clinical approach and management attempt to treat the acute event, find the source of the vascular occlusion, and prevent further vascular events from occurring. Giant cell arteritis is a potentially treatable cause of central retinal artery occlusion and should be excluded in every single patient over 50 years old.

Prevention and early detection in branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) and RVO — there is a strong relationship between BRVO and systemic vascular disorders such as arterial hypertension and peripheral vascular disease, and older age and systemic vascular disorders are the strongest risk factors for RVO. A meta-analysis suggests that 48% of RVO is attributable to hypertension, 20% to hyperlipidemia, and 5% to diabetes. It is known that arteriovenous nicking, ocular perfusion pressure, and focal arteriolar narrowing are related to an increased risk of developing a BRVO. Data are inconclusive in determining whether lowering blood pressure and/or serum lipid levels improves visual acuity or the complications from RVO.

### Sequential bilateral retinal artery occlusion [^1123RjbE]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Sequential nonarteritic RAO occurring within a 24 hour period is an extremely rare condition. CRAO has a poor prognosis for spontaneous recovery of vision. Efforts to restore vision should begin emergently. Unfortunately, none of the proposed treatments has so far stood the test of time, in spite of enthusiastic claims. A beneficial effect is possible in acute RAO disorder if some of the aforementioned treatments are started aggressively much less than 4 hours from the onset. Prospective and randomized studies with an appropriate methodology are necessary in order to get conclusions concerning the efficacy of the different therapeutic options.

There are various types of acute RAO disorders. Understanding these classifications and pathogeneses is essential for full comprehension of the various aspects of these entities and their management. Since we now understand their pathogeneses, we should be better able to explore the management of the different clinical disorders individually rather than lumping diverse conditions into one group.

In persons aged 50 years and older, it is essential to rule out giant cell arteritis immediately, and if there is any suspicion of that, the patient should be immediately started on high-dose steroid therapy to prevent catastrophic visual loss. Diagnostic workup in CRAO and BRAO focuses on identifying the underlying etiology, in order to institute appropriate secondary prevention measures to reduce the risk of future vascular events.

### Natural history of branch retinal vein occlusion: an evidence-based systematic review [^112QhsWR]. Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the natural history of branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) based on the best available evidence from the literature.

Clinical Relevance

Branch retinal vein occlusion is the second most frequent major retinal vascular disease. Although several new treatments for BRVO are currently being introduced, data on its natural history are sparse.

Methods

English language articles were retrieved using a keyword search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Contents, and the Cochrane Library to November 13, 2008, supplemented by manually searching the references of review articles published within the last 5 years. All relevant observational studies evaluating the natural history of BRVO and all clinical trials evaluating BRVO interventions with an untreated control arm were independently identified by 2 investigators.

Results

Of a total of 5965 citations retrieved, 24 eligible studies were identified and reviewed, providing 1608 eyes with BRVO with data on natural history. Visual acuity (VA) was moderately poor at baseline (< 20/40). Although VA generally improved, with mean improvement ranging from 1 letter at 6 weeks to 28 letters up to 24 months, few studies reported improvement beyond 20/40. Over a 1-year period, 5% to 15% of eyes developed macular edema (ME), but of those with ME at baseline, 18% to 41% resolved. At baseline, 5% to 6% of eyes had bilateral BRVO, with 10% developing fellow eye involvement over time. There were few high-quality studies on other outcomes, including development of new vessels.

Conclusions

Visual acuity generally improved in eyes with BRVO without intervention, although clinically significant improvement beyond 20/40 was uncommon.

### Current treatment of central retinal artery occlusion: a national survey [^1115R1L4]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is an ophthalmological emergency, the retinal analog of a stroke. To date there is no consensus or national guidelines on how this disorder should be managed. As academic neurologists and ophthalmologists treat CRAO frequently, we set out to understand how these clinicians approach patients with CRAO with a national survey.

Methods

We identified university-associated teaching hospitals offering vascular neurology, neuro-ophthalmology and/or retina fellowships in the US and asked the directors of the programs to respond to questions in an open response format to profile the acute management of CRAO at their institution.

Results

We found remarkable heterogeneity in the approach to acute treatment of patients with CRAO among the 45 institutions that responded to the survey. Only 20% had a formal policy, guideline or white paper to standardize the approach to treatment. The primary treating physician was an ophthalmologist, neurologist, or neuro-ophthalmologist 44, 27, and 4% of the time, respectively; 24% were co-managed acutely by neurology and ophthalmology. Intravenous fibrinolysis was offered to selected patients in 53% of institutions, and was the preferred initial treatment in 36%. When the acute treatment team involved a vascular neurologist, fibrinolysis was more likely to be considered a first-line treatment (p < 0.05). Anterior chamber paracentesis, ocular massage and hyperbaric oxygen therapy were offered 42, 66 and 7% of the time, respectively, while 9% of institutions offered no treatment. Anterior chamber paracentesis was more likely to be offered at programs where neurologists were not involved in treating CRAOs (p < 0.001). At 35% of institutions, patients with acute CRAO were not routinely referred to a general emergency room for initial evaluation and treatment. Carotid imaging was routinely obtained by 89% of programs, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain by 69%, echocardiogram by 62%, laboratory screening for an inflammatory state by 27% and retinal angiography by 30%. The thoroughness of vascular risk factors' screening was greater in programs that routinely referred acute CRAO cases to the emergency department.

Conclusions

This survey shows that there is significant variability in treatment practices for acute CRAO in the US. Because of the high cerebrovascular and cardiovascular risk reported in this population of patients, it is notable that the approach to risk factor screening is also highly variable and many programs do not routinely refer patients to an emergency department for urgent evaluation. Finally, there appears to be equipoise among treatment teams regarding the efficacy of systemic fibrinolysis, as 53% of programs report a willingness to treat at least some patients with this modality.

### Update on the evaluation of transient vision loss [^11265WXS]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Transient vision loss may indicate underlying vascular disease, including carotid occlusion and thromboembolism, or it may have a more benign etiology, such as migraine or vasospasm. This review focuses on the differential diagnosis and workup of patients presenting with transient vision loss, focusing on several key areas: the relationship to thromboembolic vascular disease, hypercoagulable testing, retinal migraine, and bilateral vision loss. The objective is to provide the ophthalmologist with information on how to best manage these patients. Thromboembolic etiologies for transient vision loss are sometimes managed with medications, but when carotid surgery is indicated, earlier intervention may prevent future stroke. This need for early treatment places the ophthalmologist in the important role of expediting the management process. Hospital admission is recommended in patients presenting with transient symptoms within 72 hours who meet certain high-risk criteria. When the cause is giant cell arteritis, ocular ischemic syndrome, or a cardioembolic source, early management of the underlying condition is equally important. For nonthromboembolic causes of transient vision loss such as retinal migraine or retinal vasospasm, the ophthalmologist can provide reassurance as well as potentially give medications to decrease the frequency of vision loss episodes.

Future considerations

These recommendations are likely to be updated as additional long-term data on the treatment of visual impairment caused by macular oedema secondary to RVO with ranibizumab become available. Endeavours to optimise therapeutic outcomes in patients with RVO while decreasing treatment burden and improving QoL are desirable, and increased clinical experience will ultimately allow physicians to make the best choices for their patients.

Provider and setting — Although the ophthalmologist will perform the examination and any associated surgery, certain aspects of data collection may be performed by trained individuals under the ophthalmologist's supervision and review, and because of the complexities of the diagnosis and treatment for RVO, the ophthalmologist caring for patients with these conditions should be familiar with the specific recommendations of relevant clinical trials. The American Academy of Ophthalmology has a stated position and a policy statement on the role of the ophthalmologist in the delivery of intravitreal agents.

### The burden of disease of retinal vein occlusion: review of the literature [^114TYKgv]. Eye (2011). Low credibility.

Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is the second most common cause of vision loss due to retinal vascular disease. A literature review was undertaken to understand the epidemiology, clinical consequence, current practice patterns, and cost of RVO. Pertinent articles were identified by computerized searches of the English language literature in MEDLINE supplemented with electronic and manual searches of society/association proceedings and bibliographies of electronically identified sources. Population-based studies report a prevalence rate of 0.5–2.0% for branch RVO and 0.1–0.2% for central RVO. The 15-year incidence rate is estimated to be 1.8% for branch RVO and 0.2% for central RVO. Patients with RVO report lower vision-related quality of life than those without ocular disease. Available treatment options are limited. Until recently there was no treatment for central RVO. Laser photocoagulation is only recommended for branch RVO in patients who have not experienced severe vision loss. Emerging evidence on the effectiveness of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy and dexamethasone intravitreal implant is promising. Information on the treatment patterns and cost of RVO is extremely limited with one retrospective analysis of secondary insurance payment data identified and limited to the United States population only. A better understanding of the economic and societal impact of RVO will help decision makers evaluate emerging medical interventions for this sight-threatening disease.

### Associations of retinal artery occlusion and retinal vein occlusion to mortality, stroke, and myocardial infarction: a systematic review [^1126PkgV]. Eye (2016). Low credibility.

Retinal vascular events are perceived to be related to various cardiovascular complications. We conducted a systematic review to assess the relationship between retinal artery/vein occlusions (RAO/RVO) and the incidence of mortality, stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI). A comprehensive electronic literature search selected 93 relevant studies between 1992–2015: 16 articles qualified for inclusion (7 for mortality rate and MI, 11 for stroke). No published articles examined associations of RAO to mortality or MI, but only to stroke. Because of the heterogeneity of studies, no meta-analysis was performed. The association with mortality risk was highest at ~34.7% in RVO subgroup; whereas for MI, the risk was comparatively lower at 3.9–5.7% for RVO. There was no significant difference in stroke rate when comparing central and branch RVO subgroups (6.5%), but was significantly higher at 19.6–25% in RAO. There is a positive association of retinal vascular events to mortality, stroke, and MI. RAO is associated with a higher risk of stroke. Given that RAO and RVO patients would generally present to ophthalmologists, their high cardiovascular risk should include a referral for cardiovascular assessment as part of their management protocol.

### Foveal thickness fluctuations in anti-VEGF treatment for central retinal vein occlusion [^114Wu9i6]. Ophthalmology Science (2023). Medium credibility.

Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is a common retinal vascular disorder with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 1000. Macular edema (ME) is a major complication of CRVO, and it can decrease the visual acuity (VA) of the affected eye. In addition to ME, retinal ischemia and subsequent neovascular complications, namely vitreous hemorrhage (VH) and neovascular glaucoma (NVG), can lead to legal blindness in patients with CRVO. However, intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents have improved the visual and anatomical outcomes of patients with CRVO-ME. These improvements have been observed in both the short and long terms, with a significant improvement in the visual prognosis relative to that before anti-VEGF therapy.

Additional injections of anti-VEGF agents based on a pro re nata (PRN) protocol is considered the clinical management strategy for recurrent CRVO-ME; the usefulness of this protocol has been validated in several clinical trials. Central retinal vein occlusion-ME shows wide variations in each patient; therefore, a fixed dosing protocol cannot always be applied. A PRN regimen helps in the management of such cases.

In previous studies of eyes receiving anti-VEGF therapies based on PRN protocols for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO), eyes with greater foveal thickness (FT) fluctuation (FTF) showed poorer final VA values and more severe foveal damage than those with smaller fluctuations. Compared to eyes with BRVO, eyes with CRVO tend to have larger retinal nonperfusion areas that occasionally involve the macula, and they produce more intraocular VEGF. Retinal nonperfusion areas involving the macula are likely to resolve ME in eyes with CRVO. The effects of FTF on the visual and morphological outcomes of eyes receiving anti-VEGF therapy for CRVO-ME remain unclear. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to explore the effects of FTF on the VA, development of neovascular complications, and morphological outcomes in eyes with CRVO receiving long-term anti-VEGF treatment based on a PRN protocol for recurrent ME.

### Risk of retinal vascular occlusive disease in patients with aortic stenosis: a nationwide Korean cohort study [^111XSWWf]. Ophthalmology Science (2025). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is a condition where the aortic valve narrows, restricting blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta. Its prevalence is rising in the aging population and is associated with significant mortality. Therefore, AS is increasingly recognized as an important medical condition today. The pathogenesis of AS is multifactorial, including calcification and fibrosis of the aortic valve leaflets, as well as several conditions linked to vascular diseases, such as endothelial damage, inflammation of the vessel, and atherosclerosis.

Retinal vascular occlusive diseases (RVODs) include 2 main conditions: retinal artery occlusion (RAO) and retinal vein occlusion (RVO). Retinal artery occlusion is primarily caused by an embolus that can originate from atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid arteries or cardiac sources such as valvular heart diseases and arrhythmia. Retinal vein occlusion is commonly associated with systemic conditions that affect the vascular endothelium and blood flow dynamics, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. Both conditions can cause subsequent retinal hemorrhages, edema, and ischemia, which can lead to irreversible vision loss if not treated promptly. Therefore, the development and management of RVOD is considered very important in the field of ophthalmology.

It has been reported that RVOD is significantly associated with cardiovascular diseases. Retinal vascular abnormalities are predictors of cardiovascular conditions such as coronary artery disease and heart failure. In addition, RVOD has significant associations with atrial fibrillation (AF) and myocardial infarction (MI). Although there is limited research on RVOD risk in patients with valvular heart disease, RAO and RVO share common pathophysiological pathways with AS, particularly through systemic atherosclerosis or vascular injury caused by inflammation and oxidative stress. The intersection of AS and RVOD underscores the need for comprehensive cardiovascular and ophthalmic evaluations in patients with either condition. Thus, we aimed to investigate the actual prevalence and risk of RVOD in patients with AS and to propose the shared mechanisms between the 2 conditions to provide targeted prevention and management strategies for treating these diseases.

### Ranibizumab for the treatment of degenerative ocular conditions [^116HM25q]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Retinal vein occlusion

Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is the second most commonly occurring retinal vascular abnormality after diabetic retinopathy and is a significant cause of vision loss. The pathogenesis includes occlusion of veins by vascular clot, external compression, or damage to the vessel wall. Occlusion can occur either in the central retinal vein (central RVO [CRVO]) or branches of the retinal veins (branch RVO [BRVO]) and prognosis varies depending on which is occluded.VEGF plays an important role in the pathogenesis of ME in both CRVO and BRVO as they both lead to fluid leakage from capillaries, caused by the secretion of VEGF, and result in edema.

The clinical presentation of patients with BRVO is less severe than that seen in patients with CRVO, because venous return is compromised in approximately less than half of the retina, rather than the entire retina. The major cause of visual loss in patients with RVO is ME, and nonperfusion of perifoveal capillaries also contributes to this. To date, grid or focal laser photocoagulation have been shown to reduce the visual loss and even improve VA; however, there have been limitations to this treatment.

Recently, anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic therapeutic strategies have been used to target vascular permeability and leakage to reduce ME and improve vision. Corticosteroids (triamcinolone acetonide and dexamethasone) have shown potential to reduce edema in RVO. However, their side effects, such as cataract progression and elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) have limited their use.

Consequently, treatment with anti-VEGF has been used successfully to treat ME and as elevated intraocular levels of VEGF have been demonstrated in patients with RVOs, anti-VEGF agents have been strongly suggested to be beneficial.

### Retina summary benchmarks – 2024 [^116MeA4C]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Retinal vein occlusions (patient follow-up) — follow-up evaluation includes history of changes in symptoms and systemic status and examination elements such as visual acuity, undilated slit-lamp biomicroscopy and gonioscopy, performed monthly for 6 months with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) and in ischemic CRVO after discontinuing anti-VEGF to detect neovascularization, along with pupillary assessment for a relative afferent pupillary defect, measurement of intraocular pressure, stereoscopic posterior pole exam after dilation, OCT imaging, peripheral retina and vitreous exam when indicated, and fluorescein angiography. Ophthalmologists should refer patients with an RVO to a primary care physician for appropriate management and communicate results to the physician managing ongoing care, risk to the fellow eye should be communicated to both the primary care provider and the patient, and patients whose condition fails to respond to therapy and when further treatment is unavailable should be provided with professional support and offered referral for counseling, vision rehabilitation, or social services as appropriate.

### Ranibizumab in retinal vein occlusion: treatment recommendations by an expert panel [^115U81Rk]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is a common cause of retinal vascular disease, resulting in potentially irreversible loss of vision despite the existence of several therapeutic options. The humanised monoclonal antibody fragment ranibizumab binds to and inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor, a key driver of macular oedema in RVO. In 2010, ranibizumab was approved in the United States for the treatment of macular oedema in RVO and, in 2011, ranibizumab was approved in the European Union for the treatment of visual impairment caused by macular oedema secondary to RVO in branch and central RVO. Ranibizumab provides an additional therapeutic option for this complex disease: an option that was not fully considered during the preparation of current international guidelines. An expert panel was convened to critically evaluate the evidence for treatment with ranibizumab in patients with visual impairment caused by macular oedema secondary to RVO and to develop treatment recommendations, with the aim of assisting physicians to optimise patient treatment.

### Clinical characteristics and natural history of branch retinal artery ischemia [^113hunJP]. Ophthalmology Science (2025). Medium credibility.

Retinal vascular events present with a myriad of clinical manifestations depending on the location, acuity, and severity of the event. Sudden, total obstruction of retinal arteries causes acute retinal ischemia and leads to branch or central retinal artery occlusion (BRAO or CRAO). These retinal artery occlusions may cause sudden vision loss accompanied by whitened, opacified retinal edema, "boxcarring" of blood vessels, and attenuation of the retinal arteries on fundus examination, with progressive retinal thinning over time. Central retinal artery occlusion is considered to be a stroke equivalent. Although practice patterns vary by geography, thrombolysis may be effective in visual recovery if administered within the stroke window. Risk factors for CRAO and BRAO include factors that contribute to atherosclerosis and elevated intraocular pressure, such as arterial hypertension, ischemic cardiac disease, peripheral artery disease, history of stroke, renal disease, cataract, and glaucoma.

Chronic hypoperfusion of the retina may also occur as a result of carotid artery stenosis, leading to ocular ischemic syndrome (OIS). Ocular ischemic syndrome is characterized by retinal arterial narrowing and mid-peripheral round retinal hemorrhages on fundus examination and delayed arterial filling on fluorescein angiography (FA). The degree of vision loss is variable and typically gradual. Chronic ischemia due to OIS can also result in complications such as retinal neovascularization and neovascular glaucoma, which may result in permanent vision loss or even loss of the eye.

Unlike BRAO or OIS, branch retinal artery ischemia (BRAI) was first described by Yiu and Mukkamala in 2018 as a chronic, sectoral hypoperfusion state caused by a partially occlusive Hollenhorst plaque. This uncommon clinical presentation is characterized by the presence of a retinal arterial plaque accompanied by sectoral round retinal hemorrhages and delayed arterial filling in the vascular distribution distal to the plaque. Unlike OIS, the retinal hemorrhages in BRAI are only present in a sectoral distribution along the affected retinal artery. The hemorrhages are small and round, unlike the flame-shaped hemorrhages that more often occur in retinal vein occlusions (RVOs). In contrast to retinal artery occlusions, there is no retinal whitening or progressive thinning. Similar phenomena such as "partial" or "incomplete" BRAO have been reported, which may lead to paracentral acute middle maculopathy. Here, we performed a cohort study of patients diagnosed with BRAI to better characterize its natural history and conducted a systematic image review of patients diagnosed with related retinal vascular conditions to estimate the prevalence of this clinical entity.

### Central retinal vascular occlusion associated with acute retinal necrosis… [^116nycZt]. JAMA Network (2012). Excellent credibility.

The results of an ophthalmic examination of the right eye were unremarkable. Fluorescein angiography showed extremely delayed arterial perfusion OS and absent venous filling during the recirculation phase, consistent with a combined central retinal artery occlusion and central retinal vein occlusion. A subsequent cardiac workup showed severe coronary artery disease with near-complete occlusion of the left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries. The patient subsequently underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with stent and aggressive hypertension and hyperlipidemia treatment. At 9-month follow-up, visual acuities were 20/25 OD and no light perception OS. Treatment with oral valacyclovir 3 times a day was initiated, and serial intravitreal foscarnet injections were administered every 3 days for a total of 4 injections. Visual acuity declined to light perception, secondary to worsening vitreous hemorrhage.

Two areas of focal traction retinal detachment were identified by using B-scan ultrasonography, prompting a pars plana vitrectomy, membrane peel, endolaser, and silicone oil instillation. Optic nerve pallor, severely attenuated retinal arterioles, and peripheral neovascularization were observed intraoperatively. Following pars plana vitrectomy, membrane peel, endolaser, and silicone oil instillation for a vitreous hemorrhage and tractional retinal detachment, a fundus photograph showed extremely sclerotic retinal arterioles and optic nerve pallor. Fluorescein angiographic images show a global delay in arterial perfusion with arterial filling at 21 seconds and delayed venous filling, which was consistent with a central retinal artery occlusion. Three weeks later, the patient was referred for an evaluation. Visual acuity was counting fingers at 3 ft OD and 20/25 OS.

Slitlamp examination showed granulomatous keratic precipitates, 1+ anterior chamber cell/flare, and 1+ vitreous cell. Dilated funduscopic examination showed optic nerve pallor and severe retinal arteriolar attenuation. Inferotemporally, there was approximately 2 to 3 clock hours of retinal necrosis. The findings from a fluorescein angiography confirmed poor arterial perfusion consistent with a CRAO.

### Disorganization of retinal inner layers and visual acuity and retinal vein occlusion treatment response… [^116fpxGi]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Absence of DRIL at baseline in the CRVO/HRVO group correlated with greater VA gains at 6 months, adjusting for baseline VA. During 12 months, continued DRIL presence in BRVO was associated with less VA gain up to 6 months. Retinal vein occlusion is the second most common form of retinal vascular disease; obstructions can occur in the central retinal vein or one of its branches. 1 As vascular permeability increases, secondary intraretinal fluid and subretinal fluid commonly accumulate in the outer plexiform layer and subretinal space, respectively, and can lead to long-term disorganization of the ellipsoid zone. 2 These findings, along with other complications such as macular ischemia and neovascularization, threaten visual acuity. The mean number of injections was 5. 2 in the BRVO group and
5. 1 in the CRVO/HRVO group. The number of injections given shows a significant decrease in treatment from months 6 to 12 compared with months 0 to 6 in both groups. Among those patients with DRIL at baseline who had no change in their DRIL score or who saw an increase in their DRIL score at 6 months, those in the BRVO group had a higher baseline VA than those in the CRVO/HRVO group and were more likely to reach a VA of 20/32 at month 6 than those in the CRVO/HRVO group. In the CRVO/HRVO group, those without DRIL had significantly greater increases in ETDRS scores at 6 months after adjusting for differences in baseline ETDRS scores.

This difference was also apparent in the CRVO/HRVO group after adjusting for baseline VA and changes in CST when evaluating the association between DRIL score change at 6 and 12 months and ETDRS score changes at 6 and 12 months.

### Branch retinal vein occlusion… [^114v7LnJ]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

Best-corrected VA and visual field outcome on follow-up. Results The median time to macular edema resolution was 21 months in those with major BRVO and 18 months in those with macular BRVO. Overall, for eyes with initial VA of 20/60 or better, VA improved or remained stable in 75% for major BRVO and 86% for macular BRVO. In those with initial VA of 20/70 or worse, VA improved in 69% for major BRVO and in 53% for macular BRVO, with median final VA of 20/60 for both BRVO types. Rogers et al20 reviewed the natural history of visual outcome in BRVO in articles published in English up to 2010 and concluded that VA generally improved in eyes with BRVO without intervention, although clinically significant improvement beyond 20/40 was uncommon. Branch retinal vein occlusion actually consists of 2 distinct clinical entities: major BRVO and macular BRVO.

21, 22 Therefore, we investigated separately for major and macular BRVO the natural history of visual outcome in 216 consecutive untreated eyes that fulfilled our inclusion and exclusion criteria. For macular BRVO with initial VA of 20/70 or worse, median VA after macular edema resolved was 20/70, and VA improved in 7 of 12 eyes. There were only 3 macular BRVO eyes with initial VA of 20/70 or worse where macular edema did not resolve, of which all had VA of 20/40 at last follow-up. Quiz Ref IDThis study showed that VA improved in the majority of eyes with both major and macular BRVO without any treatment. After macular edema resolved, VA had improved in 76% of eyes with major BRVO and 58% of eyes with macular BRVO, and it was worse in 9% and 42%, respectively; this shows that eyes with macular BRVO do not improve to the same extent as those with major BRVO.

### Ocular neovascularization with retinal vascular occlusion… [^113GchhX]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

- Experimental occlusion of both major temporal retinal veins simultaneously and of the central retinal vein produced a fall in intraocular pressure and neovascularization of the iris and, less frequently, of the optic disc. The retinal changes were correlated with the pattern of ocular NV and hypotony. No direct correlation was seen between the retinal capillary obliteration and the hypotensive or vasogenic effect. However, a correlation was found between the retinal vascular leakage and the development of ocular NV and hypotony. The pathogeneses of ocular NV and hypotony in retinal vein occlusion are discussed in light of the findings of this study. Virdi PS, Hayreh SS.
