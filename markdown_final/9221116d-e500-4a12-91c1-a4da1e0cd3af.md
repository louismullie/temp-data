## Question

Differential for hypoprotienemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis and workup of hypoproteinemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining hypoproteinemia and its clinical significance. Then, I should organize the differential by pathophysiology. Next, I will prioritize the most common etiologies and outline a practical diagnostic algorithm. After that, I need to detail disease-specific pathways for protein-losing enteropathy, nephrotic syndrome, liver disease, and malnutrition/inflammation. Finally, I should consider special populations, pitfalls, and a concise decision framework with key tests and red flags, making sure I verify each step against the cited literature as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and why it matters clinically. Hypoproteinemia refers to a reduction in total serum protein, most often driven by hypoalbuminemia, which lowers plasma oncotic pressure and contributes to edema; it is also a strong, dose-dependent predictor of adverse outcomes in acutely ill patients, so I need to ensure I do not dismiss it as merely a nutritional marker without investigating the cause [^117GN3gT] [^111Nt5EN] [^111tew52].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should organize the differential by mechanism to avoid missing mixed etiologies. The four principal buckets are decreased synthesis (e.g., liver failure), increased losses (renal, gastrointestinal, third-space sequestration), malnutrition with or without inflammation, and distributional or kinetic shifts that alter albumin distribution or half-life; I will keep these in mind as I proceed and double-check that each proposed diagnosis fits one of these buckets [^113Ef2F4] [^116qY5AU].

> I will now examine decreased synthesis, starting with liver disease. Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology: in cirrhosis, albumin synthesis falls as hepatocyte mass and function decline, and portal hypertension further worsens oncotic imbalance; in acute liver failure, synthesis can drop rapidly, so I should check liver enzymes, INR, and clinical stigmata of chronic liver disease when hypoalbuminemia is present [^113Ef2F4].

> Next, I should review increased losses via the kidney. Nephrotic syndrome causes massive urinary protein loss with hypoalbuminemia and edema; I need to check a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio or 24-hour urine protein and confirm the pattern of selective albumin loss, keeping in mind that congenital or genetic forms can present in infancy and that early-onset disease warrants genetic evaluation in pediatrics [^114CfHPA].

> Now, gastrointestinal protein loss. Protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) spans erosive and nonerosive mucosal disease, lymphatic disorders, and increased permeability states; I should confirm with fecal alpha-1 antitrypsin clearance when other causes are excluded, and then pursue endoscopy, imaging, and targeted testing for IBD, celiac disease, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, lymphangiectasia, right-sided heart failure or constrictive pericarditis, and systemic diseases like SLE or CHAPLE, which can all drive PLE and secondary hypogammaglobulinemia [^1132uRoR] [^113PTirg] [^113gExhK].

> Let me consider third-space sequestration and capillary leak. Post-cardiac injury syndrome and other inflammatory effusive states can trap protein-rich fluid in pleural or pericardial spaces, producing functional hypoproteinemia; I should compare effusion protein with serum protein and look for a similar concentration to support this mechanism, especially when edema is disproportionate to albumin level [^113wGTGe].

> I need to check malnutrition and inflammation next. Uncomplicated starvation alone rarely lowers albumin substantially; hypoalbuminemia in illness largely reflects disease-related inflammation with cytokine-mediated capillary leak, hemodilution, and altered kinetics, so I should correlate with CRP and the clinical context and avoid using albumin as a standalone nutrition marker; frameworks like GLIM and ASPEN emphasize phenotypic and etiologic criteria rather than albumin alone for malnutrition diagnosis [^1122vAjE] [^114uBeWh] [^116qY5AU].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child or pregnant? In pediatrics, congenital nephrotic syndrome, cystic fibrosis with protein-calorie malnutrition, and VEO-IBD with PLE are key considerations; in pregnancy, physiologic hemodilution lowers albumin modestly, but marked hypoalbuminemia should still trigger evaluation for preeclampsia, HELLP, or other pathologic causes rather than attributing it to pregnancy alone [^114CfHPA] [^112XeSoK].

> Next, I should review a pragmatic diagnostic algorithm. First, confirm true hypoalbuminemia and exclude pseudohypoalbuminemia or lab artifact; then triage by history, exam, and basic labs into liver disease, renal protein loss, GI protein loss, or malnutrition/inflammation; next, order targeted tests such as urine protein quantification, liver panel and INR, and fecal A1AT clearance; finally, pursue endoscopy, imaging, or specialized testing based on initial results, and escalate to genetic testing in early-onset or refractory cases [^1132uRoR] [^113PTirg] [^114CfHPA].

> For PLE specifically, I should double-check the sequence. Start with fecal alpha-1 antitrypsin clearance; if elevated, proceed to upper and lower endoscopy with biopsies for IBD, celiac disease, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, and lymphangiectasia; obtain echocardiography and consider CT or MR lymphangiography if lymphatic disorders are suspected; and keep systemic diseases like SLE and CHAPLE on the radar, including complement and immunologic testing when indicated [^1132uRoR] [^113PTirg] [^113gExhK].

> For nephrotic syndrome, I should confirm heavy proteinuria and then differentiate steroid-sensitive from steroid-resistant disease; in children, steroid resistance or atypical features should prompt genetic testing, and management of hypovolemia may require cautious albumin infusion in select scenarios, so I need to ensure I follow pediatric nephrology guidance rather than extrapolating adult protocols [^111NbgfE] [^114CfHPA].

> For liver disease, I should verify synthetic function with albumin and INR and assess for portal hypertension and ascites; if ascites is present, I need to calculate the serum-ascites albumin gradient and evaluate for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and other complications per AASLD guidance, recognizing that hypoalbuminemia both reflects severity and worsens fluid retention [^117WEX5C].

> For malnutrition with inflammation, I should confirm reduced intake or assimilation and disease burden using validated criteria, and I must remember that albumin and prealbumin are confounded by inflammation; instead, I should integrate weight loss, BMI, muscle mass, and inflammatory markers to guide nutrition support decisions and avoid overinterpreting albumin alone [^1122vAjE] [^114uBeWh].

> I should also flag red flags that demand urgent action. Severe hypoalbuminemia with shock or respiratory compromise may require albumin and critical care support; marked proteinuria suggests nephrotic syndrome and risks of thrombosis and infection; and PLE with secondary hypogammaglobulinemia increases infection risk and may warrant immunoglobulin replacement in select cases after standard prophylaxis fails, though evidence is limited and decisions should be individualized [^111NbgfE] [^113aHFWq].

> Let me reconsider the key tests I cannot miss. Urine protein quantification, liver panel with INR, and fecal alpha-1 antitrypsin clearance are the highest-yield first-line discriminators; add endoscopy, echocardiography, and complement or immunologic testing when PLE is suspected; and use genetic testing early for congenital nephrotic syndrome, VEO-IBD, or other monogenic etiologies, especially in pediatrics [^1132uRoR] [^113aHFWq] [^114CfHPA].

> Finally, I should synthesize a concise decision framework. If urine protein is high, think nephrotic syndrome; if liver tests and INR indicate synthetic dysfunction, think liver disease; if fecal A1AT clearance is high, think PLE and pursue GI and lymphatic evaluations; if all of these are unrevealing, reassess for malnutrition with inflammation, third-space sequestration, or rare genetic or systemic diseases, and avoid anchoring on a single mechanism when mixed etiologies are plausible [^1132uRoR] [^113Ef2F4] [^111tew52].

Hypoproteinemia is defined as **low total serum protein**, most often due to **low albumin** [^notfound]. The key causes are **decreased synthesis** (liver disease, malnutrition) [^1132uRoR], **increased losses** (nephrotic syndrome, protein-losing enteropathy) [^1132uRoR], and **dilutional states** (volume overload, pregnancy) [^1133SmBJ]. A structured approach — history, exam, and targeted labs — is essential to distinguish these mechanisms and guide management [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Hypoproteinemia arises from **three main mechanisms**:

| **Mechanism** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Decreased synthesis | - Liver cirrhosis <br/> - Hepatitis <br/> - Malnutrition <br/> - Protein-energy malnutrition [^1133SmBJ] |
| Increased losses | - Nephrotic syndrome <br/> - Protein-losing enteropathy <br/> - Burns <br/> - Exudative wounds [^1132uRoR] [^1133SmBJ] |
| Dilutional states | - Volume overload <br/> - Pregnancy <br/> - Excessive IV fluids [^1133SmBJ] |

---

## Clinical manifestations

Hypoproteinemia presents with:

- **Edema**: Peripheral, facial, or generalized [^112VU6Aw].
- **Ascites and pleural effusions**: From reduced oncotic pressure [^112c9s79].
- **Fatigue and weakness**: Due to reduced transport and buffering [^notfound].
- **Infection risk**: From impaired immunity and complement [^113aHFWq].
- **Coagulopathy**: Loss of clotting factors and transport proteins [^114sjeop].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured approach** is essential:

- **History and physical examination**: Diet, liver disease, renal disease, GI symptoms, edema, ascites [^111tew52].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, liver function tests, renal function tests, serum albumin, total protein, urine protein, stool alpha-1 antitrypsin [^1132uRoR].
- **Imaging**: Ultrasound, CT, or MRI for liver, kidney, or GI disease [^111v7Qor].
- **Specialized tests**: Hepatitis serology, autoimmune panels, genetic testing, endoscopy [^112dRyHE].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **differential diagnosis** includes:

| **Category** | **Conditions** |
|-|-|
| Liver disease | - Cirrhosis <br/> - Hepatitis <br/> - Hepatic failure [^113Ef2F4] |
| Renal disease | - Nephrotic syndrome <br/> - Chronic kidney disease [^notfound] |
| Gastrointestinal disease | - Protein-losing enteropathy <br/> - Celiac disease <br/> - Inflammatory bowel disease <br/> - Ménétrier disease [^1133SmBJ] [^116MEEdp] |
| Nutritional deficiency | - Malnutrition <br/> - Protein-energy malnutrition <br/> - Kwashiorkor [^116vB5V9] |
| Inflammatory conditions | - Systemic lupus erythematosus <br/> - Rheumatoid arthritis <br/> - Chronic infections [^116vB5V9] |
| Genetic disorders | - Familial hypercatabolic hypoproteinemia <br/> - Congenital analbuminemia [^notfound] |
| Dilutional states | - Volume overload <br/> - Pregnancy <br/> - Excessive IV fluids [^notfound] |

---

## Management strategies

Management targets the **underlying cause**:

- **Liver disease**: Treat cirrhosis or hepatitis; consider liver transplantation [^notfound].
- **Renal disease**: Manage nephrotic syndrome; immunosuppression, dialysis, or transplantation [^111NbgfE].
- **Gastrointestinal disease**: Treat IBD, celiac disease, or protein-losing enteropathy; dietary changes, surgery, or immunosuppression [^1132uRoR].
- **Nutritional deficiency**: Nutritional support, dietary protein, and supplementation [^notfound].
- **Dilutional states**: Fluid management and correction of volume status [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the **cause, severity, and response**. Severe hypoalbuminemia is linked to higher morbidity and mortality, especially in critical illness [^111Nt5EN]. Outcomes improve with timely, targeted therapy and nutritional support [^115uhAZf].

---

Hypoproteinemia reflects reduced synthesis, increased losses, or dilution; a focused history, exam, and labs are key to identifying the cause and guiding therapy.

### Approach to patients with hypophosphataemia [^117LCpxS]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

Phosphate metabolism is an evolving area of basic and clinical research. In the past 15 years, knowledge on disturbances of phosphate homoeostasis has expanded, as has the discovery of new targeted therapies. Hypophosphataemia might be the biochemical finding in several diseases, and its clinical evaluation should initially focus on the assessment of pathophysiological mechanisms leading to low serum phosphate concentrations. Clinical consequences of hypophosphataemia can involve multiple organ systems and vary depending on several factors, the most important being the underlying disorder. This Review focuses on the approach to patients with hypophosphataemia and how underlying pathophysiological mechanisms should be understood in the evaluation of differential diagnosis. We define an algorithm for the assessment of hypophosphataemia and review the most up-to-date literature on specific therapies. Continuous research in this area will result in a better understanding and management of patients with hypophosphataemia.

### Protein-losing enteropathy: case illustrations and clinical review [^1132uRoR]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) is a rare syndrome of gastrointestinal protein loss that may complicate a variety of diseases. The primary causes can be divided into erosive gastrointestinal disorders, nonerosive gastrointestinal disorders, and disorders involving increased central venous pressure or mesenteric lymphatic obstruction. The diagnosis of PLE should be considered in patients with hypoproteinemia after other causes, such as malnutrition, proteinuria, and impaired protein synthesis due to cirrhosis, have been excluded. The diagnosis of PLE is most commonly based on the determination of fecal alpha-1 antitrypsin clearance. Treatment of PLE targets the underlying disease but also includes dietary modification, supportive care, and maintenance of nutritional status. In this article, cases illustrating a variety of clinical presentations and etiologies of PLE are presented, and its diagnostic approach and treatment are reviewed.

### Doll-like face: is it an underestimated clinical presentation of cystic fibrosis? [^112XeSoK]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2008). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most prevalant inheritable chronic disease in caucasian children. The clinical syndrome of kwashiorkor is well-recognized complication of CF. The edema of the face can be seen in kwashiorkor. As doll-like face is very rare and underestimated clinical presentation of CF patients complicated with hypoproteinemia we evaluated demographic features and laboratory characteristics of 5 patients diagnosed as CF with doll-like face.

Methods

Between June 2005 and January 2008, 115 children were diagnosed as having CF enrolled in our center. Five infants were diagnosed as CF with doll-like face before the age of 6 months participitated in study.

Results

The incidence of doll-like face younger than the 6 months of age were 9.4% in our center. 48 infants diagnosed as CF without doll-like face before the age of 6 months participitated in the study as controls (group2). Physical examination revealed doll-like face and pitting edema of lower extremities in group 1. Their weight and length were under the third centile. Laboratory findings of group 1 include: mean hemoglobin 7.6g/dl; mean total protein 4.4 g/dl; albumin 2.3 g/dl. When compared control group in order to; 11.4 g/dl (range 7.6–17.9); 6.2 g/dl (range 4.0–8.8); 4.7 g/dl (range 2.1–5.8). mean hemoglobin, total protein and albumin values were lower in group 1.

Conclusion

In a subgroup of patients, doll-like face may be the presenting manifestation of CF. Especially in developing countries clinicians should be aware of in patients with malnutrition and doll-like face and CF should be considered in differential diagnosis.

### A case report of intestinal obstruction caused by cryptogenic multifocal ulcerous stenosing enteritis [^113SYN1g]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Main treatment methods includes: (1) Hormones: Glucocorticoids are presently the first line of treatment, but these are likely to cause hormone dependence, relapse, and steroid resistance. (2) Endoscopic balloon dilatation: This can alleviate the symptoms, and prevent small bowel resection. (3) Surgery: This can easily relapse after surgery, and repeated surgery can easily cause complications, such as short bowel syndrome. (4) Nutritional support therapy: Enteral or parenteral nutrition and iron supplementation can improve the symptoms in the short term, and even obtain mucosal healing. However, since the patient resumed eating, the mucosal ulcer, anemia and hypoproteinemia rapidly relapsed.

CMUSE is a rare disease of unknown etiology. Multiple superficial ulcers and intestinal stenosis in the small intestine are its typical manifestations. Its diagnosis depends on the comprehensive judgment of clinical manifestations, imaging examinations, endoscopy and pathological examinations. The investigators will continue to follow the patient and monitor for its recurrence. The present study aims to remind clinicians of this disease. When encountering similar lesions, the possibility of this disease must be considered. This also provides a differential diagnosis for small bowel ulcers and stenotic diseases, reducing the occurrence of misdiagnosis.

### Malnutrition syndromes: a conundrum vs continuum [^113Pqmr9]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

This provocative commentary critically examines historic definitions for adult malnutrition syndromes as they apply to developed countries with modern healthcare. To stimulate further discussion, the authors propose an updated approach that incorporates current understanding of the systemic inflammatory response to help guide assessment, diagnosis, and treatment. An appreciation of a continuum of inflammatory response in relation to malnutrition syndromes is described. This discussion serves to highlight a research agenda to address deficiencies in diagnostics, biomarkers, and therapeutics of inflammation in relation to malnutrition.

### Differential diagnosis of perinatal hypophosphatasia: radiologic perspectives [^116FUg9W]. Pediatric Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

HPP is confirmed with consistently low age- and gender-adjusted alkaline phosphatase activity in conjunction with medical history and physical findings, radiologic findings, elevated levels of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase substrates or sequencing of the ALPL gene. In utero and postnatal recognition and diagnosis of perinatal HPP based on radiologic findings can be challenging because of features that overlap with many of the more than 400 other skeletal dysplasias, the phenotypic variability and a lack of information about the in utero natural history of HPP. The skeletal abnormalities and the gestational and postnatal ages at which they manifest vary across skeletal dysplasias, including HPP. Many sonographic and radiographic findings are not pathognomonic for a specific disorder, as obtaining reliable information regarding skeletal mineralization is difficult with prenatal sonography and computed tomography (CT). These difficulties are confounded by a general lack of familiarity with HPP among the health care providers who perform prenatal ultrasound (US) and neonatal imaging. In addition, abnormalities can be detected at earlier gestational ages than they have in the past, underscoring the need for obstetricians, ultrasonographers and radiologists to possess in-depth knowledge of the appearance of the fetal skeleton at all gestational ages. This review focuses on the role of fetal and neonatal imaging modalities in the differential diagnosis of perinatal HPP.

### AGA clinical practice update on the epidemiology, evaluation, and management of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency: expert review [^111z25Sj]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — Best Practice Advice 3 — clinical features and differential diagnosis of EPI states that clinical features of EPI include steatorrhea with or without diarrhea, weight loss, bloating, excessive flatulence, fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies, and protein-calorie malnutrition. The differential diagnosis for EPI is broad and multiple disorders may be present in the same patient, making diagnosis challenging, EPI-specific patient-reported outcome measures have been developed but cannot distinguish EPI from other causes of similar symptoms, and common diseases with overlapping symptoms include celiac disease, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, long-standing diabetes mellitus, and inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease; less common causes include disaccharidase deficiencies, bile acid diarrhea, and infectious etiologies, such as giardiasis; these are most often suspected when a patient with EPI does not respond to PERT.

### Generalized lymphatic anomaly and gorham-stout disease: overview and recent insights [^114sjeop]. Advances in Wound Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical features and differential diagnosis of CLAs

The characteristics of CLAs and differential features from other diseases are shown in Table 2. CLAs involve multiple organs, have diverse symptoms, and are common in children and adolescents. One report described how LM proliferation during childhood is different from that in adults and that these LMs proliferate at a significant rate. The common characteristics of these diseases are lymphatic tissue lesions, including osteolytic lesions, thoracic lesions (chylothorax, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, mediastinal mass, and retroperitoneal soft-tissue mass), abdominal lesions (ascites, splenic lesions, and retroperitoneal mass), and skin lesions (lymphedema and lymphorrhea). However, to achieve a precise diagnosis, a variety of assessments, clinical, imaging, histological, and hematological examinations, are needed. In terms of the clinical laboratory findings, CLA patients often have hypoalbuminemia, hypoproteinemia, hypogammaglobulinemia, anemia, and lymphocytopenia caused by lymph leakage (chylothorax, pleural effusion, and ascites). They also have moderate or mild thrombocytopenia, low fibrinogen, and coagulopathy (increasing D-dimer and fibrinogen degradation products), called chronic localized intravascular coagulopathy (LIC). In general, vascular malformations with slow flow are associated with risk of LIC and deep vein thrombosis. The mechanisms of coagulopathy in CLAs are unknown, but are considered that platelets are involved by abnormal lymphatic endothelium entrapping. The Kasabach–Merritt phenomenon (KMP), which leads to more severe coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia, is associated with vascular tumors, tufted angioma, and kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (KHE). KLA patients also have more severe LIC and thrombocytopenia (50,000–100,000/μL) than those with LM and GLA. A recent study also showed that the serum angiopoietin 2 level in KLA and KHE with KMP patients was higher than in controls. Therefore, KLA and KHE with KMP may have similar phenotypes and pathogeneses associated with the presence of abnormal spindle cells.

Pediatric Rheumatology 2024, 22(2): PReS24-ABS-1387

Introduction: CHAPLE (Complement hyperactivation, angiopathic thrombosis and protein losing enteropathy) disease is a recently described condition with pathogenic cross-activation of the complement system, predisposing individuals to enteropathy, severe thrombosis, with novel therapeutic agents involved in the management of this rare condition 1,2.

Objectives: To describe clinical profile of CHAPLE disease with an aim to delineate the symptom onset and spectrum, serological and imaging features, as well as response to therapy in a resource limited setting.

Methods: We studied the clinical profile of 3 patients with abdominal pain and diarrhea caused by early-onset protein-losing enteropathy, edema due to hypoproteinemia, malabsorption and 1 had angiopathic thrombotic disease as well; the disorder followed an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Whole-exome sequencing was performed to identify gene variants.

Results: History of consanguinity of parents was present in all families, age at manifestation varied from 7 months to 18 months, thrombotic complication was present in 1 child (hepatic venous thrombosis), normal inflammatory markers seen in 2, one had classical granulomatous inflammation of Crohns disease, non-specific inflammation on histopathology in distal colon was noted among the rest. 1 child started on Pozelimab responded well and the other 2 children await therapy. Until definitive therapy was initiated these children were predominantly maintained on low dose steroids and replacement immunoglobulin.

Conclusion: Monogenic inflammatory bowel disease must be considered in early onset symptoms of protein losing enteropathy. CHAPLE disease must be a differential especially when there is poor response to treatment or complication of thrombosis.

### An expert perspective on phosphate dysregulation with a focus on chronic hypophosphatemia [^112vwb9n]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Expert Opinion: Practical Considerations for the Diagnosis and Management of Chronic Hypophosphatemia

A standardized definition for chronic hypophosphatemia

To help harmonize nomenclature, raise awareness, and guide clinical decision making for diseases characterized by chronic hypophosphatemia, it is important to establish a standard definition. Definitions of hypophosphatemia exist for children and adults, yet there is currently no universally accepted definition of chronic hypophosphatemia. This definition should consider age‐ and sex‐specific normal phosphate reference ranges, as well as the duration of low phosphate levels.

While we acknowledge the difficulties in defining chronic hypophosphatemia, we propose the following definition may be used in children and adults:

"At least three consecutive, morning fasting serum phosphate readings below the lower limit of normal (LLN) for healthy age‐ and sex‐matched reference ranges, taken at least 3 months apart (eg, 0, 3, and 6 months)".

However, we emphasize the importance of using clinical judgment when managing patients with hypophosphatemia. Further investigations and management should be considered without delay when there is suspicion of an underlying condition that may require earlier intervention, if severe hypophosphatemia is identified (eg, serum phosphate in adults < 0.3 mmol/L), if hypophosphatemia is associated with severe symptoms or in patients with a known genetic risk (eg, a mother with XLH) and causes of acute hypophosphatemia have been excluded. In children beyond perinatal age, the first measurement of low phosphate should prompt additional investigations. In such situations, serum phosphate measurement should be repeated as soon as possible, and treatment should be initiated promptly, without the need to formally define hypophosphatemia as a chronic condition. In all cases of chronic hypophosphatemia, it is crucial to determine the underlying cause because some disorders (eg, TIO) may require extensive diagnostic investigations and surgical treatment, whereas others may need lifelong therapy and follow‐up (eg, XLH).

### A.S.P.E.N. clinical guidelines: nutrition screening, assessment, and intervention in adults [^114uBeWh]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2011). Medium credibility.

Adult malnutrition definitions and inflammatory context — diagnoses and biomarker interpretation are described as follows: diagnoses include "(1) starvation-related malnutrition, which is chronic starvation without inflammation, (2) chronic disease–related malnutrition, where inflammation is chronic and of mild to moderate degree, and (3) acute disease or injury–related malnutrition, where inflammation is acute and severe", and "Inflammation and related compensatory mechanisms associated with disease or injury may cause anorexia and alterations in body composition and stress metabolism". For laboratory markers, "experts have advised that albumin and prealbumin not be used in isolation to assess nutrition status because they are fundamentally markers of inflammatory metabolism", while "Positive acute phase proteins such as C-reactive protein are also potent predictors of morbidity and mortality and are elevated in the presence of inflammation".

### Crystalline nephropathies [^113R1bxE]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Context

The kidney is a favored site for crystal deposition because of the high concentration of ions and molecules reached at the level of the renal tubules in the course of filtration. This review focuses on crystalline nephropathies in 4 broad categories: (1) dysproteinemia- associated, (2) drug-induced, (3) calcium-containing, and (4) metabolic or genetic.

Objective

To provide a framework for accurate identification of the diverse types of crystals encountered in the kidney in order to formulate an appropriate differential diagnosis and guide additional testing and treatment.

Data Sources

Review of pertinent published literature along with practical experience gained in a high-volume renal pathology laboratory.

Conclusions

Accurate identification of crystals encountered in the kidney is essential in detecting conditions ranging from hematologic malignancy to drug toxicity to metabolic disorders. Detailed clinical-pathologic correlation is needed to accurately diagnose the underlying cause of most crystalline nephropathies.

Edema differential and pathophysiology — Once lymphedema has been excluded, edema is attributed to increased hydrostatic pressure or decreased oncotic pressure. Increased hydrostatic pressure encompasses cardiac (cardiomyopathy, valvular disease, pericardial disease), cirrhosis with portal hypertension, renal failure, and other causes such as venous insufficiency, obstruction, thrombosis, pregnancy, and medications (CCB, NSAIDs, steroids), whereas decreased oncotic pressure reflects reduced protein intake (malnutrition), reduced protein production (cirrhosis), or protein loss (malabsorption, nephrotic syndrome).

### Differential diagnosis and management of polycythemia [^112cEBXA]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

One percent to 5% of all newborns in the United States are polycythemic. As the venous hematocrit rises above 65%, the thickness or viscosity of whole blood also increases, potentially compromising blood flow to a variety of organs. Fortunately, relatively few infants who have neonatal polycythemia or hyperviscosity develop complications attributable to their thick blood; however, controversy and the need for continued research envelop the issue of which infants are at risk and need to be treated. This article reviews the differential diagnosis, clinical presentation, and treatment of neonatal polycythemia.

### Redefining iron deficiency in patients with chronic heart failure [^112C2KYL]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Because the treatment of iron deficiency in HF does not depend on characterization of its pathogenesis, efforts to distinguish between absolute and functional iron deficiency at one particular point in time in a patient's clinical course have little therapeutic relevance. There is no rationale for identifying the relative contribution of specific pathophysiologic mechanisms for iron deficiency in clinical practice, and there is no reliable noninvasive means of achieving this goal. Nevertheless, the finding of meaningful hypoferremia together with a hypochromic microcytic anemia might prompt a diagnostic workup for a gastrointestinal malignancy.

### Approach to the patient: a case with an unusual cause of hypopituitarism [^115cwMjY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypopituitarism, which refers to insufficiency of one or more hormones of the pituitary, can be due to myriad causes. The clinical and radiological spectrum of the condition is heterogeneous, based on the patient's age, gender, clinical setting, and/or other past medical history. Hypopituitarism includes central hypocortisolism, hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, and growth hormone deficiency. Both hypo- and hyperprolactinemia can be associated with hypopituitarism, with low prolactin signifying more extensive pituitary damage. Posterior pituitary insufficiency (arginine vasopressin deficiency) occurs either in isolation or with anterior pituitary hormone deficiency. Clinical symptomatology of hypopituitarism is usually nonspecific and insidious in onset and progression. Overall, the most common cause of hypopituitarism is a pituitary adenoma and/or its management (surgery, radiotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or a combination of these). However, it is this subset of patients which is more likely to be identified and managed in a timely manner, possibly alleviating the premature mortality associated with hypopituitarism. What is more challenging is the recognition of hypopituitarism in less common settings, which may be either due to direct involvement of the pituitary (infection, traumatic brain injury, or infiltrative causes) or indirectly as a consequence of the primary process (thalassemia, vasculotoxic snakebite, subarachnoid hemorrhage). These entities are often under-recognized, and increased awareness can help in greater recognition of the burden. Further, pituitary insufficiency in most of these settings is dynamic and may progress, or rarely, show recovery of function. This renders complexity to the problem, but makes it even more imperative to suspect, screen, and appropriately manage patients with less common causes of hypopituitarism.

Introduction: A nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a disease consisting of massive leakage of proteins in urine, potentially lifethreatening due to hypovolemia, hypercoagulability and infections. It is defined by the association of edema, urinary protein > 20 g/L and serum albumin level < 10 g/L. The annual incidence of NS in the United States and Europe is estimated at about 1–7/100.000 births. Most NS result from a dysfunction of the podocytes at the level of glomerular filtration barrier. Treatment ought to be installed as early as possible in order to reduce hypoproteinemia and its secondary effects. Several NS are corticoid-sensitive but many are corticoid-resistant especially among congenital NS.

There are three types of NS, idiopathic (the most common), secondary and congenital. Congenital NS (CNS) is a NS diagnosed in utero or during the first 3 months after birth. Infantile NS cases are discovered later during the first year and childhood NS after the first year. This clinical classification is however arbitrary, since the majority of early onset NS have a genetic origin and have a widespread age of diagnosis (from fetal life to several years). Among CNS, some occur as an isolated finding but some are part of more complex syndromes. Their diagnosis has been greatly facilitated thanks to genetic progresses. On the contrary, surprisingly enough, the role of US in the diagnosis of CNS has been rarely highlighted.

### Differential diagnosis of perinatal hypophosphatasia: radiologic perspectives [^117TJtYg]. Pediatric Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Perinatal HPP is associated with a broad spectrum of imaging findings that overlap with other perinatal skeletal dysplasias. Certain features (e.g. sites of angulation and hypomineralization, spurs, metaphyseal characteristics) may help distinguish HPP from other skeletal dysplasias. ALPL gene mutation testing during pregnancy can confirm the diagnosis before delivery. Alkaline phosphatase results are essential for confirming a suspected diagnosis of perinatal HPP. Early recognition of the disease provides more opportunity for education and counseling to prepare the parents, allows for the assembly and preparedness of a multidisciplinary care team upon delivery, and provides additional time to consider and discuss treatment options, with the goal of improving duration and quality of life or minimizing unnecessary suffering for the affected child and the family.

### Delayed diagnosis of postcardiac injury syndrome [^113wGTGe]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Our case had an atypically long interval between surgery and symptom onset. She also had an atypical presentation, with systemic oedema due to low proteinaemia from the exudation of serum protein. In our case, the almost similar concentration of proteins in pericardial effusate, pleural effusate and serum (4.7 g/dL, 4.9 g/dL and 5.1 g/dL, respectively) suggests that protein leakage into the third space (pericardial cavity and pleural cavity) was the cause of hypoproteinaemia. The long latency, atypical presentation (systemic oedema and no fever) and absence of inflammatory marker elevation delayed the diagnosis in our case. However, after excluding other possible causes, we made a final diagnosis of PCIS.

Learning points

Fever and inflammatory marker (CRP, ESR) elevation may or may not be present in patients with postcardiac injury syndrome (PCIS).
PCIS can cause systemic oedema, probably due to inflammatory leakage of protein and fluid into the third space.
A long interval (9 months) between surgery and symptom onset might occur in patients with PCIS.

### Pancreatic ascites: update on diagnosis and management [^114gS8xu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

Pancreatic ascites is a diagnostic challenge because of its rarity and nonspecific clinical features. Therefore, a comprehensive diagnostic approach that incorporates a history of the presenting illness, physical examination, blood tests, imaging, and diagnostic paracentesis with fluid analysis, is crucial. As noted above, the physical findings of ascites may include cachexia, abdominal tenderness, peritonitis, abdominal distension, shifting dullness, positive fluid wave, decreased bowel sounds and extremity edema. Patients with concomitant pleural effusion may exhibit decreased breath sounds, crackles or rales, and in severe cases may be in respiratory distress.

Laboratory tests

Routine blood tests, including a complete metabolic panel, brain natriuretic peptide level, lactic acid, uric acid and complete blood cell count, can help clinicians narrow down the differential diagnosis of new-onset ascites. Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte abnormality observed in pancreatic ascites cases and is likely to be dilutional, due to fluid retention. Hypoalbuminemia is also reported in most cases, and is often secondary to severe malnutrition in the setting of chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic ascites.

On complete blood cell count, patients typically show low hemoglobin with a normal to mildly elevated white blood count, even in the absence of an underlying infection. Platelet count and coagulation factors, such as prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time and international normalized ratio, are usually normal. C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are typically elevated, especially in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Serum lipase and amylase levels are often normal or mildly elevated in pancreatic ascites, thereby rendering these tests non-diagnostic.

### Hypomagnesemia in intestinal lymphangiectasia: a case report and review of the literature [^116jNccf]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic focus and assessment

The marked hypoalbuminemia account for her edema, and the hypocalcemia account for her tetany and tingling. The diarrhea seemed to be the culprit of the hypoalbuminemia since there was no evidence of liver synthesis dysfunction or renal protein leakage. Protein-losing gastroenteropathy was suspected, and the common etiologies of protein-losing gastroenteropathy may include inflammatory bowel disease, infection and IL. While normal hsCRP, ESR and stool analysis made the former two differential diagnoses unlikely, lymphatic imaging using a 99m technetium-labeled tracer showed lymph leakage into the intestines. Endoscopically, there were whitish granules in the descending duodenum and the terminal ileum (Fig. 1), which were later proven to be dilated lymphatic vessels by pathology evaluation. IL secondary to heart dysfunction, portal vein hypertension or malignancy obstruction was ruled out by normal findings on echocardiogram and thoracic/abdominal/pelvic computed tomography scanning, respectively. The patient was eventually diagnosed with IL, which was probably secondary to radiotherapy/chemotherapy of the retroperitoneal region. Her IL was complicated by nutrient deficiencies, including hypomagnesemia.

### GLIM consensus approach to diagnosis of malnutrition: a 5-year update [^1122vAjE]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

A modified Delphi process was used, which included several ballots, biannual meetings during the ASPEN and ESPEN congresses, and email communications. After 3 years, consensus was reached, and the GLIM diagnostic model was published in three nutrition‐related journals.

The consensus process arrived at a two‐step GLIM procedure that starts with nutrition screening followed by diagnostic assessment for confirmation of malnutrition. In patients identified as being at risk of malnutrition, all five GLIM criteria should be assessed to confirm the presence of malnutrition. Three phenotypic and two etiologic criteria were selected from existing widely accepted approaches to diagnosis. All chosen criteria are well‐established nutrition‐related variables that, in their own capacity, have well‐validated prognostic value for negative clinical outcomes — ie, mortality. The three phenotypic criteria are nonvolitional weight loss, low body mass index (BMI), and low muscle mass, whereas the two etiologic criteria are reduced food intake/food assimilation and disease burden/inflammation. To confirm a malnutrition diagnosis, at least one phenotypic and one etiologic criterion must be present. Still, in occasional cases, it will not be possible to assess all five criteria. When assessment of one or more criteria is not possible for compelling practical reasons, the diagnosis of malnutrition will still be possible if, among those available, one phenotypic and one etiologic criterion are fulfilled. For exclusion of the diagnosis, all five criteria need to be assessed. Further, the severity grading of malnutrition is based solely on the phenotypic criteria. When the criteria assessment confirms the diagnosis of malnutrition, the patient should undergo a comprehensive nutrition assessment, according to available resources, to establish a treatment plan. However, it should be noted that the GLIM Consortium advises against using hypoalbuminemia as an indicator of malnutrition because of its limited sensitivity and specificity when used for this purpose.

The differential diagnosis of TMA is complex but important to inform treatment decisions. Consensus guidelines for the differential diagnosis of TMA were updated in 2015, however real-world evidence on the current diagnosis and treatment practices has not been reported. We hypothesised that there are areas of uncertainty in the work-up of patients with TMA, leading to potential delays in establishing the final diagnosis, putting patient's lives at a higher risk.

We devised a survey with the objective of understanding current practices in the diagnosis of TMA and aHUS across Europe and the Middle East and challenges when diagnosing the cause of TMA.

Serum albumin and congestion assessment in HF — serum albumin levels should be checked routinely at HF admission, and peripheral edema should be interpreted with caution in the presence of hypoalbuminemia, which has been associated with up to 6-fold higher in-hospital mortality; reduced plasma oncotic pressure from hypoalbuminemia enhances extravascular fluid accumulation, for which overzealous diuresis may deplete intravascular volume and decrease renal function and blood pressure, particularly with nephrotic syndrome or chronic malnutrition.

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^113Ef2F4]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia and Albumin Kinetics

Low serum albumin levels in malnourished or stressed individuals have often been considered to be caused by diminished synthesis. However, in most disease states in which synthesis rates have been measured, fractional synthesis rate (FSR) in plasma has been reported to be normal or mildly increased (Table 1). 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71 FSR is only decreased in liver failure where synthetic rate is related to liver function 72 and possibly in children with kwashiorkor for unknown reasons. 73 While increased fractional and absolute synthesis rates in plasma seem incongruous with decreased levels of serum albumin, they may not reflect an increase in synthesis at the whole‐body level. In addition, synthesis rate is just 1 of the factors determining total serum albumin mass in the body. Serum albumin mass is also influenced by the half‐life of serum albumin. This has been rarely measured, but turnover time has been found to be shortened in hypertension, acromegaly, nephrotic syndrome, and protein‐losing enteropathy. 65, 74, 75, 76

### Differential diagnosis of perinatal hypophosphatasia: radiologic perspectives [^1126dtGp]. Pediatric Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Perinatal hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare, potentially life-threatening, inherited, systemic metabolic bone disease that can be difficult to recognize in utero and postnatally. Diagnosis is challenging because of the large number of skeletal dysplasias with overlapping clinical features. This review focuses on the role of fetal and neonatal imaging modalities in the differential diagnosis of perinatal HPP from other skeletal dysplasias (e.g. osteogenesis imperfecta, campomelic dysplasia, achondrogenesis subtypes, hypochondrogenesis, cleidocranial dysplasia). Perinatal HPP is associated with a broad spectrum of imaging findings that are characteristic of but do not occur in all cases of HPP and are not unique to HPP, such as shortening, bowing and angulation of the long bones, and slender, poorly ossified ribs and metaphyseal lucencies. Conversely, absent ossification of whole bones is characteristic of severe lethal HPP and is associated with very few other conditions. Certain features may help distinguish HPP from other skeletal dysplasias, such as sites of angulation of long bones, patterns of hypomineralization, and metaphyseal characteristics. In utero recognition of HPP allows for the assembly and preparation of a multidisciplinary care team before delivery and provides additional time to devise treatment strategies.

### Hypercalcemic hypocalciuria: a critical differential diagnosis for hyperparathyroidism [^111Q1kNX]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

A differential diagnosis for hyperparathyroidism includes all causes of hypercalcemia; the primary causes of which are primary hyperparathyroidism and humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. Benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a rare condition of primary importance because failure to recognize this entity leads to unnecessary surgery. There are a plethora of other rare causes of hypercalcemia that can be distinguished from primary hyperparathyroidism by history and laboratory profiles. This article discusses the main and less common causes of hypercalcemia and provides guidance for distinguishing among them.

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^116vB5V9]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypoalbuminemic States (see Figure 1)

The different inflammatory states described in the previous section are all associated with low serum albumin levels. 91 Although uncomplicated undernutrition (not combined with inflammation) does not lead to or only very modestly leads to low serum albumin, in areas with endemic malnutrition, undernutrition is usually associated with infectious or noninfectious inflammation. Hypoalbuminemia is more severe in children with kwashiorkor (edema, fatty liver, skin lesions, discolored hair) than with marasmus (less edema, child more active and attentive). 95 The difference in phenotype has been attributed to differences in the microbiome. 96 Chronic parasitic disease or other chronic infections cause hypoalbuminemia and lead to growth failure. Adult malnutrition in areas with endemic malnutrition has similar characteristics. 97 In clinical practice, all acutely ill or (surgically) traumatized patients have low serum albumin levels. 66, 67, 68, 69, 98, 99, 100 In the Western world, the severity of the inflammatory effects of comorbidity, obesity, lifestyle, organ failure, and aging lead to a proportional decrease in serum albumin levels. 23, 76, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106

The combined presence of undernutrition and inflammation in malnutrition has led some authors to consider the condition as being a nutrition state caused by a combination of undernutrition and inflammatory activity. Consensus is, however, lacking between countries and nutrition societies about whether inflammation should be part of the definition of malnutrition and part of nutrition assessment. 2, 3, 107 The frequent and simultaneous presence of undernutrition and inflammation also explains why in some studies a modest correlation has been found between undernutrition and hypoalbuminemia, despite the presence of subgroups, in which undernutrition is associated with normal plasma albumin levels or where low serum albumin levels exist in chronic disease states despite adequate nutrition intake. These observations confound the value of serum albumin as an indicator of adequate nutrition intake or uptake in a sizeable subgroup of individuals despite a significant correlation in the population as a whole. 108 Regardless of how malnutrition is defined, if the objective of the clinician is to identify patients who will benefit from nutrition support, it is essential to consider both undernutrition and inflammation. Only then can the indication for nutrition support be determined and its likely effect be predicted. 109

### A pleural effusion of multiple causes [^112c9s79]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Multiple medical disorders can lead to the development of pleural effusions. Most effusions are given a single diagnosis in clinical practice. However, the cause of the effusion can change during the disease course, and concomitant yet distinct causes are often underrecognized. We highlight this point by reporting a complex case of recurrent pleural effusions with different predominant causes during the disease course. Five causes for the pleural effusion were diagnosed, namely malignant pleural effusion, empyema, chylothorax, transudative pleural effusion secondary to hypoalbuminemia, and esophagopleural fistula. This case serves as a reminder to clinicians that recurrent pleural effusion, even within the same pleural space, can arise from different causes and, whenever clinically appropriate, reinvestigation of the pleural effusion may be needed.

### Protein malnutrition after roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a challenging case and scoping review of the literature [^111fK3Um]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Although protein malnutrition (PM) is often reported after highly malabsorptive procedures, its exact incidence and mechanisms after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to present a challenging clinical case of PM after RYGB and conduct a scoping review of the literature. Among the 18 studies with 3015 RYGB patients included in the review, the median incidence of PM was 1.7% (range, 0%-8.9%), and it was diagnosed 12 to 120 months after RYGB. The most common cause is insufficient oral intake of protein; however, in cases of persistent hypoalbuminemia, a thorough diagnostic workup needs to be performed. Risk factors for PM after RYGB include specific triggering events such as intractable vomiting and dysphagia, and a total alimentary limb length less than 250 to 300 cm.

### The paradox of normal serum albumin in anorexia nervosa: a case report [^1173VtsR]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Anorexia nervosa (AN) is associated with marked decreases in caloric intake and a corresponding reduction in body weight due to abnormal self body image. Although counterintuitive, hypoalbuminemia and vitamin deficiencies are not expected consequences of this disorder. Etiologic considerations for hypoalbuminemia are discussed.

Method

The case report of a patient with AN and marked hypoalbuminemia is presented and a focused literature review is reported.

Results

Hypoalbuminemia was initially attributed to starvation. However, occult infection was ultimately responsible. Serum albumin concentration normalized with antibiotic therapy despite minimal restoration of body weight.

Discussion

Hypoalbuminemia should not be considered a characteristic feature of AN even in the setting of progressive weight loss. The presence of other potentially life-threatening conditions should be sought, as reduced serum albumin concentration is a marker of inflammation in AN.

### Protein-losing enteropathy as the principal manifestation of constrictive pericarditis [^112cQXVZ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Constrictive pericarditis represents a rare cause of protein-losing enteropathy due to intestinal lymphangiectasia. We report the case of a patient with an atypical clinical presentation of constrictive pericarditis and protein-losing enteropathy as its principal manifestation; he was successfully treated with pericardiectomy. We conclude that, constrictive pericarditis should be considered in the presence of protein losing enteropathy and also, protein-losing enteropathy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hypoalbuminemia.

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^116qY5AU]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypoalbuminemia is common in clinical practice, and serum albumin levels are often routinely measured in severely ill or malnourished patients. Although hypoalbuminemia may develop within hours in acute disease or after trauma and resuscitation in previously well‐nourished individuals and is also present in chronic inflammatory diseases despite adequate nutrition intake, it is often wrongly considered to be an indicator of inadequate nutrition intake that can be relieved by nutrition support alone. There is actually a poor correlation between the level of nutrition intake and the serum albumin level. For example, anorexia nervosa patients have normal or only slightly decreased serum albumin levels despite very low nutrition intake, unless infected or traumatized. Many anorexia nervosa patients have a body mass index < 18 kg/m 2 and have low muscle mass and strength, but they are otherwise functioning relatively well. 1 Further, patients with chronic diseases and hypoalbuminemia lose fat‐free mass, considered to be an essential indicator of the undernourished state, despite adequate food intake. 2, 3 Rather than reflecting undernutrition per se, hypoalbuminemia is more a reflection of the extent of physiologic stress resulting from disease or trauma‐related inflammation. These considerations do not exclude the likelihood that hypoalbuminemia often coincides with a negative nutrient balance for which nutrition support is indicated.

The objectives of this semicomprehensive review are to define the pathophysiology of hypoalbuminemia associated with increases in capillary permeability and altered kinetics of serum albumin in inflammatory states, including states of physiologic or pathologic growth. In addition, the potentially beneficial role of these changes will be highlighted as well as the significance of increasing or decreasing serum albumin levels as indicators of improvement or deterioration of the clinical state. Finally, the significance of hypoalbuminemia as a risk indicator of negative outcome after medical treatment or of diminished longevity will be discussed.

In view of the many areas of pathophysiology addressed, we will limit the number of references to subjects that are not commonly accepted knowledge. In this area, very few randomized trials and meta‐analyses have been performed. Much of the material in this paper regards the pathophysiology of inflammation at the whole‐body level and recent, more in‐depth papers on cell biology and the beneficial intracellular and extracellular role of albumin.

### Hypopituitarism: clinical features, diagnosis, and management [^112td5QF]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Hypopituitarism is characterized by loss of function of the anterior pituitary gland. It is a rare condition that can present at any age and is caused by pathology of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis or one of many gene mutations. The symptoms and signs of hypopituitarism may evolve over several years and be nonspecific or related to the effects of the underlying disease process or to hormone deficiencies. Investigation of patients requires a combination of basal hormone levels and dynamic function tests; management requires regular monitoring. The goal of physicians managing patients who have hypopituitarism is to improve their health and long-term outcome.

### Severe multifactorial metabolic alkalosis in the emergency department: a case report [^114x95Ni]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Metabolic alkalosis is an uncommon clinical entity resulting from a wide variety of underlying etiologies including gastrointestinal, renal, endocrine, and metabolic causes. It is a typically clinically silent condition; however, severe cases can be life-threatening, mandating both a systematic investigative approach and an early aggressive management strategy.

Case Report

We present a case of a 58-year-old man with severe, multifactorial metabolic alkalosis (pH 7.72, HCO 3–42 mmol/L, pCO 2 31 mm Hg) resulting from refractory vomiting, severe hypokalemia (2.0 mmol/L), and hypoalbuminemia (albumin 20 g/L). WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Severe metabolic alkalosis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Clinicians need to be aware of the potential underlying causes in these cases, as well as how to delineate between chloride- and non-chloride-depleted states, which dictates initial treatment. We provide a pragmatic summary of the evaluation, pertinent investigations, and early management of these cases.

### Differential diagnosis for chronic hypokalaemia [^1168uQmA]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Doctors will often see patients with chronic hypokalaemia, frequently this is secondary to gastrointestinal losses, diuretics or renal disease. However, in this case report we review a rarer cause of chronic hypokalaemia-Gitelman syndrome (GS).GS is an uncommon genetic disorder which causes primary renal tubular hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis with secondary hypomagnesaemia and hypocalciuria. Although rare, it is important to remember GS when considering differential diagnoses for chronic hypokalaemia. We report the case of a woman who presented to the ophthalmology department with sclerochoroidal calcification. An ophthalmologist was reviewing the medical literature, which prompted them to investigate for GS. A diagnosis was formed at that time based on the blood and urine chemistry results. However, later we were able to offer the patient genetic testing, which confirmed our provisional diagnosis.

### Life-threatening onset of coeliac disease: a case report and literature review [^114Y3HLp]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Case report

A 34-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency unit complaining of limb numbness and watery diarrhoea (8–10 bowel movements/day) which started 2 weeks earlier. The patient reported a weight loss of about 10 kg in the last 2 months in the absence of hyporexia. Her clinical history unravelled microcytic anaemia treated with oral iron replacement. Physical examination showed severe weakness of the limbs with a bilaterally positive Trousseau's sign without cardiorespiratory abnormalities. Vital parameters were within the normal range. The abdomen was flat, without tenderness, while auscultation disclosed increased intestinal sounds. Her ECG showed a sinus rhythm with type 1 atrioventricular block, flat T waves associated with U waves and an elongated QTc interval (570 ms). Laboratory tests revealed severe electrolyte imbalance, with hyponatraemia (133 mmol/L), hypokalaemia (1.6 mmol/L), hypocalcaemia (ionised calcium of 0.9 mmol/L), hypophosphataemia (1.6 mg/dL) and hypomagnesaemia (1.4 mmol/L). Furthermore, the patient had hypochromic microcytic anaemia (haemoglobin of 85 g/L, with a mean cell volume of 68 fL and a mean cell haemoglobin of 20.6 pg), normal platelet count (297×10ˆ9/L), iron (serum iron 18 µg/dL; ferritin 2 ng/mL) and folate deficiency (2 ng/mL), as well as hypoproteinaemia and hypoalbuminaemia (total serum protein 4.4 g/dL; albumin 2.6 g/dL). Due to severe electrolyte imbalance, a conspicuous electrolyte replacement was rapidly administered, leading to a slight improvement in electrocardiographic abnormalities. The patient was then admitted to the internal medicine ward for adequate investigation and treatment. During the hospitalisation, the common causes of infectious diarrhoea were excluded by stool cultures, and the faecal occult blood test resulted negative. Both ultrasound and abdominal X-ray examinations were unremarkable. Liver function tests revealed a slight increase of transaminases, with alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase values of 47 U/L and 60 U/L (n.v. 5–35 for both parameters), respectively. Based on the lack of fever, normal C reactive protein and the presence of non-bloody, watery diarrhoea, the patient was further evaluated with an upper endoscopy. The examination revealed stigmata of villous atrophy at the duodenal level (figure 1), where biopsies were taken from the bulb and the second portion. Histopathological analysis showed the presence of a severe villous atrophy (Marsh-Oberhüber grade 3c) (figure 2) without any evidence of aberrant intraepithelial lymphocytes. Based on the histopathological result, we used enzyme-linked immunoassay to test IgA anti-TG2, which turned to be positive at low titre (23 U/mL, n.v. < 10 U/mL). This result was associated with the positivity of IgA antiendomysial antibodies (1:80) revealed by indirect immunofluorescence. The genetic test showed human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 positivity. Therefore, a firm diagnosis of CD was established and the patient started a gluten-free diet (GFD). Due to rapid improvement after gluten withdrawal, a course with steroid treatment was deemed not necessary. Since diarrhoea and paraesthesia showed significant improvement with complete regression in about a week, the patient was discharged in good health.

### Management of ascites: expert panel narrative review [^117WEX5C]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ascites can develop in the setting of a variety of pathologies. The approach to treatment depends on accurate determination of the underlying cause, for which fluid analysis plays a central role. In particular, the serum-ascites-albumin gradient serves as a primary diagnostic test for differentiating among causes, with certain additional fluid tests performed based on clinical suspicion. Treatment options range from nonspecific fluid removal, including large-volume paracentesis and tunneled peritoneal catheters, to targeted therapies (e.g., diuretics, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, and lymphangiography). Societal guidelines exist for the approach to cirrhotic ascites, but the management of other less common causes remains less well defined. The goal of this AJR Expert Panel Narrative Review is to provide guidance for the diagnosis and management of ascites, based on available evidence and the authors' clinical experience.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to evaluation of hepatopulmonary syndrome, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to obtain macroaggregated albumin scan as a complementary tool to quantify the degree of shunting in patients with severe hypoxemia and coexistent intrinsic lung disease or to assess the prognosis in patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome and very severe hypoxemia (PaO2 < 50 mmHg). Recognize that neither contrast echocardiography nor macroaggregated albumin scan can definitively differentiate discrete arteriovenous communications from diffuse precapillary and capillary dilatations or cardiac shunts.

Diagnostic and referral strategies

Making a prompt diagnosis is key to good management of IBD, preventing malnutrition at diagnosis and allowing early therapeutic intervention. Unfortunately, there is frequently a delay of months or years in referral to specialist care, preventing the diagnostic process of endoscopy and histological confirmation. Drivers of this are varied including varied presentations, alongside inflammatory markers not always being raised and fluctuating symptoms. Family history is common and should lower the threshold for investigation.

### Investigation and management of hypocalcaemia [^111P3pbr]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypocalcaemia is a common clinical scenario in children with a range of aetiological causes. It will often present with common symptoms but may occasionally be identified in an asymptomatic child. An understanding of the physiological regulation of plasma calcium is important in understanding the potential cause of hypocalcaemia and its appropriate management. The age of presentation will influence the likely differential diagnosis. We have presented a stepwise approach to the investigation of hypocalcaemia dependent on the circulating serum parathyroid hormone level at the time of presentation. The acute and long-term management of the underlying condition is also reviewed.

### Malnutrition in gastrointestinal disorders: detection and nutritional assessment [^113yfdgf]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

All patients with significant gastrointestinal disease should be clinically assessed for protein calorie malnutrition by using the Subjective Global Assessment. Blood tests for anemia, electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, ferritin, vitamin B 12, and folate should be considered for assessment of major micronutrients. Where malabsorption or inflammatory bowel disease is diagnosed, bone mineral density using dual beam x-ray absorptiometry, 25-OH vitamin D levels, and measurement of other vitamins and trace elements should be considered. In addition, in at-risk patients, vitamin and trace element clinical deficiency syndromes should be considered during patient assessment.

### Primary protein-losing enteropathy in anti-double-stranded DNA disease: the initial and sole clinical manifestation of occult systemic lupus erythematosus? [^115tYY7a]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia and generalized edema is a common clinical problem and the etiology is usually clear: cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, primary gastrointestinal disorders, malnutrition, etc. We present a 23-year-old previously healthy woman of Korean background who presented with generalized edema and a serum albumin of 9 g/L (normal, 35–45 g/L). Intensive investigations failed to reveal liver, renal, or inflammatory gastrointestinal mucosal disease. The antinuclear antibody was positive at a titer of 1:80, and extractable nuclear antigens were positive for SSA/anti-Ro. Anti-double-stranded DNA was markedly elevated at 4.6 kU/L (normal, 0–2.0 kU/L). A technetium 99M-labeled albumin study revealed a protein-losing enteropathy, despite normal histologic full-thickness jejunal biopsies. A diagnosis of occult systemic lupus erythematosus resulting in increased intestinal vascular permeability was made. The hypoalbuminemia remained in long-term remission after the initiation of induction and maintenance immunosuppression.

### Eosinophilic gastroenteritis with severe protein-losing enteropathy: successful treatment with budesonide [^1166rHY6]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2006). Low credibility.

We report the clinical, laboratory, endoscopic and histopathological findings in a 40-year-old woman with watery diarrhoea and hypoproteinaemia. Elevated alpha(1)-antitrypsin clearance confirmed massive protein-losing enteropathy. Gastroscopic and colonoscopic biopsies showed abundant infiltration of the small bowel wall with eosinophils in proximal duodenum and terminal ileum, respectively. These findings established the diagnosis of eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Both the inflammatory alterations and the severe intestinal protein loss were successfully treated with budesonide, a topically active corticosteroid preparation with controlled small bowel release. The case report illustrates that remission of protein-losing enteropathy secondary to eosinophilic gastroenteritis can be achieved with budesonide, thus supporting its use for this uncommon disease characterised by inflammatory intestinal lesions.

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^114LpzTy]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Other plasma proteins have also been promoted as markers of inflammation. C‐reactive protein (CRP) is a true acute‐phase protein rising within 10 hours to plasma levels > 100 mg/L after major surgery or acute sepsis. CRP is present in very low concentrations in healthy individuals but strongly upregulated, stimulated by IL‐6 and NO rising immediately after trauma or infection. There is a close inverse correlation between increases in CRP and decreases in serum albumin levels after 48 hours in well‐resuscitated septic or traumatized patients. Thereafter, CRP drops quickly after 3–4 days to low, but still modestly increased, levels if the proinflammatory phase is successful. 147 In this phase, plasma CRP level is primarily an indicator of the severity of the primary insult, initiating innate immunity to clear tissue debris and microorganisms and their products. 148 Thereafter, in the anti‐inflammatory phase, CRP is neither a precise indicator of the severity of the metabolic response, nor a very precise indicator of whether there is improvement or deterioration of the clinical state. 147 Only in the presence of renewed or unrelenting tissue damage, CRP will steeply increase or remain strongly elevated. Plasma albumin is a constitutive protein, required in health and disease. After an initial steep drop, plasma albumin levels continue to decrease modestly until 3–7 days after operation, when they start to increase slowly in the case of clinical recovery. 4 Normal levels may only be reached after 3–4 months, reflecting the anti‐inflammatory phase promoting wound healing and tissue rebuilding and remodelling.

### The investigation of hypocalcaemia and rickets [^112wy7NJ]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2003). Low credibility.

Our understanding of disorders that present with hypocalcaemia has advanced rapidly in the past decade. The molecular basis of many of these disorders and conditions associated with phosphate wasting has now been established. While many children will need specialist involvement, they often will present to general paediatricians, and appropriate investigations prior to intervention will enable early diagnosis. Not all children with hypocalcaemia and low or low normal parathyroid hormone levels have isolated hypoparathyroidism, and clinicians need to be aware of the potential for misdiagnosis. Outpatient departments and paediatric wards should have a readily accessible and comprehensive list of bloods that need to be taken when a child presents with hypocalcaemia or rickets.

### Protein energy malnutrition [^115uhAZf]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Protein energy malnutrition (PEM) is a common problem worldwide and occurs in both developing and industrialized nations. In the developing world, it is frequently a result of socioeconomic, political, or environmental factors. In contrast, protein energy malnutrition in the developed world usually occurs in the context of chronic disease. There remains much variation in the criteria used to define malnutrition, with each method having its own limitations. Early recognition, prompt management, and robust follow up are critical for best outcomes in preventing and treating PEM.

### Practical guidance for the diagnosis and management of secondary hypogammaglobulinemia: a Work group report of the AAAAI primary immunodeficiency and altered immune response committees [^113aHFWq]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) with secondary hypogammaglobulinemia (SHG) — evaluation and management: SHG, lymphopenia, and increased risk for frequent infections may occur in PLE, and SHG due to PLE should be suspected in edematous patients with low albumin when other causes of protein loss, suboptimal synthesis, or malnutrition have been excluded; increased clearance of alpha-1 antitrypsin is consistent with a diagnosis of PLE, and reduced serum concentrations of albumin, fibrinogen, cholesterol, transferrin, ceruloplasmin, and fat-soluble vitamins are variably observed. Genetic testing for monogenic causes of very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD) should be considered in pediatric enteropathy with hypogammaglobulinemia, as well as loss-of-function mutations in SLCO2A1. For treatment evidence, in a report of 2 pediatric patients with severe SHG due to PLE, an infusion of 200 mg/kg IVIG increased serum IgG to approximately 700 mg/dL, but levels were slightly above 350 mg/dL by 7 days post-infusion; it has been suggested that IgG-RT be considered if prophylactic antibiotics are inadequate at preventing infections. SCIG may possibly be preferable for patients with protein-losing conditions, and in a case series of 3 patients with PLE, SCIG led to decreased infections and more stable IgG levels than IVIG; however, SCIG use for non-PI protein-losing conditions would be considered off-label because it is not FDA-approved. Overall, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of IgG-RT in PLE, and vaccination per CDC guidelines is recommended.

### Hypoalbuminemia in acute illness: is there a rationale for intervention? A meta-analysis of cohort studies and controlled trials [^111Nt5EN]. Annals of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether hypoalbuminemia is an independent risk factor for poor outcome in the acutely ill, and to assess the potential of exogenous albumin administration for improving outcomes in hypoalbuminemic patients.

Summary Background Data

Hypoalbuminemia is associated with poor outcomes in acutely ill patients, but whether this association is causal has remained unclear. Trials investigating albumin therapy to correct hypoalbuminemia have proven inconclusive.

Methods

A meta-analysis was conducted of 90 cohort studies with 291,433 total patients evaluating hypoalbuminemia as an outcome predictor by multivariate analysis and, separately, of nine prospective controlled trials with 535 total patients on correcting hypoalbuminemia.

Results

Hypoalbuminemia was a potent, dose-dependent independent predictor of poor outcome. Each 10-g/L decline in serum albumin concentration significantly raised the odds of mortality by 137%, morbidity by 89%, prolonged intensive care unit and hospital stay respectively by 28% and 71%, and increased resource utilization by 66%. The association between hypoalbuminemia and poor outcome appeared to be independent of both nutritional status and inflammation. Analysis of dose-dependency in controlled trials of albumin therapy suggested that complication rates may be reduced when the serum albumin level attained during albumin administration exceeds 30 g/L.

Conclusions

Hypoalbuminemia is strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes. Further well-designed trials are needed to characterize the effects of albumin therapy in hypoalbuminemic patients. In the interim, there is no compelling basis to withhold albumin therapy if it is judged clinically appropriate.

### ASPEN-FELANPE clinical guidelines [^117D9ugB]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Enterocutaneous fistula (ECF) — nutrition status assessment (Question 1): We suggest the following: Malnutrition be diagnosed by nutrition history, including unintentional weight loss and estimation of energy/ nutrient intake, and physical examination. Assessment for malnutrition be conducted at the time of diagnosis of an ECF; if malnutrition is not present at baseline, periodic nutrition assessment is warranted as patients with fistulas have a high likelihood of becoming malnourished due to nutrient malabsorption, fluid and electrolyte losses, and sepsis. Serum protein concentrations be obtained prior to and during nutrition therapy since they are prognostic outcome indicators, yet are not sensitive nutrition markers. Quality of Evidence: Very low. Assessment of nutrition status at the time of ECF diagnosis may be performed using a number of tools, although none has been specifically validated for use in ECF.

When symptoms persist despite adequate medical treatment, providers should re-evaluate treatment compliance and differential diagnoses, as most frequently failure of treatment will be due to 1 of these 2 causes, and if compliance with optimal medical therapy is confirmed, careful attention should be given to alarm signs or symptoms that may suggest unrecognized differential diagnoses that mimic GERD.

In 1891, Csatáry1 showed that there was a decrease in the total plasma proteins in certain forms of nephritis and that the albumin fraction was lower than the globulin. The significance of this observation was lost until Epstein, 2 in a series of studies, confirmed it and found it applicable only in those forms of renal disorders then designated as "nephrosis, " a term coined to connote diseases of the kidney that are not "inflammations". The dominant clinical evidence of "nephrosis" is dropsy. Epstein held that the dropsy was the result of the loss of protein by way of the kidneys and was associated with hypoproteinemia. In order to explain the relation of the hypoproteinemia to the dropsy, he applied the neglected law of Starling. Starling showed that the exchange of water between the blood and the body tissues depended on a balance between the colloidal osmotic pressure of the. MOSCHCOWITZ E. HYPOPROTEINEMIA.

The reported sensitivity of the PFA-100 for diagnosing von Willebrand's disease and other platelet function disorders is 88 to 90 percent with a specificity of 86 to 94 percent. 23, 24 Studies have concluded that the PFA-100 is a useful screening test, 23, 24 but this conclusion is still being debated. 24–28 Although the PFA-100 is more sensitive than bleeding time, a negative result should not preclude further testing for von Willebrand's disease or other platelet function disorders. If the PFA-100 is negative, the physician should review the initial history to determine if further testing should be performed. MIXING STUDIES AND INHIBITOR AND FACTOR ASSAYS A mixing study determines if the patient has a clotting factor deficiency or an inhibitor to a factor. When one part of the patient's blood is mixed with one part of normal blood, the inhibitor in the patient's blood disables the factor in the normal blood. The PTT stays prolonged and does not "correct.

" Inhibitor assays are then performed to identify which inhibitor is present. When the blood from a patient with a factor VIII deficiency is mixed with normal blood, the PTT should normalize or correct. Factor assays are then performed to identify which factor is deficient. RESOLUTION OF CASE STUDIES Case One. Laboratory testing included a normal blood count and platelet count. A PFA-100 test was abnormal to collagen/epinephrine and collagen/adenosine diphosphate. Further testing was diagnostic for von Willebrand's disease. Case Two. A complete blood count, PT, PTT, and PFA-100 were normal. The patient was reassured that with a low bleeding score, a negative family history, and an unremarkable physical examination, she most likely has purpura simplex. She was told to follow up if her symptoms got worse or if she had any new symptoms. Case Three.

Laboratory evaluation included a hemoglobin count of 7 g per dL, a platelet count of 400 × 10 3 per μL, a PT of 12 seconds, and a PTT of 100 seconds. A mixing study did not return the PTT to normal. Measurement of factor VIII showed a level of 1 percent, and an assay for the presence of a factor VIII inhibitor showed a high-titer inhibitor.
