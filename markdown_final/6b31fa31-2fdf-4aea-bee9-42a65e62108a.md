## Question

Cpap/bipap in gi bleed

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether CPAP or BiPAP has a role in gastrointestinal bleeding, and under what circumstances, if any, they should be used. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the airway and aspiration risks in upper versus lower GI bleeding. Then, I should verify whether any major guidelines endorse CPAP/BiPAP for bleeding patients. Next, I will review evidence and expert statements that explicitly list GI bleeding as a contraindication to noninvasive ventilation. After that, I should consider the physiological risks of positive pressure in hypovolemia and active hematemesis. Finally, I will outline the recommended airway strategy, including when to intubate and when to avoid NIV, and synthesize a practical, clinically grounded recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risks. Upper GI bleeding carries a high aspiration risk due to hematemesis, blood in the stomach, and frequent need for sedation during endoscopy, whereas lower GI bleeding typically involves less aspiration hazard unless there is concurrent vomiting or altered mental status, so I need to be careful not to overgeneralize from UGIB to LGIB without verifying those features [^115otPWm] [^1172Tqni].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance on airway protection. The European non-variceal UGIB guideline advises prophylactic intubation only in the context of severe hematemesis, agitation, or inability to protect the airway, and Baveno VII suggests intubation in variceal bleeding with altered consciousness and active vomiting, emphasizing rapid extubation after endoscopy, which already hints that routine positive pressure by mask could worsen aspiration rather than help in this setting [^115otPWm] [^112TBySt].

> Wait, let me verify whether any high-credibility source directly addresses CPAP/BiPAP in GI bleeding. I need to check contraindication lists for noninvasive ventilation. Several studies and reviews list severe upper GI bleeding and high aspiration risk as absolute contraindications to NIV, with one ICU cohort explicitly excluding severe UGIB from NIV and a COPD study excluding active UGIB outright, which supports the notion that NIV is inappropriate in active UGIB due to aspiration risk and hemodynamic considerations [^114dBj7P] [^114aVQCm] [^116Ga1iX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should examine why NIV is contraindicated mechanistically. Positive pressure can insufflate the stomach, worsen regurgitation, and promote aspiration of blood, and in hypovolemic patients, positive intrathoracic pressure can reduce venous return and precipitate hypotension; in trauma and hemorrhagic shock literature, positive pressure during intubation is associated with potentially dangerous hypotension in hypovolemia, reinforcing caution about positive pressure in bleeding patients without a protected airway [^116BfZNn].

> I should confirm what to do instead of CPAP/BiPAP when respiratory support is needed. For UGIB with airway risk, secure the airway with endotracheal intubation, ideally with rapid sequence induction and a cuffed tube, and use adjuncts like a nasogastric tube to decompress before endoscopy; for pre-oxygenation in high-risk hypoxemic patients, avoid BiPAP if there is vomiting or hematemesis and favor high-flow nasal cannula or supplemental oxygen while preparing for intubation, reserving positive pressure only when aspiration risk is low and being ready to suction immediately [^115otPWm] [^1172Tqni] [^115QzdmF].

> But wait, what if the bleeding is lower GI and the patient is hypoxemic — could CPAP/BiPAP help then? Let me reconsider. Even in LGIB, if there is any hematemesis, active vomiting, altered mental status, or inability to protect the airway, the same aspiration logic applies and NIV remains unsafe; if there is truly no aspiration risk and the patient needs ventilatory support for hypoxemia or hypercapnia, high-flow nasal cannula is generally preferred and safer than mask NIV in this context, with close monitoring and a low threshold to intubate if the patient deteriorates [^115QzdmF].

> I should double-check whether any GI bleeding guideline even mentions CPAP/BiPAP as a therapy. Scanning ACG and BSG guidance for UGIB and LGIB, the focus is on hemodynamic resuscitation, transfusion thresholds, endoscopic timing, and reversal of anticoagulation, with no endorsement of CPAP/BiPAP for bleeding itself, which aligns with the notion that NIV has no therapeutic role in managing GI bleeding and may be harmful in UGIB scenarios [^113Ncu8G] [^116qgYkF] [^112K37Q7].

> Let me synthesize a practical recommendation. CPAP/BiPAP should not be used in patients with active upper GI bleeding because of high aspiration risk and potential hemodynamic compromise; instead, prioritize airway protection with endotracheal intubation when indicated, provide oxygen via high-flow nasal cannula or face mask as tolerated, and proceed with guideline-directed resuscitation and urgent endoscopy. In lower GI bleeding without aspiration risk features, NIV may be considered only if absolutely necessary for respiratory failure, but high-flow nasal cannula is generally safer and preferred, with continuous readiness to escalate to intubation if mental status or airway protection worsens [^115otPWm] [^1172Tqni] [^113Ncu8G].

---

CPAP/BiPAP are **not indicated for GI bleeding** and are generally contraindicated in active upper GI bleeding due to aspiration risk [^116Ga1iX]. They do not control bleeding, may increase aspiration, and can worsen hemodynamics in hypovolemia [^116BfZNn]. Use **supplemental oxygen** for hypoxemia and reserve CPAP/BiPAP only for **coexisting respiratory failure** without aspiration risk, with close monitoring. If airway protection is needed, intubate rather than use noninvasive ventilation [^115otPWm].

## Pathophysiology of gastrointestinal bleeding

GI bleeding is categorized as **upper (UGIB)** — esophagus, stomach, or duodenum — or **lower (LGIB)** — distal to the ligament of Treitz. UGIB is more often severe and carries a higher risk of aspiration due to hematemesis and altered mental status [^115otPWm].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) and the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) provide clear recommendations for managing GI bleeding, focusing on hemodynamic stabilization, blood transfusion, and endoscopic intervention [^113Ncu8G] [^116qgYkF]. Notably, these guidelines **do not recommend CPAP or BiPAP** for GI bleeding management.

---

## Risks and complications associated with CPAP/BiPAP in GI bleeding

CPAP and BiPAP are primarily used for respiratory conditions such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and acute respiratory failure [^113V56sM] [^115Lposv]. Their use in GI bleeding patients presents several **significant risks and complications**:

- **Aspiration risk**: CPAP/BiPAP can increase the risk of aspiration, particularly in upper GI bleeding, where hematemesis and altered mental status are common. Positive pressure ventilation may force gastric contents into the airway, leading to aspiration pneumonia and respiratory complications [^116Ga1iX].

- **Hemodynamic instability**: Positive pressure ventilation can reduce venous return and cardiac output, potentially exacerbating hypotension and shock in hypovolemic patients with GI bleeding [^116BfZNn].

- **Mask-related complications**: CPAP/BiPAP masks can cause discomfort, facial skin breakdown, and air leaks, complicating patient management and potentially increasing the risk of aspiration.

---

## Clinical evidence and expert opinions

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting the use of CPAP or BiPAP in GI bleeding management. Expert consensus and clinical guidelines consistently advise against their use, particularly in upper GI bleeding, due to the significant risks outlined above [^116Ga1iX].

---

## Alternative respiratory management strategies

When respiratory support is needed in GI bleeding patients, **alternative strategies** should be considered:

- **Supplemental oxygen**: Administer supplemental oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturation and end-organ oxygenation [^115otPWm].

- **Endotracheal intubation**: In cases of severe upper GI bleeding, altered mental status, or inability to protect the airway, endotracheal intubation is recommended to secure the airway and prevent aspiration [^115otPWm].

- **High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC)**: HFNC may be considered in selected patients with mild respiratory distress, but careful monitoring for aspiration risk is essential.

---

## Clinical scenarios where CPAP/BiPAP might be considered

While generally contraindicated, CPAP/BiPAP may be considered in **specific clinical scenarios** where the benefits outweigh the risks:

- **Lower GI bleeding without aspiration risk**: In patients with lower GI bleeding who are hemodynamically stable, without hematemesis, and with intact airway protection, CPAP/BiPAP may be considered if respiratory support is needed for coexisting conditions such as obstructive sleep apnea or mild respiratory distress.

- **Post-endoscopic hemostasis**: In rare cases, after successful endoscopic hemostasis and stabilization, CPAP/BiPAP may be considered for patients with pre-existing respiratory conditions requiring non-invasive ventilation.

---

## Monitoring and precautions

If CPAP/BiPAP is used in GI bleeding patients, **strict monitoring and precautions** are essential:

- **Continuous monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and hemodynamic parameters is essential.

- **Aspiration precautions**: Patients should be positioned upright, and frequent assessment for signs of aspiration should be conducted.

- **Rapid intervention**: Immediate access to airway management equipment and personnel trained in endotracheal intubation is critical.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

CPAP and BiPAP are **not recommended for routine management** of GI bleeding due to significant risks, including aspiration, hemodynamic instability, and mask-related complications. Their use should be limited to specific clinical scenarios where the benefits clearly outweigh the risks, and even then, only with strict monitoring and precautions. Alternative respiratory management strategies, such as supplemental oxygen and endotracheal intubation, should be prioritized based on current clinical guidelines and expert consensus [^1172Tqni] [^115otPWm].

Initial management

A thorough history and clinical examination of the patient can provide an indication as to the cause of bleeding, but this indication is not certain until direct visualisation at endoscopy. Regardless of cause, any patient with haemodynamic instability should be appropriately resuscitated by use of a systematic approach.

Airway and breathing

Prophylactic intubation for airway protection in UGIB has not been investigated in a large randomised controlled trial. A few meta-analyses have shown that prophylactic intubation does not reduce incidence of pneumonia, length of stay in hospital, or risk of mortality, and in some studies, the risk is increased. One of these meta-analyses of 10 observational studies and 6068 patients showed no effect on mortality (odds ratio 1.92, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 5.23; P = 0.20), but did show a significant increase in aspiration (3.85, 1.46 to 10.25; P = 0.01) and pneumonia (4.17, 1.82 to 9.57; P < 0.001). These observational studies are likely to have involved selection bias, therefore, results should be interpreted with caution.

The European non-variceal UGIB guidelines recommend that prophylactic intubation should be performed only in the context of severe haematemesis, agitation, or inability to protect the airway. The Baveno VII guidance for variceal bleeding suggests use of intubation in patients with altered consciousness and actively vomiting blood, with extubation as soon as possible after endoscopy. In these situations, early anaesthetic input should be provided. Patients unable to tolerate endoscopy under conscious sedation might also require intubation.

Supplemental oxygen should be administered to achieve target saturations and maintain end organ oxygenation. Close observation is required of patients using face masks given the risk of aspiration.

### Performance of noninvasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure in critically ill patients: a prospective, observational, cohort study [^114dBj7P]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design and patient selection

This prospective observational single center cohort study was conducted in a forty-one bed, open mixed ICU of a tertiary care hospital in São Paulo, Brazil. This study was approved by the institutional review board of Hospital Albert Einstein, who waived the need for informed consent in view of the observational characteristic of the study (protocol number: 19301213.5.0000.0071).

During a three-month period, all consecutive patients admitted to the ICU that presented a peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2) lower than 90% despite oxygen delivered through a Venturi Mask [fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2) around of 50%] or by an oxygen bag (FiO 2 around 100%) that received NIV, except for palliative care purposes, were included in this study.

Patients were excluded when they were under eighteen, had previous tracheostomy, used NIV for palliative care or presented contraindications to receiving NIV, including cardiac or respiratory arrest, Glasgow Coma Scale ≤ 10, severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding, hemodynamic instability, unstable cardiac arrhythmia, facial surgery or trauma, upper airway obstruction, inability to cooperate or protect the airway, inability to clear respiratory secretions or high risk for aspiration. The researches followed the patients and did not interfere in the ICU medical and multidisciplinary staff decisions.

Protocol of niv use in the ICU

Noninvasive ventilation was applied to patients admitted to the ICU that presented a SpO 2 lower than 90% despite oxygen delivered through a Venturi Mask (FiO 2 around of 50%) or by an oxygen bag (FiO 2 around 100%). Noninvasive ventilation was delivered by a total face mask, secured with head straps, coupled to a BIPAP Vision™ (Respironics INC®, Pennsylvania, USA). For patients with a nasogastric tube, a seal connector in the dome of the mask was used to minimize air leakage. After the mask was attached to the patient, pressure support could be increased from 5 up to 20 cm H 2 O to obtain an exhaled tidal volume of 6 mL/kg of predicted body weight, a respiratory rate lower than 30 breaths per minute, attenuation of respiratory accessory muscle activity and achievement of patient's comfort. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was initiated at 5 cm H 2 O and increased in steps of 2 to 3 cm H 2 O up to 15 cm H 2 O until the FiO 2 requirement was 60% or less in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure.

### How I manage a difficult intubation [^115QzdmF]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Physiologically difficult intubation

Patients with severe chronic lung disease, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, or an SpO 2 < 100% after pre-oxygenation are at increased risk for hypoxemia during intubation. Providing positive pressure ventilation for these high-risk patients during pre-oxygenation and between induction and laryngoscopy can help prevent hypoxemia. The primary concern regarding positive pressure ventilation in this setting is aspiration. For patients at high risk for hypoxemia and low risk for aspiration (e.g. those without vomiting, hematemesis, or hemoptysis), we pre-oxygenate with non-invasive bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilation with 100% FiO 2 for 5 min whenever feasible. For patients at high risk for hypoxemia and high risk for aspiration, we pre-oxygenate with 60 l per minute of 100% FiO 2 via high-flow nasal cannula or with supplemental oxygen via standard face mask and nasal cannula. The recent PreVent trial found that positive pressure bag-mask ventilation between induction and laryngoscopy reduced severe hypoxemia during tracheal intubation in the ICU. The PreVent trial excluded patients with very high risk for aspiration (e.g. vomiting, hematemesis, hemoptysis). Therefore, for patients with very high risk of aspiration, we provide supplemental oxygen alone without positive pressure after induction, whereas for patients at high risk for hypoxemia and without high-risk features for aspiration, we provide positive pressure ventilation with either BiPAP or bag-mask ventilation between induction and laryngoscopy.

### Postoperative CPAP and BiPAP use can be safely omitted after laparoscopic roux-en-Y gastric bypass [^115bFZGM]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is prevalent in the morbidly obese population. The need for routine preoperative testing for OSA has been debated in bariatric surgery publications. Most investigators have advocated the use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) in the postoperative setting; however, others have reported pouch perforations or other gastrointestinal complications as a result of their use. From a review of our experience, we present an algorithm for the safe postoperative treatment of patients with OSA without the use of CPAP or BiPAP.

Methods

From January 2003 to December 2007, 1095 laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypasses were performed at our institution. Preoperative testing for OSA was not routinely performed. A prospective database was maintained. The data included patient demographics, co-morbidities (including OSA and CPAP/BiPAP use), perioperative events, complications, and follow-up information. Patients with known OSA were not given CPAP/BiPAP after surgery. They were observed in a monitored setting during their inpatient stay, ensuring continuous oxygen saturation of > 92%. All patients used patient-controlled analgesia, were trained in the use of incentive spirometry, and ambulated within a few hours of surgery. The outcomes were compared between the OSA patients using preoperative CPAP/BiPAP versus those with OSA without preoperative CPAP/BiPAP versus patients with no history of OSA.

Results

A total of 811 patients were included in the study group with no known history of OSA. Of the 284 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of OSA, 144 were CPAP/BiPAP dependent. Statistically significant differences were present in age distribution and gender, with men having greater CPAP/BiPAP dependency. No significant differences were found in body mass index, length of stay, pulmonary complications, or deaths. One pulmonary complication occurred in the OSA, CPAP/BiPAP-dependent group, three in the OSA, non-CPAP group, and six in the no-known OSA group. No anastomotic leaks or deaths occurred in the series.

Conclusion

Postoperative CPAP/BiPAP can be safely omitted in laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients with known OSA, provided they are observed in a monitored setting and their pulmonary status is optimized by aggressive incentive spirometry and early ambulation.

### Causes of failure of noninvasive mechanical ventilation [^116Ga1iX]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

With selected patients noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) can obviate endotracheal intubation and thus avoid the airway trauma and infection associated with intubation. With patients who can cooperate, NPPV is the first-line treatment for mild-to-severe acute hypercapnic respiratory failure. NPPV is also used for hypercapnic ventilatory failure and to assist weaning from mechanical ventilation, by allowing earlier extubation. Some patients do not obtain adequate ventilation with NPPV and therefore require intubation. Also, some patients will initially benefit from NPPV (for one-to-several days) but will then deteriorate and require intubation. It is not always apparent which patients will initially benefit from NPPV, so researchers have been looking for variables that predict NPPV success/failure. The reported NPPV failure rate is 5–40%, so the necessary staff and equipment for prompt intubation should be readily available. Absolute contraindications to NPPV are: cardiac or respiratory arrest; nonrespiratory organ failure (eg, severe encephalopathy, severe gastrointestinal bleeding, hemodynamic instability with or without unstable cardiac angina); facial surgery or trauma; upper-airway obstruction; inability to protect the airway and/or high risk of aspiration; and inability to clear secretions. The NPPV training and experience of the clinician team partly determines whether the patient will succeed with NPPV or, instead, require intubation. Greater clinician-team NPPV experience and expertise are associated with a higher percentage of patients succeeding on NPPV and with NPPV success with sicker patients (than will succeed with a less-experienced clinician team). With patients suffering hypercapnic respiratory failure the best NPPV success/failure predictor is the degree of acidosis/acidemia (pH and P(aCO(2)) at admission and after 1 hour on NPPV), whereas mental status and severity of illness are less reliable predictors. With patients suffering hypoxic respiratory failure the likelihood of NPPV success seems to be related to the underlying disease rather than to the degree of hypoxia. For example, the presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome or community-acquired pneumonia portends NPPV failure, as does lack of oxygenation improvement after an hour on NPPV. All the proposed NPPV success/failure predictors should be used cautiously and need further study. We predict that further study and team experience will improve the NPPV success rate and allow successful NPPV-treatment of sicker patients.

### Predictors of outcome of noninvasive ventilation in severe COPD exacerbation [^114aVQCm]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Non-invasive ventilation

Initiation and management of NIV were done according to an internal protocol compliant with international guidelines. In brief, non-invasive ventilation was instituted in patients which despite one hour of intensive medical treatment comprising controlled oxygen therapy, inhaled bronchodilators and systemic steroids, fulfilled one of the following criteria: pH lower than 7.35 with pCO 2 higher than 47 mmHg; dyspnoea at rest with respiratory rate higher than 23 breaths/min; use of accessory respiratory muscles or paradoxical abdominal breathing. Exclusion criteria were: refusal of NIV, deep hypercapnic coma; facial deformity; upper gastrointestinal bleeding; tracheal stenosis; acute ischemic heart disease; psychomotor agitation requiring sedation or need for urgent intubation due to cardiac or respiratory arrest.

Patients were ventilated with Trilogy A100 (Phillips Respironics, Murrysville, Pennsylvania, USA) using full face or oro-nasal masks. The following ventilator settings were initially used: BPAP S/T AVAPS mode with IPAP min/max 16/30cmH 2 O, EPAP 6–8cmH 2 O, respiratory back-up rate of 16/min, target volume of 5–7 ml/kg. Adjustments of these parameters were made by the treating physician based on blood gas measurements, oximetry, patient tolerance, and patient-ventilator synchrony, according to our internal NIV protocol. NIV was initially administered as long as necessary to maintain a stable pH of ≥ 7.35, followed by a gradual decrease of NIV usage time over the following days. NIV weaning success was defined as the lack of need for NIV for more than 48 h. NIV failure was defined as either endotracheal intubation or in-hospital death.

mIPAP and hours/duration of NIV were automatically recorded by the ventilator and digitally analyzed using Direct View software (Phillips Respironics, Murrysville, Pennsylvania, USA). We have derived from these recordings the number of hours of NIV in the first 24, 48 and 72 h (i.e. dNIV-24 h, dNIV-48 h and dNIV-72 h), the number of days with NIV (i.e. days of NIV) and the mean inspiratory pressure attained by the ventilator in VAPS-BPAP mode during the first 72 h (i.e. mIPAP-72 h).

Sedation and airway protection — pre-procedure considerations for NVUGIB indicate that the method of sedation and the need for airway protection are important, and patients with suspected ongoing or massive NVUGIB, active hematemesis, or suspected retained gastric contents should undergo endotracheal intubation to decrease aspiration risk. Therapeutic upper endoscopes, which have a larger working channel that accommodate 10F accessories and enable improved suction of retained gastric contents and blood clots, may be preferred in severe bleeding.

### Consensus recommendations for managing patients with nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^117Fzesk]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The management of patients with acute nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding has evolved substantially over the past 10 years amid a paucity of published consensus guidelines.

Purpose

To provide evidence-based management recommendations that address clinically relevant issues. REVIEW AND CONSENSUS PROCESSES: A multidisciplinary consensus group of 25 voting participants representing 11 national societies used a 7-step approach to develop recommendation statements according to accepted standards. Sources of data included narrative and systematic reviews as well as published and new meta-analyses. The quality of the evidence, the strength of the recommendation, and the level of consensus were graded according to recognized classifications.

Main Findings

Recommendations emphasize appropriate initial resuscitation of the patient and a multidisciplinary approach to clinical risk stratification that determines the need for early endoscopy. Early endoscopy allows safe and prompt discharge of selected patients classified as low risk. Endoscopic hemostasis is reserved for patients with high-risk endoscopic lesions. Although monotherapy with injection or thermal coagulation is effective, the combination is superior to either treatment alone. The placement of endoscopic clips for endoscopic hemostasis appears promising. High-dose intravenous proton-pump inhibition is recommended in patients who have undergone successful endoscopic therapy. Routine second-look endoscopy is not recommended. Patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding should be tested for Helicobacter pylori infection and receive eradication therapy if infection is present.

Future Directions

The efficacy of newer endoscopic therapeutic technologies, the optimal regimen of proton-pump inhibition, and the roles of other pharmacologic agents require further research.

### How would you manage this patient with nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^1176xQkE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding is common, morbid, and potentially fatal. Cornerstones of inpatient management include fluid resuscitation; blood transfusion; endoscopy; and initiation of proton-pump inhibitor therapy, which continues in an individualized manner based on risk factors for recurrent bleeding in the outpatient setting. The International Consensus Group released guidelines on the management of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding in 2019. These guidelines provide a helpful, evidence-based roadmap for management of gastrointestinal bleeding but leave certain management details to the discretion of the treating physician. Here, 2 gastroenterologists consider the care of a patient with nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding from a peptic ulcer, specifically debating approaches to blood transfusion and endoscopy timing in the hospital, as well as the recommended duration of proton-pump inhibitor therapy after discharge.

A lack of consensus exists in the pre-endoscopic risk stratification of patients with upper or lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The work by Das and colleagues in the previous issue of Critical Care serves to externally validate the BLEED criteria. Their results suggest that hemodynamically stable patients without evidence of ongoing bleeding or unstable comorbidities may be at lower risk for hospital complications. While their results reinforce previous studies, further investigation is needed before comprehensive practice guidelines can be established.

Materials and methods

Patients' selection, management, and randomization

The study was carried out over a 12-month period in a single center of a 24-bed adult general ICU in a University Hospital. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of São Paulo and was registered under ISRCTN number 41524441. It was performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained before extubation from the closest next-of-kin for each patient. Inclusion criteria: patients with acute respiratory failure (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio ≤ 300 or PaCO 2 ≥ 50 mm Hg at intubation); invasive mechanical ventilation for a period longer than 72 hours administered by orotracheal tube; weaning from invasive mechanical ventilation by using the ICU weaning protocol; absence of contraindications for the use of NIV, which were defined as: cardiac or respiratory arrest, severe encephalopathy (Glasgow coma scale < 10), bleeding of the upper gastrointestinal tract, hemodynamic instability or severe arrhythmia, facial surgery or trauma or deformity, severe upper-airway obstruction, inability to cooperate or protect the airways, inability to cough or clear respiratory secretions, absence of a gag reflex, and severe gastric distention. Exclusion criteria: younger than 18 years, pregnancy, and patient's refusal to participate in the study. We considered COPD patients those with any known history of underlying COPD, regardless of the etiology of respiratory failure.

Risk factors for clinically important stress-related UGIB — Recommendation 1 states: We suggest critically ill adults with coagulopathy, shock, or chronic liver disease be considered at risk for clinically important UGIB (conditional recommendation, low to moderate certainty of evidence). Supporting data after excluding studies with high risk of bias showed an increased absolute risk of stress-related UGIB of 4.8% (95% CI, 2.6–8.6%), 2.6% (95% CI, 1.2–5.4%), and 7.6% (95% CI, 3.3–17.6%) in patients with coagulopathy, shock, and chronic liver disease respectively; mechanical ventilation alone probably is not a risk factor and does not necessitate SUP, and no evidence is available for noninvasive ventilatory strategies. The panel describes risk as "at risk" (critically ill and presence of coagulopathy, shock, or chronic liver disease) versus "low-risk" (critically ill and absence of coagulopathy, shock, or chronic liver disease).

Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) — key concept statements for altered mentation and hepatic encephalopathy (HE) emphasize that in patients with grade 3 or 4 HE, care of the airway, evaluation of other causes of altered mental status, treatment of potential precipitating factors, and empiric HE therapy should occur simultaneously. Consideration for causes other than HE as the reasons for altered mental status is important, especially in patients who have not recovered after HE therapies are deployed. Careful monitoring for pain, delirium, and avoiding medications that prolong sedation are important in promoting a return to consciousness. Discussion of goals of care should occur with patients before the onset of alteration in mental status and should continue afterward. Patients need to be monitored after they return to consciousness for critical care–related post-traumatic stress. Ventilation in the absence of altered mental status should not be considered brain failure.

### Management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: an updated ACG guideline [^112K37Q7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) — initial assessment and stabilization: A focused history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation should be obtained at the time of patient presentation to assess the severity of bleeding and its possible location and etiology, and initial patient assessment and hemodynamic resuscitation should be performed simultaneously. Patients with hemodynamic instability and/or suspected ongoing bleeding should receive intravenous fluid resuscitation with the goal of optimization of blood pressure and heart rate before endoscopic evaluation/ intervention. Hematochezia associated with hemodynamic instability may be indicative of an UGIB source, and an upper endoscopy should be performed if the suspicion is high to exclude a proximal source of bleeding. Endoscopic hemostasis can be considered safe and effective in patients who have an INR of 2.5 or less. Platelets should be administered in the setting of severe LGIB to maintain a platelet count of > 30 × 10^9/L, and a higher threshold of > 50 × 10^9/L can be considered if endoscopic procedures are required, and there is no benefit to routine platelet transfusion for patients on antiplatelets.

### Effect of positive airway pressure on obese patients undergoing surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1118e8ah]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis (SRMA) evaluates the efficacy and safety of Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) therapy in perioperative care for obese surgical patients. We reviewed 24 studies, encompassing data up to March 23, 2023, analyzing the impacts of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) and Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BIPAP) on postoperative adverse outcomes, oxygenation, and pulmonary function. Our findings underscore the significant potential of PAP therapy in managing obese patients during the perioperative period, particularly those at substantial risk for postoperative respiratory complications. PAP therapy not only enhances oxygenation levels and lung function but also substantially reduces the incidence of atelectasis and shortens hospital stays, thereby affirming its vital role in improving perioperative outcomes for this patient population.

Noninvasive ventilation (continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP] and bilevel positive airway pressure [BiPAP]) in acute heart failure — In a study of 89 consecutive elderly patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (PaO2/ FIO2 ≤ 300), CPAP reduced the need for ventilatory assistance and early 48-hour mortality compared with standard oxygen with no difference in hospital length of stay. Specifically, the need for ventilatory assistance was 17% less (P = 0.01) in the CPAP group (7%) compared to standard oxygen (24%), and early 48-hour mortality was 21% less (P = 0.017) in the CPAP group (9%) compared to standard oxygen (30%). Evidence for BiPAP was mixed: in a 2000 trial of 37 patients, intubation was significantly less with BiPAP (5% versus 33%; P = 0.04) with faster symptom resolution defined by oxygen saturation ≥ 96% and respiratory rate < 30 breaths/min, whereas a 1997 trial halted after enrollment of 27 patients found higher myocardial infarction in the BiPAP group (71%, N = 10, P = 0.06) versus CPAP (31%, N = 4) with extremely large 95% confidence intervals (9% to 76%). Additional studies showed no clear superiority or differences: an out-of-hospital comparison reported BiPAP was associated with increased intubation, myocardial infarction, and a combined endpoint within 24 hours; a 2001 convenience sample of 38 randomized to BiPAP or conventional oxygen found no statistically significant differences in heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygenation, rate of intubation, hospital length of stay, or myocardial infarction; a 2002 crossover study of 6 patients sequentially receiving CPAP 5 mm Hg, CPAP 10 mm Hg, and BiPAP 10/5 mm Hg found no significant difference in oxygenation or hemodynamic response; and a 2004 randomized head-to-head trial of 46 patients comparing CPAP 10 mm Hg to BiPAP 15/5 mm Hg found no differences in myocardial infarction, intubation, or inhospital mortality.

Methods

This was a retrospective study performed in a respiratory ICU of a teaching hospital. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University (No. K2024–061–01). As the retrospective design, the informed consent was waived. Patients who admitted to our ICU between 2011 and 2019 were screened. The inclusion criteria were hypoxemia, use of NIV as a first-line therapy, and PaCO 2 ≤ 45 mmHg before the use of NIV. The exclusion criteria were PaCO 2 > 45 mmHg before the use of NIV, heart failure as the primary reason for NIV, and presence of acute-on-chronic respiratory failure. And those patients with missing data were also excluded. In addition, some patients received high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) after 2017. The use of NIV or HFNC was determined by the attending physicians based on their experience and the availability of the device.

Patients admitted to our ICU were managed following hospital protocols. In our department, the dedicated noninvasive ventilator was used for all patients. The indications for NIV were as follows: (1) tachypnea (respiratory rate > 25 breaths/min), (2) clinical presentation of respiratory distress at rest (such as active contraction of the accessory inspiratory muscles or paradoxical abdominal motion), or (3) PaO 2 < 60 mmHg at room air or PaO 2 /FiO 2 < 300 mmHg with supplemental oxygen. If supplemental oxygen was used, FiO 2 was estimated as follows: FiO 2 (%) = 21 + 4×fow (L/min). The contraindications for NIV were as follows: (1) facial or nasal abnormalities, (2) recent gastric or esophageal surgery, (3) active upper gastrointestinal bleeding, (4) high risk for aspiration, (5) unable to clear sputum, (6) hemodynamic instability without response to fluids or vasoactive agents, and (7) lack of cooperation. However, the use of NIV was at the physician's discretion.

The literature is "insufficient" to evaluate perioperative impact of CPAP, NIPPV, mandibular advancement devices, medications, or weight loss, although "the literature supports the efficacy of CPAP in improving AHI, respiratory disturbance index scores, and oxygen saturation levels in nonperioperative settings", and similarly supports mandibular advancement devices "in reducing AHI scores in nonperoperative settings". The consultants agree that "preoperative use of positive airway pressure (CPAP or NIPPV) may improve the preoperative condition of patients who they believe are at increased perioperative risk from OSA", and they are "equivocal regarding the efficacy of mandibular advancement devices for these patients".

### Biphasic positive airway pressure or continuous positive airway pressure: a randomized trial [^111M4wEY]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There is currently no clear evidence that nasal-biphasic positive airway pressure (n-BiPAP) confers any advantage over nasal-continuous positive airway pressure (n-CPAP). Our hypothesis was that preterm infants born before 30 weeks' gestation and < 2 weeks old when extubated onto n-BiPAP will have a lower risk of extubation failure than infants extubated onto n-CPAP at equivalent mean airway pressure.

Methods

We conducted an unblinded multicenter randomized trial comparing n-CPAP with n-BiPAP in infants born < 30 weeks' gestation and < 2 weeks old. The primary outcome variable was the rate of extubation failure within 48 hours after the first attempt at extubation. Block randomization stratified by center and gestation (< 28 weeks or ≥ 28 weeks) was performed.

Results

A total of 540 infants (270 in each group) were eligible to be included in the statistical analysis; 57 (21%) of n-BiPAP group and 55 (20%) of n-CPAP group failed extubation at 48 hours postextubation (adjusted odds ratio 1.01; 95% confidence interval 0.65–1.56; p = 0.97). Subgroup analysis of infants born before and after 28 weeks' gestation showed no significant differences between the 2 groups. There were no significant differences between arms in death; oxygen requirement at 28 days; oxygen requirement at 36 weeks' corrected gestation; or intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis requiring surgery, or pneumothorax.

Conclusions

This trial shows that there is no added benefit to using n-BIPAP over n-CPAP at equivalent mean airway pressure in preventing extubation failures in infants born before 30 weeks' gestation and < 2 weeks old.

Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) brain failure — For patients with severe hepatic encephalopathy, simultaneous airway care, evaluation for other causes, treatment of precipitants, and empiric therapy are emphasized; clinicians should consider non-HE causes if recovery is delayed, avoid prolonged sedation, discuss goals of care early and continue afterward, monitor for post-traumatic stress after recovery of consciousness, and note that ventilation without altered mental status is not brain failure. Key statements include: "In patients with grade 3 or 4 HE, care of the airway, evaluation of other causes of altered mental status, treatment of potential precipitating factors, and empiric HE therapy should occur simultaneously", "Consideration for causes other than HE as the reasons for altered mental status is important, especially in patients who have not recovered after HE therapies are deployed", "Careful monitoring of pain, delirium, and avoiding medications that prolong sedation are important in allowing for return to consciousness", "Discussion of goals of care should ideally occur with patients before the onset of alteration in mental status and should continue afterward", "Patients need to be monitored after they return to consciousness for critical care–related post-traumatic stress", and "Ventilation in the absence of altered mental status should not be considered brain failure".

### Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) versus nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) for apnea of prematurity [^111aZXwh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Apnea of prematurity is almost universal in infants who are born before 34 weeks gestation. Previous randomised trials and systematic reviews have found methylxanthines to be effective in preventing apnea of prematurity. However, recent concerns about potential long term side effects of methylxanthines on the neurodevelopment of low birth weight infants have led to an increased interest in alternate methods of treating apnea of prematurity. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) is a useful method of respiratory support which reduces the incidence of obstructive or mixed apnea. However, apneic infants managed with NCPAP, with or without methylxanthines, sometimes require endotracheal intubation with its attendant morbidity and cost. Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is a simple, effective mode of respiratory support for older children and adults. It has been used to treat apnea in preterm infants but case reports of gastrointestinal perforations have limited its widespread use.

Objectives

In preterm infants with recurrent apnea, does treatment with NIPPV lead to a greater reduction in apnea and need for intubation and mechanical ventilation, as compared with treatment with NCPAP? Does NIPPV increase the incidence of gastrointestinal complications, i.e.g.astric distension leading to cessation of feeds, or perforation?

Search Strategy

MEDLINE was searched (1966-Oct week 2, 2001). Other sources included the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library, Disk Issue 3, 2001) and CINAHL (1982-Sept week 4, 2001). Also used were expert informants, previous reviews including cross-references, and conference and symposia proceedings.

Selection Criteria

All randomised and quasi-randomised trials were included. Participants included unventilated preterm infants experiencing apnea of prematurity. Interventions compared were intermittent positive pressure ventilation administered via the nasal route, either by short nasal prongs or nasopharyngeal tube, and nasal CPAP delivered by the same methods. Types of outcome measures: - failure of therapy as defined by apnea that is frequent or severe requiring additional ventilatory support - rates of endotracheal intubation - rates of apnea and bradycardia expressed as events per hour - gastrointestinal complications i.e. abdominal distension requiring cessation of feeds, or GI perforation

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by the three reviewers. The trials were analysed using relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat (NNT) for dichotomous data; means and weighted mean difference (WMD) were used for continuous data.

Main Results

Two trials, enrolling 54 infants in total, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Both reported only the short term results (4 to 6 hours) of the interventions. Only one infant (randomised to NCPAP) required intubation during this period. Ryan (1989), in a cross over study of 20 infants, showed no significant difference in rates of apnea (events/hr) between the 2 interventions [WMD -0.10 (-0.53,0.33)]. Lin (1998) randomised 34 infants and demonstrated a greater reduction in frequency of apneas (events/hr) with NIPPV compared to NCPAP [WMD -1.19 (-2.31,-0.07)]. Meta-analysis of both trials showed no difference in pCO2 (mmHg) at the end of the 4–6 hour study period [WMD 0.95 (-3.05,4.94)]. No data were reported on gastrointestinal complications.

Implications For Practice

NIPPV may be a useful method of augmenting the beneficial effects of NCPAP in preterm infants with apnea that is frequent or severe. Its use appears to reduce the frequency of apneas more effectively than NCPAP. Additional safety and efficacy data are required before recommending NIPPV as standard therapy for apnea.

Implications For Research

Future trials with sufficient power should assess the efficacy (reduction in failure of therapy) and safety (GI complications) of NIPPV. Outcomes should be assessed throughout the entire period during which the infant requires assisted ventilation. The recent ability to synchronise NIPPV with an infant's spontaneous respirations is a promising development requiring further assessment.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fifth edition [^116BfZNn]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Tracheal intubation of severely injured patients is a delicate procedure that involves risks and requires skill and proper training of the operator. The fundamental objective of intubation is to ensure adequate ventilation and oxygenation and to guarantee the patency of the airway. There are well-defined situations in which intubation is mandatory, for example, in the presence of airway obstruction, altered consciousness [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) ≤ 8], haemorrhagic shock, hypoventilation or hypoxaemia; however, other aspects should also be considered. For example, the introduction of positive pressure can induce potentially life-threatening hypotension in hypovolaemic patients, and some authors have reported increased mortality associated with pre-hospital intubation.

Several factors influence the success of intubation and therefore patient prognosis. Rapid sequence induction appears to be the best method; however, several aspects remain to be clarified, such as who is best suited to make the decision to intubate, which drugs and which rescue device to use and the ideal infrastructure of emergency services. Most of the available data come from retrospective studies, which are open to bias; therefore, controversy remains about the appropriate use of tracheal intubation in patients following traumatic injury.

The negative effects of hypoxaemia are well known, particularly in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI); therefore, high oxygen concentrations are generally targeted during the initial management of these patients to ensure oxygen delivery to ischaemic areas. Some studies, however, have suggested that prolonged hyperoxia is associated with increased mortality. A recent meta-analysis based on high-quality evidence showed that prolonged liberal oxygen therapy in acutely ill adults increased mortality without improving other patient-important outcomes. Extreme hyperoxia (PaO 2 > 487 mmHg [> 65 kPa]) should therefore be avoided in patients with TBI. Another recent study showed that the mortality increase was related to the duration and extent of hyperoxia. On the other hand, mechanical ventilation using settings that targeted an oxygen saturation of 88–92% compared with > 95% did not negatively influence survival in critical care patients. The negative effects of hyperoxia are likely related to altered microcirculation associated with high PaO 2 and increased production of oxygen-free radicals and patients with severe brain injury may be at particular risk. Therefore, although hyperoxia may increase the oxygen content and delivery in an extremely anaemic trauma patient and be associated with a benefit in this specific situation, hyperoxia should be returned to normoxia as soon as the haemoglobin (Hb) level allows.

### Recent advances on the management of patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^1116a8o1]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Considerations

All patients should be assessed for evidence of hemodynamic compromise and low hemoglobin levels. The decision to transfuse should take into account the hemoglobin level, but practitioners should keep in mind that transfusion may carry the risks of complications. This decision should be weighed carefully for each individual patient. As common sense dictates, hypovolemic patients with acute massive blood loss who may only show a spuriously small drop in hemoglobin on presentation should be managed proactively according to the hemoglobin levels that are anticipated to show following volume resuscitation. Similarly, a higher target level of hemoglobin should be pursued in patients who have low tolerance to anemia because of comorbidities such as coronary artery disease, cardiac or renal failure. More research is necessary before sound recommendations can be made about the hemoglobin threshold for transfusion and the target hemoglobin levels.

Risk stratification, management of co-morbidities, and time to endoscopy

Many patients who experience upper GI bleeding have other medical co-morbidities which can affect their outcomes. Anticoagulation, in particular, is a treatment for many medical conditions, and recent guidelines recommend reversal of coagulopathy when it is identified. They make note, however, that reversal should not delay endoscopy.

There exists general consensus that patients presenting with upper GI bleeding should be considered for risk-stratification using an evidence-based scoring system such as the Rockall score or the Blatchford score. The two scores differ in their clinical predictions. The complete (post-endoscopy) Rockall score predicts the occurrence of rebleeding and mortality, and those patients who are at low risk for rebleeding and death can be safely discharged after endoscopy. The Blatchford score can be completed prior to endoscopy and predicts the need for intervention. There are no guidelines that recommend one particular risk-assessment score, though the NICE guidelines recommend performing the Blatchford score at first assessment and the complete Rockall score after endoscopy. NICE performed a rigorous systematic review and meta-analysis on the prognostic accuracy of these scoring systems. Both of them have higher sensitivity than specificity and therefore are mainly useful for ruling out high risk patients. The Blatchford score is extremely sensitive (99–100%), but the quality of evidence for this result is "low" according to Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE); the Rockall is slightly less sensitive (98%), but the quality of evidence for this is somehow better ("moderate" according to GRADE).

### Risk factors for patient-important upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^115Mjn9V]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Patient-important gastrointestinal bleeding is an endpoint developed by patients and family members; however, risk factors for this outcome are unknown.

Objective

To identify risk factors for patient-important upper gastrointestinal bleeding among invasively ventilated adults.

Methods

This pre-planned regression analysis of an international trial database evaluated baseline and time-varying risk factors in the preceding 3 days for patient-important upper gastrointestinal bleeding, accounting for illness severity and the competing risk of death.

Measurements and Main Results

Patient-important upper gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in the ICU among 131 of 4,821 (2.7%) patients. Baseline APACHE II score (Hazard Ratio [HR] 1.24 [95%CI 1.12, 1.37] per 5-point increase), and the following were associated with greater risk of patient-important bleeding: inotropes or vasopressors (HR 2.05 [1.35, 3.12]), severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 50 × 10 9 /L) (HR 2.21 [1.24, 3.94]) and platelet inhibitor drugs (HR 1.69 [1.11, 2.56]). A lower bleeding risk was associated with pantoprazole (HR 0.36 [0.25, 0.54]) and enteral nutrition (HR 0.81 [0.68, 0.97]) for every 500 mL/day increase. There was no interaction between enteral nutrition and pantoprazole (interaction p value = 0.94). Allocation to pantoprazole was associated with a lower risk of patient-important upper gastrointestinal bleeding irrespective of the volume of enteral nutrition (HR 0.36 [0.22, 0.58] for 500ml/day, and HR 0.36 [0.18, 0.72] for no enteral nutrition). The association of enteral nutrition and bleeding was similar with pantoprazole (HR 0.82 [0.63, 1.07]) or without pantoprazole (HR 0.81 [0.66, 1.00]).

Several factors are associated with the risk of patient-important upper gastrointestinal bleeding during invasive ventilation.

### A novel non-invasive method to detect excessively high respiratory effort and dynamic transpulmonary driving pressure during mechanical ventilation [^115xzYbr]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

This study was conducted in two medical-surgical intensive care units at the University Health Network, Toronto, Canada. The findings presented in this paper represent an ancillary analysis on an ongoing clinical study (MYOTRAUMA, NCT03108118) characterizing diaphragm activity and function longitudinally during mechanical ventilation. Informed consent was obtained from substitute decision makers prior to enrolment. If no substitute decision maker was available, eligible patients were enrolled by deferred consent and consent for the use of study data was obtained from study participants once they regained capacity. The Research Ethics Board at University Health Network approved the study protocols, and the study was performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 2008 Declaration of Helsinki. The study findings were validated in a dataset collected from a previously published cohort of patients in China.

Study subjects

Patients were enrolled in the MYOTRAUMA study if they were intubated for fewer than 36 h and if the reason for intubation was one of acute brain injury (i.e. stroke or traumatic brain injury), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, or pneumonia. Patients were excluded if they were deemed unlikely to remain on the ventilator for at least 7 days, if there was a contraindication to esophageal catheterization (recent upper GI surgery, bleeding varices), or if they had a concomitant acute exacerbation of obstructive airways disease. Recordings obtained in MYOTRAUMA study subjects were included from days when the subjects were breathing spontaneously (triggering the ventilator).

### The open abdomen, indications, management and definitive closure [^112L5Sck]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Diagnosis and treatment

The role of elevated IAP is fundamental in understanding the evolution from IAH to ACS. Basing on the different patients and the setting into which they are admitted the measurement of IAP can be less or more helpful but in any case it remains a cornerstone. Recently Starkopf et al. found that the risk of IAH in mechanically ventilated patients is very low especially if they have a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) < 10 cm H2O, PaO2/FiO2 > 300 and BMI < 30 kg/m2 and without pancreatitis, hepatic failure/cirrhosis with ascites, gastrointestinal bleeding or laparotomy and the use of vasopressor/inotropes at admission. In all those patients with the aforementioned characteristics the measurement of IAP might be considered.

According to the World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome 2013 consensus guidelines, IAP should be measured when there are at least 2 known risk factor for IAH/ACS in critically ill or injured patients. Serial measurements should be performed during the patient's critical illness, preferably every 4–6 h. To measure the IAP the bladder pressure is considered the gold standard and should be taken at end-expiration with the patient supine and the transducer zeroed at the midaxillary line after an instillation of saline into the bladder. Another option available, if the bladder pressure is contraindicated (due to a constitutive augmented bladder pressure, e.g. in pelvic hematoma), is the measurement with the stomach technique. Moreover exist the possibility to measure the intra-abdominal pressure via rectal, vaginal, inferior vena cava and direct intra-peritoneal measurement.

In treating patients with IAH, key principles include: optimization of systemic perfusion and organ function, institution of specific medical procedures to reduce IAP, and prompt surgical decompressive laparotomy for refractory IAH. Great emphasis has been placed on prevention, with early, prompt haemostatic control, aggressive balancing of resuscitation to include abundant coagulation factors. Tailoring the response for individual patients is essential to ensure that optimal outcomes are achieved. Further measures to alleviate IAH include sedation, analgesia, and neuromuscular blockade can be used to decrease IAP. Is it has been shown that persistent IAH of > 18 mmHg is an independent cause of renal failure in general surgical patients admitted to ICU.

When employing early goal-directed fluid resuscitation is crucial to remember that correction of hypovolemia must be balanced carefully to avoid an iatrogenic secondary abdominal compartment syndrome. The keys in the end are prompt return to status quo, hemorrhage control, eradication of sepsis, removal of fluid either by percutaneous catheter drainage and finally decompression.

The established quality indicators for early management of upper gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage are based on rapid diagnosis, risk stratification, and early management. Effective preendoscopic treatment may improve survivability of critically ill patients and improve resource allocation for all patients. Accurate risk stratification helps determine the need for hospital admission, hemodynamic monitoring, blood transfusion, and endoscopic hemostasis before esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) via indirect measures such as laboratory studies, physiologic data, and comorbidities. Early management before the definitive EGD is essential to improving outcomes for patients with upper GI bleeding.

### British society of gastroenterology (BSG)-led multisociety consensus care bundle for the early clinical management of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^116qgYkF]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

We recommend that patients with AUGIB with ongoing haemodynamic instability are referred for critical care review

Level of evidence: Very low

Level of recommendation: Strong

Agreement: 100%

Bundle recommendation: If haemodynamically unstable, consider activating major haemorrhage protocol and arranging critical care review (added as standalone statement in bundle)

The study by Baradarian et al associated intensive monitoring and management of haemodynamic instability with improved outcomes. Patients with AUGIB may also suffer complications caused by non-hypovolaemic causes of shock, for example, sepsis in patients with cirrhosis. Haemodynamic instability per se should not be the sole determinant for critical care admission. In cases of ongoing haemodynamic instability despite adequate resuscitative efforts, activation of the major haemorrhage protocol should be considered in addition to early referral to a critical care specialist in order to optimise circulatory management.

We suggest that platelets should be given in active AUGIB with a platelet count ≤ 50 × 10 9 /L, as per major haemorrhage protocols

Level of evidence: Very low

Level of recommendation: Weak

Agreement: 90%

Bundle recommendation: Keep platelet count > 50 (included as part of major haemorrhage protocol, therefore no separate statement required)

No RCTs have assessed the role of platelet transfusions or platelet transfusion thresholds. There is little evidence for the effectiveness of platelet transfusions or the optimal dose when a patient with a thrombocytopenia is actively bleeding. In patients without pre-existing thrombocytopenia, acquired thrombocytopenia may be a late event in major haemorrhage, occurring after blood loss of at least 1.5 total blood volumes. Guidance for a platelet transfusion threshold in major bleeding is based on expert opinion only, and is consistently recommended by NICEand the British Society for Haematology. Due to the limited evidence and its coverage within the major haemorrhage protocol, a separate bundle statement for thrombocytopaenia correction was not included.

American Thoracic Society ARDS guideline — systemic corticosteroids: We suggest using corticosteroids for patients with ARDS (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence). In randomized controlled trials (RCTs), corticosteroids were evaluated in 19 RCTs including 2,790 patients and probably decrease mortality (n = 17 studies; RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73–0.96; moderate certainty). Corticosteroids may reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of hospital stay, but the effect on the length of ICU stay is uncertain. Safety signals include that corticosteroids probably increase the risk of serious hyperglycemia (n = 6 studies; RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01–1.23; moderate certainty), may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 5 studies; RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.43–3.34; low certainty), and have an uncertain effect on neuromuscular weakness (n = 2 studies; RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.62–1.18; very low certainty).

Table 2 — evidenced-based algorithm for initial management of suspected portal hypertensive bleeding specifies to ensure adequate vascular access with 2 large-bore peripheral intravenous cannulae or central venous access and provide fluid resuscitation with colloid or crystalloid, and to assess airway protection with tracheal intubation advised for active hematemesis, inability to maintain or protect airway, and to enable optimal sedation for endoscopic therapy. Vasoactive therapy includes octreotide initial intravenous bolus of 50 μg (can be repeated in first hour if ongoing bleeding) followed by continuous intravenous infusion of octreotide 50 μg/h for 2–5 d (may stop after definitive hemostasis achieved), and somatostatin analogs inhibit gastric acid secretion so co-administration of proton pump inhibitor is not required. Antibiotic prophylaxis is emphasized, with intravenous ceftriaxone 1 g/24 h (maximal duration 7 d) since prophylactic antibiotics reduce infections, rebleeding, and mortality. A restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy is outlined: transfuse at Hgb threshold of 7 g/dL and goal maintenance Hgb of 7–9 g/dL, with restrictive transfusion associated with favorable effect on hepatic venous pressure gradient, decreased mortality, and decreased rate for early rebleeding; avoid overuse of blood products in cirrhosis given risks including precipitation of portal venous thrombosis. Urgent endoscopic assessment for source control should follow stabilization, within 12 h of presentation, and consider erythromycin before emergency endoscopy (250 mg intravenous, 30–120 min before) to optimize visualization with QT interval check; patients with acute variceal hemorrhage should be managed within the intensive care unit or other well-monitored units given mortality risk and care complexity.

We retrospectively analyzed patients admitted to the trauma intensive care unit at a level 1 trauma center from 3/2019 to 7/2023. We included patients mechanically ventilated for > 48 hours. Patients with GiB were matched (1:3) by age to control patients for case-control analysis. We compared demographics, management, and outcomes between cohorts. We conducted a conditional logistic regression to identify GiB predictors.

Results

We reviewed 2,289 patients and identified 64 with a GiB. After matching, 256 patients met the inclusion criteria. The overall population was male (77%) and had a median age of 41, an Injury Severity Score of 22, and a mortality of 21%. Of 64 patients with GiB, 48 (75%) were clinically significant. Male sex (AOR = 3.12, 95% CI 1.10–9.11, p = 0.04), vasopressor use (AOR = 3.16, 95% CI 1.25–8.02, p = 0.02), corticosteroid use (AOR = 2.45, 95% CI 1.06–5.67, p = 0.04), need for renal replacement therapy (AOR = 3.54, 95% CI 1.22–10.28, p = 0.02), and enteral nutrition intolerance (AOR = 3.86, 95% CI 1.49–9.99, p = 0.01) were all identified as independent predictors for GIB.

Conclusions

GiB remains a significant problem in critically ill populations. Identifying risk factors unique to the critical trauma patient may lead to earlier identification of susceptible patients and allow for more robust preventive measures to reduce incidence.

Using a flow driver to generate CPAP has the theoretical advantage of offloading expiratory work of breathing, although no important clinical differences have been shown in clinical trials among various CPAP devices. The simplicity of bubble CPAP systems allows their use in low-income settings with some evidence of benefit over free-flowing oxygen. Leaks between the interface and nose are common with both nasal prongs and masks but somewhat less with prongs. All CPAP interfaces carry risk of facial distortion and nasal trauma.

Bi-level CPAP, Duo-PAP, or BIPAP are variants between CPAP and IPPV that use low pressure differences between inspiratory and expiratory phases at PIPs of 9–11 cm H 2 O at rates of around 20–40 per minute with long inspiratory times of up to 1.0 s. There is no evidence that BIPAP confers any advantage over CPAP, and any clinical differences may simply reflect a higher overall mean airway pressure. Modern ventilators provide NIPPV using pressures similar to those used for invasive MV. Challenges of NIPPV relate to pressure delivery through a non-sealed system, which is limited by leak at the nasal interface and the infant's tolerance to gas inflation of the stomach. Ventilator inflations can be synchronised with the infant's breathing by using either an abdominal capsule or in-line sensors. Synchronisation of nasal ventilation further improves respiratory stability. Recent systematic reviews comparing different modes of NIV for primary respiratory support or post-extubation concluded that synchronised NIPPV was the most effective, decreasing the need for MV, or re-ventilation, in preterm infants.

### Resumen de las pruebas de espuma para los ventiladores… [^113aW8L1]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

En junio de 2021, Philips Respironics retiró determinados ventiladores, máquinas de presión positiva de dos niveles en las vías respiratorias y máquinas de presión positiva continua en las vías respiratorias debido a riesgos potenciales para la salud. La espuma de poliuretano con base de poliéster utilizada en estos dispositivos para reducir el ruido y las vibraciones puede romperse en pedazos. Si la espuma se rompe, la persona que utiliza el dispositivo podría inhalar o tragar trozos negros de espuma o determinadas sustancias químicas preocupantes, denominadas compuestos orgánicos volátiles, que no son visibles. No creemos que las pruebas y el análisis que Philips ha compartido hasta la fecha sean adecuados para evaluar plenamente los riesgos que los dispositivos retirados plantean a los usuarios.

Aunque Philips llegó a la conclusión de que es "improbable que la exposición a las partículas de espuma y a los COV de estos dispositivos provoque un daño apreciable para la salud de los pacientes", la FDA cree que es necesario realizar más pruebas. Philips ha accedido a realizar las pruebas adicionales solicitadas. Basándose en la información actualmente disponible, la FDA mantiene sus recomendaciones sobre los posibles riesgos para la salud asociados a la descomposición de la espuma de PE-PUR en estos dispositivos retirados. La FDA revisará cualquier información adicional proporcionada por Philips y continuará supervisando los informes sobre los dispositivos médicos para fundamentar mejor nuestro análisis en curso de los posibles riesgos para la salud. Mientras se realizan estas pruebas independientes de la espuma a base de silicona, la FDA recomienda a los pacientes que utilicen un dispositivo reparado o sustituido que continúen utilizando su producto.

La FDA ha llegado a esta determinación basándose en una evaluación global de beneficio-riesgo. En este momento, la agencia ha determinado que suspender el uso de uno de estos dispositivos puede ser más perjudicial para la salud y la calidad de vida del paciente. Los resultados de las pruebas independientes son necesarios para determinar si la espuma a base de silicona utilizada en los dispositivos reparados presenta realmente algún riesgo para los pacientes, y la FDA comunicará esos resultados al público tan pronto como estén disponibles.

### Actividades de la FDA relacionadas con los respiradores,… [^113nthBe]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

El 30 de junio de 2021, la FDA alertó a las personas que utilizan ciertos ventiladores Philips Respironics, máquinas de presión positiva de dos niveles en las vías respiratorias y máquinas de presión positiva continua en las vías respiratorias debido a posibles riesgos para la salud. Tras el retiro inicial en junio de 2021, Philips desarrolló un plan para sustituir la espuma de PE-PUR de los dispositivos CPAP y BiPAP retirados del mercado con una espuma diferente, basada en silicona. La FDA aprobó inicialmente este plan basándose, en parte, en las pruebas que la empresa facilitó a la FDA en junio de 2021 sobre la nueva espuma.

Sin embargo, durante la inspección de las instalaciones de fabricación, la FDA obtuvo información adicional, de la que la agencia no disponía anteriormente, relativa a la espuma a base de silicona utilizada en un dispositivo singular similar comercializado fuera de los EE. UU. que no superó una prueba de seguridad de la liberación de determinadas sustancias químicas preocupantes, denominadas compuestos orgánicos volátiles. Las mascarillas retiradas tienen imanes y pueden causar lesiones potenciales o la muerte cuando el uso de la mascarilla con imanes interfiere con determinados dispositivos médicos metálicos implantados u objetos metálicos en el cuerpo. El 29 de agosto de 2022, la FDA emitió un comunicado de seguridad para alertar a pacientes, cuidadores y profesionales de atención médica de que Philips retiró del mercado máquinas BiPAP que pueden contener un plástico contaminado con un material no compatible.

Esto puede ocurrir si el flujo de oxígeno está parcialmente bloqueado por cualquier motivo. Si el proveedor de asistencia médica no resuelve el problema que causa la presión máxima del sistema, el ventilador continuará proporcionando al paciente un caudal de oxígeno inferior y emitirá una alarma de prioridad baja.

Intravascular fluid overload can cause elevated central venous pressure, potentially leading to poor renal perfusion and subsequent acute kidney injury while extravascular edema compromises abdominal and thoracic compliance and can make ventilation difficult. In the post-operative period, fluid overload has been associated with significant morbidity including AKI, longer mechanical ventilation dependence, prolonged length of stay, and increased mortality.

### CPAP or BiPAP for motion mitigation during radiotherapy (SISTER) [^114DpZ73]. ClinicalTrials (2021). Medium credibility.

CPAP or BiPAP for Motion Mitigation During Radiotherapy ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview When using highly conformal radiotherapy techniques, such as proton therapy, a controlled breathing pattern and a minimal breathing amplitude could greatly benefit the treatment of mobile tumors. This reduction in tumor motion may be achieved with the use of a ventilator that is able to regulate and modulate the breathing pattern. CPAP provides a constant level of positive airway pressure. Compared to spontaneous breathing, the use of CPAP increased lung volume and can result in a significant decrease in tumor movement and a significant decrease in both mean lung and mean heart radiation dose. These results were found in patients treated for limited stage disease, it is not clear if this approach is feasible for patients with more advanced stage of disease that undergo radiotherapy with curative intent.

With Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure, tidal volume excursions are determined by the pressure difference between the set inspiratory positive airway pressure and the set expiratory positive airway pressure. This mode of ventilation increases lung volume comparable to CPAP, but also to control tidal volumes and breathing frequency. However, BiPAP has never been studied in the setting of motion mitigation during radiotherapy and BiPAP might be more difficult to adjust to for patients compared to CPAP. Therefore, the current study is proposed to evaluate whether or not CPAP or BiPAP is of benefit in patients that undergo radiotherapy for larger intra-thoracic tumor volumes. The study will follow a 2-step approach. First, the feasibility of short-term use of CPAP and BiPAP and its effects on lung volumes, tidal volumes and breathing frequency will be investigated in patients with intra-thoracic tumors who are planned for radiotherapy.

This is necessary to select the best setting of CPAP or BiPAP with which minimal tumor motion is expected. In the second phase, the particular setting found in fase 1 is investigated: weekly repeated radiotherapy planning CT scans with and without CPAP/BiPAP will be aquired to evaluate the influence on tumor motion and dose to the target and organs at risk. Radiotherapy will be deliverd according to local protocol without the use of CPAP/BiPAP. Device: CPAP

### Ventiladores, Máquinas BiPAP y Máquinas CPAP de philips… [^116FyMgd]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

En junio de 2021, Philips Respironics retiró del mercado ciertos ventiladores, máquinas de presión positiva de dos niveles en las vías respiratorias y máquinas de presión positiva continua en las vías respiratorias debido a posibles riesgos para la salud. La espuma de poliuretano a base de poliéster utilizada en estos dispositivos para reducir el ruido y las vibraciones puede romperse en pedazos. Si la espuma se deshace, la persona que utiliza el dispositivo podría inhalar o tragar trozos negros de espuma o determinadas sustancias químicas que no son visibles. Los problemas supuestamente asociados al desmoronamiento de la espuma PE-PUR podrían provocar lesiones graves y requerir intervención médica para evitar lesiones permanentes.

El problema del desmoronamiento de la espuma de PE-PUR puede deberse a la exposición a condiciones de calor y humedad, y puede empeorar si se utilizan limpiadores con ozono u otros métodos de limpieza no recomendados por el fabricante.
