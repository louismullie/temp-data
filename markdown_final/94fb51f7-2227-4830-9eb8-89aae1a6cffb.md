## Question

How does a sedentary lifestyle lead to DVT?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how a sedentary (prolonged-sitting) lifestyle promotes deep-vein thrombosis (DVT). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching pathophysiologic framework, namely Virchow's triad. Then, I should examine how sitting causes venous stasis in the legs. Next, I will evaluate how stasis drives endothelial activation via local hypoxia. After that, I should consider how immobility shifts blood toward hypercoagulability. Then, I need to integrate how these limbs converge to form thrombus in typical venous sites, before accounting for amplifying cofactors and population-level epidemiology. Finally, I will verify whether brief activity, leg exercises, and compression reverse the hemodynamic and hemostatic abnormalities, and end with clinically relevant take-aways that align with the evidence base [^111VMc7Q] [^113F9EJt] [^116SBmrk].

> Let me first confirm the conceptual anchor: venous thrombosis is classically understood through Virchow's triad — stasis, endothelial injury/activation, and hypercoagulability — which together lower the threshold for thrombus initiation and propagation; I should be careful to keep each limb distinct while acknowledging their interactions to avoid over-attributing effects to any single mechanism [^111VMc7Q].

> I will now examine stasis from sitting; prolonged seated posture dampens the calf-muscle pump and can kink or compress the popliteal venous segment, sharply reducing antegrade flow — ultrasound studies in healthy volunteers show popliteal volume flow drops by roughly 40% within minutes of quiet sitting and nearly twofold when feet are not supported, which is a substantial hemodynamic perturbation in the deep venous system [^116aGoQY]. Hold on, I should verify clinical correlates: in immobile stroke cohorts, about 11% developed DVT within the first week, emphasizing that stasis-related events appear early in immobilization, and meta-analytic data in bedridden medical patients estimate an approximately 1.9-fold higher VTE risk, consistent with stasis as a proximal driver of events [^116fA4Rf] [^111WwNhi]. Let me also check real-world sedentary behavior data: accelerometer findings in older women indicate that the average sitting-bout duration — not merely total sitting time — tracks with incident VTE risk, with a 15% higher hazard per additional 5 minutes in mean bout length, which plausibly reflects more sustained stasis periods [^116SBmrk].

> Next, I should review how stasis engenders local hypoxia and endothelial activation; in low-shear venous valve pockets and behind cusps, oxygen tension falls when flow stalls, biasing the endothelium toward a procoagulant phenotype with upregulation of P-selectin, von Willebrand factor, and tissue factor that facilitate platelet and leukocyte adhesion and initiate fibrin generation on an activated surface, especially when compounded by environmental hypoxia such as during air travel [^113F9EJt]. Wait, let me verify the role of circulating effectors: tissue factor–bearing microparticles derived from monocyte/macrophage lineages can dock via selectin ligands onto activated endothelium, directly seeding coagulation complexes under low-flow conditions, which aligns with a stasis–hypoxia–inflammation interface in early DVT biology [^115V19Wo]. I should also remember that endothelial thromboinflammatory signaling pathways such as the Gab2–MALT1 axis and regulators like CD39 modulate this response, with experimental inhibition reducing P-selectin/vWF exocytosis and venous thrombus burden in stasis models, reinforcing that endothelial activation is not merely epiphenomenal to stasis but mechanistically contributory [^112djwqn] [^111MKBUa].

> I will now consider the hypercoagulable limb induced by uninterrupted sitting; over several hours of sitting, hemoconcentration and rheologic changes emerge via plasma volume contraction, increasing hematocrit and whole-blood viscosity, while plasma fibrinogen rises — effects that are attenuated by brief, regular activity breaks, suggesting immobility acutely shifts the hemostatic milieu toward thrombogenesis [^113Q1JHJ]. Hold on, let me not overstate D-dimer acutely; in that trial, D-dimer did not change between conditions, yet in broader clinical literature persistently elevated D-dimer is a recognized VTE risk marker, so I should separate acute experimental dynamics from prognostic biomarkers in at-risk populations [^113Q1JHJ] [^115iBcFh]. But wait, what about hypoxia per se during travel? Small controlled studies suggest that mild normobaric hypoxia increases platelet and leukocyte counts without clear independent coagulation activation, pointing again to immobility and hemorheology as principal near-term drivers, while travel case-crossover data show higher FVIII and soluble P-selectin among those with clotting activation, cohering with a procoagulant shift in susceptible individuals during prolonged sitting [^111KWYB8] [^115ZuL9A].

> Let me integrate these limbs carefully; when sustained stasis slows venous return, local hypoxia activates endothelium, and concurrent hemoconcentration and acute-phase reactants like fibrinogen rise, the combined probability of platelet–leukocyte adhesion and fibrin generation rises nonlinearly, especially in anatomic niches of disturbed flow such as valve pockets and the popliteal segment during sitting, where many calf-origin DVTs are thought to begin before extending proximally if unchecked [^116aGoQY] [^112t9Jc1]. Hold on, I should verify the anatomic distribution in immobilized patients: in immobile stroke cohorts, early events included popliteal and femoral thromboses, with about 39% confined to calf veins and substantial proportions in proximal segments, underscoring that propagation from calf to femoral can occur within weeks, which tracks with the mechanistic cascade I just outlined [^116fA4Rf]. Let me reconsider the valve-pocket origin claim; although hemodynamic theory strongly implicates valve pockets, direct in vivo human proof remains limited, so I should acknowledge the noninflammatory hemodynamic literature that supports — but does not definitively prove — valve-pocket initiation of thrombi under stasis conditions [^113nzqD4] [^111cPV6s].

> I need to ensure I consider cofactors that amplify risk alongside sitting; higher adiposity increases intra-abdominal pressure, impedes venous return, and contributes to a procoagulant state, and importantly, BMI mediated roughly 30% of the association between sitting-bout duration and incident VTE in older women, indicating part of the sedentary–VTE link is channeled through adiposity [^116SBmrk]. Older age, functional impairment, and immobility additively raise risk, with case–control data in elders showing substantially higher VTE odds with sedentary lifestyle and impaired mobility, which complements the physiologic plausibility of stasis and endothelial dysfunction in aging vasculature [^113e9Wx8]. I should also check for other contributors frequently co-traveling with sedentary patterns, such as dehydration in travelers, hormonal therapy, and chronic inflammatory conditions, each tilting the hemostatic balance toward thrombosis in the presence of stasis [^116aGoQY] [^115iBcFh].

> Next, I should review population-level signals linking sedentariness with VTE outcomes; beyond bed rest meta-analytic estimates around a twofold risk, long-distance travel confers a pooled VTE relative risk of about 2.8, with an approximately 18% higher risk per additional 2 hours of travel, consistent with dose–duration features of stasis and intermittent hypoxia exposures, while accelerometer-based data indicate that the patterning of sitting (longer uninterrupted bouts) is more predictive than total sitting hours, likely because it more directly captures venous stasis physiology [^111WwNhi] [^114pajbJ] [^116SBmrk]. Wait, let me double-check measurement caveats; self-reported sitting in prior cohorts showed associations with idiopathic pulmonary embolism, but differences in how sitting was queried across time points and potential residual confounding warrant caution, making the objective accelerometer evidence particularly informative here [^116Z7iDc] [^112Y3FYP].

> Intervention evidence should corroborate causality if this pathway is correct; interrupting sitting with 2-minute light-intensity walking every 20 minutes attenuates the fibrinogen rise and reverses hemoconcentration, while both light and moderate breaks prevent the increase in hematocrit and hemoglobin that accompanies uninterrupted sitting, indicating that restoring calf-pump flow and plasma volume counters the hypercoagulable shift [^113Q1JHJ]. Hmm, wait a minute — did moderate-intensity breaks also blunt fibrinogen? Let me verify; no, the attenuation of fibrinogen was significant with light-intensity breaks, whereas both intensities mitigated hemoconcentration, so I should not overstate the fibrinogen effect of moderate-intensity breaks here [^113Q1JHJ]. I should confirm that targeted lower-limb exercises augment venous return; ankle and foot exercises substantially increase popliteal venous flow during sitting, and for higher-risk immobilized inpatients, high-quality evidence supports graduated compression stockings to reduce DVT incidence by improving venous hemodynamics, aligning with the stasis mechanism [^116aGoQY] [^1153vbAx].

> But wait, what about time course and practical implications in the most immobile patients; the majority of DVTs after acute immobility appear within the first 7–10 days, with additional events by one month, implying that early, sustained prophylaxis and mobilization efforts are necessary if we aim to interrupt the stasis–activation–hypercoagulability cascade before thrombus consolidation and proximal propagation occur [^116fA4Rf]. Hold on, I should verify whether bedside risk assessment reliably captures this; audits suggest reduced mobility is often misjudged at admission, risking underuse or misapplication of prophylaxis, so serial reassessment of mobility during hospitalization is prudent to keep risk stratification aligned with dynamic clinical status [^113EhxRL].

> Pulling this together, a sedentary lifestyle promotes DVT through a coherent sequence: sitting-induced stasis impairs venous return, stasis fosters local hypoxia and endothelial activation, immobility shifts blood toward hypercoagulability via hemoconcentration and fibrinogen rise, and these changes converge in low-shear venous niches — particularly in the calf and popliteal segments during sitting — to initiate thrombus that may propagate proximally if unaddressed, with risk magnified by coexisting factors such as obesity, aging, dehydration, and hormonal exposures; mechanistic plausibility, epidemiologic gradients, temporal clustering with immobility, and reversal of abnormalities with brief movement and compression together support this causal pathway [^111VMc7Q] [^113F9EJt] [^116aGoQY] [^116SBmrk] [^111WwNhi] [^1153vbAx] [^116fA4Rf] [^113Q1JHJ] [^115iBcFh].

> Clinically, I need to ensure patients at risk minimize uninterrupted sitting by standing or walking for a couple of minutes every 20–30 minutes, perform frequent ankle pumps when seated, maintain hydration during long travel, and use compression in high-risk immobilized settings, while initiating guideline-based pharmacologic prophylaxis when indicated; early attention in the first days of immobilization matters most because that is when the stasis-driven cascade is most likely to produce new thrombi, and even modest, regular movement can meaningfully restore venous flow and blunt prothrombotic shifts in blood and endothelium [^113Q1JHJ] [^116aGoQY] [^1153vbAx] [^116fA4Rf].

Being sedentary causes DVT by **venous stasis** from prolonged sitting [^116aGoQY] or bed rest [^116fA4Rf], which reduces calf muscle pump activity [^111VMc7Q] and slows venous return, especially in the lower limbs [^115ZNu6w]. Stasis leads to **endothelial dysfunction** [^115V19Wo] and local hypoxia [^113F9EJt], activating coagulation [^111VMc7Q] and promoting thrombus formation. Sedentary behavior [^113Q1JHJ] also increases **hypercoagulability** via higher fibrinogen and factor VIII [^115ZuL9A], and raises DVT risk 2–4-fold [^111WwNhi] in immobilized or sedentary individuals [^113e9Wx8]. Risk is highest with prolonged immobility [^111VMc7Q], obesity [^113GGYKL], older age [^1149fGAF], and thrombophilia [^116YYuGJ], and can be reduced by regular movement [^114pajbJ], hydration, and compression stockings [^1153vbAx].

### Venous stasis and reduced blood flow

- **Venous stasis**: Prolonged immobility reduces calf muscle pump activity [^111VMc7Q], slowing venous return [^1134dVkU] and causing blood pooling in the lower limbs [^116aGoQY].

- **Valve pockets**: Stasis concentrates procoagulant factors and platelets in venous valve pockets [^113nzqD4], creating a prothrombotic environment [^111cPV6s].

- **Local hypoxia**: Stasis-induced hypoxia activates endothelial cells [^113F9EJt] and coagulation pathways, promoting thrombus formation [^115V19Wo].

---

### Endothelial dysfunction and inflammation

Immobility triggers **endothelial activation**, increasing expression of adhesion molecules (e.g. P-selectin, VCAM-1) and tissue factor [^112djwqn], which initiates coagulation. It also elicits an **inflammatory response** [^114ak1C2] that recruits leukocytes and platelets [^111MKBUa], further amplifying thrombus formation.

---

### Hypercoagulability and altered blood composition

Sedentary behavior [^113Q1JHJ] elevates **coagulation factors**, including fibrinogen and factor VIII [^115ZuL9A], and reduces **fibrinolysis** [^112dqszf], favoring thrombus persistence and growth.

---

### Clinical evidence linking sedentary behavior to DVT

- **Hospitalized patients**: Immobilization increases VTE risk by 1.86-fold [^111WwNhi] in medical patients.

- **Older adults**: Sedentary lifestyle (≥ 20 h/day sitting) increases DVT risk fourfold [^113e9Wx8] in older adults.

- **Prolonged travel**: Long-distance travel (> 4 hours) [^114pajbJ] increases DVT risk [^115ZuL9A], especially with additional risk factors.

### Risk factors exacerbating sedentary-related DVT

| **Risk factor** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|
| Obesity | Increased venous pressure and hypercoagulability [^113GGYKL] |
| Age | Reduced mobility and endothelial dysfunction [^113GGYKL] |
| Genetic predisposition | Inherited thrombophilias (e.g. factor V Leiden) [^116YYuGJ] |
| Hormonal therapy | Increased coagulation factors [^115iBcFh] |
| Cancer | Hypercoagulability and immobility [^115wjomn] |

---

### Preventive measures

- **Regular movement**: Frequent movement or exercise [^111VMc7Q] reduces venous stasis [^116aGoQY] and DVT risk [^114pajbJ].

- **Hydration**: Adequate hydration maintains blood viscosity and reduces clot risk.

- **Compression stockings**: Graduated compression stockings [^1153vbAx] reduce DVT risk in immobilized patients.

---

Sedentary behavior increases DVT risk through **venous stasis**, **endothelial dysfunction**, **inflammation**, and **hypercoagulability**; risk is highest with prolonged immobility, obesity, older age, and thrombophilia, and can be mitigated by regular movement, hydration, and compression stockings [^115ZNu6w].

### Effect of leg exercises on popliteal venous blood flow during prolonged immobility of seated subjects: Implications for prevention of travel-related deep vein thrombosis [^116aGoQY]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2007). Low credibility.

Venous stasis is an important contributing factor in the development of travel-related deep vein thrombosis. This study examined factors affecting popliteal venous blood flow in order to determine the most effective exercise regimen to prevent venous stasis.

- **Methods**: Twenty-one healthy subjects were randomly assigned to various activities over a 9-week period. Subjects remained seated throughout the investigation and 3660 duplex ultrasound examinations were performed by a single examiner using a SonoSite 180 Plus handheld ultrasound. Baseline popliteal vein blood flow velocity, cross-sectional area, and volume flow in subjects sitting motionless were assessed in the first 3 weeks. The remaining 6 weeks involved subjects performing airline-recommended activities, foot exercises, foot exercises against moderate resistance, and foot exercises against increased resistance to determine the most beneficial method for enhancing popliteal venous flow. Sitting with feet not touching the floor and the effect of sleeping were also assessed.

- **Results**: The median age of the subjects was 22 years (range: 18–25.5 years), height 171 cm (162.5–180.5 cm), and body mass index 25.3 kg m(-2) (23.2–26.3 kg m(-2)). Blood volume flow in the popliteal vein was reduced by almost 40% with immobility of seated subjects and by almost 2-fold when sitting motionless with feet not touching the floor. Foot exercises against increased resistance positively enhanced volume flow (P < 0.0001).

- **Conclusion**: Leg exercise regimens enhanced popliteal venous flow during prolonged immobility of seated subjects.

### Immobilization and the risk of venous thromboembolism. A meta-analysis on epidemiological studies [^111WwNhi]. Thrombosis Research (2009). Low credibility.

The thrombogenic burden of immobilization remains unknown, especially in the medical setting. Most epidemiological studies estimating the link between risk factors and venous thromboembolism (VTE) have not been designed to evaluate immobilization. The aim of this work was to estimate the risk of VTE in medical bedridden patients through a systematic review and a meta-analysis.

- **Methods**: A search on PUBMED and EMBASE was conducted to retrieve case-control and cohort studies showing the proportion of bedridden patients with or without VTE. Included studies were categorized into six groups based on the following criteria: 1) their design (cohort or case-control), 2) the targeted population (with or without suspicion of VTE), and 3) the medical setting (ambulatory or hospital). Odds ratios and relative risk for case-control and cohort studies were calculated using a random-effects method. Heterogeneity and publication bias were statistically assessed by the I(2) statistics and funnel plots with Egger's tests.

- **Results**: A total of 43 studies were included (24,181 patients). The pooled relative risk (RR) ranged from 1.46 to 2.77 in the subgroups of cohort studies (n = 36), with an overall RR of 1.86 (1.61–2.14; P < 0.001). The pooled odds ratios (OR) were 2.79 and 2.47 in the two subgroups of case-control studies (n = 7), both statistically significant (overall OR: 2.52; 1.70–3.74; P < 0.001). Heterogeneity through studies was demonstrated in four subgroups. Publication bias was only observed in one subgroup.

- **Conclusions**: Among medical patients, immobilization increases the risk of VTE. Nevertheless, a specific role of immobilization in VTE risk remains to be further clarified.

### Graduated compression stockings for prevention of deep vein thrombosis [^1153vbAx]. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Hospitalised patients are at increased risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower limb and pelvic veins due to prolonged immobilisation associated with their medical or surgical illness. Patients with DVT are at an increased risk of developing a pulmonary embolism (PE). The use of graduated compression stockings (GCS) in hospitalised patients has been proposed to decrease the risk of DVT. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2000 and last updated in 2014.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of graduated compression stockings in preventing deep vein thrombosis in various groups of hospitalised patients.

- **Search methods**: For this review, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and trials registries on 21 March 2017; and the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, CINAHL Ebsco, AMED Ovid, and trials registries on 12 June 2018.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving GCS alone, or GCS used on a background of any other DVT prophylactic method. We combined results from both of these groups of trials.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors assessed potentially eligible trials for inclusion. One review author extracted the data, which a second review author cross-checked and authenticated. Two review authors assessed the methodological quality of trials with the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool.

### Cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to air travel-induced thrombosis [^113F9EJt]. Circulation Research (2025). High credibility.

Venous thromboembolism, characterized by deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is the third most common cardiovascular disease in the world. Deep vein thrombosis occurs when a blood clot forms in areas of impaired blood flow, and it is significantly affected by environmental factors. Local hypoxia, caused by venous stasis, plays a critical role in deep vein thrombosis under normal conditions, and this effect is intensified when the Po2 decreases, such as during air travel or high-altitude exposure. The lower oxygen levels and reduced pressure at high altitudes further contribute to deep vein thrombosis development. These conditions increase the pro-coagulant activity of neutrophils, platelets, and red blood cells, which interact on the surface of activated endothelial cells, promoting clot formation.

Understanding the mechanisms involved in thrombus formation when Po2 is reduced, with or without pressure reduction, is crucial for preventing the development of venous thromboembolism in such conditions and identifying innovative therapeutic targets. This literature review explores the mechanisms involved in thrombus formation related to high-altitude conditions and discusses the pro-coagulant consequences induced by environmental disturbances.

### Deep vein thrombosis: a clinical review [^111VMc7Q]. Journal of Blood Medicine (2011). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on deep vein thrombosis:

- **Definition**: DVT is the formation of a thrombus within the deep veins of the lower extremity, characterized by lower extremity pain, swelling, and calf tenderness.

- **Pathophysiology**: DVT is caused by thrombus formation due to venous stasis, endothelial injury, and blood hypercoagulability.

- **Disease course**: Thrombus formation in the lower extremities due to venous stasis, endothelial injury, and blood hypercoagulability results in DVT, which causes clinical manifestations of lower extremity pain, swelling, and calf tenderness. Disease progression may lead to postphlebitic syndrome and pulmonary hypertension. Acute complications may result in PE, which might prove fatal.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The 90-day mortality rates of asymptomatic proximal DVT and asymptomatic distal DVT are 13.75% and 3.39%, respectively.

### Functional impairment and risk of venous thrombosis in older adults [^113e9Wx8]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2017). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the role of age-specific risk factors for thrombosis in older adults, with a particular focus on functional impairment.

- **Design**: Case-control study.
- **Setting**: The Age and Thrombosis-Acquired and Genetic Risk Factors in the Elderly Study, conducted in the Netherlands and the United States from 2008 to 2011.
- **Participants**: Included individuals aged 70 and older with a first-time deep venous thrombosis in the leg or pulmonary embolism (n = 401) and controls aged 70 and older without a history of thrombosis (n = 431). Exclusion criteria were active malignancy and severe cognitive disorders.
- **Measurements**: Thrombotic risk associated with functional impairment was evaluated. Functional impairment was defined as having impairments in two or more activities of daily living (ADLs), impaired mobility (inability to walk outside), a sedentary lifestyle (≥ 20 hours per day sleeping or sitting), and low handgrip strength (< 15th percentile). Odds ratios (ORs) adjusted for age, sex, and study center with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and population attributable risks (PAR) were calculated.

The results indicated an increased risk of venous thrombosis associated with functional impairment. The risk was 2.9 times greater (OR = 2.9, 95% CI = 1.6–5.3) in individuals with ADL impairment, three times greater (OR = 3.0, 95% CI = 1.9–4.7) in those with impaired mobility, four times greater (OR = 4.0, 95% CI = 2.5–6.3) in those with a sedentary lifestyle, and 2.3 times greater (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.5–3.4) in those with weak handgrip strength. The PARs were 8% for ADL disability, 13% for inability to walk outside for 15 minutes, 29% for a sedentary lifestyle, and 13% for weak handgrip strength.

### Impact on hemostatic parameters of interrupting sitting with intermittent activity [^113Q1JHJ]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2013). Low credibility.

Excessive sitting has been associated with an elevated risk of vascular conditions, particularly venous thrombosis. Interrupting sitting time with intermittent physical activity can reduce venous stasis; however, impacts on other aspects of thrombogenesis are less understood.

- **Purpose**: To examine the effects of interrupting sitting time on blood coagulation and blood volume parameters in sedentary, middle-age, overweight/obese adults (11 men and 8 women; age = 53.8 ± 4.9 years, body mass index = 31.2 ± 4.1 kg · m(-2); mean ± SD).

- **Methods**: The randomized three-period, three-treatment acute crossover trial consisted of uninterrupted sitting and sitting interrupted by 2-minute bouts of either light- or moderate-intensity treadmill walking every 20 minutes. In each trial condition, blood samples were collected at baseline before the consumption of a standardized meal (-2 hours) and postintervention (5 hours).

- **Results**: Plasma fibrinogen increased from baseline with uninterrupted sitting (0.24 g · L(-2), 95% confidence interval = 0.13–0.34, P < 0.001). Light-intensity, but not moderate-intensity, activity breaks attenuated the increase by 0.17 g · L(-1) (95% confidence interval = 0.01–0.32, P < 0.05). There were no between-condition differences in prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, von Willebrand factor, D-dimer, or platelet count. Uninterrupted sitting reduced plasma volume and increased hematocrit, hemoglobin, and red blood cell count; effects attenuated by both light- and moderate-intensity breaks (P < 0.05). White blood cell count increased with uninterrupted sitting.

### Deep venous thrombosis [^115V19Wo]. Hematology, American Society of Hematology Education Program (2004). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), manifested as either deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), is an extremely common medical problem, occurring either in isolation or as a complication of other diseases or procedures. Yet, despite its frequency, much remains to be learned regarding the pathogenic mechanisms that initiate VTE, tailoring its treatment to the individual with their specific set of risk factors for recurrence, and its medical management when associated with specific disease entities, such as cancer. These three topics are addressed in this chapter.

- **Mechanisms of venous thrombus initiation**: Drs. López and Conde discuss how venous thrombi may be initiated on the vessel wall in the absence of anatomically overt vessel wall injury. The authors propose a model where tissue factor (TF)-bearing microvesicles, arising from cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage, can fuse with activated endothelial cells in regions of vessel activation or inflammation to initiate blood coagulation. Key components of this model include the docking of microvesicles to the stimulated endothelium through P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 on their surfaces binding to either P-selectin or E-selectin on the endothelium, and the role of hypoxia during blood stasis in initiating local endothelial activation. Elevations in the levels of TF-bearing microvesicles associated with inflammatory conditions would help to explain the increased risk of thrombosis associated with infections and inflammatory states such as inflammatory bowel disease.

Dr. Clive Kearon discusses additional aspects of this topic, although the details from Section II are not fully included here.

Regarding the medical management for deep vein thrombosis, specifically in the context of choosing anticoagulation, the ESVS 2021 guidelines recommend administering direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) rather than low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) followed by vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in patients with calf DVT requiring anticoagulation.

### Physical activity and risk of recurrence and mortality after incident venous thromboembolism [^111mFQkV]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Low credibility.

Limited data exist on the relationship between physical activity and major complications after incident venous thromboembolism (VTE).

- **Objectives**: To investigate whether physical activity was associated with the risk of recurrence and mortality in patients with VTE recruited from the general population.

- **Methods**: Patients with incident VTE (n = 786) derived from the Tromsø Study surveys 4–6 (1994–1995, 2001–2002, and 2007–2008) were included. Data on physical activity were dichotomized according to the activity level reported in the survey preceding the incident VTE (inactive: < 1 hour per week, active: ≥ 1 hour per week). Recurrent VTE and all-cause mortality were registered up to December 31, 2015. Hazard ratios (HRs) for recurrence and all-cause mortality were calculated using Cox regression models with the inactive group as reference.

- **Results**: There were 139 recurrences and 395 deaths during follow-up. Physical activity was not associated with the risk of recurrence in men (HR model 2: 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83–2.65) or in women (HR model 2: 0.95, 95% CI 0.52–1.74). In contrast, physical activity was associated with a 28% lower risk of mortality during 10 years of follow-up (HR model 3: 0.72, 95% CI 0.57–0.91). The inverse association was stronger in patients with a first deep vein thrombosis (HR model 2: 0.59, 95% CI 0.44–0.79) than a pulmonary embolism (HR model 3: 0.87, 95% CI 0.61–1.26).

- **Conclusion**: Our results suggest that habitual physical activity prior to incident VTE does not influence the risk of recurrence. In contrast, active individuals exhibited a lower risk of mortality.

### Genetic risk factors of venous thrombosis [^116YYuGJ]. Human Genetics (2001). Low credibility.

Venous thrombosis, whose main clinical presentations include deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, represents a major health problem worldwide. Numerous conditions predispose individuals to venous thrombosis, commonly referred to as risk indicators or risk factors.

- **Classically acquired risk factors**: These include advanced age, prolonged immobilization, surgery, fractures, use of oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy, pregnancy, puerperium, cancer, and antiphospholipid syndrome.

- **Novel genetic risk factors**: Several lines of evidence that have emerged over the past few decades indicate their role, mainly related to the haemostatic system, in influencing thrombotic risk. A significant breakthrough has been the confirmation that inherited hypercoagulable conditions are present in a large proportion of patients with venous thromboembolic disease. These include mutations in the genes encoding antithrombin, protein C, and protein S, as well as the factor V Leiden and factor II G20210 A mutations.

Moreover, plasmatic risk indicators, such as hyperhomocysteinemia and elevated concentrations of factors II, VIII, IX, XI, and fibrinogen, have been documented. This extensive list of genetic and acquired factors illustrates that a single cause of venous thrombosis does not exist. Therefore, this condition should be considered a complex or multifactorial trait.

Regarding the medical management of deep vein thrombosis, particularly in terms of the choice of anticoagulation and initial management for unprovoked thrombosis, the ACCP 2021 guidelines recommend considering the administration of adjusted-dose VKAs (target INR 2.5, with an overlapping period of parenteral anticoagulation) rather than DOACs for the treatment phase in patients with confirmed antiphospholipid syndrome receiving anticoagulant therapy.

### Physical inactivity and idiopathic pulmonary embolism in women: Prospective study [^116Z7iDc]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

We used self-reported time sitting as a proxy measure for physical inactivity. We believe that this measure accurately reflects an individual's overall physical inactivity, though we acknowledge that any single measure will not fully describe a person's lifestyle. We used two time points (1988 and 1990) to measure physical inactivity. Though it is possible that levels of physical inactivity changed over time, we did not have the ability to detect any changes. Further studies incorporating direct and continuous measurements of physical inactivity would be beneficial.

We also acknowledge that the variable we used to determine the time sitting was different in 1988 and 1990. In 1990, the Nurses' Health Study questionnaire divided time sitting into several categories. We chose time sitting at home to account for the majority of time spent sitting during the day and therefore best reflect a "sedentary lifestyle". Our results, however, could have been slightly different if overall time sitting had been available for analysis in both years.

Our case definition for pulmonary embolism was relatively stringent and required confirmation in medical records. As a result, we might have missed some cases. The incidence we found, however, is similar to that previously reported in the literature. Data on one potential confounder, warfarin use, were first collected four years after cohort inception and thus might have been incompletely controlled for in our model. Finally, we consider that our results could have been influenced by measurement bias, investigation bias, or inaccuracies arising.

### Chymase inhibition resolves and prevents deep vein thrombosis without increasing bleeding time in the mouse model [^11157AYe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Low credibility.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a major cause of venous thromboembolism, is commonly associated with "flow‐impeding" clots located predominantly in major veins. DVT in humans requires medical consultation with rapid diagnosis and potential therapy to reduce the risk of complications, such as pulmonary embolism or post‐thrombotic syndrome. Numerous risk factors are involved in the incidence and severity of the disease, including cancer or cancer therapy, aging, obesity, diabetes, smoking, pregnancy, birth control medications, defective coagulation systems, and family genetics. Health care costs associated with DVT and pulmonary embolism annually exceed $10 billion in the United States.

Suspicion of a DVT by health care professionals is commonly confirmed by ultrasound imaging of the affected area and by measuring plasma concentrations of D-dimer, a marker for polymeric fibrin degradation complexes. Appropriate treatment strategies are often implemented according to a risk assessment model to adapt a treatment regimen to the risk level of the patient. It can be limited to 3 months to reduce the existing thrombus burden or indefinitely prolonged to reduce the risk of reoccurring events as well as the risk of more severe complications, such as pulmonary embolism. Low‐molecular‐weight heparins, such as enoxaparin, vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, and direct oral anticoagulants, such as rivaroxaban or apixaban, are indicated and recommended for the treatment or prevention of DVT, depending on various factors. However, these medications share important limitations.

### Effect of physical activity after recent deep venous thrombosis: a cohort study [^11739Gqy]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2005). Low credibility.

To determine whether increased physical activity 1 month after deep vein thrombosis (DVT) led to worsening of venous symptoms and signs within the subsequent 3 months, a multicenter prospective cohort study was conducted. Patients with acute DVT were evaluated using validated questionnaires at baseline, 1 month, and 4 months post-DVT. The Godin Questionnaire measured physical activity, the VEINES-QOL assessed disease severity, and the postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) scale evaluated symptoms and signs usually attributed to sequelae of DVT.

Of the 301 patients followed for 4 months, 25% were inactive and another 25% were only mildly active before their DVT. In the univariate analysis, physical activity at 1 month was not associated with a change in PTS score between 1 month and 4 months (P = 0.42). However, after adjusting for potential confounders such as age, sex, pre-DVT physical activity, and disease severity at 1 month, the results suggested that higher physical activity levels at 1 month may be protective against worsening of the PTS score over the subsequent 3 months. Compared with those who were inactive at 1 month, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.47, 1.87) for mildly to moderately active persons, and 0.52 (95% CI: 0.24, 1.15) for highly active persons. Among patients who were active pre-DVT (N = 220), 55.5% had returned to their previous levels of physical activity or greater within 4 months.

In conclusion, for most individuals, exercise at 1 month post-DVT does not appear to worsen venous symptoms and signs over the subsequent 3 months, and more than 50% resume their previous level of physical activity by the 4-month mark.

### Challenges in the prevention of venous thromboembolism in the elderly [^115CTFoi]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2004). Low credibility.

Aging itself is a risk factor for venous thromboembolism, and the prevalence in the elderly of additional risk factors, such as cancer, orthopedic surgery, and immobility, increases its intrinsic risk. Many in the medical community are reluctant to prescribe anticoagulation for primary and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism to their geriatric patients, fearing that bleeding complications may outweigh the benefits. A thorough analysis of the data supports the concept that the under-use of heparin in primary prevention in the elderly is more related to medical beliefs than to facts.

The risk of bleeding due to oral anticoagulants for secondary prevention is greatly reduced by keeping the International Normalized Ratio (INR) values within therapeutic ranges and carefully avoiding conditions or drugs that may interfere with such treatment. The oral direct thrombin inhibitor ximelagatran has been studied for primary prophylaxis in hip and knee replacement surgery, secondary prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism, and acute venous thromboembolism treatment. The selective factor Xa inhibitor fondaparinux has been approved for primary prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in hip and knee replacement surgery and in hip fracture surgery. Studies on these latter drugs, where most of the patients were over 65 years of age, further show that the fear of bleeding complications due to anticoagulation in the elderly is largely unjustified.

### Comparison of presentation, treatment, and outcomes of venous thromboembolism in long-term immobile patients based on age [^112qRCim]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Chronic immobility is prevalent, especially as people age. However, little is known about venous thromboembolism (VTE) outcomes in this population.

- **Objective**: To compare the presentation, treatment, and outcomes in chronically immobile (> 8 weeks) patients older versus younger than 75 who presented with VTE.

- **Design**: An observational international registry of patients with VTE.

- **Participants**: Patients with acute VTE from the "Registro Informatizado Enfermedad Tromboembolica" (RIETE) registry who were chronically immobile.

- **Main measures**: Baseline characteristics, presenting signs and symptoms, treatment and outcomes including major bleeding, recurrent VTE (reVTE), and mortality.

- **Key results**: Among 4612 immobile patients (mean age 75.7 years, 34% male), 2127 (46%) presented with pulmonary embolism (PE). Patients older than 75 years presented more often with dyspnea (44% vs. 38%) or altered mental status (23% vs. 8.1%) and less often with chest pain (13% vs. 18%). The median duration of anticoagulation was shorter in older compared with younger patients [126 vs. 169 days]. During the first 90 days of anticoagulation, major bleeding (4.0% vs. 2.2%), PE-related death (2.5% vs. 1.1%), and bleeding-related death (0.78% vs. 0.26%) occurred more frequently among older patients. In 3550 patients who received anticoagulation beyond 90 days, older patients had more major bleeding [4.23 vs. 2.21 events per 100 patient-years]. After anticoagulation discontinuation, reVTE and major bleeding occurred in 11.8 and 9.25 and 1.49 and 0.69 events per 100 patient-years, respectively.

### Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis [^115ZNu6w]. Lancet (2012). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is the third most common cause of death from cardiovascular disease after heart attack and stroke. Sequelae occurring after venous thromboembolism include chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and post-thrombotic syndrome. Venous thromboembolism and atherothrombosis share common risk factors and the common pathophysiological characteristics of inflammation, hypercoagulability, and endothelial injury. Clinical probability assessment helps identify patients with low clinical probability for whom the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism can be excluded solely with a negative result from a plasma D-dimer test. The diagnosis is usually confirmed with compression ultrasound showing deep vein thrombosis or with chest CT showing pulmonary embolism.

Most patients with venous thromboembolism will respond to anticoagulation, which is the foundation of treatment. Patients with pulmonary embolism should undergo risk stratification to establish whether they will benefit from the addition of advanced treatment, such as thrombolysis or embolectomy. Several novel oral anticoagulant drugs are in development. These drugs, which could replace vitamin K antagonists and heparins in many patients, are prescribed in fixed doses and do not need any coagulation monitoring in the laboratory. Although rigorous clinical trials have reported the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological prevention with low, fixed doses of anticoagulant drugs, prophylaxis remains underused in patients admitted to the hospital at moderate risk and high risk for venous thromboembolism.

### Immune factors in deep vein thrombosis initiation [^112f74JR]. Trends in Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

DVT and its major complication, pulmonary embolism (PE), designated together as venous thromboembolism (VTE), are among the leading causes of disability and death worldwide. VTE is the third most common cardiovascular pathology by prevalence, following myocardial infarction and stroke, with approximately 900,000 cases and 300,000 deaths in the US annually. Surprisingly, the prevalence and mortality of VTE have not substantially decreased over the past 30 years, despite advancements in diagnostic and prophylactic modalities.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) typically develops in deep veins, usually — but not exclusively — in the legs, causing pain, redness, swelling, and impaired gait. If the thrombus is unstable, it can detach and travel to the lungs, occluding pulmonary circulation and causing PE. In contrast to arterial thrombosis, whose mechanisms have been intensively investigated, DVT remains largely terra incognita, which inspired the American Surgeon General to issue a Call to Action to stimulate research on venous thrombosis.

### Quantification of risk factors for venous thromboembolism: A preliminary study for the development of a risk assessment tool [^116aLBqZ]. Haematologica (2003). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism is a frequent and serious disorder influenced by numerous factors. As the first step in creating a tool to assess an individual patient's risk of venous thromboembolism, we carried out a literature review in order to quantify risk factors for venous thromboembolism.

- **Evidence and information sources**: Risk factors were identified as being either predisposing, that is, those risks presented by a patient prior to hospital admission, or exposing, that is, those risks occurring when a patient is hospitalized for a certain medical condition or surgical procedure. Predisposing risk factors were classified with regard to the patients' characteristics (including general characteristics and inherent risk factors), and recent and chronic clinical conditions.

- **Results**: The major predisposing factors among the patients' characteristics were age, hormonal therapy, and personal history of venous thromboembolism, along with inherited coagulation factor abnormalities. Clinical situations associated with the highest risk of venous thromboembolism were recent surgery, hospitalization for medical conditions and immobilization, moderate to severe congestive heart failure, and malignancy.

- **Conclusions**: This literature review will assist in the development of a suitable risk assessment tool for aiding healthcare professionals to decide whether to employ thromboprophylaxis, and, if so, to select the appropriate type and duration of prophylaxis.

### COVID-19, thromboembolic risk, and Virchow's triad: Lesson from the past [^1134dVkU]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Finally, the third component of Virchow's triad, which is blood stasis, arises from prolonged bed rest and immobilization in intensive care units, strict isolation, and limited physiotherapy. These concepts are illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Virchow's triad and COVID‐19: The three cardinal components of Virchow's triad — endothelial injury, clotting, and blood flow stasis — are often observed in COVID‐19, resulting in systemic and venous thrombosis and their manifestations, such as stroke, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), primary thrombosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

One might argue that Virchow's triad explains venous thromboembolic events, such as venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, more effectively than arterial events like ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and acute limb ischemia. However, this perspective is not entirely accurate. The majority of arterial thromboembolic events share a common origin, namely, the formation of a clot over an underlying atherosclerotic plaque. In most cases, the thrombus overlies a ruptured plaque or an intact plaque with superficial endothelial erosion. The first element of Virchow's triad remains relevant, as SARS‐CoV‐2 can directly infect arterial endothelial cells, thus causing endothelial injury. For instance, viral particles have been detected in the endothelial cells of an injured artery in a patient with a history of renal transplantation who succumbed to COVID‐19‐induced multi‐organ failure. Once the arterial wall is damaged, the innate immune system is activated, with macrophages beginning to respond.

### eThrombosis: The 21st century variant of venous thromboembolism associated with immobility [^112t9Jc1]. The European Respiratory Journal (2003). Low credibility.

The association between immobility with prolonged sitting and venous thromboembolism has been recognized for over 60 years, most notably in the context of long-distance air travel. This case study presents a 32-year-old male whose immobility from sitting at a computer for extended periods was the primary risk factor for developing life-threatening venous thromboembolism. The authors introduce the term "eThrombosis" to describe this modern variant of venous thromboembolism resulting from prolonged sitting-related immobility. Given the prevalent use of computers for work, recreation, and personal communication, the potential burden of eThrombosis may be considerable.

### Thromboprophylaxis in patients with lower limb immobilisation - review of current status [^116EEKwv]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

The risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) associated with lower limb immobilisation is unclear, owing to a lack of evidence from studies in this patient group. However, six small randomised controlled trials (RCTs), totalling 1,536 patients, compared low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) with controls and showed a significant reduction in asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from 17.1% to 9.8% with very low bleeding rates. This is likely to be an underestimate of the real risk reduction, as most trials excluded high-risk patients from randomisation. There have been no other controlled trials in cast-immobilised patients using alternative prophylactic measures. Alongside the RCTs, other cohort studies have identified risk factors that increase the risk for VTE in lower limb immobilisation. In summary, patients in lower limb cast (or brace) immobilisation should be risk assessed, and those deemed high risk for VTE should receive prophylactic LMWH for at least the duration of cast immobilisation.

### Physical inactivity and idiopathic pulmonary embolism in women: Prospective study [^112Y3FYP]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

- **Exposures**: The primary exposure was physical inactivity, defined a priori by the number of hours spent sitting per day. Time sitting was assessed in 1988 when women were asked to report "the number of hours per week [they] spent sitting (e.g. at work, at home, driving)" as none, 1, 2–5, 6–10, 11–20, 21–40, 41–60, 61–90, or over 90. It was assessed again in 1990 when women were asked to report "the number of hours per week [they] spent sitting at home" as less than half an hour, half to 1 hour, 1–2, 3–5, 6–10, 11–20, 21–40, 41–60, 61–90, or over 90. In 1990, the questionnaire also included questions assessing time sitting in the car or at work and time spent watching television.

	- We focused on time sitting at home, as this accounted for most of the time sitting during the day, and we thought it was most likely to reflect the overall time sitting as assessed in 1988. For each questionnaire response, we categorized and assigned point scores to time sitting in hours/week: low (40) = 3 points. We then added each woman's point score for time sitting in 1988 and 1990 to define their overall time sitting. Thus, each woman was assigned to one of five categories of time sitting, with point values ranging from 2 (low time sitting in 1988 and 1990) to 6 (high time sitting in 1988 and 1990).

### Hypercoagulability and hypofibrinolysis and risk of deep vein thrombosis and splanchnic vein thrombosis: similarities and differences [^112dqszf]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2011). Low credibility.

In this review, we provide an overview of the risk factors for venous thromboembolism, focusing on hypercoagulability and hypofibrinolysis. In the first part of this review, we discuss the risk factors for commonly occurring venous thrombosis, in particular, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. In the second part, we provide an overview of the risk factors for Budd-Chiari syndrome and portal vein thrombosis. These are rare, life-threatening forms of venous thromboembolism located in the splanchnic veins.

There are many similarities in the risk profiles of patients with common venous thrombosis and splanchnic vein thrombosis. Inherited thrombophilia and hypofibrinolysis increase the risk of both common venous thrombosis and splanchnic vein thrombosis. However, there are also apparent differences. Myeloproliferative neoplasms and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria have a remarkably high frequency in patients with thrombosis at these unusual sites but are rarely seen in patients with common venous thrombosis. There are also clear differences in the underlying risk factors for Budd-Chiari syndrome and portal vein thrombosis, suggesting site specificity of thrombosis even within the splanchnic venous system. These clear differences in underlying risk factors provide leads for further research on the site specificity of venous thrombosis and the development of thrombosis at these distinct sites.

### The Gab2-MALT1 axis regulates thromboinflammation and deep vein thrombosis [^112djwqn]. Blood (2022). High credibility.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is the third most common cause of cardiovascular mortality. Several studies suggest that DVT occurs at the intersection of dysregulated inflammation and coagulation upon activation of inflammasome and secretion of interleukin 1β (IL-1β) in restricted venous flow conditions. Our recent studies showed a signaling adapter protein, Gab2 (Grb2-associated binder 2), plays a crucial role in propagating inflammatory signaling triggered by IL-1β and other inflammatory mediators in endothelial cells.

The present study shows that Gab2 facilitates the assembly of the CBM (CARMA3 [CARD recruited membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein 3]-BCL-10 [B-cell lymphoma 10]-MALT1 [mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1]) signalosome, which mediates the activation of Rho and NF-κB in endothelial cells. Gene silencing of Gab2 or MALT1, the effector signaling molecule in the CBM signalosome, or pharmacological inhibition of MALT1 with a specific inhibitor, mepazine, significantly reduced IL-1β-induced Rho-dependent exocytosis of P-selectin and von Willebrand factor (VWF) and the subsequent adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial cells. MALT1 inhibition also reduced IL-1β-induced NF-κB-dependent expression of tissue factor and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1.

Consistent with the in vitro data, Gab2 deficiency or pharmacological inhibition of MALT1 suppressed the accumulation of monocytes and neutrophils at the injury site and attenuated venous thrombosis induced by the inferior vena cava ligation-induced stenosis or stasis in mice. Overall, these findings suggest that the Gab2-MALT1 axis is a critical regulator of thromboinflammation and may present a novel therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of DVT.

### Characteristics of provoked deep venous thrombosis in a tertiary care center [^112dU7kz]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Provoked deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is precipitated by a specific event. This paper compares the characteristics of provoked DVT in patients with transient risk (TR) factors and patients with continuous risk (CR) factors.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of records of all consecutive patients diagnosed with DVT between January 2013 and August 2014 was performed. Patients with provoked DVT were included in the TR group if the provoking event resolved in 2 weeks and they did not have an ongoing risk of thrombosis. Patients in the CR group had a provoked DVT with ongoing risk of thrombosis due to individual factors deemed to be ongoing risks of thrombosis, such as cancer, hypercoagulable disorder, and prolonged immobilization. Demographics, risk factors, association with pulmonary embolism (PE) and its severity, risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), and mortality were compared between the two groups.

- **Results**: A total of 838 patients were diagnosed with DVT, and 50.7% (425) were provoked. There were 127 (29.9%) patients with TR and 298 (70.1%) with CR. TR patients were younger (60.4 ± 16.3 vs 65.9 ± 16.0; p = 0.001). TR was more likely to be provoked by surgery (70.9% vs 55.4%; p = 0.003), whereas CR was more likely to be provoked by immobilization (21.5% vs 12.6%; p = 0.032). CR patients were affected by cancer (48.7%) and hypercoagulable disorders (4.4%). TR patients were more likely to have calf DVTs (36.2% vs 26.2%; p = 0.047). There was a trend toward a lower association with PE on presentation in TR (17.3% vs 21.1%; p = 0.072), but that did not reach statistical significance.

### The relationship between lifestyle factors and venous thromboembolism among women: A report from the MISS study [^114TsQGb]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

There has been a great advance in our knowledge of the role that thrombophilic factors play in the risk of venous thromboembolic events (VTE). However, the effect of lifestyle factors on VTE has been inadequately explored in large-scale studies of women. This cohort study comprised one thousand native Swedish women for each age year between 25 and 64 inclusive (total = 40,000), drawn from the South Swedish population registry for 1990, who were followed for a mean of eleven years. Seventy-four percent completed a questionnaire at the inception of the study (n = 29,518), and 24,098 women responded to a follow-up inquiry between the years 2000–2002.

The main outcome was the relationship between VTE and physical exercise, smoking habits, and alcohol consumption. Moderate drinkers of alcohol (10–15 g/d) and women engaged in strenuous exercise were at half the risk of VTE compared to those who consumed little or no alcohol or lived a sedentary life. Heavy smoking was associated with a 30% increased risk of VTE. Lifestyle factors have a major impact on the risk of VTE. Women non-smokers who were physically active and who consumed alcohol in moderation were at a lower risk of VTE.

### Venous thrombosis unchained: Pandora's box of noninflammatory mechanisms [^113nzqD4]. Blood Advances (2025). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), encompassing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, remains a significant global health burden affecting millions annually. Although the role of inflammatory processes in thrombosis is well-documented, there is growing recognition of crucial noninflammatory mechanisms in VTE pathogenesis.

The hemodynamics of venous valve pockets create areas of disturbed flow and stasis that concentrate procoagulant factors, platelets, and microparticles (MPs) while subjecting the local endothelium to mechanical stresses. This convergence of factors at valve sites explains why systemic risk factors such as metabolic syndrome (MetS), circadian variations, and altered glycocalyx function manifest as localized rather than systemic thrombosis. However, there seems to be no direct experimental (in vivo) or clinical evidence that thrombi originate in valvular pockets, and it cannot be ruled out that thrombus formation starts upstream of the valve and continues downstream, reaching the valve, which prevents its further development.

Virchow's triad, which includes blood stasis, hypercoagulability, and endothelial injury, remains fundamental to understanding venous thrombosis (VT). However, advanced molecular biology, genetics, and imaging techniques have revealed complex noninflammatory contributors to thrombosis, including altered blood flow dynamics, changes in blood components, and vascular endothelial modifications.

Research focuses on how hemodynamics, endothelial dysfunction, and genetic factors contribute to thrombotic processes, highlighting the need for a comprehensive understanding of both inflammatory and noninflammatory mechanisms in the pathogenesis of VTE.

### Exploring opportunities for primary prevention of unprovoked venous thromboembolism: Ready for prime time [^114pajbJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

A thorough 2018 review reported that approximately half of 11 epidemiologic studies found that physically active adults had a lower risk of VTE compared with inactive adults. The review concluded that physical activity may modestly reduce the risk of incident VTE but not in a dose-dependent manner. Plausible mechanisms suggested include beneficial effects of physical activity on the venous endothelium, blood flow, blood rheology, and hemostasis. A 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 epidemiologic studies estimated that the relative risk of VTE was 13% lower for those with high habitual physical activity compared with low physical activity (relative risk = 0.87 [0.79–0.95]). Using population attributable risk estimation, if the relative risk of low physical activity is 1.15 (taking the reciprocal of 0.87) and its prevalence is 25.4%, then 4% of VTE risk might be attributable to habitual physical inactivity.

Immobility, such as from paresis, bed rest, or fracture treatment, is a strong and well-established risk factor for VTE, carrying a relative risk > 5. Less extreme sedentariness also seems to increase the risk of VTE, as evidenced by episodic long-distance travel being a VTE trigger with a pooled relative risk of 2.8 (95% CI, 2.2–3.7) for travelers versus nontravelers in a 2009 meta-analysis, and an 18% higher risk for VTE for each 2-hour increase in the duration of travel (P = 0.01). In addition, habitual sitting at work or from TV watching is a moderate long-term VTE risk factor.

### Physical inactivity and idiopathic pulmonary embolism in women: Prospective study [^114Gh3kn]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

We performed age and multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazards analysis to obtain hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the risk of pulmonary embolism with physical inactivity (time sitting a day). To control as finely as possible for confounding by age, calendar time, and any possible two-way interactions between these two time scales, we stratified the analysis jointly by age in months at the start of follow-up and calendar year of the questionnaire cycle. For all analyses of physical inactivity, we used the group with the lowest amount of time sitting as the reference group. For the analyses of physical activity, we used women in the lowest fifth of physical activity as the reference group. We tested for trend across the categories of physical inactivity by treating the categories as an ordinal variable in a proportional hazards model. We formally tested for interaction. All analyses used SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

### The role of inflammation in early and late venous thrombosis: Are there clinical implications [^114ak1C2]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Venous thrombosis is associated with a significant inflammatory response. Inflammatory cells, adhesion molecules (especially selectins), cytokines, and procoagulant microparticles appear to be associated with the thrombogenic process. Once a thrombus forms, inflammatory cells are important for thrombus resolution, along with fibrinolytic agents and proinflammatory mediators. The breakdown of collagen and elastin by deep vein thrombosis (DVT) renders the vein wall stiff and non-compliant. Rapid and complete thrombus resolution should reduce vein wall damage and may prevent the development of chronic venous insufficiency. Understanding the basic biology of thrombogenesis and thrombus resolution is crucial, as novel therapies to both prevent and treat venous thrombosis — and to hasten thrombus resolution — should result from a better understanding of these basic biological mechanisms.

### Inferior vena cava agenesis: A rare cause of deep vein thrombosis [^116H9UzC]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Patient's perspective:

Before all the changes with the Coronavirus lockdown, I was a fairly active person. I had a structured daily exercise routine, which involved regularly walking every morning with the dog, getting ready for work, and cycling 25 miles on most weekends. Recent changes in my daily routine, such as working from home and walking less each day, have led me to be more sedentary than usual.

Before all of this, I've never had any problems with my health — no issues with clots or leg swelling. I had a large varicose vein in my right leg removed a number of years ago for aesthetic and comfort reasons, with some smaller ones present in both legs since my teenage years.

I initially had some lower back pain and lower abdominal pain, which I tried to walk off with the dog, but it never seemed to go away. A few days later, I felt an almighty shooting pain down my back to my left leg, which felt like a massive spasm that I thought was muscle pain or sciatica. That episode lasted for a full week, by which time both my legs started swelling up to the top of my thighs towards my groin, and I went to see my doctor.

### Can clinical features distinguish between immobile patients with stroke at high and low risk of deep vein thrombosis? Statistical modelling based on the CLOTS trials cohorts [^116wCizN]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is an important complication of stroke. Guidelines recommend that DVT prophylaxis should be guided by an assessment of the individual patient's risk. The authors aimed to develop and test models to predict DVT risk.

- **Methods**: The Clots in Legs Or sTockings after Stroke (CLOTS) Trial 1 randomized 2518 immobile patients with acute stroke to thigh-length graduated compression stockings (GCS) or no GCS, and CLOTS Trial 2 randomized 3114 to thigh-length or below-knee GCS. The authors collected potential predictive variables at baseline and detected DVTs with compression duplex ultrasound scans at about 7–10 days and 25–30 days. The authors developed models with logistic regression to predict DVT in 1242 Trial 2 patients who had two scans and tested the models in the 1422 Trial 1 patients with two scans by estimating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

- **Results**: 168 (11.8%) patients in Trial 1 and 122 (9.8%) in Trial 2 had proximal DVTs. A model based on the Trial 2 cohort contained four of the 12 baseline variables: dependent before stroke (OR = 3.62, 95% CI 2.15 to 6.08), unable to lift arms off bed (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.90), history of DVT/pulmonary embolism (OR 3.69, 95% CI 1.98 to 6.88) and diabetes (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99). The AUC in the development cohort was 0.65 but only 0.57, 95% CI (0.53 to 0.61) in the Trial 1 cohort, indicating poor discrimination.

- **Conclusions**: Unfortunately, models based on clinical factors alone discriminate poorly between immobile patients with stroke at high and low risk of DVT.

### Anticoagulation in the treatment of established venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer [^115wjomn]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2009). High credibility.

The disease of cancer-associated thrombosis can be linked to several factors:

- **Thrombosis types and conditions**: catheter-related thrombosis, cerebral venous thrombosis, migratory thrombophlebitis, superficial vein thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), splanchnic vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism (PE)

- **Medical and lifestyle factors**: exposure to chemotherapy, increased plasma D-dimer, immobility, tobacco use, pregnancy, obesity, increased serum lactate

- **Medical devices and procedures**: inserted central venous catheter, recent surgery

- **Syndromes and diseases**: Trousseau's syndrome, malignancy, chronic kidney disease (CKD)

### Acquired risk factors for venous thromboembolism in medical patients [^115iBcFh]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

Acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a serious and potentially fatal disorder that often complicates the course of hospitalized patients, but it may also affect ambulatory and otherwise healthy people. While the introduction of thromboprophylactic measures is expected to have reduced the occurrence of postoperative VTE, there is an increasing awareness of the importance of medical conditions in determining thromboembolic events.

Among the conditions that predispose patients to VTE are increasing age, cancer and its treatment, prolonged immobility, stroke or paralysis, previous VTE, congestive heart failure, acute infection, pregnancy or puerperium, dehydration, hormonal treatment, varicose veins, long air travel, acute inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatologic disease, and nephrotic syndrome. Other factors that have recently been associated with an increased risk of VTE disorders include persistent elevation of D-dimer and atherosclerotic disease.

Recognition of the incidence and clinical importance of thrombosis will most likely encourage more widespread use of antithrombotic prophylaxis in medical patients.

### Is mild normobaric hypoxia a risk factor for venous thromboembolism [^111KWYB8]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2003). Low credibility.

Modern air travel entails a cabin altitude between 1520 and 2440 meters (5000–8000 feet), leading to exposure to mild hypoxia. There is an ongoing debate regarding whether hypoxia is causally related to venous thromboembolism (VTE) occurring during or after travel. One study suggested that a short period of hypobaric hypoxia may cause activation of coagulation.

- **Objectives**: To test the hypothesis that hypoxia alone (normobaric hypoxia) causes activation of coagulation, possibly through endothelial cell activation.

- **Methods**: Six healthy male volunteers were exposed for three hours, while seated, on two separate occasions to (i) dry air (control) and (ii) a hypoxic gas mixture (12.8% O2 in N2), equivalent to breathing air at 3660 meters (12000 feet).

- **Results**: There were no differences in hemostatic or endothelial markers between the control and hypoxic groups. However, platelet and leukocyte counts increased and were significantly higher in the hypoxic group. Increases in fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor and certain rheological changes were observed, but these were not significantly distinct between the control and hypoxic groups.

- **Conclusions**: This small study does not support the previous suggestion that hypoxia causes activation of coagulation. It suggests that immobility-induced rheological changes may be more significant in the etiology of VTE occurring during or after travel.

### Physical inactivity and idiopathic pulmonary embolism in women: Prospective study [^115XQ1aK]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is a common cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, with an annual incidence in the United States of 1–2 per 1000 adults, similar to that of stroke and myocardial infarction. Pulmonary embolism typically results from a deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremities. Risk factors for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism include age, limb immobilization, malignancy, pregnancy, surgery, and acquired or inherited thrombophilias. Arterial and venous thrombosis share multiple risk factors, such as obesity, cigarette smoking, and hypertension.

Associations between physical inactivity, physical activity, and pulmonary embolism remain uncertain. Some published case-control studies found that exercising on a regular basis decreases the risk of venous thrombosis by 30–50% compared with not exercising. Other studies, however, including prospective cohort studies, have found that physical activity is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism. This inconsistency could reflect the difference between short-term exercise, which might increase the risk of thrombosis by increasing inflammation and injuries to extremities, and regular exercise, which might decrease the risk of thrombosis by improving blood flow. It is also likely that overall physical activity does not fully describe an individual's lifestyle. For example, the same number of metabolic equivalents a week can be achieved by maintaining a relatively high level of baseline activity (such as walking for eight hours) without ever engaging in strenuous physical activity.

### A case of deep venous thrombosis following protracted catatonic immobility recovered with electroconvulsive therapy: The relevance for an early intervention [^112oP5Fb]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Catatonic patients often experience prolonged inactivity and dehydration, making them prone to venous stasis, which can lead to life-threatening thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (PE). The prescription of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in such cases, although often irreplaceable, remains controversial due to the increased risk of PE and cerebral hemorrhage. The timing of clinical decisions is crucial yet difficult. We report the case of a catatonic patient suffering from malnutrition, deep venous thrombosis, severe pressure ulcers, and septic syndrome resulting from previous untimely management. The patient was successfully treated with 16 well-tolerated ECT applications and intensive supportive care. Although anecdotal, cases like this highlight the importance of early ECT to reduce the risk of potentially life-threatening complications due to prolonged catatonic inactivity, particularly for clinicians who may disregard this practice.

### Guidelines for prevention of venous thromboembolism in immobile patients secondary to neurological impairment [^115iJpWU]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients, with 7% of cases due to immobility secondary to neurological impairment. Many guidelines are available for medical or surgical patients. However, except for spinal injuries, no guidelines exist for other neurologically impaired patients at risk of VTE.

- **Aim**: Our study aimed to gather evidence from the literature to address controversial issues in VTE prevention and formulate guidelines.

- **Method**: A Clinical Standards Group is responsible for developing clinical guidelines for the Greater Manchester Neurorehabilitation Network, serving around 3 million people. The development of VTE prevention guidelines began with formulating the main questions, followed by gathering evidence from the literature. Wide consultation was conducted, and the guidelines were submitted to the group for endorsement.

- **Results**: Answers to main questions, such as the duration of thromboprophylaxis and the use of TEDS and antiplatelet drugs, were suggested. The resulting document was summarized as a flowchart for use.

- **Conclusion**: We believe the proposed guidelines are a useful tool for clinicians as they reflect the current evidence available from the literature.

### Individual risk factors predictive of venous thromboembolism in patients with temporary lower limb immobilization due to injury: A systematic review [^1148PkjU]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolic (VTE) disease is a major global cause of morbidity and mortality. An estimated 10 million episodes are diagnosed yearly; over half of these episodes are provoked by hospital admission or procedure, resulting in a significant loss of disability-adjusted life years. As a result, there has been a sustained focus on prevention over the last two decades. However, there are still patient groups where the balance of benefit and risk from thromboprophylaxis remains unclear.

Outpatients placed in temporary lower limb immobilization following injury are one such cohort. Approximately 70,000 such patients are discharged from UK emergency departments each year, with an overall symptomatic VTE rate approaching 2%. Some of these events are fatal, leading to natural reflection on prevention strategies and occasional coronial recommendations. Wide variation in practice regarding the use of immobilization (plaster cast, hinged brace, or protective boot) and the use of thromboprophylaxis continues for these patients. International guidance offers conflicting advice, from no intervention, through pragmatic shared decision making, all the way up to routine pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. This lack of consensus fosters clinical uncertainty.

### The timing, extent, progression and regression of deep vein thrombosis in immobile stroke patients: observational data from the CLOTS multicenter randomized trials [^116fA4Rf]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2011). High credibility.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is an important complication of stroke, but the evidence to support commonly used prophylactic strategies is conflicting.

- **Objectives**: To describe the incidence, extent, associated clinical features, and evolution of DVT after stroke.

- **Patients/Methods**: The CLOTS trials 1 and 2 together randomized 5,632 immobile stroke patients in 135 hospitals in nine countries. We screened patients for asymptomatic DVT with compression duplex ultrasound (CDU) at about 7–10 days and again at about 25–30 days after enrollment.

- **Results**: Six hundred and forty-one (11.4%) of 5,632 patients had DVT detected on the first CDU scan at a median of 8 days (interquartile range [IQR] 7–10 days) after enrollment, and an additional 176 (3.1%) had a DVT on the second CDU scan at a median of 28 days (IQR 26–30 days). Of the 817 with DVTs, 289 (35%) were symptomatic and 39 (5%) had pulmonary embolism (PE) confirmed by imaging. Six hundred and seventy-six (83%) were unilateral, 141 (17%) were bilateral, 322 (39%) were limited to calf veins, 172 (21%) were popliteal, and 323 (40%) were femoral. Among the 542 patients with DVT and a weak leg, the DVT affected the weaker leg in 396 (73%), the stronger leg in 59 (11%), and was bilateral in 87 (16%). Among the 318 patients with a DVT detected on the first CDU scan who had a second scan, the DVT regressed in 148 (47%), stayed the same in 140 (44%), and progressed in only 30 (9%).

- **Conclusions**: Although most DVTs develop within the first week, some develop later, and some early DVTs progress. Any prophylaxis needs to be started early to effectively manage DVT in stroke patients.

### Sedentary behaviors and venous thromboembolism risk among older women: the Objective Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Health study [^116SBmrk]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). High credibility.

Venous stasis, which can occur with prolonged sedentary behavior (SB), is associated with venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk, but VTE risk associated with accelerometer-measured SB has not been quantified.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate accelerometer-based measures of SB in relation to incident VTE.

- **Methods**: We included 5,591 participants, aged 63 to 99 years, of the Women's Health Initiative Objective Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Health cohort study without prior VTE. Between May 2012 and April 2014, participants wore the ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer at the hip for 7 days. Three SB measures were classified using the Convolutional Neural Network Hip Accelerometer Posture algorithm: total sitting time, mean sitting bout duration, and total time spent in prolonged (≥ 30 minutes) sitting bouts. VTE events were centrally adjudicated. Multivariable-adjusted Cox models estimated hazard ratios for each SB and VTE risk. Women were censored at first VTE, death, loss to follow-up, or February 2023. Mediation by body mass index (BMI) was evaluated.

- **Results**: Over a mean follow-up of 8.2 years, 229 women experienced a VTE. In adjusted models, longer mean sitting bout duration was associated with greater incident VTE risk (hazard ratio per 5-minute increase, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.04–1.28). BMI mediated approximately 30% of this association (P < .01). We found no significant evidence that total sitting time or total time spent in prolonged sitting bouts were associated with VTE.

- **Conclusion**: Longer mean sitting bout duration was associated with greater VTE risk, with substantial mediation by BMI in this association.

### Risk factors for deep vein thrombosis in older patients: a multicenter study with systematic compression ultrasonography in postacute care facilities in France [^1149fGAF]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2008). Low credibility.

To identify risk factors for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in older patients with restricted mobility or functional disability, a cross-sectional study was conducted. The study took place in 42 postacute care departments in France and included 812 patients aged 65 and older.

Twenty-two predefined characteristics were investigated, including medical and surgical risk factors, dependence in six basic activities of daily living (ADLs) rated using the Katz index, mobility, the reported value of the Timed Up and Go Test, and pressure ulcers. All patients underwent lower limb ultrasonography on the day of the cross-sectional study.

DVT was found in 113 patients (14%), with 33 proximal DVTs (4%) and 80 isolated distal DVTs (10%). A positive trend was found in the odds of DVT for higher values on the Timed Up and Go Test for patients who were not bedridden or confined to a chair (P = 0.007). In a two-level multivariable analysis adjusting for prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism, independent risk factors for DVT included age 80 and older (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.05–2.79), previous history of venous thromboembolism (aOR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.06–3.87), regional or metastatic-stage cancer (aOR = 2.71, 95% CI = 1.27–5.78), dependence in more than three ADLs (aOR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.38–3.45), and pressure ulcers (aOR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.05–3.24).

In conclusion, severe dependence in basic ADLs and a higher Timed Up and Go Test score are associated with greater odds of DVT in older patients in postacute care facilities in France.

### Venous thromboembolism: A public health concern [^112yJXag]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), defined as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or both, affects an estimated 300,000–600,000 individuals in the U.S. each year, causing considerable morbidity and mortality. It is a disorder that can occur in all races and ethnicities, all age groups, and both genders. With many known risk factors — advanced age, immobility, surgery, obesity — on the rise in society, VTE is an important and growing public health problem.

Recently, a marked increase has occurred in federal and national efforts to raise awareness and acknowledge the need for VTE prevention. Yet, many basic public health functions — surveillance, research, and awareness — are still needed. Learning and understanding more about the burden and causes of VTE, and raising awareness among the public and healthcare providers through a comprehensive public health approach, has enormous potential to prevent and reduce death and morbidity from deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism throughout the U.S.

### Fragmin [^113Sp3Zh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In a double-blind, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, general medical patients with severely restricted mobility who were at risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) were randomized to receive either FRAGMIN 5,000 units or placebo subcutaneously once daily during days 1 to 14 of the study. These patients had an acute medical condition requiring a projected hospital stay of at least 4 days and were confined to bed during waking hours. The study included patients with congestive heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV), acute respiratory failure not requiring ventilatory support, and the following acute conditions with at least one risk factor occurring in more than 1% of treated patients: acute infection (excluding septic shock), acute rheumatic disorder, acute lumbar or sciatic pain, vertebral compression, or acute arthritis of the lower extremities.

Risk factors included being over 75 years of age, cancer, previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE), obesity, and chronic venous insufficiency. A total of 3,681 patients were enrolled and treated: 1,848 received FRAGMIN and 1,833 received placebo. The mean age of the study population was 69 years (range 26 years to 99 years); 92.1% were white and 51.9% were female. The primary efficacy endpoint was evaluated at day 21 and was defined as at least one of the following within days 1 to 21 of the study: asymptomatic DVT (diagnosed by compression ultrasound), a confirmed symptomatic DVT, a confirmed pulmonary embolism or sudden death.

### Obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and video games: The new thrombophilia cocktail in adolescents [^113tK76v]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Rates of venous thromboembolism have increased in the adolescent population over the last two decades, likely due to advanced diagnostics, increased use of central venous catheters, chronic medical conditions, obesity, and oral contraceptive use. Of these factors, a modifiable risk factor for adolescents is obesity. A sedentary lifestyle and prolonged immobilization are additional prothrombotic risk factors that are often associated with obesity. With ever-increasing screen time, sedentary behavior has risen accordingly, especially among gamers. We present four cases of adolescents who developed life-threatening venous thromboembolic events in the setting of obesity, a sedentary lifestyle and/or immobilization, and prolonged video game use.

### Physical activity in patients with deep venous thrombosis: A systematic review [^113XmQ2H]. Thrombosis Research (2008). Low credibility.

We performed a systematic review to assess the benefits or risks of physical activity in patients with an acute or previous deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of the leg.

- **Data sources**: PubMed, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index were searched without language restrictions up to July 2007. Bibliographies of retrieved articles and personal files were also searched.

- **Review methods**: Randomized trials and prospective cohort studies that included patients with acute or previous DVT, described an exercise intervention or exercise exposure, and described any related clinical outcome were selected. Data were independently extracted by two investigators.

- **Results**: Seven randomized trials and two prospective observational studies were included. Early exercise, compared with bed rest, was associated with a similar short-term risk of pulmonary embolism in patients with acute DVT and led to more rapid resolution of limb pain. In patients with acute DVT, a six-month daily walking program led to similar degrees of vein recanalization and improvement in quality of life as controls. In patients with previous DVT, 30 minutes of vigorous treadmill exercise did not worsen venous symptoms and improved calf muscle flexibility; a six-month exercise training program improved calf muscle strength and pump function. High levels of physical activity at one month tended to be associated with reduced severity of postthrombotic symptoms during the subsequent three months.

- **Conclusions**: Early walking exercise is safe in patients with acute DVT and may help to reduce acute symptoms. Exercise training does not increase leg symptoms acu…

### Tuning the thromboinflammatory response to venous flow interruption by the ectonucleotidase CD39 [^111MKBUa]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2019). Low credibility.

Leukocyte flux contributes to thrombus formation in deep veins under pathological conditions, but mechanisms that inhibit venous thrombosis are incompletely understood. Ectonucleotide di(tri)phosphohydrolase 1 (ENTPD1 or CD39), an ectoenzyme that catabolizes extracellular adenine nucleotides, is embedded on the surface of endothelial cells and leukocytes. We hypothesized that under venous stasis conditions, CD39 regulates inflammation at the vein:blood interface in a murine model of deep vein thrombosis.

CD39-null mice developed significantly larger venous thrombi under venous stasis, with more leukocyte recruitment compared with wild-type mice. Gene expression profiling of wild-type and CD39-null mice revealed 76 differentially expressed inflammatory genes that were significantly upregulated in CD39-deleted mice after venous thrombosis, and validation experiments confirmed high expression of several key inflammatory mediators. P-selectin, known to have proximal involvement in venous inflammatory and thrombotic events, was upregulated in CD39-null mice. Inferior vena caval ligation resulted in thrombosis and a corresponding increase in both P-selectin and VWF (von Willebrand factor) levels, which were strikingly higher in mice lacking the CD39 gene. These mice also manifested an increase in circulating platelet-leukocyte heteroaggregates, suggesting heterotypic crosstalk between the coagulation and inflammatory systems, which is amplified in the absence of CD39.

These data suggest that CD39 mitigates the venous thromboinflammatory response.

### In-hospital risks and management of deep venous thrombosis according to location of the thrombus [^111Bv5gv]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Whether deep venous thrombosis involving the pelvic veins or inferior vena cava is associated with higher in-hospital mortality or a higher prevalence of in-hospital pulmonary embolism than proximal or distal lower extremity deep venous thrombosis is not known.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective cohort study based on administrative data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample for the years 2016 and 2017. Patients hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis at known locations were identified by International Classification of Diseases-10-Clinical Modification codes.

- **Results**: In-hospital all-cause mortality with deep venous thrombosis involving the inferior vena cava in patients treated only with anticoagulants was 2.2%, versus 0.8% with pelvic vein deep venous thrombosis (p < 0.0001), 0.7% with proximal deep venous thrombosis (p < 0.0001), and 0.2% with distal deep venous thrombosis (p < 0.0001). Mortality with anticoagulants was similar for pelvic vein deep venous thrombosis compared with proximal lower extremity deep venous thrombosis, 0.8% versus 0.7% (p = 0.39). Lower mortality was shown with pelvic vein deep venous thrombosis treated with thrombolytics than with anticoagulants, 0% versus 0.8% (p < 0.0001). In-hospital pulmonary embolism occurred in 11% to 23%, irrespective of the site of deep venous thrombosis.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with deep venous thrombosis involving the inferior vena cava had higher in-hospital mortality than patients with deep venous thrombosis at other locations. Pelvic vein deep venous thrombosis did not result in higher mortality or more in-ho…

### Acute lower extremity deep venous thrombosis: The data, where we are, and how it is done [^1172Ldqr]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

The incidence of venous thromboembolism, including both deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is estimated at 300,000–600,000 per year. Although thrombosis may occur anywhere, it is thrombosis of the deep veins of the lower extremities that is of interest as this is where thrombosis occurs most often within the venous system. This article discusses the evaluation and interventions, including endovascular catheter-direct treatments, for patients with acute deep venous thrombosis.

### Venous thrombosis unchained: Pandora's box of noninflammatory mechanisms [^111cPV6s]. Blood Advances (2025). High credibility.

Venous thromboembolism, which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, represents a complex pathological process extending far beyond inflammatory mechanisms. This review comprehensively examines the multifaceted noninflammatory mechanisms underlying thrombosis development, integrating insights from molecular, physiological, and systemic levels. Blood flow dynamics and endothelial function are known to be critical regulators of thrombus development. Platelets and microparticles play important roles beyond conventional inflammatory responses, actively contributing to thrombus formation through intricate molecular interactions.

Metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance are associated with thrombotic risk, demonstrating the complex interplay between metabolic disorders and DVT. Certain genetic mutations also predispose individuals to venous thrombosis. Emerging research has discovered the essential role of previously underappreciated factors such as products of gut microbiota or endothelial glycocalyx modifications. Molecular regulators such as microRNAs and hormonal disbalance further illustrate the complex mechanisms of venous thrombosis. Interestingly, circadian rhythms exhibit certain influence on thrombotic potential, introducing chronobiology as an emerging variable affecting the risk of thrombosis. Based on these insights, future therapeutic strategies may include various interventions targeting or at least considering metabolic, molecular, and systemic noninflammatory factors. Potential approaches include personalized risk stratification.

### Explanations for coagulation activation after air travel [^115ZuL9A]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2010). Low credibility.

It is unknown whether venous thrombosis after long-haul air travel is solely attributable to immobilization. We aimed to determine whether other mechanisms, such as hypoxia, stress, inflammation, or viral infection, were involved.

In a case-crossover setting with 71 healthy volunteers who were exposed to an 8-hour flight, an 8-hour movie marathon, and 8 hours of regular activities, we compared markers for several hypothetical pathways: plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), stress, plasma factor (F)VIII coagulant activity (FVIIIc), soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and neutrophil elastase. We previously reported an activated clotting system evidenced by thrombin generation in 17% of volunteers after the flight.

- **Results**: PAI-1 levels increased by 4.2 ng mL(-1) (CI95: -49.5 to 6.5) in volunteers with an activated clotting system, whereas they decreased in those without (-20.0 ng mL(-1), CI95: -33.2 to -14.0). FVIIIc levels rose more in individuals with clotting activation (18.0%, CI95: -1.0 to 33.0) than in those without (2.0%, CI95: -2.0 to 5.0). These increases in FVIIIc were not associated with stress, which appeared unrelated to clotting activation. sP-selectin increased in individuals with clotting activation (3.5 μg L(-1), CI95: -3.0 to 10.0), but decreased in those without (-0.5 μg L(-1), CI95: -2.0 to 2.0). Changes in levels of neutrophil elastase or IL-8 were consistent across subjects regardless of clotting activation status.

Our findings do not support the hypotheses that stress, infection, or air pollution are significant contributors to coagulation activation after air travel.
