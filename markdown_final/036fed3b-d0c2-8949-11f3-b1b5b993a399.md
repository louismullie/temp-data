## Question

Patient had paracentesis with 5L fluid removed and is now hypotensive

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage hypotension after 5 liters of ascitic fluid were removed by paracentesis in a patient with cirrhosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction and why 5 liters matters. Then, I should verify guideline-based albumin dosing and timing. Next, I will assess immediate hemodynamic stabilization and monitoring. After that, I need to check for precipitating factors like infection, bleeding, or renal injury. Finally, I will consider special scenarios, documentation, and follow-up planning, including when to escalate to vasoconstrictors or TIPS evaluation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and mechanism. Removing 5 liters of ascitic fluid acutely decompresses the abdomen, which can precipitate paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction by worsening effective arterial underfilling in cirrhosis, activating the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone and sympathetic systems, and leading to hypotension, hyponatremia, and renal injury. This risk is real even at 5 liters, and higher with larger volumes or in acute-on-chronic liver failure, so I should not minimize it even though some older guidance framed "large volume" as strictly > 5 L [^c64b1d0b] [^453ceae3] [^06fc841f].

> Wait, let me verify the albumin recommendation and dose. Multiple high-credibility guidelines converge on giving intravenous albumin for paracentesis of 5 liters or more, with a standard dose of 6–8 g per liter of ascites removed, typically using 20–25% albumin. For 5 liters, that equals 30–40 g, and it should be infused during or immediately after the procedure, not delayed, to mitigate PICD and preserve renal perfusion [^389d6515] [^fb3e26a7] [^7551fed9] [^70808664].

> Hold on, I should verify whether 5 liters exactly changes practice. Some guidance historically emphasized albumin primarily when more than 5 liters are removed, but contemporary best-practice advice recognizes that 5 liters already carries risk, especially in decompensated cirrhosis or ACLF, and supports albumin at 6–8 g/L for volumes of 5 liters or more. So yes, 5 liters warrants albumin now, and I should not withhold it [^fb3e26a7] [^389d6515] [^7551fed9].

> I need to ensure immediate hemodynamic management is correct. Place the patient supine with legs elevated, start continuous blood pressure and heart rate monitoring, and establish reliable IV access. If hypotension persists, give a bolus of 25% albumin 40 g (for 5 L removed) over about 2–4 hours, and reassess blood pressure, urine output, and mental status frequently. Avoid routine crystalloids here because they are less effective at restoring effective arterial blood volume in cirrhosis and may worsen edema; albumin is the preferred colloid in this setting [^389d6515] [^fb3e26a7] [^d6d71cf0].

> Next, I should review precipitating factors and complications. I will check for infection, including spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, because infection can both precipitate hypotension and be masked in cirrhosis. If SBP is suspected, I should obtain diagnostic paracentesis and start empiric antibiotics, and if SBP is confirmed, add albumin 1.5 g/kg day 1 and 1 g/kg day 3 to reduce renal failure and mortality. I also need to check for gastrointestinal bleeding, electrolyte disturbances, and evolving acute kidney injury, and I should hold nonselective beta-blockers if hypotension or AKI is present [^10cc2d7a] [^bdfa886c] [^7ce3e847].

> Let me consider special scenarios. If the patient is in ACLF or has baseline renal dysfunction, the threshold for albumin is lower and even modest-volume paracentesis can provoke PICD. In those cases, albumin at 8 g/L is reasonable even if less than 5 liters are removed. Conversely, if the patient is volume overloaded with pulmonary edema, I should be cautious with albumin and prioritize close monitoring for fluid shifts, but I should not withhold indicated albumin after 5-liter paracentesis; instead, I will titrate diuretics afterward once hemodynamics stabilize [^06fc841f] [^422f9bdc] [^fb3e26a7].

> I should double-check the evidence base to avoid overstatement. Meta-analyses show albumin reduces PICD and may reduce mortality compared with alternatives, though many trials are small and at risk of bias. Still, guideline consensus supports albumin for LVP, and the balance of benefits versus harms favors albumin in this setting, especially when 5 liters or more are removed [^060499d6] [^364f6cf1] [^389d6515].

> Next, I should review documentation and follow-up. I will record the exact volume removed, the albumin dose and timing, pre- and post-procedure vitals, urine output, electrolytes, and creatinine. I will plan reassessment at 6–12 hours for PICD markers and again at 48–72 hours for renal function, and I will adjust diuretics after stabilization. If hypotension recurs or renal function worsens, I should reconsider vasoconstrictor therapy and evaluate for TIPS in refractory ascites, coordinating with hepatology and transplant teams as indicated [^453ceae3] [^cefa11fa] [^001c8295].

> But wait, what if hypotension persists despite albumin and correction of precipitating factors? In that case, I should escalate to vasoconstrictors such as terlipressin or norepinephrine if hepatorenal syndrome–acute kidney injury is suspected, while continuing albumin, and I should involve critical care early. I need to ensure I am not missing alternative causes of shock such as sepsis or bleeding, and I should tailor resuscitation to the underlying driver rather than reflexively giving more fluids [^0e60b9db] [^7ce3e847].

> In summary, I should act now: give 40 g of 20–25% albumin promptly for 5 liters removed, monitor closely for PICD and complications, evaluate for infection and bleeding, hold NSBBs if hypotensive, and arrange follow-up labs and reassessment. This aligns with AASLD, AGA, and BASL/BSG guidance and addresses the pathophysiology of post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction [^389d6515] [^fb3e26a7] [^7551fed9].

Hypotension after 5L paracentesis is most often due to **paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction** (PICD) [^c64b1d0b], characterized by effective hypovolemia from sudden removal of ascitic fluid and neurohormonal activation [^bb40dd21]. Immediate management is **albumin 40g IV** (8g/L removed) [^389d6515] [^7551fed9] given during or within 6 hours of paracentesis [^notfound], with close monitoring of blood pressure, urine output, and renal function [^notfound]. If hypotension persists, consider vasoconstrictors (e.g. midodrine or terlipressin) [^0e60b9db] and evaluate for infection, bleeding, or renal injury [^7ce3e847]. Prevent recurrence by limiting single-session volumes, using albumin for > 5L removals, and reassessing diuretics and beta-blockers [^453ceae3] [^fb3e26a7] [^1388dbcd].

## Pathophysiology of hypotension after large-volume paracentesis

Hypotension after large-volume paracentesis is primarily due to **PICD**, which results from:

- **Effective hypovolemia**: Sudden removal of large volumes of ascitic fluid reduces intra-abdominal pressure, causing fluid shifts from the intravascular to the peritoneal cavity and leading to relative hypovolemia [^c64b1d0b].

- **Neurohormonal activation**: The resulting effective hypovolemia triggers activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), sympathetic nervous system, and antidiuretic hormone (ADH), causing vasoconstriction, sodium and water retention, and renal vasoconstriction [^c64b1d0b].

- **Hemodynamic instability**: These changes can lead to hypotension, tachycardia, oliguria, and acute kidney injury (AKI) [^8394a36c].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting albumin administration

Albumin administration is the cornerstone of preventing and managing PICD. The **AASLD recommends albumin infusion** at a dose of 8g per liter of ascitic fluid removed (typically 40g for 5L) [^389d6515] during or within 6 hours of paracentesis [^notfound]. This practice is supported by multiple studies and meta-analyses demonstrating significant reductions in PICD, renal dysfunction, and mortality [^060499d6] [^57539a09].

---

## Immediate management of hypotension after 5L paracentesis

### Initial assessment and monitoring

- **Vital signs**: Continuous monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.

- **Urine output**: Strict monitoring of urine output to assess renal perfusion.

- **Laboratory tests**: Serum electrolytes, renal function tests, and complete blood count.

---

### Fluid resuscitation

Administer **albumin 40g IV** (8g/L of ascitic fluid removed) during or within 6 hours of paracentesis [^389d6515] [^7551fed9]. If albumin is unavailable, consider alternative colloids or vasoconstrictors, though albumin remains the first-line therapy [^132996f7].

---

### Vasoconstrictor therapy

If hypotension persists despite albumin administration, consider **vasoconstrictors** such as midodrine or terlipressin to restore effective arterial blood volume and improve hemodynamic stability [^0e60b9db].

---

### Evaluation for complications

Assess for **infection**, including spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), which can exacerbate hypotension and renal dysfunction [^10cc2d7a]. Also evaluate for **bleeding** — gastrointestinal bleeding is common in cirrhosis and can contribute to hypotension — and monitor for **acute kidney injury**, as PICD can precipitate AKI, necessitating close monitoring and supportive care [^d68d3076].

---

## Preventive strategies for future paracentesis

To minimize the risk of recurrent hypotension, the following **preventive strategies** are recommended:

- **Limit single-session volume**: Avoid removing more than 5 liters of ascitic fluid in a single session when possible [^notfound].

- **Routine albumin administration**: Administer albumin for any paracentesis exceeding 5 liters [^389d6515] [^7551fed9].

- **Gradual fluid removal**: Consider staged paracentesis with albumin support for large-volume ascites.

- **Patient selection**: Identify patients at high risk for PICD (e.g. those with renal dysfunction, hyponatremia, or acute-on-chronic liver failure) and tailor albumin dosing accordingly [^453ceae3] [^06fc841f].

---

## Long-term management considerations

Long-term management focuses on **addressing the underlying cirrhosis and ascites**:

- **Dietary sodium restriction**: Essential for controlling ascites recurrence [^001c8295].

- **Diuretic therapy**: Careful titration of spironolactone and furosemide to maintain euvolemia and prevent recurrent tense ascites [^001c8295].

- **Beta-blocker use**: Non-selective beta-blockers may be continued cautiously, but dose adjustments may be necessary if hypotension or renal dysfunction occurs [^1388dbcd].

- **Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS)**: Considered for refractory ascites to reduce the need for repeated paracentesis [^001c8295].

---

Hypotension after 5L paracentesis is most often due to **PICD**, driven by effective hypovolemia and neurohormonal activation. Immediate albumin administration is the key intervention, with vasoconstrictors and complication screening as needed. Preventive strategies — limiting single-session volumes, routine albumin for > 5L removals, and careful patient selection — reduce recurrence risk, while long-term management addresses the underlying cirrhosis and ascites.

AASLD Practice Guidance — Albumin in critically ill cirrhosis notes that albumin administration is recommended in the management of patients with cirrhosis for select indications (large-volume paracentesis, paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [SBP], and hepatorenal syndrome [HRS]). In single-institution open-label RCTs, 20% albumin versus Plasma-Lyte in 100 patients with sepsis-induced hypotension had higher rates of shock reversal but no survival benefit and increased pulmonary complications, and 5% albumin versus normal saline in 308 patients with sepsis-induced hypotension had higher reversal of hypotension with higher 1-week survival (43.5% vs. 38.3%, p = 0.03). There are no large RCT specific to the use of albumin in patients with ACLF; in the Albumin to Prevent Infection in Chronic Liver Failure trial, 777 hospitalized patients with decompensated cirrhosis were randomized to daily albumin infusions versus standard care with no difference in the composite primary endpoint and possible higher rates of pulmonary edema and fluid overload, and overall its broader use as a resuscitation agent in critically ill patients with cirrhosis and/or ACLF is not well defined.

Rationale for Recommendations

Approximately one-third of albumin is used for patients with cirrhosis, and although this practice is exceedingly common, the certainty of evidence supporting this therapy in this population is insufficient to allow for strong recommendations. Although the use of albumin for large-volume paracentesis is a commonly accepted clinical practice and is endorsed by guidelines, the reported trials have important limitations that affect the certainty in outcomes. These trials included a small number of patients and findings for most patient-important outcomes (mortality, kidney dysfunction) were imprecise, leaving residual uncertainty regarding true clinical benefits and harms. Albumin, as compared with other fluid expanders, may be superior for the prevention of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (rise in serum renin level on the sixth day after paracentesis), but whether this translates to improvement in patient-important outcomes is less certain. Plasma renin levels are predictive of greater morbidity in patients with cirrhosis. The panel suggested continuing this commonly accepted practice for patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis, but believed the data supported only a conditional recommendation based on low-quality evidence. Further trials are needed urgently to clarify if albumin improves patient important outcomes, to elucidate the optimal dosing strategy, to further the understanding of the safety profile of the treatment, and to evaluate alternative fluids and therapies. It is unclear if improving laboratory measures of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction will translate into reductions in renal failure, hospital admission, or other patient-important outcomes. The panel also highlighted the need to personalize the use of albumin, the dose after paracentesis, or both, considering the patient's baseline creatinine, volume of ascites removed, and history of hypotensive symptoms after prior procedures.

The mainstay of ascites management in the outpatient setting is diuretic therapy. This involves a stepwise approach as outlined in figure 3 with the additional specific recommendations:

Secondary antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered in patients with a previous episode of SBP. Suitable antibiotic choices are norfloxacin 400 mg, ciprofloxacin 500 mg or co-trimoxazole 960 mg once daily. The ASEPTIC trial, investigating the role of primary prophylaxis of SBP, is ongoing. Some centres offer primary prophylaxis for those considered high risk of SBP (protein concentration < 15 g/L)but there are concerns around antibiotic resistance and this should only be considered following discussion with local microbiology teams. Rifaximin prescribed for secondary prophylaxis of HE may negate the prescription of a second oral systemic antibiotic with substantial evidence to suggest it prevents SBP.
NSBB, when indicated, is not contraindicated in refractory ascites; although patients require close monitoring; dose reduction or discontinuation may be appropriate in those who develop hypotension or acute/progressive renal dysfunction.
Long-term outpatient albumin administration to patients with cirrhosis and ascites is not currently recommended: despite encouraging results from the ANSWER trial, the accompanying medical supervision was a strong confounding variable; further research is required to determine the efficacy, practicality, cost-effectiveness and impact on quality of life.
Patients with refractory ascites requiring regular large-volume paracentesis should have them performed as planned day case procedures as this reduces costs and improves patient outcomes, particularly in the last year of life.
Indwelling abdominal drains remain experimental but can be considered in palliative patients with advanced disease as an alternative to recurrent large volume paracentesis following careful discussion involving the patient about the risk benefit ratio, and in particular the potential infection risk. Their use is currently being evaluated in the REDUCe2 trial.

### Understanding the mechanisms of paracentesis-induced crculatory dysfunction [^c64b1d0b]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Large-volume paracentesis induces early beneficial haemodynamic changes that may be shortly followed by a disorder known as paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction, characterized by a marked activation of the renin-angiotensin axis. Evidence is accumulating however that this disorder is secondary to an accentuation of an already established arteriolar vasodilatation. The causes of this syndrome are probably multiple and may include the dynamics of paracentesis (the rate of ascitic fluid extraction), release of nitric oxide from the vascular endothelium and mechanical modifications due to abdominal decompression. Patients developing this syndrome are prone to a faster reaccumulation of ascites, renal impairment and shorter survival. Plasma volume expansion after paracentesis reduces the incidence of this disorder. Preliminary evidence suggests that other approaches, such as the use of splanchnic vasoconstrictors or modulating the rate of ascitic fluid extraction, could be also effective, although more studies are needed.

Treatment of HRS

Recognition of AKI is the most important first step in its management in cirrhosis (Figure 2). It requires frequent monitoring of the sCr levels, especially in patients with potential precipitating factors. These include events that can either disturb the already precarious hemodynamics further or worsen the extent of inflammation. Examples include infection, be it bacterial or fungal, intravascular volume loss such as excessive diuresis or diarrhea, or an inflammatory condition such as alcoholic hepatitis. Once the diagnosis of AKI is confirmed, the initial step in the management is to remove and treat the precipitating factors to prevent further worsening of the kidney injury. It is also important to decide the stage of kidney injury to initiate appropriate therapy without delay. A urinalysis is always recommended to rule out structural causes of AKI by identifying hematuria or proteinuria, or various casts. A full septic workup including culturing samples from all possible sites as infection was found to be the most common precipitating factor of AKI in patients with cirrhosis. Other general measures in the management of AKI includes withdrawal of diuretics, volume expansion or resuscitation, and adjustment of lactulose dose if there is lactulose-induced diarrhea leading to dehydration. Appropriate volume resuscitation with colloid solutions, such as albumin, should be initiated in patients with intravascular volume loss due to excessive diuretics use and large-volume paracentesis (LVP). Patients with gastrointestinal blood loss should be resuscitated with packed red blood cells. Use of nephrotoxic drugs or radiographic dye should be avoided. Non-selective beta blockers (NSBBs) are commonly used in patients with decompensated cirrhosis as a prophylaxis against variceal bleeding. In patients with AKI who are on an NSBB, withholding NSBB should be considered, especially if there is systemic hypotension. These general measures may lead to improvement in renal function, especially in patients who have prerenal azotemia. The diagnosis of HRS-AKI is therefore one of diagnosis of exclusion. Patients with HRS-AKI are not volume responsive and therefore their sCr either stays unchanged or increases further despite these measures. Patients with HRS-AKI by definition have stage 2 AKI. As urine output in these patients is invariably low, it is tempting to insert a urinary catheter to monitor the urine output. However, that also increases the chance for urinary tract infection, and therefore should be avoided if possible.

### Towards goal-directed therapy of hepatorenal syndrome: we have the tools but we need the trials [^1b921ce1]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with cirrhosis who develop tense ascites and hepatorenal syndrome have a very high mortality and present a management challenge. Current debate stems from a lack of studies evaluating changes in effective arterial blood volume following paracentesis or targeting fluid replacement with appropriate vascular physiological measures to ensure no paracentesis-related circulatory dysfunction. The study by Umgelter and colleagues addresses a goal-directed approach to fluid management in hepatorenal syndrome and raises several mechanistic questions, the answers to which are likely to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology in hepatorenal syndrome and to guide future management.

### Emergency diagnostic paracentesis to determine intraperitoneal fluid identity discovered on bedside ultrasound of unstable patients [^ea67c382]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with hypotension may be evaluated with a FAST (Focused Abdominal Sonography for Trauma) examination as recent literature has suggested its utility in the unstable patient. Those who are found to have intraperitoneal fluid on the FAST examination may have solid organ injury from unknown trauma, ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), hemorrhaging ovarian cyst, ruptured ectopic pregnancy, or other disease process responsible for intra-periteal blood. However, because ultrasound does not assist in fluid identification, it is possible that the fluid present is not blood, but ascites. Further, a decision may need to be made regarding emergent surgical intervention or blood transfusion vs. aggressive fluid resuscitation or pressors followed by other testing such as computed tomography. This case series illustrates the utility of an ultrasound guided, emergent diagnostic paracentesis in the management of unstable patients found to have a positive FAST examination. Six unstable patients were evaluated with the FAST examination and found to have large quantities of intraperitoneal fluid. In each case the fluid was sampled and proposed management changed due to fluid identification.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^154e3618]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Treatment of grade 3 ascites — initial management states that for patients presenting with tense ascites, large-volume paracentesis (LVP) combined with hyperoncotic human albumin is the initial treatment of choice, even in the presence of hyponatremia. Patients with massive peripheral edema may require a second paracentesis shortly after the first because a rapid shift of fluid may occur from interstitial to ascitic cavity. After LVP and a significant reduction in the intra-abdominal pressure, diuretics can be instituted, which may eliminate or reduce the frequency of paracentesis.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^10cc2d7a]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) initial management — First-line empirical antibiotic therapy for community-acquired SBP/SBE is IV third-generation cephalosporin, whereas in patients with a health care–associated or nosocomial infection or recent exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics or who are admitted with sepsis or septic shock, empirical therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated as the first line. Response to empirical antibiotic therapy may be assessed by repeating diagnostic paracentesis/thoracentesis 2 days after initiation, and a decrease in fluid PMN < 25% from baseline indicates lack of response and should lead to broadening of antibiotic coverage and further evaluation to rule out secondary bacterial peritonitis. Patients with SBP should be treated with IV albumin in addition to antibiotics (1.5 g/kg at day 1 and 1 g/kg at day 3), and patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) and/or jaundice at time of diagnosis of SBP are more likely to benefit from albumin. Nonselective beta blockers (NSBBs) should be temporarily held in patients with SBP who develop hypotension (mean arterial pressure < 65 mm Hg) or AKI.

### Effects of paracentesis on hemodynamic parameters and respiratory function in critically ill patients [^6d02a8fc]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this trial we analyzed the effects of paracentesis on hemodynamic parameters and respiratory function in critically ill patients.

According to the results of our study, no relevant impairment of circulatory function was observed whereas renal function in terms of urine output improved following removal of ascites. Furthermore, paracentesis is related to immediate and sustained improvement of respiratory function. The median oxygenation ratio of all patients increased, whereas PaCO 2 remained stable after paracentesis.

Patients with tense ascites often display signs of circulatory dysfunction. Portal hypertension leads to vasodilatation of splanchnic vessels, leading to decreased peripheral resistance, decreased effective central blood volume with consequent arterial hypotension and hyperdynamic circulation. These changes finally result in activation of vasoconstrictor systems, the renin-angiotensin-aldosteron system (RAAS) and the sympathetic nervous system, as well as increased levels of antidiuretic hormone, water retention and renal vasoconstriction, possibly ending in renal failure. Infusion of albumin is recommended by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) for large volume paracentesis (> 5 Liter), because intravenously administered albumin increases the effective arterial blood volume and improves serum sodium concentrations in patients with cirrhosis and severe hyponatremia. However, albumin does not interfere with the main mechanisms of ascites formation and therefore only prevents complications of paracentesis rather than prevents the recurrence of ascites.

Regarding medical management for portal hypertension, more specifically with respect to management of ascites, therapeutic paracentesis, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to administer albumin for plasma volume expansion in patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis of < 5 L of ascites, although the risk of developing post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction is low.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^453ceae3]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Large-volume paracentesis (LVP) in refractory ascites — definition, role, and albumin dosing are as follows: LVP, arbitrarily defined as a paracentesis of > 5 L, has been shown to be safe and effective in the management of RA, and LVP is the first-line treatment for RA. Albumin infusion at the time of LVP of > 5 L is recommended to mitigate the risk of postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction (PPCD); the recommended dose of albumin replacement, based on expert opinion, is 6–8 g for every liter of ascites removed, with practical examples that after the fifth liter, approximately 40 g of albumin should be infused, and after 8 L removed, the amount of albumin given should be approximately 64 g. The risk of PPCD may increase with > 8 L of fluid evacuated in one single session, and a recent study showed that by limiting the LVP volume to < 8 L per session and providing a higher than recommended dose of albumin (9.0 ± 2.5 g per liter of ascites removed), renal function and survival may be better preserved over a mean period of 2 years despite the development of PPCD in 40% of patients. In patients with hemodynamic instability (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg), hyponatremia (serum sodium < 130 mmol/L), and/or the presence of AKI, albumin infusion should be strongly considered for paracenteses of a smaller volume.

Use of human albumin solution (HAS)

Plasma expansion after paracentesis

One study evaluating haemodynamic and neurohumoral responses in 12 patients after a single, 5 L total paracentesis concluded that it was safe to omit albumin in these patients. However, a subsequent study including 80 patients with acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) found that albumin significantly reduced complications (renal impairment, hyponatraemia and death) following < 5 L paracentesis compared with no administration of fluid. Thus in < 5 L paracentesis we recommend that plasma expansion is not necessary, unless there is evidence of ACLF. This recommendation is based on consensus rather than evidence and is consistent with other international guidance.

Plasma volume expansion should always be used for LVP with > 5 L of ascites removed. Serial paracenteses with and without albumin replacement have been evaluated in patients with tense ascites. There was a higher rate of renal impairment, fall in serum sodium levels, and a marked activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system in those not treated with albumin. However, the pooled risk ratio from these studies, which are more than 25 years old, showed only a tendency toward benefit of albumin (pooled RR = 0.23, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.64) (online supplemental table 5). The consensus is that volume expansion should be used with LVP. We recommend large volume paracentesis in one session and discourage repeated low volume paracentesis, which offers no additional benefits and carries a higher risk of procedure-related complications.

Ascites and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis — albumin with paracentesis: Best Practice Advice 4 states that IV albumin should be administered at the time of large-volume (> 5 L) paracentesis. Although single 5-LVPs do not result in deleterious hemodynamic or renal effects, in an RCT including 105 patients with tense ascites, daily 5-L paracenteses unaccompanied by IV albumin were associated with AKI in 21% of patients; AKI did not occur in any patient receiving albumin.

### Acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) and international club of ascites (ICA) joint multidisciplinary consensus meeting [^d6d71cf0]. Journal of Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Fluid choice should be individualised and guided by specific patient condition: blood products in cases of gastrointestinal bleeding, crystalloids (preferentially balanced solutions such as lactated ringers or PlasmaLyte) in cases of volume depletion, and 20–25% albumin in those with SBP or HRS-AKI, with close attention to patient haemodynamics and volume status. Albumin is often used with the notion that it is more likely to maintain oncotic pressure than crystalloids; however, numerous RCTs in critically ill patients have failed to demonstrate any difference in 30-day or 90-day mortality or need for RRT between groups. In patients with advanced cirrhosis, not only does serum albumin concentration decrease, but its structure and anti-oxidant functions are also altered, reducing its capacity to bind to bacterial products and reactive oxygen species, potentially exacerbating systemic inflammation. Experimental studies suggest that infusion of normal "exogenous" albumin has beneficial effects on controlling systemic inflammation and improving circulatory status, which could also contribute to the prevention or reversal of AKI; however, this effect has not been observed in clinical practice. Results from two RCTs comparing albumin to crystalloids in patients with cirrhosis and sepsis-induced hypotension have been conflicting, which may be explained by differences in type of albumin solution (5% vs. 20%), type of crystalloid (0.9% saline vs. plasmalyte), and the short duration of the studies (7 vs. 28 days) (Table S3). Although the use of albumin was associated with a significantly greater improvement in haemodynamics in the short term, the response was not sustained and did not improve renal outcomes or need for RRT compared to crystalloids.

Interactions between ascites, IAP, and AKI are complex. In theory, IAP and intra-abdominal compartment syndrome related to large volume ascites may induce AKI by increasing central venous pressure and reducing right ventricular output, and thus CO. In critically ill patients with HRS and tense ascites, paracentesis plus albumin infusion resulted in an increase in creatinine clearance, which correlated with the decrease in IAP. However, LVP which reduces IAP is also known to trigger circulatory changes that may contribute to impaired kidney function without the use of albumin. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to support routine measurement of IAP in patients with tense ascites and no evidence to support systematic LVP in patients with increased IAP.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of ascites, volume overload, and hyponatremia in cirrhosis: expert review [^001c8295]. Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Description

The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Update (CPU) is to summarize the available evidence and offer expert Best Practice Advice (BPA) on the management of ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, volume overload, and hyponatremia in patients with cirrhosis.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Governing Board and Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership. This CPU expert review underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through the standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These BPA statements were developed based on review of the published literature and expert opinion and approved by the AGA Institute Governing Board. Because formal systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings of the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Patients with cirrhosis with ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, or volume overload should be managed with dietary sodium restriction and diuretics at the lowest effective dose, with dose escalation guided by symptoms, weight, urine output, and electrolyte/renal monitoring. Education and referral to a dietitian should be provided for dietary management. Triggers of liver decompensation should be identified and addressed. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Patients with cirrhosis with new-onset ascites, or those admitted to the hospital for symptoms related to ascites or encephalopathy should receive diagnostic paracentesis as soon as possible. Testing should include serum ascites albumin gradient and cell count, Gram stain, and culture. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Patients with hepatic hydrothorax with dyspnea and/or hypoxemia should undergo a therapeutic thoracentesis for both symptom relief and expansion of the underlying lung. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: All patients with refractory ascites and/or hepatic hydrothorax should be considered for liver transplantation evaluation, regardless of their Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Refractory ascites and/or hydrothorax should be managed with therapeutic paracentesis and/or thoracentesis, respectively, with the frequency guided by recurrence. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: When the volume of ascites removed is > 5 L, 20%-25% intravenous albumin 6–8 g per every total liter removed should be administered. For patients with hypotension, renal insufficiency, or electrolyte abnormalities, albumin should also be considered for removal of smaller volumes. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Well-selected patients with refractory ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, volume overload, or hyponatremia should be referred for to transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Diagnostic workup for the etiology of hyponatremia in cirrhosis should include dietary and medication history (diuretics, bowel regimen); review of electrolyte and kidney function; gastrointestinal bleeding assessment; infectious workup, including diagnostic paracentesis, and evaluation of secondary causes (thyroid or adrenal dysfunction). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Outpatient management of asymptomatic hypervolemic hyponatremia in liver cirrhosis entails both sodium and water restriction (aiming for 1–1.5 L of daily fluid intake), modification of diuretics and laxatives, and monitoring of electrolytes. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Inpatient management of severe or symptomatic hypervolemic hyponatremia in liver cirrhosis includes both sodium and water restriction; modification or discontinuation of diuretics and laxatives; and additional measures, such as intravenous albumin based on volume assessment or oral vasoconstriction therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Recurrent or refractory hyponatremia management should involve a multidisciplinary approach (including the liver transplantation team when appropriate) and can consider several therapeutic options, including intravenous vasoconstrictor therapy, infusion of hypertonic saline, use of vasopressin receptor antagonist (vaptans), or use of renal replacement therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Inpatient management of volume overload includes escalation or trial of intravenous loop diuretics (furosemide or bumetanide) in bolus (2–3 times per day) or continuous fashion. Cautious escalation can be done every 2–3 days with monitoring of volume status, kidney function, daily weights, and symptoms. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: Advanced strategies in refractory anasarca should be coordinated with nephrology for consideration of diuretics in the setting of contraction alkalosis (eg, addition of acetazolamide), second agent with alternate mechanism of actions (eg, thiazide diuretics, such as metolazone), or need for ultrafiltration.

Evidence Summary

We identified a 2019 Cochrane systematic review including 27 RCTs (N = 1,592) examining the use of any plasma volume expanders in patients with cirrhosis undergoing paracentesis. In general, enrolled patients were undergoing large-volume paracentesis (> 5 L), and the most commonly used albumin doses were either 6 to 8 g of albumin per 1 L of fluid removed or a standard dose of 20 to 40 g. Compared with no plasma expander, no statistically significant effect of using hyperoncotic (20%-25%) albumin on mortality (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.06–4.83), kidney impairment (RR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.02–5.88), or recurrence of ascites (RR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.49–3.42) was found. Compared with hyperoncotic albumin, use of other fluids showed uncertain effects on mortality (RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.82–1.30), kidney impairment (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.71–1.91), and recurrence of ascites (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.96–1.36). Paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction was more frequent with nonalbumin plasma expanders (RR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.31–2.99) compared with albumin. A 2020 systematic review focused on the impact of different therapies (albumin, other fluids, vasoactive drugs) on the rate of postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction and identified nine RCTs (N = 620). Albumin at a dose of 8 g/L was found to be superior to other volume expanders for the prevention of postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction (rise in plasma renin activity by ≥ 50% of baseline). Similar to the Cochrane review, uncertainty regarding the role of albumin as compared with alternative treatments was noted for the prevention of complications after paracentesis. RCTs comparing high-dose albumin (6–8 g/L of ascitic fluid removed) with low-dose albumin (2–4 g/L of ascitic fluid removed) found no difference in the rate of paracentesis associated circulatory dysfunction, although uncertainty exists regarding the risk to benefit profile of the two doses, given the small sample size (two studies [N = 120]; RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.22–4.49).

Pediatric cirrhosis with ascites — initial management and paracentesis support are specified as follows: Children with cirrhosis and ascites should be referred for evaluation for liver transplantation (LT). Ascites in children is initially managed with restricted sodium intake to below 2 mmol/kg per day and administration of spironolactone (1–4 mg/kg per day) and furosemide (1–3 mg/kg per day in divided doses). Children undergoing large-volume paracentesis (LVP) should receive 25% albumin infusion of 0.5–1.0 g/kg, or 6–8 g per liter of ascites removed. Diagnostic paracentesis should be performed in children with ascites and fever, abdominal pain, or clinical deterioration.

### Low-dose albumin infusion for the prevention of paracentesis induced circulatory dysfunction (PICD), after large volume paracentesis (LVP) in decompensated cirrhosis liver. (PICD LVP) [^bb40dd21]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

LVP, paracentesis of ascitic fluid > 5L, leading paracentesis induced circulatory dysfunction in approximately 80% cases, associated with rapid recurrence of ascites, dilutional hyponatremia, hepatorenal syndrome, and increased short-term mortality. PICD is defined as increase in plasma renin activity by > 50% of baseline to an absolute value of > 4ng/ml/h at 6th day, after paracentesis, resulting patients develop rapid reaccumulation of ascites, hyponatremia, renal injury, and hepatic encephalopathy. LVP results in mechanical decompression of the splanchnic vascular bed, leading vasodilation, a further decrease in the arterial filling, and activation of neurohormonal systems, that causes free water and sodium retention. Consequently, patients develop rapid reaccumulation of ascites, hyponatremia, renal injury, and hepatic encephalopathy.

The degree of activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and sympathetic nervous system 6 days after paracentesis correlates inversely, with changes in systemic vascular resistance. Within 60 minutes of paracentesis, a marked increase in cardiac output, together with a reduction in mean arterial pressure, and consequently calculated SVR significantly decreased. To observe and compare the length of hospital stay in both groups after large volume paracentesis. Materials and Methods. We will conduct a randomized control trial comparing low dose albumin infusion with standard dose albumin infusion preventing paracentesis induced circulatory dysfunction. Outcome of the study:

- The primary outcome is the incidence of PICD in both groups, 7 days after paracentesis.

The secondary outcomes are renal failure, hyponatremia, hepatic encephalopathy, development of hepatorenal syndrome, length of hospital stay, and mortality.

### AGA clinical practice update on the use of vasoactive drugs and intravenous albumin in cirrhosis: expert review [^0e60b9db]. Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Description

Cirrhosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and worldwide. It consists of compensated, decompensated, and further decompensated stages; median survival is more than 15 years, 2 years, and 9 months for each stage, respectively. With each stage, there is progressive worsening of portal hypertension and the vasodilatory-hyperdynamic circulatory state, resulting in a progressive decrease in effective arterial blood volume and renal perfusion. Vasoconstrictors reduce portal pressure via splanchnic vasoconstriction and are used in the management of variceal hemorrhage. Intravenous (IV) albumin increases effective arterial blood volume and is used in the prevention of acute kidney injury (AKI) and death after large-volume paracentesis and in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The combination of vasoconstrictors and albumin is used in the reversal of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS-AKI), the most lethal complication of cirrhosis. Because a potent vasoconstrictor, terlipressin, was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, and because recent trials have explored use of IV albumin in other settings, it was considered that a best practice update would be relevant regarding the use of vasoactive drugs and IV albumin in the following 3 specific scenarios: variceal hemorrhage, ascites and SBP, and HRS.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership. It underwent internal peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These Best Practice Advice statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Some of the statements are unchanged from published guidelines because of lack of new evidence in the literature. Because systematic reviews were not performed, these Best Practice Advice statements do not carry formal ratings regarding the quality and evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Vasoactive drugs should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis of variceal hemorrhage is suspected or confirmed, preferably before diagnostic and/or therapeutic endoscopy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: After initial endoscopic hemostasis, vasoactive drugs should be continued for 2–5 days to prevent early rebleeding. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Octreotide is the vasoactive drug of choice in the management of variceal hemorrhage based on its safety profile. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: IV albumin should be administered at the time of large-volume (> 5 L) paracentesis. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: IV albumin may be considered in patients with SBP. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Albumin should not be used in patients (hospitalized or not) with cirrhosis and uncomplicated ascites. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Vasoconstrictors should not be used in the management of uncomplicated ascites, after large-volume paracentesis or in patients with SBP. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: IV albumin is the volume expander of choice in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and ascites presenting with AKI. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Vasoactive drugs (eg, terlipressin, norepinephrine, and combination of octreotide and midodrine) should be used in the treatment of HRS-AKI, but not in other forms of AKI in cirrhosis. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Terlipressin is the vasoactive drug of choice in the treatment of HRS-AKI and use of concurrent albumin can be considered when accounting for patient's volume status. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Terlipressin treatment does not require intensive care unit monitoring and can be administered intravenously through a peripheral line. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Terlipressin use is contraindicated in patients with hypoxemia and in patients with ongoing coronary, peripheral, or mesenteric ischemia, and should be used with caution in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure grade 3. The benefits may not outweigh the risks in patients with serum creatinine > 5 mg/dL and in patients listed for transplantation with a Model for End-stage Liver Disease ≥ 35.

### Drug insight: the role of albumin in the management of chronic liver disease [^9a93c6a4]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Medium credibility.

Albumin is the most abundant protein in the circulation. Its main physiologic function is to maintain colloid osmotic pressure. Better understanding of albumin's other physiologic functions has expanded its application beyond maintenance of intravascular volume. In patients with cirrhosis, albumin has been used as an adjunct to diuretics to improve the diuretic response. It has also been used to prevent circulatory dysfunction developing after large-volume paracentesis. Newer indications in cirrhotic patients include preventing hepatorenal syndrome in those with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and treating established hepatorenal syndrome in conjunction with vasoconstrictor therapies. The use of albumin for many of these indications is controversial, mostly because of the paucity of well-designed, randomized, controlled trials. The cost of albumin infusions, lack of clear-cut benefits for survival, and fear of transmitting unknown viruses add to the controversy. The latest indication for albumin use in cirrhotic patients is extracorporeal albumin dialysis, which has shown promise for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy; its role in hepatorenal syndrome or acute on chronic liver failure has not been established. Efforts should be made to define the indications for albumin use, dose of albumin required and predictors of response, so that patients gain the maximum benefit from its administration.

### Albumin in decompensated cirrhosis: new concepts and perspectives [^073b9870]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Understanding circulatory abnormalities in cirrhosis led to development of several therapeutic strategies, which are currently used in clinical practice, to improve/prevent kidney complications, including blockade of sodium retaining factors and/or treatment with vasoconstrictor drugs. Some of these strategies include the intravenous administration of albumin with the objective of improving arterial underfilling. Currently, accepted indications of albumin include prevention of circulatory dysfunction following large-volume paracentesis, prevention of HRS in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and management of HRS in association with vasoconstrictor drugs.

On this background, the current article reviews the new concepts on pathogenesis of cirrhosis progression, in particular the role of systemic inflammation in the development of complications of cirrhosis and ACLF, and the potential role of albumin to prevent disease progression and reduce the inflammatory status.

### Large-volume paracentesis: a fast, convenient, and safe technique [^9fd4c7a8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Ascites is a common complication of liver cirrhosis, malignancy, cardiac failure, pancreatitis, and tuberculosis, with cirrhosis of the liver being the most common cause. Onset of ascites in cirrhosis of the liver is associated with worsened quality of life, increased risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and renal failure. Management of ascites caused by cirrhosis requires sodium restriction in diet, sodium excretion with diuretics and, in refractory cases, large volume paracentesis.

Technique

We describe a simple adjustment to the standard paracentesis technique that does not require additional equipment or manpower.

Conclusion

Removing over 5 L of ascitic fluid can become a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. We describe a setup that makes this commonly performed procedure fast, convenient, and safe.

### Reply [^487ebb23]. Liver Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

We would like to thank Drs. Kumar and Pillai for their interest in our article on the safety and feasibility of using the alfapump as a means of managing refractory ascites in patients with cirrhosis. The pump allows the daily continuous slow removal of ascites while maintaining a relative flat abdomen. Placement of the alfapump results in significant improvement in patient mobility, greater caloric intake, and, hence, better nutritional status and an overall improved quality of life.

Although the removal of ascites is associated with the development of postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction (PICD), albumin administration has been advocated in patients who undergo large‐volume paracentesis (LVP). However, in patients who are undergoing paracentesis of < 5 L, renal function may be unaffected by the fluid shift related to the paracentesis. In the study of Solà et al. activation of the vasoconstrictor systems only became evident when the pump rate was increased after day 7 following pump implantation, once again demonstrating that the development of PICD in decompensated cirrhosis is closely linked to the amount of volume shift during paracentesis. However, the activation of the vasoconstrictor systems appeared to be of limited clinical consequence because there was no change in either the cardiac output or in the mean arterial pressure in these patients. It should be noted that only 3 of the 18 episodes of acute kidney injury (AKI) observed in these patients were related to hypovolemia, and these were episodes of stage 1 AKI that resolved either spontaneously or with reduction of ascites removal volume. Therefore, mandating the universal use of albumin with the alfapump may not be advisable. Midodrine is also not required because the alfapump studies published to date have not reported hypotension either at baseline or with alfapump use. Finally, diuretics should also be stopped upon insertion of the alfapump because they are no longer required.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^3d73d7be]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Initial use of a restrictive volume replacement strategy is supported by a prospective randomised trial that analysed the consequences of an initial intra-hospital hypotensive resuscitation strategy in trauma patients with haemorrhagic shock. In this study, with nearly all of the 90 patients suffering from penetrating trauma, patients who had at least one documented in-hospital systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mmHg were randomised to a target minimum mean arterial pressure of 50 mmHg or 65 mmHg. One major drawback to this study was that no statistically significant difference between the actual mean arterial pressure was observed between the two groups over the duration of the study (64.4 mmHg vs. 68.5 mmHg, P = 0.15). Although the authors could not demonstrate a survival difference for the two treatment strategies at day 30, 24 h postoperative death and coagulopathy were increased in the group with the higher target minimum pressure. The patients in this group received not only more i.v. fluids overall, but also more blood product transfusions. Another study that supports a restrictive volume replacement strategy was reported by Brown et al. In this study 1216 trauma patients with an ISS > 15 were included; 51% suffered from hypotension, defined as a systolic arterial blood pressure (SAP) < 90 mmHg. 68% of the patients received a volume load of > 500 mL crystalloid solution. The authors demonstrated that administration of > 500 mL pre-hospital crystalloid was associated with worse outcome in patients without pre-hospital hypotension but not in patients with hypotension. The administration of > 500 mL crystalloid was associated with a correction of hypotension. The authors suggested that pre-hospital volume resuscitation should be goal-directed based on the presence or absence of hypotension. Recently, Schreiber et al. assessed the feasibility and safety of controlled resuscitation (n = 97) in hypotensive trauma patients compared to standard resuscitation (n = 95). Patients were enrolled and randomised in the pre-hospital setting. Eligible patients had a pre-hospital systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mmHg. Controlled resuscitation patients received 250 mL fluid if no radial pulse or an SAP < 70 mmHg was present and additional 250 mL boluses to maintain a radial pulse or a systolic blood pressure ≥ 70 mmHg. The mean (SD) crystalloid volume administered during the study period was 1.0 l (1.5) in the controlled resuscitation group and 2.0 l (1.4) in the standard resuscitation group. ICU-free days, ventilator-free days, renal injury and renal failure did not differ between the groups.

### Safety, cost-effectiveness and feasibility of daycase paracentesis in the management of malignant ascites with a focus on ovarian cancer [^72534d7b]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

The Hospital Episode Statistics suggest an average length of in-patient stay (LoS) for paracentesis of 4 days. This is due to the common practice of intermittent clamping of drains, because of a perceived risk of hypotension with free drainage, based on historical experience with paracentesis for transudative ascites due to hypo-albuminaemia and portal hypertension in patients with liver cirrhosis. These patients frequently require intravenous fluid replacement, and many gastroenterology units routinely co-administer human albumin solution. Malignant ascites develops as a consequence of peritoneal carcinomatosis, portal vein compression and lymphatic invasion. Recent preclinical and clinical data have also identified a key role of VEGF and increased vascular permeability in the development of ascites, as also demonstrated by the efficacy of bevacizumab and aflibercept in some patients. In view of the difference in the pathophysiology of malignant ascites, a recent study of 18 women (23 episodes of paracentesis) with ovarian cancer suggested that free drainage of malignant ascites was safe and did not cause significant hypotension. Similarly, have previously shown that free drainage is associated with only modest (6 mm Hg) fall in systolic blood pressure (SBP), but no changes in diastolic BP, and is safe. Because in-patient admissions limit the quality of life of patients with advanced disease; daycase paracentesis if possible is a potentially preferable alternative. However, the attempts ofto perform paracentesis as a daycase procedure was associated with a 44% admission rate due to incomplete drainage of ascites, whereas in another study in a hospice setting, daycase paracentesis achieved only partial fluid drainage.

Concerns over the risk of hypotension, the small size of the Decruze study, the lack of independent validation of their results and high admission or partial drainage rates continue to limit the adoption of daycase paracentesis clinically.

To address these issues, we audited our in-patient bed utilisation for paracentesis, and re-assessed the safety of free drainage of ascites. Reasons for high admission rates owing to partial drainage in the previous study related to delays in drain insertion and slow fluid drainage. To eliminate the need for in-patient admission while retaining high rates of complete drainage, we evaluated the feasibility of daycase paracentesis, with radiological insertion of drains instead of junior doctors. We also determined the cost-effectiveness of such a strategy relative to in-patient paracentesis.

### AGA clinical practice update on surgical risk assessment and perioperative management in cirrhosis: expert review [^82f90335]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — perioperative management of ascites in cirrhosis — states that ascites should be managed aggressively before surgical procedures and that, in patients with symptomatic ascites, large-volume total abdominal paracentesis should be performed preoperatively with intravenous albumin in a dose of 6–8 g for each liter of ascites fluid removed; once oral medications are tolerated, daily antibiotic prophylaxis can be resumed in patients with a history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or low ascites total protein; although preoperative antibiotics are of uncertain efficacy, an antibiotic such as ceftriaxone can be administered prophylactically in a dose of 1 g of every 24 hours intravenously until oral intake is possible again; preoperative thoracentesis is only recommended for moderate to large pleural effusions that compromise respiratory function, and administration of intravenous fluid and blood products should be limited perioperatively to avoid increasing extracellular volume, ascites, and portal venous pressure.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^132996f7]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Some debate remains over the use of albumin or artificial plasma expanders for volume expansion. Pooled analysis of 10 studiesfound that cirrhotic patients undergoing paracentesis who received albumin were no less likely to develop renal dysfunction than patients undergoing paracentesis that received an alternative plasma expander (pooled RR = 1.11, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.14) (online supplemental table 5). Analysis from two other independently conducted systematic reviews is consistent with these findings. Pooled analysis from eight studiesfound that cirrhotic patients undergoing paracentesis who received albumin were no less likely to die than those who received an alternate plasma expander (pooled RR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.12) (online supplemental table 6), which is supported by two systematic reviews. However, when all comparators to albumin (including control and vasoconstrictor alone) are pooled (16 RCTs) the RR is 0.77 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.00). This translates to 57 to 100 fewer patients per 1000 dying after LVP when HAS is used (online supplemental table 6).

Less clinically important outcomes have been shown to improve in patients treated with HAS versus other plasma expanders. There is a decreased incidence of post-paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (defined as a decrease in plasma renin) in patients undergoing LVP treated with albumin compared with an alternative plasma expander in a meta-analysis containing eight RCTs(OR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.51), and a pooled decrease in hyponatraemia in nine RCTs (OR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.93). Both are supported in a second independently conducted systematic review.

Most of the plasma expanders used in the described studies are no longer in use and have been restricted by the European Medicines Agency (eg, polygeline carries risk of prion transmission, dextran the risk of allergic reaction and hydroxyethyl starch association with renal impairment and deranged coagulation). Therefore, consensus is that volume expansion should be with HAS due to availability, familiarity of use and suggested benefits in the available studies.

### Open abdomen critical care management principles: resuscitation, fluid balance, nutrition, and ventilator management [^2d174220]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Managing the patient requiring emergent bedside decompression

The patient who develops ACS in the ICU can rapidly become unstable. These patients may become progressively hypotensive with transient response to fluid boluses, which lead to worsening ACS that, if unrecognized, leads to reduced pulmonary compliance and worsening respiratory acidosis, which contributes to the metabolic acidosis occurring as a result of hypoperfusion and in some instances hyperchloremia from overzealous use of normal saline. The resulting drop in pH further compromises cardiac output leading to further hypotension and hypoperfusion. Once recognized that ACS is present and the abdomen is opened at the bedside, the intensivist must be present to manage the patient's rapidly changing physiology. When managing the ventilator for these patients, it must be remembered that pulmonary damage occurring from high ventilator pressures occurs as a result of elevated pressures within the lung parenchyma; however, in ACS, the transpulmonary pressure is elevated, and overdistension of alveoli from these elevated pressures does not occur as it does from unopposed pressures delivered from high ventilator settings in a patient without ACS. Dropping tidal volumes to maintain lower airway pressures when a patient is developing ACS will lead to significant respiratory acidosis and hypoxia, which may be fatal in the acute setting as preparations are made to open the abdomen. Likewise, once the abdomen is opened, the ventilator must be immediately adjusted to maintain an appropriate tidal volume that does not overexpand the lung with the rapidly decompressed abdomen. Significant acid load can be washed out of the abdomen and enter the circulation, which can result in cardiovascular collapse. To combat this, maintaining an initial high minute ventilation and administering bicarbonate and calcium can combat these effects. Pulmonary compliance may also be affected by associated large pleural effusions that may benefit from thoracostomy drainage. Pulmonary hypertension secondary to hypercarbia and sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction may lead to right ventricular overload, which can be acutely worsened with the rapid increase in flow that results from opening the abdomen. This may necessitate the use of dobutamine or milrinone to improve ventricular function while simultaneously reducing pulmonary vascular pressure.

### Albumin treatment regimen for type 1 hepatorenal syndrome: a dose-response meta-analysis [^57539a09]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Furthermore, association does not imply causation. Patients surviving longer might simply be receiving higher cumulative albumin doses as a result. If so, it could be expected that longer survival would be associated with a more extended duration of treatment. However, that was not the case (Table 4). Additionally, it could be expected that longer survival would be accompanied by larger cumulative doses of concurrent vasoconstrictor. That also could not be detected (Table 4). Thus, it appears unlikely that improved survival could have caused larger cumulative albumin doses to be administered.

The limitations of the studies assembled in this meta-analysis arguably preclude evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice. Nonetheless, this meta-analysis does furnish the best current evidence on an issue of unequivocal clinical importance: whether patient survival might be improved by albumin dose optimization. It is recognized that meta-analyses can play an important role in setting a clinical research agenda. This meta-analysis suggests the need for future albumin dose-ranging studies. Furthermore, the meta-analysis provides specific guidance in the design of such studies, for instance, by identifying the range of cumulative albumin doses over which effects on survival may vary. In addition, the meta-analysis quantifies the magnitude of likely treatment effects associated with varying albumin doses and would therefore be of value in sample size computations for future studies.

The finding of a significant increase in short-term survival among type 1 HRS patients with increasing cumulative albumin dose is in accord with other studies of cirrhotic patients showing survival benefits associated with albumin administration. The first such demonstrated survival increase after albumin infusion was in patients with cirrhosis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in 1999. A recent meta-analysis of randomized trials in patients with SBP confirmed that mortality was decreased by 66% among the patients who received albumin. In a meta-analysis of randomized trials among cirrhotic patients undergoing large volume paracentesis, mortality was reduced by 36% in those who received albumin compared to those who received alternative treatments to improve circulatory function. Finally, in a recent randomized trial of patients with cirrhosis and episodic hepatic encephalopathy, survival at 90 days was 69% in those who received albumin compared with 40% of those who received saline. In summary, survival benefits of albumin have now been documented in type 1 HRS, SBP, large volume paracentesis, and hepatic encephalopathy. These results point to the versatility of albumin as first-line therapy for a range of serious complications in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.

### Prompt reduction in intra-abdominal pressure following large-volume mechanical fluid removal improves renal insufficiency in refractory decompensated heart failure [^d01490db]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Our group recently reported that elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP, defined as ≥ 8 mm Hg) can be associated with renal dysfunction in patients with advanced decompensated heart failure (ADHF). We hypothesize that in the setting of persistently elevated IAP and progressive renal insufficiency refractory to intensive medical therapy, mechanical fluid removal can be associated with improvements in IAP and renal function.

Methods and Results

The renal and hemodynamic profiles of 9 consecutive, volume-overloaded subjects with ADHF and elevated IAP, refractory to intensive medical therapy, were prospectively collected. All subjects experienced progressive elevation of serum creatinine and IAP in response to intravenous loop diuretics. Within 12 hours after mechanical fluid removal via paracentesis (n = 5, mean volume removed 3187 ± 1772 mL) or ultrafiltration (n = 4, mean volume removed 1800 ± 690 mL), there was a significant reduction in IAP (from 13 ± 4 mm Hg to 7 ± 2 mm Hg, P = 0.001), with corresponding improvement in renal function (serum creatinine from 3.4 ± 1.4 mg/dL to 2.4 ± 1.1 mg/dL, P = 0.01) without significantly altering any hemodynamic measurement.

Conclusion

In volume-overloaded patients admitted with ADHF refractory to intensive medical therapy, we observed a reduction of otherwise persistently elevated IAP with corresponding improvement in renal function after mechanical fluid removal.

### Effects of plasma expansion with albumin and paracentesis on haemodynamics and kidney function in critically ill cirrhotic patients with tense ascites and hepatorenal syndrome: a prospective uncontrolled trial [^b3617a1c]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Cardiac index in cirrhotic patients with hepato-renal syndrome may be fluid-responsive despite normal central venous pressure and global end-diastolic volume.

- Intra-abdominal hypertension, caused by ascites, can be reduced by paracentesis, resulting in a net increase in renal perfusion pressure.

- After paracentesis, fluid substitution can be titrated to keep global end-diastolic volume constant, and creatinine clearance and fractional excretion of sodium may increase.

- In cirrhotic intensive care patients with intra-abdominal hypertension caused by ascites resulting from fluid therapy, paracentesis is a safe procedure.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^e75a2a93]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for select patient populations have been published in some jurisdictions, particularly in patients with cirrhosis. The British Society for Gastroenterology published guidelines on the management of patients with cirrhosis and ascites. They recommend albumin for patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis or with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The French Society of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine and the French Association for the Study of the Liver jointly released guidelines for the management of liver failure in critical care. They recommend the use of albumin for hepatorenal syndrome (with terlipressin), large-volume paracentesis (> 5 L), and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The American Association for the Study of Liver Disease guidelines from 2021recommend the use of albumin for large-volume paracentesis, severe muscle cramps, severe hyponatremia (sodium < 120 mEq/L), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and hepatorenal syndrome. The Italian Association for the Study of Liver Disease and the Italian Society for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology guidelines update from 2020 include the use of albumin for ascites requiring moderate doses of diuretics as an outpatient treatment. This was an update from their 2016 guidelines that also recommended the use of albumin in patients requiring large-volume paracentesis, with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, or with hepatorenal syndrome. Similarly, the European Association for the Study of the Liver 2018 guidelines detailing the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis recommended albumin for patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis, with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, with acute kidney injury without known cause, or with hepatorenal syndrome. The ICTMG guidelines are concordant with these guidelines for recommending albumin for large-volume paracentesis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, but report insufficient evidence to support its use in other settings. The use of albumin for hepatorenal syndrome, in conjunction with terlipressin, was recommended commonly in prior guidelines, likely based on both expert opinion and the fact that randomized trials used albumin in both treatment arms (albumin vs albumin plus terlipressin). We elected to refrain from making a recommendation without clinical trial evidence to support its use and highlight that this indication needs further study.

### Management of ascites: expert panel narrative review [^fe731bc3]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ascites can develop in the setting of a variety of pathologies. The approach to treatment depends on accurate determination of the underlying cause, for which fluid analysis plays a central role. In particular, the serum-ascites-albumin gradient serves as a primary diagnostic test for differentiating among causes, with certain additional fluid tests performed based on clinical suspicion. Treatment options range from nonspecific fluid removal, including large-volume paracentesis and tunneled peritoneal catheters, to targeted therapies (e.g., diuretics, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, and lymphangiography). Societal guidelines exist for the approach to cirrhotic ascites, but the management of other less common causes remains less well defined. The goal of this AJR Expert Panel Narrative Review is to provide guidance for the diagnosis and management of ascites, based on available evidence and the authors' clinical experience.

### Management of hepatorenal syndrome in patients with cirrhosis [^38e2e25f]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

Patients with liver cirrhosis develop progressive circulatory dysfunction, which induces activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), activation of the sympathetic nervous system and increased activity of antidiuretic hormone. Such activation results in renal fluid retention, ascites and dilutional hyponatremia. In patients with advanced cirrhosis, these processes culminate in renal vasoconstriction and type 2 hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), which is characterized by slowly progressive renal failure and refractory ascites. Type 1 HRS is characterized by acute renal failure and rapid deterioration in the function of other organs in the setting of a precipitating event. Prognosis for both types of HRS is notably poor and orthotopic liver transplantation is the only definitive treatment; however, various therapies that restore renal function can provide a bridge to transplantation. Vasoconstrictors plus albumin improve renal function in 40–60% of patients with type 1 HRS. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement is also effective in type 1 HRS, but its applicability is low (as it is not suitable for all patients), and it increases the risk of encephalopathy. Albumin dialysis is a potentially effective treatment for type 1 HRS still under investigation. Patients with type 2 HRS are treated with repeated large-volume paracentesis or TIPS.

### Are crystalloid-based fluid expansion strategies still relevant in the first hours of trauma induced hemorrhagic shock? [^71364a50]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Traumatic brain injury

Current doctrine focuses on the reduction of secondary tissue injury in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Restoration of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) in circulatory shock is critical to ensure oxygen delivery to the brain. Guidelines advocate in favor of an initial systolic blood pressure target over 110 mmHg in patients with severe TBI and advise against permissive hypotension strategies. Clinicians must therefore prioritize between two conflicting clinical strategies of either neuroprotection or hemorrhage limitation. Furthermore, in traumatology shock can arise from multiple causes that do not necessarily involve severe hemorrhage (tension pneumothorax, neurogenic hypotension, pericardial effusion). Such differential diagnoses highly complexify the clinician's dilemma if TBI is suspected.

The evidence underlying current guidelines in favor of increased blood pressure targets consists unfortunately of observational studies suggesting increased mortality rates among patients with prehospital or admission hypotension with TBI. Fuller et al. in 2013, estimated odds of death to be doubled for an admission SBP below 100 mmHg and tripled below 90 mmHg among a population of patients with AIS head scores above 2. Observational studies indicate a U-shaped relationship between prehospital blood pressure and in hospital mortality in TBI suggesting that hypertension could be also detrimental to survival. Recent observational data suggests that elderly patients could benefit from higher blood pressure levels highlighting the existence of potential high-risk subgroups. The body of evidence supporting the existence of a unique lower threshold defining critical hypotension is limited. Spaite et al. for instance observed a linear association between SBP and mortality. In their cohort, two patients with a SBP difference of 10 mmHg differed in their odds of death by 18.8%.

Despite the low level of evidence, hypotension appears to be a major secondary insult among patients with TBI that must be avoided at all costs. However, safe blood pressure levels as well as the definition of specific subgroups of patients at higher risk remain unclear and must be addressed by future RCTs.

Treatment of hypotension among patients with TBI can be achieved through fluid expansion strategies. Hypotonic crystalloids must be avoided as they maximize vasogenic oedema and have been shown to increase mortality. Hypertonic solutions have failed to show increased survival rates and improvements in neurologic outcomes after severe TBI. Current guidelines therefore recommend the use of 0,9% sodium chloride as it is easily accessible and more cost effective. The safety and efficacy of vasopressor use in combination to fluid expansion strategies in TBI remains uncertain and must be assessed by future RCTs.

### Treatment and management of ascites and hepatorenal syndrome: an update [^ff83a769]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Ascites and renal dysfunction are frequent complications experienced by patients with cirrhosis of the liver. Ascites is the pathologic accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity, and is one of the cardinal signs of portal hypertension. The diagnostic evaluation of ascites involves assessment of its granulocyte count and protein concentration to exclude complications such as infection or malignoma and to allow risk stratification for the development of spontaneous peritonitis. Although sodium restriction and diuretics remain the cornerstone of the management of ascites, many patients require additional therapy when they become refractory to this treatment. In this situation, the treatment of choice is repeated large-volume paracentesis. Alteration in splanchnic hemodynamics is one of the most important changes underlying the development of ascites. Further splanchnic dilation leads to changes in systemic hemodynamics, activating vasopressor agents and leading to decreased renal perfusion. Small alterations in renal function influence the prognosis, which depends on the cause of renal failure. Prerenal failure is evident in about 70% of patients, whereas in about 30% of patients the cause is hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), which is associated with a worse prognosis. Therefore, effective therapy is of great clinical importance. Recent data indicate that use of the new definition of acute kidney injury facilitates the identification and treatment of patients with renal insufficiency more rapidly than use of the current criteria for HRS. In this review article, we evaluate approaches to the management of patients with ascites and HRS.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^bde7f294]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Abdominal distension attributable to refractory ascites — palliative options and outcomes include the following: Large volume paracentesis (LVP) requires multiple visits to the hospital and can be burdensome, and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an option but many patients with refractory ascites are not candidates because of encephalopathy, cardiac contraindications, or high MELD scores. Indwelling peritoneal drains or catheters have been evaluated for palliation, and a systematic review including 176 patients reported patients' MELD scores ranged from 10 to 22, technical success was 100% with noninfectious complications generally low (< 12%), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis occurred in 0%–42% with an overall combined rate of 17%, and other complications included cellulitis at the catheter insertion site (6%), transient hyponatremia (11%), and increased serum creatinine (8%). A 12-week, small feasibility, unblinded randomized controlled trial compared LVP to long-term abdominal drains in 36 transplant-ineligible patients with refractory ascites, noted no drain-related serious adverse events or drain removals attributable to complications, found patients in the LVP group had more than double the ascites-related hospital time than the drain group, observed self-limiting cellulitis/leakage 41% versus 11% and peritonitis 6% versus 11%, and reported overall attrition 42% with deaths 7 of 16 and 5 of 18; at study end, all surviving drain participants elected to retain the drains.

### Albumin: pathophysiologic basis of its role in the treatment of cirrhosis and its complications [^5203db75]. Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Since the introduction of human serum albumin as a plasma expander in the 1940s, considerable research has allowed a better understanding of its biochemical properties and potential clinical benefits. Albumin has a complex structure, which is responsible for a variety of biological functions. In disease, the albumin molecule is susceptible to modifications that may alter its biological activity. During the last decades, different methods to measure albumin function have been developed. Recent studies have shown that not only albumin concentration but also albumin function is reduced in liver failure. This observation led to the concept of effective albumin concentration, which represents the fact that plasma albumin concentration does not reflect its function. Indeed, in liver disease albumin function is several times less than its concentration. In patients with cirrhosis, albumin infusion reduces mortality in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and improves outcome following large volume paracentesis. In combination with vasoconstrictors, albumin is useful in the management of patients with hepatorenal syndrome. Its role is being investigated in a large number of indications, which rely on its volume and nonvolume expansion functions such as stroke, severe sepsis, Alzheimer's disease, malaria, burns, and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. This review explores the above concepts, reviews the available evidence for the use of albumin in liver diseases, defines therapeutic limitations, and explores the challenges that should be addressed in future research.

### Pharmacological management of fluid overload [^0410addd]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Standard treatment practice for the hypotensive patient with poor tissue perfusion is rapid volume resuscitation; in some scenarios, such as septic shock, this is performed with targeted goal-directed endpoints within 6 h of presentation. As a result, patients often develop significant positive fluid accumulation, which has been associated with poor outcomes above certain thresholds.

Methods

The aim of the current paper is to provide guidance for active pharmacological fluid management in the patient with, or at risk for, clinically significant positive fluid balance from either resuscitation for hypovolaemic shock or acute decompensated heart failure.

Results

We develop rationale for pharmacological fluid management targets (prevention of worsening fluid accumulation, achievement of slow vs rapid net negative fluid balance) in the context of phases of critical illness provided in the earlier Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative 12 papers.

### Abdominal paracentesis… [^5c163208]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

The normal abdominal cavity has a small amount of fluid. Cirrhosis with associated portal hypertension. is the most common cause of ascites. Other causes of ascites include cancer, heart failure, kidney failure, tuberculosis, and pancreatic disease. An abdominal paracentesis involves the surgical puncture of the abdominal cavity with a needle and placement of a catheter line for the removal of excess fluid. The procedure can be diagnostic in helping identify the cause of ascites or may be used as a therapeutic measure if a large volume of fluid can be removed to lessen discomfort and improve breathing. The March 12. 2008, issue of JAMA includes an article about paracentesis techniques. It identifies ways to decrease the risk of complications and to improve diagnostic accuracy.

Patients with new-onset ascites Patients with chronic ascites and at least one of the following symptoms: Fever Abdominal pain Increasing ascites volume — increasing abdominal girth. Unexplained encephalopathy Declining liver function Kidney failure With current techniques, diagnostic paracentesis is considered a safe procedure. Some coagulopathies may make the procedure too risky to perform. Pregnancy, organomegaly, severe bowel or bladder distention, and previous abdominal-pelvic surgery may increase the risk of the procedure. In those situations, an ultrasound-guided paracentesis should be considered. Procedural complications are rare but can include.

Persistent leakage of ascitic fluid Circulatory problems, such as lowered blood pressure Localized infection at the puncture site Abdominal wall blood clots or bruises Bleeding Injury to organs in the abdomen Tests of the removed fluid help to establish the cause of the ascites and to rule out infection. These tests include counts of the numbers and types of cells in the fluid. Testing for albumin should be done in cases of new ascites. Additional tests may be done depending on the patient's history and physical examination.

### Albumin infusion in patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^060499d6]. Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Albumin infusion reduces the incidence of postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction among patients with cirrhosis and tense ascites, as compared with no treatment. Treatment alternatives to albumin, such as artificial colloids and vasoconstrictors, have been widely investigated. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine whether morbidity and mortality differ between patients receiving albumin versus alternative treatments. The meta-analysis included randomized trials evaluating albumin infusion in patients with tense ascites. Primary endpoints were postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction, hyponatremia, and mortality. Eligible trials were sought by multiple methods, including computer searches of bibliographic and abstract databases and the Cochrane Library. Results were quantitatively combined under a fixed-effects model. Seventeen trials with 1,225 total patients were included. There was no evidence of heterogeneity or publication bias. Compared with alternative treatments, albumin reduced the incidence of postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction (odds ratio [OR], 0.39; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.27–0.55). Significant reductions in that complication by albumin were also shown in subgroup analyses versus each of the other volume expanders tested (e.g., dextran, gelatin, hydroxyethyl starch, and hypertonic saline). The occurrence of hyponatremia was also decreased by albumin, compared with alternative treatments (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.39–0.87). In addition, mortality was lower in patients receiving albumin than alternative treatments (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.41–0.98).

Conclusions

This meta-analysis provides evidence that albumin reduces morbidity and mortality among patients with tense ascites undergoing large-volume paracentesis, as compared with alternative treatments investigated thus far.

### Albumin human — albumin — human [^0bb721a9]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

1.1 Hypovolemia

ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% is indicated in the emergency treatment of hypovolemia with or without shock. Its effectiveness in reversing hypovolemia depends largely upon its ability to draw interstitial fluid into the circulation. It is most effective in patients who are well hydrated. When blood volume deficit is the result of hemorrhage, compatible red blood cells or whole blood should be administered as quickly as possible. [1, 2]

When hypovolemia is long standing and hypoalbuminemia exists accompanied by adequate hydration or edema, 20% - 25% albumin solutions should be used. [1]

1.2 Hypoalbuminemia

For subjects with hypoalbuminemia who are critically ill and/or are bleeding actively, ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% infusions may be indicated. [3] When albumin deficit is the result of excessive protein loss, the effect of administration of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% will be temporary unless the underlying disorder is reversed.

1.3 Prevention of Central Volume Depletion after Paracentesis due to Cirrhotic Ascites (Treatment Adjunct)

ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be used to maintain cardiovascular function following the removal of large volumes of ascitic fluid after paracentesis due to cirrhotic ascites. [2]

1.4 Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)

ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be used as a plasma expander in fluid management relating to severe forms of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). [7, 8]

1.5 Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) (Treatment Adjunct)

ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% infusions may be indicated in conjunction with diuretics to correct the fluid volume overload associated with ARDS. [5]

1.6 Acute Nephrosis (Treatment Adjunct)

ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be used to treat edema in patients with acute nephrosis who are refractory to cyclophosphamide and corticosteroid therapy. [1]

1.7 Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn (HDN)

ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% is indicated in the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia. It may be used prior to or during an exchange procedure in an attempt to bind free bilirubin and to enhance its removal. [6]

### Paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction with modest-volume paracentesis is partly ameliorated by albumin infusion in acute-on-chronic liver failure [^06fc841f]. Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (PICD) is a serious complication of large-volume (> 5 L) paracentesis in cirrhosis and is reduced with albumin infusion. There is a lack of data on PICD in acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). Because ACLF patients have greater hemodynamic derangements than patients with decompensated cirrhosis, we investigated whether PICD could develop with modest-volume paracentesis (MVP) and the role of albumin infusion.

Approach and Results

A total of 80 ACLF patients undergoing < 5 L paracentesis were randomized to receive albumin (8 g/dL of ascitic fluid; n = 40) or no albumin (n = 40) and serially followed to detect PICD. Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups, including volume of ascitic tap (4.16 ± 0.23 versus 4.14 ± 0.27 L; P = 0.72) and plasma renin activity (PRA; 20.5 ± 7.03 versus 23.2 ± 8.24 ng/mL/hour; P = 0.12). PICD was more frequent in the no-albumin group than the albumin group (70% versus 30%; P = 0.001), with higher incidence of hepatic encephalopathy (50% versus 27.5%; P = 0.04), hyponatremia (67.5% versus 22.5%; P < 0.001), acute kidney injury (62.5% versus 30%; P = 0.001), and in-house mortality (62.5% versus 27.5%; P = 0.003). PRA of 25.15 ng/mL at day 3 had sensitivity and specificity of 71% and 68%, respectively, for development of PICD at day 6. Albumin infusion decreased the incidence of PICD at day 6 (odds ratio, 0.068; 95% confidence interval, 0.011–0.43; P = 0.005).

Conclusions

PICD is common and develops even with MVP in ACLF patients. Albumin infusion decreases the incidence of PICD and mortality in patients with ACLF. Clinical trial identifier: NCT02467348.

### The clinical management of abdominal ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: a review of current guidelines and recommendations [^30035c69]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Several pathogenic processes have been implicated in the development of abdominal ascites. Portal hypertension, most usually in the context of liver cirrhosis, can explain about 75% of the cases, whereas infective, inflammatory and infiltrative aetiologies can account for the rest. In this article, we discuss the consensus best practice as published by three professional bodies for the management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The aim of this study was to compare available clinical guidelines and identify areas of agreement and conflict. We carried out a review of the guidance documentation published by three expert bodies including the British Society of Gastroenterology, the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), as well as a wider literature search for ascites, SBP and HRS. Abdominal ultrasonography, diagnostic paracentesis and ascitic fluid cultures are recommended by all three guidelines, especially when there is strong clinical suspicion for infection. EASL and AASLD advocate the use of ascitic amylase and mycobacterial cultures/PCR when there is strong suspicion for tuberculosis and pancreatitis, respectively. Ascitic cytology can be useful when cancer is suspected and has a good diagnostic yield if performed correctly. EASL supports the use of urinary electrolytes for all patients; however, the British Society of Gastroenterology and AASLD only recommend their use for therapy monitoring. All three societies recommend cefotaxime as the antibiotic of choice for SBP and large-volume paracentesis for the management of ascites greater than 5l in volume. For HRS, cautious diuresis, volume expansion with albumin and the use of vasoactive drugs are recommended. There appears to be good concordance between recommendations by the European, American and British guidelines for the management of ascites and the possible complications arising from it.

### Effects of plasma expansion with albumin and paracentesis on haemodynamics and kidney function in critically ill cirrhotic patients with tense ascites and hepatorenal syndrome: a prospective uncontrolled trial [^158bd2e3]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

The elevation of CC seen already during the first 12 hours after paracentesis was maintained over 48 hours while central blood volume, as indicated by GEDVI, was kept constant. The improved serum creatinine values seen at 7 and 12 days after the last paracentesis also indicate that renal function remained above baseline in most of the patients. As has previously been shown, post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction is most pronounced after 6 days. Its detrimental effect on kidney function can be prevented by plasma expansion with albumin. Our results suggest that elevated IAP may be a contributing factor in the development of renal failure in cirrhotic patients with tense ascites and that paracentesis may have a role in the treatment of HRS as long as central blood volume is maintained. The cause of the falling SVRI seen after paracentesis is controversial. On the basis of our findings we propose that increasing splanchnic and renal blood flow and decreased activation of endogenous vasopressor systems are important effects of paracentesis and that the decreased vascular tone may reflect not a deterioration of circulatory dysfunction but less demand for vasoconstrictor activation in the face of improving abdominal and renal perfusion pressures. The concomitant increase in splanchnic blood volume would further underline the importance of maintaining adequate preload, and post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction could be regarded mainly as representing relative hypovolaemia caused by fluid losses into the intra-peritoneal compartment.

### Improving appropriate use of intravenous albumin: results of a single-centre audit and multifaceted intervention [^0762bd39]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Intravenous albumin is used in many clinical scenarios, either as an iso-oncotic (4–5%, 250–500 mL) or as a hyper-oncotic (20–25%, 100 mL) formulation. The iso-oncotic preparation is employed for volume expansion, and the hyper-oncotic formulation is used for restoration of oncotic pressureor mobilisation of fluid from extravascular spaces. Although used broadly in the hospitalised patient, albumin has only been shown in trials to have potential benefits in patients with complications of cirrhosis. Albumin reduces the incidence of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction in patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis, although the impact on patient-important outcomes is less clear. Albumin appears to also reduce mortality and renal failure in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Albumin is also commonly employed in hepatorenal syndrome, although no randomised trials of albumin compared with no albumin have been conducted.

Outside of patients with complications of cirrhosis, large randomised trials have compared intravenous albumin with crystalloids in critical care patients, adult and paediatric patients with sepsis and patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Collectively, these trials find patient-important outcomes with albumin no better than crystalloid but care markedly more expensive. More recent evidence also suggests that adverse consequences of albumin have been underappreciated, such as volume overload, anaphylaxis, more red cell transfusions and peripheral gangrene. These trials have called into question the common use of albumin in patients without cirrhosis.

Published audits of albumin usage from different countries have found that albumin is regularly prescribed for non-evidence-based indications and is generally over-prescribed. Albumin utilisation doubled in Ontario, Canada, between 2000 and 2017, with only 22% of orders being transfused to patients with cirrhosis. To mitigate unnecessary albumin usage and wastage, we undertook a single-centre, multifaceted quality improvement project to align albumin prescribing with published evidence.

### Improvement in quality of life and decrease in large-volume paracentesis requirements with the automated low-flow ascites pump [^e927a017]. Liver Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

The most common electrolyte abnormality (10 of 11 events) was hyponatremia (serum sodium of < 130 mmol/L). Two episodes of hyponatremia were related to pump rates being set too high and recovered after reducing the pump rates. The remaining 8 episodes of hyponatremia were chronologically related to concomitant diuretic use, which was not prohibited during the study. These settled after discontinuing diuretics. Renal function for the entire cohort remained relatively stable despite not mandating albumin infusions (serum creatinine at baseline: 93 ± 23 versus 107 ± 34 µmol/L at 12 months). A total of 11 reports of AKI in 9 patients occurred beyond 7 days after implantation: 2 related episodes were possibly due to high pump rates, and 9 unrelated episodes were due to concurrent diuretic use or infection. AKI episodes increased the mean baseline serum creatinine for these episodes from 105 ± 28 µmol/L to a mean peak value of 209 ± 56 µmol/L. There were 5 of these episodes that completely resolved; 3 partially improved; and 3 did not improve and resulted in death. Because albumin infusion was not mandated by the protocol, there was no requirement to record the amount of albumin used in these patients and for what indication. However, for the busiest site that enrolled 11 patients, the median amount of albumin given for all indications over the 12‐month study period was 525 g (range, 25‐4925 g; median study period, 12 months; range 3‐12 months). Supporting Table 1 shows the changes in serum albumin over the 12‐month period. Essentially, the serum albumin oscillated around the baseline value of 34.4 ± 6.4 g/L.

Management of HRS-AKI — prevention focuses on modifiable triggers and cautious albumin use, noting uncertain long-term benefit. Prevention measures include "avoidance of alcohol use, monitoring of serum creatinine and electrolytes when patients are on diuretics, albumin infusion with therapeutic paracentesis, administering antibiotics with episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding, antibiotic prophylaxis against spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and avoiding use of nonselective beta-blockers and nephrotoxic medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs." It is stated that "It is unclear whether long-term albumin infusion prevents HRS. Long-term albumin administration reduced the likelihood of developing HRS and improved 18-month survival in one study, but the results were not replicated in another study." Patients "may derive most benefit when the serum albumin is kept above 4 g/ dL," and clinicians should recognize that "Albumin infusion may be associated with volume overload and life-threatening pulmonary edema."

### Daily low-volume paracentesis and clinical complications in patients with refractory ascites [^8394a36c]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Besides the increased incidence of clinical end points in patients with drainage of 1.5 L/d or more, we observed a significant decrease of serum sodium while leucocyte count and C-reactive protein increased in patients with taps of 1.5 L/d or more after 28 days, similar to patients undergoing LVP without albumin infusion. Interestingly, this was not the case in patients with daily drainage of 1.5 L/d or less. In the setting of LVP without albumin substitution, postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction (PPCD) occurs frequently and is most likely the result of effective blood volume reduction.PPCD is associated with AKI, hyponatremia, and decreased survival. Repeated low-volume paracentesis of 1.5 L/d or more might have led to a PPCD-like state over time and could explain the clinical observations in our cohort. Data about the potential associations of repeated low-volume drainage regarding an altered clinical course and the occurrence of PPCD are scarce, and it has been suggested that removal of less than 5 L ascites per drain does rarely lead to PPCD, at least in the setting of a single paracentesis. Thus, albumin infusion in these patients remains a matter of debate. However, PPCD has already been reported in patients with Alfapump, and our data indicate that complications occur with increasing drainage volumes, even in the setting of low-volume paracentesis. In our cohort, none of the patients received regular albumin infusion after drainage and albumin was only administered for other indications like SBP, AKI, or hyponatremia. Strikingly, albumin infusion can effectively prevent PPCD and is recommended after paracentesis of more than 5 L. Thus, it is tempting to estimate that albumin infusion could decrease complications in individuals with daily drains of 1.5 L/d or more. Treatment could be adapted in those who are in need of taps of 1.5 L/d or more. One could only drain less than 1.5 L/d and perform LVP every few weeks (via the device) with albumin infusion in an outpatient unit. However, this would contradict the idea of home-based therapy. Another potential option could be drainage of 1.5 L/d or more and infusion of albumin with the help of a dedicated care service, in the same manner as palliative patients receive infusions in a home-based care. Future studies might therefore investigate the association of albumin infusions, especially in those with higher daily drainage volumes.

### Plasma expanders for people with cirrhosis and large ascites treated with abdominal paracentesis [^ab86969f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Plasma volume expanders are used in connection to paracentesis in people with cirrhosis to prevent reduction of effective plasma volume, which may trigger deleterious effect on haemodynamic balance, and increase morbidity and mortality. Albumin is considered the standard product against which no plasma expansion or other plasma expanders, e.g. other colloids (polygeline, dextrans, hydroxyethyl starch solutions, fresh frozen plasma), intravenous infusion of ascitic fluid, crystalloids, or mannitol have been compared. However, the benefits and harms of these plasma expanders are not fully clear.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of any plasma volume expanders such as albumin, other colloids (polygeline, dextrans, hydroxyethyl starch solutions, fresh frozen plasma), intravenous infusion of ascitic fluid, crystalloids, or mannitol versus no plasma volume expander or versus another plasma volume expander for paracentesis in people with cirrhosis and large ascites.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang, Science Citation Index Expanded, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index until January 2019. Furthermore, we searched FDA, EMA, WHO (last search January 2019), www.clinicaltrials.gov/, and www.controlled-trials.com/ for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials, no matter their design or year of publication, publication status, and language, assessing the use of any type of plasma expander versus placebo, no intervention, or a different plasma expander in connection with paracentesis for ascites in people with cirrhosis. We considered quasi-randomised, retrieved with the searches for randomised clinical trials only, for reports on harms.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) using the fixed-effect model and the random-effects model meta-analyses, based on the intention-to-treat principle, whenever possible. If the fixed-effect and random-effects models showed different results, then we made our conclusions based on the analysis with the highest P value (the more conservative result). We assessed risks of bias of the individual trials using predefined bias risk domains. We assessed the certainty of the evidence at an outcome level, using GRADE, and constructed 'Summary of Findings' tables for seven of our review outcomes.

Main Results

We identified 27 randomised clinical trials for inclusion in this review (24 published as full-text articles and 3 as abstracts). Five of the trials, with 271 participants, assessed plasma expanders (albumin in four trials and ascitic fluid in one trial) versus no plasma expander. The remaining 22 trials, with 1321 participants, assessed one type of plasma expander, i.e. dextran, hydroxyethyl starch, polygeline, intravenous infusion of ascitic fluid, crystalloids, or mannitol versus another type of plasma expander, i.e. albumin in 20 of these trials and polygeline in one trial. Twenty-five trials provided data for quantitative meta-analysis. According to the Child-Pugh classification, most participants were at an intermediate to advanced stage of liver disease in the absence of hepatocellular carcinoma, recent gastrointestinal bleeding, infections, and hepatic encephalopathy. All trials were assessed as at overall high risk of bias. Ten trials seemed not to have been funded by industry; twelve trials were considered unclear about funding; and five trials were considered funded by industry or a for-profit institution. We found no evidence of a difference in effect between plasma expansion versus no plasma expansion on mortality (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.06 to 4.83; 248 participants; 4 trials; very low certainty); renal impairment (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.02 to 5.88; 181 participants; 4 trials; very low certainty); other liver-related complications (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.79 to 3.27; 248 participants; 4 trials; very low certainty); and non-serious adverse events (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.32 to 3.40; 158 participants; 3 trials; very low certainty). Two of the trials stated that no serious adverse events occurred while the remaining trials did not report on this outcome. No trial reported data on health-related quality of life. We found no evidence of a difference in effect between experimental plasma expanders versus albumin on mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.30; 1014 participants; 14 trials; very low certainty); serious adverse events (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.10 to 8.30; 118 participants; 2 trials; very low certainty); renal impairment (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.91; 1107 participants; 17 trials; very low certainty); other liver-related complications (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.48; 1083 participants; 16 trials; very low certainty); and non-serious adverse events (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.85; 977 participants; 14 trials; very low certainty). We found no data on heath-related quality of life and refractory ascites.

Authors' Conclusions

Our systematic review and meta-analysis did not find any benefits or harms of plasma expanders versus no plasma expander or of one plasma expander such as polygeline, dextrans, hydroxyethyl starch, intravenous infusion of ascitic fluid, crystalloids, or mannitol versus albumin on primary or secondary outcomes. The data originated from few, small, mostly short-term trials at high risks of systematic errors (bias) and high risks of random errors (play of chance). GRADE assessments concluded that the evidence was of very low certainty. Therefore, we can neither demonstrate or discard any benefit of plasma expansion versus no plasma expansion, and differences between one plasma expander versus another plasma expander. Larger trials at low risks of bias are needed to assess the role of plasma expanders in connection with paracentesis. Such trials should be conducted according to the SPIRIT guidelines and reported according to the CONSORT guidelines.

### Introduction to the revised American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases position paper on acute liver failure 2011 [^55e38f80]. Hepatology (2012). Medium credibility.

Acute liver failure hemodynamic management — To optimize neurological recovery after ALF, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) must be raised to avoid cerebral underperfusion and anoxia; in hypotensive patients, intravascular volume should be replaced first with normal saline and thereafter norepinephrine should be used to increase MAP to 60–80 mm Hg; vasopressin or terlipressin is often added but was reported to increase intracranial pressure (ICP) in ALF, although more recent data suggest vasopressin and analogous drugs increase cerebral perfusion without increasing ICP and may be used safely as an adjunct to norepinephrine.
