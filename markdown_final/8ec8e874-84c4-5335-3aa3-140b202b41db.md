Answer Choices:
A. Using emotionally charged language to create an impression about the subject of a claim, without making an argument that the language fits the subject.
B. Treating something that exists in the mind as if it was a real object.
C. Confusing figurative language with literal language.
D. A form of loaded language that uses an emotionally charged restatement of the claim in place of support for the claim.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option best describes the fallacy of figure of speech. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "figure of speech" means in logic and rhetoric. Then, I should verify which option maps most directly to mistaking figurative for literal language. Next, I will consider whether the other options reflect different fallacies or rhetorical devices rather than the figure-of-speech error. Finally, I will confirm the best fit and briefly justify it with a concrete example to ensure clarity.

> Let me first confirm the core concept. A figure of speech is figurative language — metaphor, simile, hyperbole, idiom, etc. — used for rhetorical effect rather than literal assertion. The fallacy occurs when someone interprets that figurative expression literally or argues as if it were literal, thereby creating a semantic confusion that undermines the argument's validity.

> Now, I should examine Option C: "Confusing figurative language with literal language". Wait, let me verify that this aligns with the classic example. When someone says "time flies" and another responds by asking how fast it flies and whether it needs a pilot's license, that's precisely the error of taking figurative language literally, which is the textbook figure-of-speech fallacy. So Option C matches the definition directly.

> Next, I should review Option A: "Using emotionally charged language to create an impression… without making an argument". Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — this sounds more like an appeal to emotion or loaded language rather than a figure-of-speech confusion. The figure-of-speech fallacy is about misinterpreting figurative expressions as literal, not about using emotionally charged terms to persuade without argument, so A is a different rhetorical issue.

> I will now examine Option B: "Treating something that exists in the mind as if it was a real object". Hmm, wait a minute, this resembles a reification fallacy or the fallacy of hypostatization, where abstract concepts are treated as concrete entities. That's not the same as confusing figurative and literal language, so B does not fit the figure-of-speech fallacy.

> Let me consider Option D: "A form of loaded language that uses an emotionally charged restatement of the claim in place of support". I should double-check — this again describes loaded language or circular/emotive restatement, not the misinterpretation of figurative expressions as literal. So D is also a different fallacy or rhetorical strategy, not the figure-of-speech error.

> Putting this together, the best answer is C, because it captures the essence of the fallacy: mistaking figurative language for literal language, which derails reasoning by misreading the intended meaning of the expression. Options A, B, and D describe other rhetorical problems and do not match the specific confusion at the heart of the figure-of-speech fallacy.

---

The fallacy of figure of speech is best described as **confusing figurative language with literal language**. This error occurs when a metaphor, idiom, or other figurative expression is interpreted as a factual claim, leading to flawed reasoning. For example, saying "time flies" and then arguing that time literally has wings is a figure-of-speech fallacy. Options A and D describe **loaded language**, and B describes **reification**, which are different fallacies.

---

## Definition and explanation

The fallacy of figure of speech arises when figurative expressions are **misinterpreted as literal statements**, causing logical errors. Figurative language — metaphors, similes, idioms, and hyperbole — is used to convey meaning beyond the literal words; when taken literally, it can distort the intended message and lead to invalid conclusions [^notfound].

---

## Examples of the fallacy

Several examples illustrate this fallacy:

- **Metaphorical language**: Saying "time flies" and then arguing that time literally has wings.
- **Idiomatic expressions**: Interpreting "break a leg" as a literal instruction to injure oneself rather than a wish for good luck.
- **Hyperbolic statements**: Taking "I'm so hungry I could eat a horse" as a literal claim about eating an entire horse.

In each case, the figurative expression is **mistaken for a literal claim**, leading to absurd or incorrect conclusions.

---

## Distinction from other fallacies

The fallacy of figure of speech is distinct from other logical fallacies:

- **Loaded language (options A and D)**: Using emotionally charged words to sway opinion without providing evidence is a different fallacy, not related to figurative language.
- **Reification (option B)**: Treating abstract concepts as concrete objects is a separate fallacy, not involving figurative language.

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **C. Confusing figurative language with literal language**. This fallacy occurs when figurative expressions are misinterpreted as literal statements, leading to flawed reasoning. Options A and D describe loaded language, and B describes reification, which are different fallacies.

a Decision level predictions. The probability of choosing right (P("R")) given each rightward prior, simulated with three levels of prior weighting: optimal (w choice = 1), overweighting (w choice = 0.5), and underweighting (w choice = 2). The model predicts that weaker prior weighting in the decision leads to a weaker relationship between the rightward prior strength and the P("R"). b Decision level results. Simulations from the fit model shown against the data, with optimal weighting as a reference. This reveals a weaker slope of the P("R") across rightward prior strengths compared to optimal, indicating underweighting of priors. c Confidence level predictions. Confidence given each level of rightward prior, simulated with three levels of prior weighting relative to decision level underweighting (w choice = 2): equal (w conf = 2), stronger (w conf = 1), and weaker (w conf = 4) weighting. The model predicts that prior weighting in confidence influences the curvature of the relationship between confidence and prior strength. To highlight that curvature, confidence is shown normalized to the flat prior condition (Prior Strength = 0.5) as a baseline by taking the difference in mean confidence to that baseline. d Confidence level results. Simulations from the fit model shown against the data, with symmetrical weighting (w conf = w choice) shown as a reference. This reveals stronger concavity across rightward prior strengths compared to equal weighting, indicating stronger prior weighting in confidence than in decisions. e Posterior distribution for w choice.

### Single-photon microscopy to study biomolecular condensates [^f3704df8]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

When dealing with multiple cell conditions, interpreting the diffusion law analysis can become challenging, particularly when cells exhibit intrinsic variability during dynamic processes (see Supplementary Fig. 3). To facilitate comparisons between conditions, we introduce a metric known as confinement strength (S conf). This metric is defined as the ratio between the diffusion coefficients calculated for the smallest focal area (central pixel only) and the biggest focal area (Sum 5 × 5). A similar metric was already used to represent how strong molecules are confined in domains while diffusing. When S conf is 1, the diffusion coefficients are not dependent on the detection volumes, which is the case when molecules are freely diffusing. If S conf is bigger than 1, the molecules are moving in a dense meshwork, while when S conf is smaller than 1, the molecules are showing a confined-domain type of movement. The confinement strength allows us to parameterize the movement of the investigated molecules and compare the different cellular conditions. In the WT condition, G3BP1 restricts its mobility during oxidative stress (Fig. 3 c left). The apparent diffusion coefficients (in the x -axis, empty symbols: pre-stress, filled symbols: in SGs), i.e. the ones measured with the whole detector area (Sum 5 × 5), are smaller after the SGs are formed. In addition, after the stress, the confinement strength is lower than one, indicating a domain-confined behavior. Contrarily, FUS proteins, in the WT cell condition do not change behavior or mobility (Fig. 3 c right).

Confetti labelling simulation

To perform the Confetti labelling simulation (Extended Data Fig. 1f), a custom PERL script was written to randomly assign a Confetti label to crypts in a 10 × 100 field of unmarked crypts, using the observed Confetti fluorophore frequencies (CFP 2.7%, YFP 4.1%, and RFP 3.8%). The number of patches (contiguous crypts with the same fluorophore) was quantified for each simulation (a total of 1,000 simulations were run for each fluorophore), and the distribution of coloured crypts within particular patch sizes was calculated.

### Prior information differentially affects discrimination decisions and subjective confidence reports [^e5965064]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Finally, with this hierarchical modelling approach, with both the Flexible model and simpler models, we were able to more directly compare the relative weighting of priors and likelihoods at the decision and confidence level (Fig. 5a–c). We found that w choice was credibly different from w conf, with the difference distribution just excluding 0 in the 89% credible interval [0.03, 1.77] (Fig. 5b). This again suggests the weighting of priors relative to likelihoods to differ at the level of decisions and confidence.

a Schematic of the four compared models. Schematics of the four models we compared, with the thickness of the light blue arrows depicting the weighting of priors relative to likelihoods in the decision and the thickness of the light green arrows depicting the weighting of the priors relative to likelihoods in confidence. In the Flexible Model, relative weighting of priors and likelihoods was allowed to differ between decisions and confidence (w choice was allowed to differ from w conf). The Flat Prior Model only has arrows from the target, showing that the prior information was not used at all in decisions or confidence. In the Optimal Model, w choice and w conf both had to be optimal (equal to 1). In the Equal Model, the weighting of priors relative to likelihoods was allowed to differ from optimal but the pattern was the same between w choice and w conf. b Posterior group difference distribution of w choice − w conf. The posterior distribution for the difference in the group mean parameters w choice and w conf. The blue shaded region shows the 89% credible interval and the vertical black dashed line reflects no difference in the two parameters (w choice − w conf = 0). 0 is just excluded from the 89% credible interval, suggesting w choice and w conf to be credibly different from one another. c Expected Log Pointwise Predictive Density (ELPD) results from LOGO-CV. The predictive capacity of each model is shown as the elpd value from the LOGO-CV with 10 folds, leaving out and then predicting 2 participants per fold. This shows the Flexible Model to have the highest predictive capacity, suggesting it as the best model to explain the data. This is followed by the Optimal Model, Equal Model and then Flat Prior Model. Error bars depict SE. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Automated microscopy measurements: growth curves and HT turnover rates

CHO-K1stably expressing HTs were platted in a 6 well plate at low density (5 × 10⁴ cells) and cell confluence imaged with the 10× objective every 4 h using the phase-contrast channel of the Sartorius Incucyte live-cell imaging system (Göttingen, Germany). Exponential growth was fitted to the equation % confₜ = % confₜ₀ × 2^[t/t_d], where t_d is the time for a cell division (doubling time). To measure the turnover of HT, cells were platted at the same low density, grown overnight and then labelled with 0.25 µM TMR fluorophore (Promega) in media for 6 h. After that, media was removed, cells washed with PBS, and fresh media added to start image the red fluorescence channel every 4 h with the 10× objective. Phase-contrast and fluorescence images were analysed using the Sartorius Incucyte analysis software, version 2021 C. TMR fluorescence decay was fitted to an exponential decay using the equation [TMR Int. Intens.ₜ/confₜ] = [TMR Int. Intens.ₜ₀/confₜ₀] × e^[−k_d/t] where TMR Int. Intens. is the TMR integrated fluorescence intensity corresponding to the amount of HT labelled, conf is cell confluence, and k_d is the HT degradation rate constant. Half-lifetimes were calculated by t₁⁄₂ = [ln 2/k_d]. TMR fluorescence needs to be divided by cell confluence to account for cell content sharing between daughter cells as doubling time is significantly faster than HT turnover for most variants and conditions.

### Accessibility of the histone H3 tail in the nucleosome for binding of paired readers [^5cf1d8b5]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Analysis of K conf revealed that the H3 tail within the intact H3 Cys –NCP binds relatively tightly to the nucleosome surface at low ionic strength (50 mM NaCl) and that < 1% of tails are in the NCP-unbound state and therefore available for the interaction with readers in these conditions. The K conf values varied between 0.004 and 0.01, with the S10 and A21 sites exhibiting ~two-fold greater affinities to NCP compared to other sites tested (Fig. 2d). Interestingly, the H3S10C site is located next to the highly positively charged H3R8K9 sequence that could electrostatically contact nucleosomal DNA (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2). Increasing the salt concentration to 150 mM resulted in an ~12-fold increase in the average K conf value, corroborating primarily electrostatic nature of the interaction between H3 tails and NCP (Fig. 2e). Unlike the low salt condition measurements, there was less variation in K conf values among the six sites in the elevated salt conditions, suggesting some cooperativity along the entire length of the H3 tail in binding to the nucleosome surface (Fig. 2e).

Reducing the positive charge in the H3 tail by replacing K4, K9, K14, K18, K23, and K27 with a glutamine in the H3 Cys/6KQ -NCP led to a three-fold increase in K conf values, however, did not abolish contacts of H3 tail with NCP, pointing to a substantial contribution not only of lysine residues but also of positively charged arginine residues to the H3 tail-nucleosome core interaction (Fig. 2f and g). Importantly, K conf of ~ 0.1, measured for the intra-nucleosome interaction of H3 tail in near physiological ionic strength, implies that binding of readers to the H3 tails in the NCP could be reduced by up to a factor of ~10, compared to their binding to the free H3 tail peptide.

### Molecular basis of human usher syndrome: deciphering the meshes of the usher protein network provides insights into the pathomechanisms of the usher disease [^fc660ef2]. Experimental Eye Research (2006). Low credibility.

Usher syndrome (USH) is the most frequent cause of combined deaf-blindness in man. It is clinically and genetically heterogeneous and at least 12 chromosomal loci are assigned to three clinical USH types, namely USH1A-G, USH2A-C, USH3A (Davenport, S.L.H. Omenn, G.S., 1977. The heterogeneity of Usher syndrome. Vth Int. Conf. Birth Defects, Montreal; Petit, C., 2001. Usher syndrome: from genetics to pathogenesis. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2, 271–297). Mutations in USH type 1 genes cause the most severe form of USH. In USH1 patients, congenital deafness is combined with a pre-pubertal onset of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and severe vestibular dysfunctions. Those with USH2 have moderate to severe congenital hearing loss, non-vestibular dysfunction and a later onset of RP. USH3 is characterized by variable RP and vestibular dysfunction combined with progressive hearing loss. The gene products of eight identified USH genes belong to different protein classes and families. There are five known USH1 molecules: the molecular motor myosin VIIa (USH1B); the two cell-cell adhesion cadherin proteins, cadherin 23 (USH1D) and protocadherin 15, (USH1F) and the scaffold proteins, harmonin (USH1C) and SANS (USH1G). In addition, two USH2 genes and one USH3A gene have been identified. The two USH2 genes code for the transmembrane protein USH2A, also termed USH2A ("usherin") and the G-protein-coupled 7-transmembrane receptor VLGR1b (USH2C), respectively, whereas the USH3A gene encodes clarin-1, a member of the clarin family which exhibits 4-transmembrane domains. Molecular analysis of USH1 protein function revealed that all five USH1 proteins are integrated into a protein network via binding to PDZ domains in the USH1C protein harmonin. Furthermore, this scaffold function of harmonin is supported by the USH1G protein SANS. Recently, we have shown that the USH2 proteins USH2A and VLGR1b as well as the candidate for USH2B, the sodium bicarbonate co-transporter NBC3, are also integrated into this USH protein network. In the inner ear, these interactions are essential for the differentiation of hair cell stereocilia but may also participate in the mechano-electrical signal transduction and the synaptic function of maturated hair cells. In the retina, the co-expression of all USH1 and USH2 proteins at the synapse of photoreceptor cells indicates that they are organized in an USH protein network there. The identification of the USH protein network indicates a common pathophysiological pathway in USH. Dysfunction or absence of any of the molecules in the mutual "interactome" related to the USH disease may lead to disruption of the network causing senso-neuronal degeneration in the inner ear and the retina, the clinical symptoms of USH.

### Automated and optimally FRET-assisted structural modeling [^244fff66]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Theory: quality metric to evaluate the information content of sets of FRET pairs

To assess how well a certain set of DA pairs helps to resolve a protein structure, we introduce the quality parameter 〈〈RMSD #conf 〉 #ref 〉, or short 〈〈RMSD〉〉, as a measure to estimate for the expected uncertainty of the model (Supplementary Fig. 9).

Conceptually, to compute 〈〈RMSD〉〉, we first take an arbitrary reference model from the pool of structure models and assume that it corresponds to the "true" structure of the molecule in the experiment. For this reference, a full set of FRET observables is computed. Next, the FRET observables are simulated for all conformers in the pool of structures and compared against the reference set of simulated observables. The simulated observables of the structures are compared to the reference using a χ² test with corresponding P values to yield a conformational uncertainty 〈RMSD #conf 〉 for this reference. This procedure is repeated for all structures from the pool of structures, and the average over all 〈RMSD #conf 〉 is calculated to yield 〈〈RMSD #conf 〉 #ref 〉 (Supplementary Fig. 9).

### Decreased COsaturation during circular breathwork supports emergence of altered States of consciousness [^98304e38]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

To further explore how the physiological and experiential effects of breathwork intersected over time, we jointly visualized the average dynamics of both parameters throughout the session. As shown in Fig. 3C, D, at the beginning of the session, etCO₂ falls and experience depth rises largely in unison. However, in the second half of the session, etCO₂ gradually returns to baseline, while experience depth persists for some time even once etCO₂ begins to return to normal. Interestingly, the passive-breath group also showed qualitatively somewhat similar dynamics of etCO₂ and experience depth as the active-breath group, but confined to a much smaller parameter space (Fig. 3C, D; Correlation between mean trajectories of depth ratings for passive and active breath groups; n = 6 observation time points for active and passive breath each; Holotropic: r = 0.81; p = 0.05; conf.int(r) low = –0.01; conf.int(r) high = 0.98; Conscious-Connected: r = 0.74; p = 0.09; conf.int(r) low = –0.18; conf.int(r) high = 0.97). For examples of how the same dynamics evolve in individual participants, see Supplementary Figs. S1, S3.

### Prior information differentially affects discrimination decisions and subjective confidence reports [^4691dbf3]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Confidence was then modelled as the perceived posterior probability of being correct, combining the prior and likelihood (Fig. 8a). The relative influence of the prior on confidence is captured by w conf. This weighted rightward prior in confidence (p(R) conf) is equal to the decision confidence from the lead decision, with the variance of the prior misestimated according to w conf:

The strength of the likelihood depends on the incoming information from the target stimulus, and was defined as the likelihood of having gotten the internal target signal (r target) if there had been a rightward target stimulus (R, or s target > 0):

Confidence bias, b, acts similarly to the weighting parameters, capturing a misestimation of the variance of information. However, unlike the weighting parameters (which only act on the prior), b captures an equal misestimation of both the prior variance and likelihood variance, and therefore reflects an overall tendency to interpret stimulus information as being either noisier or clearer than it really was. b > 1 reflects a general overestimation of the signal variance, and scales confidence in both choice alternatives towards 50%. b < 1 reflects a general underestimation of the signal variance, and scales confidence in the chosen alternative towards 100% and the rejected alternative towards 0%. While this still captures a general over- or underconfidence, it is different from a report bias, which would just freely shift the final confidence report. This was chosen because we wanted a confidence bias that was more perceptual in nature, and less flexible compared to a report bias, which would overpower the weighting parameters.

The posterior combined the prior and likelihood according to Bayes rule, and confidence in a rightward choice was then computed as:

Confidence in a leftward choice was then equal to (1 - conf right). Similarly to w choice, w conf captured the prior strength that would account for each confidence rating by scaling the variance of the internal prior signal relative to the internal likelihood signal. By implementing these two weighting parameters in the same way, we could then directly compare them. The Flexible model was the only model in which the weighting of the prior information was allowed to differ between discrimination decisions and confidence ratings.

### Prior information differentially affects discrimination decisions and subjective confidence reports [^34c77ca3]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Importantly however, w conf cannot be interpreted in isolation, and must be always considered together with w choice. That is, it is useful to focus on the difference w choice -w conf. In particular, the pattern of results that we described above for the case of w choice = 1 and w conf < 1 is similar to w choice > 1, and an optimal w conf = 1, as both cases correspond to w choice > w conf. The model predicts more extreme confidence (higher for correct, lower for incorrect) in the Stronger-Lead condition (Fig. 4a, far-left panel). The behavioural pattern seen in confidence — of no difference between conditions following correct trials, and lower confidence following incorrect trials in the Stronger-Lead condition — lies somewhere in between the patterns predicted by optimal weighting in confidence (where w conf « w choice) and by equal underweighting in confidence as in decisions (w conf = w choice), and is hence captured when the prior is less underweighted in confidence than in the decision (w conf < w choice) (Fig. 4a, far-right panel).

Fitting the full model individually to each participant yielded a mean w conf = 1.97 (SD = 1.81) across participants. Out of these 20 participants, 15 had a fit w conf value that was smaller than their fit w choice value, indicating stronger weighting of the prior in confidence than in decisions. We did an initial comparison of these individually fit w choice and w conf parameters per participant using a paired samples t-test, which demonstrated that the w choice parameters were significantly larger than the w conf parameters (M Diff = 0.46, SD Diff = 0.69), t(19) = 2.97, p = 0.008, BF₁₀ = 6.25, η²ₚ = 0.32, 95% CI [0.06, 1.00]. This, in line with the behavioural results, suggests the weighting of the prior in confidence to be closer to optimal, compared to the weighting of the prior in decisions. The simulated confidence for these model results (Fig. 4b) successfully captures the pattern associated with the combination of an underweighted prior in decisions and a less underweighted prior in confidence (Fig. 4a, far-right panel).

### ClinGen myeloid malignancy variant curation expert panel recommendations for germline RUNX1 variants [^9e61c63f]. Blood Advances (2019). Medium credibility.

Standardized variant curation is essential for clinical care recommendations for patients with inherited disorders. Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) variant curation expert panels are developing disease-associated gene specifications using the 2015 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) guidelines to reduce curation discrepancies. The ClinGen Myeloid Malignancy Variant Curation Expert Panel (MM-VCEP) was created collaboratively between the American Society of Hematology and ClinGen to perform gene- and disease-specific modifications for inherited myeloid malignancies. The MM-VCEP began optimizing ACMG/AMP rules for RUNX1 because many germline variants have been described in patients with familial platelet disorder with a predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia, characterized by thrombocytopenia, platelet functional/ultrastructural defects, and a predisposition to hematologic malignancies. The 28 ACMG/AMP codes were tailored for RUNX1 variants by modifying gene/disease specifications, incorporating strength adjustments of existing rules, or both. Key specifications included calculation of minor allele frequency thresholds, formulating a semi-quantitative approach to counting multiple independent variant occurrences, identifying functional domains and mutational hotspots, establishing functional assay thresholds, and characterizing phenotype-specific guidelines. Preliminary rules were tested by using a pilot set of 52 variants; among these, 50 were previously classified as benign/likely benign, pathogenic/likely pathogenic, variant of unknown significance (VUS), or conflicting interpretations (CONF) in ClinVar. The application of RUNX1-specific criteria resulted in a reduction in CONF and VUS variants by 33%, emphasizing the benefit of gene-specific criteria and sharing internal laboratory data.

### Prior information differentially affects discrimination decisions and subjective confidence reports [^c04c2096]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

We then examined the model predictions for confidence, given the result of the underweighted priors in decisions (w choice > 1). With overweighting of the prior in confidence (w conf < 1), the Stronger-Lead condition tends to show higher confidence than the Stronger-Target condition for correct trials, and lower for incorrect trials (Fig. 4a, middle-left panel). In other words, w conf < 1 will lead to differences in mean confidence between correct and incorrect that are larger in the Stronger-Lead condition than in the Stronger-Target condition. In contrast, with underweighting of the prior (w conf > 1), it is the Stronger-Target condition that tends to have larger differences in mean confidence between correct and incorrect (Fig. 4a, middle-right panel). If the prior weighting in both decisions and confidence were optimal, the model predicts no difference in mean confidence between conditions.

### SARST2 high-throughput and resource-efficient protein structure alignment against massive databases [^0ede629f]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Computation of the pC-value, a score quality control factor

In this work, we defined a confidence score (Conf) to describe how likely a hit subject is a structural homolog of the query protein. In addition, the negative logarithm with base two of Conf, i.e. the pC-value, was applied as a quality control factor for eliminating hit subjects with low structural similarities to the query, as shown below.where S denotes the structural string similarity score computed by the synthesized DP between the subject and query proteins, and S′ is S being normalized. The theoretical minimum of S, S min, is calculated according to the scoring matrices applied in the synthesized DP such that every query residue is aligned with a residue that produces the lowest score (see Eq. (1)). The theoretical maximum of S, S max, is calculated by aligning the query structural string to itself. TM-score, defined above, quantifies structural similarity based on structural superimposition. The p -score is a probability score obtained by ANN, determining whether a subject is a family-level structural homolog of the query protein (see the next subsection).

The typical range of either S', TM-score, or p -score was [0, 1]; thus, the Conf score also fell into this range. In some rare cases where Conf was lower than 0 or larger than 1, it was set to 0 or 1, respectively. Both Conf and pC-value could be used to remove poorly scored subjects. We actually implemented a Conf score threshold and a pC-value cutoff in the SARST2 standalone program. In contrast with the Conf score, the pC-value describes how unlikely a subject is a structural homolog of the query protein, where a large pC-value implies a poor structural similarity between the subject and the query. The purpose of the pC-value was to be a quality control parameter analogous to BLAST's E-value, for which a high value implies a poor sequence alignment quality between proteins. However, it is noteworthy that the E-value has a solid statistical meaning — the expected number of hits with similar scores (alignment qualities) that could be found in the target database only by chance, whereas the pC-value is simply the negative binary logarithm of the confidence score. A pC-value of x means the confidence score of a hit is [1/2]ˣ.

### In vitro activity of tigecycline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens as evaluated by broth microdilution and etest [^7b331231]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2008). Low credibility.

The current surveillance establishes the activity profile of tigecycline against recent clinical U.S. isolates of target pathogens. Findings from a distributed surveillance that utilized Etest yielded a tigecycline activity profile that varied from that observed in a separate centralized broth microdilution (BMD) surveillance (D. C. Draghi et al. Poster D-0701, 46th Intersci. Conf. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. San Francisco, CA). Differences were noted among Acinetobacter spp. and Serratia marcescens and, to a lesser extent, with Streptococcus pyogenes. To address whether these differences were due to discordance in testing methodology or to variations among the analyzed populations, isolates from the current surveillance were concurrently tested by BMD and Etest. In all, 1,800 Staphylococcus aureus, 259 S. pyogenes, 226 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 93 Enterococcus faecalis, 1,356 Enterobacteriaceae, and 227 Acinetobacter baumannii strains were evaluated. Tigecycline had potent activity by BMD, with > 99.6% susceptibility (%S) observed for all pathogens with interpretive criteria, excluding Enterobacter cloacae (98.3% S) and E. faecalis (86.0% S), and MIC(90)s ranged from 0.03 mug/ml (S. pyogenes/S. pneumoniae) to 1 mug/ml (Enterobacteriaceae/A. baumannii). Similar profiles were observed by Etest, with the exception of A. baumannii, although for most evaluated pathogens Etest MICs trended one doubling-dilution higher than BMD MICs. Major or very major errors were infrequent, and a high degree of essential agreement was observed, excluding A. baumannii, S. marcescens, and S. pneumoniae, for which ≥ 4-fold differences in MICs were observed for 29, 27.1, and 34% of the isolates, respectively. Further analysis regarding the suitability of the tigecycline Etest for testing S. marcescens, Acinetobacter spp., and S. pneumoniae is warranted.

### High-resolution in situ structures of mammalian respiratory supercomplexes [^b4edf598]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

At the Qₒ site, QH₂ releases two protons into the intermembrane space as part of its reaction cycle. Our high-resolution map clearly resolved a prevalent Q-binding conformation at this site, characterized by π–π stacking interactions with F274 MTCYB (Fig. 4e). Similar to the Qᵢ site, there was also a hydrogen-bonded water chain near the Qₒ site for proton transfer. Notably, residue E271 MTCYB, engaged in this water chain, exhibited clear dual conformations (Conf. 1 and Conf. 2) and is likely to play a critical part in proton transfer (Fig. 4e). The two conformations resembled those of two previously reported crystal structures in the apo state(Conf. 1) and with the Qₒ inhibitor stigmatellin bound(Conf. 2), respectively (Fig. 4f). Further structural comparison indicated that the headgroup of stigmatellin lies closer to the ISP than the endogenous QH₂ captured in our in situ structure. Focused 3D classification uncovered a less-populated (approximately 13%) Q-binding state (Fig. 4g) at the Qₒ site with its headgroup shifted around 6 Å closer towards the ISP compared with the dominant form (Fig. 4h, i). We propose that this state, rather than the dominant class, represents a transient electron-hopping phase from QH₂ to [2Fe–2S] in ISP.

### Dynamic contrast enhancement and flexible odor codes [^4ed74979]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Sensory stimuli evoke spiking activities patterned across neurons and time that are hypothesized to encode information about their identity. Since the same stimulus can be encountered in a multitude of ways, how stable or flexible are these stimulus-evoked responses? Here we examine this issue in the locust olfactory system. In the antennal lobe, we find that both spatial and temporal features of odor-evoked responses vary in a stimulus-history dependent manner. The response variations are not random, but allow the antennal lobe circuit to enhance the uniqueness of the current stimulus. Nevertheless, information about the odorant identity is conf ounded due to this contrast enhancement computation. Notably, predictions from a linear logical classifier (OR-of-ANDs) that can decode information distributed in flexible subsets of neurons match results from behavioral experiments. In sum, our results suggest that a trade-off between stability and flexibility in sensory coding can be achieved using a simple computational logic.

### Maximal mechanical power during a taper in elite swimmers [^958789a0]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Insight regarding the fluctuations in neuromuscular function among athletes during a taper is lacking.

Purpose

This study examined the time course of changes in maximal mechanical power (Pmax), torque at power maximum (T), velocity at power maximum (V), and swim performance (m × s⁻¹) that occur during the taper.

Methods

Using an arm ergometer with inertial loading, measurements were made during the week prior to the initiation of the taper (high volume, HV), during the 2- to 3-wk period of the taper (taper), and during the week of peak competition (peak) in 24 male competitive collegiate swimmers. Subjects were divided into groups that tapered to peak performance at either the conference (CONF, N = 13) or national (NAT, N = 11) championship competitions.

Results

CONF increased Pmax 10.2% (P < 0.01) and swim performance 4.4% (P < 0.001). NAT increased Pmax by 11.6% (P < 0.01), T by 7.4% (P < 0.02), and swim performance by 4.7% (P < 0.001). Pmax displayed a biphasic increase with approximately 50, 5, and 45% of the total increase occurring during the first, second, and third weeks of the taper, respectively. The biphasic response was the most common response among individual swimmers. Swimming performance was significantly correlated to both power and torque (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

In summary, maximal arm power measured using inertial load ergometry increased largely during the first and third weeks after training volume was tapered for peak performance in elite collegiate swimmers.

### Concurrent diffusion of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and fluorescent cholesterol disclosed by two-colour sub-millisecond MINFLUX-based single-molecule tracking [^bc4f1c10]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

A squared confined domain L is taken for the sake of simplicity, but any 2D geometric shape can be consideredin the:

Having obtained the expressions for MSD conf and MSD free, MSD hop can be rewritten for 2D tracks as:

such that diffusion coefficients D µ and D M are separated by a length scale L hop.

Application of this analysis returned in some cases a D M ≈ 0. For this reason, we decided to include MSD conf within the scope of the analysis.

Thus far, MSD hop and MSD free do not include corrections for measurement artefacts. To account for these, MSD hop and MSD free were rewrittenas:

Because MSD conf is equal to MSD hop when D M = 0, MSD conf is rewritten as:

In the case of MSD free, the free parameters are D and σ. In the case of MSD hop, the free parameters are D M, D µ, L hop, and σ. Finally, in the case of MSD conf, the free parameters are D µ, L hop, and σ. MSD free derived in Eq. 12 has a different nomenclature but is essentially the same expression employed by Hell and coworkers.

To classify trajectories, the following steps were followed: (1) an MSD curve was calculated for each trajectory; (2) the initial 20% data points of the MSD curves were fitted to MSD free, MSD hop, and MSD conf solving three non-linear optimisation problems; the free parameters were adjusted such that the sum of the squared residuals (SSR) of both regressions on the observed data were minimised. We used the Python-based software package SciPy to solve this optimisation problem 100 times (the solution with the least SSR was picked for each case). MSD points were sampled logarithmically to emphasise the fitting to the initial 20% MSD points. (3) Next, the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was calculated for both fits:where n and k are the number of data points and number of fit parameters, respectively.

### Decreased COsaturation during circular breathwork supports emergence of altered States of consciousness [^0ff5c8a1]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

To test if the follow-up improvements in mental well-being for the active-breath group were a direct result of the physiological and/or experiential processes they encountered throughout the session, we quantified how well changes in QIDS-SR16 and WEMBWS scores were predicted by (1) reduced etCO₂ during the session, and (2) MEQ30 and 11-DASC scores. Figure 4E shows prominent links between acute session parameters and subsequent changes in well-being, as measured by the WEMWBS. Specifically, subacute increases in WEMWBS scores were predicted by lower etCO₂ (r = –0.49; conf.int(r) low = –0.75; conf.int(r) high = –0.13; df = 23; p = 0.011) during the session, as well as by deeper ASCs, as reflected by higher scores in the MEQ30 (r = 0.44; conf.int(r) low = 0.03; conf.int(r) high = 0.71; df = 23; p = 0.031) and in the 'Oceanic boundlessness' subscale of the 11-DASC (r = 0.54; conf.int(r) low = 0.17; conf.int(r) high = 0.76; df = 23; p = 0.006).

### Minding the gap between logic and intuition: an interpretative approach to ethical analysis [^96b3a144]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2007). Low credibility.

In an attempt to be rational and objective, and, possibly, to avoid the charge of moral relativism, ethicists seek to categorise and characterise ethical dilemmas. This approach is intended to minimise the effect of the confusing individuality of the context within which ethically challenging problems exist. Despite and I argue partly as a result of this attempt to be rational and objective, even when the logic of the argument is accepted — for example, by healthcare professionals — those same professionals might well respond by stating that the conclusions are unacceptable to them. In this paper, I argue that an interpretative approach to ethical analysis, involving an examination of the ways in which ethical arguments are constructed and shared, can help ethicists to understand the origins of this gap between logic and intuition. I suggest that an argument will be persuasive either if the values underpinning the proposed argument accord with the reader's values and worldview, or if the argument succeeds in persuading the reader to alter these. A failure either to appreciate or to acknowledge those things that give meaning to the lives of all the interested parties will make this objective far harder, if not impossible, to achieve. If, as a consequence, the narratives ethicists use to make their arguments seem to be about people living in different circumstances, and faced with different choices and challenges, from those the readers or listeners consider important or have to face in their own lives, then the argument is unlikely to seem either relevant or applicable to those people. The conclusion offered by the ethicist will be, for that individual, counterintuitive. Abortion, euthanasia and cadaveric organ donation are used as examples to support my argument.

### Triazolam [^59f91090]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Semantic clinical artificial intelligence vs native large language model performance on the USMLE [^6bec16e5]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Semantic Triples and Knowledge Graphs for Clinical Knowledge

Clinical domain–specific knowledge, needed for question answering and differential diagnosis, can be represented as knowledge graphs based on formal logic. According to Murali et al", a knowledge graph crafted from medical concepts, events, and relationships acts as a medical semantic network to extract new links and hidden patterns from health data sources". Nodes in the graph represent concepts, such as a medication or disease, and arcs represent relations between concepts, such as treats (ie, 1 concept treats another). Well-known medical semantic networks include Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine–Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT), the Unified Medical Language System, and DrugBank.

Semantic triples are a simple form of a semantic network. Semantic triples take the form subject-relation-object (eg, penicillin [subject] treats [relation] pneumococcal pneumonia [object]) (Figure 1). When semantic networks are represented with formal logic (eg, description logic), it is possible to draw logical inferences (ie, to reason) from them using software tools, such as classifiers. Classification tasks are part of many types of reasoning.

Figure 1.
Semantic Triples and Knowledge Graphs

The knowledge graphs may contain 1 or more semantic triples. Two semantic triples are combined at the lower right of the figure. Numbers signify Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine–Clinical Terms codes. OWL indicates W3C Web Ontology Language.

Study Objective

We used RAG and semantic triples to develop a method named semantic clinical artificial intelligence (SCAI; pronounced sky) to semantically augment transformer-based LLMs. Our hypothesis was that augmenting native LLMs with relevant clinical knowledge as semantic triples would improve accuracy and decrease confabulation. We tested our hypothesis between June 2024 and February 2025 by comparing the performance of 3 native LLMs against their SCAI RAG–enhanced counterparts on Steps 1, 2, and 3 of the USMLE. The USMLE, required for licensure of allopathic physicians in all 50 states, is a 3-step examination taken throughout a medical student's education. The USMLE "assesses a physician's ability to apply knowledge, concepts, and principles, and to demonstrate fundamental patient-centered skills, that are important in health and disease and that constitute the basis of safe and effective patient care".

### Effective use of tables and figures in abstracts, presentations, and papers [^9d553efc]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

In some situations, tables, graphs, and figures can present certain types of information (including complicated relationships and sequences of events) more clearly and in less space than the same information would require in sentence form. However, do not use tables, graphs, and figures for small amounts of data that could be conveyed clearly and succinctly in a sentence. Also, do not reiterate in sentences the data that are shown in a table, graph, or figure: the point of creating a table or graph or figure is to eliminate that type of sentence from your manuscript. In building a data table you must balance the necessity that the table be complete with the equally important necessity that it not be too complex. Sometimes it is helpful to break a large table into several smaller ones to allow the reader to identify important information easily, but, conversely, it is a common mistake of novice authors to split up into several tables data that belong in one table. In almost all cases, only one table or graph or figure should be included in an abstract, and then only if it can convey essential information in less space and in a more easily interpretable way than the sentence form. For a poster, in almost all instances you should use only one typeface and one font in a table, graph, or figure. In general, do not use bold, italics, or color unless you are presenting a great deal of data and you need to highlight certain data values and you are certain that using bold, italics, or color will improve readability, which is rare. Do not include identical information in a table and a graph/figure. In reporting a clinical trial you will need to include a patient flow chart that identifies the number of patients initially screened for the study, the number of patients who were excluded (and why) after initial screening or in the final analysis, and how many patients entered, exited early, and completed each arm of the study. A treatment protocol should also be described with a flow chart. In preparing a graph the most common error is to include a line that suggests an unsubstantiated extrapolation between or beyond the data points. In selecting the graph's axes, avoid truncating, enlarging, or compressing the axes in ways that might make the graph confusing or misleading. To prepare clear, accurate, easily interpretable tables, graphs, and figures, rely on the rules described in authoritative guides such as the Council of Science Editors' Scientific Style and Format and the American Medical Association's Manual of Style.

### Robustness of patient positioning for interfractional error in carbon ion radiotherapy for stage I lung cancer: bone matching versus tumor matching [^0e60bd0b]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Patient positioning was compared by tumor matching (TM) and conventional bony structure matching (BM) in carbon ion radiotherapy for stage I non-small cell lung cancer to evaluate the robustness of TM and BM in determining interfractional error.

Material and Methods

Sixty irradiation fields were analyzed. Computed tomography (CT) images acquired before treatment initiation for confirmation (Conf-CT) were obtained under the same settings as the treatment planning CT images and used to evaluate both positioning methods. The dose distributions were recalculated for Conf-CT using both BM and TM, and the dose-volume histogram parameters [V 95% of clinical target volume, V 5Gy(RBE) of normal lung, and acceptance ratio (ratio of cases with V 95% > 95%)] were evaluated. The required margin, which in 90% of cases achieved the acceptable condition, was also examined.

Results

Using BM and TM, the median V 95% was 98.93% and 100% (p < 0.001) and the mean V 5Gy(RBE) was 135.9 and 125.8 (p = 0.694), respectively. The estimated required margins were 7.9 and 3.3 mm and increased by 53.9% and 2.5% of V 5Gy(RBE), respectively, compared with planning.

Conclusions

TM ensured a better dose distribution than did BM. To enable TM, volumetric imaging is crucial and should replace 2D radiographs for carbon therapy of stage I lung cancer.

### Dosimetric comparisons between high dose rate interstitial and mammoSite balloon brachytherapy for breast cancer [^deeb684c]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

To make a quantitative dosimetric comparison between treatment plans of multicatheter-based interstitial brachytherapy (IB) and MammoSite brachytherapy (MSB) for breast cancer.

Patients and Methods

Seventeen patients treated with IB and twenty-four with MSB were selected for the study. The irradiations for IB patients were planned using conventional two-film reconstruction technique. Following the implantation each patient was CT scanned, then the planning target volume (PTV) was retrospectively defined on the CT data set, and the original plan was reconstructed (CONV plans). Furthermore, conformal plans were also created by dose optimization on target (CONF plans). The planning for MammoSite applicator was based on CT imaging. The dose distributions were evaluated with dose-volume histograms. The following parameters were calculated and compared: volume of the PTV and its percentage receiving 90, 100, 150 and 200% of the prescribed dose (V90, V100, V150 and V200, respectively), percentage dose covering 90% of the PTV (D90), minimum dose in the PTV (D(min)), maximum dose in the PTV (D(max)) for MSB only, dose homogeneity index (DHI), and conformal index (COIN). To assess the dose to organs at risk maximum point dose to skin, lung and heart was used.

Results

The median number of implanted catheters for IB was 11 (range: 6–13), the average balloon volume for MSB was 59.1cm(3) (range: 43.4–75.3 cm(3)). The average volume of PTV was 63.4 and 109.6 cm(3) for IB and MSB patients, respectively. The average V90, V100, V150, V200 were 76, 70, 26 and 9% for IB(CONV); 92, 87, 55 and 32% for IB(CONF) and 96, 88, 27 and 3% for MSB, respectively. The average D90 was 72, 94 and 99%, the D(min) was 47, 58 and 67%, respectively. The mean D(max) was 258% for MSB. The average DHI was 0.63, 0.37 and 0.70 for IB(CONV), IB(CONF) and MSB, respectively. D(max) to skin, lung and heart were 45, 54 and 31% for IB(CONV), 50, 55 and 29% for IB(CONF,) 97, 66 and 27% for MSB, respectively.

Conclusions

Target volume coverage was better for MSB than conventional IB, and it was comparable to conformal IB. The suboptimal coverage for IB patients is due to radiography based planning, which is unable to provide 3D information of the target. Dose homogeneity was somewhat better for MSB than IB(CONV), but the dose to skin and lung was higher for MSB. The MSB provides dosimetrically acceptable dose plans. The quality of interstitial implants can be improved with image-guided catheter insertions regarding both homogeneity and conformality.

### Literary, found and research poetry: new approaches to representations of aging and aged care [^89898cc7]. The Gerontologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Perhaps most importantly, the lyric poem is intended to be memorable: unlike other forms of literature, including novels, nonfiction, or memoir, the lyric poem can often be heard and understood in a single sitting, and can be memorized, remembered, and repeated, which links to its origins as a form accompanied by music. This is because a successful lyric poem is not only memorable for its subject matter — grief, happiness, lost love, for example — but also for the exact expression of those ideas.

Although the lyric poem invites intimacy with the reader, and a sense of secrets being overheard, the poet is also free to invent, to conflate events, or even to lie in the service of art, even within seemingly confessional poems: this is because in reading a literary poem, as with a novel, there is a presumption of distance between the real-life author who has written it and the poem's speaker, no matter how closely the poem seems to invite a biographical reading. The reader of the lyric poem often will flicker between occupying both the speaker's "I" and the "you" of the addressee, entering into a complex interplay of identifications, a "being spoken through as well as speaking".

By contrast, the research poem — especially the found poem — has no underlying intention to be original, given that it derives all of its words from a pre-existing text. The research poet is entirely constrained by the word choice, word order, thought patterns, and speech of the subject; given that most research poems are sourced from interview transcripts, testimony, or other more quotidian forms of language, the research poet must also grapple with the inevitable redundancies, repetition, and awkward phrasings that exist in extemporaneous speech. These factors narrow the poetic possibilities considerably, given that the research poet can only work with the existing words in the order they appear in the source text — but they also set differing expectations for both the poet's poetic expression and the effect on the reader.

### Clinical practice guidelines: diagnosis, treatment, and management of children and adults with central auditory processing disorder [^0a1b25b3]. AAA (2010). Medium credibility.

Central auditory processing disorder (C)APD assessment — case history, ancillary information, and direct observation — emphasizes that case history information can be obtained through standard clinical interview procedures and may involve interviewing the patient, his/her parents or other family members, or another informant who is responsible for the patient, and a review of available medical, educational, and clinical records can help to further elucidate the nature of the problems or difficulties that the individual is experiencing. Case history review can also serve to document the presence or absence of any comorbid condition(s) and help inform professional decisions regarding (1) the need to modify diagnostic test procedures or protocols, (2) the need to refer for follow-up cognitive, speech and language, educational, and/or behavioral testing, and (3) the need to consider modifications to the intervention plan if a (C) APD is identified and the individual is also experiencing a comorbid condition or conditions. Ancillary information can also be gained through direct observation of the individual's behaviors during the interview itself or in some other context, and completion of behavioral inventories and/or checklists by people familiar with the individual also provides useful insights into functional deficits, diagnostic test selection, and intervention priorities. Self-assessment tools and/or behavioral checklists completed by individuals familiar with the individual can provide the audiologist with important insights into the individual's specific auditory deficits and the functional impact of these deficits, and there are a number of instruments that can be used for this purpose, including some developed specifically for use with individuals who may be at-risk for (C)APD and others that are more generic. Direct observation of the individual at-risk for (C)APD can provide additional information about the individual's auditory behaviors and difficulties, and the audiologist can gain invaluable insights during the interview process as well as throughout the diagnostic process by carefully observing the individual's behavior. Although more difficult to arrange, the direct observation of the individual in a naturalistic setting, such as in school or at work, is potentially more revealing than the observation of the individual in the clinical setting, and direct observation complements and supplements the case history interview. The answers to these types of questions can inform the audiologist's selection of tests for inclusion in the test battery, and will also provide a solid foundation for intervention planning should the individual ultimately be diagnosed with a (C)APD. Levels of evidence: 4, 5.

### A time to be promoted. the prospective study of promotion in academia (prospective study of promotion in academia) [^7631139c]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The study's objectives were to determine (1) the rate at which department of medicine faculty in the United States are promoted, (2) if clinician-educators (CEs) are promoted to Associate Professor at the same rate as clinician-investigators (CIs), and (3) the variables that predict promotion.

Methods

The Prospective Study of Promotion in Academia was a part-retrospective, part-prospective (from 2000 to 2003) cohort study. Six-hundred and four Internal Medicine junior faculty across the United States who had been registered as new appointees with the Association of American Medical Colleges in 1995 were invited to participate. Twenty-one percent of these had already left their institution when the study began. One hundred and eighty-three Internal Medicine faculty from 87 institutions in 35 states enrolled. The main outcome measure was the time from appointment as Assistant Professor to promotion to Associate Professor.

Results

Follow-up was complete for all 183 faculty. Among the faculty that achieved promotion, the estimated median time to promotion was 6.0 years (95% Conf. Int. = 5.8 to 6.2). The unadjusted sixth-year promotion rate for CEs was 16%, while for CIs it was 26% (P = 0.002). Independent negative predictors of promotion included low amount of research time (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 0.3, 95% Conf. Int. = 0.2 to 0.5), having a manuscript review service (HR = 0.4, 95% Conf. Int. = 0.2 to 0.7), never meeting with Chairman/Chief about promotion (HR = 0.4, 95% Conf. Int. = 0.2 to 0.7), low job satisfaction (HR = 0.5, 95% Conf. Int. = 0.3 to 0.9), and working in the Northeast (HR = 0.6, 95% Conf. Int. = 0.4 to 1.1). Positive predictors included making between 130 dollars and 149,000 dollars per year (HR = 1.9, 95% Conf. Int. = 1.1 to 3.4), working more than 60 h/wk (HR = 1.9, 95% Conf. Int. = 1.1 to 3.0), having a career mentor available (HR = 1.8, 95% Conf. Int. = 1.1 to 2.9), and having access to a grant office (HR = 1.6, 95% Conf. Int. = 1.0 to 2.6).

Conclusion

CEs and CIs appear to be promoted at different rates. The characteristics that are independently associated with earlier promotion may be helpful for institutions and individual faculty that are committed to achieving promotion efficiently.

### Clinical practice guidelines: diagnosis, treatment, and management of children and adults with central auditory processing disorder [^13ac38af]. AAA (2010). Medium credibility.

Central auditory processing disorder (C)APD — speech versus non-speech test stimuli: Behavioral tests may be categorized as speech or non-speech (verbal and non-verbal). There has been an increased focus on utilizing non-speech tasks to minimize the confounding influence of language on an individual's performance. However, speech tasks remain an important component of the (C)APD test battery, as CANS deficits are often apparent for speech signals in children and adults on both psychophysical and electrophysiologic measures, with reported Levels of evidence: 2, 3.

### Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a novel fibrotic mediator in the eye [^5e063b76]. Experimental Eye Research (2008). Low credibility.

Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a pleiotropic lysolipid that has recently been implicated in the regulation of tissue fibrosis. However, the fibrogenic potential of S1P in the eye has not previously been investigated. In the current study, we evaluated cells from the anterior and posterior segments of the eye for the presence of S1P and their potential ability to produce and respond to S1P. In addition, we investigated the regulatory role of S1P as a mediator of proliferation, cellular transformation and pro-fibrotic protein expression in human retinal pigmented epithelial cells. Expression of S1P receptors and sphingosine kinases (the enzymes that produce S1P) was examined using RT-PCR, and intracellular localization of S1P was examined using immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry and ELISA in primary human retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells, primary human conjunctival fibroblasts (ConF), and primary human corneal fibroblasts (CF). RPE cell proliferation was determined using an MTT-based cell proliferation assay, and RPE myofibroblast transformation, collagen type I production and profibrotic protein expression were assessed using immunofluorescence, ELISA and immunoblot. S1P(1–3, 5) receptors and sphingosine kinases 1 and 2 were expressed and intracellular pools of S1P were detected in RPE cells, ConF and CF. S1P stimulated RPE cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. S1P induced myofibroblast transformation of RPE cells, as indicated by increased alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) expression and its incorporation into prominent stress fibers, and promoted collagen type I production. S1P stimulated the expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and heat shock protein 47 (HSP47), two proteins that are linked to increased tissue fibrosis. Combined, these data demonstrate that RPE cells, ConF and CF from the human eye not only have the molecular ability to produce and respond to S1P, but also contain S1P. Furthermore, S1P promotes proliferation, myofibroblast transformation, collagen production and pro-fibrotic protein expression by human RPE cells. These data suggest that S1P is a previously unrecognized mediator of profibrotic cellular function and signaling in the eye.

### Stereotactic radiotherapy for peripheral lung tumors: a comparison of volumetric modulated arc therapy with 3 other delivery techniques [^8f594135]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Volumetric modulated arc therapy (RapidArc) allows for fast delivery of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) delivery in stage I lung tumors. We compared dose distributions and delivery times between RapidArc and common delivery techniques in small tumors.

Methods

In 18 patients who completed RapidArc SBRT for tumors measuring < 70 cm(3), new treatment plans were generated using non-coplanar 3D conformal fields (conf-SBRT) and dynamic conformal arc radiotherapy (DCA). For 9 patients with tumors adjacent to the chest wall, co-planar intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) plans were also generated. PTV dose coverage, organs at risk (OAR) doses and treatment delivery times were assessed.

Results

RapidArc plans achieved a superior conformity index (CI) and lower V(45 Gy) to chest wall (p < 0.05) compared to all other techniques. RapidArc led to a small increase in V(5 Gy) to contralateral lung compared to conf-SBRT (4.4 ± 4% versus 1.2 ± 1.8%, p = 0.011). For other OAR, RapidArc and conf-SBRT plans were comparable, and both were superior to DCA plans. Delivery of a 7.5 Gy-fraction required 3.9 min (RapidArc), 11.6 min (conf-SBRT), and 12 min (IMRT).

Conclusions

In stage I lung tumors measuring < 70 cm(3), RapidArc plans achieved both the highest dose conformity and shortest delivery times.

### The perspectives and experiences of older LGBTI + adults about long-term care: a qualitative systematic review and meta-synthesis [^233cf018]. The Gerontologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Data Extraction

Data were extracted in two phases. In both instances, a data extraction tool was piloted and amended following extraction of a sample of 20 studies in duplicate by S. McMullen-Roach and C. Murray/S. Kumar. S. McMullen-Roach completed remaining extraction in consultation with C. Murray/S. Kumar. Initially extraction included the study characteristics and then study findings (see Figure 1).

Figure 1.
Data synthesis. LGBTI+ = Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex.

Data Synthesis

The data synthesis followedseven-step method for conducting a meta-ethnographic synthesis. Steps 1 and 2, as identified in Figure 1, included the rationale and study selection process. Step 3 (Figure 1) enabled the extraction of first- and second-order constructs from the full primary studies; following this, the research team collaborated to identify how concepts were related within studies (Step 4), before reviewing how the studies translated into one another (Step 5). The process of translation incorporated both reciprocal (similar) and refutational (opposite) data, where the findings across multiple studies were able to be brought together to represent one concept. These concepts were then grouped by S. McMullen-Roach, C. Murray, and S. Kumar. Once this was completed, S. McMullen-Roach developed third-order concepts (Step 6), using concept maps, which were discussed and worked on collaboratively by the entire research team. Context, participant groups, and study aims were all considered within this process. The concept maps led to the development of initial themes and subthemes, which were discussed, modified, and re-created. Regular discussions were held with the research team and SMR kept a reflexive journal of decisions made and reasons for the decisions. Themes were further refined, and then Stage 7 (expressing the synthesis) was completed by means of a community consultation. See Supplementary Material Section 2 for full details on community consultation.

### Understanding, comprehensibility and acceptance of an evidence-based consumer information brochure on fall prevention in old age: a focus group study [^994997ce]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Pictogram

The pictogram displaying 1000 stick-figures divided into three groups illustrated the effectiveness of counselling on home environment modification to prevent falls: Over 12 months 414 out of 1000 seniors experienced at least one accidental fall despite counselling, 372 of these 1000 seniors would not have fallen anyway, and 214 seniors had a benefit because they did not fall due to the counselling. The majority of the participants who gave a comment judged the pictogram as redundant (9/4), confusing and even not suitable to the needs of elderly people (8/1). Two seniors stated: "Figure four (pictogram) makes a reader feel treated as if he is in first or second grade". (FG 1); "I racked my brain over page 38 (pictogram). Why are there all those people?" (FG 4). Other participants liked the pictogram (10/2). Some participants argued that it is obvious that interventions can never be a hundred percent prevention of a fall (4/2). Participants suggested a table presenting numbers instead of the pictogram (2/2).

Further information and glossary

Participants agreed to the information about further reading, addresses and the glossary. They appreciated the length of both chapters (9/3) and judged them as interesting and informative (3/2). Two seniors from FG 7 commented: "Chapter 6 (further information) I also find interesting as a piece of information".; "Chapter 7 (glossary) is quite interesting for one's information". Some participants claimed not to have used these chapters (11/3). Two participants found both chapters easy to understand (2/1).

Rating within groups of different educational levels

In order to explore the different judgements in relation to participants' educational background, the sample was divided into five groups: no job training, semiskilled, apprenticeship, training college and university. The judgements of the educational groups were set in relation to the average Likert scale rating assigned. It turned out that the different educational groups rated the brochure almost identically. Participants with a university degree or apprenticeship and semiskilled persons rated the brochure with a mean Likert scale rating of 2.5. Participants who visited a training college and participants without job training assigned a mean Likert scale rating of 3.

### Geometric cues stabilise long-axis polarisation of PAR protein patterns in C. elegans [^da259814]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Fig. 6
Cell polarisation in three dimensions.

a Image series from FEM (Comsol) simulation for D cyt = 6 μm² s⁻¹, and reactivation rate λ = 0.21 s⁻¹. The series illustrates the different times which are further analysed: the time from the initial aPAR-dominated unpolarised state to the initial short-axis polarisation, T initial; the time duration of persistent short-axis polarisation, T pers; and the time the pattern takes to turn from short- to long-axis polarisation, T trans. b The angle Θ of the concentration maximum of membrane-bound A 1 is plotted against simulation time for different D cyt indicated in the graph. c T initial, T pers, T trans plotted as a function of D cyt for λ = 0.09 s −1 and λ = 0.3 s −1. d The magnitude of the transition time from short- to long-axis polarisation, T trans, in D cyt - λ parameter space; a cell was considered to be polarised along the short axis if 90° − 10° ≤ Θ ≤ 90° + 10°. The monochrome cyan-coloured region above the grey line corresponds to a parameter region where there is no short-axis polarisation, but the polarisation axis is aligned along the diagonal or long axis from the beginning. The dashed lines demarcate parameter regimes where the initial polarisation is aligned perfectly with the short axis (Θ = 90°) or with the long axis, as indicated in the graph.

We observe that, as for the two-dimensional case, initial long-axis polarisation is favoured for large cytosolic diffusion constants D cyt and low reactivation rates λ, while initial short-axis polarisation is favoured for the diametrically opposed case; compare Fig. 6 d with Fig. 3 d. This shows that the local membrane-to-bulk ratio is indeed the main factor that determines initial axis selection. Moreover, the persistence time T pers (Fig. 6 c) and the transition time T trans (Fig. 6 c, d) both depend strongly on D cyt, but only weakly on λ. In the regime with a clear preference for short-axis polarisation (below the dashed line in Fig. 6 d), T trans becomes as large as several hours; for reference see Fig. 6 d with ℓ ⋆ ≈ 7 μm; for further discussion and results on time scales, see also Supplementary Note 8 and Supplementary Fig. 8.

### Clinical predictors of injuries not identified by focused abdominal sonogram for trauma (FAST) examinations [^5b08453e]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

This study's objective was to identify clinical characteristics of patients with a blunt traumatic injury that increased the risk of peritoneal or pericardial fluid collections and abdominal organ injuries not identified by a bedside focused abdominal sonogram for trauma (FAST) examination. This observational study used a retrospective chart review of a cohort of patients identified through a query of the University of Nebraska Medical Center's trauma registry, a tertiary referral center for portions of Nebraska, Iowa, and Missouri. Adult patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) for an evaluation of blunt traumatic injury from September 1996 to December 2002 were eligible if their ED course included admission to the trauma service after completion of a bedside FAST examination (US) and a confirmatory study (Conf) such as an abdominopelvic computed tomography scan or exploratory laparotomy within 12 h of completion of the ED FAST examination. The medical records of those patients with a US+/Conf+ or US-/Conf+ examination were reviewed. Clinical characteristics were recorded on a standard data collection form. Statistically significant predictors of a US-/Conf+ examination were found using a stepwise logistic regression procedure. A query of the trauma registry for the study period revealed 1453 adult individuals with blunt abdominal trauma, with 458 patients meeting the inclusion criteria. The clinical characteristics of the 79 US+/Conf+ examinations were compared to those of the 53 US-/Conf+ examinations. The presence of a radiographically proven pelvic fracture (odds ratio 3.459; 95% confidence interval of 1.308–9.157) and a radiographically or operatively proven renal injury (odds ratio 3.667; 95% confidence interval of 1.013–13.275) were found to be significant predictors. The presence of a pelvic fracture or renal injury in adult victims of blunt abdominal trauma increases the likelihood of a US-/Conf+ examination. Patients with a negative FAST examination and pelvic fracture may benefit from additional radiographic or operative evaluations for occult injuries.

Effect measures

Item 12. Specify for each outcome the effect measure(s) (such as risk ratio, mean difference) used in the synthesis or presentation of results

Explanation: To interpret a synthesised or study result, users need to know what effect measure was used. Effect measures refer to statistical constructs that compare outcome data between two groups. For instance, a risk ratio is an example of an effect measure that might be used for dichotomous outcomes. The chosen effect measure has implications for interpretation of the findings and might affect the meta-analysis results (such as heterogeneity). Authors might use one effect measure to synthesise results and then re-express the synthesised results using another effect measure. For example, for meta-analyses of standardised mean differences, authors might re-express the combined results in units of a well known measurement scale, and for meta-analyses of risk ratios or odds ratios, authors might re-express results in absolute terms (such as risk difference). Furthermore, authors need to interpret effect estimates in relation to whether the effect is of importance to decision makers. For a particular outcome and effect measure, this requires specification of thresholds (or ranges) used to interpret the size of effect (such as minimally important difference; ranges for no/trivial, small, moderate, and large effects).

Essential elements

Specify for each outcome or type of outcome (such as binary, continuous) the effect measure(s) (such as risk ratio, mean difference) used in the synthesis or presentation of results.
State any thresholds or ranges used to interpret the size of effect (such as minimally important difference; ranges for no/trivial, small, moderate, and large effects) and the rationale for these thresholds.
If synthesised results were re-expressed to a different effect measure, report the methods used to re-express results (such as meta-analysing risk ratios and computing an absolute risk reduction based on an assumed comparator risk).

Working with professional medical interpreters — definition, access, and best practices — notes that "Medical interpretation is the accurate, complete, and objective transmission of oral messages between healthcare professionals and patients who do not share a language. This can be done in person, by phone, or via video", and that "Working effectively with professionally trained medical interpreters is a skill set required for timely and effective communication that can minimize poor health outcomes". Directives include "Provide patients with professional interpretation services even if they have a friend or family member with them who can help communicate. Never use a child as an interpreter", "Make patients aware of their right to professional medical interpreters free of charge with the assurance of confidentiality in the healthcare encounter", and "Always confirm the language and dialect when arranging for an interpreter". Additional practices are "Prepare for extra time. Interpreted encounters tend to take more time than when the healthcare professional and patient speak the same language. Remember that each statement is uttered twice through interpretation, and clarification may be needed", "Allow interpreters to introduce themselves and explain their role in a brief statement to both patient and provider", and "Consider creating specific resources, like glossaries, to improve cross-cultural communication of standardized health terms through a rigorous translation and cultural validation process".

### European council of legal medicine (ECLM) guidelines for the examination of suspected elder abuse [^be6a226f]. International Journal of Legal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on elder abuse:

- **Definition**: Elder abuse is a violation of human rights, defined as a single or repeated act or a failure to act that causes harm, risk of harm, or distress to an older adult (aged 60 years or older) by a trusted individual such as a family member or caregiver.
- **Pathophysiology**: Elder abuse can be physical, sexual, emotional, psychological, and/or financial. It can also be the result of intentional or unintentional neglect and abandonment.
- **Epidemiology**: It is estimated that as many as 1 in 10 older adults in the US have been victims of elder abuse, with most cases occurring in women.
- **Risk factors**: Factors contributing to the risk of elder abuse in vulnerable patients include disabilities, being homebound, cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety, and social isolation.
- **Disease course**: Common findings of elder abuse include signs of non-accidental trauma such as patches of alopecia (single or multiple), contusions (on the scalp, retroauricular and periorbital areas, ears, nasal bridge, inner side of arms or thighs, palm, buttocks, anogenital, soles), wrist or ankle injuries (suggesting ligature or restrain), ecchymoses or other injuries inside the lips and buccal mucosa, cluster bruises from finger pressure (especially on the arms and chest), pinch or grab marks, or hand-shaped marks (from slapping), fractures not involving the hip, humerus, or vertebra (more common in accidental settings), injuries in various stages of healing (such as bruises with different colorations), patterned burn injuries (such as cigarette), patterned lesions suggesting object use (such as shoe or belt), recurrent falls, and multiple injuries (particularly with a symmetrical distribution). Victims may also present with weight loss, muscle wasting, anorexia, malnutrition, disheveled appearance, insomnia, high stress levels, depression, and anxiety.

Certainty assessment

Item 15. Describe any methods used to assess certainty (or confidence) in the body of evidence for an outcome

Explanation: Authors typically use some criteria to decide how certain (or confident) they are in the body of evidence for each important outcome. Common factors considered include precision of the effect estimate (or sample size), consistency of findings across studies, study design limitations and missing results (risk of bias), and how directly the studies address the question. Tools and frameworks can be used to provide a systematic, explicit approach to assessing these factors and provide a common approach and terminology for communicating certainty. For example, using the GRADE approach, authors will first apply criteria to assess each GRADE domain (imprecision, inconsistency, risk of bias, and so forth) and then make an overall judgment of whether the evidence supporting a result is of high, moderate, low, or very low certainty. Reporting the factors considered and the criteria used to assess each factor enables readers to determine which factors fed into reviewers' assessment of certainty. Reporting the process by which assessments were conducted enables readers to assess the potential for errors and facilitates replication.

### Realistic spatial sampling for MEG beamformer images [^330c3801]. Human Brain Mapping (2004). Low credibility.

The spatial resolution achievable using magnetoencephalography (MEG) beamformer techniques is inhomogeneous across the brain and is related directly to the amplitude of the underlying electrical sources [Barnes and Hillebrand, Hum Brain Mapp 2003;18:1–12; Gross et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2001;98:694–699; Van Veen et al. IEEE Trans Biomed Eng 1997;44:867–860; Vrba and Robinson, Proc 12th Int Conf Biomagn 2001]. We set out to examine what an adequate level of spatial sampling of the brain volume is in a realistic situation, and what implications these inhomogeneities have for region-of-interest analysis. As a basis for these calculations, we used a simple retinotopic mapping experiment where stimuli were 17-Hz reversing gratings presented in either left or right visual hemifield. Beamformer weights were calculated based on the covariance of the MEG data in a 0–80 Hz bandwidth. We then estimated volumetric full-width half-maximum (FWHM) maps at a range of sampling levels. We show that approximately 10% of the 1 mm cubic voxels in the occipital volume have a FWHM smoothness of < 5 mm, and 80% < 10 mm in three subjects. This was despite relatively low mean signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) values of 1.5. We demonstrate how visualization of these FWHM maps can be used to avoid some of the pitfalls implicit in beamformer region-of-interest analysis.

Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) — clinical documentation do's and don'ts — "Objective and thorough documentation is extremely important in potential (and actual) child maltreatment circumstances". Recommended practices include: "Document in the medical record the particulars regarding informed consent or permission (ie, who gave it, when it was given, for what purpose, etc)", and "For children able to assent, obtain their assent before proceeding with examination of external genitalia". Clinicians should "Carefully and objectively document any examination limitations or mishaps in the record", "Describe physical findings in detail", and, with consent, "photo-document abnormal genital findings and maintain them in a secure fashion in compliance with privacy rules of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act", noting that "photographs may be reserved for those times when there are concerns that suspected FGM/C constitutes child abuse". Clinicians should "Report impressions objectively, comprehensively, and in as simple language as possible", and when diagnosis is unclear, "it is strongly recommended to consult a health care provider who is well versed in diagnosis of FGM/C in prepubertal or pubertal girls, depending on the case, given that type I and II FGM/C may be difficult to diagnose", with the clarification that "Such consultation is highly recommended before reporting to CPS, especially if the family is amenable". If FGM/C was recently performed, the guidance is to "create the CPS report in a timely fashion, and as soon after evaluation as possible", and to "Document (in reasonable detail), where appropriate, all consultations with colleagues, patients and/or parents, and multidisciplinary partners". Don'ts include not to "Insert language into the record or a report that is inflammatory, superfluous, or highly subjective" and not to "State conclusions that are not supported by specific facts or by the medical literature".

Guideline definitions for key action statements (Table 4) — a strong recommendation is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa) and quality of evidence is excellent or unobtainable", with the implication "Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present". A moderate recommendation is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa) and the quality of evidence is good but not excellent (or is unobtainable)", implying "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a moderate recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences". A weak recommendation (based on low-quality evidence) is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa), but the quality of evidence is weak", with the implication "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a weak recommendation but should remain alert to new information and very sensitive to patient preferences". A weak recommendation (based on balance of benefits and harms) is defined as "Weak recommendation is provided when the aggregate database shows evidence of both benefit and harm that appear to be similar in magnitude for any available courses of action", implying "Clinicians should consider the options in their decision-making, but patient preference may have a substantial role".

### Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses: the PRISMA statement [^2ac62b9f]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Terminology

The terminology used to describe a systematic review and meta-analysis has evolved over time. One reason for changing the name from QUOROM to PRISMA was the desire to encompass both systematic reviews and meta-analyses. We have adopted the definitions used by the Cochrane Collaboration. A systematic review is a review of a clearly formulated question that uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select, and critically appraise relevant research, and to collect and analyse data from the studies that are included in the review. Statistical methods (meta-analysis) may or may not be used to analyse and summarise the results of the included studies. Meta-analysis refers to the use of statistical techniques in a systematic review to integrate the results of included studies.

### CTCF and transcription influence chromatin structure re-configuration after mitosis [^33abc012]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Our data suggest that CTCF influences chromatin structure at several levels during G1 entry. First, CTCF-based structural loops constrain short-range B–B compartmental interactions while promoting local A–A compartmental interactions, revealing a previously underappreciated role for CTCF in chromatin compartmentalization. We speculate that these observations are driven by altered loop extrusion after CTCF loss. Removal of CTCF may allow cohesin to travel beyond CTCF-binding sites, thereby increasing loop sizes. Structural loops originating within A-type compartment domains may thus extend into flanking B-type compartment domains and increase their contact probability (Fig. 6a). The rising gains of B–B interactions during the progression into G1 in the absence of CTCF are consistent with the gradual loading and advancement of cohesin after mitosis. The spatial confinement in B–B interaction gains might be due to limitations of the loop extrusion process. Our findings thus reveal that loop extrusion can elicit both positive and negative effects on compartmentalization depending on the type and location of the compartment (Fig. 6a). Second, the transient nature of many post-mitotic CRE contacts might be explained by the disruptive nature of emerging nearby structural loops. Thus, considering the cell cycle dynamics of structural as well as CRE loops during G1 progression allowed for the inference that CTCF's ability to disrupt established CRE interactions, and hence function as an insulator, requires its engagement in loops (Fig. 6b). Third, we uncovered a previously underappreciated role of the genomic positioning of structural loop relative to CREs. Specifically, CRE contacts were most sensitive to disruption when the structural loop anchor was close to the CRE (small s i -min). While the mechanism underlying this observation is unclear, it is possible that the distance sensitivity of CRE contacts to the disruptive effects of extruding structural loops might be a function of the cohesin complex reaching and being arrested at CTCF sites more frequently. Fourth, CTCF-anchored loops may facilitate interactions between CREs by providing structural support. Weaker CREs appear to be more reliant on such "supportive" structural loops.

### Understanding systematic reviews and meta-analyses [formula: see text] [^a0b57635]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Systematic reviews should be distinguished from narrative reviews. In the latter, an editor asks an expert to sum up all of the information that is known about a particular topic. However, the expert is under no constraints regarding what he or she does, or does not, choose to include in the review. As a result, his or her bias can influence the final message. A systematic review, which may or may not be written by experts, typically asks a narrower question, and then answers it using the entirety of the medical literature. The systematic review process includes computer searches to identify the pertinent literature, a statement of the inclusion and exclusion criteria for identified studies, a list of items of interest to extract from each study, a method to assess the quality of each study, a summary of the evidence that has been found (which may or may not involve attempts to combine data), a discussion of the evidence and the limitations of the conclusions, and suggestions for future research efforts. If the data are combined, that process is called meta-analysis. In meta-analysis, an estimate of the reliability of each study is made, and those that appear to be more reliable are weighed more heavily when the data are combined. While systematic reviews depend on a more preplanned method and thus, unlike narrative reviews, contain sections on method, they can be easily read once the reader becomes familiar with the vocabulary.

### The PRISMA statement for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies that evaluate healthcare interventions: explanation and elaboration [^67a07468]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

A highly structured abstract of a systematic review could include the following headings: Context (or Background); Objective (or Purpose); Data sources; Study selection (or Eligibility criteria); Study appraisal and Synthesis methods (or Data extraction and Data synthesis); Results; Limitations; and Conclusions (or Implications). Alternatively, a simpler structure could cover but collapse some of the above headings (such as label Study selection and Study appraisal as Review methods) or omit some headings such as Background and Limitations.

In the highly structured abstract mentioned above, authors use the Background heading to set the context for readers and explain the importance of the review question. Under the Objectives heading, they ideally use elements of PICOS (see box 2) to state the primary objective of the review. Under a Data sources heading, they summarise sources that were searched, any language or publication type restrictions, and the start and end dates of searches. Study selection statements then ideally describe who selected studies using what inclusion criteria. Data extraction methods statements describe appraisal methods during data abstraction and the methods used to integrate or summarise the data. The Data synthesis section is where the main results of the review are reported. If the review includes meta-analyses, authors should provide numerical results with confidence intervals for the most important outcomes. Ideally, they should specify the amount of evidence in these analyses (numbers of studies and numbers of participants). Under a Limitations heading, authors might describe the most important weaknesses of included studies as well as limitations of the review process. Then authors should provide clear and balanced Conclusions that are closely linked to the objective and findings of the review. Additionally, it would be helpful if authors included some information about funding for the review. Finally, although protocol registration for systematic reviews is still not common practice, if authors have registered their review or received a registration number, we recommend providing the registration information at the end of the abstract.

Taking all the above considerations into account, the intrinsic tension between the goal of completeness of the abstract and its keeping into the space limit often set by journal editors is recognised as a major challenge.

### Language and language disorders: neuroscience to clinical practice [^ff7bc74d]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Language is pivotal to everyday life and to human culture. The flexibility and vast range of possible combinations in human language exceeds the scope of any other system for vocal communication between primates. Disorders of this system are common in everyday neurological practice, typically arising from focal injury to the left hemisphere and also from forms of selective neuronal degeneration. Disorders of language are disabling and cause distress to patients, carers and relatives. The presence of aphasia also creates difficulties in case history taking, assessment and discussion about treatment options and decisions.

Despite being common, language disorders are not always straightforward to evaluate in the clinic or at the bedside. The presentations are varied and there are known pitfalls, such as the mislabelling of fluent aphasia as 'confusion'. There are various schemes to classify language disorders, which create overlapping terminology (eg, the expressive/receptive and fluent/dysfluent divisions of aphasia, see glossary in box 1). Different disciplines have different traditions and approaches to the analysis of language disorders, which further reduces consistency of terminology. Finally, the approach to the language system in medical textbooks remains dominated by Wernicke–Lichtheim's 1874 model of the language system and the notion of canonical aphasia syndromes. This view is outdated and often creates misunderstanding.

Box 1
Glossary

Alexia without agraphia

This is a syndrome characterised by the inability to read with preserved writing. It was conceptualised as a form of disconnection syndrome with a lesion of left primary visual cortex accompanied by a lesion to the splenium of the corpus callosum, cutting off visual input to the angular gyrus and thereby abolishing reading. Writing is intact because left hemisphere language centres remain intact.

Aphasia

The term aphasia, interpreted literally, should mean complete absence of language function. However, this situation is so uncommon in practice that the terms aphasia and dysphasia have come to be used interchangeably. This convention is followed in this article and aphasia has been adopted for consistency. Complete loss of speech output is more likely to be due to anarthria, that is, a motor disorder of articulation not limited to language. In this respect, and in contrast to language, anarthria and dysarthria describe qualitatively different deficits.

### Variation of ventral and incisional hernia repairs in kidney transplant recipients [^3654f98d]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As survivorship following kidney transplant continues to improve, so does the probability of intervening on common surgical conditions, such as ventral or incisional hernia, in this population. Ventral hernia management is known to vary across institutions and this variation has an impact on patient outcomes. We sought to evaluate hospital level variation of ventral or incisional hernia repair (VIHR) in the kidney transplant population.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of 100% inpatient Medicare claims to identify patients who underwent kidney transplant between 2007 and 2018. The primary outcome was 1- and 3-year ventral or incisional risk- and reliability-adjusted VIHR rates. Patient and hospital characteristics were evaluated across risk- and reliability-adjusted VIHR rate tertiles. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race, and Elixhauser comorbidities.

Results

Overall, 139,741 patients underwent kidney transplant during the study period with a mean age (SD) of 51.6 (13.7) years. 84,717 (60.6%) were male, and 72,657 (52.0%) were white. Median follow up time was 5.4 years. 2098 (1.50%) patients underwent VIHR. the 1 year risk- and reliability-adjusted hernia repair rates were 0.49% (95% Conf idence Interval (CI) 0.48–0.51, range 0.31–0.59) in tertile 1, 0.63% (95% CI 0.62–0.63, range 0.59–0.68) in tertile 2, and 0.98 (95% CI 0.91–1.05, range 0.68–2.94) in tertile 3. Accordingly, compared to hospitals in tertile 1, the odds of post-transplant hernia repair tertile 2 hospitals were 1.78 (95% CI 1.37–2.31) and at tertile 3 hospitals 3.53 (95% CI 2.87–4.33).

Conclusions

In a large cohort of Medicare patients undergoing kidney transplant, the overall cumulative incidence of hernia repair varied substantially across hospital tertiles. Patient and hospital characteristics varied across tertile, most notably in diabetes and obesity. Future research is needed to understand if program and surgeon level factors are contributing to the observed variation in treatment of this common disease.

### PRISMA 2020 explanation and elaboration: updated guidance and exemplars for reporting systematic reviews [^0cbeec2c]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Item 23d. Discuss implications of the results for practice, policy, and future research

Explanation: There are many potential end users of a systematic review (such as patients, healthcare providers, researchers, insurers, and policy makers), each of whom will want to know what actions they should take given the review findings. Patients and healthcare providers may be primarily interested in the balance of benefits and harms, while policy makers and administrators may value data on organisational impact and resource utilisation. For reviews of interventions, authors might clarify trade-offs between benefits and harms and how the values attached to the most important outcomes of the review might lead different people to make different decisions. In addition, rather than making recommendations for practice or policy that apply universally, authors might discuss factors that are important in translating the evidence to different settings and factors that may modify the magnitude of effects.

Explicit recommendations for future research — as opposed to general statements such as "More research on this question is needed" — can better direct the questions future studies should address and the methods that should be used. For example, authors might consider describing the type of understudied participants who should be enrolled in future studies, the specific interventions that could be compared, suggested outcome measures to use, and ideal study design features to employ.

The term "obesity paradox" is a figure of speech, not a scientific term. The term has no precise definition and has been used to describe numerous observations that have little in common other than the finding of an association of obesity with a favorable outcome.

Simply labeling counterintuitive findings as the "obesity paradox" adds no value. Unexpected findings should not be viewed negatively; such findings can lead to new knowledge, better treatments, and scientific advances.

### Fibromyalgia and the therapeutic domain. A philosophical study on the origins of fibromyalgia in a specific social setting [^8797ce5e]. Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

Fibromyalgia has always attracted controversy. Wolfe states that fibromyalgia will always exist regardless of the name given to the syndrome. Hadler describes fibromyalgia as a form of illness behaviour escalated by labelling. However, we believe that fibromyalgia, as other functional somatic syndromes, is not waiting below the surface until it becomes manifest by labelling.

Methods

We developed our hypothesis on the relationship between a specific social setting (called the therapeutic domain) and fibromyalgia using empirical philosophical arguments based on Foucault and Hacking. A therapeutic domain is a real and heterogeneous medical domain in which people, their thoughts and practices, and medical technology in any form coexist and communicate. In this domain blood is aspirated, radiographs are taken and classification criteria are made and applied. It is a domain where patient and therapist have initiated a relationship, which is influenced by the media and political pressure. This results in a looping effect where classification criteria and images give structure to perceptions and form the description for human behaviour; the person thus diagnosed (!) constantly has to grow into the conformity of these classification criteria, which also have to be constantly revised. The fibromyalgia concept becomes manifest in an individual as non-specific aches and pains along with other features.

Results

In other times and settings this resulted in analogue syndromes like railway spine, telegraph wrists, neurocirculatory asthenia or perhaps repetitive strain injury. In the application of American College of Rheumatology fibromyalgia classification criteria, labels and medical technology it is possible that invisible experiences manifest themselves in a therapeutic domain. It is not only a phenotype induced by the physician, but in this domain a certain power creates reality making the 'disease' become manifest.

Conclusion

The only certainty in fibromyalgia is that it is still being diagnosed. For prevention and treatment of fibromyalgia, doctors as well as politicians and media have to start by fundamentally changing the therapeutic domain. In such a renewed setting, fibromyalgia cannot become manifest in an individual and thus fibromyalgia syndrome can no longer exist. A firm public message that symptoms can be psychological in origin to prevent their spread, as Wessely recently stated in the comparable case of mass psychogenic illness, is only a part of the answer.

### Radiomics nomograms based on multi-sequence MRI for identifying cognitive impairment and predicting cognitive progression in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis [^2f3b3523]. Academic Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

To build radiomics nomograms based on multi-sequence MRI to facilitate the identification of cognitive impairment (CI) and prediction of cognitive progression (CP) in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively included two RRMS cohorts with multi-sequence MRI and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) data: dataset1 (n = 149, for training and validation) and dataset2 (n = 29, for external validation). 80 patients of dataset1 had a 2-year follow-up SDMT. CI and CP were evaluated using SDMT scores at baseline and follow-up. The included DIR sequence aided in identifying cortical lesions. Lesion radiomics and structural features were extracted and selected from multi-sequence MRI, followed by the computation of radiomics and structural scores. The nomogram was developed through multivariate logistic regression, integrating clinical data, radiomics, and structural scores to identify CI in patients. Moreover, a similar method was employed to further construct a nomogram predicting CP in patients.

Results

The nomogram demonstrated superior performance in identifying patients with CI, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.937 (95% Conf. Interval: 0.898–0.975) and 0.876 (0.810–0.943) in internal and external validation sets, compared to models solely based on clinical data, lesion radiomics, and structural features. Furthermore, another nomogram constructed in predicting CP also exhibited outstanding performance, with an AUC value of 0.969 (0.875–1.000) in the validation set.

Conclusion

These nomograms, integrating clinical data, multi-sequence lesions radiomics, and structural features, enable more effective identification of CI and early prediction of CP in RRMS patients, providing important support for clinical decision-making.

### Brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris) [^4d012d7d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of brentuximab vedotin IV (also known as Adcetris):
- **Anaphylaxis**: use caution in patients with a history of infusion-related reactions.
- **Chronic pulmonary disease**: use caution risk factors for pulmonary toxicity.
- **Colitis**: use caution in patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease.
- **Gastrointestinal perforation, gastrointestinal bleeding**: use caution in patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease or a history of lymphoma with gastrointestinal involvement. Prior to initiating Brentuximab vedotin, assess patients for risk factors of GI complications and consider dose adjustments or alternative treatments if necessary. If serious GI complications like perforation, bleeding, or erosion occur, discontinue Brentuximab vedotin, initiate appropriate medical interventions, and manage the patient's condition.
- **Hematologic disorder**: use caution risk factors for myelosuppression.
- **Hyperglycemia**: use caution pre-existing diabetes mellitus.
- **Increased blood glucose**: use caution in patients with pre-existing diabetes mellitus. Monitor blood glucose levels regularly during Brentuximab vedotin treatment, especially in patients at risk for hyperglycemia, and manage blood sugar levels appropriately. Implement appropriate diabetes management strategies, which may include adjusting medications or insulin dosages under medical supervision.
- **Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia**: use extreme caution with advanced age, a history of hematologic disorder, and who received brentuximab vedotin in combination with chemotherapy. Obtain CBCs prior to each brentuximab dose and more frequently if grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurs; monitor all patients for fever. Therapy interruption, dosage reduction, or discontinuation may be necessary in patients who develop grade 3 or 4 neutropenia.
- **Peripheral neuropathy**: use caution in patients with risk factors for Peripheral neuropathy. Monitor patients for symptoms of neuropathy (e.g., hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, burning sensation, neuropathic pain, or weakness). Therapy interruption, dosage reduction, or discontinuation may be necessary in patients who develop new or worsening peripheral neuropathy.
- **Peripheral neuropathy**: use caution in patients with symptoms of neuropathy.
- **Pneumonitis, ILD, ARDS**: use extreme caution with a history of pulmonary illness or concomitant use of brentuximab with bleomycin-containing chemotherapy. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pulmonary toxicity such as cough and dyspnea. Evaluate patients who develop new or worsening pulmonary symptoms; hold brentuximab until symptoms improve. Most cases resolved following corticosteroid treatment.
- **Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy**: use extreme caution in patients with prior immunosuppressive therapies or immunosuppressive disease. Evaluate patients who develop new neurological, cognitive, or behavioral signs and symptoms such as changes in mood or behavior; confusion; memory impairment; changes in vision, speech, or walking. Hold therapy if PML is suspected; discontinue brentuximab in patients with confirmed PML.
- **Tumor lysis syndrome**: use extreme caution in patients with rapidly proliferating tumors and/or a high tumor burden. Monitor patients for signs of TLS (e.g., serum electrolytes, uric acid, serum creatinine) prior to and during therapy. Institute appropriate prophylactic and treatment (e.g., hydration, uric acid lowering therapy) as necessary.

Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) evidence quality assessment — Under GRADE, the quality of evidence is influenced by "study design, risk of bias, consistency, precision, directness, and publication bias", with randomized trials "presumed to be high in quality, unless compromised", and observational studies "considered to be low in quality by default but can be 'rated up' by demonstrating a large magnitude of effect, a dose–response, or results that would be even more compelling if plausible confounders are taken into account". Table factors for rating down include "Risk of bias", "Heterogeneity", "Imprecision", "Indirectness", and "Publication bias", and for rating up include "Magnitude of effect", "Dose–response", and "Plausible confounding effect", with example comments such as "Unclear allocation concealment, incomplete blinding, selective reporting of results, incomplete accounting of outcomes", "Inconsistent results across studies", "Confidence intervals range from substantial benefit to little or no benefit", and "Studies showing negative or conflicting results may exist but are missing from the literature".

Stage 2: concept analysis

The second aim of this study, to generate a working definition of the preconception population and associated attributes, was achieved via concept analysis. A concept analysis provides guidance in understanding a concept of interest that is vaguely defined or poorly understood. It involves the dissection of a concept into simpler elements to promote clarity and understanding and can help elucidate its meaning or definition. Our concept analysis of the term "preconception population" was guided by the eight-step method described by Walker and Avant, which included selecting a concept, determining the aims of the analysis, identifying possible uses of the concept, determining the defining attributes, identifying model cases, identifying additional cases, identifying antecedents and consequences, and defining empirical referents. Descriptions of these steps are outlined in Table 1.

### Committee opinion no. 676: health literacy to promote quality of care [^3ff543f0]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Health literacy — developing written materials for patients — Develop written materials, keep the messages simple, and limit the number of messages (the general guideline is four main messages). Focus on action with specific recommendations based on behavior (eg, "Take a warm-water bath two times a day"). Use the active voice instead of the passive voice, use familiar language and avoid jargon, and use visual aids, such as drawings or models, for key points. Use at least a 12-point type size to make the messages easy to read and leave plenty of white space around margins and between sections.
