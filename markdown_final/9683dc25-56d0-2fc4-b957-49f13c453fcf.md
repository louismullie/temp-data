## Question

Right hip pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating right hip pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial triage and red flags. Then, I should verify the key elements of history that narrow the differential. Next, I will examine the physical exam maneuvers and their diagnostic utility. After that, I need to check the imaging strategy and when to escalate to CT or MRI. Then, I will construct a prioritized differential by age and pain location, including referred and systemic causes. Finally, I will outline management pathways and highlight pitfalls and special populations, ensuring each step is supported by appropriate references.

> Let me first confirm the red flags and immediate priorities, because missing fracture, infection, or malignancy has major consequences. In acute trauma or fall with inability to bear weight, I should suspect fracture and obtain AP pelvis and cross-table lateral hip radiographs urgently, recognizing that physical exam alone cannot reliably exclude fracture and that MRI or CT is indicated if radiographs are negative but suspicion remains high [^87ea9e27] [^a3521f77] [^62e4e925]. For fever, systemic illness, or markedly elevated inflammatory markers, I need to consider septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, or pelvic infection and proceed with urgent labs and joint aspiration if indicated, as delays worsen outcomes [^notfound]. For older adults with new hip pain, I should maintain a high index for occult fracture even after minor trauma, and for adolescents, I must not miss slipped capital femoral epiphysis or osteoid osteoma, which can masquerade as routine hip pain [^62e4e925] [^fc7edfba].

> Next, I should review the history elements that most efficiently refine the differential. Age is pivotal: in adults over 50, osteoarthritis predominates; in young adults, femoroacetabular impingement and labral tears are common; in adolescents, apophyseal avulsions and SCFE are key; in children, transient synovitis and septic arthritis lead the list, so I need to tailor pretest probabilities accordingly [^65ce6ee1] [^f368efd2] [^75e5b1ca]. Pain location matters: anterior groin pain suggests intra-articular pathology, lateral pain points to greater trochanteric pain syndrome, and posterior buttock pain suggests lumbar or sacroiliac referral or deep gluteal syndrome, so I should map the pain carefully before attributing it to the hip joint itself [^a844b507] [^65ce6ee1]. Onset and tempo guide urgency: acute post-traumatic pain raises fracture or dislocation, insidious pain suggests degenerative or overuse etiologies, and nocturnal pain or weight loss should trigger concern for malignancy or infection, prompting expedited imaging and labs [^65ce6ee1] [^a844b507].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the exam. I need to check which maneuvers actually shift probability. For suspected osteoarthritis, decreased passive internal rotation and adduction, pain with squat, and abductor weakness increase the likelihood of radiographic OA, whereas normal passive adduction makes OA less likely, so I should document these explicitly and correlate with radiographs when appropriate [^77d2b510]. For femoroacetabular impingement, the FADIR test is sensitive but not specific, so a positive test supports the diagnosis when aligned with history and imaging, but I should not overcall it in isolation [^d8f0e7b3]. For lateral hip pain, I should palpate the greater trochanter and perform resisted abduction to screen for gluteus medius tendinopathy or tear, and consider ultrasound-guided injection for both diagnosis and treatment if uncertainty persists [^842f3598]. For posterior pain, I should assess for lumbar radiculopathy, sacroiliac joint tenderness, and perform the long-stride test if ischiofemoral impingement is suspected, remembering that dual pathology is common and may require staged management [^296252ce] [^4d411868].

> I will now examine the imaging strategy, and I need to ensure I align with appropriateness criteria. In acute pain with trauma or suspected fracture, start with AP pelvis and cross-table lateral hip radiographs; if negative but suspicion remains, proceed to MRI or CT without delay to avoid missing occult fractures or dislocations, especially in older adults [^a3521f77] [^62e4e925]. In chronic hip pain, begin with AP pelvis and lateral femoral head-neck radiographs to evaluate for OA, dysplasia, and impingement morphology; escalate to MRI or MR arthrography for suspected labral tears, osteonecrosis, or soft-tissue pathology, and consider ultrasound for bursal or tendinous lesions or for guided injections [^51b82cac] [^a844b507]. Wait, let me verify the role of CT: CT is particularly helpful for complex bony anatomy, peri-prosthetic issues, or when MRI is contraindicated, so I should reserve it for those scenarios rather than using it routinely [^notfound].

> Let me think about the differential by age and location, and I should double-check that I am not overlooking referred sources. In adults over 50, osteoarthritis is most common, but I must also consider fracture, osteonecrosis, and malignancy; in adults 18–50, femoroacetabular impingement, labral tears, dysplasia, and microinstability predominate; in adolescents, SCFE, apophyseal avulsions, and osteoid osteoma are key; in children, transient synovitis and septic arthritis are priorities, with inflammatory arthritides and Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease also on the list [^65ce6ee1] [^f368efd2] [^75e5b1ca]. But wait, what if the pain is referred? Retroperitoneal or pelvic pathology, lumbar radiculopathy, and sacroiliac joint disease can all present as hip pain, so I should screen the spine and abdomen when the clinical picture does not fit a primary hip disorder [^a844b507] [^296252ce].

> I should confirm the management pathways next, and I need to ensure they match the diagnosis and severity. For osteoarthritis, core treatments include patient education, weight loss if overweight, exercise therapy, and analgesics; intra-articular corticosteroid injections can provide short-term relief, and surgical referral is reasonable for persistent pain with advanced radiographic disease or functional limitation [^3f0d9335]. For femoroacetabular impingement and labral tears, a trial of conservative care is appropriate, but persistent symptoms despite rehabilitation warrant referral for arthroscopic evaluation, which has favorable outcomes in appropriately selected patients [^65ce6ee1]. For greater trochanteric pain syndrome, targeted physical therapy, activity modification, and ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection are effective, with surgery reserved for refractory cases with confirmed abductor tears [^842f3598]. For suspected infection, urgent orthopedic consultation, joint aspiration, and empiric antibiotics are critical; for fracture or dislocation, immediate immobilization and orthopedic involvement are mandatory to prevent complications such as osteonecrosis [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify common pitfalls so I do not repeat them. Missing occult fracture after a fall is frequent when relying on exam alone; obtaining radiographs and escalating to MRI or CT when suspicion persists prevents delays in fixation and reduces morbidity [^62e4e925]. Misattributing posterior hip pain to the hip when the source is lumbar or sacroiliac leads to failed hip interventions; a careful spine and SI exam, and selective injections, can clarify the pain generator and guide sequencing of care [^296252ce]. Overlooking atypical causes such as osteoid osteoma in adolescents, psoas abscess, or retroperitoneal tumors can prolong suffering; maintaining a broad differential and using MRI when the story does not fit standard patterns helps catch these entities earlier [^fc7edfba] [^a42bcbcc] [^e6ff6505].

> Let me reconsider special populations and contexts so I do not miss nuances. In patients with HIV or other immunocompromised states, avascular necrosis and opportunistic infections rise on the list, so I should have a lower threshold for advanced imaging and specialist input when pain is disproportionate or persistent [^57d23c5f]. In pregnancy and postpartum patients, transient osteoporosis and fragility fractures can occur; MRI is the modality of choice when plain films are unrevealing but symptoms persist, to avoid delays in diagnosis and treatment [^c6ae3b9b]. In children, differentiating septic arthritis from transient synovitis using clinical prediction tools and inflammatory markers guides the need for aspiration, and awareness of osteoarticular tuberculosis is essential in the right epidemiologic context [^notfound] [^29c481e9].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, stepwise approach: screen for red flags, localize pain by history, prioritize the differential by age and location, perform targeted physical exam maneuvers with known likelihoods, and apply imaging algorithms that start with radiographs and escalate to MRI or CT when indicated. Aligning management with the confirmed diagnosis and avoiding premature closure reduces misdiagnosis and improves outcomes, and I should double-check each step against the clinical evidence base to keep the reasoning sound [^65ce6ee1] [^51b82cac] [^77d2b510].

Right hip pain has a broad differential, but the most common causes are **osteoarthritis** [^3f0d9335], **femoroacetabular impingement** [^f368efd2], and **greater trochanteric pain syndrome** [^b9e201a6]. Start with a focused history and exam to localize pain and identify red flags, then use **plain radiographs** as first-line imaging [^51b82cac]; MRI is reserved for persistent or unclear cases [^a844b507]. Management is diagnosis-specific: conservative care for most, with surgery for refractory cases or structural lesions [^65ce6ee1].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of right hip pain is broad and can be categorized into **intra-articular, extra-articular, and referred pain** sources [^a844b507]:

| **Category** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|
| Intra-articular | - Osteoarthritis [^3f0d9335] <br/> - Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) [^f368efd2] <br/> - Labral tears [^2083eaeb] <br/> - Avascular necrosis [^a9b2ce95] <br/> - Rheumatoid arthritis [^aa2006ac] <br/> - Septic arthritis [^notfound] |
| Extra-articular | - Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) [^b9e201a6] <br/> - Hip bursitis <br/> - Gluteal tendinopathy [^842f3598] <br/> - Piriformis syndrome [^4d411868] <br/> - Ischiofemoral impingement [^4d411868] |
| Referred pain | - Lumbar radiculopathy [^296252ce] <br/> - Sacroiliac joint dysfunction [^4d411868] <br/> - Pelvic pathology (e.g. psoas abscess, obturator hernia) [^a42bcbcc] [^6a05dac8] |

## Clinical evaluation

### History

A thorough history should include:

- **Pain characteristics**: onset, duration, location (anterior groin, lateral, posterior), intensity, aggravating and relieving factors [^a844b507].
- **Associated symptoms**: stiffness, swelling, fever, weight loss, night pain, mechanical symptoms (locking, clicking) [^65ce6ee1].
- **Functional impact**: difficulty with walking, climbing stairs, weight-bearing [^3f0d9335].
- **Medical history**: trauma, chronic diseases, medications, alcohol use, smoking, family history of arthritis or hip disorders [^3f0d9335].

---

### Physical examination

The physical examination should include:

- **Inspection**: gait analysis, deformities, leg length discrepancy [^a844b507].
- **Palpation**: tenderness over the greater trochanter, iliopsoas, sacroiliac joint [^4d411868].
- **Range of motion**: limited internal rotation and flexion suggest osteoarthritis; pain with FADIR suggests FAI [^d8f0e7b3].
- **Special tests**: FABER, FADIR, Trendelenburg sign, straight leg raise [^64ae64a1].

---

## Diagnostic imaging

Imaging is essential for confirming the diagnosis and guiding management:

- **Plain radiographs**: First-line for suspected osteoarthritis, fracture, dysplasia, or FAI [^51b82cac].
- **MRI**: Indicated for suspected soft tissue pathology (labral tears, bursitis, tendinopathy, avascular necrosis) or when radiographs are inconclusive [^a844b507].
- **CT**: Useful for detailed bony assessment, particularly in complex fractures or surgical planning [^d401edaf].
- **Ultrasound**: Helpful for evaluating bursitis, tendinopathy, and guiding injections [^b9e201a6].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying diagnosis**:

- **Osteoarthritis**: Conservative management includes weight loss, physical therapy, analgesics, and intra-articular corticosteroid injections. Total hip arthroplasty is indicated for advanced disease refractory to conservative treatment [^3f0d9335].
- **Femoroacetabular impingement**: Conservative management with activity modification and physical therapy. Arthroscopic surgery is considered for persistent symptoms or structural lesions [^4b47fa2c].
- **Greater trochanteric pain syndrome**: Conservative management with NSAIDs, physical therapy, and corticosteroid injections. Surgery is rarely indicated [^notfound].
- **Avascular necrosis**: Early stages managed conservatively; advanced disease may require core decompression or joint replacement [^notfound].
- **Septic arthritis**: Emergent joint drainage and antibiotic therapy [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis varies by diagnosis and treatment. Osteoarthritis can cause significant disability if untreated [^3f0d9335], whereas **early intervention** improves outcomes in FAI and labral tears [^notfound]. Complications include chronic pain, reduced mobility, joint degeneration, and permanent disability [^notfound].

---

Right hip pain requires a **structured approach**: history, exam, and imaging to identify the cause, followed by targeted therapy. Most patients improve with conservative care, but some need surgery; early, accurate diagnosis is key to preventing chronic pain and disability [^65ce6ee1].

### Management of hip pain in young adults [^7b81bf03]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and treatment of hip pain in the young adult remains a challenge. Recently, understanding of a few specific hip conditions has improved; most notably femoroacetabular impingement. The differential diagnosis of hip pain has also expanded significantly, offering new challenges and opportunities. Along with the diagnostic dilemma, optimal treatment strategies for many conditions have yet to be proven and are current areas of important inquiry. This article reviews the current research on hip pain in the young adult and presents an overview of diagnostic and management strategies.

### Acute hip pain: mimics of a femoral neck fracture [^b0957147]. Clinical Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Acute hip pain is a common presenting complaint among patients attending Emergency Departments particularly following a traumatic event. A proximal femoral fracture is the main consideration, which requires urgent confirmation and treatment; however, there are a number of conditions, which could mimic neck of femur fracture and the causes may not be directly related to the hip, so systematic and careful observation of pelvic MRI could shed light on the true culprit of acute hip pain.

### Not your usual hip pain: necrotising fasciitis secondary to sigmoid perforation [^a22b41a0]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Necrotising fasciitis (NF) resulting from sigmoid perforation is rare, but none the less remains life threatening. Early surgical intervention and empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic remains the standard of care. A 65-year-old man with history of stage 4 rectal cancer presented with bilateral hip pain. An X-ray of the hip and pelvis to rule out fracture revealed abnormal gas pattern overlying the right hip. CT imaging revealed distal sigmoid perforation with air extending from the pelvis to posterior aspect of the right hip and thigh. Aggressive surgical intervention and antibiotic initiation was associated with successful outcomes in our patient. Although less common, sigmoid perforation leading to NF in posterior thigh is a reminder of a potentially lethal complication.

### The young adult with hip pain: diagnosis and medical treatment, circa 2004 [^aa2006ac]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2004). Low credibility.

Hip pain in young adults (18–35 years old) often is characterized by nonspecific symptoms, normal imaging studies, and vague findings from the history and physical examination. In younger patients, pain is more likely to be caused by congenital hip dysplasia, athletic injuries, trauma, spondyloarthropathy, and by conditions that first appear during this stage of life, such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, intravenous drug use, alcoholism, or corticosteroid use. The history and physical examination may narrow the diagnosis to intraarticular, extraarticular, or referred sources of pain. Plain radiography and magnetic resonance imaging are the preferred initial imaging procedures. Analyses of the blood, urine, and synovial fluid can be helpful in diagnosing inflammation, infection, and systematic rheumatic disease. Fractures, infection, and ischemic necrosis should be ruled out early because they require immediate treatment to prevent damage to the joint. Hip trauma at a young age increases the risk of osteoarthritis with advancing age, and, unlike most older adults, young adults receiving total hip replacement can expect revision surgery. Medical treatment often involves patient education, physical therapy, and pharmacotherapy. Acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and opioids for pain and antibiotics for infection are the most often prescribed drugs for this population.

### Unilateral avascular necrosis of the right hip in an HIV patient with tearing of the rectus femoris and adductor longus muscles [^57d23c5f]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Several differential diagnoses should be considered in this patient. The most likely differential diagnosis is avascular necrosis given the join pain, instability, altered gait, limited range of motion and the radiographic findings confirming the diagnosis. Next, infectious arthritis and osteomyelitis are plausible given the immunocompromised state associated with HIV and a sexually transmitted disease history. This is not supported by the lack of typical signs of an acute joint infection such as fever, severe pain, erythema and other systemic symptoms. Another possible diagnosis is traumatic avascular necrosis due to the high forces required for a hip dislocation as well as the haematoma. This is not supported by the absence of a clear traumatic event in the patient's history. The least likely diagnosis would be HIV-associated polymyositis which is less likely as it presents with symmetric and proximal muscle weakness rather than the unilateral and unifocal involvement observed in this case.

### Buttock pain: a missed diagnosis [^52cb0a5c]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

A 13-year-old school boy presented with right-sided buttock pain, features of sepsis and Staphylococcus aureus positive blood cultures. On examination, he was febrile and in severe pain, with limited hip rotation and positive sacroiliac stress tests. Initial imaging with pelvic x-ray, hip ultrasound and MRI were normal. Despite this, a diagnosis of septic arthritis of the hip was presumed, and the patient underwent a washout of the right hip. When the imaging was reviewed in more detail, it was noted that a section of the sacroiliac joint was abnormal. Subsequent pelvic MRI confirmed that this was, in fact, septic sacroiliitis. The patient made a good recovery following washout of the right sacroiliac joint and 6 weeks of antibiotics.

### Editorial commentary: the importance of developing an algorithm when diagnosing hip pain [^4ab6e720]. Arthroscopy (2016). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of groin pain is broad and complex. Therefore, it is essential to develop an algorithm when differentiating the hip as a cause of groin pain from other sources. Selective injections in and around the hip can be helpful when making the diagnosis but are only one part of the algorithm.

### Unilateral infective sacroiliitis in a boy presenting with a limp [^6034f659]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 9-year-old boy admitted to a district general hospital with a 1-week history of fever and a 2-day history of right hip pain. Initial workup revealed raised inflammatory markers and unremarkable imaging studies. After clinical review, there was minimal improvement of the patient's condition 5days after presentation; therefore, an MRI of the pelvis/hips was carried out, which supported a clinical diagnosis of right-sided infective sacroiliitis. Infective sacroiliitis is rare and only represents 1%-2% of septic arthritis in children. The condition still remains a diagnostic challenge first due to poor localisation of symptoms with referred pain to the hip, thigh and lower back and second due to a lack of awareness by non-specialist clinicians. Early diagnosis is a key to avoid sequelae such as an abscess, degenerative changes of the sacroiliac joint and can be achieved by a thorough clinical examination, monitoring inflammatory markers and MRI.

### Unique cause of chronic right hip pain and unilateral leg swelling 10 yrs following total hip arthroplasty [^0142767d]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Patient is a 64-yr-old female with a history of right total hip arthroplasty who presented with progressive, painful right lower extremity edema and chronic groin pain for 2 years. A computed tomography scan from October 2021 revealed an expanding, large iliopsoas bursal fluid collection that caused compression of the right common femoral artery and vein in June 2023. Further workup excluded deep venous thrombosis or infectious causes. Iliopsoas fluid collections can result from various conditions such as a rare complication of total hip arthroplasty. This is likely due to mechanical irritation from the prosthetic components and was confirmed with resolution of symptoms after undergoing revision of total hip arthroplasty in 2024. This case highlights iliopsoas hematoma as a rare but important consideration in patients with unilateral lower extremity edema after total hip arthroplasty.

### Unilateral avascular necrosis of the right hip in an HIV patient with tearing of the rectus femoris and adductor longus muscles [^a2c0233c]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Case presentation

A man in his 20s with a medical history of syphilis, chlamydia and HIV presented to the emergency department (ED) with 2 months of right hip pain that had progressively worsened within the last month. Initially, 2 months ago, he sought outpatient care from a nurse practitioner when the pain started. After the negative lumbar X-rays (XRs), the pain initially was attributed to sciatica. There were no physical examination findings available from the initial visit. The pain continued to worsen after failing lidocaine patches and rest, eventually rendering the patient unable to ambulate. Two months later, a CT lumbar spine was ordered, which demonstrated right femoral head dislocation, erosive changes in the femoral head and acetabulum, as well as a large hip joint effusion. This prompted the patient's visit to the ED the same day, where a physical examination revealed that the right lower extremity was shortened and externally rotated, consistent with the known deformity of the right hip. Sensation and vibratory sense were intact bilaterally as well as dorsalis pedis pulses. A hip examination performed in the ED revealed no active range of motion of the right hip. Passive range of motion to 45 degrees with flexion and abduction of the right hip was possible with pain past 45 degrees and pain with any internal rotation of the right hip. An MRI of the right hip was ordered, with findings raising concern for a superimposed septic arthritis and osteomyelitis.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® chronic hip pain: 2022 update [^51b82cac]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic hip pain is a frequent chief complaint for adult patients who present for evaluation in a variety of clinical practice settings. Following a targeted history and physical examination, imaging plays a vital role in elucidating the etiologies of a patient's symptoms, as a wide spectrum of pathological entities may cause chronic hip pain. Radiography is usually the appropriate initial imaging test following a clinical examination. Depending on the clinical picture, advanced cross-sectional imaging may be subsequently performed for further evaluation. This documents provides best practice for the imaging workup of chronic hip pain in patients presenting with a variety of clinical scenarios. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Bilateral transient osteoporosis of the hip in a 20-year-old man [^f7fd7d55]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Transient osteoporosis is a rare musculoskeletal condition that has been reported in pregnant women and middle-aged men. We present a bilateral case in a young man. A 20-year-old man presented with spontaneous onset left hip pain. Investigations excluded other differential diagnoses such as infection or fracture. The pain resolved completely; 6 months later the patient presented with a similar episode of pain in the contralateral hip. This also resolved spontaneously. Doctors need to be aware of the possibility of spontaneous onset musculoskeletal pain due to transient osteoporosis occurring in young men. The typical presentation is of spontaneous onset progressive pain, often affecting the hip. Other pathology must be excluded. The investigation of choice is MRI, and the treatment is simple analgesia.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism: an uncommon cause of hip pain [^e96e49de]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

Hip pain is a common complaint in a pediatric emergency department. The causes of hip pain are diverse and generally include traumatic and infectious causes. We report a case of hip pain caused by deep soft tissue infection associated with hypercalcemia and primary hyperparathyroidism. Atypical presentation of primary hyperparathyroidism may result in a delay in diagnosis.

### Pathogenesis and contemporary diagnoses for lateral hip pain: a scoping review [^9743886f]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Lateral hip pain used to be a poorly defined entity, but advances in imaging and interest in sports medicine have led to a better understanding of the pathology, presentation and management of this cohort of patients. A thorough appreciation of the anatomy of the abductor musculature, specific clinical signs and imaging findings will lead to an appropriate diagnosis being made and management plan instituted. Finally, it should be noted that assessment of baseline psychological impairment is essential in this group of patients to optimise outcomes.

### Differentiating hip pathology from lumbar spine pathology: key points of evaluation and management [^296252ce]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and treatment of patients who have both hip and lumbar spine pathologies may be a challenge because overlapping symptoms may delay a correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Common complaints of patients who have both hip and lumbar spine pathologies include low back pain with associated buttock, groin, thigh, and, possibly, knee pain. A thorough patient history should be obtained and a complete physical examination should be performed in these patients to identify the primary source of pain. Plain and advanced imaging studies and diagnostic injections can be used to further delineate the primary pathology and guide the appropriate sequence of treatment. Both the surgeon and the patient should understand that, although one pathology is managed, the management of the other pathology may be necessary because of persistent pain. The recognition of both entities may help reduce the likelihood of misdiagnosis, and the management of both entities in the appropriate sequence may help reduce the likelihood of persistent symptoms.

### An obscure cause of hip pain [^6a05dac8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

We describe the case of a 53-year-old woman with hip pain secondary to an obturator hernia. Obturator hernia is uncommon, and the most lethal of all abdominal hernias. The high mortality rate of this disease requires an acute clinical awareness to facilitate rapid diagnosis and surgical intervention for improved prognosis.

Objectives

This case highlights a vitally important diagnosis that is rarely discussed in the emergency medicine literature.

Case Report

Our patient presented without symptoms typical of a bowel obstruction, although a computed tomography scan of her pelvis revealed an incarcerated obturator hernia and a small bowel obstruction.

Conclusions

Early diagnosis and expeditious surgical management resulted in a good outcome.

### Does this patient have hip osteoarthritis? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^77d2b510]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hip osteoarthritis (OA) is a common cause of pain and disability.

Objective

To identify the clinical findings that are most strongly associated with hip OA.

Data Sources

Systematic search of MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL from inception until November 2019.

Study Selection

Included studies (1) quantified the accuracy of clinical findings (history, physical examination, or simple tests) and (2) used plain radiographs as the reference standard for diagnosing hip OA.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Studies were assigned levels of evidence using the Rational Clinical Examination scale and assessed for risk of bias using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool. Data were extracted using individual hips as the unit of analysis and only pooled when findings were reported in 3 or more studies.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs).

Results

Six studies were included, with data from 1110 patients and 1324 hips, of which 509 (38%) showed radiographic evidence of OA. Among patients presenting to primary care physicians with hip or groin pain, the affected hip showed radiographic evidence of OA in 34% of cases. A family history of OA, personal history of knee OA, or pain on climbing stairs or walking up slopes all had LRs of 2.1 (sensitivity range, 33%-68%; specificity range, 68%-84%; broadest LR range: 95% CI, 1.1–3.8). To identify patients most likely to have OA, the most useful findings were squat causing posterior pain (sensitivity, 24%; specificity, 96%; LR, 6.1 [95% CI, 1.3–29]), groin pain on passive abduction or adduction (sensitivity, 33%; specificity, 94%; LR, 5.7 [95% CI, 1.6–20]), abductor weakness (sensitivity, 44%; specificity, 90%; LR, 4.5 [95% CI, 2.4–8.4]), and decreased passive hip adduction (sensitivity, 80%; specificity, 81%; LR, 4.2 [95% CI, 3.0–6.0]) or internal rotation (sensitivity, 66%; specificity, 79%; LR, 3.2 [95% CI, 1.7–6.0]) as measured by a goniometer or compared with the contralateral leg. The presence of normal passive hip adduction was most useful for suggesting the absence of OA (negative LR, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.11–0.54]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Simple tests of hip motion and observing for pain during that motion were helpful in distinguishing patients most likely to have OA on plain radiography from those who will not. A combination of findings efficiently detects those most likely to have severe hip OA.

### Evaluation of the patient with hip pain [^a844b507]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Hip pain is a common and disabling condition that affects patients of all ages. The differential diagnosis of hip pain is broad, presenting a diagnostic challenge. Patients often express that their hip pain is localized to one of three anatomic regions: the anterior hip and groin, the posterior hip and buttock, or the lateral hip. Anterior hip and groin pain is commonly associated with intra-articular pathology, such as osteoarthritis and hip labral tears. Posterior hip pain is associated with piriformis syndrome, sacroiliac joint dysfunction, lumbar radiculopathy, and less commonly ischiofemoral impingement and vascular claudication. Lateral hip pain occurs with greater trochanteric pain syndrome. Clinical examination tests, although helpful, are not highly sensitive or specific for most diagnoses; however, a rational approach to the hip examination can be used. Radiography should be performed if acute fracture, dislocations, or stress fractures are suspected. Initial plain radiography of the hip should include an anteroposterior view of the pelvis and frog-leg lateral view of the symptomatic hip. Magnetic resonance imaging should be performed if the history and plain radiograph results are not diagnostic. Magnetic resonance imaging is valuable for the detection of occult traumatic fractures, stress fractures, and osteonecrosis of the femoral head. Magnetic resonance arthrography is the diagnostic test of choice for labral tears.

### Uncommon presentation of a common condition: an easily missed cause of hip pain [^a42bcbcc]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Conventionally, patients presenting with hip pain and restricted mobility to accident and emergency (A&E) department are thought to have musculoskeletal pain. Occasionally, patients with significant abdominal pathology can present with hip pain. Such atypical presentation causes the delayed diagnosis leading to significant morbidity and possible mortality. We report a 63-year-old man who had been treated in A&E on numerous occasions with left hip pain for over 6 weeks. On this occasion, he had been brought in septic shock. On examination, he had subcutaneous emphysema of left lower limb. A CT scan showed a large psoas abscess resulting from retroperitoneal perforation of sigmoid diverticulitis tracking into his left lower limb. He underwent a Hartmann's procedure and drainage of his intra-abdominal sepsis. The thigh was not drained with separate incisions at the index operation. Residual thigh abscess was managed by image-guided drainage.

Introductory case 1

An 8 year old boy, previously healthy, presented to the rheumatology clinic with a three week history of right hip pain and one week history of pain in the right knee, without fever. He was diagnosed with streptoccocal tonsilitis one month ago. For his joint complaints he was treated with acetylsalicylic acid for three weeks, with minimal improvement. There was no past personal or family history of arthritis.

On examination, arthritis was found in both the right hip and the right knee. There was no evidence of erythema marginatum, chorea, subcutaneous nodules or cardiac murmurs. The complete blood count was normal, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 40 mm/hr and antistreptolysin O (ASLO) level was 700 IU/mL. The echocardiogram was normal.

### Abstract… [^4b47fa2c]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

Diagnostic Testing Radiography should be performed in patients in whom the history and physical examination are consistent with FAI. An anteroposterior view of the pelvis evaluates the hips for osteoarthritis; the acetabulum for dysplasia, overhang, or retroversion; the femoral head for osteonecrosis or remodeling; the sacroiliac joints for arthritis; and the lower lumbar spine. Because standard AP and lateral views of the hip can miss important abnormalities in patients with FAI, modified Dunn view radiography, in which the hip is flexed 90 degrees and abducted 20 degrees. One retrospective study found that intra-articular injection of the hip with bupivacaine during magnetic resonance arthrography has 92 percent sensitivity, 97 percent specificity, and 90 percent accuracy for diagnosis of an intra-articular disorder. 14 The absence of pain relief with the injection suggests an extra-articular source of pain, which theoretically rules out FAI.

15 However, the anesthetic will not relieve pain in some patients because contrast media can irritate the joint. In these patients, a separate diagnostic injection with bupivacaine can be done. Management There are no published studies of nonsurgical treatment of FAI. Because FAI is typically symptomatic with activities of daily living, recommending rest from exercise is not likely to be beneficial. Analgesics have a limited role, and a trial of physical therapy is prudent. Treatment goals are to improve hip muscle flexibility and strength, posture, and other muscle or joint deficits identified in the physical examination. Patients with refractory cases should be referred to an orthopedic sub-specialist for consideration of arthroscopy. The goals of arthroscopy are to alleviate impingement, to repair or remove injured tissue, and to prevent or delay osteoarthritis. To alleviate impingement, pincer and cam lesions are removed and femoral offset is corrected, restoring bony alignment.

Risks of surgery include neurovascular injury, infection, deep venous thrombosis, and heterotopic bone formation. Theoretic risks unique to arthroscopic treatment of FAI are femoral neck fracture and avascular necrosis of the femoral head, but few cases have been reported. It is hypothesized that arthroscopic treatment of FAI can prevent or delay the onset or progression of osteoarthritis of the hip, but this has yet to be demonstrated with long-term clinical follow-up.

### Hip pain in adults: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^65ce6ee1]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Adults commonly present to their family physicians with hip pain, and diagnosing the cause is important for prescribing effective therapy. Hip pain is usually located anteriorly, laterally, or posteriorly. Anterior hip pain includes referred pain from intra-abdominal or intrapelvic causes; extra-articular etiologies, such as hip flexor injuries; and intra-articular etiologies. Intra-articular pain is often caused by a labral tear or femoroacetabular impingement in younger adults or osteoarthritis in older adults. Lateral hip pain is most commonly caused by greater trochanteric pain syndrome, which includes gluteus medius tendinopathy or tear, bursitis, and iliotibial band friction. Posterior hip pain includes referred pain such as lumbar spinal pathology, deep gluteal syndrome with sciatic nerve entrapment, ischiofemoral impingement, and hamstring tendinopathy. In addition to the history and physical examination, radiography, ultrasonography, or magnetic resonance imaging may be needed for a definitive diagnosis. Radiography of the hip and pelvis should be the initial imaging test. Ultrasound-guided anesthetic injections can aid in the diagnosis of an intra-articular cause of pain. Because femoroacetabular impingement, labral tears, and gluteus medius tendon tears typically have good surgical outcomes, advanced imaging and/or early referral may improve patient outcomes.

A 52-year-old man underwent bilateral articular surface replacement (ASR) DePuy in June 2006. Following a right femoral neck fracture 4 days postoperatively, he underwent revision to a cemented C-stem DePuy, a taper sleeve adaptor and a 47 mm diameter cobalt chromium femoral head. The patient recovered well with satisfactory 5-year follow-up. In September 2011 the patient presented to the accident and emergency department with a 5-day history of feeling unwell with right lower quadrant pain. Examination of the right hip was unremarkable apart from painful adduction. Blood tests showed raised inflammatory markers and white cell count. MRI scan showed a right iliopsoas collection which appeared to communicate with the hip joint. The patient underwent a direct exchange of the right hip prosthesis. The intraoperative clinical picture was suggestive of atypical lymphocytic vasculitis and associated lesions. The patient recovered well and was discharged home. At his last clinic visit he was well and pain free.

### Ewing's sarcoma of the pelvis: an unusual, but not to be missed, cause of an irritable hip [^1828297b]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

A 15-year-old girl presented with a 2-month history of non-specific right hip pain associated with pain in the back, right flank and foot. Her symptoms deteriorated, interfering with weight-bearing. Following admission, she was found to be febrile with a flexion deformity of her right-hip, and tenderness over the iliac crest and posterior pelvis. A markedly elevated C reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, with an ultrasound-proven scan effusion within the right hip were all suggestive of septic arthritis. However, full blood count demonstrated a significant anaemia, which together with the tenderness around the pelvis was not in keeping with this diagnosis. Surgical washout was therefore delayed to obtain a MRI scan of the pelvis. The scan revealed a 5×5×3cm necrotic soft tissue mass within the gluteal muscles, arising from the right ilium, which biopsy confirmed to be a Ewing's sarcoma.

The patient also had low-grade fever, cough and decreased appetite. The patient was undocumented and had recently moved from Myanmar. He was thin, in moderate distress with bilateral lung rhonchi, mild subcostal retractions, low back pain, right hip tenderness and painful and limited right range of motion. The patient's chest and pelvis radiographs showed a miliary pattern and right acetabulum osteolytic lesions, respectively. He was started on anti-TB medication and cefotaxime. Ofloxacin was added because of the concern of drug-resistant TB. The patient underwent a right hip debridement. His symptoms improved markedly, with improved mobility.

Clinical diagnosis of pyomyositis can be difficult often mimicking septic arthritis of the hip or appendicitis. We report a 12-year-old male with pyomyositis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae who presented with fever and severe right hip and abdominal pain. Magnetic resonance imaging of the right hip revealed the diagnosis of pyomyositis. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus pneumoniae, sensitive to penicillin, ceftriaxone, and clindamycin. He was successfully treated with a 3-week course of clindamycin. Early recognition, appropriate antibiotic therapy, and if indicated, drainage of the muscle abscess is critical to reduce morbidity and mortality.

### The painful total hip replacement [^e8c78bb9]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2004). Low credibility.

Total hip replacement is one of the most common and successful orthopaedic procedures. However, evaluation and treatment of the painful total hip replacement is one of the most difficult challenges for the arthroplasty surgeon. The differential diagnosis includes causes that are intrinsic and extrinsic to the hip. A thorough history and physical examination provide the basis for a focused, efficient workup of the painful total hip replacement. The temporal onset, duration, severity, site, and character of the pain all provide important clues in determining the cause of the painful total hip replacement. The physical examination should focus on tests and maneuvers that reproduce the patient's symptoms. Laboratory tests and radiographic evaluation are used selectively as indicated by the history and physical examination findings. With a careful and thorough evaluation, the cause of the painful total hip replacement can be determined in most patients, and the appropriate treatment can be initiated.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute hip pain: 2024 update [^a6a23f5e]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute hip pain can be related to any combination of hip fracture, dislocation, and/or soft tissue injury. These injuries require timely diagnosis to avoid associated complications, such as osteonecrosis or prolonged immobility. Imaging plays a crucial role in the evaluation of these injuries, noting that hip fractures cannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded via physical examination alone. Radiographs are the initial imaging modality of choice for acute hip pain. Several recent studies have evaluated specific scenarios in which cross-sectional imaging (CT and/or MRI) should also be obtained-these scenarios will be reviewed as separate variants within this document. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Pain images: hip pain – wrong diagnosis, wrong operation [^e6ff6505]. Pain Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The clinical presentation of retroperitoneal schwannoma with neuropathic pain and its subsequent management is presented.

Design and Setting

This is a case report of a 67-year-old woman who developed left hip pain radiating into the postero-lateral portion of her left thigh and extending to the knee.

Intervention

The patient underwent a left hip replacement for suspected pain from osteoarthritis of the hip joint.

Outcome Measure

The location of her pain was unchanged from the initial presentation, and more extensive investigations were carried out.

Result

The pain was found to be neuropathic in nature caused by a 54 mm retroperitoneal schwannoma.

Conclusion

Our case demonstrates the principle that unless the diagnosis is very clear (based on history, examination and diagnostic local anaesthetic injection, and confirmed by special investigations), surgery should not be considered. Where doubt exists, further assessment and investigation is required.

Hospital course

Prior to this admission, he received an extensive but unrevealing evaluation for malignancy at another hospital that included a negative CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis and further haematologic workup including bone marrow biopsy.

On arrival, his temperature was 36.9°C, heart rate 84 beats per minute, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, blood pressure 118/73 mmHg and O2 sat 99% on room air. He had mild conjunctival pallor and a salmon-pink patch on his nose and cheeks, not sparing the nasolabial folds. Hip flexor strength was limited to 4/5 bilaterally. There were no other neurological deficits, though he reported some transient right calf and bilateral hip pain that was neither present nor reproducible on exam. The rest of his physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory testing showed elevated inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate 88 mm/hr, C-reactive protein 134 mg/dL) with a ferritin of 995 ng/mL on admission. His interleukin panel showed elevated IL-10 (23.5 pg/mL) and IL-6 (38.4 pg/mL). His complete blood count demonstrated a mild normocytic anaemia (haemoglobin 10.7 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume 84 fL) with no leucocytosis (white blood cell count 5.5 x 10⁹/L) but relatively elevated polymorphonuclear count (78%). He had an elevated prothrombin time (16.2 s) with international normalized ratio 1.4.

During his hospital stay, his fever was monitored for 48 hours without antipyretics, and he was encouraged to keep a symptom diary during this time. After 48 hours, he was given acetaminophen 500 mg every 6 hours as needed to alleviate his symptoms.

By day 4, the patient developed worsening transaminitis (aspartate aminotransferase 37→64 U/L, alanine transaminase 53→140 U/L) with rising inflammatory markers and ferritin of 3220 ng/mL, with a further increase to 4000 ng/mL by day 6 (table 1). A repeat abdominal/pelvis CT scan with oral and intravenous contrast at that time showed mild hepatosplenomegaly without detectable lymphadenopathy, which had changed from the previous scan. Given concern for a trend towards macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), he was given systemic corticosteroids with significant improvement in his symptoms. He experienced a remission of his fevers and night sweats, and his inflammatory markers decreased dramatically. He was discharged soon after with a steroid taper.

### Current concepts review: evaluation and management of posterior hip pain [^d401edaf]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2018). Low credibility.

Understanding the etiology of and evolving research on intra- and extra-articular hip complaints requires comprehensive diagnosis and management of the spectrum of posterior hip diseases. Interest in posterior hip disorders has increased in recent years as new studies and theories have emerged regarding the disease process. Although most of the differential diagnoses around the posterior hip have traditionally been considered uncommon, recent reports suggest that these complaints have instead been commonly overlooked. Failure to identify the cause of posterior hip pain in a timely manner can increase pain perception, deteriorate the patient's hope, and consequently affect quality of life. Posterior hip pain could be differentiated as intrapelvic and extrapelvic, and differential diagnosis is made based on a comprehensive history, physical examination, and imaging studies. Plain radiography, CT, MRI, 3T MRI, and imaging-guided injection tests are usually necessary for accurate diagnosis. Surgical intervention, whether endoscopic or open, is required for patients with long-standing symptoms for whom nonsurgical treatment has been unsuccessful and who have experienced temporary relief of their symptoms after injection. Orthopedic surgeons are uniquely trained in understanding the anatomy, biomechanics, clinical evaluation and treatment of all five layers of the hip.

In her 20s and 30s she had episodes of a moderately severe deep ache in her right hip, lasting half an hour at a time, with normal examination during and between the pain. She could not recall the frequency of these episodes. At other times she had a sharp, severe, stabbing pain in her right or left hip, behind either eye, or in her right third toe. These pains came for a period of a day or two, occurred up to 20 times per day, and then abated for weeks or months. She had mild unilateral throbbing fronto-orbital headaches at other times, but never with the hip or stabbing pain. From her early 40s she had episodes of severe pain in the lower left half of her face, awakening her at night and localized to the lower molars, together with watering of both eyes. The pain lasted 20–40 minutes and was relieved by aspirin within 20–30 minutes. Sometimes she had the unilateral sensation that part of her face or her hand was enlarged for about 30 minutes just before the head pain started. From her early 40s she noted episodes of limb pain in her right or left hip, independently or associated in 50% of episodes with unilateral throbbing headache of moderate severity, nausea, photophobia and malaise. The limb pain occurred before and/or during the headache and lasted for about 30 minutes. The headache lasted longer than the limb pain (up to 60 minutes).

Patient III2

As a child, this patient had recurrent hip pain that was never diagnosed or investigated. As an adult, she had monthly (usually premenstrual) heavy, severe pain in her left jaw starting in the morning and accompanied later by pain in her left shoulder and left neck. During these pains she had blurring of her vision for 5–10 minutes and, at the same time, pain in her left hip and knee. The pains stopped her from doing her usual activities. The episodes lasted 2 hours.

### Consensus recommendations on the classification, definition and diagnostic criteria of hip-related pain in young and middle-aged active adults from the international hip-related pain research network, zurich 2018 [^f368efd2]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

There is no agreement on how to classify, define or diagnose hip-related pain-a common cause of hip and groin pain in young and middle-aged active adults. This complicates the work of clinicians and researchers. The International Hip-related Pain Research Network consensus group met in November 2018 in Zurich aiming to make recommendations on how to classify, define and diagnose hip disease in young and middle-aged active adults with hip-related pain as the main symptom. Prior to the meeting we performed a scoping review of electronic databases in June 2018 to determine the definition, epidemiology and diagnosis of hip conditions in young and middle-aged active adults presenting with hip-related pain. We developed and presented evidence-based statements for these to a panel of 37 experts for discussion and consensus agreement. Both non-musculoskeletal and serious hip pathological conditions (eg, tumours, infections, stress fractures, slipped capital femoral epiphysis), as well as competing musculoskeletal conditions (eg, lumbar spine) should be excluded when diagnosing hip-related pain in young and middle-aged active adults. The most common hip conditions in young and middle-aged active adults presenting with hip-related pain are: (1) femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome, (2) acetabular dysplasia and/or hip instability and (3) other conditions without a distinct osseous morphology (labral, chondral and/or ligamentum teres conditions), and that these terms are used in research and clinical practice. Clinical examination and diagnostic imaging have limited diagnostic utility; a comprehensive approach is therefore essential. A negative flexion-adduction-internal rotation test helps rule out hip-related pain although its clinical utility is limited. Anteroposterior pelvis and lateral femoral head-neck radiographs are the initial diagnostic imaging of choice-advanced imaging should be performed only when requiring additional detail of bony or soft-tissue morphology (eg, for definitive diagnosis, research setting or when planning surgery). We recommend clear, detailed and consistent methodology of bony morphology outcome measures (definition, measurement and statistical reporting) in research. Future research on conditions with hip-related pain as the main symptom should include high-quality prospective studies on aetiology and prognosis. The most common hip conditions in active adults presenting with hip-related pain are: (1) FAI syndrome, (2) acetabular dysplasia and/or hip instability and (3) other conditions without distinct osseous morphology including labral, chondral and/or ligamentum teres conditions. The last category should not be confused with the incidental imaging findings of labral, chondral and/or ligamentum teres pathology in asymptomatic people. Future research should refine our current recommendations by determining the clinical utility of clinical examination and diagnostic imaging in prospective studies.

### Hip pain and mobility deficits – hip osteoarthritis: clinical practice guidelines linked to the international classification of functioning, disability, and health from the orthopaedic section of the American Physical Therapy Association [^4a54a21f]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2009). Medium credibility.

Hip osteoarthritis — diagnosis/classification using history, examination, and radiographs is supported by typical clinical features. The diagnosis of hip OA can be made with a reasonable level of certainty on the basis of the history and physical examination, and joint space narrowing with osteophytes and subchondral sclerosis on plain film radiographs is considered the definitive diagnosis. Typical findings in individuals with radiographic hip OA include reports of moderate lateral or anterior hip pain with weight bearing, adults greater than 50 years of age, limited passive hip joint range of motion in at least 2 of its 6 directions (flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, internal rotation, and external rotation), and morning stiffness that improves in less than 1 hour.

### A 5-year-old with fever, headache, neck stiffness, and leg pain [^66ef1312]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

A 5-year-old boy presented with fever, headache, fatigue, neck stiffness, and 2 episodes of nocturnal urinary incontinence, prompting a visit to the emergency department. He had experienced intermittent frontal headaches and leg and buttock pain for several months, which had worsened over the previous 2 weeks. His history was notable for a spinal hemangioma with vascular tract, but he was otherwise healthy. On examination, he was febrile and tachycardic. He held his neck slightly rotated to the right with limited range of motion in all directions due to pain. No focal neurologic deficits were noted, and sensation and deep tendon reflexes were intact bilaterally. He was able to bear weight on both legs. There was no spinal tenderness or limitation in range of motion of his back and hips. There were no cutaneous manifestations, including no sacral dimple. A complete blood count with differential revealed leukocytosis of 31.98 × 103/µL (78.6% neutrophils, 16% bands). C-reactive protein was elevated at 2.4 mg/dL (0–1 mg/dL), and serum electrolytes, liver function tests, uric acid, and lactate dehydrogenase were within normal limits for age. Blood cultures were obtained before admission. Here we present his case, diagnostic evaluation, ultimate diagnosis, and complications.

Case report

A 45-year-old female was referred to our dermatology practice with a prior 15-year history of plaque psoriasis, reported to be biopsy-proven and diagnosed in India. She presented with a pruritic, hyperkeratotic, and violaceous eruption on her bilateral ankles, wrists, back, and hips (Fig 1). She complained of itch and pain in her vulva for the last 1 year. She trialed topical calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate on these lesions for several weeks without significant improvement. A biopsy of the right ankle was performed with prominent histopathological findings including hyperkeratosis, irregular acanthosis, and hypergranulosis of the basal epidermis with dense lymphocytic infiltrates of the epidermal-dermal junction. This was in keeping with a diagnosis of cutaneous LP with hypertrophic morphological features.

Double attack at the hip with dysplasia and TB poses double set of problems, both for the patient and the treating surgeon. The primary aim should be targeted toward an early diagnosis of the infection, early institution of medical management, and uneventful resolution of the disease so as to save adequate anatomy for future reconstruction of the hip. Until that time adequate counseling, reassurance and periodic monitoring are all that is required to be performed. To our knowledge, this is the first such case being reported in the literature.

Introduction: Limping is a common chief complaint in the Pediatric Emergency Department. It is important to differentiate among the multitude of diagnoses evaluating associated symptoms, diagnostic tests, physical examination, and patient's age.

Objectives: To present a case of unusual limping child.

Methods: A two-year-old male admitted to our Unit due to a month history of right-sided limping not relieved by NSAIDS. No history of trauma or fever in his medical history except for recent coryzal symptoms.

Results: On the clinical evaluation, the child was afebrile with minimal limitation of internal and external rotation of the right hip. Bilateral hip ultrasound showed right intracapsular effusion. Blood tests including full blood count and C reactive protein were normal. Pelvis X-ray revealed an oval area (maximum diameter 25 x 17 mm) of bone erosion with irregular margins involving the proximal right femoral diaphysis. CT scan confirmed the lytic lesion surrounded by an irregular, discontinuous and scalloped bone border. MRI better defined multiloculated appearance with multiple cyst-like areolae containing fluid levels. All those findings were consistent with an aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC), confirmed by biopsy. Curettage of the cyst was performed, and the cystic space was filled with an injectable bone sostitute.

Conclusion: ABC is a non-neoplastic osteolytic lesion that may exist as a primary bone cyst or as a secondary lesion arising from other osseous conditions such as giant cell tumors or unicameral bone cysts. ABC is exceptionally rare with a reported incidence of 0.14 per 100,000 individuals. Lesions occur primarily in the first and second decades of life. The long bones (especially the tibiae and femur) and vertebrae are the most common sites. Pain is the most common clinical symptom at presentation. The radiographic differential diagnosis includes unicameral bone cysts, giant cell tumors, osteosarcoma, and osteoblastoma (in vertebral lesions). The diagnosis must be based on histopathologic evidence. Local recurrence rate after classic surgical procedures (curettage and grafting) is about 11.8–30.8%. ABC is an uncommon cause of limping in children but should be considered in the patient with a persistent limp after more common causes have been excluded. The combination of different imaging modalities including plain radiography, CT scan, MRI, and bone scans helps to accurately establish and confirm the diagnosis.

### Chronic arthritis of the hip joint: an unusual complication of an inadequately treated fistula-in-ano [^7fb7ef46]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

We report a case of chronic arthritis of the right hip joint in an otherwise healthy young male athlete as a complication of inadequately treated anal fistula. A young male athlete presented with symptoms of right hip pain and difficulty in walking and intermittent fever for 2months. He had a history of perianal abscess drainage. On examination he was found to have a tender right hip joint with severe restriction of movements. He was also found to have a partially drained right ischiorectal abscess. X-ray and MRI of the hip joint revealed chronic arthritis of the right hip joint, which was communicating with a complex fistula-in-ano. He underwent a diversion sigmoid colostomy and right ischiorectal abscess drainage along with appropriate antibiotics with a plan for definitive hip joint procedure later. He was lost to follow-up and succumbed to severe perianal sepsis within a few months.

### Hip pain in adults: evaluation and differential diagnosis… [^4d411868]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

FEMOROACETABULAR IMPINGEMENT Femoroacetabular impingement is one of the most common causes of hip pain in young adults. OSTEOARTHRITIS In older adults, osteoarthritis of the femoroacetabular joint is the most common cause of anterior hip pain. 3 It can lead to significant morbidity and decrease in physical activity. Osteoarthritis of the hip typically has a gradual onset, but some patients recall a specific injury or fall. Patients with this condition may have pain with sitting and ambulating for long periods and may have an antalgic gait. Physical examination maneuvers such as flexion and internal and external rotation may reproduce pain, and range of motion may be decreased. 4, 6. PIRIFORMIS AND DEEP GLUTEAL SYNDROME Piriformis syndrome is thought to be a result of the piriformis muscle entrapping the sciatic nerve, causing hip and buttock pain and sciatica.

Piriformis syndrome is a subset of deep gluteal syndrome, which includes entrapment of the sciatic nerve and/or pudendal nerve by the piriformis muscle, gemelliobturator internus, or proximal hamstrings. ISCHIOFEMORAL IMPINGEMENT Ischiofemoral impingement is impingement of the quadratus femoris muscle and nerve between the proximal femur at the level of the lesser trochanter and the ischial tuberosity. 19 Patients with ischiofemoral impingement have gradual onset of deep buttock pain that is worsened with activities requiring a long stride, such as running. The long-stride walking test is the most sensitive and specific test for this condition. 18, 19. 17 Sacroiliac joint dysfunction and/or arthritis may also present as posterior hip pain. The most common physical examination finding is tenderness to palpation over the sacroiliac joint. Sacroiliac pain typically does not occur above the L5 level, which would indicate a lumbar spinal etiology of pain.

17 Radiography may show sacroiliac joint arthritis. Image-guided injections may be a helpful diagnostic and therapeutic tool. If diagnosis is uncertain, MRI can show inflammation or arthritis at the sacroiliac joint.

### Slipped capital femoral epiphysis in an adult patient with kabuki syndrome [^47c8f88f]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Case

A 19-year-old man presented to the emergency department for evaluation of right hip pain for the past 2 weeks with the inability to walk. The patient had no previous difficulty ambulating. Medical history included Kabuki syndrome, obesity, developmental delay, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and double outlet right ventricle requiring previous open heart surgery. The patient was been followed closely within our institution, including evaluation by endocrinology. The patient had no known endocrine disorder. Comprehensive laboratory and genetic studies had been done without any endocrine disorder identified. On physical examination, the patient's right leg was externally rotated. Any movement of the right hip caused severe pain and guarding, limiting the examination. The patient was unable to ambulate, even with crutches.

Radiographs of the pelvis and right hip showed a right SCFE, with epiphyseal-diaphyseal angle (Southwick slip angle) of 75° (Figure 1). An ultrasonography was ordered which revealed the presence of a right hip effusion (Figure 2). These images and examination confirmed the diagnosis of an acute severe unstable SCFE. The patient was taken to the operating room where an anterior Smith-Peterson approach was done and a capsulotomy was made revealing the presence of a hemarthrosis. A reduction was done with gentle pressure on the anterior aspect of the metaphysis as previously described by Parsch et al. Two cannulated screws were placed across the physis to maintain the reduction. The contralateral hip was also pinned prophylactically given the atypical SCFE (Figure 3).

Figure 1
Radiographs at time of presentation — AP pelvis and lateral view of the right hip.

The patient was made non–weight-bearing on the right hip for 6 weeks while maintaining weight bearing as tolerated on the left side. He began walking independently 8 weeks postoperatively. At last follow-up, 7 months postoperatively, the patient was back to baseline function, and radiographs did not reveal any signs of osteonecrosis of the femoral head. The physes of bilateral proximal femurs were still open.

The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2009). Medium credibility.

Hip osteoarthritis — diagnosis and classification — moderate lateral or anterior hip pain during weight bearing, in adults over the age of 50 years, with morning stiffness less than 1 hour, with limited hip internal rotation and hip flexion by more than 15° when comparing the painful to the nonpainful side are useful clinical findings to classify a patient with hip pain into the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) category of unilateral coxarthrosis and the associated International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) impairment-based category of hip pain (b2816 Pain in joints) and mobility deficits (b7100 Mobility of a single joint). (Recommendation based on strong evidence.) Clinicians should consider diagnostic classifications other than osteoarthritis of the hip when the patient's history, reported activity limitations, or impairments of body function and structure are not consistent with those presented in the diagnosis/classification section of this guideline, or when the patient's symptoms are not diminishing with interventions aimed at normalization of the patient's impairments of body function. (Recommendation based on expert opinion.)

### An uncommon late complication of appendicitis [^98ff6176]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2010). Low credibility.

A 10-year-old boy presented with a 2.5-week history of right leg pain and limp. A right flank mass was noted by a parent on the day of presentation. The child's past medical history was remarkable for perforated appendicitis treated with an interval laparoscopic appendectomy 2 years before this presentation. Abdominal and pelvic computed tomography revealed a retroperitoneal mass with calcifications, suggestive of a retained appendicolith with abscess formation. This case illustrates the importance of considering very late complications of appendicitis in patients presenting with fever and abdominal or flank pain or masses.

### Bilateral atraumatic femoral neck fractures resulting from transient osteoporosis of the hip [^c6ae3b9b]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A woman in her mid-30s presented to the orthopaedic team, unable to mobilise, shortly after her caesarean section. On questioning, she reported 10 weeks of atraumatic right hip pain. A radiograph revealed a displaced right subcapital neck of femur fracture. An MRI confirmed this, as well as identifying a minimally displaced left subcapital neck of femur fracture. She underwent a right total hip replacement and internal fixation of the left hip. A dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan showed severe osteoporosis, and a diagnosis of transient osteoporosis of the hip was made. She was seen by the bone metabolism team and given calcium and vitamin D medication. Although atraumatic hip fractures are rare in young patients, disproportionate or persisting hip pain in pregnant patients should raise the index of suspicion and prompt further investigation in the form of an MRI. This will allow timely management of hip fractures and improve patient outcomes.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of pediatric hip pain [^324af3d3]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Hip pain is a common complaint in children and adolescents. The clinical history and examination, age, gender and body habitus helps focus the differential diagnosis. It is important to recognize serious causes of hip pain and in particular to differentiate infection from transient synovitis. Radiographs are useful in the evaluation of a child with hip pain and can help identify the need for further imaging and referral.

### Acetabular labral tears of the hip in women [^2083eaeb]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Acetabular labral tears are a major cause of hip dysfunction in young patients and a primary precursor to hip osteoarthritis. In addition, labral disease more commonly occurs in women and can present with nonspecific symptoms. It is possible to diagnose, quantify, and treat labral tears before the onset of secondary joint deterioration. However, the diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion, special attention to subtle patterns of presentation, and timely consideration for imaging studies. Treatment options are still evolving and include a wide array of nonsurgical and surgical techniques. Treatment should also address secondary dysfunction that can be associated with hip pathology. An initial trial of conservative management is recommended and failure to progress is an indication for surgical consultation.

### 2021 AHA / ACC / ASE / CHEST / SAEM / SCCT / SCMR guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^22b11033]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes (Table 3) note that anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort and typically build in intensity over a few minutes. Sharp chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease, and fleeting chest pain — of few seconds' duration — is unlikely to be related to ischemic heart disease. Sudden onset of ripping chest pain (with radiation to the upper or lower back) is unlikely to be angina and is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Pain that can be localized to a very limited area or that radiates to below the umbilicus or hip is unlikely related to myocardial ischemia. Occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS, whereas positional chest pain is usually nonischemic. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common symptoms associated with myocardial ischemia include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, heartburn unrelated to meals, and nausea or vomiting; symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing or sharp pain, or throat/abdominal discomfort may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.

### Tenosynovial giant cell tumor mimicking acute septic arthritis of the hip: a case report [^570056df]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Case Report

A 12-year-old boy presented to the pediatric emergency department with a 5-day history of atraumatic, progressively worsening right hip pain. The patient and his parents recall a possible fall from a swing set around the time the pain started, but they were not able to definitively correlate this low-energy traumatic event with his symptoms. He was initially seen at an outside emergency department, where his erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count (WBC), and radiographs of the hip were normal. He was subsequently diagnosed with transient synovitis. The night following this initial emergency department visit, he was awakened from sleep by his right hip pain and was unable to bear weight on the right lower extremity. He returned to the outside emergency department again the next day reporting of worsened right hip pain and was discharged with additional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories. He was then seen by an outside orthopaedic surgeon, who recommended that the patient present to the pediatric emergency department (level 1 pediatric trauma center) for additional evaluation given the clinical concern for septic arthritis.

At the time of presentation to our institution's emergency department, the patient reported notable right hip pain making him unable to bear weight and waking him from sleep. Of note, he had been afebrile since the onset of his pain. On examination, the patient refused to bear weight on the right lower extremity and held the right hip in flexion, abduction, and external rotation. Interestingly, within a moderate arc of hip range of motion, he had minimal pain. However, at the extremes of internal rotation, especially with the hip flexed, he had increased pain. He was also acutely tender over the medial groin region and the adductor tendons. He was afebrile (T: 37°C), and his WBC count was within normal limits (6,050 WBCs/mm 3). However, ESR and CRP were elevated to 42 mm/hr and 6.6 mg/dL, respectively (institutional reference ranges: ESR 1 to 15 mm/hr; CRP < 0.5 mg/dL).

### Infographic. consensus recommendations on the classification, definition and diagnostic criteria of hip-related pain in young and middle-aged active adults from the international hip-related pain research network, zurich 2018 [^bb77ff2b]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The diagnostic clinical utility for the various clinical and radiological measures was stratified according to magnitude of the pretest to post-test probability shift, precision (repeatability of the results), and study quality. Each of these values were represented on a 2×2 quadrant (magnitude×precision) as not recommended (red quadrant), cautiously recommended (yellow quadrants) or recommended (green quadrant) if the study quality was high.

We determined that the diagnostic utility of clinical examination and diagnostic imaging in isolation are limited and recommend a comprehensive diagnostic approach of patient symptoms, clinical signs and diagnostic imaging. We recognise that the diagnostic capability of matching symptoms, clinical signs and diagnostic imaging is unknown for patients with hip-related pain and recommend that future studies be considered in determining such diagnostic utilities.

### Atypical hip pain: coexistence of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and osteoid osteoma [^36333c9e]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

The objective of this article was to emphasize the importance of including less common causes of hip pain in a differential diagnosis, particularly when clinical and radiographic variables are atypical. This article presents the case of a 52-year-old patient with a history of progressive hip pain resulting from the coexistence of both a femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and an intraarticular osteoid osteoma. The intraarticular osteoid osteoma was initially overlooked due to its unremarkable features on radiographic and resonance imaging. Consequently, the patient was surgically treated for FAI with only partial relief. An osteolytic nidus characteristic of osteoid osteoma was discovered only 1.5 years following surgery. The patient was subsequently treated for osteoid osteoma with anti-inflammatories, after which his pain began to resolve. The patient was completely pain free after 7 months. Level of evidence V.

### 2021 AHA / ACC / ASE / CHEST / SAEM / SCCT / SCMR guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^9da6938f]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes: Anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort including pain, discomfort, heaviness, tightness, pressure, constriction, or squeezing, whereas sharp pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease and usually occurs with acute pericarditis. Anginal symptoms gradually build in intensity over a few minutes, while sudden onset of ripping chest pain with radiation to the upper or lower back is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Pain that can be localized to a very limited area and pain radiating to below the umbilicus or hip are unlikely related to myocardial ischemia. Occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS, and relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common associated symptoms include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, or heartburn unrelated to meals and nausea or vomiting, and symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing or sharp pain, or throat/abdominal discomfort may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.
