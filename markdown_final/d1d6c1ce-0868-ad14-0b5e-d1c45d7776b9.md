Treatment abscess

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about abscess treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core principle of source control and how it varies by abscess type. Then, I should verify when antibiotics are indicated versus when they are not. Next, I will examine abscess-specific management for skin, anorectal, diverticular, brain, and breast abscesses. After that, I need to check procedural nuances like packing, irrigation, and closure. Finally, I will consider special populations, recurrence prevention, and synthesize a practical decision framework with shared decision-making in mind.

> Let me first confirm the universal principle: source control is the cornerstone of abscess management across all types, and I should not jump to conclusions about substituting antibiotics for drainage when pus is present. Incision and drainage is the primary therapy for most superficial abscesses, with exceptions where percutaneous drainage or neurosurgical intervention is indicated, and antibiotics alone are generally insufficient when there is a drainable collection [^7bb5a1fd] [^9e6d1a24] [^4e49421d].

> Hold on, let's not conflate categories. I need to distinguish simple from complex skin and soft tissue infections. For uncomplicated cutaneous abscesses, drainage alone is usually curative, whereas complex abscesses or those with systemic features warrant broader management, including empiric antibiotics and sometimes imaging or specialty input, so I should verify these distinctions before recommending antibiotics [^2e3c2781] [^2c9ce396].

> Next, I should review when antibiotics are indicated after drainage. I initially thought antibiotics never help after adequate I&D, but wait, let me verify the newer evidence. Contemporary randomized trials and meta-analyses show that adding TMP-SMX or clindamycin to I&D modestly reduces treatment failure and recurrence, so a weak recommendation supports offering antibiotics with shared decision-making, especially when pain, location, or recurrence risk matter to the patient [^89221378] [^05142f78] [^da4a44ed].

> I need to ensure I specify the right antibiotics when they are used. For uncomplicated skin abscesses after I&D, TMP-SMX or clindamycin are preferred over cephalosporins because cephalosporins likely add little benefit against MRSA, which is common in this setting. I should double-check that this applies across typical sizes and settings, and yes, the evidence generalizes to adults and children in ED and outpatient settings [^89221378] [^4fc6c807] [^7c69d1d9].

> But wait, what if the abscess is anorectal? I should confirm that surgical drainage remains mandatory for anorectal abscesses, with antibiotics reserved for cellulitis, systemic illness, or immunocompromise. Delaying drainage increases recurrence and morbidity, so prompt I&D is the standard, and packing is not routinely required after drainage [^eae1f347] [^3f425e3f] [^cd0a59c4].

> Let me consider diverticular abscesses next. Size guides therapy: small abscesses under about 3–5 cm often respond to antibiotics alone, whereas larger abscesses generally require image-guided percutaneous drainage plus antibiotics. I should confirm that this size-based approach is supported by guidelines and observational data, and yes, both WSES and ASCRS endorse this stratification with moderate-quality evidence [^4f7677ec] [^aaee7f9c] [^1e42fae6].

> For brain abscess, I need to check neurosurgical source control and antimicrobial penetration. Aspiration or excision is recommended when feasible, and empiric therapy should cover staphylococci, streptococci, and anaerobes, typically with a third-generation cephalosporin plus metronidazole, extending to 6–8 weeks total. In severe immunocompromise, broader coverage including TMP-SMX and voriconazole is advised, and I should confirm that withholding antibiotics briefly is acceptable if surgery is imminent [^4e49421d] [^66046d13] [^efecaf29].

> Breast abscesses in lactation are a bit different, so I should verify the balance between aspiration and I&D. Ultrasound-guided needle aspiration is preferred for small abscesses to preserve breastfeeding, but I&D has lower failure though it may interrupt lactation. Evidence is limited and heterogeneous, so I need to individualize based on size, maternal preference, and response [^9e1ce11a].

> I will now examine procedural nuances. Loop drainage is a reasonable alternative to traditional I&D for cutaneous abscesses and may reduce returns and complications, so I should consider it when available. Irrigation has not shown benefit and may increase pain, so I should avoid routine irrigation. Primary closure can shorten healing time with similar recurrence, but I should select cases carefully and align with patient preference and local practice [^ae60f08c] [^6956a36c] [^9071fad3].

> Hold on, I should verify packing practices. For perianal abscesses, routine packing does not clearly improve healing or reduce recurrence and may increase pain, so I should avoid routine packing and tailor to local expertise and patient comfort. Similarly, for simple cutaneous abscesses, packing is often unnecessary and may cause more pain without benefit [^83c824c2] [^60f646c9].

> Next, I should review special populations and recurrence prevention. In pediatrics, principles mirror adults with drainage first, and antibiotics reserved for systemic illness or failure. In immunocompromised patients, lower thresholds for antibiotics, imaging, and specialty input are appropriate. For recurrent S. aureus abscesses, obtain cultures, treat identified foci, and consider decolonization strategies such as intranasal mupirocin and chlorhexidine, recognizing that evidence quality varies [^22bde77c] [^cb34eea6] [^0d1ae6e9].

> I need to ensure I address duration and stewardship. Shorter antibiotic courses, often 5–7 days, are reasonable after adequate source control, and extending beyond 10 days rarely adds benefit. I should also remember that in perforated appendicitis with postoperative abscess, extending IV antibiotics beyond 7 days is not recommended, reinforcing the principle of minimizing exposure once clinically improving [^492daa25].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework. First, assess source control needs and secure drainage when indicated. Second, classify the abscess type and severity to determine whether antibiotics are necessary. Third, if antibiotics are indicated, choose MRSA-active agents for skin abscesses, appropriate empiric regimens for anorectal or brain abscesses, and size-guided strategies for diverticular abscesses. Fourth, tailor procedural technique to patient and setting, favoring loop drainage or selective primary closure when appropriate. Finally, engage in shared decision-making for marginal benefit scenarios and arrange follow-up to ensure resolution and address recurrence risks [^89221378] [^4f7677ec] [^4e49421d] [^ae60f08c].

> In conclusion, I should confirm that my bottom line aligns with high-quality guidance: drainage remains foundational, antibiotics are adjuncts with modest benefit in select scenarios, and patient-centered choices about antibiotics after I&D should be made transparently. This approach balances efficacy, safety, and stewardship while remaining adaptable to abscess type, size, host factors, and local resources [^89221378] [^7bb5a1fd] [^4f7677ec].

Treatment of abscesses centers on **source control** (incision and drainage) [^7bb5a1fd] for most cutaneous abscesses, with **antibiotics reserved** for systemic features, immunocompromise, or high-risk sites (face, hand, perianal) [^22bde77c] [^3f425e3f]. For uncomplicated skin abscesses, **adjunctive antibiotics** (TMP-SMX or clindamycin) modestly reduce failure and recurrence after drainage, but shared decision-making is essential given adverse effects and resistance risk [^89221378] [^05142f78]. Larger or deep abscesses (e.g. diverticular, brain, liver) often need image-guided drainage plus targeted antibiotics; small abscesses may respond to antibiotics alone with close follow-up [^4f7677ec] [^4e49421d]. Routine packing, irrigation, or cultures are not required for simple abscesses, but cultures are reasonable for recurrent or complex cases [^60f646c9] [^9de8b8a0].

---

## General principles of abscess management

- **Source control**: Incision and drainage (I&D) is the cornerstone of abscess management, as antibiotics alone cannot eradicate purulent collections [^7bb5a1fd].

- **Antibiotic use**: Antibiotics are adjuncts, not substitutes, for drainage. They are indicated for systemic signs, immunocompromise, or high-risk anatomical locations [^22bde77c] [^3f425e3f].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, comorbidities, and immune status influence treatment choice and urgency [^notfound].

---

## Cutaneous abscesses

### Uncomplicated cutaneous abscesses

- **Primary treatment**: I&D is the standard of care [^7bb5a1fd].

- **Adjunctive antibiotics**: TMP-SMX or clindamycin modestly reduce treatment failure and recurrence after I&D, but shared decision-making is recommended due to adverse effects and resistance risk [^89221378] [^05142f78].

- **Cephalosporins**: Not recommended routinely due to limited MRSA activity [^89221378].

- **Routine packing/irrigation**: Not required; packing may increase pain without benefit [^60f646c9] [^6956a36c].

---

### Complicated cutaneous abscesses

Complicated cutaneous abscesses (e.g. perianal, IV drug use, immunocompromised) require **broad-spectrum antibiotics** with MRSA coverage plus prompt surgical drainage [^2c9ce396] [^73fb6948]. Cultures are reasonable in recurrent or complex cases to guide therapy and detect resistance [^9de8b8a0].

---

## Deep-seated abscesses

### Intra-abdominal abscesses (e.g. diverticular, liver, Crohn's)

- **Small abscesses (< 3–5 cm)**: Antibiotics alone may suffice with close monitoring [^4f7677ec] [^1e42fae6].

- **Larger abscesses**: Image-guided percutaneous drainage plus antibiotics is standard [^4f7677ec] [^aaee7f9c].

- **Crohn's disease**: Drainage followed by interval elective resection or medical therapy is recommended [^da0c6b54].

---

### Brain abscesses

Brain abscesses require **early neurosurgical consultation** for aspiration or excision, plus prolonged antibiotics (6–8 weeks) [^4e49421d]. Empiric therapy should cover staphylococci, streptococci, and anaerobes (e.g. ceftriaxone + metronidazole ± vancomycin) [^66046d13].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Similar principles apply; antibiotics are reserved for systemic illness or high-risk features [^notfound].

- **Recurrent abscesses**: Evaluate for underlying causes (e.g. hidradenitis, immunodeficiency) and consider decolonization strategies [^cb34eea6].

- **Breast abscesses**: Ultrasound-guided aspiration is preferred in lactational abscesses to preserve breastfeeding [^7a762148].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Abscess type** | **Primary treatment** | **Adjunctive antibiotics** | **Special considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Uncomplicated cutaneous | Incision and drainage | TMP-SMX or clindamycin (shared decision) | Avoid routine packing/irrigation |
| Complicated cutaneous | Incision and drainage | Broad-spectrum (MRSA coverage) | Cultures if recurrent/complex |
| Intra-abdominal (small) | Antibiotics alone | Broad-spectrum | Close monitoring |
| Intra-abdominal (large) | Percutaneous drainage + antibiotics | Broad-spectrum | Image guidance |
| Brain abscess | Neurosurgical drainage | Ceftriaxone + metronidazole ± vancomycin | 6–8 weeks therapy |
| Breast (lactational) | Ultrasound-guided aspiration | Antibiotics if systemic signs | Preserve breastfeeding |

---

Effective abscess management hinges on **timely drainage** and judicious antibiotics, with therapy tailored to abscess size, location, and patient factors. Shared decision-making is essential when benefits and harms are closely balanced [^89221378].

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^9411e054]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

What role do antibiotics have in the treatment of uncomplicated skin abscesses after incision and drainage? A recent study suggested that, for small uncomplicated skin abscesses, antibiotics after incision and drainage improve the chance of short term cure compared with placebo. Triggered by this trial, the Rapid Recommendation team produced a new systematic review. Relying on this review and using the GRADE framework according to the BMJ Rapid Recommendation process, an expert panel makes a weak recommendation in favour of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX, co-trimoxazole) or clindamycin in addition to incision and drainage over incision and drainage alone. For patients who have chosen to initiate antibiotics, the panel issues a strong recommendation for TMP-SMX or clindamycin rather than a cephalosporin and a weak recommendation for TMP-SMX rather than clindamycin. Box 1 shows the articles and evidence linked to this Rapid Recommendation. The infographic presents the recommendations together with other pertinent information, including an overview of the absolute benefits and harms of candidate antibiotics in the standard GRADE format. The panel emphasises shared decision making in the choice of whether to initiate antibiotics and in which antibiotic to use, because the desirable and undesirable consequences are closely balanced: clinicians using MAGICapp will find decision aids to support the discussion with patients.

### How do you treat an abscess in the era of increased community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)? [^118f47d7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In the era of increased prevalence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), there have been a number of questions and several recent studies that address the clinical management of uncomplicated abscesses in the emergency department (ED).

Discussion

We examine the historical and clinical predictors for MRSA in patients with an uncomplicated abscess and review the evidence behind the use of wound cultures, decolonization, antibiotics, irrigation, and packing after incision and drainage. We found that current recommendations and treatment guidelines are often based on limited data, expert opinion, and anecdotal experience.

Conclusion

In light of the data currently available, antibiotics and decolonization should be used selectively, not routinely, for treatment of most uncomplicated abscesses. Wound cultures are generally not necessary in the ED, and all patients should be given return precautions for worsening symptoms.

### 2020 update of the WSES guidelines for the management of acute colonic diverticulitis in the emergency setting [^1e42fae6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

What is the best treatment for patients with a small diverticular abscess (< 4–5 cm)? What is the best treatment for patients with large diverticular abscess?

For patients with a small (< 4–5 cm) diverticular abscess, we suggest an initial trial of non-operative treatment with antibiotics alone (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

We suggest to treat patients with large abscesses with percutaneous drainage combined with antibiotic treatment; whenever percutaneous drainage of the abscess is not feasible or not available, we suggest to initially treat patients with large abscesses with antibiotic therapy alone, clinical conditions permitting. Alternatively, an operative intervention is required (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

Approximately 15–20% of patients admitted with acute diverticulitis have an abscess on CT scan. The treatment of abscess always requires antibiotic therapy. If the abscess is limited in size, systemic antibiotic therapy alone is considered safe and effective in removing the abscess and solving acute inflammation with a pooled failure rate of 20% and a mortality rate of 0.6%.

Education into practice

Do you currently consider antibiotics for patients with uncomplicated skin abscesses after surgical treatment?
What information could you share with your patient to help reach a decision together?
Would you consider using online decision aid tools (such as the one available on MAGICapp) to facilitate shared decision making?

How patients were involved in the creation of this article

Three people with lived experience of skin abscesses were full panel members: two had previously experienced skin abscesses before (one with recurrent abscesses), and one person is a parent of a child who experienced a skin abscess. These panel members identified patient-important outcomes, and led the discussion on values and preferences. These patient partners agreed that, although pain reduction was the most important outcome to them, these values may not be shared by all patients. The close balance between desirable and undesirable consequences made it difficult for them (and the panel) to decide which options most individuals would choose.

### European society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases guidelines on diagnosis and treatment of brain abscess in children and adults [^4e49421d]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Scope

These European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases guidelines are intended for clinicians involved in diagnosis and treatment of brain abscess in children and adults.

Methods

Key questions were developed, and a systematic review was carried out of all studies published since 1 January 1996, using the search terms 'brain abscess' OR 'cerebral abscess' as Mesh terms or text in electronic databases of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane registry. The search was updated on 29 September 2022. Exclusion criteria were a sample size < 10 patients or publication in non-English language. Extracted data was summarized as narrative reviews and tables. Meta-analysis was carried out using a random effects model and heterogeneity was examined by I² tests as well as funnel and Galbraith plots. Risk of bias was assessed using Risk Of Bias in Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) (observational studies) and Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) (diagnostic studies). The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was applied to classify strength of recommendations (strong or conditional) and quality of evidence (high, moderate, low, or very low).

Questions Addressed By The Guidelines and Recommendations

Magnetic resonance imaging is recommended for diagnosis of brain abscess (strong and high). Antimicrobials may be withheld until aspiration or excision of brain abscess in patients without severe disease if neurosurgery can be carried out within reasonable time, preferably within 24 hours (conditional and low). Molecular-based diagnostics are recommended, if available, in patients with negative cultures (conditional and moderate). Aspiration or excision of brain abscess is recommended whenever feasible, except for cases with toxoplasmosis (strong and low). Recommended empirical antimicrobial treatment for community-acquired brain abscess in immuno-competent individuals is a 3rd-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole (strong and moderate) with the addition of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and voriconazole in patients with severe immuno-compromise (conditional and low). Recommended empirical treatment of post-neurosurgical brain abscess is a carbapenem combined with vancomycin or linezolid (conditional and low). The recommended duration of antimicrobial treatment is 6–8 weeks (conditional and low). No recommendation is offered for early transition to oral antimicrobials because of a lack of data, and oral consolidation treatment after ≥ 6 weeks of intravenous antimicrobials is not routinely recommended (conditional and very low). Adjunctive glucocorticoid treatment is recommended for treatment of severe symptoms because of perifocal oedema or impending herniation (strong and low). Primary prophylaxis with antiepileptics is not recommended (conditional and very low). Research needs are addressed.

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^f7a1bbc9]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Future research

Key research questions to inform decision makers and future guidelines are:

What is the impact of different types of antibiotics in settings where MRSA is rare (prevalence < 10%)?
Do antibiotics have different effects in different populations, such as people who are immunocompromised or in people with recurrent skin abscesses?
What are the long term effects (such as > 6 months) of antibiotics on abscess recurrence, Clostridium difficile infection, and MRSA resistance to TMP-SMX or clindamycin?
Is a shorter course of antibiotics (such as 5 days) as effective as a longer course (10 days)?
Is topical therapy (such as iodine, honey, silver, other antimicrobials) effective for treating uncomplicated skin abscesses compared with systemic therapy? Do other adjunctive measures, such as nasal decontamination or antisepsis for the body, reduce the risk that skin abscesses will recur?

### 2020 update of the WSES guidelines for the management of acute colonic diverticulitis in the emergency setting [^aaee7f9c]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for intra-abdominal abscess, more specifically with respect to patients with diverticular abscess, large abscesses, WSES 2020 guidelines recommend to consider performing percutaneous drainage combined with antibiotic therapy in patients with large abscesses. Consider administering an initial treatment with antibiotic therapy alone, if clinical condition permits, when percutaneous drainage of the abscess is not feasible or not available. Perform an operative intervention as an alternative option.

---

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^4fc6c807]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

The panel is confident that the evidence applies to almost all patients with uncomplicated skin abscesses treated with incision and drainage: adults and children, patients presenting to emergency departments and to primary care practices, smaller and larger abscesses, first abscess occurrences and recurrences, and abscesses with unknown infection pathogens. The systematic review and meta-analyses contained adequate representation from such groups and settings, and results were consistent between pre-specified subgroups.

Values and preferences

The panel believes that there is a high degree of variability between patients and carers weighing the expected desirable and undesirable consequences of antibiotic therapy compared with no antibiotic therapy. This variation is reflected in the weak recommendation, which warrants shared decision making to ensure that each individual's decision is in line with what they consider most important. The expected benefit of antibiotic therapy in reducing pain, risk of treatment failure, and recurrence is modest, but large enough that the panel anticipates that most fully informed patients would value these benefits sufficiently to choose antibiotic treatment. This might particularly be the case when, for example, the abscess is very painful, perhaps because of location in sensitive places (such as groin, axillae, etc).

For patients who decide to initiate antibiotic treatment, reasonable choices include either TMP-SMX or clindamycin. In some settings, cephalosporins or other antibiotics are often prescribed for skin abscesses. Given that, in most circumstances, cephalosporins probably do not provide any additional benefit beyond incision and drainage alone, the panel felt that all or almost all patients would choose to use antibiotic options with proven efficacy (TMP-SMX or clindamycin), hence the strong recommendation against cephalosporins.

People who place a higher value on the possibility of avoiding abscess recurrence may choose clindamycin, while those who place a higher value on avoiding diarrhoea and on minimising costs are likely to prefer TMP-SMX.

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^137b3cd8]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Regarding medical management for skin abscess, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, initial empiric therapy, BMJ 2018 guidelines recommend to consider administering TMP/SMX or clindamycin along with incision and drainage rather than incision and drainage alone in patients with an uncomplicated skin abscess. Discuss both options with each patient.

### Epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of brain abscesses [^10cd93b4]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This article describes the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of brain abscesses focusing on studies published in the past 2 years.

Recent Findings

In the recent literature, advances have been made in describing the disease, ancillary investigations, and treatment, mostly by combining previously available literature in meta-analyses. These studies identified Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species as the most frequent cause of brain abscess. New developments include the analysis of genetic risk factors for brain abscess, evaluation of shorter antibiotic courses, and the use of hyperbaric oxygen treatment. However, many studies in this field are limited by methodology and results are less helpful for clinical practice. Nevertheless, there has been a gradual improvement in the outcome of patients with brain abscess over the past 50 years, which might be driven by improved brain imaging techniques, minimally invasive neurosurgical procedures, and protocoled antibiotic treatment. Multicenter prospective studies and randomized clinical trials are needed to further advance treatment and prognosis in brain abscess patients.

Summary

Our understanding of brain abscesses has increased by meta-analysis on clinical characteristics, ancillary investigations, and treatment modalities. Prognosis has improved over time, likely due to improved brain imaging techniques, minimally invasive neurosurgical procedures, and protocoled antibiotic treatment.

### News, views, and reviews. less may be more for MRSA: the latest on antibiotics, the utility of packing an abscess, and decolonization strategies [^5cda8467]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

The management of skin infections has evolved over time and new evidence suggests that less acute intervention may be as good or better. For acute treatment, evidence from the emergency medicine literature shows that empiric oral antibiotics may not improve outcomes relative to incision and drainage alone. The use of packing material for wounds after draining does not lead to a decreased rate of recurrence, more rapid healing, or fewer physician visits, but does cause more pain. For patients with multiple or recurrent skin and soft tissue infections, a comprehensive decolonization or eradication strategy is the most effective at preventing further recurrences. Several decolonization approaches exist and can be tailored to find the most appropriate for a particular individual.

### Treatments for breast abscesses in breastfeeding women [^9e1ce11a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The benefits of breastfeeding are well known, and the World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life and continuing breastfeeding to age two. However, many women stop breastfeeding due to lactational breast abscesses. A breast abscess is a localised accumulation of infected fluid in breast tissue. Abscesses are commonly treated with antibiotics, incision and drainage (I&D) or ultrasound-guided needle aspiration, but there is no consensus on the optimal treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different treatments for the management of breast abscesses in breastfeeding women.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trial Register (27 February 2015). In addition we searched African Journals Online (27 February 2015), Google Scholar (27 February 2015), ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Databases (27 February 2015) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal (27 February 2015). We also checked reference lists of retrieved studies and contacted experts in the field as well as relevant pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating any intervention for treating lactational breast abscesses compared with any other intervention. Studies published in abstract form, quasi-RCTs and cluster-RCTs were not eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy.

Main Results

We included six studies. Overall, trials had an unclear risk of bias for most domains due to poor reporting. Two studies did not stratify data for lactational and non-lactational breast abscesses, and these studies do not contribute to the results. This review is based on data from four studies involving 325 women. Needle aspiration (with and without ultrasound guidance) versus incision and drainage (I&D) Mean time (days) to complete resolution of breast abscess (three studies) - there was substantial heterogeneity among these data (τ² = 47.63, I² = 97%) and a clear difference between subgroups (with or without ultrasound guidance; χ² = 56.88, I² = 98.2%, P = < 0.00001). We did not pool these data in a meta-analysis. Two studies excluded women who had treatment failure when they calculated the mean time to complete resolution. One study found that the time to complete resolution of breast abscess favoured needle aspiration over I&D (mean difference (MD) -6.07; 95% confidence interval (CI) -7.81 to -4.33; n = 36), but excluded 9/22 (41%) women in the needle aspiration group due to treatment failure. Another study reported faster resolution in the needle aspiration group (MD -17.80; 95% CI -21.27 to -14.33; n = 64) but excluded 6/35 (17%) women in the needle aspiration group due to treatment failure. A third study also reported that needle aspiration was associated with a shorter time to complete resolution of breast abscess (MD -16.00; 95%CI -18.73 to -13.27; n = 60); however, the authors did not indicate the number of women who were lost to follow-up for either group, and it is unclear how many women contributed to this result. Considering the limitations of the available data, we do not consider the results to be informative. Continuation of breastfeeding, after treatment (success): results favoured the needle aspiration group, but we did not pool data from the two studies because of substantial unexplained heterogeneity (I(2) = 97%). One study reported that women in the needle aspiration group were more likely to continue breastfeeding (risk ratio (RR) 2.89; 95% CI 1.64 to 5.08; n = 60), whereas the other study found no clear difference (RR 1.09; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.22 n = 70). Treatment failure was more common among women treated with needle aspiration compared to those who underwent I&D (RR 16.12; 95% CI 2.21 to 117.73; two studies, n = 115, low quality evidence). In one study, treatment with needle aspiration failed in 9/22 women who subsequently underwent I&D to treat their breast abscess. In another study, treatment with needle aspiration failed in 6/35 women, who subsequently underwent I&D. All abscesses in the I&D group were successfully treated. The included studies provided limited data for the review's secondary outcomes. No data were reported for adverse events. One study (60 women) reported that women in the needle aspiration group were more satisfied with their treatment than women who received I&D to treat their breast abscesses. Incision and drainage (I&D) with or without antibioticsOne study (150 women) compared the value of adding a broad-spectrum cephalosporin (single dose or a course of treatment) to women who underwent I&D for breast abscesses. The mean time to resolution of breast abscess was reported as being similar in all groups (although women with infection were excluded). Mean time to resolution for women who received a course of antibiotics was reported as 7.3 days, 6.9 days for women who received a single dose of antibiotics and 7.4 days for women who did not receive antibiotics. Standard deviations, P values and CIs were not reported and prevented further analysis. No data were reported for any continuation of breastfeeding after treatment (success). For treatment failure, there was no clear difference between the groups of women who received antibiotics (either a single dose or a course of antibiotics) and those who did not (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.36 to 2.76). Included studies rarely reported this review's secondary outcomes (including adverse events). For post-operative complications/morbidity, there was no difference in the risk of wound infections between the antibiotics and no antibiotics groups (RR 0.58; 95% CI 0.29 to 1.17), irrespective of whether women received a single dose or a course of antibiotics.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to determine whether needle aspiration is a more effective option to I&D for lactational breast abscesses, or whether an antibiotic should be routinely added to women undergoing I&D for lactational breast abscesses. We graded the evidence for the primary outcome of treatment failure as low quality, with downgrading based on including small studies with few events and unclear risk of bias.

### Diagnosis and management of cellulitis and abscess in the emergency department setting: an evidence-based review [^c86d6864]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cellulitis and abscess are a common reason for presentation to the emergency department, although there are several nuances to the care of these patients.

Objective

The purpose of this narrative review article was to provide a summary of the background, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of cellulitis and abscesses with a focus on emergency clinicians.

Discussion

The most common bacteria causing cellulitis are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and other β-hemolytic streptococci, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus is most common in abscesses. The history and physical examination are helpful in differentiating cellulitis and abscess in many cases, and point-of-care ultrasound can be a useful tool in unclear cases. Treatment for cellulitis typically involves a penicillin or cephalosporin, and treatment of abscesses is incision and drainage. Loop drainage is preferred over the traditional incision and drainage technique, and adjunctive antibiotics can be considered. Most patients can be managed as outpatient.

Conclusions

It is essential for emergency physicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of patients with cellulitis and abscess.

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^9de8b8a0]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Identifying the infecting pathogen may not be necessary for treating uncomplicated skin abscesses, but cultures can provide helpful information in patients with recurrent abscesses or systemic illness. The most common pathogens are Staphylococcus aureus, most often methicillin-resistant (MRSA), and several other bacteria, most originating from the skin flora.MRSA accounts for a substantial number of visits by patients with skin and soft tissue infections.

Table 1 summarises current management guidelines, which do not recommend antibiotics for uncomplicated skin abscesses.

How the recommendation was created

The scope of the recommendation and the outcomes important to patients were defined by an international guideline panel consisting of two adults with lived experience of skin abscesses, one adult with lived experience as a carer for a child with skin abscess, five general practitioners, three paediatric or adult infectious disease physicians, four general internists, a general paediatrician, a dermatologist, and several health research methodologists. They requested a systematic review on the benefits and harms of different antibiotics to inform the recommendation. The panel then met online to discuss the evidence and to formulate specific recommendations. As with all BMJ Rapid Recommendations, no panel member had financial conflicts of interest; intellectual and professional conflicts were minimised and managed (see appendix 1 on bmj.com).

The panel followed the BMJ Rapid Recommendations procedures for creating a trustworthy recommendation, including using the GRADE approach to critically appraise the evidence and to move from evidence to recommendations (appendix 2 on bmj.com). The panel initially identified patient-important outcomes and subgroup hypotheses needed to inform the recommendation. When creating the recommendation, the panel considered the balance of benefits, harms, costs, burdens of the treatments, the quality of evidence for each outcome, typical patient values and preferences and their expected variations, as well as acceptability. Recommendations can be strong or weak, for or against a course of action. The recommendations take a patient-centred perspective which de-emphasises public health, societal, and health payer point of view.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^73fb6948]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is the appropriate treatment of complex abscesses (perianal and perirectal, and abscesses in intravenous drug injection sites)?

Complex skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage. We recommend antibiotic therapy if systemic signs of infection are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or in cases of abscess with significant cellulitis (recommendation 1C).

We recommend empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with coverage of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria (recommendation 1C).

Common sites of origin of complex abscesses may be perineal or perianal, perirectal, and abscesses at intravenous drug injection sites. Complicated skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage with adjuvant antibiotic therapy.

Perianal and perirectal abscesses originate most often from an obstructed anal crypt gland, with the resultant pus collecting in the subcutaneous tissue, intersphincteric plane, or beyond (ischiorectal space or supralevator space) where various types of anorectal abscesses form. Once diagnosed, anorectal abscesses should be promptly drained surgically. An undrained anorectal abscess can continue to expand into adjacent spaces as well as progress to generalized systemic infection. Anorectal abscess occurs more often in males than females. Most patients present between the ages of 20 to 60 with the mean age of 40 in both sexes.

The diagnosis of anorectal abscess is usually based on the patient's history and physical examination. The most common symptom of anorectal abscess is pain. As such, it has to be differentiated from other causes of anal pain including anal fissure, thrombosed hemorrhoids, levator spasm, sexually transmitted diseases, proctitis, and cancer. Low (intersphincteric, perianal, and ischiorectal) abscesses are usually associated with swelling, cellulites, and exquisite tenderness, but few systemic symptoms. High (submucosal, supralevator) abscesses may have few local symptoms, but significant systemic symptoms. Deeper abscesses, such as those that form in the supralevator or high ischiorectal space, may also present with pain referred to the perineum, low back, or buttocks.

Recurrent skin abscesses — appropriate treatment includes the following recommendations: A recurrent abscess at a site of previous infection should prompt a search for local causes such as a pilonidal cyst, hidradenitis suppurativa, or foreign material (strong, moderate). Recurrent abscesses should be drained and cultured early in the course of infection (strong, moderate). Culture recurrent abscess and treat with a 5- to 10-day course of an antibiotic active against the pathogen isolated (weak, low). Consider a 5-day decolonization regimen twice daily of intranasal mupirocin, daily chlorhexidine washes, and daily decontamination of personal items such as towels, sheets, and clothes for recurrent S. aureus infection (weak, low). Adult patients should be evaluated for neutrophil disorders if recurrent abscesses began in early childhood (strong, moderate).

Image-guided drainage of abscesses and fluid collections is a valuable tool in the treatment of pediatric patients. It may obviate surgery or optimize the child's clinical condition for subsequent surgery. Compared with adults, several differences exist in terms of etiology, risks (especially radiation exposure), preprocedural imaging and planning, technical considerations, support issues such as sedation, and complications. Knowledge of these differences is important in the planning and treatment of these patients. In addition, a quality improvement plan can be used to assess practice performance.

Understanding the recommendation

Absolute benefits and harms

The infographic provides an overview of the recommendations and the absolute benefits and harms of different antibiotics. Estimates of the baseline risk for side effects are derived from the control groups of the trials in the systematic review. Detailed information can also be viewed through MAGICapp, including consultation decision aids designed to support shared decision making with patients.

This clinical practice guideline is applicable to patients with uncomplicated skin abscesses, which means that it is not applicable to patients with evidence of systemic illness (such as sepsis), deep tissue infections, superficial infections (such as pustules and papules), hidradenitis suppurativa, or immunocompromising conditions, and patients who do not undergo incision and drainage.

The first recommendation relates to the usefulness of adjuvant TMP-SMX or clindamycin compared with no antibiotics in addition to incision and drainage. The effects of other antibiotics are speculative, except for cephalosporins, which are probably less effective or not effective (see evidence summary for recommendation No 2). Compared with no antibiotics, TMP-SMX or clindamycin reduces the absolute risk of treatment failure by approximately 5% at one month (high quality evidence). In patients who were cured, these antibiotics reduced the absolute risk of recurrence at three months by approximately 8% (high quality evidence). When considering both treatment failure and abscess recurrence, antibiotic therapy thus provides an approximate 13% reduction (high quality evidence). TMP-SMX or clindamycin probably provides a modest reduction in pain (tenderness) during treatment (7% fewer), and a small reduction in hospitalisation (2% fewer) and in similar infections among household contacts (2% fewer) (all moderate quality evidence). Considering the characteristics of involved patients and medical conditions may differ between emergency departments and general practices, antibiotics may confer an even smaller benefit in patients who present to their GP. Antibiotics probably do not reduce the risk of serious or invasive infections or death (moderate quality evidence).

### Systemic antibiotics for symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess in adults [^56ad092a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Dental pain can have a considerable detrimental effect on an individual's quality of life. Symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess are common causes of dental pain and arise from an inflamed or necrotic dental pulp, or infection of the pulpless root canal system. Clinical guidelines recommend that the first-line treatment for teeth with symptomatic apical periodontitis or an acute apical abscess should be removal of the source of inflammation or infection by local, operative measures, and that systemic antibiotics are currently only recommended for situations where there is evidence of spreading infection (cellulitis, lymph node involvement, diffuse swelling) or systemic involvement (fever, malaise). Despite this, there is evidence that dentists continue to prescribe antibiotics for these conditions. There is concern that this could contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial colonies both within the individual and within the community as a whole.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of systemic antibiotics provided with or without surgical intervention (such as extraction, incision and drainage of a swelling or endodontic treatment), with or without analgesics, for symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 1 October 2013); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 9); MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 1 October 2013); EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 1 October 2013) and CINAHL via EBSCO (1980 to 1 October 2013). We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Trials Registry Platform and the US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) on 1 October 2013 to identify ongoing trials. We searched for grey literature using OpenGrey (to 1 October 2013) and ZETOC Conference Proceedings (1993 to 1 October 2013). We placed no restrictions on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of systemic antibiotics in adults with a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess, with or without surgical intervention (considered in this situation to be extraction, incision and drainage or endodontic treatment) and with or without analgesics.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened the results of the searches against inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed risk of bias independently and in duplicate. We calculated mean differences (MD) (standardised mean difference (SMD) when different scales were reported) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous data and, where results were meta-analysed, we used a fixed-effect model as there were fewer than four studies. We contacted study authors to obtain missing information.

Main Results

We included two trials in this review, with 62 participants included in the analyses. Both trials were conducted in university dental schools in the USA and compared the effects of oral penicillin V potassium (penicillin VK) versus a matched placebo given in conjunction with a surgical intervention (total or partial pulpectomy) and analgesics to adults with acute apical abscess or symptomatic necrotic tooth (no signs of spreading infection or systemic involvement (fever, malaise)). We assessed one study as having a high risk of bias and the other study as having unclear risk of bias. The primary outcome variables presented were participant-reported pain and swelling (one trial also reported participant-reported percussion pain). One study reported the type and number of analgesics taken by participants. One study recorded the incidence of postoperative endodontic flare-ups (people who returned with symptoms that necessitated further treatment). Adverse effects as reported in one study were diarrhoea (one participant, placebo group) and fatigue and reduced energy postoperatively (one participant, antibiotic group). No studies reporting quality of life measurements were suitable for inclusion. Objective 1: systemic antibiotics versus placebo with surgical intervention and analgesics for symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess. Two studies provided data for the comparison between systemic antibiotics (penicillin VK) and a matched placebo for adults with acute apical abscess or a symptomatic necrotic tooth. Participants in one study all underwent a total pulpectomy of the affected tooth while participants in the other study had their tooth treated by either partial or total pulpectomy. Participants in both trials received oral analgesics. There were no statistically significant differences in participant-reported measures of pain or swelling at any of the time points assessed within the review. The MD for pain (short ordinal numerical scale 0 to 3) was -0.03 (95% CI -0.53 to 0.47) at 24 hours; 0.32 (95% CI -0.22 to 0.86) at 48 hours and 0.08 (95% CI -0.38 to 0.54) at 72 hours. The SMD for swelling was 0.27 (95% CI -0.23 to 0.78) at 24 hours; 0.04 (95% CI -0.47 to 0.55) at 48 hours and 0.02 (95% CI -0.49 to 0.52) at 72 hours. The body of evidence was assessed as at very low quality. Objective 2: systemic antibiotics without surgical intervention for adults with symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess. We found no studies that compared the effects of systemic antibiotics with a matched placebo delivered without a surgical intervention for symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess in adults.

Authors' Conclusions

There is very low quality evidence that is insufficient to determine the effects of systemic antibiotics on adults with symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess.

### Systemic antibiotics for the treatment of Skin and Soft tissue abscesses: a Systematic Review and meta-analysis [^da4a44ed]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

The addition of antibiotics to standard incision and drainage is controversial, with earlier studies demonstrating no significant benefit. However, 2 large, multicenter trials have recently been published that have challenged the previous literature. The goal of this review was to determine whether systemic antibiotics for abscesses after incision and drainage improve cure rates.

Methods

PubMed, the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Scopus, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and bibliographies of selected articles were assessed for all randomized controlled trials comparing adjuvant antibiotics with placebo in the treatment of drained abscesses, with an outcome of treatment failure assessed within 21 days. Data were dual extracted into a predefined worksheet and quality analysis was performed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.

Results

Four studies (n = 2,406 participants) were identified. There were 89 treatment failures (7.7%) in the antibiotic group and 150 (16.1%) in the placebo group. The calculated risk difference was 7.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.8% to 12.1%), with an odds ratio for clinical cure of 2.32 (95% CI 1.75 to 3.08) in favor of the antibiotic group. There was also a decreased incidence of new lesions in the antibiotic group (risk difference -10.0%, 95% CI -12.8% to -7.2%; odds ratio 0.32, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.44), with a minimally increased risk of minor adverse events (risk difference 4.4%, 95% CI 1.0% to 7.8%; odds ratio 1.29, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.58).

Conclusion

The use of systemic antibiotics for skin and soft tissue abscesses after incision and drainage resulted in an increased rate of clinical cure. Providers should consider the use of antibiotics while balancing the risk of adverse events.

What you need to know

For uncomplicated skin abscesses, we suggest using trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or clindamycin in addition to incision and drainage rather than incision and drainage alone, and emphasise the need for shared decision making
TMP-SMX or clindamycin modestly reduces pain and treatment failure and probably reduces abscess recurrence, but increases the risk of adverse effects including nausea and diarrhoea
We suggest TMP-SMX rather than clindamycin because TMP-SMX has a lower risk of diarrhoea
Cephalosporins in addition to incision and drainage are probably not more effective than incision and drainage alone in most settings
From a societal perspective, the modest benefits from adjuvant antibiotics may not outweigh the harms from increased antimicrobial resistance in the community, although this is speculative

### Percutaneous abscess drainage: update [^f17d8cce]. World Journal of Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

During the approximately 20 years that percutaneous abscess drainage (PAD) has been an extant procedure and as the millennium begins, PAD has become, by consensus, the treatment of choice for abscesses. Indications for PAD continue to expand, and currently almost all abscesses are considered amenable. On occasion, PAD is an adjunctive procedure that provides a beneficial temporizing effect for the surgeon who eventually must operate for a coexisting problem such as a bowel leak. Simple unilocular abscesses are cured almost uniformly by PAD; more complicated abscesses, such as those with enteric fistulas (e.g., diverticular abscess) or pancreatic abscesses, have cure rates ranging from 65% to 90%. Various catheters and insertion techniques have proven effective. Ultrasonography, computed tomography, and fluoroscopy are the staple modalities that guide PAD. PAD is the prototype interventional radiology procedure, providing detection of the abscess by imaging, needling for diagnosis, and catheterization for therapy.

### Determinants of treatment and outcomes of diverticular abscesses [^bb379e41]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Diverticular disease of the colon is a common ailment, especially among the elderly, present in approximately 65% of the population over 65 years of age. However, only 5% of the patients with diverticular disease develop an acute diverticulitis during their lifetimes. Most of the episodes of acute diverticulitis are uncomplicated, but 15–20% of those diagnosed with computed tomography (CT) imaging are complicated by an intra-abdominal abscess. Due to their rarity, the treatment of diverticular abscesses is not based on high-quality evidence.

Abscess size of 3–6 cm is generally accepted as a reasonable cutoff determining the choice of treatment. World Society of Emergency Surgery guidelines recommend antibiotics alone for abscesses with a diameter less than 4–5 cm. Some studies have suggested that the smallest abscesses might be safely treated with only oral antibiotic in an outpatient setting or possibly even without antibiotics. Percutaneous drainage of the abscess combined with intravenous antibiotics is recommended for larger abscesses, but the evidence to support this is of low quality. No randomized controlled trials comparing the treatment of diverticular abscesses using drainage with antibiotics to antibiotics alone exist. However, data from retrospective series suggest an approximately 20% failure rate for both drainage with antibiotics and antibiotics alone. Emergency surgery is usually reserved for unstable patients or patients not responding to conservative treatment as it is associated with higher mortality (12% vs. 1.1% if treated non-operatively). However, this excess mortality might be more due to the selection bias and unmodifiable factors (sepsis or comorbidities) than the surgery itself. The aim of this study was to analyze the treatment choices and their outcomes for diverticular abscesses of different sizes.

The evidence

To inform the recommendations, the guideline panel requested a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of adjuvant antibiotic therapy compared with no antibiotic therapy in addition to incision and drainage in patients with uncomplicated skin abscesses.

A large RCT published in March 2016 suggested that TMP-SMX treatment resulted in a higher cure rate than placebo among patients with a drained cutaneous abscess. Another RCT published in June 2017 found that, compared with incision and drainage alone, clindamycin or TMP-SMX in addition to incision and drainage improved short term outcomes in patients who had an uncomplicated skin abscess. The Rapid Recommendations team believed these two trials, in addition to the existing body of evidence, might change practice.

Figure 1 gives an overview of the characteristics of patients and trials included in the systematic review of the effects of antibiotics on uncomplicated skin abscesses. There were 14 RCTs: eight included a comparison of antibiotics versus no antibiotics, and seven included a comparison of two different antibiotics. Explicit descriptions of abscess definitions, for each trial, were summarised in the accompanying systematic review (table C of appendix 2). The largest trial specifically focused on small abscesses (all < 5 cm diameter and about half ≤ 2 cm) in patients who had no signs of systemic infection. The RCTs included participants with skin abscesses anywhere on the body.

Fig 1
Characteristics of patients and trials included in systematic review of the effects of antibiotics on uncomplicated skin abscesses. (MRSA = meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; MSSA = meticillin susceptible S aureus)

Eleven trials reported study setting, of which nine were conducted in emergency departments, one in outpatient dermatology clinics, and one in an Integrated Soft Tissue Infection Services (ISIS) clinic involving patients with high rates of comorbidity, such as infection with hepatitis C, hepatitis B, or HIV. The RCTs included children and adults. Almost all patients underwent incision and drainage for their skin abscess. The most common pathogen was MRSA (49–88%) followed by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, 9–18%).

In conclusion, CT, MRI, and EUS could have a role in the diagnosis of perianal abscesses, with the principal aims of excluding related conditions and correctly determining the regional anatomy and extent of the disease; the choice of the appropriate imaging investigation should take into account multiple factors, such as patient's past medical history, clinical presentation, local availability of resources, and skills. After the resolution of the acute phase, routine imaging after incision and drainage of the anorectal abscess is usually not required. An imaging follow-up is otherwise suggested in cases of recurrence, in the presence of suspected IBD and when there is evidence of a fistula and/or non-healing wound.

1.C - In patients with an anorectal abscess, what are the indications for surgical treatment and what is the appropriate timing for surgery?

In patients with anorectal abscess, we recommend a surgical approach with incision and drainage (strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C).

In patients with anorectal abscess, we suggest to base the timing of surgery on the presence and severity of sepsis (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

In fit, immunocompetent patients with a small perianal abscess and without systemic signs of sepsis we suggest considering an outpatient management (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

The primary treatment of anorectal abscesses remains surgical drainage, with the timing being dictated by the severity and nature of any sepsis. In general, the incision should be kept as close as possible to the anal verge to minimize the length of a potential fistula, while still providing adequate drainage and avoiding sphincteral damage. It is important to stress the high rate of recurrence after drainage, which can be as high as 44%. The risk factors associated with recurrence are inadequate drainage, loculations, horseshoe-type abscess, and time from disease onset to incision. The high recurrence rate and the associated risk factors emphasize the need for a complete and accurate drainage of the abscess. A recent randomized prospective study on needle aspiration treatment vs. incision and drainage of acute simple perianal abscess emphasized the importance of a complete drainage of the perianal abscess, with recurrence rates of 41% following needle aspiration compared to 15% after incision and drainage.

### Primary closure of cutaneous abscesses: a systematic review [^9071fad3]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Cutaneous abscesses have traditionally been treated with incision and drainage followed by secondary healing. Primary closure after incision and drainage is an alternative mode of therapy practiced in some parts of the world. The current study reviews the experience with primary closure of abscesses.

Methods

A systematic literature review was conducted using search terms abscess and primary closure. The databases searched included MEDLINE, PubMED, EMBASE, CINHAL, and the Cochrane Library between 1950 and 2009. The reference lists of the retrieved studies were also manually searched for additional studies. We performed a meta-analysis of all randomized clinical trials in which patients were randomized to either primary or secondary closure of incised and drained abscesses using Review Manager software.

Results

Of 33 articles retrieved, there were 7 randomized controlled trials in which 915 patients were randomized to primary (n = 455) or secondary (n = 460) closure. Many abscesses were located in the anogenital region and drained by surgeons. The time to healing after primary closure (7.8 days [95% confidence interval {CI}, 7.3–8.3]) was significantly shorter than that after secondary closure (15.0 days [95% CI, 14.3–15.7]; absolute difference, 7.3 days [95% CI, 6.9–7.6]). The rates of abscess recurrence after primary closure (7.6% [95% CI, 4.6–10.6]) were similar to those after secondary closure (11.1 days [95% CI, 7.5–14.7]; odds ratio, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.35–1.15]).

Conclusions

Studies from 4 countries suggest that primary closure of incised and drained abscesses results in faster healing and similar low abscess recurrence rates than after secondary closure. These studies provide a foundation for which clinical trials can be conducted in the United States.

### Systemic antibiotics after incision and drainage of simple abscesses: a meta-analysis [^e6992c8e]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Over the last decade, there has been a significant increase in the number of cutaneous abscesses. While there is general agreement that abscesses should be treated with incision and drainage, it is unclear whether systemic antibiotics should be routinely prescribed.

Objective

To evaluate whether systemic antibiotics, when compared with a placebo, improve cure rates in patients with simple abscesses after incision and drainage.

Methods Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis using RevMan5.

Patients and Settings

Children and adults with simple abscesses treated in outpatient clinics or emergency departments.

Data Sources

Cochrane Central, Medline, Embase and bibliographies.

Outcome Measures

Percentage of patients with complete resolution of abscess without the need for recurrent incision and drainage, additional antibiotics, or hospital admission within 7-10days of treatment.

Results

We included four trials, consisting of 589 patients in total (428 adults and 161 children). Patients were randomised to one of three antibiotics (cephridine (27), cephalexin (82), or trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole (161)) or to placebo (285), with 34 lost to follow-up or having incomplete data. When given in addition to incision and drainage, systemic antibiotics did not significantly improve the percentage of patients with complete resolution of their abscesses 7-10days after treatment (88.1% vs 86.0%; OR 1.17 (95% CI 0.70 to 1.95)).

Conclusions

When given in addition to incision and drainage, systemic antibiotics do not significantly improve the percentage of patients with complete resolution of their abscesses.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^d6a675bb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is the appropriate treatment of superficial infections (impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis, and superficial abscesses)?

We recommend that impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis should be managed by antibiotics against Gram-positive bacteria (recommendation 1C).

Empiric therapy for community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA or who do not respond to first line therapy (recommendation 1C).

Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for simple abscesses or boils. We recommend not to use antibiotics for simple abscesses or boils (recommendation 1C).

Superficial infections encompass either superficial spreading infection and inflammation within the epidermis and dermis that may be treated with antibiotics alone or a well-circumscribed abscess that may be treated by drainage alone.

Physical examination usually reveals erythema, tenderness, and induration. The majority of superficial SSTIs are caused by Gram-positive bacteria, particularly streptococci and S. aureus. The three common presentations of superficial infections consist of impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis. They are managed by antibiotic therapy against Gram-positive bacteria.

Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the superficial layers of the epidermis. Impetigo predominantly affects children, and it is one of the most common SSTI in children worldwide. It is characterized by discrete purulent lesions nearly always caused by β-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. and/or S. aureus. Moreover, of particular concern is the rising role of CA-MRSA as impetigo's etiological agent.

Erysipelas is a fiery red, tender, painful plaque with well-demarcated edges and is commonly caused by streptococcal species, usually Staphylococcus pyogenes. S. aureus rarely causes erysipelas. Streptococci are the primary cause of erysipelas. Most facial infections are attributed to group A Streptococcus (GAS), with an increasing percentage of lower extremity infections being caused by non-GAS. The role of S. aureus, and specifically MRSA, remains controversial.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^3d0a1b53]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn's disease intra-abdominal abscess — management and outcomes are summarized as follows: Patients with CD who develop an abdominal abscess should undergo a surgical resection, although some may respond to medical therapy after radiologically guided drainage. In a meta-analysis of 9 studies including 513 patients with spontaneous intra-abdominal abscesses, the overall complication rate was higher in patients who underwent initial surgery compared with those who first underwent percutaneous drainage of the abscess (OR 0.58; 95% CI 0.35–0.96; P = 0.03), and the risk for recurrent abscess was higher in patients who underwent percutaneous drainage alone than those who underwent surgery (OR 2.16; 95% CI 1.03–4.54; P = 0.04). After drainage, most patients benefit from a delayed surgical resection, though some may benefit from drainage followed by CD medical treatment, especially those with a new diagnosis and absence of stricturing disease; to date, there are no studies comparing percutaneous drainage followed by delayed intestinal resection vs medical therapy.

### Systemic antibiotics for symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess in adults [^fafc9a00]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Dental pain can have a detrimental effect on quality of life. Symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess are common causes of dental pain and arise from an inflamed or necrotic dental pulp, or infection of the pulpless root canal system. Clinical guidelines recommend that the first-line treatment for teeth with these conditions should be removal of the source of inflammation or infection by local, operative measures, and that systemic antibiotics are currently only recommended for situations where there is evidence of spreading infection (cellulitis, lymph node involvement, diffuse swelling) or systemic involvement (fever, malaise). Despite this, there is evidence that dentists frequently prescribe antibiotics in the absence of these signs. There is concern that this could contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial colonies within both the individual and the community. This review is an update of the original version that was published in 2014.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of systemic antibiotics provided with or without surgical intervention (such as extraction, incision and drainage of a swelling, or endodontic treatment), with or without analgesics, for symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess in adults.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 26 February 2018), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 1) in the Cochrane Library (searched 26 February 2018), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 26 February 2018), Embase Ovid (1980 to 26 February 2018), and CINAHL EBSCO (1937 to 26 February 2018). The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. A grey literature search was conducted using OpenGrey (to 26 February 2018) and ZETOC Conference Proceedings (1993 to 26 February 2018). No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of systemic antibiotics in adults with a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess, with or without surgical intervention (considered in this situation to be extraction, incision and drainage or endodontic treatment) and with or without analgesics.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors screened the results of the searches against inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed risk of bias independently and in duplicate. We calculated mean differences (MD) (standardised mean difference (SMD) when different scales were reported) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous data. A fixed-effect model was used in the meta-analysis as there were fewer than four studies. We contacted study authors to obtain missing information.

Main Results

We included two trials in this review, with 62 participants included in the analyses. Both trials were conducted in university dental schools in the USA and compared the effects of oral penicillin V potassium (penicillin VK) versus a matched placebo when provided in conjunction with a surgical intervention (total or partial pulpectomy) and analgesics to adults with acute apical abscess or symptomatic necrotic tooth. The patients included in these trials had no signs of spreading infection or systemic involvement (fever, malaise). We assessed one study as having a high risk of bias and the other study as having unclear risk of bias. The primary outcome variables reported in both studies were participant-reported pain and swelling (one trial also reported participant-reported percussion pain). One study reported the type and number of analgesics taken by participants. One study recorded the incidence of postoperative endodontic flare-ups (people who returned with symptoms that necessitated further treatment). Adverse effects, as reported in one study, were diarrhoea (one participant, placebo group) and fatigue and reduced energy postoperatively (one participant, antibiotic group). Neither study reported quality of life measurements. Objective 1: systemic antibiotics versus placebo with surgical intervention and analgesics for symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscessTwo studies provided data for the comparison between systemic antibiotics (penicillin VK) and a matched placebo for adults with acute apical abscess or a symptomatic necrotic tooth when provided in conjunction with a surgical intervention. Participants in one study all underwent a total pulpectomy of the affected tooth, while participants in the other study had their tooth treated by either partial or total pulpectomy. Participants in both trials received oral analgesics. There were no statistically significant differences in participant-reported measures of pain or swelling at any of the time points assessed within the review. The MD for pain (short ordinal numerical scale 0 to 3) was -0.03 (95% CI -0.53 to 0.47) at 24 hours; 0.32 (95% CI -0.22 to 0.86) at 48 hours; and 0.08 (95% CI -0.38 to 0.54) at 72 hours. The SMD for swelling was 0.27 (95% CI -0.23 to 0.78) at 24 hours; 0.04 (95% CI -0.47 to 0.55) at 48 hours; and 0.02 (95% CI -0.49 to 0.52) at 72 hours. The body of evidence was assessed as at very low quality. Objective 2: systemic antibiotics without surgical intervention for adults with symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscessWe found no studies that compared the effects of systemic antibiotics with a matched placebo delivered without a surgical intervention for symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess in adults.

Authors' Conclusions

There is very low-quality evidence that is insufficient to determine the effects of systemic antibiotics on adults with symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess.

### Antibiotics for uncomplicated skin abscesses after incision… [^f6f850dc]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- TMP-SMX or clindamycin can be combined with incision and drainage of skin abscesses to decrease the risk of treatment failure and recurrence.
- TMP-SMX is weakly recommended over clindamycin because of its lower risk of diarrhea.
- Cephalosporins are not likely to have reduced rates of treatment failure compared with incision and drainage alone. Staphylococcus aureus). Current clinical guidelines recommend against the use of antibiotics for uncomplicated lesions after incision and drainage. Recently, however, a collaboration between the BMJ and the MAGIC group led an international panel made up of a variety of health care professionals and adults with experience treating and living with skin abscesses to create recommendations regarding antibiotic use based on identified benefits, harms, cost, treatment burden, evidence quality, and patient preferences.

Recommendations Based on high-quality evidence, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or clindamycin combined with incision and drainage has been shown to decrease the risk of treatment failure by approximately 5% at one month and the risk of recurrence by approximately 8% at three months compared with no antibiotic treatment. TMPSMX and clindamycin also are associated with decreases in pain, hospitalizations, and infections in household contacts based on moderate-quality evidence. There is no crucial difference in treatment failure between TMP-SMX and clindamycin, and both have similar risk of recurrence. TMP-SMX is typically taken twice per day, and clindamycin is taken three or four times per day; both are often combined with over-the-counter pain medication. TMP-SMX is usually inexpensive, whereas clindamycin can be expensive in some areas. However, both are available by prescription or over the counter in many countries.

Using the GRADE framework, the panel gave a weak recommendation in favor of TMP-SMX over clindamycin. Either agent is recommended over incision and drainage alone. This decision should be made in conjunction with the patient to ensure that the option chosen is in line with what the patient determines is most important with regard to desirable outcomes and undesirable consequences. Patients who prefer to avoid recurrence may opt to take clindamycin, whereas those who prefer avoiding diarrhea may select TMP-SMX. Although cephalosporins or other antibiotics are often prescribed for skin abscesses, in most circumstances, including settings with high rates of methicillin-resistant.

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^ab27a038]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Current understanding

A skin abscess is an isolated collection of pus within the dermis and deeper skin tissues. Uncomplicated skin abscesses are collections of pus within the skin structures and are usually caused by bacterial infections. Careful history and clinical examination are usually sufficient to diagnose a skin abscess. Skin abscesses present as single or multiple tender, erythematous, indurated nodules, often surrounded by an area of erythema or swelling. Fluctuance beneath the skin often indicates a fluid filled cavity. There may be a pustule at the area where the abscess is closest to the skin or spontaneous drainage of pus. The use of point-of-care ultrasonography can help differentiate an abscess from other soft tissue infections in the emergency department.

Skin infections are common. More than 4% of people seek treatment for skin infections annually in the United States. In European countries, it may be less common: in Belgium and the Netherlands about 0.5–0.6% visit their general practitioner with bacterial skin infections each year.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^b5e6bc29]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The goal of surgical therapy of an abscess is to drain the abscess expeditiously, identify a fistula tract, and either proceed with primary fistulotomy to prevent recurrence or place a draining seton for future consideration.

A large abscess should be drained with multiple counter incisions rather than a long incision, which will create a step-off deformity and delay wound healing.

Complicated abscesses may involve a variety of pathogens and are frequently polymicrobial in origin.

Although most cases can be managed by incision and drainage, abscesses in injecting drug users require special considerations as compared to soft-tissue infections, which are not caused by intravenous drug abuse. There are two main sources of organisms: the injecting drug users themselves (their oropharynx, skin, or feces), and the environment. Contamination may occur when the user prepares or injects the drug, uses shared needles, or re-uses injection paraphernalia. Manufacturing and handling of injectable drugs may be far from hygienic rules. Persistent signs of systemic infection require evaluation for the presence of endocarditis. Foreign bodies, such as broken needles, should be ruled out by radiography, and duplex sonography should be performed to identify the presence of vascular complications. Viral (HIV, HCV, HBV) acute or chronic infections should be always ruled out. Broad-spectrum antibiotics effective against aerobic and anaerobic organisms should be administered in patients with these infections. Broad-spectrum agents with coverage of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic pathogens may be required depending on the clinical setting. Given the high frequency of MRSA in some areas, this pathogen should be empirically covered if it is suspected, but no randomized studies are available for the treatment of SSTI specifically caused by CA-MRSA.

### Subgroup analysis of antibiotic treatment for skin Abscesses [^2b816fe0]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Two large randomized trials recently demonstrated efficacy of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-active antibiotics for drained skin abscesses. We determine whether outcome advantages observed in one trial exist across lesion sizes and among subgroups with and without guideline-recommended antibiotic indications.

Methods

We conducted a planned subgroup analysis of a double-blind, randomized trial at 5 US emergency departments, demonstrating superiority of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (320/1,600 mg twice daily for 7 days) compared with placebo for patients older than 12 years with a drained skin abscess. We determined between-group differences in rates of clinical (no new antibiotics) and composite cure (no new antibiotics or drainage) through 7 to 14 and 42 to 56 days after treatment among subgroups with and without abscess cavity or erythema diameter greater than or equal to 5 cm, history of MRSA, fever, diabetes, and comorbidities. We also evaluated treatment effect by lesion size and culture result.

Results

Among 1,057 mostly adult participants, median abscess cavity and erythema diameters were 2.5 cm (range 0.1 to 16.0 cm) and 6.5 cm (range 1.0 to 38.5), respectively; 44.3% grew MRSA. Overall, for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and placebo groups, clinical cure rate at 7 to 14 days was 92.9% and 85.7%; composite cure rate at 7 to 14 days was 86.5% and 74.3%, and at 42 to 56 days, it was 82.4% and 70.2%. For all outcomes, across lesion sizes and among subgroups with and without guideline antibiotic criteria, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with improved outcomes. Treatment effect was greatest with history of MRSA infection, fever, and positive MRSA culture.

Conclusion

Treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with improved outcomes regardless of lesion size or guideline antibiotic criteria.

Measures of treatment effect

We will perform statistical analysis in accordance with the guidelines in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We will analyse the data using an intention‐to‐treat model as discussed above.

We will express dichotomous data as the numbers of events in the control and intervention groups of each study and calculate Mantel‐Haenszel odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). An increase in the odds of a particular outcome will be displayed graphically in the meta‐analyses to the right of the centre line, and a decrease in the odds of an outcome will be displayed graphically to the left of the centre line.

For continuous data (e.g. length of hospital stay), if all studies report the same outcomes, we will calculate the mean difference (MD) between treatment groups. If similar outcomes are reported on different scales, we will calculate the standardised mean difference (SMD). We will reverse the direction of effect of individual studies, if required, to ensure consistency across trials. We will present 95% CIs for all outcomes.

We will use time‐to‐event data to capture the mortality rate and recurrence rate as reported by the study authors.

Unit of analysis issues

The primary analysis will be per woman randomised. If we encounter any cluster‐randomised or multi‐arm trials, we will analyse the data according to the advice set out in Chapter 23 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. For cluster‐randomised trials, we will estimate the intracluster (or intraclass) correlation coefficient (ICC), either by obtaining this information from the trial data or by using an external estimate based on a similar study. We will obtain statistical support to assist us with this process. For multi‐arm studies, our approach will be to combine groups to create a single pair‐wise comparison, and we will seek statistical support with regard to the correct approach for assessing heterogeneity in this instance, depending on the specific data.

We may also choose to summarise data that did not allow valid analysis (e.g. descriptive data) in additional tables and will exclude this from meta‐analysis.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of left-sided colonic diverticulitis [^4f7677ec]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2020). High credibility.

American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) guideline — management of diverticular abscess: Image-guided percutaneous drainage is usually recommended for stable patients with abscesses > 3 cm in size (Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B). Complicated diverticulitis with abscess formation occurs in 15% to 40% of patients who present with acute sigmoid diverticulitis, and nonoperative treatment with either antibiotics alone or with percutaneous drainage is successful in up to 80% of cases. Treatment failure is typically defined as requiring surgery, developing worsening sepsis, or having a recurrent abscess within 30 days. Antibiotic treatment alone for abscesses smaller than 3 cm is typically successful and, in stable patients, treatment can usually be administered in the outpatient setting; however, for larger abscesses (> 3 cm) antibiotics alone have a much higher failure rate (up to 34%). Although recurrence after antibiotic treatment ranges from 25% to 60% of patients, recurrence after percutaneous drainage is significantly lower (15%–25%). Patients without a safe access window for percutaneous drainage or who do not respond to medical treatment including percutaneous drainage should typically be considered for surgery, and laparoscopic abscess drainage rather than surgical resection can be considered in certain cases.

Background

A perianal abscess is a collection of pus under the skin, around the anus. It usually occurs due to an infection of an anal gland. In the UK, the annual incidence is 40 per 100,000 of the adult population, and the standard treatment is admission to hospital for incision and drainage under general anaesthetic. Following drainage of the pus, an internal dressing (pack) is placed into the cavity to stop bleeding. Common practice is for community nursing teams to change the pack regularly until the cavity heals. Some practitioners in the USA and Australia make a small stab incision under local anaesthetic and place a catheter into the cavity which drains into an external dressing. It is removed when it stops draining. Elsewhere in the USA, simple drainage is performed in an outpatient setting under local anaesthetic.

Objectives

To assess the effects of internal dressings in healing wound cavities resulting from drainage of perianal abscesses.

Search Methods

In May 2016 we searched: The Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trial registries to identify ongoing and unpublished studies, and searched reference lists of relevant reports to identify additional studies. We did not restrict studies with respect to language, date of publication, or study setting.

Selection Criteria

Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any type of internal dressing (packing) used in the post-operative management of perianal abscess cavities with alternative treatments or different types of internal dressing.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction.

Main Results

We included two studies, with a total of 64 randomised participants (50 and 14 participants) aged 18 years or over, with a perianal abscess. In both studies, participants were enrolled on the first post-operative day and randomised to continued packing by community district nursing teams or to no packing. Participants in the non-packing group managed their own wounds in the community and used absorbant dressings to cover the area. Fortnightly follow-up was undertaken until the cavity closed and the skin re-epithelialised, which constituted healing. For non-attenders, telephone follow-up was conducted. Both studies were at high risk of bias due to risk of attrition, performance and detection bias. It was not possible to pool the two studies for the outcome of time to healing. It is unclear whether continued post-operative packing of the cavity of perianal abscesses affects time to complete healing. One study reported a mean time to wound healing of 26.8 days (95% confidence interval (CI) 22.7 to 30.7) in the packing group and 19.5 days (95% CI 13.6 to 25.4) in the non-packing group (it was not clear if all participants healed). We re-analysed the data and found no clear difference in the time to healing (7.30 days longer in the packing group, 95% CI -2.24 to 16.84; 14 participants). This was assessed as very low quality evidence (downgraded three levels for very serious imprecision and serious risk of bias). The second study reported a median time to complete wound healing of 24.5 days (range 10 to 150 days) in the packing group and 21 days (range 8 to 90 days) in the non-packed group. There was insufficient information to be able to recreate the analysis and the original analysis was inappropriate (did not account for censoring). This second study also provided very low quality evidence (downgraded four levels for serious risk of bias, serious indirectness and very serious imprecision). There was very low quality evidence (downgraded for risk of bias, indirectness and imprecision) of no difference in wound pain scores at the initial dressing change. Both studies also reported patients' retrospective judgement of wound pain over the preceding two weeks (visual analogue scale, VAS) as lower for the non-packed group (2; both studies) compared with the packed group (0; both studies); (very low quality evidence) but we have been unable to reproduce these analyses as no variance data were published. There was no clear evidence of a difference in the number of post-operative fistulae detected between the packed and non-packed groups (risk ratio (RR) 2.31, 95% CIs 0.56 to 9.45, I² = 0%) (very low quality evidence downgraded three levels for very serious imprecision and serious risk of bias). There was no clear evidence of a difference in the number of abscess recurrences between the packed and non-packed groups over the variable follow-up periods (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.37, I² = 0%) (very low quality evidence downgraded three levels for serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision). No study reported participant health-related quality of life/health status, incontinence rates, time to return to work or normal function, resource use in terms of number of dressing changes or visits to a nurse, or change in wound size.

Authors' Conclusions

It is unclear whether using internal dressings (packing) for the healing of perianal abscess cavities influences time to healing, wound pain, development of fistulae, abscess recurrence or other outcomes. Despite this absence of evidence, the practice of packing abscess cavities is commonplace. Given the lack of high quality evidence, decisions to pack may be based on local practices or patient preferences. Further clinical research is needed to assess the effects and patient experience of packing.

Fig 1
Barriers to effective antibiotic treatment of liver abscesses caused by hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKp). 1. Limited tissue penetration: For the treatment of KLAs, parenteral antibiotics are typically prescribed for rapid delivery to the bloodstream. However, there is limited blood supply to the abscesses, and so the antibiotic must travel from the bloodstream through the liver tissue and into the abscess. While antibiotics are in the bloodstream, they bind to plasma proteins. Different classes of antibiotic bind plasma protein to varying degrees, and only the unbound fractions can effectively penetrate tissue. Highly protein-bound antibiotics (such as third generation cephalosporins) penetrate tissues at a much slower rate than antibiotics with lower protein binding (such as fluoroquinolones and some carbapenems). 2. Abscess penetration: Abscess maturity and antibiotic lipophilicity determine the extent of antibiotic penetration through the abscess wall. Lipophilic (lipid soluble) antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones and macrolides are more effective at crossing the fibrous abscess wall than hydrophilic drugs like cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. 3. Abscess environment: Stresses encountered in the abscess environment, such as nutrient and oxygen deprivation, reactive oxygen or nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), and low pH are known to coerce bacteria into a low metabolic state, which increases tolerance to antibiotics. The extent to which these stresses contribute to treatment failure of KLAs has not been experimentally determined. 4. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR): The acquisition of genes or genetic mutations which confer resistance by hvKp reduces the repertoire of available antibiotics, limiting treatment options and increasing the risk of severe, recalcitrant infections.

### Multicentre study of non-surgical management of diverticulitis with abscess formation [^783c1a91]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

The rates of adverse and unwanted outcomes in patients with diverticular abscess remain high and present a major burden to the patient, as well the healthcare system. Therefore, an aim of the present study was to identify potential risk factors related to these adverse outcomes in order to help improve individual patient management. Abscess size was shown to be an independent predictor of adverse outcome; an abscess diameter of at least 3 cm increased the risk of short‐term treatment failure, whereas an abscess of 5 cm or larger increased the risk of emergency surgery. These results indicate that, for abscesses larger than 3 cm, and particularly those larger than 5 cm, it can still be debated which treatment strategy is most appropriate, as the results show no definite advantage of one strategy over the other in short‐term outcomes. Treatment should not be based solely on abscess size, but other patient and disease characteristics should also be considered. However, no other significant predictors were found in the multivariable analyses for treatment failure or emergency surgery, making it difficult to select a subpopulation of patients who would benefit from PCD. The findings do seem to acknowledge that a cut‐off value of 3 cm is appropriate for differentiating between small and large abscesses 11, 13, 17, 29, 30.

### Effectiveness of outpatient antibiotics after surgical drainage of abscesses in reducing treatment failure [^1fa502a8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal approach to outpatient antibiotic use after surgical drainage of abscesses is unclear given conflicting clinical trial results.

Objective

Our primary objective was to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of outpatient antibiotic prescribing after surgical drainage of cutaneous abscesses on reducing treatment failure.

Methods

We performed a retrospective observational study using data extracted from the electronic health record of a single academic health care system. All emergency department (ED) visits that resulted in discharge with a surgical drainage of a cutaneous abscess procedure code were included in the sample. All visits were categorized into having received or not having received an antibiotic prescription at the index visit. Outcome frequencies were compared using Pearson's chi-squared test. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to estimate the odds of treatment failure among those who did and did not receive an antibiotic prescription at their index ED visit.

Results

The final sample consisted of 421 index ED visits, of which 303 (72%) received an antibiotic prescription. Treatment with antibiotics after drainage did not significantly reduce the odds of composite treatment failure within 30 days when controlling for sociodemographic and clinical encounter variables (odds ratio 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.23–1.21).

Conclusions

This real-world, comparative effectiveness analysis did not demonstrate any significant reduction in treatment failure with the use of antibiotics after drainage of abscesses in the ED. It is unclear if the clinical benefit observed under controlled trial conditions will carry over to routine clinical practice where varied antibiotic regimens are the norm and local bacterial resistance patterns vary.

### Abscess management: an evidence-based review for emergency medicine clinicians [^7a762148]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Abscesses are commonly evaluated and managed in the emergency department. Recent research has evaluated the use of ultrasonography, packing, incision and drainage (I&D), and antibiotics. There are evidence-based nuances to the management of specific types of abscesses, such as Bartholin, breast, dental, hidradenitis suppurativa, peritonsillar, and pilonidal abscesses.

Objective

This review provides emergency medicine clinicians with a summary of the current literature regarding abscess management in the emergency department.

Discussion

Ultrasound is valuable in diagnosing abscesses that are not clinically evident and in guiding I&D procedures. Although I&D is traditionally followed by packing, this practice may be unnecessary for small abscesses. Antibiotics, needle aspiration, and loop drainage are suitable alternatives to I&D of abscesses with certain characteristics. Oral antibiotics can improve outcomes after I&D, although this improvement must be weighed against potential risks. Many strategies are useful in managing Bartholin abscesses, with the Word catheter proving consistently effective. Needle aspiration is the recommended first-line therapy for small breast abscesses. Dental abscesses are often diagnosed with clinical examination alone, but ultrasound may be a useful adjunct. Acute abscess formation caused by hidradenitis suppurativa should be managed surgically by excision when possible, because I&D has a high rate of abscess recurrence. Peritonsillar abscesses can be diagnosed with either intraoral or transcervical ultrasound if clinical examination is inconclusive. Needle aspiration and I&D are both suitable for the management of peritonsillar abscesses. Pilonidal abscesses have traditionally been managed with I&D, but needle aspiration with antibiotics may be a suitable alternative.

Conclusions

This review evaluates the recent literature surrounding abscess management for emergency medicine clinicians.

### Loop drainage is noninferior to traditional incision and drainage of cutaneous abscesses in the emergency department [^ae60f08c]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

There is limited research on loop drainage (LD) compared to incision and drainage (I&D) for treatment of cutaneous abscesses. We investigated whether LD was noninferior to I&D for abscess resolution and whether there was any difference in repeat ED visits or complication rates between these techniques.

Methods

We performed a prospective randomized controlled trial, using a convenience sample at an urban academic emergency department (ED). Subjects over 18 years who presented for first-time management of an abscess were eligible. Patients requiring specialist drainage or hospital admission or had previous treatment for the abscess were excluded. Enrolled subjects were seen 2 weeks after treatment for blinded reevaluation of abscess resolution, and the electronic medical record was reviewed for return ED visits/abscess complications.

Results

Of 2,889 patients screened, 238 subjects consented and were randomized to LD or I&D. Abscess resolution was achieved in 53/65 (81.5%) of patients in the I&D arm, compared to 66/75 (88%) in the LD arm. Fewer patients in the LD group compared to the I&D group returned to the ED for abscess-related management during the following 14 days (37.3% vs 67.1%, p = 0.002). Among returning subjects, there was a significant difference in mean visits per subject between LD and I&D groups (0.5 vs. 1.2, p = 0.001). There were fewer complications among LD than I&D subjects (9.3% vs. 24.6%, p = 0.01).

Conclusion

Our study provides evidence that LD is noninferior to I&D in achieving complete abscess resolution at 14 days and is associated with fewer return ED visits and fewer complications. This makes it an attractive alternative treatment option for abscesses.

### Determinants of treatment and outcomes of diverticular abscesses [^0caa8974]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Abscess size has a drastic effect on the choice and success of treatment of diverticular abscesses. Abscesses under 40 mm were mostly treated with only antibiotics with a high success rate (87%). This reflects current international guidelines for the treatment of small diverticular abscesses. Patients with an abscess larger than 80 mm often had conditions requiring immediate surgery, such as peritonitis or free air in CT scan, and surgery was the most common first-line treatment (43%) in this group. Half of those, who were initially treated conservatively, required surgery within 30 days. Percutaneous drainage was attempted for 35% of patients with abscess ≥ 40 mm, who did not undergo surgery as the first-line treatment. However, due to technical difficulties, only 18% were successfully drained. Treatment with antibiotics alone decreased as abscess size increased.

### Abscess on the nasal tip of a young woman [^43814e46]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What is the most appropriate next step in management?
A. Incision and drainage of the patient's lesion and treating her partner with penicillin
B. Empiric treatment with oral terbinafine and obtaining a fungal culture
C. Treating the patient with topical mupirocin ointment and warm compresses
D. Performing a biopsy of the lesion and sending tissue for histopathologic examination
E. Treating the patient with oral clindamycin for gram-positive coverage

Answers:
A. Incision and drainage of the patient's lesion and treating her partner with penicillin – Correct. Abscesses caused by GBS often require incision and drainage, as antibiotics alone may not suffice. Additionally, the patient's partner is an asymptomatic carrier likely reinfecting the patient, so penicillin treatment is appropriate.
B. Empiric treatment with oral terbinafine and obtaining a fungal culture – Incorrect. Although fungal infections can present as refractory nodules, the culture results showing beta-hemolytic, Christie-Atkins-Munch-Petersen-positive gram-positive cocci strongly indicate a bacterial, not fungal, etiology. Oral terbinafine is not warranted here.
C. Treating the patient with topical mupirocin ointment and warm compresses – Incorrect. While topical antibiotics can be effective for superficial bacterial infections, this patient's chronic and refractory nodule suggests a deeper infection requiring more invasive management, such as incision and drainage and systemic antibiotic therapy.
D. Performing a biopsy of the lesion and sending tissue for histopathologic examination – Incorrect. A biopsy could be considered if there was suspicion of an atypical lesion (eg, malignancy or granulomatous infection). However, in this case, the diagnosis is clear based on the culture and clinical features, making biopsy unnecessary as the first-line step.
E. Treating the patient with oral clindamycin for gram-positive coverage – Incorrect. Although clindamycin provides effective gram-positive coverage, incision and drainage is critical in managing abscesses. Treating the partner is also essential to prevent reinfection, which clindamycin alone does not address.

Perianal abscess — assessment and treatment algorithm begins with assessment of intestinal disease with history and physical, colonoscopy to evaluate rectal inflammation, perianal assessment to examine for pain, fluctuance, erythema, and digital rectal exam for stricture; if pain, fluctuance or stricture is present, perform EUA ± EUS or MRI pelvis, whereas absence of pain, fluctuation or stricture leads to proceed to perianal fistula algorithm. For superficial abscess, management includes incision and drainage and, if associated with low perianal fistula, a noncutting seton may be placed, plus antibiotics; for deep abscess, use incision and drainage and antibiotics. If a high perianal fistula is identified, place a noncutting seton, and if a perianal fistula is not identified, place a mushroom catheter; provide antibiotics for cellulitis if present and treat intestinal disease with Anti-TNFα, Azathioprine/6MP, and Methotrexate.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^60f646c9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2014 SSTI guideline — cutaneous abscess and inflamed epidermoid cyst management emphasizes that aspiration was successful in only 25% of cases overall and < 10% with MRSA infections, and accordingly, this form of treatment is not recommended. Simply covering the surgical site with a dry dressing is usually the easiest and most effective treatment of the wound, and one small study found that packing caused more pain and did not improve healing when compared to just covering the incision site with sterile gauze. The addition of systemic antibiotics to incision and drainage of cutaneous abscesses does not improve cure rates, even in those due to MRSA, but systemic antibiotics should be given to patients with severely impaired host defenses or signs or symptoms of systemic infection; multiple abscesses, extremes of age, and lack of response to incision and drainage alone are additional settings in which systemic antimicrobial therapy should be considered.

Penetrating Crohn's disease with abscess — antibiotics, percutaneous drainage (PD), and surgery: Patients with penetrating Crohn's disease with abscess formation may be managed with antibiotics with or without drainage followed by interval elective resection or medical therapy depending on the clinical situation and patient preferences (Weak recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 2B). Smaller abscesses (< 3 cm) can generally be treated with antibiotics alone, whereas larger abscesses are typically treated with antibiotics and PD. Successful PD, defined as abscess resolution and avoidance of subsequent surgery, occurs in 23% to 78% of patients; abscess recurrence is significantly higher after PD alone versus surgical intervention (OR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.03–4.54; p = 0.04), and factors associated with PD failure include concomitant steroid use, colonic disease, and large, multiloculated, or multifocal abscesses. Preoperative PD combined with antibiotics typically improves postoperative outcomes and shortens length of stay; in a meta-analysis of 513 patients with spontaneous abscesses, postoperative complications were significantly lower with PD followed by surgery versus surgery at presentation (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.23–0.83; p = 0.03).

### Drainage sufficient treatment for smaller uncomplicated… [^bb52f7c6]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

The incision and drainage technique has historically been the standard of care for skin abscesses. However, because of concerns about community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, antibiotic therapy is often added to incision and drainage for abscess management, even though it is unknown whether it improves clinical outcomes. Duong and colleagues evaluated the effectiveness of antibiotics versus placebo in the treatment of abscesses after incision and drainage. The Study: The authors evaluated 149 children three months to 18 years of age who presented with a skin abscess. Following incision and drainage, probing for loculations, and wound culturing, patients were randomized to receive placebo or a 10-day course of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.

Patients were told not to use topical antiseptics or antibiotics at home to avoid potential confounding factors, and were reevaluated 10 and 90 days later for signs of recurrence. Treatment failure was defined as worsening signs or symptoms, or presence of persistent cellulitis or abscess at the 10-day follow-up visit. Results: Mean abscess diameter before incision and drainage was 2. 2 ±

1. 5 cm as determined by ultrasonography. Community-acquired MRSA accounted for 80 percent of culture-isolated bacteria; however, all isolates were sensitive to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Adverse effect rates were similar between the groups, with no serious effects reported. Conclusion: The authors conclude that adding antibiotic therapy to incision and drainage does not improve abscess resolution rates more than incision and drainage alone among children, even when MRSA is the responsible organism.

editor's note: A study of adults with uncomplicated abscesses also reported that antibiotics did not improve cure rates beyond incision and drainage alone — although the authors reported that 87. 8 percent of cases were caused by MRSA and cephalexin was used.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^2e3c2781]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Simple abscesses

7) Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for simple abscesses or boils. Antibiotics are not needed (Recommendation 1 C).

Complex abscesses

8) Complex skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage. Antimicrobial therapy is required if systemic signs of sepsis are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or for the abscesses with significant cellulitis (Recommendation 1 C).

9) Empiric antibiotic therapy should be directed toward the likely pathogens involved.

Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA (Recommendation 1 C).

10) Inadequate resolution should prompt consideration of further drainage, resistant pathogens, or host immune failure (Recommendation 1 C).

Diagnosis of necrotizing soft tissue infections

11) A rapidly progressive soft tissue infection should be always treated aggressively as a necrotizing soft tissue infection (Recommendation 1 C)

12) Both CT and MRI may be useful for diagnosing necrotizing soft tissue infections. However MRI may be difficult to perform under emergency situations. (Recommendation 2 C).

13) In unstable patients, ultrasound may be useful to differentiate simple cellulitis from necrotizing fasciitis (Recommendation 2 C).

Management of patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections

14) Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock caused by NSTI require early source control, antimicrobial therapy, and supportive treatment (Recommendation 1 C).

Source control in patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections

15) Surgical source control must be early and aggressive to halt progression of the inflammatory process caused by NSTI (Recommendation 1 C).

Hyperbaric oxygen in patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections

16) Although the benefit of adjuvant hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy remains controversial, it may be considered where it is available (Recommendation 2 C).

### Irrigation of cutaneous abscesses does not improve treatment success [^6956a36c]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Irrigation of the cutaneous abscess cavity is often described as a standard part of incision and drainage despite no randomized, controlled studies showing benefit. Our goal is to determine whether irrigation of a cutaneous abscess during incision and drainage in the emergency department (ED) decreases the need for further intervention within 30 days compared with no irrigation.

Methods

We performed a single-center, prospective, randomized, nonblinded study of ED patients receiving an incision and drainage for cutaneous abscess, randomized to irrigation or no irrigation. Patient characteristics and postprocedure pain visual analog scale score were obtained. Thirty-day telephone follow-up was conducted with a standardized data form examining need for further intervention, which was defined as repeated incision and drainage, antibiotic change, or abscess-related hospital admission.

Results

Of 209 enrolled patients, 187 completed follow-up. The irrigation and no-irrigation groups were similar with respect to diabetes, immunocompromise, fever, abscess size, cellulitis, and abscess location, but the irrigation group was younger (mean age 36 versus 40 years) and more often treated with packing (89% versus 75%) and outpatient antibiotics (91% versus 73%). The need for further intervention was not different in the irrigation (15%) and no-irrigation (13%) groups (difference 2%; 95% confidence interval -8% to 12%). There was no difference in pain visual analog scale scores (5.6 versus 5.7; difference 0.1; 95% confidence interval -0.7 to 0.9).

Conclusion

Although there were baseline differences between groups, irrigation of the abscess cavity during incision and drainage did not decrease the need for further intervention.

### Interventions in addition to broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic therapy for the treatment of radiologically proven tubo-ovarian abscess [^be8aa326]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

The domains of bias that will be addressed are as follows.

Bias arising from the randomisation process, for example, alternate randomisation or other methodology which allows the future knowledge or prediction of assignments.
Bias due to deviation from intended intervention. As the main effect of interest is assignment to the intervention, we will consider there to have been deviations from the intended intervention within a study if they are inconsistent with trial protocol, arise because of the experimental context, or influence the outcome. There are unlikely to be any non‐protocol interventions received by participants that would affect the outcome of interest, but we will reassess this for each included study. We will assess the role of blinding for each included study at the level of participants, carers, and people delivering the interventions.
Bias due to missing outcome data, including methods used to account for missing data within studies. We will consider both the true value of the outcomes for participants with missing data and the likely underlying cause that led to the missing outcome data, and whether these are related, to help us assess the likelihood of bias in this domain.
Bias in measurement of outcome – this will include assessment of whether the method of measuring the outcome is appropriate, whether this method is the same across intervention groups, who is measuring the outcome data and whether they are blind to the intervention assignment, and whether the outcome assessment could be influenced by the knowledge of the intervention received.
Bias in selection of the reported results – we will assess this by obtaining the prespecified analysis intentions for each trial and comparing these to the actual analysis. Where this is not possible, we will assess the methodology section and compare it to the results. We will cross‐compare outcome measures and analyses for all papers relating to a trial.

Authors will utilise signalling questions as outlined by Cochrane to indicate a judgement of 'low risk of bias', 'some concerns', or 'high risk of bias' for each included study, in each of the above domains and then overall. We will exclude from the analysis any studies which are at high risk of bias.

If we encounter cluster‐randomised trials, we will analyse these using the ROB 2 guidance and template specific to cluster‐randomised trials.

We will resolve any disagreement by discussion, or by involving a third review author (MB).
