## Question

Sodium correction for hyponatremia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about sodium correction for hyponatremia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why hyponatremia matters. Then, I should verify how to classify severity and acuity. Next, I will review the competing risks of under-correction versus over-correction. After that, I need to reconcile evolving evidence with established guidelines. Then, I will outline practical, risk-stratified correction targets and monitoring. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a balanced, actionable approach with explicit caveats and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why this matters. Hyponatremia is common, associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and presents a classic therapeutic dilemma: treat too slowly and cerebral edema may progress; treat too fast and osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) can occur, so I need to keep both poles in view as I proceed [^90dd948b] [^19dbc176].

> I will now examine severity and acuity because these drive urgency and correction limits. Severe hyponatremia is typically defined as serum sodium less than 120–125 mEq/L, and acuity matters because brain adaptation differs: acute onset within 48 hours carries a higher risk of cerebral edema, whereas chronic hyponatremia beyond 48 hours carries a higher risk of ODS if corrected too rapidly, so I should confirm duration whenever possible before committing to a correction plan [^90dd948b] [^1438df03].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about speed. I need to balance the risks. Under-correction leaves patients vulnerable to seizures, herniation, and respiratory arrest from cerebral edema, whereas over-correction risks ODS with permanent neurologic injury; historically, ODS risk rises with correction exceeding about 8–12 mEq/L in 24 hours, especially in chronic, profound hyponatremia with additional risk factors, so I should verify patient-specific risk before choosing a correction cadence [^90dd948b] [^694c3309].

> Next, I should review the evolving evidence that challenges slower correction. Recent observational cohorts and a 2025 meta-analysis suggest that faster correction of severe hyponatremia is associated with lower in-hospital and 30-day mortality and shorter length of stay, without a clear increase in ODS, but wait, let me verify the limitations: these are nonrandomized, confounded by indication, and ODS is rare and may be under-ascertained, so causality remains uncertain and I should be cautious about overgeneralization [^7a0afd8d] [^13f68a53] [^04815900].

> I should double-check how this squares with guidelines. Major society guidance still recommends conservative limits: 8–10 mEq/L in 24 hours for most, 4–6 mEq/L in 24 hours for high-risk patients, and a hard ceiling of 18 mEq/L in 48 hours; these limits are rooted in physiologic rationale and historical ODS cases, and given the observational nature of the newer mortality data, many experts advise maintaining safeguards rather than abandoning them [^939d0f17] [^cf662663] [^8c9ce4c2].

> Let me think about a pragmatic, risk-stratified approach. For severely symptomatic patients with seizures, coma, or respiratory compromise, I should treat as an emergency with 3% hypertonic saline boluses to raise sodium by about 4–6 mEq/L rapidly, then pause and reassess; this addresses cerebral edema while buying time to confirm chronicity and implement controlled correction thereafter, and I need to ensure frequent sodium checks during active correction [^90dd948b] [^5f4beb21].

> For chronic severe hyponatremia without life-threatening symptoms, I should confirm a slower correction target. In average-risk patients, aiming for 6–8 mEq/L in 24 hours with an absolute cap of 10–12 mEq/L in 24 hours and 18 mEq/L in 48 hours is reasonable; in high-risk patients (sodium ≤ 105 mEq/L, alcohol use disorder, malnutrition, hypokalemia, or advanced liver disease), I should target 4–6 mEq/L in 24 hours and not exceed 8 mEq/L in 24 hours, and I should plan to monitor sodium every 4–6 hours initially to catch overshoot early [^939d0f17] [^cf662663] [^925c56ff].

> Wait, let me verify strategies to prevent overcorrection. The most common driver of unintended rapid rises is a sudden water diuresis after the underlying cause resolves; proactively using desmopressin to clamp urine output, or being ready to relower sodium with D5W and desmopressin if limits are exceeded, reduces overshoot risk and is endorsed by guidelines and observational strategies, so I should have a low threshold to deploy these in high-risk patients [^6051a4e3] [^1eea8c2b] [^493a79da].

> I need to ensure I account for special populations. In cirrhosis, both EASL and AASLD recommend very conservative correction, typically 4–6 mEq/L in 24 hours and never more than 8 mEq/L in 24 hours, because ODS risk is magnified; in exercise-associated hyponatremia, rapid 3% saline boluses are first-line to reverse cerebral edema, with fluid restriction and avoidance of isotonic saline early in management; in chronic SIADH, urea or carefully monitored vaptans can be effective, but I should watch for overcorrection, especially with vaptans, and consider inpatient initiation with close monitoring [^47d93a6c] [^4b156e54] [^102f8b73] [^6605f4f3] [^d256080a].

> Hold on, I should verify monitoring cadence and safety nets. During active correction with hypertonic saline, measuring sodium every 4–6 hours is prudent, and I should track urine output because abrupt increases signal impending overcorrection; if the sodium rise exceeds the daily target, I should act immediately to slow or reverse it rather than hoping for the best, given the narrow therapeutic window in profound chronic hyponatremia [^925c56ff] [^5f4beb21].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line and explicitly state uncertainties. The balance of evidence shows that overly slow correction may be associated with worse outcomes in some cohorts, but rapid correction carries a small but catastrophic risk of ODS that cannot be reliably predicted in individual patients; until randomized trials resolve this, a risk-stratified, guideline-concordant approach with emergency reversal of severe symptoms followed by controlled, closely monitored correction remains the safest course, and I should document shared decision-making when deviating from conservative limits in exceptional circumstances [^7a0afd8d] [^04815900] [^939d0f17].

---

The safe correction of hyponatremia depends on symptom severity, chronicity, and risk factors for osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) [^90dd948b]. For **severe symptoms** (seizures, coma, or respiratory arrest), give 3% hypertonic saline in 100 mL boluses [^5f4beb21] to raise sodium by 4–6 mEq/L rapidly, then stop and reassess; do not exceed 10 mEq/L in 24 hours [^90dd948b]. For **chronic hyponatremia**, limit correction to 8 mEq/L in 24 hours (≤ 6 mEq/L if high risk) [^cf662663] and ≤ 18 mEq/L in 48 hours [^939d0f17]; monitor sodium every 4–6 hours and use desmopressin to prevent overcorrection [^fc1bb7cf]. If overcorrection occurs, promptly relower sodium with desmopressin and hypotonic fluids [^c2eeb022] [^5dbd5c7e]. Always tailor therapy to the cause and reassess frequently to balance the risks of cerebral edema and ODS [^90dd948b].

---

## Classification of hyponatremia

Hyponatremia is classified by **severity and chronicity** to guide urgency and correction targets:

| **Severity** | **Serum sodium (mmol/l)** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| Mild | 130–134 | Usually asymptomatic or mild symptoms |
| Moderate | 125–129 | Nausea, headache, confusion |
| Severe | < 125 | Seizures, coma, respiratory arrest |

---

Chronicity is defined as **acute (< 48 hours)** or **chronic (> 48 hours)** [^90dd948b]; chronic cases have a higher risk of ODS with rapid correction [^694c3309].

---

## General principles of sodium correction

- **Treat the underlying cause**: Address the cause (e.g. SIADH, hypovolemia, hypervolemia, endocrine disorders) [^90dd948b].
- **Balance risks**: Weigh cerebral edema from undercorrection against ODS from overcorrection [^861c01a9].
- **Monitor closely**: Frequent sodium checks and clinical reassessment are essential [^925c56ff].

---

## Correction rates based on clinical scenario

### Severe symptomatic hyponatremia (medical emergency)

In severe symptomatic hyponatremia, **immediate correction** is required to prevent brain herniation [^90dd948b]. Use 3% hypertonic saline in 100 mL boluses [^5f4beb21], repeated up to three times, targeting a 4–6 mEq/L rise [^90dd948b]. Do not exceed 10 mEq/L in 24 hours [^90dd948b]. Once symptoms improve, transition to slower correction and monitor sodium every 4–6 hours [^925c56ff].

---

### Chronic hyponatremia (asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic)

In chronic hyponatremia, **slow, controlled correction** is critical to avoid ODS [^861c01a9]. Limit correction to 8 mEq/L in 24 hours (≤ 6 mEq/L if high risk) [^cf662663] and ≤ 18 mEq/L in 48 hours [^939d0f17]. Monitor sodium every 4–6 hours and use desmopressin to prevent overcorrection [^fc1bb7cf].

---

### High-risk patients for osmotic demyelination syndrome

Certain patients are at **increased risk of ODS** and require stricter limits:

- **Severe hyponatremia**: ≤ 105 mmol/L [^cf662663].
- **Alcohol use disorder**: Chronic alcoholism [^cf662663].
- **Malnutrition**: Poor nutritional status [^cf662663].
- **Hypokalemia**: Low potassium [^cf662663].
- **Liver disease**: Advanced liver disease [^cf662663].

In these patients, **limit correction to 4–6 mEq/L in 24 hours** and avoid exceeding 8 mEq/L in 24 hours [^cf662663].

---

## Monitoring and prevention of overcorrection

- **Frequent monitoring**: Check sodium every 4–6 hours during active correction [^925c56ff].
- **Desmopressin**: Use proactively or reactively to prevent or halt overcorrection [^fc1bb7cf].
- **Relowering**: If overcorrection occurs, promptly relower sodium with desmopressin and hypotonic fluids (e.g. D5W) [^c2eeb022] [^5dbd5c7e].

---

## Special considerations

- **Exercise-associated hyponatremia**: Treat with 3% saline boluses; avoid isotonic fluids early [^102f8b73] [^6605f4f3].
- **Hypervolemic hyponatremia**: Use fluid restriction and treat the underlying cause; avoid hypertonic saline unless life-threatening [^de7550dd] [^4b156e54].
- **Hypovolemic hyponatremia**: Use isotonic saline to restore volume, then correct sodium slowly [^1438df03].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Initial correction target** | **Maximum correction in 24 hours** | **Maximum correction in 48 hours** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Severe symptomatic | 4–6 mEq/L rapidly | 10 mEq/L | 18 mEq/L |
| Chronic, average risk | 4–8 mEq/L | 8 mEq/L | 18 mEq/L |
| High risk for ODS | 4–6 mEq/L | 6 mEq/L | 8 mEq/L |

---

Safe correction of hyponatremia requires **individualized, closely monitored therapy** that balances the risks of cerebral edema and ODS [^90dd948b]. Use rapid correction only for severe symptoms, then transition to slow, controlled correction with frequent monitoring and desmopressin to prevent overcorrection [^5f4beb21] [^fc1bb7cf].

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^8c9ce4c2]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

International guidelines designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia have been widely accepted for a decade. On the basis of the results of a recent large retrospective study of patients hospitalized with hyponatremia, it has been suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of rise of the serum sodium concentration; the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration has been questioned. These assertions are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago. After reviewing the history of that controversy, the evidence supporting the guidelines, and the validity of data challenging them, we conclude that current safeguards should not be abandoned. To do so would be akin to discarding your umbrella because you remained dry in a rainstorm. The authors of this review, who represent 20 medical centers in nine countries, have all contributed significantly to the literature on the subject. We urge clinicians to continue to treat severe hyponatremia cautiously and to wait for better evidence before adopting less stringent therapeutic limits.

### Correction rates and clinical outcomes in hospitalized adults with severe hyponatremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^7a0afd8d]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Hyponatremia treatment guidelines recommend limiting the correction of severe hyponatremia during the first 24 hours to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). Recent evidence suggests that slower rates of correction are associated with increased mortality.

Objective

To evaluate the association of sodium correction rates with mortality among hospitalized adults with severe hyponatremia.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, LILACS, Web of Science, CINAHL, and international congress proceedings for studies published between January 2013 and October 2023.

Study Selection

Comparative studies assessing rapid (≥ 8–10 mEq/L per 24 hours) vs slow (< 8 or 6–10 mEq/L per 24 hours) and very slow (< 4–6 mEq/L per 24 hours) correction of severe hyponatremia (serum sodium < 120 mEq/L or < 125 mEq/L plus severe symptoms) in hospitalized patients.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Pairs of reviewers (N. A.F. J.R.M. J.M. A. A.C.) independently reviewed studies, extracted data, and assessed each included study's risk of bias using ROBINS-I. Cochrane methods, PRISMA reporting guidelines, and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to rate the certainty of evidence were followed. Data were pooled using a random-effects model.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes were in-hospital and 30-day mortality, and secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay (LOS) and ODS.

Results

Sixteen cohort studies involving a total of 11 811 patients with severe hyponatremia were included (mean [SD] age, 68.22 [6.88] years; 56.7% female across 15 studies reporting sex). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that rapid correction was associated with 32 (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.55–0.82) and 221 (odds ratio, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.11–0.79) fewer in-hospital deaths per 1000 treated patients compared with slow and very slow correction, respectively. Low-certainty evidence suggested that rapid correction was associated with 61 (risk ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.45–0.67) and 134 (risk ratio, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.28–0.44) fewer deaths per 1000 treated patients at 30 days and with a reduction in LOS of 1.20 (95% CI, 0.51–1.89) and 3.09 (95% CI, 1.21–4.94) days, compared with slow and very slow correction, respectively. Rapid correction was not associated with a statistically significant increased risk of ODS.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, slow correction and very slow correction of severe hyponatremia were associated with an increased risk of mortality and hospital LOS compared to rapid correction.

### The challenge of hyponatremia [^e98ac58b]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia often challenges clinicians on many counts. Despite similar serum sodium concentrations, clinical manifestations can range from mild to life threatening. Some patients require active management, whereas others recover without intervention. Therapeutic measures frequently yield safe correction, yet the same measures can result in osmotic demyelination. To address this challenge, we present a practical approach to managing hyponatremia that centers on two elements: a diagnostic evaluation directed at the pathogenesis and putative causes of hyponatremia, the case-specific clinical and laboratory features, and the associated clinical risk; and a management plan tailored to the diagnostic findings that incorporates quantitative projections of fluid therapy and fluid losses on the patient's serum sodium, balances potential benefits and risks, and emphasizes vigilant monitoring. These principles should enable the clinician to formulate a management plan that addresses expeditiously three critical questions: Which of the determinants of the serum sodium are deranged and what is the underlying culprit? How urgent is the need for intervention? What specific therapy should be instituted and which are the associated pitfalls?

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^ecf0d2d2]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia is a common electrolyte disorder associated with significant complications and controversies regarding its optimal management. Clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements have attempted to provide clinicians with evidence-based diagnostic and treatment strategies for hyponatraemia. Recently published guidance documents differ in their methods employed to review the quality of available evidence. Nagler et al. used the Appraisal of Guideline for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument in a systematic review of guidelines and consensus statements for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia. Nagler and colleagues highlighted the variability in methodological rigour applied to guideline development and inconsistencies between publications in relation to management of hyponatraemia (including the recommended rate of correction of a low serum sodium concentration). These differences could cause confusion for practising physicians managing patients with hyponatraemia. Please see related article: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/12/231.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^1b780606]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For the past decade, most physicians treating severe hyponatremia have followed international guidelines that recommend limiting the rate of correction to avoid serious iatrogenic neurologic complications, most notably osmotic demyelination. Although these guidelines are based on small retrospective case series, they have been widely accepted by expert clinicians and are designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia. – Established practice has recently been challenged by the publication of a retrospective analysis of hospital administrative data derived from a cohort of over 17,000 patients hospitalized with hyponatremia. On the basis of the results of that study, an accompanying editorial suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of correction; its authors questioned the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration. We believe such conclusions are unwarranted and potentially dangerous; they are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago. A review of that controversy, and of how current guidelines came to be, will explain the reason for our position.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia [^12fc5713]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with severe (serum sodium ≤ 120 mEq/L), symptomatic hyponatremia can develop life-threatening or fatal complications from cerebral edema if treatment is inadequate and permanent neurologic disability from osmotic demyelination if treatment is excessive. Unfortunately, as is true of all electrolyte disturbances, there are no randomized trials to guide the treatment of this challenging disorder. Rather, therapeutic decisions rest on physiologic principles, animal models, observational studies, and single-patient reports. European guidelines and recommendations of an American Expert panel have come to similar conclusions on how much correction of hyponatremia is enough and how much is too much, but there are important differences. We review the evidence supporting these recommendations, identifying areas that rest on relatively solid ground and highlighting areas in greatest need of additional data.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: expert panel recommendations [^13e94bb6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious, but often overlooked, electrolyte imbalance that has been independently associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving many different body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of osmotically induced cerebral edema, and excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic impairment and death as a result of osmotic demyelination. The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose substantial challenges in managing this disorder. In 2007, a panel of experts in hyponatremia convened to develop the Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations that defined strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. In the 6 years since the publication of that document, the field has seen several notable developments, including new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients. Therefore, additional guidance was deemed necessary and a panel of hyponatremia experts (which included all of the original panel members) was convened to update the previous recommendations for optimal current management of this disorder. The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent recommended approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia that are based on both consensus opinions of experts in hyponatremia and the most recent published data in this field.

### Evaluation of serum sodium correction rates for management of hyponatremia in hospitalized patients [^45aa6020]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Appropriate correction of hyponatremia can reduce complications such as osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS).

Objective

To evaluate rates of serum sodium correction in hyponatremic hospitalized patients and identify factors associated with higher rates of overcorrection.

Methods

This is an institutional review board-approved single-center, retrospective chart review of patients ≥ 18 years of age with at least 1 serum sodium < 130 mEq/L during hospitalization. The primary end point was percentage of patients appropriately corrected for hyponatremia. Appropriate correction was defined as a sodium change ≤ 12 mEq/L over 24 hours and 18 mEq/L over 48 hours, and overcorrection was defined as an increase in serum sodium exceeding these cutoffs. Secondary end points included incidence of ODS, poor neurological outcome, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital lengths of stay (LOSs), and in-hospital mortality.

Results

Of 234 patients evaluated, 100 were included. Mean age was 72 ± 16 years, and 47% were male. Overcorrection occurred in 14 patients. There was no incidence of ODS. Rates of poor neurological outcome (P = 0.77), ICU (P = 0.09) and hospital LOS (P = 0.13), and in-hospital mortality (P = 0.20) were similar between appropriately corrected and overcorrected patients. Using a logistic regression analysis, severe hyponatremia (serum sodium < 120 mEq/L; P = 0.0122) and history of alcohol use disorder (P < 0.001) were risk factors found to be associated with overcorrection.

Conclusion and Relevance

Overcorrection of hyponatremia occurred in 14% of patients in this study. To minimize this risk, further caution should be taken when managing patients presenting with identified risk factors.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^c2eeb022]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Analytical limitations of serum sodium measurements must also be considered when setting correction goals and limits. Because of unavoidable imprecision, a laboratory report indicating that the serum sodium has increased by 8 mmol/L might, in reality, reflect an increase of 10 mmol/L. For that reason, when planning therapy, the targeted rate of correction should not be too close to rates that can result in patient harm.

Administration of desmopressin (a synthetic antidiuretic hormone) either after or in anticipation of a water diuresis has been used to reverse or prevent inadvertent excessive correction of hyponatremia. Both the European Clinical Practice Guidelines and the US/Irish expert panel suggest that relowering of the serum sodium should be considered if correction limits have been exceeded. However, the approach should depend on the relative risks of injury from excessive correction. The strongest case for relowering the serum sodium to prevent osmotic demyelination can be made in patients at very high risk of developing the disorder (those with a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L or patients with heavy alcohol use, severe hypokalemia, malnutrition, or advanced liver disease). It would be reasonable to relower the serum sodium in such patients if it has increased by > 8 mmol/L in < 24 hours. On the other hand, patients who have rapidly become hyponatremic due to self-induced water intoxication related to psychosis or endurance exercise often develop a spontaneous water diuresis that rapidly brings the serum sodium back to normal; because their risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome is extremely low, the US/Irish expert panel deemed efforts to prevent or reverse excessive correction to be unnecessary. Similarly, in most patients presenting with a sodium > 120 mmol/L, relowering the serum sodium after correction by > 8 mmol/L or even > 12 mmol/L was not recommended. In patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L without major risk factors for osmotic demyelination, initial correction by 8–12 mmol/L is more than necessary, but unlikely to be harmful unless the 48-hours limit of 18 mmol/L is exceeded; the panel deemed relowering of the serum sodium to be optional after correction by > 10–12 mmol/L but recommended that further increases in serum sodium should be avoided for the next 24 hours. Other experts have adopted the stricter limit of 8 mmol/L in 24 hours for all patients.

### Rate of correction and all-cause mortality in patients with severe hypernatremia [^541c761a]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Some of the rationale supporting current expert opinion recommending controlled correction of hypernatremia rests on a perceived symmetry with correction of hyponatremia. While it is appealing to group these 2 common sodium disorders together, published data do not support this approach. The evidence supporting slow correction of hyponatremia is supported by animal studies, numerous case reports and large observational studies. In contrast, there are no convincing reports of even 1 adult harmed by rapid correction of hypernatremia. From a physiological perspective the risk of neurological complications seems to be much higher with rapid correction of hyponatremia, as the adaptations of brain cells to hypernatremia are much slower than to hyponatremia. Also, while the risk of complication associated with rapid correction is more common with chronic hyponatremia compared with acute hyponatremia, chronic hypernatremia is considerably less common than acute hypernatremia. Our results were comparable for patients with hypernatremia on admission compared with those who were diagnosed during hospitalization, also supporting the safety of rapid correction of hypernatremia even when there is no clear documentation of an acute condition.

The 30-day mortality was alarmingly high in the reported cohort. This is in line with previous studies of severe hypernatremia. The absolute difference in survival between rapidly and slowly corrected patients was very large and remained so after adjustment for potential confounders. Interestingly, the size of the absolute difference in survival was comparable at 30 days and at 1 year following documentation of severe hypernatremia. This might suggest that the different mortality rates do not represent differences in the patient populations unaccounted by the statistical analysis, but rather the results of the treatment strategies for severe hypernatremia, namely the rate of correction. An additional support to this hypothesis is the strong correlation reported between the absolute sodium correction in the first 24 hours and patient survival. This implies that the high mortality rates known to be associated with severe hypernatremia might be partly attributed to lack of aggressive rehydration, which might improve patient outcomes.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^7d6a53a1]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypotonic hyponatraemia (serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L with low osmolality) is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalised adult patients. The diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia may be complex, costly, and controversial. Hyponatraemia has diverse aetiologies and is additionally defined clinically by its duration, "acute" (< 48 hours) versus "chronic" (> 48 hours), and by the presence or absence of symptoms. Management can be challenging particularly in the emergency setting where different treatment options may help or indeed harm individual patients. It is perhaps surprising that management of this electrolyte disorder has a limited evidence base in part due to the paucity of high quality randomised controlled trials. Multiple clinical practice and consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia have been published by local, national, and international organisations. These guidelines represent genuine efforts to address the diagnostic challenges and controversies in its management, particularly in relation to the rate of correction for the serum sodium concentration. The systematic review by Nagler et al. reviewing the quality of recent published guidelines and consensus statements for diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia, has highlighted important variations in both their development and recommendations.

### Criteria for hyponatremic overcorrection: systematic review and cohort study of emergently ill patients [^67d24404]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disturbance amongst hospitalized patients. An overly rapid rate of correction of chronic hyponatremia is believed to increase the risk of poor clinical outcomes including osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). There is disagreement in the literature regarding the definition of hyponatremic overcorrection.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of all English language studies to identify those that calculated sodium correction rate and classified patients' overcorrection status. We then identified all patients who presented to our hospital's emergency department between 2003 and 2015 with a corrected serum sodium ≤ 116 mmol/L. All methods from the systematic review for sodium correction rate calculation and overcorrection status were applied to this cohort.

Results

We identified 24 studies citing 9 distinct sodium correction rate methods and 14 criteria for overcorrection. Six hundred twenty-four patients presenting with severe hyponatremia (median initial value 113 mMol) were identified. Depending on the method used, the median sodium correction rates in our cohort ranged from 0.271 to 1.13 mmol/L per hour. The proportion of patients classified with overcorrection with the different criteria varied almost 11-fold, ranging from 8.5 to 89.9%.

Conclusion

Published methods disagree regarding the calculation of sodium correction rates and the definition of hyponatremic overcorrection. This leads to wide variations in sodium correction rates and the prevalence of overcorrection in patient cohorts. Definitions based on ODS risk are needed.

### Treatment of hyponatremia [^6e8f49c0]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We review literature from the past 18 months on the treatment of hyponatremia. Therapy must address both the consequences of the untreated electrolyte disturbance (including fatal cerebral edema due to acute water intoxication) and the complications of excessive therapy (the osmotic demyelination syndrome).

Recent Findings

Correction of hyponatremia by 4–6 mEq/l within 6 h, with bolus infusions of 3% saline if necessary, is sufficient to manage the most severe manifestations of hyponatremia. Planning therapy to achieve a 6 mEq/l daily increase in the serum sodium concentration can avoid iatrogenic brain damage by staying well clear of correction rates that are harmful. Conservative correction goals are wise because inadvertent overcorrection is common. Administration of desmopressin to halt a water diuresis can help prevent overcorrection; if overcorrection occurs, therapeutic relowering of the serum sodium concentration is supported by data in experimental animals and was found to be safe in a small observational clinical trial. Even mild and apparently asymptomatic hyponatremia may lead to falls because of impaired gait, and an increased likelihood of fracture because of hyponatremia-induced osteoporosis, a newly described entity. Recently approved vasopressin antagonists now make it possible to normalize the serum sodium concentration on a chronic basis, but practical considerations have limited their use.

### Rate of correction and all-cause mortality in patients with severe hypernatremia [^fdfc569b]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Correction Rate Calculation and Definitions

For each patient the initial sodium level was considered as the first sodium measurement equal to or exceeding 155 mmol/L. The subsequent 10 consecutive sodium measurements were recorded. The mean correction rate between documentation of severe hypernatremia and the first documented eunatremia (sodium ≤ 145mmol/L) was calculated for all patients. For patients with no documentation of eunatremia, the mean correction rate up to the last documented sodium level or the 10th sodium measurement following the documentation of severe hypernatremia was calculated. Fast correction rates were defined as those exceeding 0.5 mmol/L/h, while patients with correction rates less than or equal to 0.5 mmol/L/h were grouped as having slow correction rates. The maximal sodium correction rate was calculated for each patient, defined as the fastest correction rate between any 2 consecutive sodium measurements. The sodium correction within the first 24 hours following documentation of hypernatremia was also calculated for each patient using the latest sodium measurement within the first 24 hours from hypernatremia documentation.

Study End Points

The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 30 days. Secondary outcomes were defined as mortality within 7 days and 365 days, length of hospitalization, and rate of neurological complications.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to patients with liver disease, AASLD 2021 guidelines recommend to set the goal rate of increase of serum sodium of 4–6 mEq/L per 24-hour period (not exceeding 8 mEq/L per 24-hour period) to ameliorate the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome when correction of chronic hyponatremia is indicated in patients with cirrhosis.

### Disorders of sodium and water balance [^1eb0921f]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Dysnatremias occur simultaneously with disorders in water balance. The first priority is to correct dehydration; once the patient is euvolemic, the sodium level can be reassessed. In unstable patients with hyponatremia, the clinician should rapidly administer hypertonic saline. In unstable patients with hypernatremia, the clinician should administer isotonic intravenous fluid. In stable patients with either hyponatremia or hypernatremia, the clinician should aim for correction over 24 to 48 hours, with the maximal change in serum sodium between 8 to 12 mEq/L over the first 24 hours. This rate of correction decreases the chances of cerebral edema or osmotic demyelination syndrome.

### Desmopressin to prevent rapid sodium correction in severe hyponatremia: a systematic review [^fc1bb7cf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is common among inpatients and is associated with severe adverse outcomes such as osmotic demyelination syndrome. Current guidelines recommend serum sodium concentration correction targets of no more than 8 mEq/L per day in patients at high risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome. Desmopressin is recommended to control high rates of serum sodium concentration correction in severe hyponatremia. However, recommendations are based on limited data. The objective of this study is to review current strategies for DDAVP use in severe hyponatremia.

Methods

Systematic literature search of 4 databases of peer-reviewed studies was performed and study quality was appraised.

Results

The literature search identified 17 observational studies with 80 patients. We found 3 strategies for desmopressin administration in hyponatremia: 1) proactive, where desmopressin is administered early based on initial serum sodium concentration; 2) reactive, where desmopressin is administered based on changes in serum sodium concentration or urine output; 3) rescue, where desmopressin is administered after serum sodium correction targets are exceeded or when osmotic demyelination appears imminent. A proactive strategy of desmopressin administration with hypertonic saline was associated with lower incidence of exceeding serum sodium concentration correction targets, although this evidence is derived from a small case series.

Conclusions

Three distinct strategies for desmopressin administration are described in the literature. Limitations in study design and sample size prevent definitive conclusions about the optimal strategy for desmopressin administration to correct hyponatremia. There is a pressing need for better quality research to guide clinicians in managing severe hyponatremia.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^90dd948b]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder and it affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of hospitalized patients. Hyponatremia is defined by a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and most commonly results from water retention. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased hospital stay and mortality.

Observations

Symptoms and signs of hyponatremia range from mild and nonspecific (such as weakness or nausea) to severe and life-threatening (such as seizures or coma). Symptom severity depends on the rapidity of development, duration, and severity of hyponatremia. Mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with cognitive impairment, gait disturbances, and increased rates of falls and fractures. In a prospective study, patients with hyponatremia more frequently reported a history of falling compared with people with normal serum sodium levels (23.8% vs 16.4%, respectively; P < .01) and had a higher rate of new fractures over a mean follow-up of 7.4 years (23.3% vs 17.3%; P < .004). Hyponatremia is a secondary cause of osteoporosis. When evaluating patients, clinicians should categorize them according to their fluid volume status (hypovolemic hyponatremia, euvolemic hyponatremia, or hypervolemic hyponatremia). For most patients, the approach to managing hyponatremia should consist of treating the underlying cause. Urea and vaptans can be effective treatments for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure, but have adverse effects (eg, poor palatability and gastric intolerance with urea; and overly rapid correction of hyponatremia and increased thirst with vaptans). Severely symptomatic hyponatremia (with signs of somnolence, obtundation, coma, seizures, or cardiorespiratory distress) is a medical emergency. US and European guidelines recommend treating severely symptomatic hyponatremia with bolus hypertonic saline to reverse hyponatremic encephalopathy by increasing the serum sodium level by 4 mEq/L to 6 mEq/L within 1 to 2 hours but by no more than 10 mEq/L (correction limit) within the first 24 hours. This treatment approach exceeds the correction limit in about 4.5% to 28% of people. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may cause osmotic demyelination, a rare but severe neurological condition, which can result in parkinsonism, quadriparesis, or even death.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hyponatremia affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of patients who are hospitalized. Most patients should be managed by treating their underlying disease and according to whether they have hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic hyponatremia. Urea and vaptans can be effective in managing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure; hypertonic saline is reserved for patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia.

### Therapy for SIAD: what does the future hold? [^9090fb5e]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

The key, still unanswered, question remains whether correction of hyponatraemia will translate into improvement of hard, clinically meaningful, patient-related outcomes. An ongoing large RCT will hopefully answer the long-standing question whether correction of inpatient hyponatraemia can improve mortality and reduce readmission rate. In the outpatient setting, large prospective studies are needed to test the hypothesis that sodium normalisation can improve neurocognition, quality of life, and, potentially, bone mineral density and fracture rate. The justification for widespread use and reimbursement of pharmacotherapies for SIAD will finally be determined by their impact on hard patient-related outcomes and results of head-to-head studies, comparing various treatment options.

What will the future for SIAD treatment hold? The low efficacy and difficult adherence to fluid restriction highlight the need to expand the use of pharmacotherapy in clinical practice. Vaptans are the main candidates for widespread use, provided that we will have access to dosing and titration regimens, combining high efficacy and low risk of overly rapid correction at an affordable cost. Besides vaptans, SGLT-2 inhibitors will probably have a role as an adjunct treatment for chronic mild hyponatraemia.

### Association of hyponatremia with bone mineral density and fractures: a narrative review [^73156a4b]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Areas for future research

The significant association of hyponatremia with osteoporosis and fractures raises several questions. First and foremost, the key, but still unanswered, question remains whether correction of hyponatremia can improve patient outcomes, such as BMD, risk of falls and fracture occurrence. For this reason, long-term prospective studies, ideally randomized controlled trials, should be undertaken with the aim to evaluate the impact of correcting hyponatremia on bone health and fracture rate. In keeping with the US Food and Drug Administration requirement for a primary outcome of fracture for phase 3 osteoporosis drug trials, studies using the hard clinical endpoint of fracture occurrence are warranted to assess the effect of hyponatremia correction. Fractures are the ideal primary endpoint, but they can make these studies prohibitively large, long and costly because of the need to recruit a large number of participants with a long follow-up. Alternatively, prospective studies could examine the potential reversibility of osteoporosis through normalization of serum sodium. Using changes in BMD as the primary endpoint would reduce the sample size, duration and cost, but its appropriateness as a reliable surrogate marker for fracture risk reduction is still debated.

### Correction rates and clinical outcomes in hospitalized adults with severe hyponatremia… [^13f68a53]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Question For hospitalized adults with severe hyponatremia, what is the association of sodium correction rate with mortality. Findings In this systematic review and meta-analysis involving 16 studies and 11 811 patients, moderate-certainty evidence showed that rapid correction of severe hyponatremia was associated with 32 and 221 fewer in-hospital deaths per 1000 treated patients compared with slow and very slow correction, respectively. Low-certainty evidence suggested that rapid correction was associated with 61 and 134 fewer deaths per 1000 treated patients at 30 days compared with slow and very slow correction, respectively. Meaning The available evidence suggests that slow correction of severe hyponatremia was associated with an increased risk of mortality. Importance Hyponatremia treatment guidelines recommend limiting the correction of severe hyponatremia during the first 24 hours to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome.

Recent evidence suggests that slower rates of correction are associated with increased mortality. Study Selection Comparative studies assessing rapid vs slow and very slow correction of severe hyponatremia in hospitalized patients. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcomes were in-hospital and 30-day mortality, and secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay and ODS. Results. Moderate-certainty evidence showed that rapid correction was associated with 32 and 221 fewer in-hospital deaths per 1000 treated patients compared with slow and very slow correction, respectively. per 1000 treated patients at 30 days and with a reduction in LOS of 1. 20 and
3. 09 days, compared with slow and very slow correction, respectively. Rapid correction was not associated with a statistically significant increased risk of ODS.

### Hypertonic saline for hyponatremia: meeting goals and avoiding harm [^ed8f360d]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertonic saline has been used for the treatment of hyponatremia for nearly a century. There is now general consensus that hypertonic saline should be used in patients with hyponatremia associated with moderate or severe symptoms to prevent neurological complications. However, much less agreement exists among experts regarding other aspects of its use. Should hypertonic saline be administered as a bolus injection or continuous infusion? What is the appropriate dose? Is a central venous line necessary? Should desmopressin be used concomitantly and for how long? This article considers these important questions, briefly explores the historical origins of hypertonic saline use for hyponatremia, and reviews recent evidence behind its indications, dosing, administration modality and route, combined use with desmopressin to prevent rapid correction of serum sodium, and other considerations such as the need and degree for fluid restriction. The authors conclude by offering some practical recommendations for the use of hypertonic saline.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^694c3309]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Our treatment of hyponatremia should be informed by the best possible data, addressing two critical questions: How much correction is enough and how much is too much? Valid answers to these questions require studies of populations at high risk of complications from both excessive and inadequate correction of hyponatremia — patients with very low serum sodium. A study of individuals diagnosed with MRI-documented myelinolysis in the Swedish National Patient Register during 1997–2011 identified 83 patients with the disorder; 86.7% of patients were hyponatremic (all chronic), with a median sodium level at admission of 104 mmol/L, and all but six had been corrected by > 8 mmol/L in 24 hours. To be reliable, such studies will require rigorous methods to quantify increases in serum sodium throughout the hospital course and to accurately identify all complications — not just the most severe. In the future, those methods might include sophisticated software. But for now, meticulous chart review by hand, the method used when "osmotic demyelination syndrome" was given its name 37 years ago, remains the best approach.

Thankfully, changes in practice patterns have made osmotic demyelination syndrome less common than it was in the 1980s. On the basis of what we know today, correction of a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L by > 10 mmol/L within 24 hours or by > 18 mmol/L within 48 hours should be avoided — not because raising the serum sodium too rapidly commonly causes osmotic demyelination syndrome but because it can cause the syndrome. It has always been clear that overly rapid correction of hyponatremia does not inevitably lead to osmotic demyelination; rather, it is associated with a higher risk of osmotic demyelination.

The longer the duration of hyponatremia and the lower the serum sodium, the greater the risk for injury from excessive correction. If the sodium is ≤ 105 mmol/L or if there are additional risk factors for osmotic demyelination syndrome (alcohol use disorder, hypokalemia, malnutrition, or advanced liver disease), correction by > 8 mmol/L per day should be considered excessive. The cost of limiting correction (more frequent blood draws and perhaps a somewhat longer hospitalization) is trivial when compared with the devastating consequences that can affect even surviving patients with osmotic demyelination syndrome. We strongly believe that abandoning established safeguards now is a bit like discarding your umbrella because you have remained dry in a rainstorm. We urge clinicians to continue to treat severe hyponatremia cautiously and to wait for better evidence before adopting less stringent therapeutic limits.

### Clinical factors associated with hyponatremia correction during treatment with oral urea [^c4869d2e]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What was known:

In patients with chronic hyponatremia plasma sodium should be gradually corrected to prevent osmotic demyelination.
Recent observational studies have reported positive experiences with oral urea for the treatment of hyponatremia, but factors associated with the correction rate are unknown.

This study adds:

Older age, lower baseline plasma sodium and higher cumulative urea dose increase the correction rate of hyponatremia during treatment with oral urea.
Combining oral urea with fluid restriction may further increase the correction rate of hyponatremia.

Potential impact:

In patients with hyponatremia who are older or have a low initial plasma sodium, oral urea may need to be given for a shorter duration without fluid restriction.
Our study also adds to the growing body of evidence that oral urea generally is a safe and effective treatment for hyponatremia.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^b611ef4b]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder. Multiple organizations have published guidance documents to assist clinicians in managing hyponatremia. We aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of these documents.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and websites of guideline organizations and professional societies to September 2014 without language restriction for Clinical Practice Guidelines (defined as any document providing guidance informed by systematic literature review) and Consensus Statements (any other guidance document) developed specifically to guide differential diagnosis or treatment of hyponatremia. Four reviewers appraised guideline quality using the 23-item AGREE II instrument, which rates reporting of the guidance development process across six domains: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence. Total scores were calculated as standardized averages by domain.

Results

We found ten guidance documents; five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements. Overall, quality was mixed: two clinical practice guidelines attained an average score of > 50% for all of the domains, three rated the evidence in a systematic way and two graded strength of the recommendations. All five consensus statements received AGREE scores below 60% for each of the specific domains. The guidance documents varied widely in scope. All dealt with therapy and seven included recommendations on diagnosis, using serum osmolality to confirm hypotonic hyponatremia, and volume status, urinary sodium concentration, and urinary osmolality for further classification of the hyponatremia. They differed, however, in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Eight guidance documents advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset (< 48 h) hyponatremia. In chronic (> 48 h) or asymptomatic cases, recommended treatments were NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. Eight guidance documents recommended limits for speed of increase of sodium concentration, but these varied between 8 and 12 mmol/L per 24 h. Inconsistencies also existed in the recommended dose of NaCl, its initial infusion speed, and which second line interventions to consider.

Conclusions

Current guidance documents on the assessment and treatment of hyponatremia vary in methodological rigor and recommendations are not always consistent.

### Revisiting new data on the mortality benefit of rapid correction of hyponatremia: Déj à Vu all over again [^5ccfec94]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Studies in the 1980s linking rapid correction of severe, chronic hyponatremia to the osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) led to a major controversy that eventually gave way to consensus guidelines. Efforts to limit correction to ≤ 8 mmol/L per day in patients at high risk of developing ODS became common practice. Recent studies have questioned these guidelines, suggesting that ODS is rare and that slow correction may increase mortality. In this review, we revisit the history of the controversy and find that these claims have persisted for four decades. Older studies supporting faster correction are flawed by referral bias while newer studies are limited by confounding as comorbidities influence rates of both mortality and hyponatremia correction. While both old and new studies emphasize the rarity of MRI-documented ODS after rapid correction, they were not conducted in hyponatremic patients who were at risk for ODS. Old studies reporting hyponatremic deaths due to cerebral edema overestimate its true incidence and new studies reporting an association of mortality and slow rates of sodium correction do not document cerebral edema as a common contributor to death. Further research is required to better define the incidence of both ODS and cerebral edema in patients at risk for these complications. Until then, we conclude that the risks of rapid correction-including irreversible neurological damage-necessitate caution. Clinicians should continue to prioritize slow, controlled sodium correction to protect high-risk patients from harm.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to management of severely symptomatic patients, initial management, AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend to limit sodium correction to 8 mEq/L over 24 hours in patients with chronic hyponatremia at increased risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome. Limit sodium correction to 12 mEq/L over 24 hours and 18 mEq/L over 48 hours in patients without risk factors to minimize the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome.

### Hyponatremia treatment guidelines 2007: expert panel recommendations [^d18691e4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Although hyponatremia is a common, usually mild, and relatively asymptomatic disorder of electrolytes, acute severe hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with concomitant disease. In addition, overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic deficits and death, and optimal treatment strategies for such cases are not established. An expert panel assessed the potential contributions of aquaretic nonpeptide small-molecule arginine vasopressin receptor (AVPR) antagonists to hyponatremia therapies. This review presents their conclusions, including identification of appropriate treatment populations and possible future indications for aquaretic AVPR antagonists.

### Serum sodium correction rate and the outcome in severe hyponatremia [^c593bd6a]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We investigated the serum sodium correction rate on length of hospitalization and survival rate, in severe chronic hyponatremic patients at the Emergency Department (ED).

Design

An observational study using clinical chart review.

Setting

The ED of the University Hospital of Marcianise, Caserta, Italy with approximately 30,000 patients visits a year.

Type Of Participants

We reviewed sixty-seven patients with severe hyponatremia subdivided in 2 subgroups: group A consisting of 35 patients with serum sodium correction rate < 0.3mmol/h and group B consisting of 32 patients with serum sodium correction rate between < 0.5 and ≥ 0.3mmol/h.

Intervention

Emergency patients were evaluated for serum sodium correction rate for hyponatremia by clinical chart review.

Measurements and Main Results

Severe hyponatremia was defined as a serum sodium level < 120mmol/l. Mean serum sodium correction rate of hyponatremia was of 0.17 ± 0.09% in group A and 0.41 ± 0.05% in group B (p < 0.001 vs group A). The length of hospital stay was 10.7 ± 3.7days for group A, and it was significantly decreased to 3.8 ± 0.4days for group B (p < 0.005 vs group A). In addition we observed that correction rate of hyponatremia in group A was associated with a significantly lower survival rate (25%) in comparison to group B (60%) (p < 0.001 vs group A).

Conclusion

We observed that serum sodium correction rate ≥ 0.3 and < 0.5mmol/h was associated with a shorter length of hospital stay and a major survival rate.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^bcbfb0d7]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Subsequently, several studies confirmed that osmotic demyelination was associated with more rapid rates of correction of chronic hyponatremia. – Excluding case series on the basis of patient referrals, studies of patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L that include data on correction rates and outcomes are presented in Table 1. The frequency of osmotic demyelination varied widely among studies, depending on pretreatment serum sodium, correction rate, and method of identifying post-therapeutic neurologic sequelae. However, it is apparent that in patients with chronic hyponatremia, the lower the serum sodium and the larger the increase, the more likely that osmotic demyelination will be identified.

Table 1
Post-treatment neurologic sequelae in studies of patients with serum sodium concentrations ≤ 120 mmol/L

When osmotic demyelination syndrome was first described, it was widely believed that to avoid potentially fatal neurologic complications of severe symptomatic hyponatremia, it was important to rapidly raise the serum sodium to a "safe" level above 120 mmol/L and, according to some experts, to as high as 130 mmol/L. At a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L, it becomes impossible to both raise the serum sodium to a "safe" level and avoid correction by > 12 mmol/L per day; a choice must be made between the risks of persistent, severe hyponatremia, and the risks of osmotic demyelination. Because a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L is uncommon, a letter was sent to all members of the American Society of Nephrology seeking data on patients with a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L who had been recently treated, regardless of outcome. Data on 56 patients obtained from 40 medical centers confirmed that outcomes depend on the chronicity of hyponatremia, as previously defined: While none of the 18 patients with acute hyponatremia suffered complications, regardless of correction rate, 14 of 28 patients with chronic hyponatremia corrected by > 12 mmol/L in 24 hours developed post-therapeutic neurologic complications; in most, the clinical course was consistent with CPM (a delayed onset of neurologic symptoms beginning 2–6 days after initial improvement), but only three had CPM documented by imaging. The amount of correction over 48 hours was also associated with post-therapeutic complications: 14 of 27 chronic patients (52%) corrected by > 18 mmol/L in 48 hours were affected. All patients corrected by > 12 mmol/L in 24 hours had also been corrected by > 18 mmol/L in 48 hours, and all but one corrected by < 12 mmol/L in 24 hours were corrected by < 18 mmol/L in 48 hours.

### A low initial serum sodium level is associated with an increased risk of overcorrection in patients with chronic profound hyponatremia: a retrospective cohort analysis [^be330dd8]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Risk of overcorrection

Risk factors for ODS included an initial SNa of < 105 mEq/L and overcorrection. International guidelines recommend avoidance of overcorrection in the management of patients with hyponatremia; however, risk factors for overcorrection have not been fully investigated. In contrast, avoidance of overcorrection or ODS may lead to prolonged or inadequate management of patients with hyponatremia, leading to undercorrection in clinical practice. We need to develop an optimal treatment strategy to assure a safe correction rate of SNa to achieve an appropriate correction while avoiding overcorrection. With this point of view, we conducted this retrospective study to determine the risk factors for overcorrection and believe that our results will guide physicians in the management of these patients. Our study revealed that a low level of SNa at presentation was associated with overcorrection, with an adjusted OR of 1.19 for every 1 mEq/L decrease (0.84 for every 1 mEq/L increase). This meant that a 4 mEq/L lower SNa level doubled the risk of overcorrection. Although several previous retrospective studies have indicated that the SNa at presentation was lower in patients with overcorrection compared to those without, a direct association between the SNa levels and risk of overcorrection has not been evaluated previously. Our results alert clinicians to be cautious of the incremental risk of overcorrection when patients present with low SNa levels.

### Dysnatremia, its correction, and mortality in patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy: a prospective observational study [^d7dcfe42]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

In addition to the correlation issue between dysnatremia and mortality, it remains unresolved whether the correction of sodium could reduce mortality, particularly in the presence of several comorbidities. A study of this issue is difficult to conduct. Thus, the present study might be helpful, despite its observational design, in understanding the correlation. In contrast to the baseline level, subsequent sodium levels did not predict mortality irrespective of timeframe (24 and 72 h), possibly because of case-mix results, such as the group with baseline dysnatremia later having normonatremia. Furthermore, the change in sodium level, including the appropriate correction of dysnatremia, was not correlated with mortality. These results suggested that sodium level itself might accurately predict mortality in association with comorbidities or other related factors; however, the correction of sodium alone did not contribute to a survival benefit, particularly under the strong influence of comorbidities.

The association with mortality may differ for hyponatremia and hypernatremia. In the present cohort, mild hypernatremia was not associated with mortality in contrast to the results of mild hyponatremia. The discrepancy between the effects of hypo- and hypernatremia has been reported in other observational studies. Each association with mortality could be sensitive to the disease state of study. However, although the baseline characteristics differ across studies, hyponatremia and hypernatremia should be considered separately in research, as well as in clinical practice.

Although the present results are informative, this study has some limitations. First, the observational study design limits the drawing of conclusions, because of causality. However, randomized trials of dysnatremia treatment to determine survival benefit are not feasible, particularly in the presence of comorbidities; thus, the present results might be helpful in raising awareness of the correlation between sodium correction and outcomes. Second, the present cohort of patients who underwent CRRT is a particular subgroup, thus hindering the applicability of the conclusions to other populations. Furthermore, a single therapeutic intervention (i.e. sodium correction) might not show a survival benefit under conditions of high comorbidity rates of CRRT patients. Third, sodium levels corrected for glucose may not be accurate, because the correction factor may be altered by patient characteristics or high glucose states. Lastly, we did not retrieve important variables (e.g. correction rate of dysnatremia and neurologic outcomes), which could affect the overall outcome.

### Vasopressin receptor antagonists for the treatment of hyponatremia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^33f332b8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia, the effect of vasopressin antagonists is yet undefined.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Setting & Population

In- and outpatients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia.

Selection Criteria For Studies

We included all RCTs regardless of publication status or language.

Intervention

Vasopressin antagonists with or without fluid restriction versus placebo or no treatment with or without fluid restriction.

Outcomes

Response rate defined as normalization of serum sodium level or significant increase in serum sodium level at 3–7 days (primary) and later, change from baseline serum sodium level at 3–7 days and later, adverse events, rate of rapid sodium level correction, and rate of hypernatremia.

Results

15 RCTs were identified. Vasopressin antagonist treatment significantly increased response rate both early (RR, 3.15; 95% CI, 2.27–4.37; 11 trials) and late (RR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.79–2.89; 4 trials). Response rates were high in trials assessing mostly euvolemic patients and those assessing mostly hypervolemic patients, with greater effect estimate in the former. Change from baseline serum sodium level was significantly increased both early (weighted mean difference, 5.27 mEq/L; 95% CI, 4.27–6.26, 13 trials) and late (weighted mean difference, 3.49 mEq/L; 95% CI, 2.56–4.41, 8 trials). Although there was an increased rate of rapid sodium correction (RR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.26–5.08, 8 trials) with vasopressin antagonists, hypernatremia rates were not significantly higher (RR, 2.21; 95% CI, 0.61–7.96; 5 trials), adverse events were not increased, and there were no reports of osmotic demyelination syndrome.

Limitations

Significant heterogeneity in the primary outcome.

Conclusions

Vasopressin antagonists are effective for the treatment of hypervolemic and euvolemic hyponatremia.

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte abnormality affecting hospitalized patients. 1 It is an independent predictor for mortality and is associated with increased length of hospital stay and higher costs. The most serious potential complication is hyponatremic encephalopathy, a medical emergency that can result in death or irreversible brain injury if inadequately treated. 2 Hypertonic saline is a safe and effective means of correcting hyponatremia. 2–4 A rare yet serious complication from excessive correction of chronic hyponatremia is the development of cerebral demyelination.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^5f4beb21]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

For patients presenting with severe symptoms, the European Clinical Practice Guidelines and US/Irish expert panel both advocate bolus infusions of hypertonic saline in an effort to raise the serum sodium by 5 mmol/L (European) or by 4–6 mmol/L (US/Irish) within a few hours. An increase of this magnitude is sufficient to markedly reduce intracranial pressure and can reverse impending brain herniation. Bolus infusion of hypertonic saline has been reported to achieve the desired increment in serum sodium more rapidly than a continuous infusion of 3% saline, and it is associated with better clinical outcomes.

After treatment with either isotonic saline or hypertonic saline given by bolus or continuous infusion, the serum sodium often increases by more than intended. Indeed, the risk of "overshooting the mark" is one of the stated reasons for setting conservative correction goals when treating patients for severe hyponatremia. However, the main reason for an excessive rise in serum sodium is not an excessive dose of saline; rather, it is the sudden elimination of a large volume of dilute urine. If the cause of water retention and hyponatremia resolves, a water diuresis (often called an aquaresis) will emerge during treatment and can increase serum sodium by more than 2 mmol/L per hour. For this reason, in patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L, it is important to measure the serum sodium frequently and to monitor urine output carefully during treatment.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^493a79da]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

After achieving an initial modest sodium increase, sufficient to prevent acute outcomes related to raised ICP, the focus turns to prevention of further rapid sodium rise to avoid overcorrection and ODS. Indeed, often the real challenge in managing severe hypotonic hyponatremia of chronic (> 24 hours) or unknown duration is to prevent this potentially deleterious overshoot. Relowering of serum sodium with IV 5% dextrose, with or without desmopressin to reduce urine output may be required, typically in a high-dependency setting, to maintain sodium rise ideally to 5 to 8 mmol above baseline within 24 hours, with a limit of no more than 10 to 12 mmol within 24 hours (see "In Case of Overcorrection: Relowering of Plasma Sodium"). In patients with risk factors for ODS (see Table 3), one should aim for even slower corrections, 4 to 6 mmol within 24 hours and a limit of 8 mmol/L in any 24-hour period, especially as such an increment is generally sufficient to prevent adverse clinical outcomes from acute hyponatremia-associated increase in ICP (see "Acute Severe Hyponatremia").

### Principles of management of severe hyponatremia [^f84ee988]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Severity

Hyponatremia is considered as severe if [Na] is < 115 or 110 mmol/L. In addition, all cases of hyponatremia treated with hypertonic or isotonic saline infusion, including hypovolemia with hyponatremia and absence of overt neurological manifestations, should be considered as severe because of the risks from saline infusion. Saline infusion for hypovolemic hyponatremia carries arguably the highest risk of inadvertently rapid rise in[Na].

Target Serum Sodium Concentration

The targeted rise in [Na] depends on the perceived urgency of treatment. In patients with pronounced hyponatremic symptoms, regardless of chronicity, a rapid rise of 4 to 6 mEq/L is recommended. Further rises may be required if symptoms persist after the initial rise in [Na]. For chronic hyponatremia, previous recommendations set a maximal rate of rise in [Na] at 12 mEq/L in the first 24 hours and a maximal final [Na] of 125 to 130 mEq/L. Because osmotic myelinolysis was observed in patients achieving the desired rate of rise in [Na], the current target rise in [Na] is set at 6 to 8 mEq/L in 24 hours, 12 to 14 mEq/L in 48 hours, and 14 to 16 mEq/L in 72 hours. Prevention of hypernatremia during treatment of hyponatremia is imperative.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^1438df03]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are electrolyte disorders that can be associated with poor outcomes. Hyponatremia is considered mild when the sodium concentration is 130 to 134 mEq per L, moderate when 125 to 129 mEq per L, and severe when less than 125 mEq per L. Mild symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weakness, headache, and mild neurocognitive deficits. Severe symptoms of hyponatremia include delirium, confusion, impaired consciousness, ataxia, seizures, and, rarely, brain herniation and death. Patients with a sodium concentration of less than 125 mEq per L and severe symptoms require emergency infusions with 3% hypertonic saline. Using calculators to guide fluid replacement helps avoid overly rapid correction of sodium concentration, which can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome. Physicians should identify the cause of a patient's hyponatremia, if possible; however, treatment should not be delayed while a diagnosis is pursued. Common causes include certain medications, excessive alcohol consumption, very low-salt diets, and excessive free water intake during exercise. Management to correct sodium concentration is based on whether the patient is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is treated with normal saline infusions. Treating euvolemic hyponatremia includes restricting free water consumption or using salt tablets or intravenous vaptans. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is treated primarily by managing the underlying cause (e.g., heart failure, cirrhosis) and free water restriction. Hypernatremia is less common than hyponatremia. Mild hypernatremia is often caused by dehydration resulting from an impaired thirst mechanism or lack of access to water; however, other causes, such as diabetes insipidus, are possible. Treatment starts with addressing the underlying etiology and correcting the fluid deficit. When sodium is severely elevated, patients are symptomatic, or intravenous fluids are required, hypotonic fluid replacement is necessary.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^03756c2f]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Potential reasons for a less pronounced effect on mortality in SIAD (if this is a true effect confirmed in future studies) are unclear and remain speculative. It has been shown that paradoxically, mortality rate seems to be lower in patients with pronounced hyponatremia (< 120 mmol/L) compared to patients with a milder hyponatremia. Interestingly, the degree of hyponatremia varies according to hyponatremia etiology, and notably, SIAD seems to predispose to very low sodium concentrations. In patients with pNa below 120 mmol/L, the therapeutic approach has been shown to be different, with a higher percentage of ICU admission and of hypertonic saline administration as well as a more rapid initial sodium correction rate. This could possibly explain the lower mortality rates but higher ICU admission rates in these patients. However, since exact sodium concentrations were not known, this remains speculative. An alternative explanation for the "protective" role of SIAD might be the exact opposite, that is, that patients with SIAD had milder hyponatremia. Finally, the severity of the intercurrent diseases, medical complications during hospitalization, or the proportion of patients receiving palliative care might not have been distributed in a comparable way in both groups.

Regardless of cause, hyponatremia as a whole is associated with increased mortality, and timely diagnosis and treatment are important in improving clinical outcomes.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to patients with liver disease, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to limit the use of hypertonic saline in the management of hypervolemic hyponatremia to the rare cases presenting with life-threatening complications. Consider administering hypertonic saline in patients with severe hyponatremia expected to get liver transplantation within a few days. Correct the serum sodium concentration slowly (≤ 8 mmol/L per day), once an attenuation of symptoms has been obtained, to avoid irreversible neurological sequelae, such as osmotic demyelination.

### Overcorrection of hyponatremia is a medical emergency [^45ce3032]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Overcorrection of hyponatremia is a medical emergency. Excessive correction usually results from the unexpected emergence of a water diuresis after resolution of the cause of water retention. The concurrent administration of desmopressin and 5% dextrose in water can be given to cautiously re-lower the serum sodium concentration when therapeutic limits have been exceeded. Nephrologists should be equally aggressive in correcting hyponatremia and in un-correcting it when their patients get too much of a good thing.

Purpose Of Review

Hyponatremia causes significant morbidity, mortality, and disability. This review considers the literature of the past 18 months to improve understanding of these complications and to identify therapeutic strategies to prevent them.

Recent Findings

Acute hyponatremia causes serious brain swelling that can lead to permanent disability or death. A 4-6mEq/l increase in serum sodium is sufficient to reverse impending herniation. Brain swelling is minimal in chronic hyponatremia, and to avoid osmotic demyelination, correction should not exceed 8mEq/l/day. In high-risk patients, correction should not exceed 4-6mEq/l/day. Inadvertent overcorrection of hyponatremia is common and preventable by controlling unwanted urinary water losses with desmopressin. Even mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with increased mortality, attention deficit, gait instability, osteoporosis, and fractures, but it is not known if the correction of mild hyponatremia improves outcomes.

Summary

Controlled trials are needed to identify affordable treatments for hyponatremia that reduce the need for hospitalization, decrease hospital length of stay, and decrease morbidity. Such trials could also help answer the question of whether hyponatremia causes excess mortality or whether it is simply a marker for severe, lethal, underlying disease.

Practice Guidelines

After weighing the evidence, the European Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended that correction of hyponatremia be limited to 10 mmol/L in the first day of treatment and 8 mmol/L for every subsequent day thereafter. An expert panel that included six physicians from the United States and one from Ireland (which we will call the "US/Irish expert panel") came to similar conclusions, but with some added nuance (expressed in italics). For chronically hyponatremic patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L (for example, outpatients drinking conventional volumes of water or treated with thiazides and hospital-acquired hyponatremia with a known duration > 48 hours) who were at normal risk of developing osmotic demyelination, the panel recommended a correction limit of 10–12 mmol/L in any 24-hour period and 18 mmol/L in any 48-hour period and a minimum correction of 4–8 mmol/L. The panel recommended increased vigilance for patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L at heightened risk of osmotic demyelination. Factors reported to be associated with a higher risk of osmotic demyelination include sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L, alcohol use disorder, hypokalemia, malnutrition, or advanced liver disease. In these high-risk patients, the US/Irish expert panel recommended that correction should not exceed 8 mmol/L in any 24-hour period and that the minimum daily correction goal should be 4–6 mmol/L. In patients without major risk factors for osmotic demyelination, the panel noted that correction by 8–12 mmol/L in the first day of therapy was greater than necessary, but unlikely to cause harm as long as the 2-day increment does not exceed 18 mmol/L.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — acute in-hospital treatment recommendations — Oral and IV hypotonic or isotonic hydration should be avoided early in the management of EAH, although it may be appropriate in certain clinical contexts once sodium correction has been initiated or hypovolemia is confirmed. Recommendation grade: 1C. With suspected EAH, and particularly in those with altered mental status, sodium estimation should be obtained as rapidly as possible after hospital arrival. Recommendation grade: 1A. A rapid assessment for signs and symptoms of cerebral edema or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema should be done in all patients with possible EAH. Recommendation grade: 1A. Severe EAH biochemically confirmed or symptomatic EAH should be treated with a 100-mL bolus of IV HTS, which can be repeated twice at 10-min intervals (3 doses in total) or until improvement of neurologic symptoms, with the aim of acutely increasing serum sodium concentration by about 4 to 5 mmol·L−1 and reversing cerebral edema. Recommendation grade: 1A.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^19dbc176]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyponatremia:

- **Definition**: Hyponatremia an electrolyte disorder characterized by low serum sodium concentration, and is typically defined as a serum sodium of < 135 mEq/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: Causes of hyponatremia include increased water intake (psychogenic polydipsia), low dietary solute intake (tea and toast diet), decreased water excretion secondary to elevated plasma ADH levels (volume depletion, SIADH, severe hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency), and expansion of plasma volume in the context of edematous states.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hyponatremia in the general population of the US is 1.72%.
- **Disease course**: Treatment of hyponatremia requires careful attention to avoid overly rapid correction of serum sodium, which can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome, permanent neurological impairment, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 40% of patients with osmotic demyelination syndrome recover fully, whereas 25% have persistent neurological deficits. Mortality associated with osmotic demyelination syndrome is approximately 6%.

There were 3922 patients (92.0%) categorized as having slow correction rates (Table 1). Patients with slow correction rates were older than those with fast correction rates (median [IQR] age: 78 [64–87] years vs 74 [59–85] years; P < .001) and had higher median (IQR) Charlson comorbidity index (5 [3–6] vs 4 [2–6]; P < .001), a difference driven by a higher prevalence of most comorbidities rather than differences in specific conditions (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). Patients with slow correction rates had higher median (IQR) serum creatinine (1.38 [0.97–1.99] mg/dL vs 1.02 (0.70–1.62) mg/dL; P < .001) and BUN/creatinine ratio (32.8 [24.6–43.0] vs 23.1 [15.8–35.2]; P < .001), probably reflecting more severe volume contraction.

### Tolvaptan for the treatment of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^395ce0e0]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

The third research question relates to the main safety concern of tolvaptan, the likelihood for overly rapid hyponatraemia correction. Specifically, we need to establish the effectiveness and safety of tolvaptan in patients with very low serum sodium, for example, below 120 mmol/litre, who are most in need of hyponatraemia correction, and at the same time are exposed to the greatest risk of overcorrection. What is the magnitude of this risk when tolvaptan is used under stringent protocols, encompassing close electrolyte/fluid balance monitoring and measures to halt/reverse too rapid correction? In the era of personalised medicine, large prospective studies are warranted to demonstrate the parameters that can predict the magnitude of response to tolvaptan and are associated with high likelihood for over-rapid sodium correction. These data would provide the evidence basis for the development of a risk calculator for tolvaptan-related overly rapid sodium increase, individualising the starting dose and monitoring of tolvaptan. Various protocols of tolvaptan initiation, titration, monitoring and corrective measures should be prospectively tested to develop an algorithm for tolvaptan use, readily applicable to clinical practice, achieving maximal drug efficacy and safety. For example, an open-label randomisation trial is in progress, randomising patients with non-hypovolaemic hyponatraemia to receive either 7.5 mg tolvaptan or fluid restriction imposed at 1000 ml/day, testing the hypothesis that tolvaptan can improve the rate of sodium correction as well as clinical outcomes, without exposing the patients at high risk of serum sodium overcorrection. These studies will determine the utility of tolvaptan in clinical practice and provide an evidence-based framework for tolvaptan administration and monitoring.

### Severe hyponatremia correction, mortality, and central pontine myelinolysis [^67c65547]. NEJM Evidence (2023). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND: In clinical practice, sodium correction rates are frequently limited in patients with severe hyponatremia to prevent neurologic complications. The implications of correction rates on overall mortality and length of hospital stay are unclear. METHODS: In this multicenter observational study, we evaluated the association of sodium correction rates with mortality, length of stay, and central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) in patients hospitalized with severe hyponatremia (admission serum sodium level less than 120 mEq/l). RESULTS: The cohort included 3274 patients. A correction rate of less than 6 mEq/l/24 hours was observed in 38%, 6 to 10 mEq/l/24 hours was observed in 29%, and greater than 10 mEq/l/24 hours was observed in 33%. Compared with 6 to 10 mEq/l/24 hours, a correction rate of less than 6 mEq/l/24 hours exhibited higher in-hospital mortality in multivariable-adjusted and propensity score–weighted analyses. Compared with 6 to 10 mEq/l/24 hours, a correction rate of greater than 10 mEq/l/24 hours was associated with lower in-hospital mortality and shorter length of stay in multivariable analyses. Seven patients with CPM were identified, with five of seven developing CPM despite a sodium correction rate of less than or equal to 8 mEq/l/24 hours. Six of seven patients who developed CPM had alcohol use disorder, malnutrition, hypokalemia, or hypophosphatemia. CONCLUSIONS: Limiting the sodium correction rate was associated with higher mortality and longer length of stay. Whether the sodium correction rate influences neurologic complications needs further evaluation.

### Hyponatremia: clinical diagnosis and management [^942c05b7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common clinical problem in hospitalized patients and nursing home residents. It also may occur in healthy athletes after endurance exercise. The majority of patients with hyponatremia are asymptomatic and do not require immediate correction of hyponatremia. Symptomatic hyponatremia is a medical emergency requiring rapid correction to prevent the worsening of brain edema. How fast we should increase the serum sodium levels depends on the onset of hyponatremia and still remains controversial. If the serum sodium levels are corrected too rapidly, patients may develop central pontine myelinolysis, but if they are corrected too slowly, patients may die of brain herniation. We review the epidemiology and mechanisms of hyponatremia, the sensitivity of women to hyponatremic injury, the adaptation and maladaptation of brain cells to hyponatremia and its correction, and the practical ways of managing hyponatremia. Because the majority of hyponatremia is caused by the non-osmotic release of vasopressin, the recent approval of the vasopressin receptor antagonist conivaptan for euvolemic hyponatremia may simplify hyponatremia management. However, physicians should be aware of the risk of rapid correction of hyponatremia, hypotension, and excessive fluid intake.

Figure 7.
Principles of management of acute vs chronic hyponatremia, and potential risks. Intensity of shading is a visual representation of osmolality. In acute hyponatremia, cerebral osmolar adaptation has not yet occurred so it is acceptable to allow (or induce) rapid correction of serum sodium, with low risk of ODS. We advocate a cutoff of hyponatremia duration less than 24 hours rather than 48 hours to maximize the safety of this approach. In hyponatremia with severe symptoms of any (or unknown) duration, emergency management with bolus hypertonic saline is indicated to prevent progression of potentially life-threatening cerebral edema (see "Emergency Management of Severe Hyponatremia"). Once the target initial increment of serum sodium rise is achieved (eg, 4–6 mmol/L) and/or if symptoms improve, ongoing correction is determined by duration of hyponatremia. If duration is unknown, it is safest to assume it to be chronic and aim for gradual correction. In chronic hyponatremia, gradual correction of serum sodium allows for restoration of brain tissue osmolality toward the normal range with the import or synthesis of osmolytes (sodium, potassium, organic osmolytes as discussed in Fig. 3), and slow exit of excess intracellular water. The typical target rate of correction is 5 to 8 mmol/L per 24 hours, or lower for those with risk factors for ODS. If rapid correction of serum sodium above the target rate occurs (overcorrection, eg, > 10 mmol/L within 24 hours), it is advised to relower serum sodium (eg, with IV dextrose 5%, and/or desmopressin (DDAVP), see "In Case of Overcorrection: Relowering of Plasma Sodium" below) to prevent the rare complication of ODS. ODS can occur as a consequence of rapid exit of intracellular water damaging the myelin sheath, particularly in the pons, and can cause devastating neurological outcomes or death. Onset of symptoms of ODS is often delayed. Subsequent correction after relowering should be gradual.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^d256080a]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Current international hyponatremia guidelines differ in their recommendations regarding the use of tolvaptan. US expert panel recommendations, while acknowledging insufficient evidence for tolvaptan use with serum sodium less than 120 mmol/L, endorse its use as a second-line treatment, with appropriate monitoring and prompt intervention if the recommended rate of serum sodium increase is exceeded, and even raise the possibility that it may be a potential first-line therapy option in the future. European guidelines, however, recommend against the use of tolvaptan in moderate-profound hyponatremia, primarily out of concern regarding the potential risk of excessively rapid serum sodium correction. Other potential concerns raised about tolvaptan include cost and risk of liver function derangement seen with sustained higher-dose tolvaptan therapy used for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (up to 120 mg daily). A US FDA safety notice was issued in 2013 limiting the use of tolvaptan in hyponatremia to less than 30 days' duration, and removing the indication for patients with cirrhosis. Safe long-term tolvaptan use for up to 4 years has been reported in 111 participants in the SALTWATER trial (the SALT trial extension study), though 1 patient with cirrhosis developed hepatorenal syndrome and died, which was considered "possibly related" to tolvaptan use. So far, there are no reported cases of liver dysfunction directly attributed to the lower doses and typically short durations of tolvaptan in SIAD.

We use tolvaptan as a second-line therapy in selected inpatients and occasional outpatients with SIAD, typically when refractory to FR. Safety information recommends initiation and reinitiation in the hospital to allow monitoring. Careful patient selection is important, plus close monitoring of serum sodium and urine output, readiness to administer IV dextrose if correction targets are exceeded, and daily reevaluation of each dose. Based on existing evidence and clinical experience, we have developed the following recommendations for tolvaptan use (Table 8), which form the basis of an inpatient RCT protocol that is currently underway (ACTRN12619001683123), aiming to provide a prospective evidence base to evaluate these recommendations. We use tolvaptan less frequently in outpatients because of the product information recommending against long-term use, high cost, and limited monitoring capacity — in this situation we prefer oral urea.

Sodium correction and mortality

We further analyzed the risk of mortality according to the change in sodium over 24 or 72 h. The number of 30-day death cases for each group is shown in Additional file 2. First, the non-linear relationships between adjusted ORs for mortality and changes in sodium levels were explored (Fig. 4). In the groups with baseline normonatremia or hyponatremia, the change in sodium over 24 or 72 h did not show an association with the risk of mortality (Fig. 4a to d). In the group with baseline hypernatremia (Fig. 4e and f), a greater decrease in sodium seemed to incur a reduced risk of mortality. However, this trend was shown only in the change over 24 h and not over 72 h. In particular, comparison of mortality rates within three sodium groups, i.e. normonatremia to normonatremia, hyponatremia to hyponatremia, and hypernatremia to hypernatremia, showed no significant difference (Additional file 3). Moreover, when adjusted for the sodium level at baseline, the change in sodium levels did not have any significance with mortality (all P s > 0.05). These results indicated that sodium change and correction of dysnatremia did not change the mortality risk.

### A mathematical approach to severe hyponatremia and hypernatremia in renal replacement therapies [^908c4563]. Seminars in Dialysis (2021). Medium credibility.

Severe dysnatremias are perplexing problems in patients undergoing renal replacement therapy on a chronic or acute basis. The ability to manipulate sodium concentration in the dialysate or replacement solutions is limited. Compounding dialysate or replacement fluids to alter sodium concentration could result in errors. Rapid correction of hyponatremia or hypernatremia due to equilibrium with dialysate or replacement solutions could lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome or cerebral edema respectively. Continuous renal replacement therapy is the preferred dialysis modality in patients with severe dysnatremias. In this article, we present simple formulas to determine the rate of hypotonic or hypertonic solutions needed to mitigate rapid correction of dysnatremias. These formulas can be used readily by the clinician at bedside.

### Current treatment practice and outcomes. report of the hyponatremia registry [^5bef3293]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Current management practices for hyponatremia (HN) are incompletely understood. The HN Registry has recorded diagnostic measures, utilization, efficacy, and outcomes of therapy for eu- or hypervolemic HN. To better understand current practices, we analyzed data from 3087 adjudicated adult patients in the registry with serum sodium concentration of 130mEq/l or less from 225 sites in the United States and European Union. Common initial monotherapy treatments were fluid restriction (35%), administration of isotonic (15%) or hypertonic saline (2%), and tolvaptan (5%); 17% received no active agent. Median (interquartile range) mEq/l serum sodium increases during the first day were as follows: no treatment, 1.0 (0.0–4.0); fluid restriction, 2.0 (0.0–4.0); isotonic saline, 3.0 (0.0–5.0); hypertonic saline, 5.0 (1.0–9.0); and tolvaptan, 4.0 (2.0–9.0). Adjusting for initial serum sodium concentration with logistic regression, the relative likelihoods for correction by 5mEq/l or more (referent, fluid restriction) were 1.60 for hypertonic saline and 2.55 for tolvaptan. At discharge, serum sodium concentration was under 135mEq/l in 78% of patients and 130mEq/l or less in 49%. Overly rapid correction occurred in 7.9%. Thus, initial HN treatment often uses maneuvers of limited efficacy. Despite an association with poor outcomes and availability of effective therapy, most patients with HN are discharged from hospital still hyponatremic. Studies to assess short- and long-term benefits of correction of HN with effective therapies are needed.

### Rate of correction of hypernatremia and health outcomes in critically ill patients [^55d0eafc]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Hypernatremia is common in hospitalized, critically ill patients. Although there are no clear guidelines on sodium correction rate for hypernatremia, some studies suggest a reduction rate not to exceed 0.5 mmol/L per hour. However, the data supporting this recommendation and the optimal rate of hypernatremia correction in hospitalized adults are unclear.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We assessed the association of hypernatremia correction rates with neurologic outcomes and mortality in critically ill patients with hypernatremia at admission and those that developed hypernatremia during hospitalization. We used data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III and identified patients with hypernatremia (serum sodium level > 155 mmol/L) on admission (n = 122) and hospital-acquired (n = 327). We calculated different ranges of rapid correction rates (> 0.5 mmol/L per hour overall and > 8, > 10, and > 12 mmol/L per 24 hours) and utilized logistic regression to generate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) to examine association with outcomes.

Results

We had complete data on 122 patients with severe hypernatremia on admission and 327 patients who developed hospital-acquired hypernatremia. The difference in in-hospital 30-day mortality proportion between rapid (> 0.5 mmol/L per hour) and slower (≤ 0.5 mmol/L per hour) correction rates were not significant either in patients with hypernatremia at admission with rapid versus slow correction (25% versus 28%; P = 0.80) or in patients with hospital-acquired hypernatremia with rapid versus slow correction (44% versus 40%; P = 0.50). There was no difference in aOR of mortality for rapid versus slow correction in either admission (aOR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.5 to 3.7) or hospital-acquired hypernatremia (aOR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.8 to 2.3). Manual chart review of all suspected chronic hypernatremia patients, which included all 122 with hypernatremia at admission, 128 of the 327 hospital-acquired hypernatremia, and an additional 28 patients with ICD-9 codes for cerebral edema, seizures and/or alteration of consciousness, did not reveal a single case of cerebral edema attributable to rapid hyprnatremia correction.

Conclusions

We did not find any evidence that rapid correction of hypernatremia is associated with a higher risk for mortality, seizure, alteration of consciousness, and/or cerebral edema in critically ill adult patients with either admission or hospital-acquired hypernatremia.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to management of moderately symptomatic patients, ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to consider limiting the increase in serum sodium concentration to 10 mmol/L in the first 24 hours and 8 mmol/L during every 24 hours thereafter, until a serum sodium concentration of 130 mmol/L is reached.

### A low initial serum sodium level is associated with an increased risk of overcorrection in patients with chronic profound hyponatremia: a retrospective cohort analysis [^c932362c]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia, defined as a serum sodium (SNa) concentration of < 135 mEq/L, is a water balance disorder, with a relative excess of body water in relation to sodium. Some reports have classified SNa ≤ 125 mEq/L as "profound" hyponatremia. Since profound hyponatremia is also associated with fatal complications such as brain herniation, appropriate treatments for hyponatremia have been discussed intensively worldwide. For example, urgent therapy using hypertonic saline is justified in life-threatening conditions caused by hyponatremia complicated with seizures and coma. In contrast, the problem of overcorrection makes the treatment of hyponatremia difficult because it can provoke osmotic demyelination (ODS), which is a dreaded neurologic complication associated with high mortality. Therefore, the international guidelines recommend limiting the increase of SNa to within 10 mEq/L and 18 mEq/L during the first 24 and 48 h, respectively, from the initiation of treatment for hyponatremia. To achieve the ideal correction rate of hyponatremia, several strategies including administration of desmopressin acetate (DDAVP), 3% hypertonic saline in combination with DDAVP, and re-lowering the SNa with 5% dextrose in water (D5W) have been introduced. However, there is a paucity of literature on the risk factors for overcorrection, especially in "Chronic" profound hyponatremia, which carries a greater risk of neurologic complications from overcorrection, even though several risk factors for ODS have been identified, including SNa ≤ 105 mEq/L at presentation, overcorrection itself, malnutrition, hypokalemia, and liver disease. We hypothesized that the identification of risk factors for overcorrection can improve the safety and efficacy of the treatment of chronic hyponatremia.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^2784c628]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

As ODS can be a devastating outcome, overcorrection should be scrupulously avoided to reduce risk. For this reason, recommended sodium correction targets often err on the conservative side for safety, particularly in those with risk factors for ODS for whom a daily correction limit of 6 to 8 mmol/L per 24 hours is endorsed by US expert opinion guidelines (Table 4). It is the net 24-hour change in pNa rather than the precise hourly rate of correction that is most important.

Table 4.
Recommended plasma sodium concentration daily correction targets and limits in current hyponatremia guidelines

The management of patients who develop ODS is outside the scope of this review, but in brief, there are no established therapies. To maintain correction within the goal range, relowering of serum sodium with hypotonic fluid and/or desmopressin may be required if pNa targets are surpassed, and can still be beneficial even for those who have developed early symptoms of ODS (see "In Case of Overcorrection: Relowering of Plasma Sodium"). Case reports describe good outcomes after treatment of ODS with glucocorticoids, plasmapheresis, IV immunoglobulin, and zolpidem; however, it is unclear if improvements occurred as the result of these interventions. Glucocorticoids have been assessed in animal models of ODS and have shown reduced histological damage, but there are conflicting data with respect to mortality benefit. Nevertheless, glucocorticoid therapy after overcorrection is recommended in US expert guidelines for those with baseline a pNa less than 120 mmol/L. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that administration of osmolytes such as urea or myo-inositol can protect against myelinolysis but they are not routinely recommended for this particular indication (see "Urea" for urea use). Plasmapheresis, which may remove "myelotoxins" from the circulation, and/or restore organic osmolytes, is the experimental therapy most frequently reported to have benefit and requires further evaluation. Supportive care measures such as intubation and ventilation, and in patients who survive, prolonged neurorehabilitation may be required. Optimal management of ODS when it does occur is an important area for future research.

### Caution of overdependence on formulas while treating hyponatremia [^b4cd5c38]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Use of online formulas to treat hyponatremia is a common practice. We report here that while using the same goal of correction and type of infusate to treat a patient with hyponatremia, a large discrepancy in infusion rate is obtained from using the 2 commonly available online equations. When the therapy fluid is less concentrated saline (0.9%), Adrogue's formula poses the risk of large amount of volume being administered for only a small change in serum sodium concentration. This may be detrimental especially in patients with congestive heart failure. When the therapy fluid is hypertonic saline (3%), these formulas may result in overly rapid correction. We should, thus, never use these formulas blindly in the management of patients with hyponatremia.

### Current prescriptions for the correction of hyponatraemia and hypernatraemia: are they too simple? [^baf01796]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Hypo- and hypernatraemic (dysnatraemic) disorders are among the most common electrolyte disorders encountered by primary care providers and nephrologists. They represent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, and inappropriate management can result in serious sequelae. Several formulas addressing the fluid prescription for dysnatraemic patients have been introduced. Many authors stress the importance of considering output as well as input in formulating a treatment plan for the dysnatraemic patient. However, currently available formulas fail to account for ongoing renal and extrarenal fluid and electrolyte losses. We propose a novel, versatile formula based on established principles governing the distribution of Na(+) in body fluids. The formula can be used in a simplified form for a quick but accurate estimate of the change in serum [Na(+)] for any infused fluid, while simultaneously accounting for renal losses. The formula can also be expanded to include more complex losses if desired. Importantly, it forces the caregiver to consider both output and input when formulating a prescription for the dysnatraemic patient.

### Hypertonic saline for hyponatremia: risk of inadvertent overcorrection [^015d1386]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Data regarding dosage-response relationships for using hypertonic saline in treatment of hyponatremia are extremely limited. Objectives of this study were to assess adherence to previously published guidelines (limiting correction to < 12 mEq/L per d and < 18 mEq/L per 48 h) in treating hyponatremia with hypertonic saline and to determine the predictive accuracy of the Adrogué-Madias formula.

Design, Setting, Participants & Measurements

A retrospective review was conducted of all 62 adult, hyponatremic patients who were treated with hypertonic saline during 5 yr at a 528-bed, acute care, teaching hospital.

Results

Median infusion rate was 0.38 ml/kg per h, increasing serum sodium concentration by 0.47 ± 0.05 mEq/L per h, 7.1 ± 0.6 mEq/L per 24 h, and 11.3 ± 0.7 mEq/L per 48 h. In 11.3% of cases, the increase was > 12 mEq/L per 24 h and in 9.7% was > 18 mEq/L per 48 h. No patient's rate was corrected by > 25 mEq/L per 48 h. Among patients with serum sodium < 120 mEq/L, the observed increase in sodium exceeded the rise predicted by the Adrogué-Madias formula in 74.2%; the average correction in overcorrectors was 2.4 times the predicted. Inadvertent overcorrection was due to documented water diuresis in 40% of cases.

Conclusions

The Adrogué-Madias formula underestimates increase in sodium concentration after hypertonic saline therapy. Unrecognized hypovolemia and other reversible causes of water retention pose a risk for inadvertent overcorrection. Hypertonic saline should be infused at rates lower than those predicted by formulas with close monitoring of serum sodium and urine output.

Regarding medical management for arginine vasopressin deficiency, more specifically with respect to treatment goals, SE 2018 guidelines recommend to correct serum sodium at a rate of 5 mmol/L in the first hour (or until symptoms improve) and limited to 10 mmol/L per 24 hours in symptomatic patients with hypernatremia developed within 48 hours (acute hypernatremia).

### Risk of adverse clinical outcomes in hyponatremic adult patients hospitalized for acute medical conditions: a population-based cohort study [^f38858bd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Potential reasons for a possible "protective" role of SIAD are unclear and speculative. It has been shown that paradoxically, mortality rate seems to be lower in patients with pronounced hyponatremia (below 120 mmol/L) as compared to patients with a milder hyponatremia. Interestingly, the degree of hyponatremia varies according to hyponatremia etiology and notably, SIAD seems to predispose to very low sodium levels. In patients with sodium levels below 120 mmol/L, the therapeutic approach has been shown to be different, with a higher percentage of ICU admission and of hypertonic saline administration as well as a more rapid initial sodium correction rate. This could possibly explain the lower mortality rates but higher ICU admission rates in these patients. However, first, we do not have sufficient evidence that severe hyponatremia is more prevalent among SIAD patients and, second, we do not have exact sodium levels in our database to further underline this hypothesis. An alternative explanation for the "protective" role of SIAD might be the exact opposite, that is, that patients with SIAD had more mild hyponatremia. However, taking into account that hyponatremia awareness among physicians is low and that hyponatremia is therefore underreported in ICD-10 codes, we assume that mostly the severe cases, rather than the mild ones, were reported. Finally, we cannot definitively exclude that other essential factors that are more difficult to perceive and measure (such as the severity of the intercurrent diseases that led patients to hospitalization, the large spectrum of medical complications encountered by patients across hospitalization, or the proportion of patients receiving palliative care) might not have been distributed in a comparable way in both groups. Therefore, prospective interventional randomized trials are needed to prove a causal role of hyponatremia due to SIAD in patient prognosis.

### Lixivaptan safely and effectively corrects serum sodium concentrations in hospitalized patients with euvolemic hyponatremia [^343bcde4]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder associated with increased morbidity and mortality, particularly in the elderly. Lixivaptan, a new selective vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist, safely corrected serum sodium concentrations in phase II studies of patients with euvolemic hyponatremia. Here our multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III study assessed the effect of lixivaptan on serum sodium concentrations in 106 initially hospitalized patients with euvolemic hyponatremia (serum sodium less than 130 mmol/l). Of them, 52 were randomized to receive placebo and 54 received 50 mg lixivaptan once daily and were then titrated to receive 25–100 mg once daily depending on serum sodium concentration. Fluid restriction was at the investigator's discretion. Initial titration occurred in a monitored inpatient setting; patients were then treated as outpatients for a total of 30 days. The primary end point was the change in serum sodium concentration from baseline to day 7. Lixivaptan significantly increased the serum sodium concentration from baseline to day 7 (the primary end point) by 6.7 mmol/l compared with placebo (4.5 mmol/l; P = 0.034). Importantly, the serum sodium concentration was normalized safely and more rapidly in patients receiving lixivaptan than placebo (P = 0.004) and was well tolerated. After drug discontinuation, serum sodium concentrations decreased to near-baseline levels within 7 days. Thus, lixivaptan safely and effectively corrects serum sodium concentrations in patients with euvolemic hyponatremia.

### Diagnosis and management of disorders of body tonicity-hyponatremia and hypernatremia: core curriculum 2020 [^861c01c9]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Overall body fluid concentration is regulated within a narrow range by the concerted action of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis to influence water intake through thirst and water excretion via the effect of vasopressin, or antidiuretic hormone, on renal collecting duct water permeability. Sodium is the principal extracellular cation; abnormalities in overall effective body fluid concentration, or tonicity, manifest as disturbances in serum sodium concentration. Depending on its severity and chronicity, hyponatremia can lead to significant symptoms, primarily related to central nervous system function. Failure to correct hyponatremia can lead to permanent neurologic damage, as can over rapid correction. It is thus essential to stay within specific limits for correction, particularly for chronic hyponatremia. Hypernatremia also leads to central nervous system dysfunction, although goals for its correction rate are less well established. This Core Curriculum article discusses the normal regulation of tonicity and serum sodium concentration and the diagnosis and management of hypo- and hypernatremia.

### Recent developments in the management of acute and chronic hyponatremia [^02a35807]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of the study is to review recent studies on the management of acute and chronic hyponatremia.

Recent Findings

In acute symptomatic hyponatremia, bolus infusion of hypertonic saline improves hyponatremia and neurological status more quickly than continuous infusion. In chronic hyponatremia, newly identified predictors of nonresponse to fluid restriction include a high urine osmolality (> 500mOsm/kg) and high urine sodium (> 133mmol/l). Vasopressin-receptor antagonists effectively raise the serum sodium concentration in patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia but have a risk of overcorrection, even at low doses. Several observational studies now support the use of urea for a more gradual correction of hyponatremia without a risk of overcorrection. Recently identified risk factors for overcorrection include lower serum sodium at presentation, polydipsia, hypovolemia, and early urine output during treatment. Specific treatments with potential efficacy are the use of intravenous albumin for hyponatremia because of liver cirrhosis, and fludrocortisone for hyponatremia in tuberculous meningitis.

Summary

The recent data will help to further optimize and personalize the management of patients with acute and chronic hyponatremia. However, most data are still observational and retrospective. Therefore, the field is in need of prospective studies comparing interventions for chronic hyponatremia and focusing on patient-relevant outcomes.

### Clinical management of SIADH [^9c2d486a]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most frequent electrolyte disorder and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) accounts for approximately one-third of all cases. In the diagnosis of SIADH it is important to ascertain the euvolemic state of extracellular fluid volume, both clinically and by laboratory measurements. SIADH should be treated to cure symptoms. While this is undisputed in the presence of grave or advanced symptoms, the clinical role and the indications for treatment in the presence of mild to moderate symptoms are currently unclear. Therapeutic modalities include nonspecific measures and means (fluid restriction, hypertonic saline, urea, demeclocycline), with fluid restriction and hypertonic saline commonly used. Recently vasopressin receptor antagonists, called vaptans, have been introduced as specific and direct therapy of SIADH. Although clinical experience with vaptans is limited at this time, they appear advantageous to patients because there is no need for fluid restriction and the correction of hyponatremia can be achieved comfortably and within a short time. Vaptans also appear to be beneficial for physicians and staff because of their efficiency and reliability. The side effects are thirst, polydipsia and frequency of urination. In any therapy of chronic SIADH it is important to limit the daily increase of serum sodium to less than 8–10 mmol/liter because higher correction rates have been associated with osmotic demyelination. In the case of vaptan treatment, the first 24 h are critical for prevention of an overly rapid correction of hyponatremia and the serum sodium should be measured after 0, 6, 24 and 48 h of treatment. Discontinuation of any vaptan therapy for longer than 5 or 6 days should be monitored to prevent hyponatremic relapse. It may be necessary to taper the vaptan dose or restrict fluid intake or both.

### Hyponatremia demystified: integrating physiology to shape clinical practice [^4781b0ea]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is one of the most common problems encountered in clinical practice and one of the least-understood because accurate diagnosis and management require some familiarity with water homeostasis physiology, making the topic seemingly complex. The prevalence of hyponatremia depends on the nature of the population studied and the criteria used to define it. Hyponatremia is associated with poor outcomes including increased mortality and morbidity. The pathogenesis of hypotonic hyponatremia involves the accumulation of electrolyte-free water caused by either increased intake and/or decrease in kidney excretion. Plasma osmolality, urine osmolality, and urine sodium can help to differentiate among the different etiologies. Brain adaptation to plasma hypotonicity consisting of solute extrusion to mitigate further water influx into brain cells best explains the clinical manifestations of hyponatremia. Acute hyponatremia has an onset within 48 hours, commonly resulting in severe symptoms, while chronic hyponatremia develops over 48 hours and usually is pauci-symptomatic. However, the latter increases the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome if hyponatremia is corrected rapidly; therefore, extreme caution must be exercised when correcting plasma sodium. Management strategies depend on the presence of symptoms and the cause of hyponatremia and are discussed in this review.

### Where Do the salt and water Go? A case of profound hyponatremia [^3661cbcd]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment of profound hyponatremia is challenging. Severe symptoms mandate correction by 4 to 6 mEq/L within hours, but with risk factors for osmotic demyelination, daily correction should be < 8 mEq/L. With a therapeutic window this narrow, clinicians would like to know how serum sodium (SNa) concentration will respond to their therapy. Based on isotopic measurements, Edelman showed SNa level to be a function of exchangeable sodium and potassium divided by total-body water. Edelman defined this relationship with linear regression yielding an equation of the form y = mx + b, where y is SNa level, x is exchangeable sodium and potassium divided by total-body water, m is the slope, and b is the intercept. Edelman said that the intercept of his regression "probably is a measure of the quantity of osmotically inactive exchangeable sodium and potassium per unit of body water". Predictive formulas are derived from Edelman's original linear regression, some including and some omitting the regression's intercept. We illustrate the performance and limitations of these formulas using comprehensive data for electrolyte and fluid balance obtained during the treatment of a critically patient who presented with an SNa concentration of 101 mEq/L.

### Diagnosing and treating the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion [^94c62697]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion is the most common cause of hyponatremia in clinical practice, but current management of hyponatremia and outcomes in patients with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion are not well understood. The objective of the Hyponatremia Registry was to assess the current state of management of hyponatremia due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in diverse hospital settings, specifically which diagnostic and treatment modalities are currently used and how rapidly and reliably they result in an increase in serum sodium concentration ([Na(+)]). A secondary objective was to determine whether treatment choices and outcomes differ across the United States and the European Union.

Methods

The Hyponatremia Registry recorded selected diagnostic measures and use, efficacy, and outcomes of therapy for euvolemic hyponatremia diagnosed clinically as syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in 1524 adult patients with [Na(+)] ≤ 130 mEq/L (1034 from 146 US sites and 490 from 79 EU sites). A subgroup of patients with more rigorously defined syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion via measurement of relevant laboratory parameters was also analyzed.

Results

The most common monotherapy treatments for hyponatremia in syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion were fluid restriction (48%), isotonic (27%) or hypertonic (6%) saline, and tolvaptan (13%); 11% received no active agent. The mean rate of [Na(+)] change (mEq/L/d) was greater for all active therapies than no active treatment. Hypertonic saline and tolvaptan produced the greatest mean rate of [Na(+)] change (interquartile range, both 3.0 [6.0] mEq/L/d) compared with lower interquartile range rates of [Na(+)] change for isotonic saline (1.5 [3.0] mEq/L/d) and fluid restriction (1.0 [2.3] mEq/L/d). The general pattern of responses was similar in both the US and EU cohorts. At discharge, [Na(+)] was < 135 mEq/L in 75% of patients and ≤ 130 mEq/L in 43% of patients. Overly rapid correction occurred in 10.2% of patients.

Conclusions

Current treatment of hyponatremia in syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion often uses therapies with limited efficacy; the most commonly chosen monotherapy treatments, fluid restriction and isotonic saline, failed to increase the serum [Na(+)] by ≥ 5 mEq/L in 55% and 64% of monotherapy treatment episodes, respectively. Appropriate laboratory tests to diagnose syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion were obtained in < 50% of patients; success rates in correcting hyponatremia were significantly higher when such tests were obtained. Few outcome differences were found between the United States and the European Union. A notable exception was hospital length of stay; use of tolvaptan was associated with significantly shorter length of stay in the European Union but not in the United States. Despite the availability of effective therapies, most patients with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion were discharged from the hospital still hyponatremic.

### Hyponatraemia-treatment standard 2024 [^09dfc4bb]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyponatraemia is the most common electrolyte disorder in hospital patients associated with increased morbidity, mortality, hospital stay and financial burden. The speed of a correction with 3% sodium chloride as a 100- to 150-ml intravenous bolus or continuous infusion depends on the severity and persistence of the symptoms and needs frequent biochemical monitoring. The rapid intermittent administration of hypertonic saline is preferred for treatment of symptomatic hyponatraemia. In asymptomatic mild hyponatraemia, an adequate solute intake with an initial fluid restriction (FR) of 500 ml/day adjusted according to the serum sodium (sNa) levels is preferred. Almost half of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) patients do not respond to FR as first-line therapy. At present, urea and tolvaptan are considered the most effective second-line therapies in SIADH. However, the evidence for guidance on the choice of second-line therapy of hypotonic hyponatraemia is lacking. Oral urea is considered to be a very effective and safe treatment. Mild and asymptomatic hyponatraemia is treated with adequate solute intake (salt and protein) and initial FR with adjustments based on sNa levels. Specific treatment with vaptans may be considered in either euvolaemic or hypervolaemic patients with high ADH activity. In order to ensure optimal patient outcome, close monitoring and readiness for administration of either hypotonic fluids or desmopressin may be crucial in the decision-making process for specific treatment and eventual overcorrection consequences. According to the guidelines, gradual correction and clinical evaluation is preferable over rapid normalization of sNa towards the laboratory reference ranges.

### Dysnatremia, its correction, and mortality in patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy: a prospective observational study [^b56600bc]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Although dysnatremia has been reported to be correlated with mortality risk, this issue remains unresolved in patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Furthermore, it has not been determined whether change in or correction of sodium is related to mortality risk in this subset.

Methods

A total of 569 patients were prospectively enrolled at the start of CRRT between May 2010 and September 2013. The patients were divided into 5 groups: normonatremia (135–145 mmol/L), mild hyponatremia (131.1–134.9 mmol/L), moderate to severe hyponatremia (115.4–131.0 mmol/L), mild hypernatremia (145.1–148.4 mmol/L), and moderate to severe hypernatremia (148.5–166.0 mmol/L). The non-linear relationship between sodium and mortality was initially explored. Subsequently, the odds ratios (ORs) for 30-day mortality were calculated after adjustment of multiple covariates.

Results

The relationship between baseline sodium and mortality was U-shaped. The mild hyponatremia, moderate to severe hyponatremia, and moderate to severe hypernatremia groups had greater ORs for mortality (1.65, 1.91, and 2.32, respectively) than the normonatremia group (all P values < 0.05). However, later sodium levels (24 and 72 h after CRRT) did not predict 30-day mortality. Furthermore, the changes in sodium over 24 or 72 h, including the appropriate correction of dysnatremia, did not show any relationships with mortality, irrespective of baseline sodium level.

Conclusions

Sodium level at the start of CRRT was a strong predictor of mortality. However, changes in sodium level and the degree of sodium correction were not associated with the mortality risk in the patients with CRRT.

### Correction rate matters in severe hyponatremia… [^0626af40]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor We read with great interest the systematic review and meta-analysis by Ayus et al1 investigating the association between sodium correction rates and clinical outcomes in patients with severe hyponatremia. The authors found that rapid correction was associated with lower mortality and shorter hospital stay compared to slower correction rates, without a significantly increased risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome. While we appreciate the authors' rigorous methods and important findings, we believe that certain limitations warrant further discussion to enhance the clinical applicability of the conclusions.

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^c44ba828]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to management of mildly symptomatic patients (chronic setting), ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to avoid increasing serum sodium concentration of > 10 mmol/L during the first 24 hours, or > 8 mmol/L during every subsequent 24-hour period in patients with moderate or profound hyponatremia.

### Hypertonic saline and desmopressin: a simple strategy for safe correction of severe hyponatremia [^1eea8c2b]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Prompt correction of severe hyponatremia is important, but correction also must be limited to avoid iatrogenic osmotic demyelination. Expert opinion recommends that serum sodium level not be increased by more than 10–12 mEq/L in any 24-hour period and/or 18 mEq/L in any 48-hour period. However, inadvertent overcorrection is common, usually caused by the unexpected emergence of a water diuresis.

Study Design

Quality improvement report.

Setting & Participants

All 25 patients admitted to a community teaching hospital between October 1, 2008, and September 30, 2011, who were treated for serum sodium level < 120 mEq/L with concurrently administered desmopressin and hypertonic saline solution.

Quality Improvement Plan

Concurrently administered desmopressin (1–2 µg parenterally every 6–8 hours) and hypertonic saline with weight-based doses adjusted to increase the serum sodium concentration by 6 mEq/L, avoiding inadvertent overcorrection of severe hyponatremia.

Outcomes

Rate of correction of hyponatremia, predictability of response to the combination, adverse events related to therapy.

Measurements

Rate of correction of hyponatremia at 4, 24, and 48 hours; administered dose of 3% saline solution, salt tablets, and potassium; predicted increase in serum sodium level.

Results

Mean changes in serum sodium levels during the first and second 24 hours of therapy were 5.8 ± 2.8 (SD) and 4.5 ± 2.2 mEq/L, respectively, without correction by > 12 mEq/L in 24 hours or > 18 mEq/L in 48 hours and without a decrease during therapy. There was no significant difference between actual and predicted increases during the first 24 hours. There was no adverse effect associated with therapy.

Limitations

Without concurrent controls, we cannot be certain that outcomes are improved. Balance studies were not performed.

Conclusions

Combined 3% saline solution and desmopressin appears to be a valid strategy for correcting severe hyponatremia, but studies comparing the regimen with other therapeutic strategies are needed.

### Mild chronic hyponatremia in the ambulatory setting: significance and management [^be299382]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Mild chronic hyponatremia, as defined by a persistent (> 72 hours) plasma sodium concentration between 125 and 135 mEq/L without apparent symptoms, is common in ambulatory patients and generally perceived as being inconsequential. The association between increased mortality and hyponatremia in hospitalized patients in various settings and etiologies is widely recognized. This review analyzes the significance of mild chronic hyponatremia in ambulatory subjects and its effects on mortality and morbidity. It addresses whether this disorder should even be treated and if so, which patients are likely to benefit from treatment. The available approaches to correct hyponatremia in such patients in the context of recently published panel-generated recommendations and guidelines are described.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^e1611723]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

We found five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements covering the diagnostic approach to and treatment of hyponatremia. Although most used serum osmolality, volume status, urinary sodium, and urinary osmolality to guide differential diagnosis, they differed in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Most advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset hyponatremia and NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. However, they somewhat differed in the limits for speed of increase in serum sodium concentration and which specific medications to use. The reasons for offering different recommendations are undoubtedly multifactorial. They may in part be explained by the fact that recommendations were issued by organizations differing in context and scope. It is also very likely that some variability in guidance arose through limitations in the evidence available for guideline developers to base their recommendations on. In the most recent guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, 98% of the graded recommendations were based on very low and low level of evidence, while none were based on a high level of evidence. The lack of high quality evidence may have increased the part opinion had to play in framing the recommendations. In addition, the evidence that was available may have been interpreted differently dependent on the importance for decision making given to certain outcomes (e.g. serum sodium concentration). Finally, differences in personal experience due to differing availability of medications may partly explain possible differences in perception of uncertainties around drug safety.

### Clinical factors associated with hyponatremia correction during treatment with oral urea [^c07aa03b]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

The efficacy of oral urea was reported as early as the 1980s, but its use remained rather limited. In recent years oral urea was "rediscovered", with several observational studies reporting positive experiences for the treatment of hyponatremia. A recent systematic review confirmed that oral urea is an effective, safe and inexpensive treatment option for SIAD despite the lack of data from randomized controlled trials.

With the use of oral urea for SIAD becoming more widespread, it is also becoming increasingly important to better understand which clinical factors determine the hyponatremia correction rate during treatment. For example, several studies have shown that a lower baseline plasma sodium concentration predicts more rapid correction of hyponatremia, but it is not known whether this also pertains to treatment with oral urea. Previous studies also identified specific parameters that were associated with the response to therapy, including urine osmolality for fluid restriction and body weight for hypertonic saline. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate which clinical factors are associated with hyponatremia correction. To address this, we analyzed the hyponatremia correction rate during oral urea treatment in 140 patients from two university medical centers.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to management of severely symptomatic patients (inadequate response to initial management), ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to consider measuring serum sodium concentration every 4 hours as long as an IV infusion of 3% hypertonic saline is continued.

### Rate of correction and all-cause mortality in patients with severe hypernatremia [^f21e5a80]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Hypernatremia is common among hospitalized patients and is associated with high mortality rates. Current guidelines suggest avoiding fast correction rates but are not supported by robust data.

Objective

To investigate whether there is an association between hypernatremia correction rate and patient survival.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study examined data from all patients admitted to the Tel Aviv Medical Center between 2007 and 2021 who were diagnosed with severe hypernatremia (serum sodium ≥ 155 mmol/L) at admission or during hospitalization. Statistical analysis was performed from April 2022 to August 2023.

Exposure

Patients were grouped as having fast correction rates (> 0.5 mmol/L/h) and slow correction rates (≤ 0.5 mmol/L/h) in accordance with current guidelines.

Main Outcomes and Measures

All-cause 30-day mortality.

Results

A total of 4265 patients were included in this cohort, of which 2621 (61.5%) were men and 343 (8.0%) had fast correction rates; the median (IQR) age at diagnosis was 78 (64–87) years. Slow correction was associated with higher 30-day mortality compared with fast correction (50.7% [1990 of 3922] vs 31.8% [109 of 343]; P < .001). These results remained significant after adjusting for demographics (age, gender), Charlson comorbidity index, initial sodium, potassium, and creatinine levels, hospitalization in an ICU, and severe hyperglycemia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.02 [95% CI, 1.55–2.62]), regardless of whether hypernatremia was hospital acquired (aOR, 2.19 [95% CI, 1.57–3.05]) or documented on admission (aOR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.06–2.55]). There was a strong negative correlation between absolute sodium correction during the first 24 hours following the initial documentation of severe hypernatremia and 30-day mortality (Pearson correlation coefficient, -0.80 [95% CI, -0.93 to -0.50]; P < .001). Median (IQR) hospitalization length was shorter for fast correction vs slow correction rates (5.0 [2.1–14.9] days vs 7.2 [3.5–16.1] days; P < .001). Prevalence of neurological complications was comparable for both groups, and none were attributed to fast correction rates of hypernatremia.

Conclusions and Relevance

This cohort study of patients with severe hypernatremia found that rapid correction of hypernatremia was associated with shorter hospitalizations and significantly lower patient mortality without any signs of neurologic complications. These results suggest that physicians should consider the totality of evidence when considering the optimal rates of correction for patients with severe hypernatremia.

### Principles of management of severe hyponatremia [^f3154383]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Accurate diagnosis of the cause, pathogenesis and chronicity, and monitoring during treatment are the critical parts of the management of severe hyponatremias. We stress that calculation errors are possible even with the best formulas, and frequent monitoring of the patient during therapy is absolutely essential to ensure optimal chances for recovery.
