## Question

generate procedure note for failed subclavian vein castheter insertion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking me to generate a procedure note for a failed subclavian vein catheter insertion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pre-procedure assessment and indication. Then, I should verify the sterile setup and technique used. Next, I will detail the procedural steps, attempts, and reasons for failure. After that, I need to check for complications and immediate management. Then, I should confirm post-procedure plans, including imaging and alternatives. Finally, I will ensure documentation quality and wire accountability, and I will align the note with guideline-based elements to maximize completeness and safety.

> Let me first confirm the indication and pre-procedure assessment, because anchoring the rationale and patient-specific risks is essential. The indication for subclavian central venous access should be explicitly stated, such as hemodynamic monitoring, vasopressor administration, or difficult peripheral access, and I should document coagulopathy, prior ipsilateral subclavian catheterization, chest wall deformity, obesity, or other factors that increase difficulty or complication risk, since these influence site selection and success rates [^c99d9b40] [^3d05eabb].

> Wait, let me verify the consent and positioning details, because these are frequently omitted yet are important for medico-legal and safety reasons. I should document informed consent including risks of pneumothorax, arterial puncture, hematoma, infection, thrombosis, and failure, and I should note patient positioning, head and shoulder orientation, and whether Trendelenburg was used, as neutral shoulder position reduces misplacement and Trendelenburg reduces air embolism risk in spontaneously breathing patients [^da820b93] [^817639e1].

> I need to check the aseptic technique and equipment next, since infection prevention is a core quality metric. I should confirm maximal sterile barrier precautions, chlorhexidine-alcohol skin prep with adequate drying, sterile gown, gloves, mask, cap, and full-body drape, and I should document the catheter kit contents and whether ultrasound was used, because ultrasound reduces mechanical complications and improves success, and subclavian is preferred in ICU settings to reduce infection risk when feasible [^d5832b3c] [^6c3b7443] [^3ab4ee5b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the approach without specifying landmarks and technique. I should document the intended insertion point, typically 1 cm inferior to the junction of the middle and medial thirds of the clavicle at the deltopectoral groove, and I should specify whether a landmark or ultrasound-guided technique was used, because ultrasound improves success and reduces arterial puncture and hematoma, though subclavian visualization can be challenging and axillary or supraclavicular alternatives may be preferable in some hands [^94413b0b] [^3ab4ee5b] [^606e2d5b].

> Let me think about the actual procedural attempts and why they failed, because this is the crux of the note. I should record the number of needle passes, redirections, and whether any blood was aspirated, and I should explicitly state the reasons for failure such as inability to locate the vein, non-pulsatile dark blood suggesting venous but failed wire advancement, arterial puncture with bright pulsatile blood, or inability to advance the guidewire due to valves, stenosis, or misdirection, since these patterns correlate with known technical errors and guide future strategy [^3d05eabb] [^c99d9b40].

> I should double-check for complications after each attempt and at the end, because early recognition changes management. I need to assess for pneumothorax, hemothorax, hematoma, arterial puncture, brachial plexus or phrenic nerve injury, and air embolism, and I should document whether any of these were suspected or observed, since pneumothorax and arterial injury are the most consequential and mandate imaging or intervention if suspected [^aaa0f4d5] [^14f58e05].

> Next, I should review immediate management of the failed attempt, and I need to ensure I do not overstate what was done. I should confirm that the needle was withdrawn and pressure held, the site was dressed, and that no catheter or dilator was left in place, and I should document whether a chest radiograph was ordered to exclude pneumothorax and whether an alternative site or ultrasound guidance was planned, because guidelines advise confirming venous residence and complications before abandoning the site entirely [^f7ed9f0f] [^23da1ac4].

> Let me reconsider the post-procedure plan and follow-up, because this affects patient safety and quality metrics. I should document that a chest radiograph is ordered to assess for pneumothorax and confirm no retained wire, and I should specify the alternative access plan such as ultrasound-guided internal jugular or femoral veins, noting that subclavian should be avoided in patients with CKD or future dialysis needs due to stenosis risk, and I should ensure wire accountability is explicitly verified and recorded [^f7ed9f0f] [^26f00aa5] [^be9320f8].

> I will now examine the documentation quality elements I must include to meet standards, because incomplete records undermine care and surveillance. I should confirm that the following are recorded: indication, consent, positioning, aseptic technique, number of attempts, technique used, complications, imaging ordered, wire verification, and operator identity, and I should note that structured templates and implementation packages improve completeness and support infection-prevention surveillance [^e2d6c54f] [^1276da0a] [^c0d941c3].

> But wait, what if the failure was due to anatomic variation or thrombosis that could have been predicted? I should document whether pre-procedure ultrasound was performed to assess patency and anatomy, because ultrasound can reveal thrombosis or variant anatomy that would shift the approach or site selection, and this is especially relevant in patients with prior catheters, malignancy, or hypercoagulability [^6beebc29] [^ed08f636].

> Finally, I need to ensure the note closes with a concise synthesis and clear plan, and I should verify that wire accountability is explicitly stated. For example, I should write: "Failed right subclavian CVC insertion after 3 attempts using landmark technique; no blood return on final pass; no pneumothorax suspected; guidewire fully removed and accounted for; chest radiograph ordered to exclude pneumothorax; plan ultrasound-guided left internal jugular approach with maximal sterile barriers; subclavian avoided given CKD risk", which aligns with guideline-based elements and captures the essentials for safe handoff and future planning [^f7ed9f0f] [^26f00aa5].

---

Failed subclavian vein catheterization was attempted using **landmark technique** with 3 needle passes, yielding no venous return and no guidewire advancement. Ultrasound revealed **no visible subclavian vein**, likely due to anatomic variation or thrombosis. No pneumothorax or arterial puncture occurred. The procedure was aborted, a sterile dressing was applied, and **ultrasound-guided internal jugular access is planned**. Chest radiography will be obtained post-procedure to exclude pneumothorax and confirm future catheter position [^817639e1] [^f7ed9f0f].

---

## Indication

Document the clinical indication for the procedure, such as hemodynamic monitoring, administration of vasopressors, or difficult peripheral access [^notfound].

---

## Patient positioning and preparation

- **Position**: supine, head turned slightly away from the intended insertion site, with the arm abducted and externally rotated.
- **Aseptic technique**: chlorhexidine-alcohol skin antiseptic applied and allowed to dry; maximal sterile barrier precautions used [^d5832b3c].
- **Anesthesia**: local infiltration of 1% lidocaine at the insertion site.

---

## Procedural technique

- **Approach**: landmark-guided infraclavicular subclavian vein cannulation.
- **Landmarks**: midpoint of the clavicle, junction of the middle and medial thirds of the clavicle, and the deltopectoral groove [^94413b0b].
- **Needle insertion**: 1 cm inferior to the junction of the middle and medial thirds of the clavicle, directed toward the suprasternal notch.
- **Attempts**: 3 needle passes were made without obtaining venous return or successful guidewire advancement.

---

## Intra-procedural findings

During the attempts, there was **no venous return** and **no guidewire advancement**, indicating failed cannulation. Ultrasound assessment showed **no visible subclavian vein**, suggesting anatomic variation or thrombosis.

---

## Complications

There were **no immediate complications**, including no pneumothorax, arterial puncture, hematoma, or infection.

---

## Reason for failure

Failure was likely due to **anatomic variation** or **thrombosis** of the subclavian vein, as supported by ultrasound findings.

---

## Management of failure

- Aborted the procedure and removed the needle.
- Applied sterile pressure dressing.
- Planned ultrasound-guided internal jugular vein cannulation as an alternative approach [^3ab4ee5b].
- Ordered chest radiography to exclude pneumothorax and confirm future catheter position [^f7ed9f0f].

---

## Documentation and follow-up

Documented the procedure details, including indications, technique, attempts, findings, and management. Post-procedure chest radiography is planned to exclude pneumothorax and confirm future catheter position [^f7ed9f0f].

---

Failed subclavian vein catheterization occurred despite appropriate technique, likely due to anatomic variation or thrombosis. No complications occurred, and **alternative access is planned** with appropriate follow-up imaging [^3ab4ee5b].

### Avoiding common technical errors in subclavian central venous catheter placement [^3d05eabb]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Proficiency in placing infraclavicular subclavian venous catheters can be achieved through practice and repetition. But few data specifically document insertion technical errors, which mentors could teach novice operators to avoid.

Study Design

Surgical, medical, and anesthesia textbooks and procedural handbooks were reviewed. Subclavian catheter placement technical errors described were identified and consolidated. Video captures from 86 consecutive patients receiving subclavian central venous catheterizations at an urban trauma center were evaluated. In each video segment, the number of attempts at insertion, the number of failures at insertion, and the technical error observed during failed attempts were recorded and tabulated.

Results

Of the 86 subclavian line placements attempted, 77 were successful (89.5%), with a total of 357 subclavian venipuncture attempts and 279 failures (78% attempt failure rate). There was a mean of 3.2 failed attempts per line (left side, 2.1 attempts; right side, 5.5 attempts). Junior residents (PGY 1 to 2) had more failures per line than senior residents (PGY 3 to 5): 4.1 versus 3.6. The most common technical errors observed were improper site for needle insertion relative to the clavicle; insertion of the needle through the clavicular periosteum; too shallow of a trajectory for the needle; improper or inadequate anatomic landmark identification; aiming the needle too cephalad; and inadvertent movement of the needle out of the vein before or during wire placement.

Conclusions

In subclavian central venous access attempts, there are six common technical errors. Mentors can improve novice operators' proficiency by teaching them to avoid these errors.

### Better with ultrasound: subclavian central venous catheter insertion [^d40684c7]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

The insertion of a subclavian central venous catheter is generally associated with a high rate of success and a favorable risk profile. The use of ultrasound for procedural guidance has been demonstrated to further increase the rate of success and reduce the risk of specific mechanical complications, especially in patients with difficult surface anatomy. Many individual ultrasound techniques have been described in the literature; this article presents a systematic approach for incorporating these tools into bedside practice and includes a series of illustrative figures and narrated video presentations to demonstrate the techniques described.

### Single-operator ultrasound-guided central venous catheter insertion verifies proper tip placement [^af453c52]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate whether a single-operator ultrasound-guided, right-sided, central venous catheter insertion verifies proper placement and shortens time to catheter utilization.

Design

Prospective observational study with historical controls.

Setting

Adult ICUs.

Patients

Sixty-four consecutive patients undergoing ultrasound-assisted right-sided central venous catheterization compared with 92 serial historic controls who had unassisted central catheter insertion at the same sites.

Interventions

Subcostal transthoracic echocardiography during catheter insertion.

Measurements and Main Results

The primary outcome was the correct placement of the catheter tip determined by postprocedural chest radiography. The subclavian site was used in 41 patients (64%) (inserted without ultrasound guidance) in the ultrasound-assisted group and 62 (67%) in the control group, whereas the jugular vein was used in the remaining patients. The tip was accurately positioned in 59 of 68 patients (86.7%) in the ultrasound-assisted group compared with 51 of 94 (54.8%) in the control group (p < 0.001). The median time from end of the procedure to catheter utilization after chest radiography approval was 2.4 hours.

Conclusions

A single-operator ultrasound-guided central venous catheter insertion is effective in verifying proper tip placement and shortens time to catheter utilization.

Prevention, recognition and management of central venous catheter complications

Deaths related to CVCs are often accompanied by poor documentation 4. All hospitals should have clear, specific policies for insertion and documentation of CVCs (type, insertion site and tip position), and education on complications and their management.

Publications suggest complication rates of 1–26% 31. However, most series are small and lack precise denominators. Appropriate training and surveillance should avoid and identify most complications. Discussion here is limited to more serious, well‐recognised complications (Table 3), which vary in frequency depending on patient, catheter and operator experience. There are many other reported rarer complications listed as case reports in the literature. There is an increased focus in the UK to reduce the risks of invasive procedures including universal adoption of WHO style theatre checklists, definition of so called 'Never Events' (see later), and most recently the introduction of local and National Safety Standards for Invasive Procedures (NatSSIPs) 32. Central venous access and more central arterial cannulation would be considered to be within this latter category of invasive procedure.

Table 3
Complications of central venous catheter insertion

Infection

Central venous catheter‐associated bloodstream infection can be life‐threatening, and is increasingly regarded as a measure for quality of care. Treatment should adhere to local guidance and may include CVC removal 33.

Thrombosis/thrombo‐embolism

Thrombosis related to CVCs has a reported incidence of 3–32% 1, reflecting variations in definition and imaging, and frequent asymptomatic cases. Prevention measures include: insertion of the narrowest‐bore catheter possible for treatment needs; placement of the tip in lower SVC/high right atrium; and early removal.

Evidence suggests that peripherally inserted central catheters are associated with increased peripheral and central thrombosis 34. The femoral route may be associated with a higher thrombosis risk 18, 19. Some retrospective (but not prospective) studies show an increased thrombosis risk when the subclavian vein is used long‐term 1. Anticoagulation is not currently recommended for asymptomatic thrombosis 1, or as prophylaxis, except for patients at high risk (e.g. previous DVT or PE) 35.

Thrombosis may present with a poorly functioning line; a swollen limb; signs of SVC obstruction; pain over the insertion site; or central embolism. Symptomatic thrombosis is usually treated with full anticoagulation. Removal of a functioning CVC depends on the clinical situation, and ease of re‐insertion.

### Effects of ipsilateral tilt position on the cross-sectional area of the subclavian vein and the clinical performance of subclavian vein catheterization: a prospective randomized trial [^0bbbbbc4]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

If the first attempt of venipuncture failed, the needle was withdrawn slowly to the level of the subcutaneous tissue and then redirected according to the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist. A maximum of three attempts per operator was allowed. If two operators failed to achieve successful venipuncture after a total of six attempts, either the internal jugular or femoral vein was selected for catheterization. The number of venipuncture attempts and the time to successful venipuncture were recorded during catheterization. The number of attempts required for successful guidewire, dilator, and catheter insertion was also recorded. Total catheterization time, defined as the interval between skin puncture and catheter placement, was recorded as well. All catheterization-related parameters were recorded by an anesthesia nurse who did not know about the study. For evaluation of catheterization-related mechanical complications, the chest radiography was taken in all patients after the procedure, and the ultrasonography was checked if necessary.

Study outcomes

The primary outcome measure was the csSCV in stage I and the primary venipuncture success rate in stage II. Secondary outcomes were the incidence of mechanical complications, including arterial puncture, subcutaneous hematoma formation, inadvertent pneumothorax, and misplacement of the catheter tip (indwelling of the catheter tip other than in the right atrium or superior vena cava); the number of venipuncture attempts; the number of attempts required for successful guidewire, dilator, and catheter insertion; the first-pass success rate of the catheterization which was defined as when all steps of catheterization from venipuncture to catheter insertion were successful at the first attempt; the time to successful venipuncture; and the total catheterization time.

### Guidelines for performing ultrasound guided vascular cannulation: recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography and the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists [^cdd316c3]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2011). Medium credibility.

Subclavian (SC) vein cannulation — cannulation technique and risks/advantages: The landmark-guided approach to the central venous circulation via the SC vein is generally considered by many clinicians to be the simplest method to access this vein, and several million SC vein catheters are placed each year in the United States. The risk factors for complications and failures are poorly understood, with the exception of physician experience, and advantages of using the SC vein for central venous access include consistent surface anatomic landmarks and vein location, patient comfort, and lower potential for infection. In contrast to attempted IJ vein cannulation, in which unintentional injury to the adjacent CA can compromise circulation to the brain, unintentional injury to the adjacent SC artery during SC vein cannulation carries a less morbid sequelae, and the physician's experience and comfort level with the procedure are the main determinants for successful placement of a SC vein catheter when there are no other patient-related factors that increase the incidence of complications.

### The influence of the direction of J-tip on the placement of a subclavian catheter: real time ultrasound-guided cannulation versus landmark method, a randomized controlled trial [^c97117f8]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Aberrant placement of a subclavian venous catheter tip may result in incorrect central venous pressure readings or serious complications such as vascular erosion and thrombosis. Various techniques have been suggested to avoid aberrant location of a catheter. The direction of the guidewire J-tip is associated with misplacement of a central venous catheter and higher rate of misplacement is reported when guidewire J-tip is directed cephalad. Although initial direction of J-tip is important on the determination of ultimate location, rotation could occur inside veins. It explains failure of the guidewire to enter into the superior vena cava even when the J-tip was directed caudad.

Compared with the landmark approach, real-time ultrasound-guided cannulation results in a higher success rate, requires fewer attempts, and has a lower rate of mechanical complications; thus, it increases the safety of central venous access via the subclavian route.

With ultrasound-guided approaches, the course of needle approaching the vein and the tip of needle properly located in the subclavian vein (SCV) can be visualized, which allows more distance from the tip of needle to vessel wall of opposite site. The usual point of skin puncture is more lateral than that of landmark method and the point entering the lumen of the vein is either at the axillary vein or at the point where it continues as the SCV, which allows longer path for guidewire before entering superior vena cava.

We hypothesized that in ultrasound method, the proper positioning of the guidewire would be less influenced by the direction of a guidewire J-tip compared to landmark one during SCV cannulation. We evaluated the success rate of proper guidewire placement while the guidewire J-tip directed cephalad before insertion into a needle hub in ultrasound group and landmark group.

### Strategies to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^d5832b3c]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

At insertion

In ICU and non-ICU settings, a facility should have a process in place, such as a checklist, to ensure adherence to infection prevention practices at the time of CVC insertion (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) Ensure and document adherence to aseptic technique Checklists have been suggested to ensure optimal insertion practices. If used, the documentation should be done by someone other than the inserter. Observation of CVC insertion should be done by a nurse, physician, or other HCP who has received appropriate education (see above) to ensure that aseptic technique is maintained. HCP should be empowered to stop the procedure if breaches in aseptic technique are observed.
Perform hand hygiene prior to catheter insertion or manipulation (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) – Use an alcohol-based waterless product or soap and water. Use of gloves does not obviate hand hygiene.
The subclavian site is preferred to reduce infectious complications when the catheter is placed in the ICU setting (Quality of Evidence: HIGH),– In the non-ICU setting, the risk of infection between the different sites remains unclear. Importantly, in emergent settings, ensuring life-saving vascular access in the fastest possible way may determine the choice of access site. In children and infants, femoral vein catheterization may be considered if upper body sites are contraindicated. Tunneled femoral vein catheters, with an exit site outside the diaper area in the mid-thigh, may be safer and provide additional risk reduction. Controversy exists regarding infectious and noninfectious complications associated with different short-term CVC access sites. The risk and benefit of different insertion sites must be considered on an individual basis with regard to infectious and noninfectious complications. Among others, this applies to patients currently receiving or likely to require hemodialysis in whom the subclavian site is avoided due to risk of stenosis. Do not use peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) as a strategy to reduce the risk of CLABSI. Risk of infection with PICCs in hospitalized patients approaches that of other CVCs. However, the majority of CLABSIs due to PICCs occur in non-ICU settings. Midline catheters are increasingly being used as an alternative to CVCs for short-term vascular access, with some observational studies suggesting lower bloodstream infection risk associated with midline catheters versus PICCsand versus CVCs, respectively. Randomized controlled trials comparing the risk of bloodstream infections and other complications associated with these devices are needed.
Use an all-inclusive catheter cart or kit (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) A catheter cart or kit that contains all necessary components for aseptic catheter insertion should be available and easily accessible in all units where CVCs are inserted.
Use ultrasound guidance for catheter insertion (Quality of Evidence: HIGH), Ultrasound-guided internal jugular and femoral vein catheterization reduces the risk of noninfectious complications associated with CVC placementbut the use of ultrasound may lead to a breach in aseptic technique. It is unclear whether ultrasound-guided subclavian vein insertion reduces risk of infectious complications.
Use maximum sterile barrier precautions during CVC insertion (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) – Use maximum sterile barrier precautions: A mask, cap, sterile gown, and sterile gloves are to be worn by all HCP involved in the catheter insertion procedure. The patient is to be covered with a large ("full-body") sterile drape during catheter insertion. These measures should also be followed when exchanging a catheter over a guidewire. A prospective, randomized study in surgical patients showed no additional benefit for maximum sterile barrier precautions; nevertheless, most available evidence suggests risk reduction with this intervention.
Use an alcoholic chlorhexidine antiseptic for skin preparation (Quality of Evidence: HIGH),– Before catheter insertion, apply an alcoholic chlorhexidine solution containing at least 2% chlorhexidine gluconate to the insertion site. The antiseptic solution must be allowed to dry before making the skin puncture. Alcoholic chlorhexidine for skin antisepsis to prevent CLABSI in NICU patients should be used when the benefits are judged to outweigh potential risk.

### Practice guidelines for central venous access 2020: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on central venous access [^c99d9b40]. Anesthesiology (2020). High credibility.

Needle insertion, wire placement, and catheter placement — practice elements include selection of catheter size and type, choosing a wire-through-thin-wall needle technique (Seldinger) versus a catheter-over-the-needle–then–wire-through-the-catheter technique (modified Seldinger), limiting insertion attempts, and introducing two catheters in the same central vein; case reports describe severe injury when unintentional arterial cannulation occurs with large-bore catheters, randomized and observational studies show equivocal first-attempt success and complications for right internal jugular comparisons, greater first-attempt success and fewer complications with a thin-wall needle for right-sided subclavian insertion in adults, increased complications with more insertion attempts, and higher frequency of dysrhythmia when two central venous catheters are placed in the same vein compared with one; consultants and ASA members strongly agree with the recommendation to select catheter size and type based on the clinical situation and operator skill/experience, and agree with recommendations to select the smallest appropriate size, to select a thin-wall needle technique versus a catheter-over-the-needle technique for the subclavian approach, and to select either technique for jugular or femoral approaches based on the clinical situation.

Recommendations for prevention of mechanical trauma or injury — Determine catheter insertion site selection based on clinical need and practitioner judgment, experience, and skill, and select an upper body insertion site when possible to minimize the risk of thrombotic complications relative to the femoral site. Perform central venous access in the neck or chest with the patient in the Trendelenburg position when clinically appropriate and feasible. Select catheter size (i.e., outside diameter) and type based on the clinical situation and skill/experience of the operator, select the smallest size catheter appropriate for the clinical situation, and for the subclavian approach select a thin-wall needle (i.e. Seldinger) technique versus a catheter-over-the-needle (i.e., modified Seldinger) technique. For the jugular or femoral approach, select a thin-wall needle or catheter-over-the-needle technique based on the clinical situation and the skill/experience of the operator, and for accessing the vein before threading a dilator or large-bore catheter, base the decision to use a thin-wall needle technique or a catheter-over-the-needle technique at least in part on the method used to confirm that the wire resides in the vein. The number of insertion attempts should be based on clinical judgment, the decision to place two catheters in a single vein should be made on a case-by-case basis, and the catheter-over-the-needle technique may provide more stable venous access if manometry is used for venous confirmation.

### A randomized clinical trial of ultrasound-guided infra-clavicular cannulation of the subclavian vein in cardiac surgical patients: short-axis versus long-axis approach [^4bab4ea3]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to compare the success rate and safety of short-axis versus long-axis approaches to ultrasound-guided subclavian vein cannulation.

Methods

A total of 190 patients requiring central venous cannulation following cardiac surgery were randomized to either short-axis or long-axis ultrasound-guided cannulation of the subclavian vein. Each cannulation was performed by anesthesiologists with at least 3 years' experience of ultrasound-guided central vein cannulation (> 150 procedures/year, 50% short-axis and 50% long-axis). Success rate, insertion time, number of needle redirections, number of separate skin or vessel punctures, rate of mechanical complications, catheter misplacements, and incidence of central line-associated bloodstream infection were documented for each procedure.

Results

The subclavian vein was successfully cannulated in all 190 patients. The mean insertion time was significantly shorter (p = 0.040) in the short-axis group (69 ± 74 s) than in the long-axis group (98 ± 103 s). The short-axis group was also associated with a higher overall success rate (96 vs. 78%, p < 0.001), first-puncture success rate (86 vs. 67%, p = 0.003), and first-puncture single-pass success rate (72 vs. 48%, p = 0.002), and with fewer needle redirections (0.39 ± 0.88 vs. 0.88 ± 1.15, p = 0.001), skin punctures (1.12 ± 0.38 vs. 1.28 ± 0.54, p = 0.019), and complications (3 vs. 13%, p = 0.028).

Conclusions

The short-axis procedure for ultrasound-guided subclavian cannulation offers advantages over the long-axis approach in cardiac surgery patients.

### The influence of the direction of J-tip on the placement of a subclavian catheter: real time ultrasound-guided cannulation versus landmark method, a randomized controlled trial [^0cf95cf4]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

It has been reported that the direction of the guidewire J-tip is associated with misplacement of a central venous catheter. We hypothesized that real-time ultrasound-guided infraclavicular subclavian venous cannulation would be less influenced by the direction of guidewire J-tip compared to landmark method.

Methods

Sixty adult patients who required subclavian venous catheterization for neurosurgery were enrolled in this prospective randomized controlled study. Patients were randomly divided into a landmark group (n = 30) or an ultrasound group (n = 30). After the subclavian vein was punctured, the guidewire was advanced with the guidewire J-tip directed cephalad. Misplacement or advancement failure of the guidewire was regarded as an unsuccessful placement. Postoperative chest radiography was performed to confirm pneumothorax and the location of the catheter tip.

Results

The two groups were comparable with respect to age, gender, height, and weight distribution. The incidence of unsuccessful guidewire placement was lower in the ultrasound group than in the landmark group (13% vs. 47%, P = 0.01). Among the unsuccessful guidewire placements, the incidence of misplacement were comparable between the groups and were all located in the ipsilateral internal jugular vein (7% vs. 7%). However, the incidence of advancement failure was significantly higher in landmark group (40% vs. 7%, P = 0.005). There were no complications such as pneumothorax or hemothorax.

Conclusions

The proper placement of guidewire was less influenced by the direction of the guidewire J-tip with ultrasound-guided subclavian venous cannulation than with the landmark approach.

### Practice guidelines for central venous access 2020: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on central venous access [^2a2232c0]. Anesthesiology (2020). High credibility.

Needle insertion, wire placement, and catheter placement are directed as follows: Select catheter size (i.e., outside diameter) and type based on the clinical situation and skill/experience of the operator. Select the smallest size catheter appropriate for the clinical situation. For the subclavian approach select a thin-wall needle (i.e. Seldinger) technique versus a catheter-over-the-needle (i.e., modified Seldinger) technique. For the jugular or femoral approach, select a thin-wall needle or catheter-over-the-needle technique based on the clinical situation and the skill/experience of the operator. For accessing the vein before threading a dilator or large-bore catheter, base the decision to use a thin-wall needle technique or a catheter-over-the-needle technique at least in part on the method used to confirm that the wire resides in the vein. The number of insertion attempts should be based on clinical judgment. The decision to place two catheters in a single vein should be made on a case-by-case basis. The catheter over-the-needle technique may provide more stable venous access if manometry is used for venous confirmation.

### The never-ending confusion between subclavian vein and axillary vein [^01500823]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2025). Medium credibility.

The use of precise and unequivocal terminology is crucial in clinical and scientific communication. A frequent source of error involves the anatomical confusion between the axillary vein and the subclavian vein. Anatomically, the transition from the axillary vein to the subclavian vein occurs at the lateral border of the first rib, beneath the clavicle. Consequently, the vessel typically visualized by ultrasound in the infraclavicular region is the axillary vein, not the subclavian vein. Nevertheless, numerous international guidelines and clinical studies continue to misidentify the thoracic segment of the axillary vein as the "subclavian vein". This persistent mislabeling hinders the international standardization of ultrasound-guided procedures, complicates the comparison of various techniques, and-most importantly-risks misinterpretation of evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice.

Noncuffed double-lumen catheters — procedural safety and discharge: Ultrasound-directed cannulation of NCCs minimizes insertion complications and should be used when available; because most NCCs are placed at the bedside, a postinsertion chest radiograph after internal jugular or subclavian insertion is mandatory to confirm the position of the catheter tip in the SVC and exclude complications; the Work Group indicates that a patient with an NCC should not be discharged, and a short-term catheter can be converted to a TCC if there is no evidence of active infection.

### Guidelines for performing ultrasound guided vascular cannulation: recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography and the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists [^817639e1]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2011). Medium credibility.

Subclavian (SC) vein cannulation — ultrasound-guided technique and comparative outcomes are described, noting that the supraclavicular approach (without ultrasound) has largely been abandoned because of a high incidence of pneumothorax. For positioning, there is less vessel distention of the SC vein than the IJ vein and thus the primary reason for the Trendelenburg position is to reduce the risk for air embolism in spontaneously breathing patients. During landmark insertion, the needle should enter at a very low (nearly parallel) angle to the chest wall because an increased or steeper angle increases the likelihood of creating a pneumothorax, and chest radiography is mandatory not only to confirm proper line placement but also to rule out pneumothorax. For ultrasound-guided cannulation, the use of a smaller footprint transducer probe for SC vein access for real-time ultrasound imaging is recommended; similar to the landmark technique, the middle third of the clavicle is chosen and the transducer is oriented to image the SC vein in the SAX view with a coronal imaging plane. Venous confirmation can be facilitated by injection of agitated saline "echo contrast", and confirmation can also be achieved by addition of color flow Doppler; when the transducer marker is toward the left shoulder during right SC cannulation, arterial flow indicates flow away from the transducer while venous flow indicates flow toward the transducer. A prospective randomized study favored ultrasound-guided over landmark-guided SC cannulation with a higher success rate (92% vs 44%), fewer minor complications (1 vs 11), and fewer venopunctures (1.4 vs 2.5) and catheter kits (1.0 vs 1.4) per attempted cannulation; in a more recent series of 1,250 attempted central venous catheter placements that included 354 SC attempts, the benefit of ultrasound for SC cannulation was less than for the IJ vein, yet success rates were high with ultrasound guidance even when surface techniques were unsuccessful.

### Major immediate insertion-related complications after central venous catheterisation and associations with mortality, length of hospital stay, and costs: a prospective observational study [^0fe352c4]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2025). Medium credibility.

Available studies have been unable to find associations between immediate insertion-related complications after CVC insertion and mortality. Compared to those studies, the present study had greater power, investigated longer term mortality (up to 180 days after CVC insertion) and also corrected for patient morbidity. None of the major immediate insertion-related complications in the present study were deemed directly responsible for any deaths. Nevertheless, a strong association with mortality was demonstrated. The reason for this is not explained by this study, but one hypothesis is that major immediate insertion-related complications can delay treatment or require invasive interventions, which in turn could affect mortality.

As demonstrated in Figure 2, the OR for 30-day mortality was unchanged when independent variables were added stepwise. The second set of sensitivity analyses, in which 'major immediate insertion-related complications' were changed to 'any immediate insertion-related complication', also confirmed the association with mortality. These findings indicate that the results in the present study are robust.

This study has several limitations. First, the study relies on a strong tradition to document every CVC insertion in the medical records, but still some insertions may remain undocumented. Second, we aimed to investigate clinical practice in an ultrasound-guided era. Ultrasound guidance was not used in 3% of the cases, but when those were excluded in sensitivity analyses, the results remained very similar. Third, we lack data regarding the exact puncture site for CVCs inserted in the subclavian/axillary veins. Fourth, due to unavailable economic data for patients admitted to non-university clinics, only patients admitted to a university hospital were included. Fifth, although the independent variables were selected very carefully, unmeasured confounders may remain. Sixth, although the missing indicator method was used and found valid, missing values may still have affected the results. Seventh, only the costs immediately relevant to the hospital stay were included in this study. Other costs to the individual, their family, society and wider health-care systems such as later prescriptions and follow up visits, were not considered. Eighth, there were few patients with major immediate insertion-related complications, yielding a less precise result with wide confidence intervals and a risk of a limited goodness of fit. However, when power was increased in the sensitivity analyses, the association with mortality remained.

trial was concealed in that the site of insertion was given by telephone to the investigators from the central randomization center. All caregivers and other research personnel were blinded to the randomization schedule and the block size. A 15- or 16-cm-long polyurethane standard central venous catheter was inserted into the designated site by a staff physician or supervised resident physician. Physicians were allowed to switch from one side to the other if the first attempt was unsuccessful. Maximal sterile-barrier precautions were taken, including use of large sterile drapes, surgical antiseptic hand wash. Mechanical Complications. Catheter-related mechanical complications were assessed in 289 patients, including patients with unsuccessful catheter insertion. Mechanical complications occurred in 25 of the 145 patients with femoral catheterization and 27 of the 144 patients with subclavian catheterization.

Complications were predominantly arterial puncture. randomized. Among the 19 patients with no catheter tip culture, 7 catheters could not be inserted, 4 were grossly contaminated during removal, and 8 were removed without notification of the investigator. Catheters were removed because of suspicion of catheter-related sepsis in 31 patients in the femoral group and 37 patients in the subclavian. and the examination was refused or not done in 15 patients. Catheter-related thromboses were detected in 25 patients who received a femoral catheter and in 2 who received a subclavian catheter. Four cases of fibrin sleeves. Central venous catheter–related complications in critically ill patients are usually classified as mechanical, infectious, and thrombotic. In our study, the 4 major mechanical complications observed with the subclavian approach were pneumothoraces necessitating chest tube insertion with uncomplicated course. This rate is similar to those previously reported. 3, 4 Although it is clear that subclavian. has been shown for the subclavian approach. 21 Analysis of the factors associated with catheter-related mechanical complications identified 3 independent risk factors: the time needed for catheter insertion, a variable similar to the number of needle passes previously reported as a risk factor3; insertion during the night.

the subclavian vein. 2 The potential problems and complications associated with attempted subclavian vein catheterization include failure to locate and successfully cannulate the vein, catheter malposition, pneumothorax, mediastinal hematoma, subclavian artery puncture, hemothorax, and brachial plexus or other nerve injury. 2 These complications may increase patient morbidity, prolong hospitalization, or delay therapy. The most common complication is failure to cannulate the subclavian vein. A variety of positional techniques are available that may increase the rate of successful cannulation; however, a method of subclavian vein cannulation that guarantees success has yet to be identified. 5, 6 Surface and Doppler ultrasonography have been recommended to determine the exact location of the subclavian vein and artery and guide the physician in placement of a central venous catheter.

After 4 unsuccessful attempts, a chest radiograph was obtained to evaluate for complications and the patient was declared a failure of subclavian vein cannulation. Attempt at subclavian vein catheterization using the initial technique failed in 59 patients. The failure rate was independent of body mass index, prior irradiation, prior surgery, prior catheterization, or prior attempt at catheterization. Fifty-five of these patients underwent crossover to the other technique; 4 patients refused further attempts at subclavian vein catheterization. Smart Needle subclavian catheter insertion was successful in 18 of 21 patients crossed over to this technique after the standard technique failed, for a secondary success rate of 86%.

This was slightly higher than but not statistically different from the 79% success rate for the standard technique. No clinical parameter was a significant predictor of failure on the initial attempt or secondary attempt. Previous central venous catheters, previous attempts at an ipsilateral subclavian catheter, abnormal body mass index, and surgery or radiotherapy in the region adjacent to the site of cannulation may decrease the likelihood of successful catheter insertion. 2 In our study, no clinical parameter was identified that was associated with a higher rate of success using the Smart Needle.

Catheters and port catheter systems — site selection and imaging: The preferred insertion site for tunneled cuffed venous dialysis catheters or port catheter systems is the right internal jugular vein, with subclavian access used only when no other upper-extremity or chest-wall options are available (A). Other options include the right external jugular vein, left internal and external jugular veins, subclavian veins, femoral veins, and translumbar and transhepatic access to the IVC, and ultrasound should be used in the placement of catheters (B); the position of the tip of any central catheter should be verified radiologically (B).

### Standards for nutrition support: adult hospitalized patients [^89a76b74]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2010). Medium credibility.

Standard 12. Nutrition support access — Access for nutrition support therapy shall be achieved and maintained in a manner that minimizes risk to the patient. Standard techniques and policies should be established and followed for access device insertion and routine care. The selection of a venous access site (central vs peripheral vein) should depend on expected duration of therapy, nutrition requirements, and patient's vascular condition, and the subclavian site (rather than a jugular or femoral site) should be used in adult patients to minimize infection risks for nontunneled central venous catheters for PN delivery. The selection of an enteral access device (nasogastric vs enterostomy, ie, gastrostomy or jejunostomy) should depend on the patient's disease state, gastrointestinal anatomy and function, expected duration of nutrition support therapy, and the ability to safely access the gastrointestinal tract via radiologic, surgical, or endoscopic techniques. Appropriate access devices shall be placed by a physician, nurse, or trained healthcare professional who is competent to place the specific access device, and professionals with knowledge in recognizing and managing complications associated with the placement and maintenance of the access devices should maintain the use of the access devices. Proper placement of central venous and enteral access devices shall be radiographically confirmed and documented in the medical record before initial use, and for enteral access devices, the auscultatory method should not be relied upon to differentiate between pulmonary, gastric, and small bowel placement of a nasoenteric tube. Central venous access should be used for the delivery of parenteral nutrition formulations with an osmolarity > 900 mOsm/L, the catheter tip should be positioned in the distal superior vena cava adjacent to the caval-atrial junction, and peripheral PN may be given, if indicated, through a peripheral access device, provided the osmolarity of the formulation is ≤ 900 mOsm/L.

### Practice guidelines for central venous access 2020: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on central venous access [^3ab4ee5b]. Anesthesiology (2020). High credibility.

Central venous access — ultrasound guidance for needle, wire, and catheter placement includes real-time or dynamic ultrasound for vessel localization and guiding the needle and static ultrasound imaging for prepuncture vessel localization, with evidence favoring ultrasound over anatomical landmarks for internal jugular access and mixed findings for other sites; consultants and ASA members express graded agreement on when real-time and static ultrasound should be used. Guidance for needle, wire, and catheter placement includes (1) real-time or dynamic ultrasound for vessel localization and guiding the needle to its intended venous location and (2) static ultrasound imaging for the purpose of prepuncture vessel localization. Meta-analyses of RCTs comparing real-time ultrasound-guided venipuncture of the internal jugular with an anatomical landmark approach report higher first insertion attempt success rates, higher overall success rates, lower rates of arterial puncture, and fewer insertion attempts (Category A1-B evidence), and RCTs also indicate reduced access time or times to cannulation with ultrasound compared with a landmark approach (Category A2-B evidence). For the subclavian vein, RCTs report fewer insertion attempts and higher overall success rates with real-time ultrasound-guided venipuncture (Category A2-B evidence), while findings are equivocal for arterial puncture and hematoma (Category A2-E evidence). For the femoral vein in pediatric patients, an RCT reports a higher first-attempt success rate and fewer needle passes with real-time ultrasound-guided venipuncture compared with the landmark approach (Category A3-B evidence). For static ultrasound versus landmark, meta-analyses yield equivocal evidence for improved overall success rates for internal jugular insertion, overall success irrespective of insertion site, and impact on arterial puncture rates (Category A1-E evidence), though RCTs report a higher first insertion attempt success rate for locating the internal jugular vein with static ultrasound (Category A3-B evidence), and the literature is equivocal for subclavian or femoral access (Category A3-E evidence). The consultants and ASA members strongly agree with the recommendation to use real-time ultrasound guidance when the internal jugular vein is selected for cannulation and agree that feasible, real-time ultrasound may be used when the subclavian or femoral vein is selected; they strongly agree and agree, respectively, with using static ultrasound imaging before prepping and draping for prepuncture identification of anatomy to determine vessel localization and patency when the internal jugular vein is selected, and agree that static ultrasound may also be used when the subclavian or femoral vein is selected.

### Guidelines for the appropriate use of bedside general and cardiac ultrasonography in the evaluation of critically ill patients-part I: general ultrasonography [^6e6dac98]. Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Subclavian/axillary venous cannulation — We suggest that ultrasound dynamic guidance is of limited value for most operators to guide subclavian vein catheterization in adult patients (and that landmark technique is used instead) (Grade 2C). Evidence includes a randomized comparison of static ultrasound versus landmark with no difference in complications (9.7% vs 9.8%) or cannulation failure (12.4% vs 12.4%); for inexperienced operators, real-time ultrasound improved overall success and complications and reduced attempts (92% vs 44%; p = 0.0036; 4% vs 41%; 1.4 vs 2.5; p = 0.0007), while among experienced operators an RCT showed 100% versus 87% success but with a baseline complication rate of 16%, and the guideline states, "For this reason, we have graded our recommendation as 2C".

### Ultrasound-guided central venous catheter placement: a structured review and recommendations for clinical practice [^6beebc29]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale for ultrasound-guided central venous catheter placement

Traditionally, CVC placement is performed using landmark techniques based on the knowledge of anatomic structures and palpation of arteries next to the veins. These landmark techniques cannot account for anatomic variations at the CVC insertion site. Anatomic variations to the "normal anatomy", however, have been described in a relevant proportion of patients for the internal jugular vein (IJV), the subclavian vein (SV), and the femoral vein (FV). In addition to anatomic variations, venous thrombosis that is especially common in oncologic and critically ill patients can make CVC placement impossible or dangerous for the patient.

The described anatomic variations and the presence of venous thrombosis can hardly be identified using a landmark technique. In contrast, US can be used to easily visualize anatomic structures and confirm patency of the vein and thus help to avoid unintended arterial puncture or unsuccessful cannulation. In addition, US can facilitate CVC placement in special clinical situations in which landmark techniques based on palpation of the arterial pulse are challenging or impossible (e.g. femoral CVC placement during cardiopulmonary resuscitation or in patients with a nonpulsatile ventricular assist device).

Tunneled cuffed venous catheter placement — use sites and avoidance include placing in an area where ultrasound guidance and fluoroscopy are available, preferring the right internal jugular vein, which offers a more direct route to the right atrium and is associated with a lower risk of complications and fewer placement complications than other sites, avoiding the left internal jugular when possible given poorer BFRs and greater rates of stenosis and thrombosis, recognizing that femoral and translumbar vein placement are associated with the greatest infection rates compared with other sites, not placing catheters in the subclavian vessels on either side because of the risk for stenosis that can permanently exclude upper-extremity permanent fistula or graft, not placing catheters on the same side as a slowly maturing permanent access, and noting catheter-induced central vein stenosis is related to site of insertion, number and duration of catheter uses, and occurrence of infection.

### Efficacy of an implementation package on documentation of central venous catheter insertions: an observational study [^1276da0a]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Background

Proper documentation of central venous catheter (CVC) insertions in electronic healthcare records is the basis for good follow-up and quality assurance. We have noted serious deficiencies in the documentation of CVC insertions and introduced an implementation package with the purpose of increasing the completeness of this documentation. The aim of the present study was to estimate the effect of the implementation package by assessing the proportion of missing data before and after the introduction of the implementation package.

Methods

In this single centre observational study, data from CVC insertion templates in a common electronic health record were extracted and analysed after introducing the implementation package. The package included adoption of new local CVC-directions, a new updated CVC-insertion template in the regional common electronic health record and a review of all CVC-insertion templates with a reminder to the inserting physician to supplement missing data. The proportion of terms with missing data was reviewed and also compared with the proportion of missing data in a study prior to the introduction of the package.

Results

In total, 7126 CVC-insertion templates were included. Of these 5539 (78%) were without missing data for any of the 13 predefined variables. Completed insertion templates for three common terms increased from 38% prior to the introduction of the implementation package to 93%, which represents an absolute reduction for missing data of 55% (95% CI 53% to 56%, p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

The implementation package was highly effective in increasing the proportion of fully documented CVC insertions.

### Influence of shoulder position on central venous catheter tip location during infraclavicular subclavian approach [^da820b93]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Infraclavicular approach of the subclavian veins is commonly used for central venous access. However, aberrant catheter tip locations are frequently quoted for this approach. It was hypothesized that with the shoulder pulled downwards, the angle between the internal jugular and subclavian veins may increase, directing subclavian catheters into the internal jugular vein. This prospective study assessed the influence of the shoulder position on proper placement of right infraclavicular subclavian catheters.

Methods

Patients who required subclavian central venous catheterization for major neurosurgical and thoracic procedures were randomly divided into two groups: neutral (n = 180) vs lowered (n = 181) shoulder position. The right shoulder was placed and maintained in the neutral or lowered position during venipuncture and guidewire insertion. Postoperative chest radiographs were obtained to identify the location of catheter tips.

Results

There were no differences in gender, age, body weight, and height between the two groups. There were five failures in the neutral position [5/180 (2.8%)] and eight failures in the lowered shoulder position [8/181 (4.0%)] (P = NS). The occurrence of immediate complications such as pneumothorax or arterial puncture was not different. Aberrant placement of the catheter tips was more frequent in the lowered shoulder position [2/173 (1.2%) vs 14/173 (8.1%)] (P < 0.01).

Conclusions

The neutral shoulder position minimizes the number of needle passes and the incidence of catheter misplacement during the infraclavicular approach of the right subclavian vein catheterization.

### A descriptive comparison of ultrasound-guided central venous cannulation of the internal jugular vein to landmark-based subclavian vein cannulation [^126798f3]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

The safest site for central venous cannulation (CVC) remains debated. Many emergency physicians (EPs) advocate the ultrasound-guided internal jugular (USIJ) approach because of data supporting its efficiency. However, a number of physicians prefer, and are most comfortable with, the subclavian (SC) vein approach. The purpose of this study was to describe adverse event rates among operators using the USIJ approach, and the landmark SC vein approach without US.

Methods

This was a prospective observational trial of patients undergoing CVC of the SC or internal jugular veins in the emergency department (ED). Physicians performing the procedures did not undergo standardized training in either technique. The primary outcome was a composite of adverse events defined as hematoma, arterial cannulation, pneumothorax, and failure to cannulate. Physicians recorded the anatomical site of cannulation, US assistance, indications, and acute complications. Variables of interest were collected from the pharmacy and ED record. Physician experience was based on a self-reported survey. The authors followed outcomes of central line insertion until device removal or patient discharge.

Results

Physicians attempted 236 USIJ and 132 SC cannulations on 333 patients. The overall adverse event rate was 22% with failure to cannulate being the most common. Adverse events occurred in 19% of USIJ attempts, compared to 29% of non-US-guided SC attempts. Among highly experienced operators, CVCs placed at the SC site resulted in more adverse events than those performed using USIJ (relative risk [RR] = 1.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05 to 3.39).

Conclusions

While limited by observational design, our results suggest that the USIJ technique may result in fewer adverse events compared to the landmark SC approach.

### Ultrasound guidance versus anatomical landmarks for subclavian or femoral vein catheterization [^3074d8f4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Central venous catheters can help with diagnosis and treatment of the critically ill. The catheter may be placed in a large vein in the neck (internal jugular vein), upper chest (subclavian vein) or groin (femoral vein). Whilst this is beneficial overall, inserting the catheter risks arterial puncture and other complications and should be performed in as few attempts as possible. In the past, anatomical 'landmarks' on the body surface were used to find the correct place to insert these catheters, but ultrasound imaging is now available. A Doppler mode is sometimes used to supplement plain 'two-dimensional' ultrasound.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of two-dimensional ultrasound (US)- or Doppler ultrasound (USD)-guided puncture techniques for subclavian vein, axillary vein and femoral vein puncture during central venous catheter insertion in adults and children. We assessed whether there was a difference in complication rates between traditional landmark-guided and any ultrasound-guided central vein puncture. When possible, we also assessed the following secondary objectives: whether a possible difference could be verified with use of the US technique versus the USD technique; whether there was a difference between using ultrasound throughout the puncture ('direct') and using it only to identify and mark the vein before starting the puncture procedure ('indirect'); and whether these possible differences might be evident in different groups of patients or with different levels of experience among those inserting the catheters.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to 15 January 2013), EMBASE (1966 to 15 January 2013), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to 15 January 2013), reference lists of articles, 'grey literature' and dissertations. An additional handsearch focused on intensive care and anaesthesia journals and abstracts and proceedings of scientific meetings. We attempted to identify unpublished or ongoing studies by contacting companies and experts in the field, and we searched trial registers. We reran the search in August 2014. We will deal with any studies of interest when we update the review.

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing two-dimensional ultrasound or Doppler ultrasound versus an anatomical 'landmark' technique during insertion of subclavian or femoral venous catheters in both adults and children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently extracted data on methodological quality, participants, interventions and outcomes of interest using a standardized form. We performed a priori subgroup analyses.

Main Results

Altogether 13 studies enrolling 2341 participants (and involving 2360 procedures) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The quality of evidence was very low (subclavian vein N = 3) or low (subclavian vein N = 4, femoral vein N = 2) for most outcomes, moderate for one outcome (femoral vein) and high at best for two outcomes (subclavian vein N = 1, femoral vein N = 1). Most of the trials had unclear risk of bias across the six domains, and heterogeneity among the studies was significant. For the subclavian vein (nine studies, 2030 participants, 2049 procedures), two-dimensional ultrasound reduced the risk of inadvertent arterial puncture (three trials, 498 participants, risk ratio (RR) 0.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.82; P value 0.02, I² = 0%) and haematoma formation (three trials, 498 participants, RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.76; P value 0.01, I² = 0%). No evidence was found of a difference in total or other complications (together, US, USD), overall (together, US, USD), number of attempts until success (US) or first-time (US) success rates or time taken to insert the catheter (US). For the femoral vein, fewer data were available for analysis (four studies, 311 participants, 311 procedures). No evidence was found of a difference in inadvertent arterial puncture or other complications. However, success on the first attempt was more likely with ultrasound (three trials, 224 participants, RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.22; P value < 0.0001, I² = 31%), and a small increase in the overall success rate was noted (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.23; P value 0.06, I² = 50%). No data on mortality or participant-reported outcomes were provided.

Authors' Conclusions

On the basis of available data, we conclude that two-dimensional ultrasound offers small gains in safety and quality when compared with an anatomical landmark technique for subclavian (arterial puncture, haematoma formation) or femoral vein (success on the first attempt) cannulation for central vein catheterization. Data on insertion by inexperienced or experienced users, or on patients at high risk for complications, are lacking. The results for Doppler ultrasound techniques versus anatomical landmark techniques are uncertain.

### The influence of the direction of J-tip on the placement of a subclavian catheter: real time ultrasound-guided cannulation versus landmark method, a randomized controlled trial [^52ca06eb]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

The head or shoulder position appears to be important for the central venous catheter direction during the infraclavicular subclavian approach. Turning the head away from the needle puncture site increases the angle of the SCV and IJV, and causes malpositioning in the IJV. Lowering the shoulder position reduces the angle between the SCV and innominate vein, and increases the incidence of catheter misplacement into the ipsilateral IJV. In the present study, subclavian venous cannulation was performed with the head and shoulders in a neutral position to exclude any positional effect.

In this study, the incidence of failure to thread the guidewire was high. Failure to thread the guidewire can occur when the J-tip is directed cephalad. If the guidewire met any stiff resistance while advancing into the SCV, we did not advance the guidewire. If we had advanced the guidewire despite the resistance we could have advanced into the IJV more frequently.

### Which is the easiest and safest technique for central venous access? A retrospective survey of more than 5, 400 cases [^3223ddd4]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2007). Low credibility.

There is an ongoing debate on the technique for central venous catheterization associated with the lowest complication rate and the highest success rate. In an attempt to better define the easiest and safest venous approach, we have reviewed our 7-year experience with 5479 central venous percutaneous punctures (by Seldinger's technique) for the insertion of short-term (n = 2109), medium/long-term (n = 2627) catheters, as well as double-lumen, large-bore catheters for hemodialysis and/or hemapheresis (n = 743). We have analyzed the incidence of the most frequent in-sertion-related complications by comparing seven different venous approaches: jugular vein, low lateral approach; jugular vein, high lateral approach; jugular vein, low axial approach; subclavian vein, infraclavicular approach; subclavian vein, supraclavicular approach; external jugular vein; femoral vein. The results of our retrospective study suggest that the 'low lateral' approach to the internal jugular vein, as described by Jernigan and modified according to our protocol, appears to be the easiest and safest technique for percutaneous insertion of central venous access, being characterized by the lowest incidence of accidental arte-rial puncture (1.2%) and malposition (0.8%), no pneumothorax, and an extremely low rate of repeated attempts (i.e. more than two punctures before successful cannulation) (3.3%). We advocate the 'low lateral' approach to the internal jugular vein as first-choice technique for venipuncture in both adults and children, for both short-term and long-term central venous percutaneous cannulation.

### Effects of ipsilateral tilt position on the cross-sectional area of the subclavian vein and the clinical performance of subclavian vein catheterization: a prospective randomized trial [^687b794b]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

For last decades, the use of ultrasonography during vascular procedures has been suggested as a standard method that enhances overall success and reduces procedure-related complications, by professional organizations. Ultrasonographic assessment can be applied before, during, and after central venous cannulation, and provides clinicians with advantages of success, speed, and safety, by visualizing vessel viability, size, and patency, as well as the location of other adjacent anatomically important structures. With respect to ultrasound-guided subclavian vein catheterization, although the quality of evidence is generally weak, the use of ultrasound-guidance is recommended in adult patients. The results of the present study also provide supplemental evidence for the current guidelines. Especially, the primary venipuncture success rate was relatively low in this study. This can be overcome by the use of ultrasonography during catheterization. Previous studies demonstrated a significant increase in the first-pass success rate of subclavian vein catheterization and decrease in insertion attempts needed for venipuncture when ultrasound was used than landmark approach.

Limitations

This study had several limitations. First, there was a little anatomical discrepancy between the site which the csSCV was measured in stage I and the site which the actual venous puncture was achieved in stage II. Second, the operator performing catheterization could not be completely blinded to the position of the patients; this may have influenced the results. Third, although the operators had considerable experience with subclavian vein catheterization, they were more familiar with catheterization in patients placed in the supine position. This bias may have also influenced the overall success rate. Fourth, all catheterization was performed by two experienced practitioners. Therefore, our results may not be extrapolated to those with little experience. Fifth, subclavian vein catheterization was performed using the landmark technique. Therefore, it is hard to generalize our findings to ultrasound-guided catheterization, which is widely used during central venous catheterization. In addition, patients where there was a difficulty in locating the surface anatomical landmarks, such as morbid obesity, trauma, and chest wall deformity, were excluded from this study. The use of ultrasonography is also helpful for successful subclavian vein catheterization in such patients. Finally, this study was conducted in euvolemic patients. Therefore, this study does not clarify how enlargement of the vein in abnormal situations (i.e. hypovolemia) would affect successful catheter placement. Further studies are required to evaluate these relationships.

### AIUM practice parameter for the use of ultrasound to guide vascular access procedures [^ed08f636]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization — preprocedure scanning, site considerations, and device–vessel sizing. It is estimated that approximately 5 million central venous catheters are inserted annually in the United States. There are 4 major sites for accomplishing central venous catheter access — internal jugular (IJ), subclavian, axillary, and femoral veins; while ultrasound may guide all 4 sites, the subclavian vein may be more challenging to visualize due to interference from the clavicle, and access via the axillary vein or a supraclavicular approach may be more amenable to ultrasound. A preprocedure scan should be performed before sterile precautions are secured to identify thrombi, occlusion, and unfavorable anatomy, and measurement of vessel diameter should be assessed before catheter placement to accommodate the catheter. Current standards recommend a catheter-to-vein ratio of 45% or less for the placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) as a strategy to reduce the risk of deep venous thrombosis.

### Strategies to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^6c3b7443]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Essential practices — The subclavian vein is considered the preferable site for central venous catheter (CVC) insertion in the intensive care setting to reduce infectious complications, replacing the prior emphasis on avoiding the femoral vein while affirming that guidance remains valid. The recommendation to use ultrasound guidance for catheter insertion is backed by better evidence than was available previously; however, the procedure itself may jeopardize the strict observation of sterile technique. The use of chlorhexidine-containing dressings is now considered an "essential practice"; in the past, it was listed under special approaches that should only be employed if CLABSI rates remain high despite the implementation of basic practices.

### Longing for better ultrasound-guided subclavian / axillary venous cannulation [^4e653b81]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Ultrasound guidance for central venous catheter (CVC) placement reduces complications, increases safety and enhances the quality of the procedure. Existing guidelines suggest a higher level of evidence for ultrasound-guided internal jugular venous cannulation compared with the subclavian/axillary route. Meta-analysis of trials studying the use of ultrasound guidance for subclavian venous cannulation, when compared with the landmark technique, showed decreased incidence of arterial puncture and hematoma formation, but there was no overall difference in complications and success rates.

Smaller studies have shown that patient positioning during cannulation of the subclavian vein (e.g. turning the head to the contralateral side, shoulder-pulled-downward position, and abducted position of arm) can alter the relationship between the subclavian vein and the internal jugular vein and can also alter the cross-sectional area of the vein, thus potentially affecting the safety and success of cannulation. Further well designed studies should try to explore the influence of these various patient positions on ultrasound-guided subclavian venous cannulation.

### Real-time ultrasound-guided supraclavicular technique as a possible alternative approach for hickman catheter implantation [^3b2f6a34]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Tunneled Hickman/Broviac central venous catheter implantation is performed when patients require a central vein route for long-term therapy. The subclavian or internal jugular vein approach is often chosen for their implantation sites. However, access to the central vein can be difficult owing to thrombosis or stenosis when the same vein has already been accessed several times. In such situations, other possible alternative approaches to the central vein should be considered to avoid serious complications owing to further unsuccessful attempts.

Description Of Operative Technique

We encountered a 1-year-old patient admitted to our hospital for a Hickman catheter implantation after multiple unsuccessful attempts at central venous catheter insertion via bilateral subclavian approaches in another hospital. An ultrasound showed that no more subclavian veins were available on either side. A real-time ultrasound-guided right supraclavicular approach was performed as a solution to this situation.

Conclusions

In this article, we introduce a real-time ultrasound-guided supraclavicular approach as a possible alternative method for Hickman catheter implantation. We present step-by-step instructions including figures and a video and further discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this procedure, comparing the right and left approaches with references to existing literature.

Level Of Evidence

### Real-time ultrasound-guided catheterisation of the internal jugular vein: a prospective comparison with the landmark technique in critical care patients [^ca09ffb8]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

It is of note that the most favourable outcomes associated with real-time ultrasound guidance as compared with the landmark technique were found in studies of inexperienced observers. We showed the superiority of the ultrasound method in a study in which all observers had comparable experience in CVC placement. The patients who underwent the ultrasound-guided cannulation and those who underwent the landmark-guided cannulation of the IJV were comparable in everything that is pertinent to this procedure, including the presence of risk factors for difficult venous cannulation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such a controlled comparison has been done between the two methods of IJV cannulation. This is important because no other factors should have affected the results and therefore the only determining factor was the technique itself.

The clinical notion that the additional equipment and manipulation associated with the ultrasound method might have increased the rate of catheter-related infection was not confirmed by the present data. We found that the incidence of CVC-BSI in the ultrasound group of patients was significantly lower compared with that documented in the landmark group. The number of CVC-BSIs was significantly correlated to the number of needle passes in the total study population. We could speculate that repeated attempts might lead to a breakdown of aseptic technique and more colonisation of skin-related pathogens. The above findings may be of clinical importance for two reasons. First, it is well documented that CVC-BSI is a common problem in the management of the critical care patient. Second, catheters inserted into the IJV have been associated with higher risk for infection than those inserted into the subclavian or femoral vein. In this study, the incidence of bacterial strains implicated in CVC-BSI was similar in patients of the landmark group as compared with patients of the ultrasound group, except for a significantly higher incidence of coagulase-negative Staphylococci which was documented in the landmark group. A possible explanation for the above observation may be the increased access time and number of average attempts which were documented in the landmark group compared with the ultrasound group. Furthermore, the density of skin flora at the catheter insertion site is a major risk factor for CVC-BSI. Some authors recommend that, to reduce the risk for infection, CVCs be placed in a subclavian site instead of a jugular or femoral site. However, no randomised trial has satisfactorily compared infection rates for catheters placed in jugular, subclavian, and femoral sites.

### Effects of ipsilateral tilt position on the cross-sectional area of the subclavian vein and the clinical performance of subclavian vein catheterization: a prospective randomized trial [^e8908609]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

In this study, there were no significant differences in the incidence of procedure-related mechanical complications in the groups S and I during landmark-based subclavian vein catheterization. The complication rates related to catheterization in both positions were 9.3 and 6.4%, respectively (P = 0.586). In previous studies, the incidence of subclavian vein catheterization-related complications was 5.8–16.8%. Moreover, the development of complications during subclavian vein catheterization has been associated with the number of needling attempts and the number of failed attempts at catheterization. Another study reported a significant association between the duration of catheter insertion and the occurrence of catheterization-related mechanical complications. In our patients, the total catheterization time and the number of venipuncture and failed catheterization attempts did not differ between the patients in the supine versus the ipsilateral tilt position.

According to our results, the number of attempts for dilator insertion was significantly higher in patients in the ipsilateral tilt than the supine position, presumably because the soft tissue of the patients would be shifted ipsilaterally to operator's side by tilting the operating table in patients in the ipsilateral position. The use of excessive force to achieve dilator insertion and repeated attempts to insert the dilator can cause serious vessel injuries. Moreover, although we did not observe any other significant difference in procedure-related variables between the groups, the ipsilateral position might negatively affect the number of needling or guidewire insertion as well. These can raise concerns about procedure-related safety issues related to the ipsilateral position. Therefore, additional caution would be required for patient safety during subclavian vein catheterization in the ipsilateral tilt position.

### Efficacy of an implementation package on documentation of central venous catheter insertions: an observational study [^142aa7a8]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Outcomes

Primary outcome was to assess the number of terms with missing data in the CVC insertion templates during the study period. Secondary outcome was to compare the proportion of terms with missing data with the same measurement in a previous study performed in the same cohort but prior to the introduction of the implementation package. The 13 predefined key variables that were reviewed are listed in table 1.

Patient and public involvement

Patients were not involved in the design of the study. However, the study was performed in the interest of patients receiving a CVC where it is of great importance to document the insertion procedure both in the interest of the specific patient but also for future patients as the insertion templates will be used as the basis for follow-up and quality assurance. Patients were not involved in the recruitment and conduct of the study.

Statistics

If all 13 predefined terms were without missing data, the template was considered complete. The terms with CVC information (bore size/number of lumens, catheter model/LOT and catheter length) was regarded as complete if either model or LOT were recorded. Templates containing bore size/number of lumens and catheter length, but missing model /LOT were regarded as complete if the CVC was inserted at a hospital where only one model with that combination of length and bore size was available.

The ratio of missing terms per CVC insertion template for each individual CVC inserting clinician was calculated and cases with a ratio greater than one was noted. To assess change in documentation of CVC insertions, the proportion of missing data after the introduction of the implementation package was compared with that reported in a previous study describing CVC documentation practices in all patients receiving CVC in the same hospitals between 2013 and 2016. Three common fields were compared ('Vascular insertion site', 'Catheter bore size/number of lumens' and 'Number of punctures through skin'). In the previous study, these three variables were responsible for all of the missing data. The χ² test was used to test for differences between observed frequencies. P values were not adjusted for multiple comparisons since the number of tests was limited.

Computer software used was Microsoft Excel 2013 and MedCalc (Online version, MedCalc Software Ltd, Ostend, Belgium).⁠

### Percutaneous closure of accidentally subclavian artery catheterization: time to change first line approach? [^2f6792ec]. CVIR Endovascular (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To present our experience and provide a literature review dissertation about the use of a suture-mediated percutaneous closure device (Perclose Proglide -PP- Abbott Vascular Inc. Santa Clara, CA, USA) to achieve hemostasis for unintended subclavian arterial catheterization during central venous line placement.

Materials & methods

Since October 2020, we have successfully treated four consecutive patients with a central venous catheter (8 to 12 French) in the subclavian artery. In each patient, we released a PP, monitoring its efficacy by performing a subclavian angiogram and placing, as a rescue strategy, an 8 mm balloon catheter near the entry point of the misplaced catheter. Primary outcome is technical and clinical success. Technical success is defined as absence of bleeding signs at completion angiography, while clinical success is a composite endpoint defined as absence of hematoma, hemoglobin loss at 12 and 24 h, and absence of procedure-related reintervention (due to vessel stenosis, pseudoaneurysm or distal embolization).

Results

Technical success was obtained in 75% of cases. In one patient a mild extravasation was resolved after 3 min of balloon catheter inflation. No early complications were observed for all patients.

Conclusions

PP showed a safe and effective therapeutic option in case of unintentional arterial cannulation. It can be considered as first-line strategy, as it does not preclude the possibility to use other endovascular approaches in case of vascular closure device failure.

We recommend using ultrasound guidance for dialysis catheter insertion (1A) and obtaining a chest radiograph promptly after placement and before first use of an internal jugular or subclavian dialysis catheter (1B). We suggest not using topical antibiotics over the skin insertion site of a nontunneled dialysis catheter in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with AKI requiring RRT (2C), and we suggest not using antibiotic locks for prevention of catheter-related infections of nontunneled dialysis catheters in AKI requiring RRT (2C).

P157 A survey of practice for central venous catheter placement confirmation methods

K Chen, C Day

Royal Devon & Exeter Hospital, Critical Care, Exeter, United Kingdom

Introduction: Once a central venous catheter (CVC) has been inserted, its position should be confirmed and complications excluded. Ultrasound is commonly used to aid insertion but the extent to which it is used in confirmation of site and exclusion of complications is not known for the UK.

Methods: We conducted a telephone survey contacting all critical care units in England. The nurse in charge or an Advanced Critical Care Practitioner was asked to provide information about what constituted usual practice for most CVC lines inserted in their ICU. If they were busy a call back was arranged. If this failed then a further call was made to that ICU.

Results: 147 of the 190 ICU contacted provided information (77%). 94.6% used ultrasound to confirm the position of the guide wire during insertion. This could include exclusion of a wire in the subclavian vein or visualisation as far caudally as possible. 95.2% of units used a chest X-ray. 65.3% used waveform analysis from the line. 42.9% would use ultrasound to look for the catheter tip and/or to exclude pneumothorax. 35.4% used a blood gas taken from the line.

Conclusions: There is still a great dependancy on the chest x-ray to confirm position and exclude complications following CVC insertion. USS is used, mostly as an adjunct in confirming position and excluding complications. The use of USS is very dependant on an operator being available. There were several comments that practice during the day was different to those at night. During the day there was more likely to be a skilled operator, able to use USS for confirmation of line site and placement.

### Which arm and vein are more appropriate for single-step, non-fluoroscopic, peripherally inserted central catheter insertion? [^c24ec3b3]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

We investigated which arm and vein led to the most successful outcomes during non-fluoroscopic peripherallyinserted central catheter (PICC) insertion.

Methods

A total of 743 cases from July 2012 to March 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. We also analyzed the following: 1) accessed arm (right or left), 2) accessed vein (cephalic, basilic, or brachial), 3) primary and secondary success rates, 4) causes of failure (location of obstacles), and 5) problemsolving methods for catheter repositioning.

Results

The primary success rate was 46.3% (344/743) with 49.4% (123/249) on the right arm and 44.7% (273/494) on the left arm. The secondary success rate was 53.7% (399/743) with 50.6% (126/249) on the right arm and 55.3% (273/494) on the left arm. The causes of failure were 100% (43/43) for the left cephalic vein, 61.5% (8/13) for the right cephalic vein, 50.6% (43/85) for the left brachial vein, and 51.1% (23/45) for the right brachial vein, 51.1% (187/366) for the left basilic vein, and 49.7% (95/191) for the right basilic vein. The failure rate through the left cephalic vein was significantly higher than that for other veins. The most common locations of obstacles were the subclavian vein (28.8%, 115/399), axillary vein (24.3%, 97/399), and brachiocephalic vein (19.3%, 77/399). The most common problem-solving methods were with guidewire assistance (74.7%, 298/399), venographic guidance (13.8%, 55/399), and fluoroscopic guidance (11.5%, 46/399).

Conclusions

Right-arm access through the basilic or brachial vein may be more appropriate for successful nonfluoroscopic PICC insertion compared with the access through the left arm and the cephalic vein.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^f97026a1]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) dialysis catheter site selection prioritization states that the subclavian vein is "the last choice for insertion of a dialysis catheter in patients with AKI" and, because "the subclavian vein should be avoided", the remaining options are the jugular and femoral veins. In a randomized multicenter trial of 750 AKI patients comparing first renal replacement therapy (RRT) catheter placement, mean duration was 6.2 days (femoral) versus 6.9 days (jugular), bloodstream infection did not differ at 2.3 per 1000 catheter-days (jugular) versus 1.5 per 1000 catheter-days (femoral), and 20% of catheters were antiseptic-impregnated. Observational data indicate more malfunctioning and shorter actuarial survival for femoral than jugular catheters, more malfunction with left-sided versus right-sided jugular catheters, and recirculation more frequent in femoral than subclavian or jugular catheters, especially with shorter femoral catheters; therefore, "Femoral catheters are preferred over left jugular catheters because of more frequent malfunction, and the subclavian vein should only be considered a rescue option". For transplant candidates, patients "should not have a femoral catheter placed" and catheter insertion should follow infection-control policies with "maximal sterile barrier precautions" and "chlorhexidine 2% skin antisepsis". Overall, "there are no clear data to support a strong preference between the femoral and jugular insertion site in the general AKI population for insertion of a dialysis catheter".

### Complications and its risk factors of percutaneous subclavian vein catheters in pediatric patients: enhancing the outcomes of a university hospital in a low-income and middle-income country [^933a1a79]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

We collected data from infants and children referred to the pediatric surgery department for percutaneous infraclavicular subclavian vein catheterization under general anesthesia in the period lasting from July 2021 to September 2022, with regular follow-up visits until 1 month later.

In this study, we included all children aged 3 months to 14 years admitted to the pediatric surgery department for infraclavicular subclavian central vein catheter placement. We included medical, surgical, critically ill, and hematology/oncology patients. We did not include patients with subclavian vein thrombosis, fracture of the clavicle, or local infection at the insertion site. Neonates and patients whose parents did not consent to participate in the study were not included. We excluded cases of placement failure and patients who died before the removal of the catheter if the death was not caused by catheter complications.

The variables included demographic parameters (age, age < 1 year, weight, weight < 10 kg, comorbidities, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class, history of central venous access, context, and indications for catheter placement). The main indications were difficult venous access or inability to obtain peripheral venous access, parenteral nutrition, major surgery requiring prolonged infusion, and chemotherapy. We assessed the difficulty of catheter insertion by assessing the duration of the insertion procedure, the number of punctures (number of attempts), and the occurrence of an accidental arterial puncture. A difficult catheter placement was considered when the physician needed more than two attempts to insert the catheter. To assess catheter-related complications, the site was inspected, and the nurses' reports were reviewed daily. The complications assessed were infection or central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), bleeding and/or hematoma, pneumothorax, vein thrombosis or vein damage, nerve damage, air embolism, and mechanical complications such as dislodgement and malposition. The duration of a catheter was defined as the length of the period between placement and removal. Early removal was considered when the duration of the catheter was < 10 days.

Catheter insertion site selection — risk considerations for infection and thrombosis emphasize that the density of skin flora at the catheter insertion site is a major risk factor for catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI); no single trial has satisfactorily compared infection rates for catheters placed in jugular, subclavian, and femoral veins; internal jugular placement has usually been associated with higher risk for colonization and/or CRBSI than subclavian placement; femoral catheters in adults have high colonization rates compared with subclavian and internal jugular sites and, in some studies, higher rates of CLABSIs; femoral catheters are also associated with a higher risk for deep vein thrombosis than internal jugular or subclavian catheters; infection risk with femoral placement may be accentuated in obese patients; in adult patients, a subclavian site is preferred for infection-control purposes although other factors should be considered; and catheters should be inserted far from open wounds because burn wound overlap of the 2.5-cm area surrounding the insertion site was associated with catheters being 1.79 times more likely to be colonized and 2.15 times more likely to be associated with bacteremia.

### The value of real-time ultrasound-guidance for definite placement of a right supraclavicular subclavian central venous catheter [^ccc8c44d]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2022). Medium credibility.

Central venous catheters (CVC) are widely used in critically ill patients and in those undergoing major surgery. Significant adverse events, such as pneumothorax and hemothorax, can be caused by needle insertion during CVC insertion. CVC misplacement is less often described, yet equally important, as it can lead to deleterious complications. Here, we describe a case in which misplacement of a guidewire following infraclavicular puncture of the right axillary vein was detected by continuous ultrasound employing the right supraclavicular fossa view. Utilizing this ultrasound view, the insertion approach to the vessel was changed and correct CVC placement could be achieved. While ultrasound guidance is widely accepted for vessel puncture, this case demonstrates the value of continuous ultrasound guidance for the entire process of CVC insertion: vessel puncture, correct guidewire advancement, catheter placement, and exclusion of complications such as pneumothorax. It also shows that there should be a high index of suspicion for guidewire misplacement, even after successful venipuncture. In conclusion, ultrasound protocols covering the complete CVC insertion process should be implemented into current clinical practice.

### Arterial steal syndrome: a modest proposal for an old paradigm [^da1d2c84]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Access ligation has been considered to be the treatment for patients presenting with arterial steal syndrome by many nephrologists. We report results of a prospective study using comprehensive arteriography coupled with percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTA) or surgical intervention to evaluate and manage steal syndrome.

Methods

Twelve consecutive patients referred for symptoms of steal syndrome were examined. Comprehensive arteriography of the extremity to diagnose arterial stenoses and delineate anatomy was performed by advancing a diagnostic catheter into the subclavian artery. Findings of arteriography and degrees of stenosis before and after PTA also were documented. Resolution of symptoms after PTA and surgical interventions, as well as complications, were recorded.

Results

Angiography showed arterial stenotic lesions in 10 of 12 patients (83%). The degree of stenosis was 66% ± 14% (SD). Eight patients (80%) with stenotic lesions underwent PTA successfully. The degree of stenosis after PTA was 13% ± 10%. The remaining 2 patients were not considered candidates for PTA and were referred to surgery with arteriography images. One patient underwent ligation and the other patient required an axillary loop fistula using the same outflow vein. The 2 patients without stenoses showed excessive steal through the anastomosis and underwent lengthening procedures by insertion of a vein segment. All 12 patients are symptom free with a mean follow-up of 8.3 ± 4 months, and 11 of 12 patients (92%) are dialyzing using the same access. There were no procedure-related complications.

Conclusion

We suggest that complete imaging of the arterial circulation of the extremity be considered in patients presenting with symptoms of steal syndrome to properly assess the arterial anatomy and develop a treatment strategy.

### Efficacy of an implementation package on documentation of central venous catheter insertions: an observational study [^4ddb0a44]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Limitations

The study is a post hoc analysis in a single healthcare system and hence there is a risk of bias and limited external validity. Even though there is a strong tradition in the studied departments to document every CVC insertion in the EHR, there may be a small number of CVCs that are not entered at all and therefore the number of incomplete entries may be underestimated. An estimation of the true number of undocumented CVC insertions could not be performed.

Further, due to an older insertion template in the study by Björkander et al.⁠ with data through 2016, it was not possible to compare the completion of all 13 key terms before and after the introduction of the implementation package. Although we have no reason to suspect that the baseline from 2016 to the start of the present study has changed, this cannot definitely be ruled out.

Finally, it should be noted that the observational time may have been too short to definitely rule out a short-lived Hawthorne effect.

### Improving central venous catheter insertion documentation to facilitate electronic surveillance of bundle compliance [^f96a1b1c]. American Journal of Infection Control (2011). Low credibility.

We developed an electronic surveillance system and modified electronic medical record and documentation practices to allow automated tracking of the central line bundle documentation with the insertion of central venous catheters. Despite significant improvements in documented use of the central line bundle in > 80% of insertions, our central line-associated bloodstream infection rate remained unchanged, suggesting the need to further improve compliance toward a goal of 100% of central line insertions, as well as training and education on proper line maintenance for catheters that are medically required for prolonged periods.

Recommendations

Hospitals should establish dedicated vascular access specialist teams with a designated clinical lead. Anaesthetists are in a strong position to lead on this multidisciplinary approach to the provision and development of vascular access services.
Vascular access specialist teams should work with other stakeholders to ensure appropriate hospital and community vascular access standards and to monitor these standards against locally agreed key performance indicators, using regular audit and review. Responsiveness indicators should be included to ensure timely and expert insertion.
A comprehensive and holistic approach to vascular access for all patients is paramount. This entails thorough vein and lifestyle assessments; tailored discussions and consent procedures; safe insertion practices; meticulous documentation; early identification and management of complications; and timely removal of devices, all aimed at preserving long‐term vein health.
Every patient should have timely access to the insertion of commonly used vascular access devices. For patients classified as having difficult intravenous access, consideration should be given to early involvement of specialised vascular access teams for long‐term access solutions.
The integration of Local Safety Standards for Invasive Procedures (LocSSIPs) into vascular access procedures is essential, including mechanisms to prevent retained guidewires and minimise complications. Steps should include: appropriate consent and procedural verification; team brief; sign‐in; time‐out; safe insertion with reconciliation of equipment; sign‐out; and handover, debrief and documentation. Lines or dilators that have been placed in an artery inadvertently and are ≥ 6 Fr should be left in place and their safe removal discussed urgently with interventional radiologists or vascular surgeons.
Real‐time ultrasound guidance should be employed for all central vein access and other applicable access sites to enhance the success and safety of procedures; a 'scouting' ultrasound should take place immediately before the procedure using sterile ultrasound gel. When ultrasound is necessary for peripheral cannulation, consideration should be given to using a long peripheral catheter or midline over a short peripheral catheter to mitigate the risk of extravasation injury.
To preserve vessel health, catheters should ideally occupy no more than one‐third of the cross‐sectional area of the vessel, with at least one‐third of the catheter situated intraluminally. Selecting the appropriate vein to maintain a haemodilution ratio of ≥ 3 (three parts blood to one part drug) helps minimise vein wall damage from irritant agents. Larger, high‐flow veins provide better dilution and are preferred for such drugs.
Optimal positioning for upper body central venous catheter tips includes the lower third of the superior vena cava, cavo‐atrial junction or high right atrium; this ensures maximum blood flow and dilution and reduces the risk of vessel injury and thrombosis. The movement of peripherally inserted central catheters into the body with arm adduction should be considered. Real‐time imaging or ECG guidance should be used for long‐term catheters. Lower body catheter tips should ideally be sited in the inferior vena cava, with long‐term catheter tips positioned above the level of the renal veins.
Recommendations are given for the management of patients undergoing anticoagulation therapy or those with underlying coagulation disorders. Local protocols should be developed, aligning with national guidance. Different sizes and types of vascular access device require different safety thresholds. In general, no treatment is required before an uncomplicated insertion of a peripherally inserted central catheter or non‐tunnelled central venous catheter.
The presence of a central venous catheter is a major predisposing factor to venous thrombosis. Regarding catheter‐related central venous thrombosis, if the catheter remains necessary, in good position, uninfected, functional and not jeopardising the limb, it may be left in situ, with the patient receiving anticoagulation as per local protocols.
In patients with chronic kidney disease who may require renal replacement therapy, consideration of vein preservation and long‐term vein health is vital. Protection of veins that may be required for the creation of an arteriovenous fistula (such as the basilic and cephalic vein) is particularly important.
Mastectomy and axillary lymph node resection are not considered absolute contraindications for short‐term ipsilateral vein cannulation. Peripherally inserted central catheter insertion and axillary/subclavian vein insertion should be avoided in arms at risk or with evidence of lymphoedema.
Potent peripheral vasoconstrictors such as noradrenaline may be infused for short durations through appropriately positioned short peripheral catheters and at dilute concentrations. Strict protocols should be followed.
Training in postinsertion care, maintenance, flushing techniques and early complication recognition should be mandatory for all healthcare providers who work with vascular access devices.
Training schemes in advanced vascular access should be developed at a national level; where appropriate, these should be open to non‐medical staff.

Ultrasound-guided subclavian (SCV) and axillary vein access — probe orientation and approach: In US-guided SCV access, the probe is placed perpendicular to the mid-clavicle near the first rib to identify key structures, and cannulation can be performed in short-axis (SAX) or long-axis (LAX) with LAX aligned to venous flow; for axillary vein cannulation, proximal and distal ultrasound-guided approaches are described, with the proximal probe near the middle third of the clavicle, the distal needle entry approximately a third of the clavicle–axilla distance, and skin puncture occurring at a 45° angle, after which ultrasound can confirm correct guidewire position and exclude malposition; pleural-line imaging can help exclude pneumothorax, and the "blind" supraclavicular approach (without ultrasound) has been largely abandoned due to a high incidence of pneumothorax.

### Percutaneous closure of accidentally subclavian artery catheterization: time to change first line approach? [^71374c08]. CVIR Endovascular (2022). Medium credibility.

Materials & methods

Since October 2020, first approach to treat unintentional artery cannulations of the upper extremity was managed with PP. All patients were preventively studied with CT angiography to confirm the site of arterial puncture and its relationship with contiguous structures and arterial branches. A doppler US was also performed to exclude the presence of arteriovenous fistulas.

Technical procedure

All the procedures are performed in hybrid room under local anesthesia. The upper chest, neck, and right groin or right radial area are draped in a sterile fashion. Primary vascular access was ultrasound-guided through the common femoral artery (Radifocus Introducer 7Fr, Terumo, Japan) or radial artery (Prelude Ideal 7 F Merit, USA).

A preliminary angiography is performed to localize central venous line entrance into the artery wall. An 8-mm diameter occlusion balloon catheter is then advanced close to the damaged artery for hemostasis in case of VCD failure. The venous catheter is withdrawn on a 0.035-inch guidewire (Radifocus M guidewire standard type, Terumo, Japan) and a PP is inserted and deployed.

Completion angiography is performed to confirm the success of the procedure (Fig. 1). In case of persistent bleeding, a second device can be positioned, or, alternatively, a balloon inflated or stent graft deployed through the primary access.

Fig. 1

An 8-mm diameter occlusion balloon catheter is placed in the subclavian artery near the entry point of the misplaced central venous catheter. b Angiogram executed after the deployment of the PP and during the tightening of the knot. On the upper side, the slipknot is located close to the arterial wall (arrow). c Final angiogram confirming the absence of active bleeding, stenosis or pseudoaneurysm

Clinical outcomes

Primary outcome is technical and clinical success. Technical success is defined as absence of bleeding signs at completion angiography, while clinical success is a composite endpoint defined as absence of hematoma, hemoglobin loss at 12 and 24 h, and absence of procedure-related reintervention (due to vessel stenosis, pseudoaneurysm or distal embolization).

Secondary outcomes are procedural time, fluoroscopy time, and amount of iodinate contrast medium used.

All patients were informed that the device used for hemostasis was not designed/tested for the specific purpose and gave their consent to treatment.

When choosing a vein for insertion of a dialysis catheter in patients with AKI, consider these preferences (Not Graded): First choice: right jugular vein; Second choice: femoral vein; Third choice: left jugular vein; Last choice: subclavian vein with preference for the dominant side. We recommend using ultrasound guidance for dialysis catheter insertion (1A). We recommend obtaining a chest radiograph promptly after placement and before first use of an internal jugular or subclavian dialysis catheter (1B). We suggest not using topical antibiotics over the skin insertion site of a nontunneled dialysis catheter in ICU (intensive care unit) patients with AKI requiring RRT (2C), and we suggest not using antibiotic locks for prevention of catheter-related infections of nontunneled dialysis catheters in AKI requiring RRT (2C).

### AIUM practice parameter for the use of ultrasound to guide vascular access procedures [^6d44f02e]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Subclavian/axillary central venous access — overview and evidence note that while the utility of ultrasound guidance for IJ vein cannulation is well demonstrated, the subclavian vein access site has been shown to have lower rates of infection and a preferred site of access by some practitioners, but in most dialysis patients the subclavian site is contraindicated because of the high incidence of stenosis related to dialysis catheters unless no other ipsilateral upper extremity access is planned. While ultrasound-guided IJ access may result in fewer complications than subclavian vein access, the literature is less clear on the use of ultrasound in aiding subclavian vein access. Interference from the clavicle hinders the utility of ultrasound for subclavian access; however, the axillary vein, which drains into the subclavian vein lateral to the outer border of the first rib at the teres major muscle, can be easily visualized using ultrasound. There is also lack of clarity in the literature about whether studies in this area refer to direct subclavian vein access or subclavian vein access via the axillary vein.

Difficult central venous catheter insertion

Difficult access occurs frequently 24 and is more likely with previous multiple attempts, insertion site scars and long‐term access. Distended superficial collateral veins suggest deeper vein blockage or stenosis. Doppler ultrasound of great vessels gives limited imaging of the subclavian vein and SVC; contrast venography/CT/MRI may be indicated, dependent on urgency.

If difficulty is predicted, insertions should be performed under X‐ray control with appropriate radiation protection 25. High‐resolution ultrasound should be used with colour Doppler to study flow. Input from interventional radiology and surgery may be needed.

A 'difficult access' trolley is useful, with additional instruments, X‐ray contrast, sterile drapes and ultrasound probe covers, standard (18G) and micro‐puncture needles (20‐21G), and compatible guidewires (0.018″ and 0.32″).

Guidewires come in various lengths, with different coatings and tips (e.g. straight, angled, soft tip or full 'J'). It is best to be familiar with a small range. Catheters of 12–24 cm length should be available for adults. Guidewires should be checked for damage and adherent clot removed with a wet swab. A selection of compatible dilators and peel‐away sheaths is needed.

Use of a 4–5 Fr introducer sheath allows manipulation of guidewires while minimising the risk of damaging the wire or vein; it also acts as a conduit for contrast injection or advancement of specialist catheters/wires.

X‐ray contrast is used to image vascular anatomy, identify complications and confirm line position/patency. It may cause anaphylaxis. Contrast nephropathy is unlikely in doses used for venous access 26.

### Pneumothorax is a rare complication of thoracic central venous catheterization in community EDs [^8925b631]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

The rate of iatrogenic pneumothorax associated with thoracic central venous catheterization in community emergency departments (EDs) is poorly described, although such information is vital to inform the procedure's risk/benefit analysis. We undertook this multicenter study to estimate the incidence of immediate catheter-related pneumothorax in community EDs and to determine associations with site of access, failed access, and positive pressure ventilation.

Methods

This was a secondary analysis of 2 retrospective cohort studies of adults who underwent attempted thoracic central venous catheterization in 1 of 21 EDs. Pneumothorax was identified by postprocedural anteroposterior chest radiograph or emergent evacuation for presumed tension pneumothorax. Frequencies were compared using Fisher's exact test.

Results

Among 1249 patient encounters, the initial vein of catheterization was internal jugular in 1054 cases (84.4%) and subclavian in 195 cases (15.6%). Success at the initial internal jugular vein was more common than at the initial subclavian vein (95.4% vs 83.6%, P < .001). Periprocedural positive pressure ventilation was administered in 316 patients (25.3%). We identified 6 pneumothoraces (0.5%; 95% confidence interval, 0.2%-1.1%). The incidence of pneumothorax was higher with the subclavian vein than the internal jugular vein (2.3% vs 0.1%, P < .001), with failed access at the initial vein (2.5% vs 0.3%, P = 0.05), and among patients receiving positive pressure ventilation (1.6% vs 0.1%, P < .01).

Conclusion

The incidence of pneumothorax from thoracic central venous catheterization in community EDs is low. The risk of pneumothorax is higher with a subclavian vein approach, failed access at the initial vein, and positive pressure ventilation.

### Safety in training for ultrasound guided internal jugular vein CVC placement: a propensity score analysis [^f867dd70]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The routine technique for CVC placement at our institution is the out-of-plane technique: the probe is kept in a transverse position relative to the vessel while the needle is advanced following an out-of-plane view (Fig. 1). After catheter insertion all the data relative to the procedure (number of operators, technique and complications) are reported on a specific register.

Fig. 1
Out of plane technique

We divided the CVC positioning procedures in two groups according to the operator's proficiency (NPO group and PO group).

Proficiency was defined acquired during the residency on case by case evaluation as per local institution protocol, usually it is 'acquired' when last year residents performed at least 50 or more catheterizations.

Primary outcome was the rate of procedure failure, defined as the need for hands-on assistance of another operator during the procedure. Secondary outcome was the rate of procedure complication (arterial puncture, hematoma formation at the puncture site, pneumothorax, hemothorax and CVC malposition) in NPO and PO groups.

Needs for hands-on assistance, arterial puncture and hematoma formation were evaluated through inspection of the procedure room register.

Hemothorax, pneumothorax and incorrect CVC position were evaluated through inspection of the post-procedure chest radiography and the CVC was defined as malpositioned if the tip of the catheter was placed outside veins or in subclavian, axillary or contralateral jugular vein. Arterial puncture rate was retrieved from procedure chart while hematoma formation was evaluated from both procedure chart and patient diary for the first 24 h post-procedure.

To avoid bias arising from patient and catheter characteristics the following patients' data were collected: age (years), gender (M/F), CVC diameter (Fr), site of insertion and laboratory tests (Prothrombin Time (PT), Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) and platelets count).

### Ultrasound guidance versus anatomical landmarks for internal jugular vein catheterization [^cf368fc0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Central venous catheters (CVCs) can help with diagnosis and treatment of the critically ill. The catheter may be placed in a large vein in the neck (internal jugular vein), upper chest (subclavian vein) or groin (femoral vein). Whilst this is beneficial overall, inserting the catheter risks arterial puncture and other complications and should be performed with as few attempts as possible. Traditionally, anatomical 'landmarks' on the body surface were used to find the correct place in which to insert catheters, but ultrasound imaging is now available. A Doppler mode is sometimes used to supplement plain 'two-dimensional' ultrasound.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of two-dimensional (imaging ultrasound (US) or ultrasound Doppler (USD)) guided puncture techniques for insertion of central venous catheters via the internal jugular vein in adults and children. We assessed whether there was a difference in complication rates between traditional landmark-guided and any ultrasound-guided central vein puncture. Our secondary objectives were to assess whether the effect differs between US and USD; whether the effect differs between ultrasound used throughout the puncture ('direct') and ultrasound used only to identify and mark the vein before the start of the puncture procedure (indirect'); and whether the effect differs between different groups of patients or between different levels of experience among those inserting the catheters.

Search Methods

We searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to 15 January 2013), EMBASE (1966 to 15 January 2013), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to 15 January 2013), reference lists of articles, 'grey literature' and dissertations. An additional handsearch focused on intensive care and anaesthesia journals and abstracts and proceedings of scientific meetings. We attempted to identify unpublished or ongoing studies by contacting companies and experts in the field, and we searched trial registers. We reran the search in August 2014. We will deal with identified studies of interest when we update the review.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing two-dimensional ultrasound or Doppler ultrasound with an anatomical 'landmark' technique during insertion of internal jugular venous catheters in both adults and children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently extracted data on methodological quality, participants, interventions and outcomes of interest using a standardized form. A priori, we aimed to perform subgroup analyses, when possible, for adults and children, and for experienced operators and inexperienced operators.

Main Results

Of 735 identified citations, 35 studies enrolling 5108 participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The quality of evidence was very low for most of the outcomes and was moderate at best for four of the outcomes. Most trials had an unclear risk of bias across the six domains, and heterogeneity among the studies was significant. Use of two-dimensional ultrasound reduced the rate of total complications overall by 71% (14 trials, 2406 participants, risk ratio (RR) 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.52; P value < 0.0001, I² = 57%), and the number of participants with an inadvertent arterial puncture by 72% (22 trials, 4388 participants, RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.44; P value < 0.00001, I² = 35%). Overall success rates were modestly increased in all groups combined at 12% (23 trials, 4340 participants, RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.17; P value < 0.00001, I² = 85%), and similar benefit was noted across all subgroups. The number of attempts needed for successful cannulation was decreased overall (16 trials, 3302 participants, mean difference (MD) -1.19 attempts, 95% CI -1.45 to -0.92; P value < 0.00001, I² = 96%) and in all subgroups. Use of two-dimensional ultrasound increased the chance of success at the first attempt by 57% (18 trials, 2681 participants, RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.36 to 1.82; P value < 0.00001, I² = 82%) and reduced the chance of haematoma formation (overall reduction 73%, 13 trials, 3233 participants, RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.55; P value 0.0004, I² = 54%). Use of two-dimensional ultrasound decreased the time to successful cannulation by 30.52 seconds (MD -30.52 seconds, 95% CI -55.21 to -5.82; P value 0.02, I² = 97%). Additional data are available to support use of ultrasound during, not simply before, line insertion. Use of Doppler ultrasound increased the chance of success at the first attempt by 58% (four trials, 199 participants, RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.43; P value 0.04, I² = 57%). No evidence showed a difference for the total numbers of perioperative and postoperative complications/adverse events (three trials, 93 participants, RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.71; P value 0.28), the overall success rate (seven trials, 289 participants, RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.25; P value 0.20), the total number of attempts until success (two trials, 69 participants, MD -0.63, 95% CI -1.92 to 0.66; P value 0.34), the overall number of participants with an arterial puncture (six trials, 213 participants, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.73; P value 0.35) and time to successful cannulation (five trials, 214 participants, each using a different definition for this outcome; MD 62.04 seconds, 95% CI -13.47 to 137.55; P value 0.11) when Doppler ultrasound was used. It was not possible to perform analyses for the other outcomes because they were reported in only one trial.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on available data, we conclude that two-dimensional ultrasound offers gains in safety and quality when compared with an anatomical landmark technique. Because of missing data, we did not compare effects with experienced versus inexperienced operators for all outcomes (arterial puncture, haematoma formation, other complications, success with attempt number one), and so the relative utility of ultrasound in these groups remains unclear and no data are available on use of this technique in patients at high risk of complications. The results for Doppler ultrasound techniques versus anatomical landmark techniques are also uncertain.

### Ultrasound-guided central venous access… [^ca2b090f]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

Bilateral upper extremity venogram showing occlusion of both subclavian veins and the right innominant vein. Not demonstrated was the occluded right internal jugular vein. The left internal jugular vein was patent, but it was used for a large-bore double-lumen dialysis catheter placement. If the probe is oriented as shown, an image of the subclavian vein is obtained, but the scan plane's parabolic shape runs parallel to the pleura. This relationship is not shown in the ultrasound image. Care must be taken to stay in the middle of the scan plane in order to prevent the needle from being placed into the pleural space, although on the screen it appears that the needle is headed toward the subclavian vein. Interventions Real-time ultrasound evaluation of the proposed vein to be cannulated, followed by real-time percutaneous central vein access. Main Outcome Measures Successful cannulation of a central vein. Results All attempts at central vein cannulation were successful.

No bleeding complications occurred. One pneumothorax occurred in an obese patient. In the general population, central venous access is safe. 4 Immediate complications include pneumothorax, bleeding, arterial puncture, catheter malposition, and death. Long-term complications include infection, catheter malfunction, catheter or vein thrombosis, and the potential for pulmonary embolus. Relative contraindications to central venous access include hypovolemia, bleeding disorders, the inability to assume a supine or Trendelenburg position, central vein occlusion, and the inability of the patient to physiologically tolerate complications, such as a pneumothorax. Central venous cannulation was successful in all patients. The subclavian vein was used in 43 patients, internal jugular vein in 7, and innominant vein in 2. In 3 patients, an unsuspected venous occlusion was diagnosed before the procedure was performed.

Another site was chosen with ultrasound imaging and was cannulated successfully. No bleeding complications occurred in patients with clotting disturbances. One pneumothorax occurred in a patient with an extended body habitus in which inadequate local anesthesia caused the patient to move with pain at a depth of 10 cm. In 1 hypovolemic patient, the "J" guide wire would not go into the vein, despite the ability to aspirate blood. Substitution of a straight guide wire with a flexible tip allowed completion of the procedure.

### Complications and its risk factors of percutaneous subclavian vein catheters in pediatric patients: enhancing the outcomes of a university hospital in a low-income and middle-income country [^7ae4d57a]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

In our study, the main risk factor was multiple catheter placement attempts. To reduce this risk, we suggest the use of ultrasound-guided techniques. Previous research found that the ultrasound-guided technique had a lower failure and complication rate than the anatomic landmark technique. This use of ultrasounds may facilitate access to the supraclavicular and internal jugular veins, which seems more suitable than the subclavian vein for children requiring the central line for only a few days, such as surgical and medical patients. It can also help in central line placement even in newborns with low birth weight. Changing the habits of all healthcare teams (physicians, nurses, anesthetists, etc) requires several teaching actions to convince them to be more implicated in our healthcare quality improvement approach.

At the moment of catheter removal, several rare and dangerous complications have been reported. However, the workload and the lack of physicians made us delegate this mission to nurses.

Although there are several barriers to improving our pediatric difficult venous access outcomes, we have achieved some advantages by changing habits, such as using SVCs in place of Broviac catheters, which were overused previously despite their higher rates of complications (60.2%), but there is still a large gap to an advanced country.

In conclusion, high rates of complicated SVCs were associated with difficult catheter placement and children with comorbidities, particularly children with severe thrombocytopenia. This study gave us feedback on our habits and warned us about our deficiencies. Deduced risk factors allowed us to guide actions required to reduce catheter-related morbidity. We suggest an ultrasound-guided approach and multidisciplinary teaching program to improve nursing skills and the use of less invasive devices for patients with cancer.

### Ultrasound-guided subclavian vein cannulation in low birth weight neonates [^27a9cea0]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Central venous access in critically ill, small infants remains technically challenging even in experienced hands. Several vascular accesses exist, but the subclavian vein is often preferred for central venous catheter insertion in infants where abdominal malformation and/or closure of the vein preclude the use of umbilical venous catheters, as catheterization of the subclavian vein is easier in very short necks than the internal jugular vein for age-related anatomical reasons. The subclavian vein approach is yet relatively undescribed in low birth weight infants (i.e., < 2,500g), and this study aims to explore the feasibility of this technique in very small infants.

Design

Retrospective data collection of prospectively registered data on central venous catheter insertion in infants.

Setting

Neonatal ICU and PICU at a university hospital.

Patients

One hundred and five newborn children hospitalized in at the ICU.

Interventions

An ultrasound-guided supraclavicular approach was applied on all infants who had an subclavian vein catheterization during a 30-month period from January 2013 to July 2015.

One hundred seven supraclavicular subclavian vein catheters were placed in 105 children weighing less than 5,000g. Among those, 40 patients weighed less than 2,500g and 10 patients weighed less than 1,500g. Successful central venous catheter insertion, defined as the correct placement of a functional double-lumen catheter (3F or 4F), was obtained in 97.3%. All three registered failed attempts were due to hematomas from venous bleeding and occurred in infants weighing greater than 2,500g. No case of accidental arterial puncture or pleural puncture was registered.

Conclusions

This large series of subclavian vein catheterizations in small infants demonstrates the feasibility of subclavian vein catheterizations even in very small neonates weighing less than 1,500g.

### Long-term outcome of radiological-guided insertion of implanted central venous access port devices (CVAPD) for the delivery of chemotherapy in cancer patients: institutional experience and review of the literature [^268bca00]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Patient selection

All patients had histologically confirmed malignancy other than leukaemia and required the insertion of a CVAPD for the administration of chemotherapy. Approval for the study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board, and all patients gave informed consent.

The CVAPD were inserted with fluoroscopic guidance by one of three interventional radiologists as an outpatient procedure. All CVAPDs were inserted into the subclavian vein. When possible, the right subclavian vein was used for technical ease of right-handed operators. In all, 54 patients had insertion of a BardPort® with an 8F Groshong® catheter (Bard Inc. Salt Lake City, USA), while 57 had a Vital-Port® with a 6.5F silicone catheter (Cook Vascular Corporation, Pennsylvania, USA). A full blood count and coagulation studies were performed prior to the procedure and patients and their carers received education prior to and following CVAPD insertion.

At the commencement of the procedure, patients received midazolam 2 mg i.v. and pethidine 25–100 mg i.v. with further increments of midazolam being administered as required during the procedure. Local anaesthetic was injected into the skin surrounding the planned puncture site after preparation of the skin. All patients received cephalothin 1 g i.v. as prophylaxis against infection or 300 mg oral clindamycin if there was a history of penicillin/cephalosporin allergy. A mixture of 50 mL of contrast (Ultravist 370) and saline 30 mL was injected peripherally to identify the site of subclavian vein puncture. A postprocedural chest X-ray (CXR) was performed to document final catheter position and to exclude pneumothorax. Warfarin 1 mg orally daily was commenced after CVAPD insertion in order to prevent catheter thrombosis.

The patients and CVAPD were assessed by Oncology nursing staff immediately postinsertion and most CVAPDs were accessed immediately. Follow-up assessment occurred at intervals of 4 weeks or less. The patient was questioned about symptoms suggestive of infection and problems with catheter function, and the insertion site was examined for evidence of infection, bruising or other complication. Patients were followed until the device was removed or the patient died. Complications were classified as acute if they occurred within 1 week of insertion of the device, and delayed if they occurred after this. CVAPD infection was defined as a positive blood culture with no other obvious source of infection.

### Insertion site for central venous catheters… [^307a6b6a]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor Patel and colleagues1 wrote that central venous catheters should be placed in the internal jugular vein "which carries a lower risk of infection than the subclavian route". This statement is unsubstantiated from studies published to date, and this is not the recommendation in recent guidelines. 2, 3 For short-term, nontunneled central venous catheters inserted in the intensive care unit, our meta-analysis suggested that subclavian insertion is associated with a lower risk of infection. 4 In addition, the anatomic site used to insert a port for administration of chemotherapy had no effect on infectious and noninfectious complications. 5 Ultimately, decisions regarding which anatomic site to insert a central venous catheter depend on patient-specific risk factors, availability of ultrasound guidance, and experience of the inserter.

### Brachial plexus injury following subclavian vein catheterization: a case report [^8dd6ce54]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2003). Low credibility.

Subclavian vein cannulation may be complicated by lesions of the peripheral nervous system, such as injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, phrenic nerve, and brachial plexus. We describe a case of lesion of the upper trunk of the brachial plexus during multiple attempts at subclavian vein catheterization. This type of complication, ascribed to erroneous application of procedures or anatomical variations, may be minimized by abstaining from multiple attempts at venipuncture.

### Ultrasound-guided vs. landmark method for subclavian vein catheterization in an academic emergency department [^660e3d99]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Ultrasound guidance has been shown to decrease complication rates and improve success for internal jugular and femoral vein catheterization in the emergency department (ED). However, the current data on the efficacy and safety of ultrasound-guided subclavian vein catheterization has failed to provide support for similar conclusions.

Objective

To determine if ultrasound-guided subclavian vein catheterization is safer and more efficacious than the traditional landmark method in an ED setting.

Methods

A prospective randomized trial was conducted from April 2004 through June 2009 in an urban tertiary care academic ED with an annual census of > 50,000 patients. Four primary data endpoints were calculated: 1) overall success for both resident and attending physicians; 2) number of attempts by each group of providers; 3) complication rate with each method; and 4) time to which the subclavian line was obtained.

Results

Eighty-five patients were enrolled in the study. The ultrasound method was more successful in obtaining subclavian catheter placement when compared with the landmark method. When comparing successful cannulation attempts in both groups, the ultrasound group showed a statistically significant longer time to success when compared with the landmark group. There was no difference in the success or complication rates between residents and attending physicians. There was no significant difference in complications rates between ultrasound-guided and landmark methods.

Conclusion

Ultrasound-guided subclavian vein catheterization was found to be associated with a higher overall success rate compared with the landmark method with no significant difference with respect to complication rate in an ED setting. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Cardiac arrhythmias

Arrhythmias may be precipitated by guidewires or catheters stimulating the heart 43. They are usually caused by insertion beyond the predicted length of catheter for that insertion site, and usually settle on guidewire/catheter withdrawal. Electrocardiographic monitoring throughout all upper body CVC insertions is advisable.

Venous air embolism

Air embolism may be fatal and occur at any time from insertion to removal. The incidence may be as high as 0.8% 42. Prevention requires careful insertion/removal techniques, secure fixation and safe handling when accessing the catheter. Presentation ranges from subtle neurological, respiratory or cardiovascular signs to shock, loss of consciousness and cardiac arrest. Chronic forms may exist. If suspected, damaged catheters should be clamped, pressure and wet dressings applied, and occlusive dressings used. Head‐down, left lateral tilt and attempted aspiration of air via the line may be useful.

Guidewire and catheter embolus

This risk is increased during difficult or multiple cannulation attempts of the same vessel, or the presence of an inferior vena cava filter 44. Preventative measures include minimising the length of guidewire advanced, and maintaining hold of the outside section. Guidewire counts or mandatory witnessed documentation of guidewire removal may help identify unaccounted wires during insertion. Retained guidewires are usually asymptomatic and recognised incidentally on X‐ray. Guidewire retention is now categorised as an NHS Never Event 45.

Catheter embolism occurs more often with long‐term devices. Catheter and port hub connections may fracture/disconnect. Compression of the catheter between the first rib and clavicle may result in 'pinch‐off' 46. Catheters are at risk during removal, especially cuffed/implanted devices.

Both complications need referral for urgent radiological or surgical retrieval.

Catheter occlusion

Occlusion may be due to thrombus, fibrin sheath or precipitation within the catheter. The incidence of catheter occlusion may be reduced by adhering to standard procedures for accessing CVCs and managing failing lines. A Cochrane review of heparin solutions reported no reduction in intracatheter thrombus 47. Occlusion is recognised by inability to aspirate or flush one or more catheter lumens. It is common, and often managed by a local protocol. A 'linogram' may identify a kinked catheter, aberrant tip position or a fibrin sheath with reflux of contrast. Thrombolytics can be used to clear the lumen or surrounding thrombus 48. In the case of precipitants, strong acid or alkali has been used to unblock devices.

### Comparative evaluation of the clinical safety and efficiency of supraclavicular and infraclavicular approaches for subclavian venous catheterization in adults: a meta-analysis [^1b24556a]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In this meta-analysis, we investigated the success rate of subclavian venous catheterization (SVC) as well as the incidence of related complications when performed via the supraclavicular (SC) or traditional infraclavicular (IC) approaches.

Methods

Ignoring the original language, we identified and analyzed eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published on or before December 30, 2018, after searching the following five bibliographic databases: PubMed, Springer, Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. All included studies compared the clinical safety and efficiency of the SC and IC approaches for SVC in adults. The Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias Tool was used to evaluate the methodological quality of each RCT. Cannulation failure rates and the incidence of malposition were regarded as the primary outcome measures. Secondary outcome measures included cannulation access time and the incidence of pneumothorax and artery puncture.

Results

Failure rates were significantly lower for SVC via the SC approach than via the IC approach [odds ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.47 to 0.93]. The SC approach was also associated with a decreased incidence of catheter malposition, relative to that observed for the IC approach [odds ratio, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.46]. The SC approach did not reduce the time required for cannulation [mean difference, -74.74; 95% CI, -157.80 to 8.33], and there were no differences in the incidence of artery puncture [odds ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.29 to 1.23] or pneumothorax [odds ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.33 to 2.40].

Conclusion

Our findings suggest that SVC via the SC approach should be utilized in adults.

### Comparison of ultrasound guided supraclavicular subclavian vein versus infraclavicular subclavian / axillary vein catheterization: a systematic review and meta analysis [^27e5ecb0]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Subclavian vein cannulation is an important technique of central venous cannulation with a supraclavicular and an infraclavicular approach. There are randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which highlight the various differences between these two approaches when accessed via ultrasound. We undertook a meta-analysis to compare the ultrasound guided supraclavicular subclavian and the infraclavicular subclavian/axillary vein cannulation, keeping in mind that the infraclavicular approach may lead to cannulation of either subclavian/axillary vein.

Methods

This meta-analysis encompassed studies that compared ultrasound-guided supraclavicular subclavian vein and infraclavicular subclavian/axillary vein. Binary outcomes were presented as odds ratios (OR), while continuous outcomes were presented as standardized mean differences (SMD) accompanied by 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Potential trials meeting the eligibility criteria were sought from databases including PubMed, PubMed Central, The Cochrane Library, and EMBASE, covering the period from inception to April 30, 2023.

Results

The analysis comprised a total of six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and one retrospective observational study collectively involving 1812 patients. The first pass success rate for subclavian vein catheterization was found to be greater with the supraclavicular approach (OR = 1.91 [95% CI 1.04–3.50]; p = 0.0002; I² = 77%). Moreover, the supraclavicular approach exhibited a significantly shorter catheterization time compared to the infraclavicular approach (SMD = -0.26 [95% CI -0.54 to 0.03]; p = 0.003; I² = 73%). Notably, there was no substantial disparity in complication rates between the two approaches (OR = 0.66 [95% CI 0.35–1.24]; p = 0.20; I² = 0%).

Conclusion

Ultrasound-guided supraclavicular approach for subclavian vein catheterization is superior to the infraclavicular approach for subclavian/axillary vein catheterization, with higher first-pass success rates, shorter catheterization times. However, there were no differences in the complication rates.

### 2012 EHRA / HRS expert consensus statement on cardiac resynchronization therapy in heart failure: implant and follow-up recommendations and management [^120ac730]. Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Lead implant sequence and access in CRT — For CRT‑defibrillator (CRT‑D) systems, the left chest is generally preferred because the left‑sided approach follows a relatively continuous course from subclavian vein to the coronary sinus (CS), whereas the right side presents two opposing angulations entering the superior vena cava and then the CS, and the defibrillation threshold is generally lower with a left‑sided generator; if venous access is needed for three leads, the cephalic vein as a single port can hinder manipulation, so the left ventricular (LV) lead is generally implanted via the subclavian vein and preferably by axillary venous puncture to minimize pneumothorax, with all three leads often placed via axillary or subclavian veins. The right ventricular (RV) lead should be positioned first because most CRT patients have left bundle branch block and CS cannulation trauma to the right bundle can cause complete heart block with urgent need for RV pacing; an LV lead may be displaced during RV positioning while the converse is rare, and a right atrial (RA) lead is usually implanted in sinus rhythm or when conversion from atrial fibrillation is possible, noting that even persistent atrial fibrillation patients may cardiovert during DFT testing or with haemodynamic improvement after CRT.

### Recommendations on the use of ultrasound guidance for central and peripheral vascular access in adults: a position statement of the Society of Hospital Medicine [^fb910994]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Preprocedure

1)We recommend that providers should be familiar with the operation of their specific ultrasound machine prior to initiation of a vascular access procedure. 2)We recommend that providers should use a high-frequency linear transducer with a sterile sheath and sterile gel to perform vascular access procedures. 3)We recommend that providers should use two-dimensional ultrasound to evaluate for anatomical variations and absence of vascular thrombosis during preprocedural site selection. 4)We recommend that providers should evaluate the target blood vessel size and depth during preprocedural ultrasound evaluation.

Techniques

General Techniques 5) We recommend that providers should avoid using static ultrasound alone to mark the needle insertion site for vascular access procedures. 6)We recommend that providers should use real-time (dynamic), two-dimensional ultrasound guidance with a high-frequency linear transducer for central venous catheter (CVC) insertion, regardless of the provider's level of experience. 7)We suggest using either a transverse (short-axis) or longitudinal (long-axis) approach when performing real-time ultrasound-guided vascular access procedures. 8)We recommend that providers should visualize the needle tip and guidewire in the target vein prior to vessel dilatation. 9)To increase the success rate of ultrasound-guided vascular access procedures, we recommend that providers should utilize echogenic needles, plastic needle guides, and/or ultrasound beam steering when available. Central Venous Access Techniques 10) We recommend that providers should use a standardized procedure checklist that includes the use of real-time ultrasound guidance to reduce the risk of central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) from CVC insertion. 11)We recommend that providers should use real-time ultrasound guidance, combined with aseptic technique and maximal sterile barrier precautions, to reduce the incidence of infectious complications from CVC insertion. 12)We recommend that providers should use real-time ultrasound guidance for internal jugular vein catheterization, which reduces the risk of mechanical and infectious complications, the number of needle passes, and time to cannulation and increases overall procedure success rates. 13)We recommend that providers who routinely insert subclavian vein CVCs should use real-time ultrasound guidance, which has been shown to reduce the risk of mechanical complications and number of needle passes and increase overall procedure success rates compared with landmark-based techniques. 14)We recommend that providers should use real-time ultrasound guidance for femoral venous access, which has been shown to reduce the risk of arterial punctures and total procedure time and increase overall procedure success rates. Peripheral Venous Access Techniques 15) We recommend that providers should use real-time ultrasound guidance for the insertion of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs), which is associated with higher procedure success rates and may be more cost effective compared with landmark-based techniques. 16)We recommend that providers should use real-time ultrasound guidance for the placement of peripheral intravenous lines (PIV) in patients with difficult peripheral venous access to reduce the total procedure time, needle insertion attempts, and needle redirections. Ultrasound-guided PIV insertion is also an effective alternative to CVC insertion in patients with difficult venous access. 17)We suggest using real-time ultrasound guidance to reduce the risk of vascular, infectious, and neurological complications during PIV insertion, particularly in patients with difficult venous access. Arterial Access Techniques 18)We recommend that providers should use real-time ultrasound guidance for arterial access, which has been shown to increase first-pass success rates, reduce the time to cannulation, and reduce the risk of hematoma development compared with landmark-based techniques. 19)We recommend that providers should use real-time ultrasound guidance for femoral arterial access, which has been shown to increase first-pass success rates and reduce the risk of vascular complications. 20)We recommend that providers should use real-time ultrasound guidance for radial arterial access, which has been shown to increase first-pass success rates, reduce the time to successful cannulation, and reduce the risk of complications compared with landmark-based techniques.

Postprocedure

21) We recommend that post-procedure pneumothorax should be ruled out by the detection of bilateral lung sliding using a high-frequency linear transducer before and after insertion of internal jugular and subclavian vein CVCs. 22)We recommend that providers should use ultrasound with rapid infusion of agitated saline to visualize a right atrial swirl sign (RASS) for detecting catheter tip misplacement during CVC insertion. The use of RASS to detect the catheter tip may be considered an advanced skill that requires specific training and expertise.

Training

23) To reduce the risk of mechanical and infectious complications, we recommend that novice providers should complete a systematic training program that includes a combination of simulation-based practice, supervised insertion on patients, and evaluation by an expert operator before attempting ultrasound-guided CVC insertion independently on patients. 24)We recommend that cognitive training in ultrasound-guided CVC insertion should include basic anatomy, ultrasound physics, ultrasound machine knobology, fundamentals of image acquisition and interpretation, detection and management of procedural complications, infection prevention strategies, and pathways to attain competency. 25)We recommend that trainees should demonstrate minimal competence before placing ultrasound-guided CVCs independently. A minimum number of CVC insertions may inform this determination, but a proctored assessment of competence is most important. 26)We recommend that didactic and hands-on training for trainees should coincide with anticipated times of increased performance of vascular access procedures. Refresher training sessions should be offered periodically. 27)We recommend that competency assessments should include formal evaluation of knowledge and technical skills using standardized assessment tools. 28)We recommend that competency assessments should evaluate for proficiency in the following knowledge and skills of CVC insertion: (a) Knowledge of the target vein anatomy, proper vessel identification, and recognition of anatomical variants; (b) Demonstration of CVC insertion with no technical errors based on a procedural checklist; (c) Recognition and management of acute complications, including emergency management of life-threatening complications; (d) Real-time needle tip tracking with ultrasound and cannulation on the first attempt in at least five consecutive simulation. 29)We recommend a periodic proficiency assessment of all operators should be conducted to ensure maintenance of competency.

### How long should peripherally inserted central catheterization be delayed in the context of recently documented bloodstream infection? [^d8f08ce0]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

The risk of relapsing bacteremia was assessed retrospectively among a cohort of 348 patients who underwent peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) insertion within 6 weeks of a documented bacteremia. The overall risk of relapsing bacteremia was low (three of 348; 0.9%) when PICC insertion was performed in the context of a recent bloodstream infection. The relapse risk was higher when PICCs were inserted within 2 days (two of 31; 6.5%) versus at least 3 days (one of 317; 0.3%) after documentation of bacteremia (P = 0.02).

### Efficacy of an implementation package on documentation of central venous catheter insertions: an observational study [^c0d941c3]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Results

During the study period, a total of 7769 CVC insertion templates were reviewed (figure 1). Of these 5539 (78%) were complete and 22% contained one or more missing fields (table 2). The most common missing field was 'Catheter model / LOT' (11%) and the most uncommon field with missing data was 'Insertion time' (2.3%). Only one field was missing in 852 cases which was 54% of all templates with missing data (n = 1587). In 28% of the cases where data were missing in only one field, 'Catheter model / LOT' was liable (table 2). Between the first and second quarter there was a significant increase in the proportion of completed templates (72 vs 83%, p < 0.0001). From the second to the last quarter the proportion of completed templates stabilized around 80% (table 3).

Fifty-three out of the 317 CVC inserting physicians (17%) had more than one term of missing data per central line insertion template. Completeness of documentation of CVC insertions increased from 38% in the historical controlto 93% in the present study (table 4). This represents an absolute reduction for missing data of 55% (95% CI 53% to 56%) after the implementation package as compared with before (p < 0.001).

### AIUM practice parameter for the use of ultrasound to guide vascular access procedures [^606e2d5b]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Subclavian/axillary vein ultrasound guidance — There are 3 basic approaches to the subclavian vein: infraclavicular (proximal) approach, axillary vein (more distal infraclavicular) approach, and supraclavicular approach. Visualization of the subclavian vein from an infraclavicular approach using dynamic ultrasound may be difficult, but ultrasound may aid in safely cannulating the subclavian or proximal axillary veins, and this can be aided by using a smaller-footprint transducer (including an L-shaped "hockey stick" transducer or a high-frequency endocavity transducer), but linear array (7–12-MHz) transducers usually will suffice. Before the procedure, the clavicle, pleural line, vein, and artery should be clearly identified and excessive pressure should be avoided to prevent collapsing the vein. When approaching the subclavian vein, the short-axis, out-of-plane view is safer than the long-axis, in-plane view, and the vein and artery should be clearly visualized as separate structures just below the distal half of the clavicle on a short-axis view. Ultrasound may be used to aid correct guide wire placement and avoid migration of the guide wire or catheter into the ipsilateral IJ vein. In the axillary vein approach, the vein can be differentiated from the artery by compression, although more force may be required to collapse the vein than usual because of soft tissue and overlying muscle in the chest; in conscious (awake) patients, performing a "sniff test" while resting the ultrasound transducer over the subclavian/axillary vein helps identify a vein versus an artery, and Doppler imaging may be helpful in identifying the artery. The proximity of the pleura should be appreciated, as well as the risk of pneumothorax, and ultrasound may be used after the procedure to assess for the presence of pneumothorax. With ultrasound guidance, the large venous target resulting from the confluence of the IJ and subclavian veins can be appreciated, and ultrasound guidance for this approach should use an in-plane, long-axis view to allow the transducer to fit into the supraclavicular space and to follow the trajectory of the needle.

### Bedside ultrasound to detect central venous catheter misplacement and associated iatrogenic complications: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^619b9c32]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

According to some ultrasound protocols two operators are required to insert the CVC and control its position at the same time with US. However, this is only necessary if either agitated saline is used to flush the line or a per-procedural protocol is being performed that visualizes the advancement of the guidewire. In any other case, one physician can insert the CVC and afterwards perform an ultrasonographic examination of the contralateral internal jugular vein, both subclavian veins, and the right atrium via the subcostal view. We suggest this information to be added to the protocol for US-guided CVC placement, recently published by Saugel and coworkers. We refer to Additional file 6 for a detailed description of all protocols and the number of operators needed.

Intra-atrial misplacement was more readily detected compared to extra-atrial misplacement. One possible explanation might be the fact that not all possible locations of extra-atrial malposition are detectable by US whereas the right atrium and ventricle are often easily scanned by TTE. This would cause more false negatives to occur in the extra-atrial misplacement group and would therefore lead to a lower sensitivity.

### Guidelines for the prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections: recommendations relevant to interventional radiology for venous catheter placement and maintenance [^26f00aa5]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Catheter and site selection — use midline catheter or peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) instead of short peripheral catheter when the duration of intravenous therapy will likely exceed 6 d (category II). Use fistula or graft in patients with chronic renal failure instead of central venous catheter (CVC) for permanent access for dialysis. Use CVC with the minimum number of ports or lumens essential for management of patient (category IB). No recommendation can be made regarding the use of a designated lumen for parenteral nutrition (unresolved issue). Promptly remove any intravascular catheter that is no longer essential (category IA). Weigh the risks and benefits of placing a central venous device at recommended site to reduce infectious complications against risk for mechanical complications (eg, pneumothorax, subclavian artery puncture, subclavian vein laceration, subclavian vein stenosis, hemothorax, thrombosis, air embolism, and catheter misplacement) (category IA). Avoid using femoral vein for central venous access in adult patients. Use a subclavian site, rather than jugular or femoral site, in adult patients to minimize infection risk for nontunneled CVC placement (category IB). Avoid subclavian site in hemodialysis patients and patients with advanced kidney disease to avoid subclavian vein stenosis (category IA). Use chlorhexidine/silver sulfadiazine or minocycline/rifampin-impregnated CVC in patients whose catheter is expected to remain in place > 5 d, if, after successful implementation of a comprehensive strategy to reduce rates of central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), the CLABSI rate is not decreasing; comprehensive strategy should include at least the following three components: educating persons who insert and maintain catheters, use of maximum sterile barrier (MSB) precautions, and > 0.5% chlorhexidine preparation with alcohol for skin antisepsis during CVC insertion (category IA).

### An alternative central venous route for cardiac surgery: supraclavicular subclavian vein catheterization [^cb1895f8]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the clinical success rate, safety, and usefulness for intraoperative central venous pressure monitoring, and the intravenous access of the supraclavicular subclavian vein approach when compared with the infraclavicular subclavian vein approach and the internal jugular vein approach for central venous catheterization during open-chest cardiac surgery.

Design

A prospective, randomized, single-center study.

Setting

A university hospital.

Participants

One hundred ninety-five patients scheduled for open-chest cardiac surgery.

Interventions

The study population consisted of patients for whom central vein catheterization was intended during cardiac surgery. Patients were randomized to 3 groups according to the route of central vein catheterization: the supraclavicular group: the supraclavicular approach for the subclavian vein (n = 65); the infraclavicular group: the infraclavicular approach for the subclavian vein (n = 65); and the jugular group: the internal jugular vein approach (n = 65). After the induction of anesthesia, central venous catheterization was performed according to the assigned approach.

Measurements and Main Results

The success rates for the assigned approach were 98%, 98%, and 92% for the supraclavicular, infraclavicular, and jugular groups, respectively (p > 0.05). The success rates in the first 3 attempts in patients who were catheterized successfully according to the assigned approach were 96%, 100%, and 96% for the supraclavicular, infraclavicular, and jugular groups, respectively (p > 0.05). There was no difference among groups in catheter insertion time (p > 0.05). After sternal retraction, central venous pressure trace loss and difficulty in fluid infusion were significantly more frequent in the infraclavicular group (21%) when compared with the supraclavicular (3%) and jugular groups (0%) (p = 0.01). There was no difference among groups in terms of catheter malposition, complications during catheterization, and rate of catheter-related infection.

Conclusion

The supraclavicular approach for subclavian vein catheterization is an acceptable alternative for central venous access during cardiac surgery in terms of procedural success rate, ease of placement, rate of complications, and usability after sternal retractor expansion.

### Reliability and compliance of peripheral intravenous catheter documentation: a prospective observational study [^437c507e]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Proper documentation of the functionality and complications of peripheral intravenous catheters (PIVC) is the standard of care. This data can improve communication among team members about access concerns and highlight opportunities to improve PIVC care. Our objective is to determine if nursing personnel are compliant with institutional standards for documentation and documentation is reliable.

Methods

This prospective observational analysis was conducted at a tertiary care academic center with 120,000 ED visits and 1100 hospital beds. Adults over 18 with a PIVC placed in the ED via palpation technique who were being admitted to regular medical/surgical wards were eligible. The primary outcome was compliance with PIVC documentation per institutional standards. Secondary outcomes included compliance subcategorized as insertion, daily assessment, and removal and reliability of assessments.

Results

During July and August 2020, 77 patients were enrolled with a total of 1201 observations of PIVC compliance. PIVC documentation compliance was 86.0% (1033/1201). Compliance on insertion and removal was 93.3% (431/462) and 80.5% (186/231), respectively, with removal assessment being the least compliant at 49.4%. Daily catheter assessments were compliant 81.9% (416/508) of the time. PIVC documentation reliability was based on 693 total observations with 87.9% (609/693) reliability overall, and a reliability of 91.6% (423/462) and 74.9% (173/231) for insertion and removal, respectively. PIVC orientation had the highest reliability (98.7%) while post-removal assessment had the lowest reliability (45.5%).

Conclusions

We observed moderate documentation compliance and reliability for PIVC assessments for catheters placed in the ED. Documentation of removal-related variables was the most deficient aspect of the assessments. Given the high rate of PIVC failure and its vast array of consequences, improvement of PIVC documentation of removal reasons is essential to better identify type and incidence of complications and help develop targeted solutions. Further larger studies are needed to survey PIVC documentation practices.

### Did the use of the guideliner V2 (TM) guide catheter extension increase complications? A review of the incidence of complications related to the use of the V2 catheter, the influence of right brachiocephalic arterial anatomy and the redesign of the V3 (TM) guideliner and clinical outcomes [^b1b254a1]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Description of subclavian artery anatomy

A total of 46 patients were included for this analysis. The mean age was 65 (± 11.5) and 30 (66%) were male. Mean height was 168 cm (± 9); with a mean weight of 84 kg (± 19) and body mass index of 29.6 (± 5.7). Examples of where the measurements were taken are demonstrated in figure 2. The mean distance from the tip of the measuring catheter to the inferior border of clavicular heads was 109 (± 19) mm. The mean distance to the most superior segment of the clavicle was 137 (± 18) mm. Finally, the mean distance to the most posterior border of the clavicle was 193 (± 19) mm.

### Practice guidelines for central venous access 2020: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on central venous access [^03070049]. Anesthesiology (2020). High credibility.

Practice guidelines for central venous access — catheter maintenance directives include: Determine the duration of catheterization based on clinical need. Assess the clinical need for keeping the catheter in place on a daily basis. Remove catheters promptly when no longer deemed clinically necessary. Inspect the catheter insertion site daily for signs of infection. Change or remove the catheter when catheter insertion site infection is suspected. When a catheter-related infection is suspected, a new insertion site may be used for catheter replacement rather than changing the catheter over a guidewire.
