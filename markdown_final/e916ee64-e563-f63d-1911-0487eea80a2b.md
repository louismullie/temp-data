## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking at which eGFR threshold metformin should be discontinued in patients with chronic kidney disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative, current guidelines and regulatory labeling. Then, I should verify how these recommendations differ from older creatinine-based contraindications. Next, I will review the safety evidence that underpins the eGFR thresholds. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically actionable answer and confirm any nuances around initiation versus continuation and dose adjustment.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory anchor point. The FDA's current labeling explicitly states that metformin is contraindicated when eGFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², and it advises against initiation when eGFR is 30–45 mL/min/1.73 m², with reassessment of benefits and risks if eGFR later falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m² while on therapy [^113r4B4w] [^111UnmKt].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline convergence. KDIGO 2022 recommends initiating metformin in patients with T2DM and CKD when eGFR is at least 30 mL/min/1.73 m², and to adjust the dose when eGFR is below 45 mL/min/1.73 m², aligning with the FDA's discontinuation threshold at eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^115FWSN9] [^116CCts7]. The ADA Standards of Care 2025 similarly supports use down to eGFR 30 mL/min/1.73 m² with dose reduction in the 30–45 range and discontinuation below 30, reinforcing the same cut points [^111eEWJ3] [^116YAZC1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the safety evidence that justifies these thresholds. A high-quality JAMA review found no increased lactic acidosis risk in mild to moderate CKD (eGFR 30–60) and supports cautious expansion of metformin use with appropriate monitoring, while a systematic review and meta-analysis showed increased acidosis risk only when eGFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m², which aligns with the < 30 discontinuation threshold [^116r18zE] [^116r18zE]. Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies also show that metformin levels remain within therapeutic ranges down to eGFR 30, with accumulation and risk rising below that level, supporting the 30 mL/min/1.73 m² cutoff [^111F2LmG] [^113MFXxS].

> I need to check the older creatinine-based rules to ensure I'm not conflating them with current practice. Historically, U.S. labeling used serum creatinine cutoffs (≥ 1.5 mg/dL in men, ≥ 1.4 mg/dL in women) that often underestimated renal impairment, especially in women, older adults, and those with low muscle mass; the modern approach explicitly replaces creatinine with eGFR for decision-making, which is more accurate and equitable across populations [^113r4B4w] [^114HGpJL].

> Let me consider the practical dose and monitoring steps so I don't oversimplify. For eGFR 45–59 mL/min/1.73 m², many guidelines advise considering dose reduction and increasing eGFR monitoring frequency; for eGFR 30–44 mL/min/1.73 m², dose reduction to about half the typical maximum and closer monitoring are recommended; for eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m², metformin should be discontinued and not initiated, with attention to temporary holds during acute illness, contrast procedures, or surgery per contemporary guidance [^111eEWJ3] [^116WMp3j] [^113UCNV4].

> But wait, what if someone argues for a more conservative threshold like 45 or 60 mL/min/1.73 m²? Some expert opinions and older or more cautious guidance have suggested avoiding initiation below 45 or even limiting use above 60 in certain high-risk contexts; however, the weight of current regulatory and guideline consensus supports use down to 30 with dose adjustment and monitoring, reserving discontinuation for eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m², which balances benefit and risk most consistently across populations [^113r4B4w] [^115FWSN9] [^111eEWJ3].

> Final answer: Metformin should be discontinued when eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², so the correct choice is d. GFR < 30 ml/min [^113r4B4w] [^115FWSN9] [^111eEWJ3].

---

The correct answer is **d. GFR < 30 ml/min**. Metformin should be discontinued when **eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m²** because of the increased risk of lactic acidosis from drug accumulation [^113r4B4w] [^113Rx3fT]. For eGFR 30–45 mL/min/1.73 m², use the lowest effective dose and monitor renal function closely; for eGFR ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m², no routine dose adjustment is needed, though monitoring is still advised [^111eEWJ3] [^116WMp3j].

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Several authoritative organizations provide clear guidance on metformin use in CKD:

| **Organization** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| FDA | - Contraindicated if eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^113r4B4w] <br/> - Do not initiate if eGFR 30–45 mL/min/1.73 m² [^111UnmKt] <br/> - Reassess if eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m² on therapy [^111eEWJ3] |
| KDIGO | - Initiate if eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^115FWSN9] <br/> - Adjust dose if eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m² [^116CCts7] <br/> - Discontinue if eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^116KB1gH] |
| ADA | - Safe to use if eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^111eEWJ3] <br/> - Reassess if eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m² [^116YAZC1] <br/> - Discontinue if eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^111eEWJ3] |
| AACE | - Contraindicated if eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^114CVt1N] <br/> - Do not initiate if eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m² [^1179HMBx] <br/> - Reduce dose if eGFR 30–45 mL/min/1.73 m² [^114CVt1N] |

## Rationale for discontinuation at eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²

Metformin is renally cleared; as kidney function declines, drug accumulation increases the risk of **metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA)** [^113Rx3fT]. Although MALA is rare overall, the risk rises significantly when eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^116r18zE]. This threshold balances the drug's benefits with the potential for serious adverse effects in advanced CKD.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the 30 mL/min/1.73 m² threshold

Multiple studies and reviews support the **< 30 mL/min/1.73 m²** cutoff:

- A systematic review found no increased lactic acidosis risk with eGFR ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m², possible risk at 30–44, and a clear increase when eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^116r18zE].
- Observational data show metformin is safe and may reduce mortality down to eGFR 30 mL/min/1.73 m², but benefits wane and risks rise below this level [^116r18zE].
- Pharmacokinetic studies show metformin accumulation increases as eGFR declines, especially below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^111F2LmG].

---

## Clinical implications of discontinuation

Discontinuing metformin at eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² may worsen glycemic control, so clinicians should consider **alternative therapies** such as insulin, GLP-1 receptor agonists, or SGLT2 inhibitors (if eGFR allows) [^112VEpub]. Close monitoring and individualized planning are essential to maintain glycemic targets and reduce hypoglycemia risk.

---

## Special considerations and exceptions

- **Temporary discontinuation**: Hold metformin during acute illness, dehydration, or before iodinated contrast if eGFR is 30–60 mL/min/1.73 m², and restart only after renal function stabilizes [^111eEWJ3] [^111HeQL8].
- **Individualized decisions**: In select cases with stable eGFR 25–30 mL/min/1.73 m², some guidelines allow cautious use at low dose with close monitoring, but this remains controversial and off-label in many regions [^114rULsB] [^117AKUdn].
- **Dialysis**: Metformin is generally contraindicated in dialysis due to negligible clearance and high accumulation risk.

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **eGFR ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m²**: No routine dose adjustment; monitor renal function at least annually [^111eEWJ3].
- **eGFR 30–44 mL/min/1.73 m²**: Use lowest effective dose, monitor renal function every 3–6 months, and reassess benefits/risks [^111eEWJ3] [^116WMp3j].
- **eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²**: Discontinue metformin and consider alternative therapies [^113r4B4w] [^115FWSN9].

---

The correct answer is **d. GFR < 30 ml/min**. Metformin should be discontinued when **eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m²** due to lactic acidosis risk, with dose adjustment and closer monitoring at 30–45 mL/min/1.73 m² [^113r4B4w] [^111eEWJ3].

CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES

The prescribing information for metformin in the current label is explicit with respect to renal contraindications, based on serum creatinine cut points. It proscribes use at or above the 1.4 and 1.5 mg/dL levels in women and men, respectively. The recently updated Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines from the National Kidney Foundation are perfectly consistent with the label. Yet, certain U.S. practice guidelines substantially differ in their recommendations for metformin use related to renal status. The annually updated clinical practice guidelines issued by the American Diabetes Association, for example, do not actually discuss renal thresholds but refer the reader to a separate consensus statement for prescribing details. This statement, authored by members of the American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes, reports that metformin seems safe unless eGFR falls to < 30 mL/min per 1.73 m².

Clinical guidelines outside of the U.S. incorporate the eGFR for determination of metformin safety. In the U.K. for example, prescribing guidelines consider both creatinine and eGFR for assessing treatment eligibility. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommends reviewing the clinical circumstances when serum creatinine exceeds 130 µmol/L (1.5 mg/dL) or eGFR falls below 45 mL/min per 1.73 m 2. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence further specifies that metformin be stopped if serum creatinine exceeds 150 µmol/L (1.7 mg/dL) (a higher threshold than in the U.S.) or eGFR is below 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2. In contrast, the Canadian Diabetes Association practice guidelines are now based solely on eGFR, recommending caution with eGFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 and contraindicating its use with eGFR < 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2. The Australian Diabetes Society practice guidelines similarly recommend against metformin with eGFR < 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 and caution with eGFR 30–45 mL/min per 1.73 m 2. Thus, although there is clear recognition that renal failure may be a risk factor for adverse events with metformin use, there is significant divergence in opinion across the globe regarding the optimal definition of safety.

### Use of metformin in the setting of mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency [^1152ER3S]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

A common clinical conundrum faces all U.S. practitioners treating patients with type 2 diabetes. Today's U.S. Food and Drug Administration prescribing guidelines for metformin contraindicate its use in men and women with serum creatinine concentrations ≥ 1.5 and ≥ 1.4 mg/dL (≥ 132 and ≥ 123 µmol/L), respectively. In a patient tolerating and controlled with this medication, should it automatically be discontinued as the creatinine rises beyond these cut points over time? Stopping metformin often results in poorly controlled glycemia and/or the need for other agents with their own adverse-effect profiles. Moreover, is the now widespread use of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in lieu of serum creatinine levels creating even more confusion, especially in those with abnormalities in one but not the other indirect measure of renal function? Indeed, more than a decade and a half after metformin became available in the U.S. debate continues over the best approach in these settings. How many patients are unable to receive this medication on the basis of guidelines which, although well intentioned, are somewhat arbitrary and outdated based on modern assessments of renal status?

Table 1
Proposed recommendations for use of metformin based on eGFR

Without question, such a treatment program could not be implemented without meticulous clinical follow-up, clear communication with patients regarding risks and benefits of therapy, and adherence to frequent monitoring. The plan, therefore, should be modified in patients with suboptimal adherence to medical instructions or regular follow-up. It is clear that vigilance would be required so that cases of lactic acidosis do not emerge because of inappropriate use of metformin in patients with more advanced and/or unstable CKD.

Given the frequency with which clinicians must decide whether to continue or initiate metformin in mild-to-moderate CKD, these recommendations would have a profound impact on clinical practice. Such proposals, being consistent with the sentiments of several well-respected national guideline committees, should be reviewed by professional medical organizations in the U.S. such as the American Diabetes Association. If a consensus emerges, perhaps the Food and Drug Administration might reconsider the current metformin-prescribing guidelines, which, like those of other nonbranded compounds, tend to remain static despite emerging evidence and changes in clinical care.

In the future, more research in this important area is needed, including prospective, randomized trials of metformin at varying degrees of renal impairment and/or closer examination of registries of CKD patients receiving metformin.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Although metformin is eliminated renally, and accumulation may conceivably lead to lactic acidosis, there currently is limited systematic evidence to substantiate continued reliance on the creatinine-based contraindications in use in the U.S. Indeed, in the modern era of eGFR, this measure of glomerular filtration appears to give a more reliable estimate of renal dysfunction. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is exceedingly rare based on the available literature, and even though the use of metformin has not been comprehensively assessed in individuals with CKD, there is extensive evidence that this agent often is used without adverse effects in those with mildly to moderately reduced renal function. In the context of rising concerns regarding other glucose-lowering therapies, safety restrictions over the use of metformin in this population may result in the drug being stopped prematurely and unnecessarily in some patients. This may lead to significant deterioration in glycemic control and/or the need for other glucose-lowering medications, which present their own safety concerns. An evidence-based approach to prescribing metformin in this group appears warranted, taking into account the current pervasive use of eGFR in clinical care.

We therefore suggest that the current guidelines for metformin use in the U.S. be updated. These recommendations should include eGFR thresholds that are generally consistent with the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines in the U.K. and those endorsed by the Canadian Diabetes Association and the Australian Diabetes Society (Table 1). Metformin may be continued (or initiated) with eGFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2, but renal function should be monitored closely (every 3–6 months). The dose of metformin should be reviewed and reduced (e.g. by 50% or to half-maximal dose) in those with eGFR < 45 mL/min per 1.73 m 2, and renal function should be monitored closely (every 3 months). Metformin should not be initiated in patients at this stage, however. The drug should be stopped once eGFR falls to < 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2. Additional caution is required in patients with anticipated significant fluctuations in renal status or those at risk for abrupt deterioration in kidney function, based on previous history, other comorbidities, albuminuria, and medication regimen (e.g. potent diuretics or nephrotoxic agents).

### Chronic kidney disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111eEWJ3]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease in diabetes — metformin use and monitoring thresholds are specified using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR): medication dosing may require modification with eGFR < 60 mL/min/ 1.73 m2, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance recommends using eGFR instead of serum creatinine. The FDA states that metformin is contraindicated with an eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, eGFR should be monitored while taking metformin, benefits and risks should be reassessed when eGFR falls to < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, metformin should not be initiated if eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, and it should be temporarily discontinued at the time of or before iodinated contrast imaging when eGFR is 30–60 mL/min/1.73 m2.

### Introducing estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) into clinical practice in the UK: implications for the use of metformin [^115B5jAq]. Diabetic Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

The reporting of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) will identify people with diabetes who have previously undiagnosed renal impairment. Our current guideline recommends discontinuation of metformin when serum creatinine > 150 micromol/l. We examined the implications of replacing this with a criterion based on eGFR.

Methods

The Lothian diabetes register was used to identify patients with Type 2 diabetes for whom age, sex and creatinine measurements within the last 15 months were available. eGFR was calculated using the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation.

Results

Of 19,981 patients with Type 2 diabetes, 11,297 were taking metformin in accordance with our current guideline. Of these, 9259 (82.0%) had at least stage 2 renal impairment (eGFR < 90 ml/min per 1.73 m²) and 2880 (25.5%) had at least stage 3 renal impairment (eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)). Changing to an eGFR threshold of 36 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) would have a neutral effect on the number of patients eligible for metformin therapy and would permit its use in patients with creatinine concentrations as high as 179 micromol/l. An eGFR threshold of 40 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) would result in 312 (2.8%) patients discontinuing metformin and would permit metformin to be used with creatinine concentrations as high as 163 micromol/l.

Conclusions

The introduction of eGFR reporting could have a major effect on prescription of metformin. A threshold eGFR of 36–40 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) is approximately consistent with our current practice. If our current practice is considered safe, this would be a useful recommendation.

Example treatment recommendation — metformin for type 2 diabetes (T2D) with chronic kidney disease (CKD): We recommend treating patients with T2D, CKD, and an eGFR ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m^2 with metformin (1B). Considerations for implementation: dose adjustments are required, no safety data for patients with eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m^2, and must be discontinued when this level is reached.

### Use of metformin in the setting of mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency [^111sEUs6]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Despite these appropriate concerns, most of the available data would suggest that, on average, eGFR declines slowly in diabetes, although it can be accelerated to some degree in the presence of albuminuria. If eGFR is calculated annually (and more frequently in those at high risk for deterioration in renal function), it is unlikely that patients will experience changes in their eGFR levels large enough to rapidly alter the safety of metformin therapy.

Older adults with type 2 diabetes — metformin use, renal thresholds, monitoring, and tolerability are outlined: Metformin may be used safely in some people with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, and lower doses may be used in those with an eGFR 30–45 mL/min/1.73 m2, with eGFR monitored every 3 to 6 months in those at risk for decline in kidney function; it is contraindicated in advanced renal insufficiency and should be used with caution in hypoperfusion, hypoxemia, impaired hepatic function, or heart failure due to lactic acidosis risk; metformin may be temporarily discontinued before iodinated-contrast procedures, during hospitalizations, and when acute illness may compromise renal or liver function; the daily dose should be slowly increased to minimize gastrointestinal side effects, reduction or elimination may be needed for persistent gastrointestinal side effects, and monitoring for vitamin B12 deficiency should be considered for long-term use; an extended-release formulation may be used as an alternative to immediate-release in older adults with difficulties maintaining medication plans or with gastrointestinal effects.

Practice Point 2 — metformin-treated patients with chronic kidney disease — estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) monitoring and dose adjustment are specified as follows: "Monitor eGFR in patients treated with metformin. Increase the frequency of monitoring when eGFR is < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m^2". If "eGFR < 30", "Stop metformin; do not initiate metformin". For dose initiation at eGFR ≥ 60 or eGFR 45–59, immediate release may start with "Initial 500 mg or 850 mg once daily" and be "Titrate upwards by 500 mg/d or 850 mg/d every 7 days until maximum dose"; for gastrointestinal intolerance, extended release uses "Initial 500 mg daily" and "Titrate upwards by 500 mg/d every 7 days until maximum dose". For eGFR 30–44, "Initiate at half the dose and titrate upwards to half of maximum recommended dose". Vitamin B12 monitoring is "Annually if on metformin for more than 4 years or at risk of vitamin B12 deficiency". Kidney function monitoring intervals are "At least annually" or "At least every 3–6 months" depending on eGFR category. For subsequent dose adjustment, at eGFR ≥ 60 "Continue same dose"; at eGFR 45–59 "Continue same dose. Consider dose reduction in certain conditions (see text)"; and at eGFR 30–44 "Half the dose". The figure notes rationale for the practice point, including "Limited evidence to support the guidance" and "No systematic review was conducted".

### Metformin: an old but still the best treatment for type 2 diabetes [^1125tAHL]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

Despite the use of metformin in cases where it is contraindicated, the incidence of lactic acidosis has not increased. Most patients with case reports relating metformin to lactic acidosis had at least one or more predisposing conditions for lactic acidosis.

Renal dysfunction is the most common risk factor associated with lactic acidosis but so far there is no clear evidence indicating at which level of renal dysfunction metformin should be discontinued or contraindicated in order to prevent lactic acidosis. Some authors have suggested discontinuing its use when serum creatinine is above 1.5 mg/dL in men and 1.4 mg/dL in women while others suggested a cut-off of 2.2 mg/dL and continuous use even in the case of ischaemic cardiopathy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or cardiac failure.

As serum creatinine can underestimate renal dysfunction, particularly in elderly patients and women, the use of estimated GFR (eGFR) has been advocated. The recommended eGFR thresholds are generally consistent with the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines in the U.K. and those endorsed by the Canadian Diabetes Association and the Australian Diabetes Society. Metformin may be continued or initiated with an eGFR of 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 but renal function should be monitored closely (every 3–6 months). The dose of metformin should be reviewed and reduced (e.g. by 50% or to half-maximal dose) in those with an eGFR of 45 mL/min per 1.73 m 2, and renal function should be monitored closely (every 3 months). Metformin should not be initiated in patients at this eGFR. The drug should be stopped once eGFR falls to 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2. Frid et al. supports these recommendations through findings that above 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 metformin levels rarely goes above 20 mmol/l, which seems to be a safe level.

Another clinical condition associated with lactic acidosis in patients using metformin is heart failure.

### Efficacy and safety of metformin in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in older adults: a systematic review for the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^111Z5MyX]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This study highlights the lack of good quality evidence on the risks and benefits of metformin for the management of DM2 in older people. The use of metformin seems associated with benefits to lower mortality risk in older people, and may also be associated with a reduced risk of adverse events such as hypoglycaemia and non-fatal cardiovascular events, than other antidiabetic drugs, especially sulfonylureas. However, no prospective studies focussing on very old (80 and older) and functionally and cognitively impaired older people are available. In very old people, those with renal insufficiency (GFR ≤ 60 ml/min) and those with gastrointestinal complaints during the last year, the discontinuation of metformin should be considered, especially for those with limited life expectancy or functional impairment. There is an urgent need for studies on the risks and benefits of metformin for the management of DM2 in these populations in order to guide clinicians in planning of individualised patient care.

Regarding preventative measures for contrast-induced nephropathy, more specifically with respect to discontinuation of medications, CAR 2022 guidelines recommend to hold metformin at the time of or before iodinated contrast media administration in patients with an eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or AKI. Do not restart metformin for at least 48 hours and only then if kidney function remains stable (< 25% increase compared with baseline creatinine) and the ongoing use of metformin has been re-assessed by the patient's clinical team.

Type 2 diabetes — metformin renal use parameters and monitoring: Metformin should not be used in persons with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and should not be initiated if eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2; however, once started it can continue in persons with stable eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, with reduction in total daily dose prudent when eGFR is between 30 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. Metformin is sometimes associated with anorexia and weight loss and may cause gastrointestinal adverse effects, and longer-term use may be associated with vitamin B12 deficiency for which B12 levels should be monitored periodically. When metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated, acceptable alternatives include GLP-1 RAs, SGLT2is, DPP-4 inhibitors, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors.

- Assess the benefit/risk of continuing therapy in patients initiated on metformin at higher eGFR rates. Consider initiating metformin at 500 mg once daily, then titrating to 500 mg twice daily if well-tolerated, while closely monitoring renal function. Consider maintaining treatment at a decreased dosage for ongoing management, and increasing up to a maximum of 500 mg twice daily with close monitoring of kidney function.

2.3 Metformin

Metformin is eliminated by the kidneys and has historically been considered unsuitable for use in patients with advanced CKD because of concerns about development of lactic acidosis attributed to metformin accumulation. 31, 32 These concerns were largely based on case reports, and observational studies have not shown the predicted increase in the risk of metformin‐associated lactic acidosis. 33 Consequently, changes to recommendations for metformin use occurred in 2016 when the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) relaxed its restrictions for metformin use in CKD following a review of the safety of this agent in patients with impairment of kidney function. 34 For patients with CKD, the guidance states that starting metformin in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30–45 mL/min/1.73m 2 is not recommended. For patients taking metformin whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73m 2, the benefits and risks of continuing treatment should be evaluated, and metformin should be discontinued in patients whose eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73m 2. 34

Recent evidence suggests that low‐dose metformin (500 mg once‐daily) may be used in patients with an eGFR of 15–30 mL/min/1.73m 2, provided the dosage is adjusted on an individual patient basis and that the drug is stopped during acute illness. 35, 36 However, the FDA has not approved metformin use in patients with an eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73m 2. 37

### Establishing pragmatic estimated GFR thresholds to guide metformin prescribing [^113B4EDu]. Diabetic Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

Renal impairment is a contraindication to metformin treatment because of the perceived increased risk of lactic acidosis. Current guidelines define renal impairment according to the serum creatinine of the individual, but this measure is being supplanted by the use of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as it gives a closer estimate to true GFR. This study aimed to establish pragmatic eGFR limits for use in patients being considered for metformin treatment.

Methods

Estimated GFR measurements corresponding to currently used metformin creatinine limits of 130 and 150 micromol/l were derived and then applied to 12 482 patients with diabetes in Hull and East Yorkshire.

Results

Few patients with a serum creatinine of 130 or 150 micromol/l have an eGFR of < 30 ml/min/1.73 m(2)[chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4 or greater], while most are between 30 and 59 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (CKD stage 3). When applied to the 12 482 patients (median age 67 years, interquartile range 56–75), males predominated when using creatinine cut-offs (13.6% of males and 8.3% of females had creatinine > 130 micromol/l; 8.2% males and 5.2% females > 150 micromol/l), but not using eGFR CKD thresholds (3.3% males and 4.7% females < 30 ml/min/1.73 m(2); 20.8% males and 28.1% females eGFR 30–59 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Similar proportions of patients as currently would have metformin withheld if using eGFR cut-offs between 30 and 49 ml/min/1.73 m(2).

Conclusions

We have proposed pragmatic eGFR limits to guide metformin prescribing in patients with renal impairment. CKD stage 4 or greater should be an absolute contraindication to metformin, while CKD stage 3 should alert clinicians to consider other risk factors before initiating or continuing treatment.

Health care professionals should follow the latest recommendations when prescribing metformin-containing medicines to patients with impaired kidney function. Patients should talk to their health care professionals if they have any questions or concerns about taking metformin. 3–6 We are requiring changes to the metformin labeling to reflect this new information and provide specific recommendations on the drug's use in patients with mild to moderate kidney impairment.

### Novel assay of metformin levels in patients with type 2 diabetes and varying levels of renal function: clinical recommendations [^113MFXxS]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

It is widely acknowledged that metformin therapy is beneficial in treating type 2 diabetes and should be made available to as many patients as possible. One obstacle to this has been the possible risk of lactic acidosis in patients with impaired renal function. We have had seven cases of patients on treatment with metformin admitted with lactic acidosis with metformin levels ranging from 256 to 682 μmol/l (median 330). These data suggest that high levels of serum metformin are needed to cause lactic acidosis.

Prevailing clinical experience has led to recommendations that metformin may be used at eGFR above 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2. Our study supports these guidelines showing that patients above this GFR limit rarely had metformin levels above 20 μmol/l, which seems to be a safe level.

If the current guidelines gain general recognition it becomes even more important to advocate cessation of metformin therapy when renal failure develops abruptly or in our opinion with any severe disease, especially when there is risk of dehydration.

Results from this study show a considerable intra-individual CV of 29.4% for metformin concentrations in 20 patients with impaired renal function.

There was a wide range (10–74%) of variability, with only four participants having CVs below 20%. This variability probably reflects the heterogeneity of the study population. The wide intra-individual variation seen in this study probably also exists in daily clinical practice.

Based on these findings we propose that:
eGFR should be used to estimate renal function in patients using metformin.
LCMSMS can be used as a routine method to evaluate trough serum concentrations of metformin and that 20 μmol/l may be used as preliminary upper therapeutic limit.
when intra-individual CV is high, the technique is less suitable for dose titration.
LCMSMS may help to differ between metformin-associated lactic acidosis and other causes.

### Dose distribution and up-titration patterns of metformin monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes [^117UkRWi]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Per the Summary of Product Characteristics from the European Medicines Agency, the minimum recommended starting dose of 500 mg metformin two times daily translates to 1000 mg/day. 9 However, in the current study, 72% of new users were initiated at doses lower than this value, and 69% remained at this dose level 6 and 12 months later. Even among new users with suboptimal glycaemic control (HbA1c ≥ 53 mmol/mol (7.0%)), 61% remained below this dose level at 12 months. Furthermore, 54% of prevalent users of metformin were receiving less than this minimum recommended daily dose. This may explain why only 51% of prevalent metformin users had met the standard HbA1C target of < 53 mmol/mol (7.0%), even after a median disease duration of 3.1 years.

The reasons for the low rates of up‐titration are speculative, but may include contraindications, intolerance and discontinuation. The NICE guidelines state that metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated in 15% of diabetes patients. 7 Contraindications include renal dysfunction and recent cardiovascular events, both of which are common among people with T2DM. 30 We investigated the effects of excluding patients with renal dysfunction, defined as eGFR < 30 (0.5% of new users and 1.0% of prevalent users) and found no change in the results. Intolerance of metformin may manifest as lactacidosis or gastrointestinal side effects, which sometimes lead to discontinuation. 20 Our analysis showed that discontinuation was the most frequent treatment pattern (among patterns involving a change) observed in the year after initiating metformin monotherapy, suggesting that many subjects were intolerant of metformin.

Key Points for Practice
- Structured diabetes self-management education programs are recommended because they improve self-efficacy and clinical outcomes.
- First-line antiglycemic treatment for type 2 diabetes and CKD with eGFR as low as 30 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 should include metformin and an SGLT2 inhibitor to improve cardiovascular outcomes and limit CKD progression. Glycemic Treatment For people with type 2 diabetes and CKD with an eGFR 30 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 or higher, metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, in combination, are recommended for first-line medical treatment because they improve glycemic control outcomes. Metformin limits weight gain and reduces cardiovascular events, whereas the SGLT2 inhibitor improves cardiovascular outcomes and limits kidney disease progression. Metformin is safe in patients with an eGFR above 45 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 unless risk for acute kidney injury is high.

The dose of metformin should be reduced when eGFR is less than 45 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 and discontinued when eGFR is less than 30 mL per minute per

1. 73 m 2 or in people treated with dialysis. SGLT2 inhibitor use can cause a reversible decline in eGFR that usually does not require stopping the medication. The SGLT2 inhibitor can be continued with an eGFR below 30 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 if well-tolerated and dialysis is not imminent. SGLT2 inhibitor use is associated with genital mycotic infections and rare diabetic ketoacidosis. Limb amputations were increased in one trial. The guidelines recommend treatment with a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in patients with type 2 diabetes who have not achieved glycemic goals despite use of metformin and an SGLT2 inhibitor or who are unable to use those medications. Some of the GLP-1 receptor agonists have a beneficial effect in reducing cardiovascular events.

GLP-1 receptor agonist trials are safe with an eGFR as low as 15 mL per minute per 1. 73 m. Am J Manag Care. 2018; 24: S138–S145.

Metformin has been used as a first‐line oral drug for people with type 2 diabetes for over 60 years. The dose of metformin should be decreased to 500 mg twice a day if eGFR is less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m² and omitted in the majority of circumstances if eGFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Of note limitations of eGFR measurements need to be appreciated especially in those at extremes of body weight and individualised treatment decisions may need to be considered in people with eGFR 25–30 mL/min/1.73m 2.

The guidelines acknowledge that there is a lack of high‐quality clinical trial evidence for the use of metformin as a cardio‐renal protective agent in people with CKD but in most countries worldwide it remains the most widely used first‐line agent for type 2 diabetes.

### Should restrictions Be relaxed for metformin use in chronic kidney disease? No, we should never again compromise safety! [^111efm94]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

Metformin is and has been considered as first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes for over a quarter of a century. Like other biguanides, metformin can cause a lactic acidosis that is exceptionally rare but fatal. The likelihood of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is substantially higher in patients with kidney impairment and also among those with seemingly normal kidney function who are at risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). Hence, regulatory agencies in many industrialized nations have maintained strict renal restrictions surrounding metformin. However, there have been millions of people exposed to metformin for many years, many of them with serum creatinine values at or close to 1.5 mg/dL with estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) much below 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) who have not developed lactic acidosis. Thus, there clearly remains controversy in this area, and there has been heightened pressure to remove the renal restrictions of metformin. To provide a discussion on the pros and cons of relaxing the renal restrictions for metformin use, we provide a Point-Counterpoint. In the point narrative below, Drs. Kalantar-Zadeh and Kovesdy provide their argument that although there is little evidence of the potential benefits of metformin in kidney disease, just considering the sheer numbers of metformin users and the high fatality rate of its associated lactic acidosis, the most appropriate practice is to avoid metformin use in people with eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or in those who are at high risk of AKI irrespective of underlying eGFR. In the following counterpoint narrative, Drs. Bakris and Molitch argue that the data from a very large analysis demonstrate clearly that serum creatinine should be supplanted with eGFR as the criteria for metformin use and that the incidence of lactic acidosis is only elevated in those with a reduced eGFR who become dehydrated for various reasons or in those exposed to some toxin resulting in AKI. Otherwise the data clearly support the use of metformin under normal circumstances down to eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)-William T. CefaluEditor in Chief, Diabetes Care.

### Use of metformin in the setting of mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency [^111qxQsP]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Two studies have attempted to translate creatinine into corresponding eGFR cut points in the context of metformin therapy. In a review of prescribing practices in the U.K. appropriate use of the drug was defined on the basis of creatinine level ≤ 1.7 mg/dL. Of 11,297 patients meeting those criteria, 82% had an eGFR < 90, 25.5% < 60, and 2.8% < 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2. The authors calculated that the eGFR threshold of 36 mL/min would result in a similar number of patients becoming ineligible for metformin compared with the serum creatinine threshold of 1.7 mg/dL (although some patients would become newly eligible and some who previously qualified would now become ineligible). The authors proposed that if the current practice is considered safe (and based on the review by Salpeter et al. this appears to be so), then a switch to an eGFR-based cut point may be both a more practical and a more accurate way to limit metformin access in those with significantly impaired renal function. In another British study of 12,482 patients with diabetes, an eGFR cutoff of 41 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 in men and 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 in women resulted in a similar proportion of patients having metformin withheld compared with the serum creatinine threshold of 1.7 mg/dL. The investigators therefore proposed the pragmatic eGFR limit of 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 to denote absolute contraindication to therapy.

### Continuous use of metformin in patients receiving contrast medium: what is the evidence? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115FUBrM]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Substantial inconsistencies exist in current guidelines regarding recommendations of metformin usage with the administration of a contrast medium. We aimed to perform a meta-analysis to determine whether the risks of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) and lactic acidosis increase with metformin use in diabetic patients receiving a contrast medium.

Methods

Studies were retrieved from databases from inception to May 15, 2021. Studies that compared the outcomes of using metformin with not using metformin during contrast medium administration were included. The primary outcomes were incidence of CI-AKI and lactic acidosis. The secondary outcomes were renal function changes from baseline. Data analysis was using risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous outcomes.

Results

Analyses of two randomized controlled trials and four retrospective cohorts examining a total of 1459 patients revealed no significant differences in the incidence of CI-AKI (RR = 1.08; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.63) and in changes in renal function measurements (serum creatinine: MD = 0.00 mg/dL, 95% CI,-0.05 to 0.05; estimated glomerular filtration rate: MD = 0.22, 95% CI,-2.47 to 2.91) after contrast medium administration between patients using and not using metformin.

Conclusions

There is no evidence that continuing metformin during contrast medium administration is associated with a higher risk of CI-AKI, lactic acidosis, or renal function deterioration compared to patients who discontinued metformin or who were not metformin users. The limited quality of the included studies may compromise the strength of evidence provided in this meta-analysis.

Key Points

There is no need to discontinue metformin either before or after intravenous contrast medium exposure in patients with eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2. In patients receiving intra-arterial contrast medium with first-pass renal exposure, there is no need to withhold metformin if eGFR is above 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. For patients who have an eGFR level between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and are receiving intra-arterial contrast medium with first-pass renal exposure, no case of lactic acidosis was observed based on present data, but further evidence is needed to make a strong suggestion regarding its safety.

### Stopping versus continuing metformin in patients with advanced CKD: a nationwide Scottish target trial emulation study [^113bgKDJ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Editorial,

Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure globally with concurrent CKD stage 3 or greater (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2) in a quarter of patients. Prescribing of glucose-lowering agents is challenging in patients with severely impaired kidney function (estimated GFR [eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2), for whom sulfonylureas are most frequently prescribed (58%). Metformin undergoes rapid renal excretion without metabolism, and prescription rates are low in patients with reduced GFR due to the risk of lactic acidosis, a rare side effect caused by metformin accumulation.

Despite the lack of a clear causal association, current UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines state that metformin should neither be initiated nor continued in patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, a threshold below which metformin is considered unsafe. Current evidence regarding the benefits and safety of metformin in patients with CKD stage 4 remains limited, with no randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing metformin with other antidiabetic agents in this population. However, in a pharmacokinetic study, Lalau et aldemonstrated that a daily metformin dose of 500 mg appeared safe in patients with CKD stage 4 (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2) with pharmacologically efficacious blood metformin concentrations and no cases of hyperlactatemia (> 5 mmol/L) reported after 4 months of treatment. It is, however, important to note that this study only examined safety over a short time period and that data on longer term safety are lacking.

Our study used the target trial emulation framework and national routinely collected health care data to compare outcomes between patients who stopped versus continued metformin after reaching CKD stage 4. We hypothesized that the continuation of metformin in this context would not be associated with adverse outcomes.

### The role of co-morbidity in the selection of antidiabetic pharmacotherapy in type-2 diabetes [^116mwjGV]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

Antidiabetic therapy in patients with impaired renal function

Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, accounting for 44% of all new cases of kidney failure in 2008 in the United States. The clearance of antidiabetic drugs is decreased and results in prolonged exposure to higher levels of the drug or its metabolites that may trigger adverse events. Observational data suggest that mortality risk in patients with type 2 diabetes and renal dysfunction increases with HbA1c levels < 6.5% and > 8.0%. Accordingly, HbA1c levels between 6.5% and 7.5% may be a reasonable target for these patients.

A number of antidiabetic drugs are contraindicated in patients when glomerular filtration rate (GFR) falls below variable thresholds, such as 25 ml/min for acarbose, 30 ml/min for exenatide and SU, 50 ml/min for DPP-4 inhibitors and 60 ml/min for metformin and liraglutide. There are scant data on the actual efficacy and safety of diabetes medications depending on patients' renal function. Furthermore, contraindications do not necessarily match with available evidence. This is exemplified with metformin: The label of metformin in the U.S. allows the prescription of metformin at or above 1.4 mg/dl serum creatinine in women and 1.5 mg/dl in men. In Germany, metformin is contraindicated in patients with a GFR < 60 ml/min. In the U.K. prescribing guidelines consider both creatinine and GFR for assessing treatment eligibility. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends reviewing prescriptions when serum creatinine exceeds 1.5 mg/dl or GFR falls below 45 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and to stop treatment at a serum creatinine of 1.7 mg/dl or a GFR of below 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2. The uncertainty is mirrored in clinical practice when metformin is prescribed despite full knowledge of the relevant cut-offs. Nevertheless, there is no evidence from prospective comparative or observational studies that metformin confers an increased risk of lactic acidosis. This was shown in a meta-analysis from 347 comparative trials and cohort studies.

### Should restrictions Be relaxed for metformin use in chronic kidney disease? Yes, they should be relaxed! what's the fuss? [^116AZ61X]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

Metformin is and has been considered as first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes for over a quarter of a century. Like other biguanides, metformin can cause a lactic acidosis that is exceptionally rare but fatal. The likelihood of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is substantially higher in patients with kidney impairment and also among those with seemingly normal kidney function who are at risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). Hence, regulatory agencies in many industrialized nations have maintained strict renal restrictions surrounding metformin. However, there have been millions of people exposed to metformin for many years, many of them with serum creatinine values at or close to 1.5 mg/dL with estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) much below 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) who have not developed lactic acidosis. Thus, there clearly remains controversy in this area, and there has been heightened pressure to remove the renal restrictions of metformin. To provide a discussion on the pros and cons of relaxing the renal restrictions for metformin use, we provide a Point-Counterpoint. In the preceding point narrative, Drs. Kalantar-Zadeh and Kovesdy provide their argument that although there is little evidence of the potential benefits of metformin in kidney disease, just considering the sheer numbers of metformin users and the high fatality rate of its associated lactic acidosis, the most appropriate practice is to avoid metformin use in people with eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or in those who are at high risk of AKI irrespective of underlying eGFR. In the counterpoint narrative below, Drs. Bakris and Molitch argue that the data from a very large analysis demonstrate clearly that serum creatinine should be supplanted with eGFR as the criteria for metformin use and that the incidence of lactic acidosis is only elevated in those with a reduced eGFR who become dehydrated for various reasons or in those exposed to some toxin resulting in AKI. Otherwise the data clearly support the use of metformin under normal circumstances down to eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)-William T. CefaluEditor in Chief, Diabetes Care.

### Appraisal of guidelines for managing contrast medium in patients with metformin: consensuses, controversies, and gaps [^113cC4by]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The current guidelines contain substantial inconsistency regarding the use of metformin concomitantly with contrast media. The objective of this study is to appraise the guidelines and summarize the agreements and differences among recommendations.

Methods

Our search focused on English language guidelines published between 2018 and 2021. Guidelines for the management of contrast media in patients with continuous metformin were included. Guidelines were assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II instrument.

Results

Six guidelines out of 1134 fulfilled the inclusion criteria with an AGREE II score of 79.2% (IQR 72.7 to 85.1%). There was good overall quality of the guidelines, with six considered "strongly recommended". CPGs scored poorly in "Clarity of Presentation" and "Applicability", with scores of 75.9% and 76.4%, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficients were excellent in each domain. There are some guidelines (33.3%) that recommend discontinuation of metformin in patients with an eGFR of < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, while some guidelines (16.7%) suggest the threshold of renal function should be eGFR < 40 mL/min/1.73 m 2.

Conclusions

Most guidelines recommend withdrawing metformin before using contrast agents in diabetic patients with severely impaired kidney function but disagree on the renal function thresholds. Furthermore, the gaps regarding discontinuing metformin with moderate renal impairment (30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 < eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2) must be considered in future studies.

Key Points

- Guidelines involving metformin and contrast agents are reliable and optimal.
- Most guidelines advocate discontinuing metformin before using contrast agents in diabetic patients with advanced renal failure, but there are controversial suggestions regarding kidney function thresholds.
- The gaps regarding the time of discontinuation of the metformin with moderate renal impairment (30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 < eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2) must be considered in the extensive RCT studies.

### Safety and effectiveness of metformin in patients with reduced renal function: a systematic review [^116r18zE]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

To examine clinical and safety outcomes associated with metformin use in patients with impaired renal function.

Materials and Methods

We searched PubMed and Embase databases from inception to August 2020, supplementing our search with a review of investigator files and reference lists of included studies. Any study reporting original data on metformin and patient-centred outcomes in patients with impaired renal function, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than60mL/min/1.73m 2, was included. Post hoc meta-analysis was performed for the outcomes of mortality, cardiovascular events and acidosis.

Results

Nine small prospective studies enrolling patients with significantly impaired renal function identified only one case of clinically apparent lactic acidosis. Among 13 larger retrospective studies, seven examined the risk of mortality across patient subgroups; meta-analysis showed reductions in overall mortality at an eGFR of 45mL/min/1.73m 2 or higher but not at an eGFR of less than 45 mL/min/1.73m 2. Eight retrospective studies evaluated acidosis as an outcome; meta-analysis showed no increase in risk of acidosis except at an eGFR of less than 30mL/min/1.73m 2, in which group the HR was 1.97 (95% CI 1.03–3.77).

Conclusions

The literature shows metformin to be associated with reduced mortality and no increased risk of acidosis at an eGFR of 45mL/min/1.73m 2 or higher. Metformin appears to be associated with fewer benefits and possible increases in the risk of acidosis at an eGFR of less than 30mL/min/1.73m 2. Consistent with US Food and Drug Administration guidelines, metformin should not be used at an eGFR less than 30mL/min/1.73m 2, and further research on its risk-benefit profile at eGFR values approaching 30 mL/min/1.73m 2 is warranted.

### Unleash metformin: reconsideration of the contraindication in patients with renal impairment [^117EGPNT]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the expanded use of metformin in renal impairment.

Data Sources

The MEDLINE database via PubMed, Web of Science, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health were searched in August 2013 and included studies from 1950 onward.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

The search included comparative trials, observational cohort studies, and meta-analyses using the terms diabetes mellitus, metformin, renal insufficiency, and acidosis, lactic.

Data Synthesis

One randomized controlled trial, 1 meta-analysis, 1 case-control, and 3 prospective-cohort studies, representing about 150 000 patients, revealed that metformin is safe in patients with stable mild-moderate renal impairment. The incidence of lactic acidosis is low and similar to sulfonylureas. In addition, reduced risks of cardiovascular disease, all-cause mortality, or any acidosis/serious infection were seen with metformin use in mild-to-moderate renal impairment.

Conclusions

Data over the past decade refute the historical contraindication in patients with renal impairment and suggest that the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is low in stable mild-to-moderate renal impairment and similar to the risk with other type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) medications with no renal impairment restrictions. Because of its unique impact on microvascular and macrovascular complications, it is advantageous to utilize metformin as the cornerstone in DM2 treatment for as long as possible, including in those patients with mild to moderate stages of renal impairment with no additional contraindications. A dosage reduction is recommended if estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is between 30 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and discontinuation if eGFR is < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2).

Metformin dosing by eGFR — Because of drug accumulation with decreased clearance and therefore a potential risk for lactic acidosis, metformin can be used without dosage reduction down to an eGFR > 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 and with a reduction to 1000 mg daily if the eGFR is ≥ 30 to 44 mL/min/1.73 m2.

### Efficacy and safety of metformin in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in older adults: a systematic review for the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^1129R7C7]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Metformin is usually prescribed as first line therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). However, the benefits and risks of metformin may be different for older people. This systematic review examined the available evidence on the safety and efficacy of metformin in the management of DM2 in older adults. The findings were used to develop recommendations for the electronic decision support tool of the European project PRIMA-eDS.

Methods

The systematic review followed a staged approach, initially searching for systematic reviews and meta-analyses first, and then individual studies when prior searches were inconclusive. The target population was older people (≥ 65 years old) with DM2. Studies were included if they reported safety or efficacy outcomes with metformin (alone or in combination) for the management of DM2 compared to placebo, usual or no treatment, or other antidiabetics. Using the evidence identified, recommendations were developed using GRADE methodology.

Results

Fifteen studies were included (4 intervention and 11 observational studies). In ten studies at least 80% of participants were 65 years or older and 5 studies reported subgroup analyses by age. Comorbidities were reported by 9 studies, cognitive status was reported by 4 studies and functional status by 1 study. In general, metformin showed similar or better safety and efficacy than other specific or non-specific active treatments. However, these findings were mainly based on retrospective observational studies. Four recommendations were developed suggesting to discontinue the use of metformin for the management of DM2 in older adults with risk factors such as age > 80, gastrointestinal complaints during the last year and/or GFR ≤ 60 ml/min.

Conclusions

On the evidence available, the safety and efficacy profiles of metformin appear to be better, and certainly no worse, than other treatments for the management of DM2 in older adults. However, the quality and quantity of the evidence is low, with scarce data on adverse events such as gastrointestinal complaints or renal failure. Further studies are needed to more reliably assess the benefits and risks of metformin in very old (> 80), cognitively and functionally impaired older people.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^112zdjSf]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease.

Kidney disease is highly prevalent in type 2 diabetes, and moderate to severe renal functional impairment (eGFR < 60 mL/min) occurs in approximately 20–30% of patients. The individual with progressive renal dysfunction is at increased risk for hypoglycemia, which is multifactorial. Insulin and, to some degree, the incretin hormones are eliminated more slowly, as are antihyperglycemic drugs with renal excretion. Thus, dose reduction may be necessary, contraindications need to be observed, and consequences (hypoglycemia, fluid retention, etc.) require careful evaluation.

Current U.S. prescribing guidelines warn against the use of metformin in patients with a serum creatinine ≥ 133 mmol/L (≥ 1.5 mg/dL) in men or 124 mmol/L (≥ 1.4 mg/dL) in women. Metformin is eliminated renally, and cases of lactic acidosis have been described in patients with renal failure. There is an ongoing debate, however, as to whether these thresholds are too restrictive and that those with mild–moderate renal impairment would gain more benefit than harm from using metformin. In the U.K. the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines are less proscriptive and more evidence-based than those in the U.S. generally allowing use down to a GFR of 30 mL/min, with dose reduction advised at 45 mL/min. Given the current widespread reporting of estimated GFR, these guidelines appear very reasonable.

### The role of vildagliptin in the therapy of type 2 diabetic patients with renal dysfunction [^115UMoF8]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

In summary, intensive glucose control reduces not only the risk for microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria but it may also decrease the rate of decline of GFR.

Patients with diabetes of long duration more frequently present with multiple comorbidities, especially chronic renal disease. Although insulin therapy is widely used in patients with T2DM and renal failure, metabolic control is particularly difficult to achieve and manage because of the limited therapeutic options and the frequent comorbidities seen in this population.

Treatment goals should be individualized and not be prescriptive, accounting for the needs of each patient, as outlined by the American Diabetes Association (ADA)/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) position statement. Although metformin is the first-line treatment for glycemic control in patients with T2DM, there is a theoretical risk for lactic acidosis in patients with CKD, since metformin is excreted unchanged by the kidney. Thus, US prescribing guidelines contraindicate metformin in patients with moderate (< 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2) to severe (< 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2) renal insufficiency for this reason. However, there is ongoing debate, and a recent critical review of the literature supports the safe use of appropriate doses of metformin in patients with chronic stable renal impairment. The recommendation from the ADA/EASD position paper is that metformin can be used down to an eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, but the dose of metformin should be reduced when eGFR is less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Kidney function should be checked regularly (every 6 months) and metformin should be discontinued if eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Metformin should be prescribed with caution in patients with an eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 which is rapidly deteriorating. All patients taking metformin should be warned that if they develop a condition that can lead to dehydration (e.g. vomiting or diarrhea), then they should stop metformin and seek medical advice. The risk for lactic acidosis is increased in such a scenario and applies irrespective of their baseline eGFR. It should be noted that metformin is part of some fixed-dose combinations, and the same risks apply.

### Use of metformin in the setting of mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency [^114XyJAG]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

When one considers the imperfect reflection of actual renal function by serum creatinine, metformin is likely used even more frequently in patients with impaired GFR than that suggested by the above studies. In the aforementioned U.S. primary practice setting, where 4.5% of patients were given metformin despite creatinine-based contraindications, 17.7% of women and 13.4% of men receiving metformin actually had an abnormally low eGFR (≤ 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2). Likewise, in another single U.S. center cross-sectional study, 15.3% of patients with type 2 diabetes and eGFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 were receiving metformin. Such frequent "inappropriate" use of metformin in patients is further suggested by data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999–2006). Among individuals with eGFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 and diabetes, 32.2% were treated with metformin and had a normal creatinine level (< 1.5 mg/dL), whereas 13.4% were treated with metformin despite a frankly elevated creatinine level (> 1.5 mg/dL). The use of metformin in mild-to-moderate CKD clearly is not at all uncommon.

### Treatment of diabetes in older adults: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^1152rvgh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Glycemic management of diabetes in older individuals — In patients aged 65 years and older with diabetes, we recommend metformin as the initial oral medication chosen for glycemic management in addition to lifestyle management, and this recommendation should not be implemented in patients who have significantly impaired kidney function [estimated GFR (eGFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2] or have a gastrointestinal intolerance; metformin is highly effective, may reduce cardiovascular events and mortality, and does not cause hypoglycemia or weight gain, and because clinical events that may precipitate acute kidney injury can cause metformin accumulation with a potential risk for lactic acidosis, metformin use is often stopped when patients are hospitalized, with vitamin B12 levels monitored yearly; in patients aged 65 years and older with diabetes who have not achieved glycemic targets with metformin and lifestyle, we recommend that other oral or injectable agents and/or insulin should be added to metformin.

Radiocontrast nephropathy risk and prevention in diabetes and chronic kidney disease are described, emphasizing discontinuation of nephrotoxins, hydration details, contrast volume thresholds, contrast type, and metformin withholding. Concomitant nephrotoxins "should be discontinued, if possible, before administering the radiographic contrast agent". Hydration studies used "0.45% sodium chloride at a dose of 1 mL/kg/h over 6 to 12 hours", and "0.9% sodium chloride may be better than 0.45% sodium chloride for preventing RCN". Contrast volume is linked to risk: "administration of more than 100 mL of hyper-osmolar radiographic contrast increases the risk of RCN", but "in those with diabetes and an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, as little as 30 mL of radiographic contrast agent can lead to acute kidney failure". An RCT reported that "iso-osmolar radiographic contrast (eg, iodixanol) is associated with significantly lower incidences of RCN than a low-osmolar contrast agent in patients with diabetes and CKD". Regarding metformin, it "should be withheld for 48 hours before infusion of contrast medium and after exposure, until the estimate or measure of GFR is greater than 40 mL/min/1.73 m2".

When there are "significant symptoms of hyperglycemia" or "a very high A1C > 10% (86 mmol/mol) or BG levels (≥ 300 mg/dL [16.7 mmol/L]), insulin is recommended".

### A randomized clinical trial of metformin to treat autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^114MmwUE]. American Journal of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Metformin inhibits cyclic AMP generation and activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which inhibits the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and Mammalian Target of Rapamycin pathways. Together these effects may reduce cyst growth in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).

Methods

A phase II, double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled trial of 26 months duration. Participants will include nondiabetic adults (n = 96) aged 18–60 years, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 and ADPKD, recruited from university-based practices in Baltimore and Boston. Participants will be randomized in 1: 1 ratio to metformin or placebo at 500 mg once daily, increased every 2 weeks to a maximum of 1,000 mg twice daily as tolerated. Dose is decreased if eGFR falls to 30–45 mL/min/1.73 m2 and discontinued at eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2.

Results

The primary outcomes are safety, assessed by the rates of hypoglycemia, elevated lactic acid levels, adverse events, and tolerability assessed by the Gastrointestinal Severity Rating Scale and maximum tolerated dose of study medication. Secondary outcomes include changes in total kidney and liver volumes, pain, and health-related quality of life, and changes in urinary metabolomic biomarkers.

Conclusions

Results of this trial will provide important information on the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of long-term use of metformin in patients with -ADPKD and provide preliminary information regarding its efficacy in slowing disease progression. Furthermore, results may support or refute the hypothesis that metformin effects on disease progression are mediated through the activation of the AMPK pathway. These results will be essential for the justification and design of a full-scale efficacy trial.

### Metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes and kidney disease: a systematic review [^113Rx3fT]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Metformin is widely viewed as the best initial pharmacological option to lower glucose concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the drug is contraindicated in many individuals with impaired kidney function because of concerns of lactic acidosis.

Objective

To assess the risk of lactic acidosis associated with metformin use in individuals with impaired kidney function.

Evidence Acquisition

In July 2014, we searched the MEDLINE and Cochrane databases for English-language articles pertaining to metformin, kidney disease, and lactic acidosis in humans between 1950 and June 2014. We excluded reviews, letters, editorials, case reports, small case series, and manuscripts that did not directly pertain to the topic area or that met other exclusion criteria. Of an original 818 articles, 65 were included in this review, including pharmacokinetic/metabolic studies, large case series, retrospective studies, meta-analyses, and a clinical trial.

Results

Although metformin is renally cleared, drug levels generally remain within the therapeutic range and lactate concentrations are not substantially increased when used in patients with mild to moderate chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rates, 30–60 mL/min per 1.73 m2). The overall incidence of lactic acidosis in metformin users varies across studies from approximately 3 per 100,000 person-years to 10 per 100,000 person-years and is generally indistinguishable from the background rate in the overall population with diabetes. Data suggesting an increased risk of lactic acidosis in metformin-treated patients with chronic kidney disease are limited, and no randomized controlled trials have been conducted to test the safety of metformin in patients with significantly impaired kidney function. Population-based studies demonstrate that metformin may be prescribed counter to prevailing guidelines suggesting a renal risk in up to 1 in 4 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus — use which, in most reports, has not been associated with increased rates of lactic acidosis. Observational studies suggest a potential benefit from metformin on macrovascular outcomes, even in patients with prevalent renal contraindications for its use.

Conclusions and Relevance

Available evidence supports cautious expansion of metformin use in patients with mild to moderate chronic kidney disease, as defined by estimated glomerular filtration rate, with appropriate dosage reductions and careful follow-up of kidney function.

CURRENT USE OF METFORMIN IN CKD

Given the current contraindications in the U.S. some might consider it a challenge to conduct a new clinical trial to evaluate the use of metformin in individuals with various degrees of impaired renal function, taking into account new criteria for assessing glomerular filtration. Yet, evidence suggests that metformin is often already used in practice outside of the current labeling contraindications, prescribed in full knowledge of the relevant cutoffs. For example, in a review of restrictions to metformin therapy conducted in Scotland, 24.5% of metformin users had filled a prescription despite active contraindications (3.4% had the specific local exclusion of a serum creatinine ≥ 1.7 mg/dL recorded twice on different days within 4 weeks). A single case of lactic acidosis during 4,600 patient-years of follow-up occurred in a patient with an extensive acute myocardial infarction who developed acute renal failure and died the same day. Given the clinical scenario, the authors intimated that acidosis had occurred because of hemodynamic compromise related to the infarct and not to metformin accumulation. In a U.S. study performed in the primary care practice setting, 4.5% of patients treated with metformin had creatinine levels > 1.4 and 1.5 mg/dL in women and men, respectively. Two other studies of sicker patients admitted to hospitals in Germany and the U.S. confirmed high frequency of metformin use despite various contraindications (73 and 27%, respectively).

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing global health challenge. In 2021, 10% of the world's population is affected by diabetes, which is one of the primary causes of CKD. The burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) also increases continuously as kidney function declines, and patients with both diabetes and CKD have an exceptionally high risk of CVD. Metformin is the first-line oral glucose-lowering drug (GLD) for individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Traditionally, metformin was contraindicated in patients with reduced kidney function due to the paucity of randomised controlled trial (RCT) data and early reports of lactic acidosis, primarily associated with phenformin. However, increasing real-world evidence supports its safety in patients with a broad range of kidney function. In 2016, the labelling of metformin was changed to include its use in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30–60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (CKD stage G3). In 2020, a consensus statement recommended continuing metformin at half maximum dose and increased frequency of eGFR monitoring in patients with eGFR of 30–44 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (CKD stage G3b) with its discontinuation when eGFR falls below 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2.

Use of metformin in CKD stage G4 (eGFR 15–29 ml/min/1.73 m 2) has been controversial. Metformin is renally cleared and the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) might be increased when eGFR fell below 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 as compared with preserved kidney function. In observational studies, the incidence rates of MALA varied from 3.0 to 138 per 100, 000 person-years amongst metformin users, though not necessarily higher than non-metformin treated controls. Discontinuation of metformin in patients with T2D was associated with increased glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of 0.92–1.09%. The loss of insulin-sensitizing effects of metformin can be pronounced in patients with advanced CKD who are generally insulin-resistant due to uremia, obesity and chronic inflammation. Most patients who discontinued metformin required addition or intensification of alternative GLDs such as insulin, which is associated with weight gain, high-risk of hypoglycaemia and often multiple daily injections. Loss of putative anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects of metformin may worsen cardiovascular-renal outcomes.

Recommended Dosing Schedule

Adults

In general, clinically significant responses are not seen at doses below 1500 mg per day. However, a lower recommended starting dose and gradually increased dosage is advised to minimize gastrointestinal symptoms.

The usual starting dose of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP is 500 mg once daily with the evening meal. Dosage increases should be made in increments of 500 mg weekly, up to a maximum of 2000 mg once daily with the evening meal. If glycemic control is not achieved on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP 2000 mg once daily, a trial of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP 1000 mg twice daily should be considered. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Studies .)

In a randomized trial, patients currently treated with metformin hydrochloride tablets were switched to metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Results of this trial suggest that patients receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets treatment may be safely switched to metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets once daily at the same total daily dose, up to 2000 mg once daily. Following a switch from metformin hydrochloride tablets to metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, glycemic control should be closely monitored and dosage adjustments made accordingly (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Studies).

Pediatrics

Safety and effectiveness of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP in pediatric patients have not been established.

Recommendations for Use in Renal Impairment

Assess renal function prior to initiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and periodically thereafter.

Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2.

Initiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with an eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2 is not recommended.

In patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit risk of continuing therapy.

Discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if the patients eGFR later falls below 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2 (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).

Discontinuation for Iodinated Contrast Imaging Procedures

Discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of liver disease, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure; restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.

Table 3
Use of SGLT2i in patients DKD: impact of eGFR

Since 2016, scientific societies have also suggested the role of SGLT2i in patients with T2DM and specific comorbidities. Table 2 summarizes some of the key position manuscripts. Overall, scientific societies recommend considering SGLT2is as preferential agents to treat T2DM on top of metformin when patients have atherosclerotic CVD, heart failure or DKD. Contrary to the FDA, which provides different regulatory advice for each drug according to specific cardiovascular safety trial results, scientific societies usually use the generic term 'SGLT2i' or 'SGLT2i with evidence of cardiovascular or renal protection'. Additionally, given the striking benefit over heart failure hospitalization, the preferential use of SGLT2i for patients with heart failure is suggested or recommended, although this was not a primary outcome of cardiovascular safety trials. Scientific societies fall short of recommending the use of SGLT2i outside the eGFR limits provided by regulatory authorities (Table 3). It is likely that the range of eGFR at which canagliflozin can be prescribed will expand in the near future, given the renal benefit observed in the CREDENCE trial of canagliflozin versus placebo in patients with overt DKD, in which patients were enrolled with eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, and canagliflozin was not stopped until renal replacement therapy was initiated (Supplementary data, Figure S2A). We believe that this supports an indication of canagliflozin at any eGFR value in non-dialysis patients, always with the caveat that initiation of SGLT2i may decrease the baseline eGFR as it decreases hyperfiltration. In this regard, in T2DM patients with DKD, canagliflozin decreased the relative risk of a composite primary outcome of ESKD (dialysis, transplantation or a sustained estimated GFR of < 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2), doubling of the serum creatinine level or death from renal or cardiovascular causes by 30% versus placebo [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.70; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59–0.82; P = 0.00001]. More specifically, a hard component of the composite, the residual risk of ESKD was reduced to 2/100 patient-years of follow-up (Supplementary data, Figure S2B). Taken together with beneficial effects over pre-specified renal outcomes such as incident or worsening nephropathy (progression to macroalbuminuria, doubling of serum creatinine, initiation of renal replacement therapy or death from renal disease) and incident albuminuria in patients with milder or no evidence of DKD in cardiovascular safety trials, overall data point to a nephroprotective effect at different stages of DKD that warrants preferential use of SGLT2i to treat T2DM patients from very early in the course of DKD, and even before its occurrence to prevent or delay it. The kidney outcomes success of SGLT2i trials for T2DM has set the stage for additional trials enrolling non-T2DM patients.

### Use of metformin in the setting of mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency [^111F2LmG]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

These reports have relied on information derived from single doses of metformin, which may not reflect chronic-treatment pharmacokinetics. In contrast, few reports have assessed the impact of renal insufficiency on metformin clearance during long-term use. Indeed, one such study concluded that metformin can be efficiently cleared in mild-to-moderate CKD. In this investigation, 24 older patients (aged 70–88 years) were administered metformin 850 mg/day or 1,700 mg/day based on CrCl of 30–60 mL/min (n = 11) or > 60 mL/min (n = 13), respectively. After 2 months, metformin remained in the therapeutic range and lactate within the reference limits in all participants. In addition, the measured levels of metformin and lactate were not statistically different between those with and without renal impairment.

Another recent study evaluated metformin levels in patients with type 2 diabetes and varying renal function. GFR was estimated based on cystatin C levels. The median dose of metformin was 1,500 mg/day. The median serum level of metformin was 4.5 µmol/L (~0.6 µg/mL) (range 0.1–20.7) in patients with eGFR > 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 (n = 107), 7.7 µmol/L (~1.0 µg/mL) (0.1–15.2) with eGFR 30–60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 (n = 21), and 8.9 µmol/L (~1.1 µg/mL) (6.0–18.6) with eGFR < 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 (n = 9). Notably, there were wide variations in these levels within each group, with few patients having serum levels > 20 µmol/L (> ~2.6 µg/mL). However, the "unsafe" metformin concentration is not really known. At usual clinical doses and schedules, steady-state plasma concentrations are generally < 1 µg/mL (< 7.8 µmol/L). Maximum plasma levels during controlled clinical trials do not generally exceed 5 µg/mL (38.8 µmol/L), but these have not typically enrolled CKD patients. Moreover, whether measurement of metformin levels actually can aid in the prediction of lactic acidosis risk remains unclear. Therefore, although these studies provide some information on the relationship between renal function and metformin concentrations, they do not clarify the issue of toxicity and lactic acidosis risk.

### Risk of acute kidney injury and survival in patients treated with metformin: an observational cohort study [^113rUxdd]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Metformin is a biguanide which has been used as first line therapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in the United Kingdom since the 1960s. In addition to its effectiveness as a treatment for type 2 diabetes, there is increasing evidence of its beneficial cardiovascular effects. There is, however, considerable debate regarding its use in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined as an estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) of less than 60 ml/min/1.73 2. Guidelines pertaining to metformin prescribing and renal impairment vary. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) previously stated that metformin was contraindicated in males with a serum creatinine above 132.6 μmol/l and females above 123.8 μmol/l or abnormal creatinine clearance. However, following a recent review of the literature, these recommendations were revised to indicate that metformin can now be used safely in patients with mild renal impairment (eGFR 45–60 ml/min/1.73 2) and in some with moderate renal impairment (eGFR < 45 ml/min/1.73 2). The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK allows prescribing of metformin in patients with an eGFR of less than 60 ml/min/1.73 2 but recommends that the dose is reduced in patients with an eGFR of less than 45 ml/min/1.73 2 (or serum creatinine of greater than 132.6 μmol/l) and metformin discontinued if eGFR is less than 30 or serum creatinine greater than 150.3 μmol/l. Current contraindications therefore exclude its use in a large proportion of patients with CKD. Following the FDA's announcement, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have also now announced that metformin-containing medicines can be used in patients with moderately reduced renal function (eGFR 30 to 59 ml/min/1.73 2).

The advent of a universally agreed serum creatinine based definition for AKI allows identification of even mild (Stage 1) AKI without relying on hospital coding systems allowing assessment of renal safety in patients with CKD.

The present study therefore aimed to examine whether current metformin use was associated with an increased rate of AKI as a proxy for lactic acidosis compared to non-use and to establish whether metformin exposure affected survival in patients with AKI.

### Metformin use reduction in renal impairment… [^1168aT5h]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

This contraindication has been widely criticized as overly conservative. 1, 3 Professional societies support metformin use at estimated glomerular filtration rates, a better measure of renal function than the serum creatinine level, of 45 or even 30 mL/min. 1 Because this contraindication may inappropriately discourage metformin use in patients with mild renal impairment, US Food and Drug Administration citizen petitions4, 5 were filed in 2012 and 2013, respectively, requesting that the contraindication be relaxed and reframed in terms of the more modern eGFR measure, although the FDA has provided no substantive response. In 2011–2012, the rate of metformin use in patients with an eGFR exceeding 90 mL/min was 90. 4%. At eGFRs greater than 60 to 90 mL/min, at which renal function is mildly impaired but the serum creatinine level is typically below the contraindication cutoff, the rate was 80. 6%.

At eGFRs of 30 to 60 mL/min, at which metformin use is usually formally contraindicated but professional guidelines1 support cautious use, rates were 48. 6% to
57. 4%. At eGFRs below 30 mL/min, at which metformin use is discouraged, the rate was 17. 9%. An estimate of the influence of renal contraindications on metformin use is summarized in the Table. If the 90. 4% use rates listed above for an eGFR exceeding 90 mL/min were seen with an eGFR greater than 60 to 90 mL/min, approximately 425 000 additional patients would take metformin. These findings are relevant to clinical care and health policy because they indicate that exaggerated concerns about the safety of metformin use in renal impairment may unnecessarily prevent its use in hundreds of thousands of patients, even at eGFRs exceeding 60 mL/min.

The approximately 50% rate of metformin nonuse in patients with eGFRs between 30 and 60 mL/min has multiple potential causes, but one likely contributing factor is the inconsistency between professional society guidelines1 and the FDA label.

Observational and interventional data associate poorer glycemic control with faster GFR loss and demonstrate correlations between HbA1c and GFR decline. In EDIC/DCCT, intensive versus conventional therapy showed fewer renal function endpoints (0.7% vs 2.8% with serum creatinine 2.0 mg/dL or greater, P = 0.004; and 1% vs 4% with creatinine clearance less than 70 mL/min/ 1.73 m2, P < 0.001). In UKPDS, intensive treatment was associated with a 67% risk reduction for a doubling of plasma creatinine at 9 years (0.71% vs 1.76%; P = 0.027). A small Italian randomized study reported stabilization of GFR decline when insulin therapy achieved HbA1c 7.0% versus greater decline with metformin at HbA1c 8.0% over a 4-year period, and other small studies showed changes from 1.35 ± 0.31 to 0.69 ± 0.13 mL/min/mo without statistical significance and preservation of GFR with a 1.2% HbA1c decrease over 2 years.

6 MODIFICATION OF USE OF APPROVED MEDICINES FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES

All medicines for T2D approved in the EU are constantly monitored with regard to safety. Since 2012, EMA has a committee dedicated to the safety of medicines for human use, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC), where all major safety issues are discussed. As an example, this has led to the inclusion of the occurrence of keto‐acidosis as a side effect of SGLT‐2 inhibitors. All suspected side effects that are reported by patients and healthcare professionals must be entered into EudraVigilance, the EU web‐based information system operated by EMA, that collects, manages and analyzes reports of suspected side effects of medicines.

New information can also lead to expansion of use. In a recent important case of regulatory action on metformin, new clinical data, epidemiological studies, clinical guidelines from medical bodies and scientific literature were considered, and led the EMA's scientific committee CHMP to conclude that metformin's permitted use in T2D should be expanded to patients with moderately reduced renal function (GFR [glomerular filtration rate] = 30‐59 mL/min). 31 As an outcome of this referral procedure, the product information of all metformin‐containing products for the treatment of T2D in the EU was revised, including clear dosing recommendations and advice on the monitoring of these patients.

If the initial A1C is ≥ 7.5%, early combination therapy with 2 agents may be needed, and with initial A1C > 9% or ≥ 1.5% above goal, 2 or 3 antihyperglycemic agents should be initiated concomitantly. If there is symptomatic hyperglycemia, an A1C > 10% and/or BG > 300 mg/dL, basal insulin should be initiated; in this scenario, a combination basal insulin with a GLP-1 RA can also be considered.

### Potential impact of prescribing metformin according to eGFR rather than serum creatinine [^114HGpJL]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Many societies recommend using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) rather than serum creatinine (sCr) to determine metformin eligibility. We examined the potential impact of these recommendations on metformin eligibility among U.S. adults.

Research Design and Methods

Metformin eligibility was assessed among 3,902 adults with diabetes who participated in the 1999–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys and reported routine access to health care, using conventional sCr thresholds (eligible if < 1.4 mg/dL for women and < 1.5 mg/dL for men) and eGFR categories: likely safe, ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m(2); contraindicated, < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2); and indeterminate, 30–44 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). Different eGFR equations were used: four-variable MDRD, Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) creatinine (CKD-EPIcr), and CKD-EPI cystatin C, as well as Cockcroft-Gault (CG) to estimate creatinine clearance (CrCl). Diabetes was defined by self-report or A1C ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol). We used logistic regression to identify populations for whom metformin was likely safe adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, and sex. Results were weighted to the U.S. adult population.

Results

Among adults with sCr above conventional cutoffs, MDRD eGFR ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m(2) was most common among men (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 33.3 [95% CI 7.4–151.5] vs. women) and non-Hispanic Blacks (aOR vs. whites 14.8 [4.27–51.7]). No individuals with sCr below conventional cutoffs had an MDRD eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2). All estimating equations expanded the population of individuals for whom metformin is likely safe, ranging from 86,900 (CKD-EPIcr) to 834,800 (CG). All equations identified larger populations with eGFR 30–44 mL/min/1.73 m(2), for whom metformin safety is indeterminate, ranging from 784,700 (CKD-EPIcr) to 1,636,000 (CG).

Conclusions

The use of eGFR or CrCl to determine metformin eligibility instead of sCr can expand the adult population with diabetes for whom metformin is likely safe, particularly among non-Hispanic blacks and men.

### Metformin for preventing the progression of chronic kidney disease [^117CxJHw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Metformin has been used in the management of diabetes for decades. It is an effective, low-cost intervention with a well-established safety profile. Emerging evidence suggests that metformin targets a number of pathways that lead to chronic kidney damage, and long-term use may, therefore, slow the rate of kidney function decline and chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of metformin therapy on kidney function decline in patients with CKD with or without diabetes mellitus and assess the safety and dose tolerability in this population.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 19 July 2023 with assistance from an Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that reported kidney-related outcomes with a minimum duration of 12 months delivery of the metformin intervention and whose eligibility criteria included adult participants with either i) a diagnosis of CKD of any aetiology and/or ii) those with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Comparisons included placebo, no intervention, non-pharmacological interventions, other antidiabetic medications or any other active control. Studies that included patients on any modality of kidney replacement therapy were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently carried out data extraction using a standard data extraction form. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

This review included 11 studies reporting on 8449 randomised participants. Studies were conducted in patient populations with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) (four studies) or diabetes mellitus (seven studies). Six studies compared metformin with no active control, four studies compared metformin with active controls (rosiglitazone, glyburide, pioglitazone, or glipizide), and one study included treatment arms that randomised to either metformin, diet and lifestyle modifications, or other antidiabetic therapies. The risk of bias in included studies varied; two studies were abstract-only publications and were judged to have a high risk of bias in most domains. Other included publications were judged to have a low risk of bias in most domains. Across comparisons, GRADE evaluations for most outcomes were judged as low or very low certainty, except for those relating to side effects, tolerance, and withdrawals, which were judged as moderate certainty. The evidence suggests that compared to placebo, metformin may result in i) a slightly smaller decline in kidney function (3 studies, 505 participants: MD 1.92 mL/min, 95% CI 0.33 to 3.51; I² = 0%; low certainty), ii) very uncertain effects on the incidence of kidney failure (1 study, 753 participants: RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.17 to 8.49), iii) little or no effect on death (3 studies, 865 participants: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.32; I² = 0%; moderate certainty), iv) little or no effect on the incidence of serious adverse events (3 studies, 576 participants: RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.72; I² = 0%; moderate certainty), and v) likely higher incidence of intolerance leading to study withdrawal than placebo (4 studies, 646 participants: RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.46 to 3.27; I² = 0%; moderate certainty). The certainty of the evidence for proteinuria was very uncertain. Compared to other active controls (rosiglitazone, glyburide, pioglitazone, or glipizide), metformin i) demonstrated very uncertain effects on kidney function decline, ii) may result in little or no difference in death (3 studies, 5608 participants: RR 0.95 95% CI 0.63 to 1.43; I² = 0%; low certainty), iii) probably results in little or no difference in intolerance leading to study withdrawal (3 studies, 5593 participants: RR 0.92, 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.08; I² = 0%; moderate certainty), iv) probably results in little or no difference in the incidence of serious adverse events (2 studies, 5545 participants: RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.71; I² = 0%; moderate certainty), and v) may increase the urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (2 studies, 3836 participants: MD 14.61, 95% CI 8.17 to 21.05; I² = 0%; low certainty). No studies reported the incidence of kidney failure.

Authors' Conclusions

This review highlights the lack of RCTs reporting on the effects of metformin on kidney function, particularly in patients with CKD. Future research in this field requires adequately powered RCTs comparing metformin to placebo or standard care in those with CKD. Seven ongoing studies were identified in this review, and future updates, including their findings, may further inform the results of this review.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^111HeQL8]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Intravenous radiocontrast use in AKI or CKD G3a–G5 — Practice Point 4.4.1.2 states that the intravenous administration of radiocontrast media can be managed in accordance with consensus statements from the radiology societies in people with AKI or GFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (CKD G3a–G5) undergoing elective investigation, with measures including use of low-osmolality contrast media and iso-osmolality contrast media and use of minimum radiocontrast dose to achieve a diagnostic study and withdrawal of nonessential potentially nephrotoxic medications. In people with eGFR > 30 ml/min per 1.73 m^2 and without evidence of AKI, metformin need not be stopped before iodinated contrast media administration, and there is no need for testing to evaluate GFR afterward; for people with AKI or an eGFR ≤ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m^2, metformin should be stopped at the time of or before ICM injection and not restarted for at least 48 hours and only then if GFR remains stable and the ongoing use of metformin has been reassessed. Given the lack of strong evidence of benefit, healthcare providers should consider withholding RAASi in people at risk for ≥ 48 hours before elective contrast-enhanced CT to avoid hypotension and hyperkalemia should CA-AKI develop, and RAASi may be restarted if CA-AKI does not occur or after the return of GFR to baseline; prophylactic pericontrast hemodialysis has been shown to be potentially harmful and is not recommended.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists for adults with type 2 diabetes: a clinical practice guideline [^112VEpub]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists when added to usual care (lifestyle interventions and/or other diabetes drugs) in adults with type 2 diabetes at different risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes?

Current Practice

Clinical decisions about treatment of type 2 diabetes have been led by glycaemic control for decades. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are traditionally used in people with elevated glucose level after metformin treatment. This has changed through trials demonstrating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) benefits independent of medications' glucose-lowering potential.

Recommendations

The guideline panel issued risk-stratified recommendations concerning the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists in adults with type 2 diabetes• Three or fewer cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation against starting SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists.• More than three cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak against starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD and CKD: Strong recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak recommendation for starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• For those committed to further reducing their risk for CVD and CKD outcomes: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors rather than GLP-1 receptor agonists.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists created these recommendations following standards for trustworthy guidelines and using the GRADE approach. The panel applied an individual patient perspective.

The Evidence

A linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (764 randomised trials included 421346 participants) of benefits and harms found that SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists generally reduce overall death, and incidence of myocardial infarctions, and end-stage kidney disease or kidney failure (moderate to high certainty evidence). These medications exert different effects on stroke, hospitalisations for heart failure, and key adverse events in different subgroups. Absolute effects of benefit varied widely based on patients' individual risk (for example, from five fewer deaths in the lowest risk to 48 fewer deaths in the highest risk, for 1000 patients treated over five years). A prognosis review identified 14 eligible risk prediction models, one of which (RECODe) informed most baseline risk estimates in evidence summaries to underpin the risk-stratified recommendations. Concerning patients' values and preferences, the recommendations were supported by evidence from a systematic review of published literature, a patient focus group study, a practical issues summary, and a guideline panel survey.

Understanding The Recommendation

We stratified the recommendations by the levels of risk for CVD and CKD and systematically considered the balance of benefits, harms, other considerations, and practical issues for each risk group. The strong recommendation for SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with CVD and CKD reflects what the panel considered to be a clear benefit. For all other adults with type 2 diabetes, the weak recommendations reflect what the panel considered to be a finer balance between benefits, harms, and burdens of treatment options. Clinicians using the guideline can identify their patient's individual risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes using credible risk calculators such as RECODe. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids may support well informed treatment choices, including shared decision making.

### Metformin and cardiorenal outcomes in diabetes: a reappraisal [^116yMrzS]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

3 METFORMIN IN CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE

3.1 Kidney disease markedly increases CV risk in patients with type 2 diabetes

A recent study in 687 732 patients with type 2 diabetes showed that 18% had a first adverse cardiorenal event during 4 years of follow‐up. 28 Chronic kidney disease (CKD) accounted for 36% of these events, and was the earliest and most common CV complication of diabetes in this population. Moreover, the appearance of CKD was associated with a 1.8‐fold increase in the risk of all‐cause or CV death. Other data from the nationally representative US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) confirm the severe adverse impact of a diagnosis of CKD on clinical outcomes in people with diabetes. 29 In this cohort, the age‐standardized mortality rate was only 4.1% higher for people with type 2 diabetes without CKD than for controls without either condition. However, the difference from the control group in age‐standardized mortality increased by 17.8% where albuminuria was present, by 23.9% where glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was abnormal, and by 47.0% where subjects had both albuminuria and abnormal GFR. Thus, the excess mortality associated with diabetes was mostly accounted for by people with CKD.

3.2 Renal safety of metformin

Intensive glycaemic control per se is widely considered to reduce the risk of end‐stage renal disease (ESRD) in type 2 diabetes, largely on the basis of a 65% reduction in this outcome in patients randomized to intensive versus standard blood glucose control policies in the ADVANCE trial (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.83, P = 0.01). 30 However, it should be noted that the confidence intervals are wide, as even in this large trial with 11 140 patients randomized, there were only 27 events over 5 years of follow‐up. 30

Metformin was contraindicated in people with CKD (estimated GFR [eGFR] < 60 mL/min/1.73m 2) for many years, however, with the intention of mitigating a perceived association between the use of metformin and an increased risk of lactic acidosis. Metformin increases serum lactate levels modestly with serum lactate concentrations usually remaining well within the normal range. 31 However, as metformin is excreted unchanged via the kidney, 32 a cautious approach to labelling of metformin has been adopted in the setting of CKD by international regulators in order to reduce the potential for accumulation and the possibility of developing lactic acidosis.
