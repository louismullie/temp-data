## Question

Could cefdinir be used for a child for cellulitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether cefdinir can be used for a child with cellulitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the usual pathogens in pediatric cellulitis. Then, I should verify cefdinir's FDA-labeled pediatric indications and dosing. Next, I will assess age appropriateness and safety. After that, I need to consider disease severity and the oral versus IV route. I will then evaluate MRSA risk and guideline-concordant alternatives. I should review the direct and indirect evidence base for cefdinir in cellulitis. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, criteria-based recommendation with monitoring and caveats [^1119mx9Q] [^116Nzh76].

> Let me first confirm the microbiology. Pediatric nonpurulent cellulitis is most commonly due to β-hemolytic streptococci (e.g. Streptococcus pyogenes) and, less often, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, which anchors the need for reliable streptococcal coverage and reasonable MSSA activity in empiric oral therapy [^1119mx9Q] [^116aZEV3].

> I need to check the label next. Cefdinir is FDA-approved in pediatric patients for uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (including β-lactamase–producing strains) and Streptococcus pyogenes, which maps directly to the typical etiologies of mild cellulitis; the key limitation is that the labeled indication is for uncomplicated disease rather than severe or complicated presentations [^116Nzh76].

> Now, age and dosing — let me verify the specifics. Safety and efficacy are established in children ≥ 6 months, with the recommended pediatric dose 14 mg/kg/day (max 600 mg/day) administered twice daily for skin infections because once-daily dosing has not been studied for this indication; adverse events such as diarrhea and rash occur more often in children ≤ 2 years, and cefdinir is contraindicated in patients with known cephalosporin allergy, with caution warranted for beta-lactam cross-hypersensitivity [^115kux9g] [^116FHqpW] [^115Rm4wv] [^116TC8Wj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about route and setting until I assess severity. Outpatient oral therapy is appropriate for children without systemic inflammatory response, hemodynamic instability, or red flags, whereas IV therapy is indicated for moderate to severe infection with systemic signs, high-risk anatomic sites (e.g., periorbital/orbital), immunocompromise, or concern for necrotizing infection; routine blood or skin cultures are not recommended for typical cellulitis without special risk features [^111ek3cL] [^112Y49h4] [^116aZEV3] [^114qvqxM].

> Let me consider where cefdinir fits among first-line oral agents. For mild to moderate, nonpurulent cellulitis with low MRSA risk, a beta-lactam that reliably covers streptococci is guideline-concordant; while cephalexin is the commonly named first-line agent, cefdinir's label-supported activity against S. pyogenes and MSSA makes it a pharmacologically reasonable alternative in the appropriate clinical context, provided the infection is uncomplicated and oral therapy is suitable [^116aZEV3] [^116Nzh76].

> But wait, what if MRSA is a concern. When MRSA risk is significant (prior MRSA, purulence, high local prevalence, prior beta-lactam failure), cefdinir monotherapy is inadequate; IDSA recommends MRSA-active agents such as clindamycin, TMP-SMX, or doxycycline (age-appropriate), and importantly, for nonpurulent cellulitis, adding MRSA coverage to a beta-lactam did not improve outcomes in a randomized trial, supporting initial beta-lactam monotherapy when MRSA risk is low [^1118k8ze] [^1116N4gR] [^1112uFJm].

> Next, I should review the direct evidence for cefdinir in cellulitis. Wait, let me verify — there are no pediatric RCTs specifically for cefdinir in cellulitis, but its approval for uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections was based on efficacy against the same organisms driving cellulitis, allowing reasonable extrapolation for mild, nonpurulent cases when MRSA risk is low and close follow-up is feasible [^116Nzh76] [^1119mx9Q].

> I will now examine practical prescribing details I need to ensure are correct. Dose cefdinir at 14 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours (max 600 mg/day) for children ≥ 6 months, separate from antacids or iron by at least 2 hours to avoid absorption interference, and consider renal function for dose adjustment per labeling; reassess clinical response at 48–72 hours and broaden or switch therapy if not improving, particularly to address potential MRSA or alternative diagnoses [^115kux9g] [^114xHwCB] [^116aZEV3].

> Hold on, I should verify escalation and step-down scenarios. Children requiring initial IV therapy for severity can be transitioned to an appropriate oral beta-lactam once clinically improved and MRSA is not suspected, with pediatric data supporting safe outpatient IV pathways in selected cases, though not specifically validating cefdinir as the sole step-down agent; selection should align with cultures if available and local susceptibility patterns [^113MYgPs] [^116aZEV3] [^111QQxmi].

> Bottom line — let me synthesize and be precise. Cefdinir is a reasonable oral option for a child with uncomplicated, mild to moderate, nonpurulent cellulitis when MRSA risk is low, the child is ≥ 6 months old, there is no cephalosporin allergy, and reliable follow-up is ensured, using 14 mg/kg/day divided twice daily up to 600 mg/day; it should not be used as monotherapy when MRSA is suspected, in severe disease needing IV therapy, or in special sites such as periorbital/orbital cellulitis where guideline-directed IV regimens and specialist input are indicated [^116Nzh76] [^115kux9g] [^111ek3cL] [^1118k8ze] [^114qvqxM].

---

Yes, cefdinir can be used for pediatric cellulitis when the infection is **mild to moderate, uncomplicated, and MRSA is not suspected**, as it covers Streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) [^116Nzh76]. It is not first-line therapy; cephalexin or clindamycin are preferred, and cefdinir should be reserved for beta-lactam allergy or intolerance. Cefdinir is **ineffective against MRSA**, so avoid it if MRSA is suspected or confirmed. The pediatric dose is **14 mg/kg/day** divided every 12 hours (max 600 mg/day) for 7–10 days [^115kux9g]. Monitor for clinical response within 48–72 hours and switch therapy if there is no improvement or if MRSA is identified [^114LP8SG].

---

## Indications and spectrum of activity

Cefdinir is a third-generation oral cephalosporin indicated for **uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (uSSTIs)** in pediatric patients [^116Nzh76], targeting **Streptococcus pyogenes** (Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci) [^116Nzh76] and **Staphylococcus aureus** (methicillin-susceptible strains [MSSA], including beta-lactamase producers) [^116Nzh76]. However, it **does not cover methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)**, a key limitation in areas with high MRSA prevalence or when MRSA is suspected.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current IDSA guidelines recommend empiric antibiotic therapy for cellulitis that **primarily targets streptococci and MSSA** [^116aZEV3]. For uncomplicated pediatric cellulitis, **Cephalexin** is preferred first line for streptococci and MSSA [^1112uFJm], while **Clindamycin** is used when MRSA coverage is needed or for beta-lactam allergy [^1118k8ze]. **Cefdinir** is a **second-line alternative**, reserved for patients with mild beta-lactam allergy or intolerance to first-line agents, and is **not recommended as first-line therapy** because it lacks MRSA coverage and may be slightly less effective than cephalexin.

---

## Clinical evidence and efficacy

Limited clinical studies directly evaluate cefdinir's efficacy in **pediatric cellulitis**. Even so, its **approved indication** for uncomplicated skin infections caused by streptococci and MSSA supports use in mild to moderate, uncomplicated cases when MRSA is not suspected [^116Nzh76]. Clinical experience suggests cefdinir is **generally effective** against susceptible organisms, though its efficacy **may be inferior** to cephalexin or clindamycin, particularly in regions with high MRSA prevalence or when MRSA is suspected.

---

## Dosage and administration

The **recommended pediatric dosage** of cefdinir for uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections is 14 mg/kg/day, divided every 12 hours (maximum 600 mg/day) [^115kux9g]. The **duration** is 7–10 days, depending on clinical response and severity; cefdinir may be administered **without regard to meals** [^113jPPLN], although food may slightly reduce absorption, and iron supplements or antacids containing magnesium or aluminum should be given at least **two hours apart** from cefdinir to avoid reduced absorption [^114xHwCB].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Cefdinir is **generally well-tolerated** in pediatric patients [^116FHqpW]. **Common adverse effects** include:

- **Gastrointestinal**: Diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain [^116K19Tu].

- **Hypersensitivity**: Rash, urticaria.

- **Rare**: Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea, anaphylaxis [^116TC8Wj].

Cefdinir is **contraindicated** in patients with known cephalosporin allergy [^115Rm4wv]. Use caution in patients with a history of penicillin allergy due to potential **cross-reactivity** [^116TC8Wj].

---

## Clinical scenarios where cefdinir may be appropriate

Cefdinir **may be appropriate** in the following clinical scenarios:

- **Mild to moderate, uncomplicated cellulitis**: Caused by streptococci or MSSA, where MRSA is not suspected [^116aZEV3].

- **Beta-lactam allergy**: Mild beta-lactam allergy or intolerance to first-line agents (cephalexin).

- **Oral therapy**: When oral therapy is preferred or required, and first-line agents are contraindicated or unavailable.

---

## Clinical scenarios where cefdinir should be avoided

Cefdinir **should be avoided** in the following clinical scenarios:

- **MRSA**: Suspected or confirmed MRSA infection [^114D2QMm].

- **Severe infection**: Severe or complicated cellulitis requiring intravenous therapy.

- **Allergy**: Known cephalosporin allergy [^115Rm4wv].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Clinical response should be **assessed within 48–72 hours** of initiating cefdinir therapy. If there is no improvement, symptoms worsen, or if MRSA is identified, antibiotic therapy should be adjusted accordingly.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Cefdinir can be used for pediatric cellulitis in **select scenarios**, particularly mild to moderate, uncomplicated infections caused by streptococci or MSSA when MRSA is not suspected. However, it is **not first-line** because it lacks MRSA coverage and may be slightly less effective than cephalexin or clindamycin. Clinicians should consider local resistance patterns, clinical severity, and patient-specific factors when selecting cefdinir for pediatric cellulitis.

### Cellulitis: A review [^1119mx9Q]. JAMA (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on cellulitis:

- **Definition**: Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue.

- **Pathophysiology**: Cellulitis is primarily caused by β-hemolytic streptococci and S. aureus.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of non-purulent lower extremity cellulitis is 176.6 per 100,000 persons in the US.

- **Disease course**: After a breach in the skin causes the entry of pathogens into the dermis, the release of bacterial toxins and other inflammatory mediators results in dermal edema, lymphatic dilation, bulla formation, and regional lymphadenopathy. Untreated infection may progress to bacteremia and systemic inflammatory response syndrome.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 17% of patients with acute cellulitis are unresponsive to initial treatment, and the risk of treatment failure is highest in obese patients. Recurrence of cellulitis occurs in approximately 14% and 45% of cases within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

### Cefdinir [^116Nzh76]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Cefdinir is indicated for various infections in pediatric patients:

- **Acute bacterial otitis media**: Caused by Haemophilus influenzae (including β-lactamase producing strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible strains only), and Moraxella catarrhalis (including β-lactamase producing strains).

- **Pharyngitis/tonsillitis**: Caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (refer to clinical studies). Cefdinir is effective in the eradication of S. pyogenes from the oropharynx. However, it has not been studied for the prevention of rheumatic fever following S. pyogenes pharyngitis/tonsillitis. Only intramuscular penicillin has been demonstrated to be effective for the prevention of rheumatic fever.

- **Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections**: Caused by Staphylococcus aureus (including β-lactamase producing strains) and Streptococcus pyogenes.

### Cefdinir [^115kux9g]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The dosage and administration guidelines include:

- **Dosage for pediatric patients**: The recommended dosage and duration of treatment for infections in pediatric patients are indicated as 14 mg/kg per day, with a maximum dose of 600 mg per day. Once-daily dosing for 10 days is as effective as twice-daily dosing (BID). For skin infections, cefdinir for oral suspension USP should be administered twice daily as once-daily dosing has not been studied. The suspension may be administered without regard to meals. Pediatric patients weighing 43 kg or more should receive the maximum daily dose of 600 mg.

- **Patients with renal insufficiency**: For adult patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min, the dose of cefdinir should be 300 mg given once daily. Creatinine clearance can be estimated using the formula where creatinine clearance is in mL/min, age is in years, weight is in kilograms, and serum creatinine is in mg/dL.

	- For pediatric patients, the following equation may be used: creatinine clearance is in mL/min/1.73 m², body length or height is in centimeters, and serum creatinine is in mg/dL. The constant K is 0.55 for pediatric patients older than 1 year and 0.45 for infants (up to 1 year).

These guidelines provide a comprehensive approach to dosing cefdinir based on patient-specific factors, ensuring effective and safe treatment outcomes.

### Who can have parenteral antibiotics at home? A prospective observational study in children with moderate/severe cellulitis [^1164f7aQ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The benefits of treating children at home or in an ambulatory setting have been well documented. We aimed to describe the characteristics and evaluate the outcomes of children with moderate/severe cellulitis treated at home with intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone via direct referral from the Emergency Department to a hospital-in-the-home (HITH) program.

- **Methods**: Patients aged 3 months to 18 years with moderate/severe cellulitis referred from a tertiary pediatric Emergency Department to HITH from September 2012 to January 2014 were prospectively identified. Data collection included demographics, clinical features, microbiological characteristics, and outcomes. To ensure home treatment did not result in inferior outcomes, these patients were retrospectively compared with patients who were hospitalized for IV flucloxacillin, the standard-of-care during the same period. The primary outcome was home treatment failure necessitating hospital admission. Secondary outcomes included antibiotic changes, complications, length of stay, and cost.

- **Results**: Forty-one (28%) patients were treated on HITH and 103 (72%) were hospitalized. Compared with hospitalized patients, HITH patients were older (P < 0.01) and less likely to have periorbital cellulitis (P = 0.01) or fever (P = 0.04). There were no treatment failures under HITH care. The rate of antibiotic changes was similar in both groups (5% vs. 7%, P = 0.67), as was IV antibiotic duration (2.3 vs. 2.5 days, P = 0.23).

- **Conclusion**: Older children with moderate/severe limb cellulitis without systemic symptoms can be treated at home.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cellulitis, more specifically with respect to the management of recurring cellulitis (hygiene practices), the IDSA 2011 guidelines suggest offering environmental hygiene measures to patients with recurring skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) in household or community settings. Counsel regarding the following:

- **Focus cleaning efforts**: On high-touch surfaces, which are surfaces that come into frequent contact with people's bare skin each day, such as counters, door knobs, bathtubs, and toilet seats, that may contact bare skin or uncovered infections.

- **Use commercially available cleaners**: Employ cleaners or detergents appropriate for the surface being cleaned, following label instructions for the routine cleaning of surfaces.

### Pediatric cellulitis: Success of emergency department short-course intravenous antibiotics [^114AdtDY]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2010). Low credibility.

The administration of 1 to 2 doses of intravenous (IV) antibiotics in the emergency department (ED), followed by discharge on oral antibiotics, has become a treatment option for children with cellulitis, despite an absence of evidence supporting this practice. The objective of this study was to determine the failure rate of ED short-course IV antibiotic therapy (IV-short course).

- **Methods**: This retrospective study included children aged 0 to 18 years diagnosed with cellulitis in a pediatric ED during the 2005 calendar year. Treatment was categorized as (a) discharge on outpatient oral antibiotics, (b) IV-short course, or (c) admission for IV antibiotics (IV-admit). Failure was defined by a subsequent visit less than 7 days since the index visit with a change in antibiotic treatment, the administration of IV antibiotics, or hospitalization. A second data abstractor reviewed 10% of the charts to allow calculation of interobserver scores.

- **Results**: There were 321 eligible children, of whom 154 were treated with oral antibiotics, 85 with IV-short course, and 82 with IV-admit. A total of 23 patients (7%) met criteria for failure. Compared with IV-admit, the odds ratio of failure among those who received IV-short course was 7.2 (95% confidence interval, 1.6–33.1). Those who received IV-short course were more likely to revisit within 7 days than children treated with oral antibiotics alone (risk ratio, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.2–4.7); however, revisits were no more frequent than among children in the IV-admit group (risk ratio, 2.8; 95% CI, 0.65–12.1).

### Pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of single-dose or multiple-dose cefiderocol in hospitalized pediatric patients three months to less than eighteen years old with infections treated with standard-of-care antibiotics in the PEDI-CEFI phase 2 study [^112zEJjM]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Low credibility.

The PEDI-CEFI study aimed to investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of cefiderocol in pediatric patients between 3 months and 2000 mg. In the multiple-dose phase of the study, although an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² was permitted in the eligibility criteria, no enrolled patient had this level of renal function. Seventeen patients had an eGFR ≥ 120 mL/min/1.73 m².

While study enrollment was relatively slow for the youngest cohort in the multiple-dose phase, and only six patients were enrolled before a decision by the sponsor and regulators to close the study, PK data from this age cohort provide some useful information.

### Pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of single-dose or multiple-dose cefiderocol in hospitalized pediatric patients three months to less than eighteen years old with infections treated with standard-of-care antibiotics in the PEDI-CEFI phase 2 study [^115jb6D7]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Five patients experienced 12 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in the single-dose phase (1 event in cohort 2, 7 in cohort 3, and 4 in cohort 4), and 7 patients experienced 10 TEAEs in the multiple-dose phase (2 events in cohort 2, 1 in cohort 3, and 7 in cohort 4). There were no deaths or treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) and no discontinuations due to treatment-related AEs. All TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. Only 1 patient, in cohort 4 of the multiple-dose phase, had 2 treatment-emergent SAEs reported by the investigator. These included a urinary tract infection (resolved on day 37) and staphylococcal bacteremia (resolved on day 44), both of which were of moderate severity and considered by the investigator to be unrelated to cefiderocol.

Throughout the study, several patients had laboratory test results outside the normal range. There was no evidence of liver toxicity with cefiderocol. No clinically significant changes in laboratory results from baseline were recorded. No abnormal findings in vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature) were observed in either the single-dose or multiple-dose phase.

A total of 18 Gram-negative bacterial isolates were collected from patients in the microbiologic intent-to-treat population, including 13 Escherichia coli, 2 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1 Enterobacter species.

### Pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of single-dose or multiple-dose cefiderocol in hospitalized pediatric patients three months to less than eighteen years old with infections treated with standard-of-care antibiotics in the PEDI-CEFI phase 2 study [^115J5gtw]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). High credibility.

Patients were stratified into four separate age cohorts: cohort 1, ages 12 to < 18 years; cohort 2, ages 6 to < 12 years; cohort 3, ages 2 to < 6 years; and cohort 4, ages 3 months to < 2 years. The single-dose phase of the study involved cohorts 1–4, while the multiple-dose phase involved cohorts 2–4. A decision by the European Medicines Agency, asserting that extrapolation from adult data was reasonable for this age group, led to cohort 1 (ages 12 to < 18 years old) being excluded from the multiple-dose phase. The minimum planned enrollment was six patients in each cohort for the single-dose phase and ten in each cohort for the multiple-dose phase, totaling 54 patients. Patients were included in only one dosing phase of the study.

In cohorts 1–3, the safety, tolerability, and plasma concentrations of cefiderocol in the single-dose phase were assessed in all six patients per cohort before opening enrollment for the multiple-dose phase of the same age cohort. The single-dose phase of cohort 4 (i.e. 3 months to < 2 years) was initiated only when safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (PK) data had been evaluated in at least six patients from single-dose cohorts 1–3, following the enrollment of a minimum of three patients in cohort 3.

### Efficacy and safety of intravenous ceftriaxone at home versus intravenous flucloxacillin in hospital for children with cellulitis (CHOICE): a single-centre, open-label, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial [^113MYgPs]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy in children is common despite no evidence of its efficacy or safety from clinical trials. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous antibiotic therapy at home with that of standard treatment in hospital for children with moderate to severe cellulitis.

- **Methods**: The Cellulitis at Home or Inpatient in Children from the Emergency Department (CHOICE) trial was a randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial in children aged 6 months to 18 years who presented to the emergency department at The Royal Children's Hospital (Melbourne, VIC, Australia) with uncomplicated moderate to severe cellulitis. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg once daily) at home or intravenous flucloxacillin (50 mg/kg every 6 h) in hospital with web-based randomisation, stratified by age and periorbital cellulitis. The primary outcome was treatment failure, which was defined as no clinical improvement or occurrence of an adverse event, resulting in a change in empiric antibiotics within 48 h of the first dose. Secondary outcomes included adverse events and acquisition of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Outcomes were assessed in all randomised participants with outcome data (intention-to-treat population) and in all individuals who received treatment as allocated and did not have any major protocol violations (per-protocol population). For home treatment to be non-inferior to hospital treatment, the difference between groups in the proportion of children with treatment failure in the in.

### Cefdinir [^11761gcm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In clinical trials involving cefdinir capsules with adult and adolescent patients, 5093 individuals (consisting of 3841 from the U.S. and 1252 from non-U.S. locations) received the recommended dose of 600 mg/day. Most adverse events observed were mild and self-limiting, with no deaths or permanent disabilities attributed to cefdinir. One hundred forty-seven patients (3%) discontinued medication due to adverse events deemed possibly, probably, or definitely associated with cefdinir therapy. These discontinuations were primarily due to gastrointestinal disturbances, usually diarrhea or nausea. Additionally, 19 patients (0.4%) discontinued use due to rashes thought to be related to cefdinir administration.

In the US, certain adverse events were identified by investigators as possibly, probably, or definitely related to cefdinir capsules during multiple-dose clinical trials involving 3841 cefdinir-treated patients.

The following laboratory value changes of potential clinical significance, regardless of their relationship to cefdinir therapy, were observed during U.S.-conducted clinical trials:

- **Adverse events**:
	- Gastrointestinal disturbances: Diarrhea, nausea
	- Skin reactions: Rashes

Further results and observations from these trials are necessary for comprehensive understanding and application in clinical settings.

### Cefdinir [^113jPPLN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Maximal plasma cefdinir concentrations occur 2 to 4 hours post-dose following capsule or suspension administration. Plasma cefdinir concentrations increase with dose, though the increases are less than dose-proportional from 300 mg (7 mg/kg) to 600 mg (14 mg/kg). Following administration of suspension to healthy adults, cefdinir bioavailability is 120% relative to capsules. The estimated bioavailability of cefdinir capsules is 21% following a 300 mg capsule dose and 16% following a 600 mg capsule dose. The estimated absolute bioavailability of cefdinir suspension is 25%. Cefdinir oral suspension of 250 mg/5 mL strength is shown to be bioequivalent to the 125 mg/5 mL strength in healthy adults under fasting conditions.

- **Effect of food**: The Cmax and AUC of cefdinir from the capsules are reduced by 16% and 10%, respectively, when given with a high-fat meal. In adults given the 250 mg/5 mL oral suspension with a high-fat meal, the Cmax and AUC of cefdinir are reduced by 44% and 33%, respectively. The magnitude of these reductions is not likely to be clinically significant because the safety and efficacy studies of oral suspension in pediatric patients were conducted without regard to food intake. Therefore, cefdinir may be taken without regard to food.

### Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of cefdinir, an oral extended spectrum cephalosporin [^111sqYvd]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2000). Low credibility.

Oral second and third-generation cephalosporins are undergoing continuous research and development in the field of pediatric infectious diseases to address gaps created by existing agents in the quest for the "ideal" antimicrobial. This paper reviews the in vitro antimicrobial activity (pharmacodynamics) and pharmacokinetics of cefdinir, an extended-spectrum oral cephalosporin, emphasizing those aspects relevant to the pediatric patient population.

- **Methods**: A MEDLINE literature search was conducted for the years 1985 through 2000, identifying all English-language papers examining the in vitro antimicrobial activity and human pharmacokinetics of cefdinir. Bibliographies of these papers were reviewed, as were relevant data on file with the manufacturer.

- **Data synthesis**: Cefdinir exhibits a broad range of in vitro activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes. It shows superior activity against Gram-positive aerobes compared to drugs like cefixime, ceftibuten, cefuroxime, and cefpodoxime. Additionally, it is stable to hydrolysis by many common betalactamases. The pharmacokinetic parameters of cefdinir in children are similar to those obtained in adults when using equivalent milligrams per m² doses (300, 600 mg in adults = 7, 14 mg/kg in children, respectively).

- **Conclusions**: The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic characteristics of cefdinir, as described in this paper, along with the results of the clinical trials program, support the use of this agent in treating a wide variety of pediatric infectious diseases.

### Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target attainment analyses for dalbavancin in pediatric patients [^117Dqssm]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Low credibility.

Acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) are a significant source of morbidity in children, with cutaneous abscesses and cellulitis being the predominant skin infections treated by pediatricians. If diagnosed early and treated appropriately, these infections are almost always curable, but some have the potential to cause hospitalization and serious life-threatening complications. Since the year 2000, rates of hospitalizations among pediatric patients with skin and skin structure infections (SSSI) have increased rapidly, with a 2013 survey showing a doubling between 1997 and 2009 to exceed 70,000 per year. This increase, which is also seen in adult patients with SSSI, coincided with the emergence of resistant pathogens, including community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA), with many areas in the United States now reporting > 40% MRSA rates among SSSI isolates.

For more than 50 years, vancomycin has been the mainstay of antibacterial therapy for severe infections caused by resistant Gram-positive organisms, including MRSA. However, vancomycin is associated with a risk of nephrotoxicity, the need for drug monitoring, and the emergence of resistant S. aureus and enterococci strains. Guidelines from the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) for the diagnosis and management of ABSSSI were published before the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency approved dalbavancin, a second-generation, intravenous (IV) lipoglycopeptide, in 2014 and 2015, respectively, for the treatment of adults with ABSSSI.

### Improving antibiotic use in pediatric preseptal cellulitis using a clinical practice guideline [^114qvqxM]. Hospital Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a clinical practice guideline (CPG) on antibiotic use and resource utilization for pediatric preseptal cellulitis.

- **Methods**: This retrospective quasiexperimental study included patients between the ages of 2 months and 17 years admitted for preseptal cellulitis between January 2013 and December 2023. The preseptal cellulitis CPG was implemented in December 2020 using a multifaceted strategy that included buy-in from key stakeholders, education of frontline providers, the official CPG launch, and stakeholder check-ins. The primary outcome was the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, including dual/triple therapy and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) active antibiotics. The secondary outcome was resource utilization, including blood testing and imaging. Outcomes were compared pre- and post-CPG implementation using the Fisher exact test and logistic regressions.

- **Results**: Of 236 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 175 and 61 patients composed the pre- and post-CPG cohorts, respectively. The median age (interquartile range) was 4.0 (1.8–8.3) years, and 46% of the population were female. Post-CPG implementation changes in empirical antibiotic use included decreases in broad-spectrum use from 100% to 66% (P < .001), dual/triple therapy from 47% to 16% (P < .001), and MRSA active agents from 86% to 26% (P < .001). There was a decrease in complete blood count and blood culture orders from 75% to 57% (P = .014) and 32% to 18% (P = .047), respectively.

- **Conclusions**: The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, including dual/triple therapy and MRSA active agents, decreased significantly following CPG implementation. Additionally, there was a reduction in resource utilization, as evidenced by reduced orders for blood tests and cultures.

### Cefdinir [^116FHqpW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Cefdinir for oral suspension was evaluated in clinical trials involving 2289 pediatric patients, with 1783 from the U.S. and 506 from non-U.S. locations. These patients were treated with the recommended dose of 14 mg/kg/day. The majority of adverse events were mild and self-limiting, with no deaths or permanent disabilities attributable to cefdinir. Discontinuation due to adverse events occurred in 40 of 2289 patients (2%), primarily for gastrointestinal disturbances, such as diarrhea, that investigators considered possibly, probably, or definitely associated with cefdinir. In addition, 5 of 2289 patients (0.2%) discontinued treatment due to rash thought to be related to cefdinir administration.

In the US, multiple-dose clinical trials included 1783 cefdinir-treated patients. Investigators believed that adverse events, such as diarrhea and rash, were possibly, probably, or definitely related to cefdinir suspension.

- **Incidence rates by age**
- **Diarrhea**: Occurred in 17% (95/557) of cefdinir-treated patients aged ≤ 2 years compared to 4% (51/1226) in those aged > 2 years.
- **Rash (primarily diaper rash)**: Occurred in 8% (43/557) of patients aged ≤ 2 years compared to 1% (8/1226) in those aged > 2 years.

It is important to note that in both cefdinir- and control-treated patients, the rates of diarrhea and rash were higher in the youngest pediatric patients.

Various laboratory value changes of possible clinical significance, irrespective of their relationship to cefdinir therapy, were observed during clinical trials conducted in the U.S.

### Management of children with uncomplicated cellulitis in emergency and hospital settings [^117MPATh]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). Low credibility.

The aim of the study is to establish consensus recommendations on features used to determine the route of antibiotic administration and disposition for children with uncomplicated cellulitis.

- **Methods**: Modified Delphi methodology was performed with two rounds of confidential surveys of emergency medicine and hospital medicine (HM) providers at Lurie Children's Hospital to assess cellulitis management in children (ages 6 months-18 years) without signs of sepsis or abscess formation. Using a 9-point Likert scale, emergency medicine providers ranked features by perceived level of importance when deciding on the initial antibiotic route, and HM providers ranked features on importance when transitioning to oral antibiotics. Responses were grouped as not important (1–3), neutral (4–6), and important (7–9) and re-evaluated in the second round to reach consensus, defined as ≥ 70% agreement.

- **Results**: Emergency medicine providers (n = 17) reached consensus on 15 of 16 features (93.8%), with 10 deemed important. Participants reached the greatest consensus (100%) on fevers/chills, lymphangitis, and functional impairment as considerations for initiating intravenous antibiotics. HM providers (n = 15) reached consensus on 9 of 11 factors (81.8%), with 7 considered important when deciding on readiness for oral antibiotics. Providers indicated that stability, rather than reduction, of erythematous margins is sufficient to consider transition and de-escalation of therapy at less than 24 hours if all other clinical improvement criteria are met.

- **Conclusions**: This study achieved consensus on important…

### Cefdinir [^111ThFkH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In clinical studies examining community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, cefdinir administered twice daily (BID) was evaluated in a controlled, double-blind study involving adults and adolescents conducted in the United States. Cefdinir was compared with cefaclor administered as 500 mg three times a day (TID). By applying strict evaluability and microbiologic/clinical response criteria 6 to 14 days after therapy, researchers observed the clinical cure rates, presumptive microbiologic eradication rates, and statistical outcomes.

In a second study, primarily conducted in Europe and involving adults and adolescents, cefdinir BID was compared with amoxicillin/clavulanate 500/125 mg TID. Similarly, strict evaluability and clinical response criteria were used 6 to 14 days post-therapy to assess clinical cure rates, presumptive microbiologic eradication rates, and statistical outcomes.

For streptococcal pharyngitis/tonsillitis, four controlled studies carried out in the United States compared 10 days of cefdinir with penicillin in adult, adolescent, and pediatric patients.

- **Study comparisons**:
	- Two studies (one involving adults and adolescents, the other pediatric patients) compared 10 days of cefdinir administered once daily (QD) or BID with penicillin 250 mg or 10 mg/kg four times a day (QID). Clinical cure rates, microbiologic eradication rates, and statistical outcomes were evaluated using strict evaluability and microbiologic/clinical response criteria 5 to 10 days post-therapy.
	- Two additional studies (again, one with adults and adolescents, the other with pediatric patients) compared 5 days of cefdinir BID to 10 days of penicillin 250 mg or 10 mg/kg QID, applying strict evaluability and microbiologic/clinical response criteria 4 to 10 days post-therapy.

### Pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of single-dose or multiple-dose cefiderocol in hospitalized pediatric patients three months to less than eighteen years old with infections treated with standard-of-care antibiotics in the PEDI-CEFI Phase 2 study [^114ZWVcd]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). High credibility.

Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are increasing globally in neonates, infants, and children; antibiotic options are limited.

- **Methods**: This international, multicenter, open-label phase 2 study investigated the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of single-dose and multiple-dose cefiderocol (as a 3-hour infusion every 8 hours, dosed at 2000 mg for body weight ≥ 34 kg and at 60 mg/kg for body weight < 34 kg) over a range of renal function in hospitalized pediatric patients with aerobic Gram-negative bacterial infection. Multiple-dose patients required standard-of-care systemic antibiotics for 5–14 days. Four cohorts of pediatric patients were enrolled: cohort 1 included participants aged 12 to < 18 years, cohort 2 included participants aged 6 to < 12 years, cohort 3 included participants aged 2 to < 6 years, and cohort 4 included participants aged 3 months to < 2 years.

- **Results**: A total of 53 patients (median age: 73.5 months) were enrolled. Plasma concentration profiles were similar with single-dose (n = 24) and multiple-dose (n = 29) cefiderocol, irrespective of age and body weight in those with normal renal function or mild renal impairment. Geometric mean concentrations at the end of infusion ranged between 72.7 and 97.1 μg/mL for single-dose cefiderocol and between 88.8 and 106.0 μg/mL after multiple doses. At 8 hours, corresponding trough concentrations ranged from 7.86 to 10.8 μg/mL with single-dose cefiderocol and from 9.64 to 18.1 μg/mL with multiple doses. There were no deaths, no cefiderocol-related serious adverse events, significant related laboratory abnormalities, or discontinuations.

In adult subjects, median (range) maximal blister fluid cefdinir concentrations of 0.65 (0.33 to 1.1) and 1.1 (0.49 to 1.9) mcg/mL were observed 4 to 5 hours following administration of 300 and 600 mg doses, respectively. Mean (± SD) blister Cmax and AUC(0-∞) values were 48% (± 13) and 91% (± 18) of corresponding plasma values.

- **Tonsil tissue**: In adult patients undergoing elective tonsillectomy, respective median tonsil tissue cefdinir concentrations 4 hours after administration of single 300 and 600 mg doses were 0.25 (0.22 to 0.46) and 0.36 (0.22 to 0.8) mcg/g. Mean tonsil tissue concentrations were 24% (± 8) of corresponding plasma concentrations.

- **Sinus tissue**: In adult patients undergoing elective maxillary and ethmoid sinus surgery, respective median sinus tissue cefdinir concentrations 4 hours after administration of single 300 and 600 mg doses were < 0.12 (< 0.12 to 0.46) and 0.21 (< 0.12 to 2) mcg/g. Mean sinus tissue concentrations were 16% (± 20) of corresponding plasma concentrations.

- **Lung tissue**: In adult patients undergoing diagnostic bronchoscopy, respective median bronchial mucosa cefdinir concentrations 4 hours after administration of single 300 and 600 mg doses were 0.78 (< 0.06 to 1.33) and 1.14 (< 0.06 to 1.92) mcg/mL, and were 31% (± 18) of corresponding plasma concentrations. Respective median epithelial lining fluid concentrations were 0.29 (< 0.3 to 4.73) and 0.49 (< 0.3 to 0.59) mcg/mL, and were 35% (± 83) of corresponding plasma concentrations.

### Cefoxitin [^114Quydz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The treatment for adults with cefoxitin consists of a usual dosage range of 1 gram to 2 grams every 6 to 8 hours. The dosage should be determined by the susceptibility of the causative organisms, the severity of the infection, and the condition of the patient. If C. trachomatis is suspected as a pathogen, appropriate anti-chlamydial coverage should be added, as cefoxitin sodium has no activity against this organism.

Cefoxitin for injection may be used in patients with reduced renal function with specific dosage adjustments. In adults with renal insufficiency, an initial loading dose of 1 gram to 2 grams may be administered. After this initial dose, recommendations for maintenance dosage may be guided by established tables. When only the serum creatinine level is available, the following formula can be used to estimate creatinine clearance, taking into account sex, weight, and age:

- **Males**: Weight (kg) x (140 - age) / (72 x serum creatinine [mg/100 mL])
- **Females**: 0.85 x the above value

For patients undergoing hemodialysis, the loading dose of 1 gram to 2 grams should be administered after each hemodialysis session. The maintenance dose should follow guidelines from established tables.

Antibiotic therapy for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections should be maintained for at least 10 days to prevent the risk of rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis. In cases of staphylococcal and other infections involving pus accumulation, surgical drainage should be performed as indicated.

### Cefdinir [^111QQxmi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of cefdinir for oral suspension, USP, and other antibacterial drugs, cefdinir for oral suspension, USP, should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Cefdinir for oral suspension, USP, is indicated for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the conditions listed below.

- **Adults and adolescents**:

	- **Community-acquired pneumonia**: Caused by Haemophilus influenzae (including β-lactamase producing strains), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (including β-lactamase producing strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible strains only), and Moraxella catarrhalis (including β-lactamase producing strains).

	- **Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis**: Caused by Haemophilus influenzae (including β-lactamase producing strains), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (including β-lactamase producing strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible strains only), and Moraxella catarrhalis (including β-lactamase producing strains).

### Gender differences in the management of pediatric orbital cellulitis [^113RR4V2]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2025). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to investigate gender differences in the disease severity and management of orbital infections in children hospitalized for treatment.

- **Methods**: Retrospective cohort study of all children aged 0 to 18 years who had a confirmed diagnosis of preseptal or postseptal cellulitis and were hospitalized over a 15-year period.

- **Results**: The sample consisted of 124 children, 52.4% male, with a mean age of 7.1 years (SD = 4.88, range = 4.9–18) and a relatively equal distribution between preseptal (52.4%) and postseptal (47.6%) cellulitis. Although males and females did not differ in rates of preseptal and postseptal cellulitis and Lund-Mackay scores (p > 0.05 for all), males were more likely to undergo surgical management (21.5% vs 8.5%; p = 0.049).

Additional research is needed to understand why the management of cellulitis differs between male and female pediatric patients and how it may affect treatment outcomes.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cellulitis, more specifically with respect to management of re-cellulitis (hygiene practices), IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend offering preventive educational messages on personal hygiene and appropriate wound care in all patients with SSTIs. Counsel regarding the following:

- **Keep draining wounds covered**: Use clean, dry bandages.

- **Maintain good personal hygiene**: Regularly bathe and clean hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand gel, particularly after touching infected skin or an item that has directly contacted a draining wound.

- **Avoid reusing or sharing personal items**: Do not share disposable razors, linens, and towels that have contacted infected skin.

### Clinical trial: Comparative effectiveness of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus cephalexin alone for treatment of uncomplicated cellulitis: A randomized controlled trial [^1148wif9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) is the most common organism isolated from purulent skin infections. Antibiotics are typically not beneficial for skin abscesses, and national guidelines do not recommend coverage for CA-MRSA in cellulitis, except in cases of purulent cellulitis, which is uncommon. Despite this, antibiotics targeting CA-MRSA are commonly and increasingly prescribed for skin infections. This may be due, in part, to the lack of experimental evidence among cellulitis patients. We tested the hypothesis that antibiotics targeting CA-MRSA are beneficial in the treatment of cellulitis.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial from 2007 to 2011. Patients with cellulitis, no abscesses, symptoms for less than one week, and no diabetes, immunosuppression, peripheral vascular disease, or hospitalization were enrolled (clinicaltrials.gov NCT00676130). All participants received cephalexin. Additionally, each was randomized to receive either trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or a placebo. We provided 14 days of antibiotics and instructed participants to continue therapy for at least one week, then stop three days after feeling cured of the infection. Our main outcome measure was the risk difference for treatment success, determined in person at two weeks, with telephone and medical record confirmation at one month.

- **Results**: We enrolled 153 participants, and 146 had outcome data for intent-to-treat analysis. The median age was 29, with a range of 3 to 74 years. Among the intervention participants, 62 out of 73 (85%) were cured versus 60 out of 73 controls (82%), yielding a risk difference of 2.7% (95% confidence).

### Cefdinir [^114xHwCB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including cefdinir for oral suspension, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g. the common cold). When cefdinir for oral suspension is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by cefdinir for oral suspension or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

- **Antacids and iron supplements**: Antacids containing magnesium or aluminum interfere with the absorption of cefdinir. If this type of antacid is required during cefdinir for oral suspension therapy, cefdinir for oral suspension should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the antacid. Similarly, iron supplements, including multivitamins that contain iron, interfere with the absorption of cefdinir. If iron supplements are required during cefdinir for oral suspension therapy, cefdinir for oral suspension should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the supplement.

- **Iron-fortified infant formula**: Iron-fortified infant formula does not significantly interfere with the absorption of cefdinir. Therefore, cefdinir for oral suspension can be administered with iron-fortified infant formula.

- **Sucrose content in diabetic patients**: Diabetic patients and caregivers should be aware that the oral suspension, 250 mg/5 mL, contains 1.37 g of sucrose per serving.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of cefdinir PO (also known as Omnicef):

- **Antimicrobial resistance**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as the use of cefdinir in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.

- **C. difficile infection**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as nearly all antibiotics, including cefdinir, are associated with an increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea.

- **Drug hypersensitivity reaction**: Use caution in patients with a history of penicillin allergy due to the risk of cross-hypersensitivity.

- **Superinfection**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as prolonged use may lead to overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms.

### Pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of single-dose or multiple-dose cefiderocol in hospitalized pediatric patients three months to less than eighteen years old with infections treated with standard-of-care antibiotics in the PEDI-CEFI phase 2 study [^116UBbaG]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). High credibility.

The limitations of this study include the low number of patients in the individual cohorts and renal function subgroups. Furthermore, patients with moderate or severe renal impairment were not enrolled; thus, extrapolation of the data to these subgroups is not possible and requires additional studies. Further data are required to confirm that the doses are appropriate for pediatric patients and that a high probability of target attainment can be achieved in pediatric patients with different age, sex, ethnicity, race, and clinical characteristics. To better understand the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of cefiderocol in pediatric patients, one clinical study is recruiting patients 3 months to less than 18 years of age (NCT04215991; expected completion in 2024), and another study is recruiting neonates and infants (NCT06086626; expected completion in 2024).

In conclusion, this study demonstrated that a 3-hour infusion of cefiderocol was adequate for providing activity against clinically relevant Gram-negative species in a variety of infection types. Cefiderocol was well tolerated in both the single-dose and multiple-dose phases of the study, with infrequent adverse events (AEs), none of which were related to cefiderocol. Thus, cefiderocol could be a valuable treatment option for pediatric patients with multi-drug-resistant (MDR) and carbapenem-resistant (CR) Gram-negative bacterial infections.

Following the administration of single 600 mg doses, cefdinir was not detected in human breast milk.

- **Pediatric use**: Safety and efficacy in neonates and infants less than 6 months of age have not been established. The use of cefdinir for the treatment of acute maxillary sinusitis in pediatric patients (age 6 months through 12 years) is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults and adolescents, the similar pathophysiology of acute sinusitis in adult and pediatric patients, and comparative pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population.

- **Geriatric use**: Efficacy is comparable in geriatric patients and younger adults. While cefdinir has been well-tolerated in all age groups, in clinical trials geriatric patients experienced a lower rate of adverse events, including diarrhea, than younger adults. Dose adjustment in elderly patients is not necessary unless renal function is markedly compromised (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

### Cefdinir [^112d7PxC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In clinical studies focused on various conditions, cefdinir's effectiveness was evaluated in several controlled trials.

- **Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia**: In a controlled, double-blind study conducted in the United States involving adults and adolescents, cefdinir BID was compared with cefaclor 500 mg TID. This study used strict evaluability as well as microbiologic and clinical response criteria 6 to 14 days post-therapy to determine clinical cure rates, presumptive microbiologic eradication rates, and statistical outcomes. A second controlled, investigator-blind study conducted primarily in Europe also compared cefdinir BID with amoxicillin/clavulanate 500/125 mg TID using similar criteria.

- **Streptococcal pharyngitis/tonsillitis**: Four controlled studies were conducted in the United States to compare cefdinir with 10 days of penicillin in adult, adolescent, and pediatric patients. Two of these studies (one in adults and adolescents, the other in pediatric patients) compared 10 days of cefdinir QD or BID to penicillin 250 mg or 10 mg/kg QID. These studies used strict evaluability along with microbiologic and clinical response criteria evaluated 5 to 10 days post-therapy. Two additional studies (one in adults and adolescents, the other in pediatric patients) compared a 5-day course of cefdinir BID to a 10-day course of penicillin 250 mg or 10 mg/kg QID, using similar evaluability and response criteria 4 to 10 days post-therapy.

### Cellulitis in pediatric patients: Recognition and management in the era of evolving resistance [^111i55wF]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Cellulitis, a bacterial skin infection most frequently caused by Group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes) and less commonly by Staphylococcus aureus, is prevalent among pediatric patients. The nonspecific clinical presentation, characterized by poorly demarcated, expanding erythema, and warmth, often mirrors other conditions, complicating accurate diagnosis. No gold standard diagnostic test for cellulitis exists, as laboratory assessments, tissue and blood cultures, and imaging studies have proven relatively unhelpful.

These adjunctive studies can be beneficial for ruling out mimickers or more severe conditions such as osteomyelitis, necrotizing fasciitis, or abscess. Diagnosis remains primarily clinical, with evaluation by a dermatologist or infectious disease specialist regarded as the clinical gold standard.

Access to specialty care and further research into beneficial adjunctive measures like thermal imaging are imperative for accurate diagnosis and management, with the aim of preventing inappropriate antibiosis.

Multidrug resistance has evolved since the emergence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), with recent studies indicating an overall decline of methicillin-resistant S. aureus in the community. However, the highest rates persist in the Southern region of the United States. Despite changing resistance patterns, inappropriate prescribing trends continue, contributing to rising resistance rates to antibiotics such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and clindamycin. The…

### Cefdinir [^111kfp2h]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Cefdinir for oral suspension in pediatric patients was evaluated in clinical trials involving 2289 participants (1783 U.S. and 506 non-U.S.). These trials used the recommended cefdinir suspension dose of 14 mg/kg/day. Most adverse events reported were mild and self-limiting, and no deaths or permanent disabilities were attributed to cefdinir.

- **Discontinuation due to adverse events**: Forty of the 2289 patients (2%) discontinued medication due to adverse events that investigators considered possibly, probably, or definitely associated with cefdinir therapy. Discontinuations were primarily for gastrointestinal disturbances, such as diarrhea. Additionally, five patients (0.2%) discontinued due to rash thought related to cefdinir administration.

- **Adverse events in U.S. clinical trials**: In the US, examiners believed several adverse events were possibly, probably, or definitely related to cefdinir suspension during multiple-dose trials (N = 1783 cefdinir-treated patients):

	- NOTE: In both cefdinir- and control-treated patients, the youngest pediatric individuals exhibited higher rates of diarrhea and rash. Specifically, the incidence of diarrhea in cefdinir-treated patients ≤ 2 years of age was 17% (95/557) compared to 4% (51/1226) in those > 2 years old. Similarly, the incidence of rash (primarily diaper rash in younger patients) was 8% (43/557) in individuals ≤ 2 years of age, compared with 1% (8/1226) in those > 2 years old.

The following laboratory value changes of possible clinical significance were noted during the U.S. clinical trials, regardless of their relationship to cefdinir therapy:

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in adults and children: Executive summary [^114D2QMm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). High credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections were prepared by an expert panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). The guidelines are intended for use by healthcare providers who care for adult and pediatric patients with MRSA infections. They discuss the management of a variety of clinical syndromes associated with MRSA disease, including skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI), bacteremia and endocarditis, pneumonia, bone and joint infections, and central nervous system (CNS) infections. Recommendations are provided regarding vancomycin dosing and monitoring, management of infections due to MRSA strains with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, and vancomycin treatment failures.

### Pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of single-dose or multiple-dose cefiderocol in hospitalized pediatric patients three months to less than eighteen years old with infections treated with standard-of-care antibiotics in the PEDI-CEFI phase 2 study [^116ocna7]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Low credibility.

- **Results**:

	- **Patient disposition**: Of 55 patients screened with appropriate assent or consent in Belgium, Estonia, Latvia, Spain, Georgia, Thailand, and Ukraine, 2 withdrew. Of the 53 patients enrolled, 24 received a single dose of cefiderocol, and 29 patients received multiple doses. Slow recruitment into the multiple-dose phase resulted in only 6 patients being enrolled in cohort 4. All patients in the single-dose phase and 89.7% and 96.6% of those in the multiple-dose phase completed treatment and the study, respectively. All patients received cefiderocol in combination with SOC.

	- **Patient characteristics**: The median (range) age of patients was 73.5 (3–190) months [6.2 (0.3–15.8) years] in the single-dose phase and 64.0 (5–143) months [5.3 (0.4–11.9) years] in the multiple-dose phase. Nine patients (37.5%) in the single-dose phase across cohorts 1–4 and 8 patients (27.6%) in the multiple-dose phase across cohorts 2–4 had eGFR of ≥ 120 mL/min/1.73 m². Most commonly, patients had complicated UTI and complicated intra-abdominal infections in both the single-dose phase and multiple-dose phase.

	- **Cefiderocol exposure in multiple-dose phase**: The median extent of cefiderocol exposure was 8.0 (range: 2–15) days, with 86.2% of patients receiving 5–14 days.

### Cefdinir [^115mnRxb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism**: Maximal plasma cefdinir concentrations occur 2 to 4 hours post-dose following capsule or suspension administration. Plasma cefdinir concentrations increase with dose, but the increases are less than dose-proportional from 300 mg (7 mg/kg) to 600 mg (14 mg/kg). Following administration of suspension to healthy adults, cefdinir bioavailability is 120% relative to capsules. Estimated bioavailability of cefdinir suspension is 25%. Cefdinir oral suspension of 250 mg/5 mL strength was shown to be bioequivalent to the 125 mg/5 mL strength in healthy adults under fasting conditions.

- **Effect of food**: In adults given the 250 mg/5 mL oral suspension with a high-fat meal, the Cmax and AUC of cefdinir are reduced by 44% and 33%, respectively. The magnitude of these reductions is not likely to be clinically significant because the safety and efficacy studies of oral suspension in pediatric patients were conducted without regard to food intake. Therefore, cefdinir may be taken without regard to food.

- **Cefdinir suspension**: Cefdinir plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameter values following administration of single 7 and 14 mg/kg oral doses of cefdinir to pediatric subjects (age 6 months to 12 years) are presented in the following table. [The referenced table is not included in the text].

### Randomized, controlled trial of antibiotics in the management of community-acquired skin abscesses in the pediatric patient [^1126Woy3]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Emergency department visits for skin and soft tissue infections are increasing with the discovery of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. It is controversial whether abscesses treated surgically also require antibiotics. There are no published pediatric randomized controlled trials evaluating the need for antibiotics in skin abscess management. This study determines the benefits of antibiotics in surgically managed pediatric skin abscesses.

This was a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. Pediatric patients were randomized to receive 10 days of placebo or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole after incision and draining. Follow-up consisted of a visit or call at 10 to 14 days and a call at 90 days. The primary outcome was treatment failure at the 10-day follow-up. The secondary outcome was new lesion development at the 10- and 90-day follow-ups. Noninferiority of placebo relative to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for primary and secondary outcomes was assessed.

One hundred sixty-one patients were enrolled, with 12 lost to follow-up. The failure rates were 5.3% (n = 4/76) and 4.1% (n = 3/73) in the placebo and antibiotic groups, respectively, yielding a difference of 1.2%, with a 1-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) (-infinity to 6.8%). Noninferiority was established with an equivalence threshold of 7%. New lesions occurred at the 10-day follow-up: 19 on placebo (26.4%) and 9 on antibiotics (12.9%), yielding a difference of 13.5%, with 95% 1-sided CI (-infinity to 24.3%). At the 3-month follow-up, 15 of 52 (28.8%) in the placebo group and 13 were affected.

### Cefdinir [^1114fzJQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Multiple dosing**: Cefdinir does not accumulate in plasma following once- or twice-daily administration to subjects with normal renal function.

- **Distribution**: The mean volume of distribution (Vdarea) of cefdinir in adult subjects is 0.35 L/kg (± 0.29); in pediatric subjects (age 6 months to 12 years), cefdinir Vdarea is 0.67 L/kg (± 0.38). Cefdinir is 60% to 70% bound to plasma proteins in both adult and pediatric subjects; binding is independent of concentration.

- **Skin blister**: In adult subjects, median (range) maximal blister fluid cefdinir concentrations of 0.65 (0.33 to 1.1) and 1.1 (0.49 to 1.9) mcg/mL were observed 4 to 5 hours following administration of 300 and 600 mg doses, respectively. Mean (± SD) blister Cmax and AUC(0-∞) values were 48% (± 13) and 91% (± 18) of corresponding plasma values.

- **Tonsil tissue**: In adult patients undergoing elective tonsillectomy, respective median tonsil tissue cefdinir concentrations 4 hours after administration of single 300 and 600 mg doses were 0.25 (0.22 to 0.46) and 0.36 (0.22 to 0.80) mcg/g. Mean tonsil tissue concentrations were 24% (± 8) of corresponding plasma concentrations.

- **Sinus tissue**: In adult patients undergoing elective maxillary and ethmoid sinus surgery, respective median sinus tissue cefdinir concentrations 4 hours after administration of single 300 and 600 mg doses were < 0.12 (< 0.12 to 0.46) and 0.21 (< 0.12 to 2) mcg/g. Mean sinus tissue concentrations were 16% (± 20) of corresponding plasma concentrations.

### Pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of single-dose or multiple-dose cefiderocol in hospitalized pediatric patients three months to less than eighteen years old with infections treated with standard-of-care antibiotics in the PEDI-CEFI Phase 2 study [^114LfUGR]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Low credibility.

The mean pharmacokinetics (PK) concentration–time profile curves in the multiple-dose phase of the study suggest that the weight-adjusted doses applied across the four age cohorts resulted in similar maximum and trough concentrations in pediatric patients. This was observed regardless of age and renal function over the ranges present in the enrolled subjects (both eGFR 60–120 and ≥ 120 mL/min/1.73 m²). Notably, dosing every eight hours for pediatric patients with eGFR ≥ 120 mL/min/1.73 m² provided sufficient exposures compared with patients with eGFR 60–120 mL/min/1.73 m², although the number of patients was limited per age cohort.

Studies in adults have reported that cefiderocol demonstrates effective lung epithelial lining fluid penetration in parallel with plasma concentrations following a single intravenous dose (2000 mg) in healthy subjects and achieves lung epithelial lining fluid concentrations sufficient to treat Gram-negative pulmonary bacterial infections with a relatively high minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ≤ 4 µg/mL in patients with pneumonia undergoing mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple cefiderocol doses (2 g every eight hours). The pharmacodynamic (PD) driver of cefiderocol efficacy is the proportion of the dosing interval spent above the MIC by the unbound antibiotic at the site of infection (% f T > MIC).

In the study, cefiderocol total trough concentrations in plasma in pediatric patients (9.64–18.1 µg/mL on average in all age groups) and 4.07–7.64 µg/mL of free drug concentrations (using an unbound fraction of 0.422) remained above the approved European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) thresholds.

The recommended dosage and duration of treatment for infections in adults and adolescents are described in the following chart; the total daily dose for all infections is 600 mg. Once-daily dosing for 10 days is as effective as BID dosing. Once-daily dosing has not been studied in pneumonia or skin infections; therefore, cefdinir capsules should be administered twice daily in these infections. Cefdinir capsules may be taken without regard to meals.

- **Patients with renal insufficiency**: For adult patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min, the dose of cefdinir should be 300 mg given once daily.

### Effect of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole vs cephalexin alone on clinical cure of uncomplicated cellulitis: A randomized clinical trial [^1112uFJm]. JAMA (2017). High credibility.

Emergency department visits for skin infections in the United States have increased with the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). For cellulitis without purulent drainage, β-hemolytic streptococci are presumed to be the predominant pathogens. It is unknown if antimicrobial regimens possessing in vitro MRSA activity provide improved outcomes compared with treatments lacking MRSA activity.

The objective was to determine whether cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole yields a higher clinical cure rate of uncomplicated cellulitis than cephalexin alone.

A multicenter, double-blind, randomized superiority trial was conducted in five US emergency departments among outpatients older than 12 years with cellulitis. Participants had no wound, purulent drainage, or abscess and were enrolled from April 2009 through June 2012. All participants received a soft tissue ultrasound at the time of enrollment to exclude abscess. The final follow-up was conducted in August 2012.

- **Interventions**: Cephalexin, 500 mg four times daily, plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily, for 7 days (n = 248 participants) or cephalexin plus placebo for 7 days (n = 248 participants).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome, determined a priori in the per-protocol group, was clinical cure. It was defined as the absence of these clinical failure criteria at follow-up visits: fever; increase in erythema (> 25%), swelling, or tenderness (days 3–4); no decrease in erythema, swelling, or tenderness (days 8–10); and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness (days 14–21).

### Evaluating an admission avoidance pathway for children in the emergency department: Outpatient intravenous antibiotics for moderate/severe cellulitis [^1167hDmG]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Children with moderate/severe cellulitis requiring intravenous antibiotics are usually admitted to the hospital. Admission avoidance is attractive, but there are few data in children. We implemented a new pathway for children to be treated with intravenous antibiotics at home and aimed to describe the characteristics of patients treated on this pathway and in hospital; we also aimed to evaluate the outcomes.

This is a prospective, observational cohort study of children aged 6 months to 18 years attending the emergency department (ED) with uncomplicated moderate/severe cellulitis from March 2014 to January 2015. Patients received either intravenous ceftriaxone at home or intravenous flucloxacillin in hospital based on physician discretion. The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as antibiotic change within 48 hours due to inadequate clinical improvement or serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes include duration of intravenous antibiotics and complications.

A total of 115 children were included: 47 (41%) in the home group and 68 (59%) in the hospital group (59 hospital-only, 9 transferred home during treatment). The groups had similar clinical features. Two out of 47 (4%) of the children in the home group compared with 8 out of 59 (14%) in the hospital group had treatment failure (P = 0.10). Duration of intravenous antibiotics (median 1.9 vs. 1.8 days, P = 0.31) and complications (6% vs. 10%, P = 0.49) were no different between groups. Home treatment costs less, averaging $A1166 (£705) per episode compared with $A2594 (£1570) in the hospital.

Children with uncomplicated cellulitis may be able to avoid hospital admission by receiving intravenous antibiotics at home, which is cost-effective and has comparable outcomes to hospital treatment.
