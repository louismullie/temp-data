## Question

pretend you are a doctor - i have a red eye, watery discharge, mild itching and it feels irritated. what are the typical symptoms of pink eye?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether their symptoms — red eye, watery discharge, mild itching, and irritation — match typical pink eye (conjunctivitis) and what the most likely cause might be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether these features fit the core definition of conjunctivitis. Then, I should verify which etiologies best match this phenotype, especially viral versus allergic versus bacterial. Next, I will review red flags that would change management or urgency. Finally, I will outline practical next steps and counseling, including hygiene and when to consider treatment or referral.

> Let me first confirm the core diagnosis: redness, discharge, itching, and irritation are classic for conjunctivitis, which is inflammation of the conjunctiva and the most common cause of a red eye in primary care and urgent care settings, so yes, this presentation is consistent with pink eye [^c25751d4] [^8b8aefb6] [^9a8f6998].

> Wait, let me verify the likely etiology from the discharge character and itch. Watery discharge plus itching strongly favors viral or allergic conjunctivitis, whereas thick, purulent discharge with eyelids matted on waking points toward bacterial disease; in adults, viral conjunctivitis predominates, and allergic conjunctivitis is also common, so the combination of watery discharge and itch makes viral or allergic more likely than bacterial here [^534f7176] [^8b8aefb6] [^5a034024].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should distinguish viral from allergic. Itching is the hallmark of allergic conjunctivitis, often bilateral with watery discharge and chemosis, and frequently coexists with allergic rhinitis symptoms like sneezing and nasal itch; viral conjunctivitis can be unilateral initially and spread to the other eye within days, and may follow a recent upper respiratory infection or have a known sick contact, so I need to check for those associated features to refine the diagnosis [^5d47c2f5] [^28f148a5] [^534f7176].

> I should double-check for red flags that would change urgency. Pain beyond mild irritation, photophobia, vision loss, severe purulent discharge, corneal involvement, contact lens wear with painful red eye, or unilateral disease with marked pain should prompt urgent ophthalmology referral; in this case, the description of "irritation" rather than pain and the absence of vision change or corneal symptoms keeps this in the nonurgent category, but I need to ensure there is no progression toward those features [^6280f593] [^713d46f2] [^a649eaab].

> Next, I should review management implications. For viral conjunctivitis, supportive care with artificial tears, cold compresses, and strict hygiene is first-line; most cases resolve in 1–2 weeks without antibiotics, and antibiotics do not shorten viral disease. For allergic conjunctivitis, topical antihistamine/mast-cell stabilizer drops are effective, and oral antihistamines can help if there is systemic allergy. I should confirm there are no contraindications and counsel on avoiding eye rubbing and allergen exposure [^534f7176] [^8b8aefb6] [^b10a3cdf].

> But wait, what if this is actually bacterial? I need to ensure I am not missing a mild bacterial presentation. Even though mucopurulent discharge and eyelid matting are more typical of bacterial disease, some bacterial cases can be subtle; if symptoms persist beyond 3–5 days, worsen, or if there is uncertainty, a short course of topical antibiotics can be considered, recognizing that many mild bacterial cases also resolve spontaneously and that delayed prescribing strategies can be reasonable to reduce overtreatment [^8b8aefb6] [^534f7176].

> I will now examine hygiene and contagion counseling because this affects both spread and recurrence. Viral and bacterial conjunctivitis are contagious via hand-to-eye contact and shared items; frequent handwashing, avoiding eye rubbing, not sharing towels or pillows, and discontinuing contact lens wear during active infection are essential; individuals are generally considered contagious until symptoms resolve, so I should reinforce these measures until the eye is fully back to normal [^ed7a956a] [^cf1b8080] [^9a8f6998].

> Let me reconsider the differential briefly to avoid anchoring. Dry eye and blepharitis can mimic some of these symptoms, but the presence of discharge and itch makes pure dry eye less likely; still, if symptoms persist or recur, I should reassess for ocular surface disease and lid margin disease, as they can coexist and complicate the picture, which would alter management toward lid hygiene, warm compresses, or meibomian-directed therapy [^e13384f8] [^9b744fdc].

> In summary, I should confirm that this presentation is typical for conjunctivitis and that viral or allergic etiologies are most likely given the watery discharge and mild itch; I will provide supportive care, reinforce hygiene, and arrange follow-up if symptoms persist, worsen, or if red flags emerge, adjusting therapy based on evolving signs and patient-specific factors [^8b8aefb6] [^534f7176] [^6280f593].

Pink eye (conjunctivitis) typically presents with **redness of the white of the eye** [^9a8f6998], **watery or mucous discharge** [^534f7176], and **itching or irritation** [^8eba8a11]. Other common features include eyelid swelling, crusting of eyelids or lashes (especially in the morning) [^8eba8a11], a gritty or foreign-body sensation, and increased tearing [^9f1dd600]. Symptoms can be unilateral or bilateral and vary by cause: viral conjunctivitis often has a clear, watery discharge and may follow a cold [^534f7176]; bacterial conjunctivitis tends to have thick, yellow-green discharge with eyelids sticking together [^5a034024]; allergic conjunctivitis features intense itching, watery discharge, and is often accompanied by sneezing or nasal congestion [^5d47c2f5]. Pain, light sensitivity, or vision changes are not typical and should prompt urgent evaluation [^6280f593].

---

## Common symptoms of pink eye

Pink eye symptoms vary by cause, but the following are **typical across etiologies**:

- **Redness**: Pink or red discoloration of the white of the eye (sclera) due to conjunctival inflammation [^9a8f6998].

- **Discharge**: Watery, mucous, or purulent discharge; viral discharge is usually clear and watery, bacterial is thick and yellow-green, and allergic is watery with stringy mucus [^534f7176] [^5a034024].

- **Itching**: Mild to intense itching, especially with allergic conjunctivitis [^5d47c2f5].

- **Irritation**: Burning, stinging, or a gritty/foreign-body sensation [^9f1dd600].

- **Swelling**: Eyelid or conjunctival edema [^28f148a5].

- **Crusting**: Eyelid or lash crusting, particularly in the morning with bacterial conjunctivitis [^5a034024].

- **Tearing**: Excess tearing or watery eyes [^9f1dd600].

- **Unilateral or bilateral**: Can affect one or both eyes [^c02e6dc2].

## Symptoms by etiology

| **Symptom** | **Viral conjunctivitis** | **Bacterial conjunctivitis** | **Allergic conjunctivitis** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Discharge | Clear, watery | Thick, yellow-green, purulent | Watery, stringy mucus |
| Itching | Mild | Mild | Intense |
| Crusting | Minimal | Eyelids stuck in morning | Minimal |
| Associated symptoms | URI, cold, flu | Ear infection | Sneezing, nasal congestion |
| Laterality | Often starts one eye, spreads to other | Unilateral or bilateral | Bilateral |

## Symptoms requiring urgent medical attention

Certain symptoms are **not typical of uncomplicated conjunctivitis** and warrant prompt evaluation:

- **Pain**: Moderate to severe eye pain [^713d46f2].

- **Photophobia**: Light sensitivity [^6280f593].

- **Vision changes**: Blurred vision, double vision, or loss of vision [^6280f593].

- **Severe purulent discharge**: Copious, thick discharge [^713d46f2].

- **Corneal involvement**: White spot on cornea or corneal opacity [^c02e6dc2].

- **Immunocompromised state**: Increased risk of serious infection [^8b8aefb6].

---

## Duration and progression

Viral conjunctivitis is **self-limited**, typically resolving within 1–2 weeks [^534f7176]; bacterial conjunctivitis usually improves within 5–7 days with antibiotics; and allergic conjunctivitis persists with allergen exposure but responds to antihistamines and allergen avoidance [^b10a3cdf].

---

## Conclusion

Pink eye typically presents with **redness, discharge, itching, and irritation**, with symptoms varying by cause. Most cases are mild and self-limited, but pain, photophobia, vision changes, or severe discharge require urgent evaluation [^713d46f2].

Conjunctivitis (pink eye)

Background

Conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the inside surface lining of the eyelids and covering of the eyeball. The eye may appear red and may have a clear or cloudy discharge. Conjunctivitis has both noninfectious and infectious causes that can be bacterial or viral. Conjunctivitis does not necessarily require treatment with topical or oral antibiotics.

Many large, community-based outbreaks of conjunctivitis, including outbreaks among school children, on college campuses, and in military facilities have been documented. – In neonates, conjunctivitis can be associated with serious invasive disease that involves multiple organs. Careful hand hygiene can reduce transmission.

Individuals who have conjunctivitis should be considered contagious until their symptoms have resolved. The viruses and bacteria that most commonly cause conjunctivitis are transmitted to eyes from hands that are contaminated with the infectious eye drainage, from contaminated objects (shared towels and washcloths, eye drop solution, or contact lens solution), or potentially by direct inoculation into the eye via large respiratory droplets from an ill individual who is coughing.

Recommendations

Restrict individuals with severe conjunctivitis (i.e. copious eye discharge, eye irritation causing frequent eye rubbing or itching, or conjunctivitis accompanied by fever or respiratory symptoms) from entering the family-centered residential facility.
Allow individuals with mild conjunctivitis ("pink eye" with no active discharge, minimum eye irritation, and no fever) to enter the facility, but require such guests to stay in their personal room until their symptoms have resolved.
Allow individuals who were exposed to a person with conjunctivitis but who do not have symptoms of illness to enter the facility. No special precautions are required.
Educate guests and visitors about the importance of frequent hand hygiene, avoidance of sharing personal items (e.g. towels and washcloths, eye drops, and contact lens solutions), and prompt removal and careful handling of contaminated items (e.g. tissues, towels, and linens).

### Not just pink eye: allergic contact dermatitis to alcaftadine 0.25% ophthalmic solution [^b7fe48b0]. Contact Dermatitis (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Discussion

Alcaftadine, the active ingredient in Lastacaft, is primarily a H 1 histamine receptor antagonist and mast cell stabiliser. It is available in the United States as an over‐the‐counter medication and is commonly used in the treatment of itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Prior to this report, only one case of ACD to alcaftadine 0.25% solution had been described.

Ketotifen and olapatadine are other antihistamines used as active ingredients in eyedrop solutions and have also been reported to cause ACD. Antihistamine eye drops are used to treat allergic conjunctivitis and ACD to these agents can present with similar symptoms, such as itching, swelling, and redness, delaying timely recognition and treatment. This report highlights the importance of considering patients' ophthalmic products as causes of periorbital dermatitis. Custom patch testing to these products can help identify novel allergens, such as alcaftadine, that are not included in a standard series and would otherwise be missed as important allergens.

Some nervous system symptoms (e.g. confusion, slow thoughts and physical movement, and delusions [false beliefs] or hallucinations [seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear]) may occur months to years after beginning efavirenz tablets therapy. Promptly contact your health care provider should any of these symptoms occur.

- Skin rash is common with efavirenz but can sometimes be severe. Skin rash usually goes away without any change in treatment. If you develop a rash with any of the following symptoms, tell your doctor right away:

- skin rash, with or without itching
- peeling skin

- fever
- mouth sores

- swelling of your face
- red or inflamed eyes, like "pink eye (conjunctivitis)

- blisters or skin lesions

- Liver problems, including liver failure and death can happen in people who take efavirenz. Liver problems can happen in people without a history of liver problems. Your doctor will do blood tests to check your liver before you start efavirenz and during treatment. Tell your doctor right away if you get any of the following symptoms:

- your skin or the white part of your eyes turns yellow (jaundice)
- you don't feel like eating food for several days or longer

Conjunctivitis — common features and field care: Among fluorescein‑negative medical eye conditions, conjunctivitis, blepharitis, and ultraviolet keratitis can usually be treated in the field and are typically not serious, and conjunctivitis is the most common cause of a red eye. Common etiologies include allergies, viruses, and bacteria; conjunctivitis always involves the palpebral conjunctiva and the examiner must look under the lid to evaluate for this inflammation. The hallmark of allergic conjunctivitis is itching; bacterial conjunctivitis gives a purulent discharge whereas viral conjunctivitis tends to give a watery discharge. Treatment of allergic and viral conjunctivitis is primarily supportive, and bacterial conjunctivitis is treated with antibiotics.

### Diagnosis and management of red eye in primary care [^c25751d4]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Red eye is the cardinal sign of ocular inflammation. The condition is usually benign and can be managed by primary care physicians. Conjunctivitis is the most common cause of red eye. Other common causes include blepharitis, corneal abrasion, foreign body, subconjunctival hemorrhage, keratitis, iritis, glaucoma, chemical burn, and scleritis. Signs and symptoms of red eye include eye discharge, redness, pain, photophobia, itching, and visual changes. Generally, viral and bacterial conjunctivitis are self-limiting conditions, and serious complications are rare. Because there is no specific diagnostic test to differentiate viral from bacterial conjunctivitis, most cases are treated using broad-spectrum antibiotics. Allergies or irritants also may cause conjunctivitis. The cause of red eye can be diagnosed through a detailed patient history and careful eye examination, and treatment is based on the underlying etiology. Recognizing the need for emergent referral to an ophthalmologist is key in the primary care management of red eye. Referral is necessary when severe pain is not relieved with topical anesthetics; topical steroids are needed; or the patient has vision loss, copious purulent discharge, corneal involvement, traumatic eye injury, recent ocular surgery, distorted pupil, herpes infection, or recurrent infections.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^b2cfd3c2]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Patient-reported symptoms and likely diagnosis — Allergic rhinitis (AR), nonallergic rhinitis (NAR), acute upper respiratory tract infection, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) without nasal polyps, and CRS with nasal polyps — are contrasted by frequency descriptors. Rhinorrhea/sniffing in AR is described as very common with clear watery discharge, whereas NAR is common but less than AR overall; in acute infection it is common and may be clear to purulent and watery to mucoid with crusts; and in CRS (with or without nasal polyps) it is common and clear to mucoid. Ocular pruritus/watery discharge/red eyes is very common in AR but uncommon in NAR and acute infection and very uncommon in CRS. Nasal congestion or blocked nose/mouth breathing is very common and persistent in AR and very common, chronic, almost universal in CRS with nasal polyps. Facial or sinus pain/pressure is very uncommon in AR yet common in acute infection and in CRS without nasal polyps. Postnasal drip is uncommon and persistent in AR but very common in NAR and common in acute infection and CRS without nasal polyps. Nasal/palate/ear itching is common in AR and very uncommon in NAR, acute infection, and CRS with or without nasal polyps. Snoring is uncommon and persistent in AR but common in the other listed conditions, and sleep disturbance/sleep apnea is common across all listed conditions. Frequencies are based on expert evidence and opinion and the table was developed based predominantly on expert opinion.

### Virtual consultation for red eye [^6280f593]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Virtual examination

After a detailed history (box 2), a subsequent video consultation is desirable but may not always be necessary, for example, if a diagnosis can be made confidently (such as conjunctivitis) or if the patient warrants a face-to-face ophthalmic examination (such as corneal infection with severe painful red eye and visual loss).

Box 2
Pointers for history taking in a patient with red eye(s)

Is it painful? Red eye with no pain or only mild discomfort is usually self limiting (fig 1). Painful red eye usually points towards more serious causes such as corneal infection, anterior uveitis, acute angle-closure glaucoma, or scleritis. In the presence of ocular pain, explore the onset, duration, progression, laterality, and severity of the pain. Ask about red flag symptoms that indicate serious conditions (box 1). Photophobia is suggestive of corneal pathologies or anterior uveitis. Pain on eye movements suggests orbital pathology.
Is it unilateral or bilateral? Acute painful red eye conditions — including corneal infection, acute angle-closure glaucoma, and scleritis — often present unilaterally. These are potentially sight threatening. Anterior uveitis may present unilaterally or bilaterally. Unilateral conjunctivitis should be a diagnosis of exclusion, after ruling out any red flag symptoms and signs.
Is there any discharge? Ocular discharge and itching are commonly associated with conjunctivitis. Viral conjunctivitis usually produces watery mucous discharge, whereas bacterial conjunctivitis produces mucopurulent discharge with crusting of the eyelashes.
Is the vision affected? Loss of vision in red eye suggests a more serious cause, particularly when the loss of vision is sudden, severe, or progressive. Reduced visual acuity with painful red eye, halos, and headache are indicative of acute angle-closure glaucoma. Serious red eye conditions such as anterior uveitis and anterior scleritis may not present with visual loss during the initial stage. New onset of double vision with red eye is suggestive of orbital pathologies, including orbital cellulitis and thyroid eye disease.
Any contact lens wear? A painful red eye in contact lens wearers should raise the suspicion of contact lens-related corneal infection. This requires an urgent ophthalmic assessment within 24 hours.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^2ea9a89c]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) — history and physical examination for initial clinical diagnosis emphasizes that Key elements of the history in patients presenting with AR include seasonal, perennial or episodic, exposure-associated itching of the nose, palate, or eyes, sneezing, nasal congestion, sniffing, clear rhinorrhea, and postnasal drip. Children may only complain of malaise or fatigue, often associated with a cough, and the history must include specific questions about rhinorrhea and nasal and ocular itch in order to elicit these complaints. Symptoms of other sinonasal diseases such as sinusitis, vasomotor rhinitis, and granulomatous diseases can overlap with AR symptoms and should be differentiated from AR, and Less typical symptoms such as epistaxis, unilateral rhinorrhea, unilateral nasal blockage, severe headache, or anosmia suggest alternative diagnoses and should be investigated further. Viral upper respiratory infections may produce similar symptoms but tend to be of a shorter duration and often include other symptoms such as fever and myalgia. A family history of AR, asthma, or atopic dermatitis strengthens the diagnosis of AR in patients with compatible symptoms. Findings on physical examination that support the diagnosis of AR include several classic findings, such as clear rhinorrhea and pale pink or bluish swelling of the nasal turbinate mucosa, and Frequent throat clearing is often present as well, reflecting postnasal drip. Although definitive diagnosis depends on the finding of an IgE-mediated response to a specific allergen, detected through cutaneous or blood testing in most patients, it is reasonable to make an initial diagnosis and begin therapy based on the history and physical examination, and A good response to avoidance of suspected allergens or appropriate empiric therapy supports the diagnosis of AR and may preclude the need for further testing.

### Reyataz [^1b5ce0aa]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

- If you take too much REYATAZ, call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away.

When your supply of REYATAZ starts to run low, get more from your healthcare provider or pharmacy. It is important not to run out of REYATAZ. The amount of HIV-1 in your blood may increase if the medicine is stopped for even a short time. The virus may become resistant to REYATAZ and harder to treat.

What are the possible side effects of REYATAZ?

REYATAZ can cause serious side effects, including:

- A change in the way your heart beats (heart rhythm change). Tell your healthcare provider right away if you get dizzy or lightheaded. These could be symptoms of a heart problem.

- Skin rash. Skin rash is common with REYATAZ but can sometimes be severe. Skin rash usually goes away within 2 weeks without any change in treatment. Severe rash may develop in association with other symptoms which could be serious. If you develop a severe rash or a rash with any of the following symptoms, stop taking REYATAZ and call your healthcare provider right away:

o

general feeling of discomfort or "flu-like" symptoms

o

fever

o

muscle or joint aches

o

red or inflamed eyes, like "pink eye" (conjunctivitis)

o

blisters

o

mouth sores

o

swelling of your face

o

painful, warm, or red lump under your skin

- Yellowing of your skin or the white part of your eyes is common with REYATAZ, and is usually not harmful in adults and infants older than 3 months of age; but it could also be a symptom of a serious problem. These effects may be due to increases in bilirubin levels in your blood (bilirubin is made by the liver). Although these effects may not be damaging to your liver, skin, or eyes, tell your healthcare provider right away if your skin or the white part of your eyes turns yellow.

### Conjunctivitis: a systematic review of diagnosis and treatment [^534f7176]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on infectious conjunctivitis:

- **Definition**: Infectious conjunctivitis is the inflammation of the conjunctiva caused by bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens.
- **Pathophysiology**: Viruses account for 80% of all cases of acute conjunctivitis, with most cases caused by adenoviruses. Other viral causes include HSV, VZV, EBV, influenza, enterovirus, and coxsackievirus. Bacterial conjunctivitis is commonly caused by S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae. Ophthalmia neonatorum is typically caused by C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae. Fungal conjunctivitis is rare and usually occurs in immunocompromised patients.
- **Epidemiology**: It is estimated that approximately 6 million cases of acute conjunctivitis occur annually in the US.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include close contact with infected individuals, poor hand hygiene, use of contaminated contact lenses, and exposure to contaminated water.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, infectious conjunctivitis presents with redness, itching, tearing, discharge, and crusting. Bacterial conjunctivitis often presents with purulent discharge, while viral conjunctivitis usually has a watery discharge and may be associated with upper respiratory tract infection symptoms. Fungal conjunctivitis may present with chronic, indolent symptoms.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Most cases of infectious conjunctivitis are self-limiting, lasting 1–2 weeks. Mild bacterial conjunctivitis typically resolves spontaneously without specific treatment in immunocompetent adults.

### Diagnosis and management of the acute red eye [^17fce930]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The red eye is one of the most frequent presenting complaints in the emergency department setting. A wide spectrum of disease processes may present as a red eye, ranging from benign self-limiting etiologies to serious vision-threatening ones. The emergency physician must be adept at recognizing "red flags" from the history and physical examination that necessitate immediate treatment and referral. In addition, it is imperative for the emergency physician to recognize the need for immediate versus elective ophthalmologist consultation for the various conditions. This article includes a discussion of the key historical features, clinical presentations, physical examination findings, and management of the more common causes of the red eye.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^36b39cf7]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Chlamydia is the cause of 1.8–5.6% of all acute conjunctivitis cases. Chlamydial conjunctivitis primarily has a unilateral presentation with concurrent genital infectionand presents with conjunctival redness, lymphoid follicle formation, or mild purulent discharge. A distinctive sign of this infection in adults is bulbar conjunctival follicles, which are absent in neonates/infants. Chlamydial conjunctivitis is typically spread through sexual contact. Chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States, with 1,708,569 cases reported in 2017. From 2013 to 2017, the number of reported cases of chlamydia in the United States increased by 22%. In neonates, the eyes can be infected after vaginal delivery by infected mothers. Treatment includes oral azithromycin or oral doxycycline in adults, and erythromycin in neonates.

Allergic Conjunctivitis

Most cases of allergic conjunctivitis are attributable to seasonal allergies and present with bilateral symptoms. Mild to severe itching and redness are the key symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis, which can present with a watery or mucoid discharge. Treatment includes supportive measures (cold compress, artificial tears), topical or oral antihistamines, and mast cell inhibitors. A short course of topical corticosteroids can be used in select cases in which corneal involvement and herpetic infection have been ruled out; both conditions could worsen with steroid use.

Differential Diagnosis

To satisfy the American Academy of Ophthalmology Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines that treatment of conjunctivitis is directed at the root cause, physicians should manage patients by taking a systematic approach (Figure 2), considering the epidemiologic spectrum of infectious conjunctivitis, patient history, clinical exam, and — if needed — diagnostic tests.

### About pink eye | Conjunctivitis (pink eye)… [^9a8f6998]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Conjunctivitis is one of the most common and treatable eye conditions.
- The most common causes of pink eye are viruses, bacteria, and allergens.
- Viral and bacterial pink eye are very contagious. What it is People often call conjunctivitis "pink eye" because it can cause the white of the eye to turn pink or red. Symptoms of pink eye can vary but typically include redness or swelling of the white of the eye or inner eyelid. The swelling makes blood vessels more visible. Signs and symptoms Some common symptoms in one or both eyes include:

- Pink or red color in the white of the eye
- Swelling of the eyelids or thin layer that lines the white of the eye
- Watery, teary eyes
- Feeling like something is in the eye or an urge to rub the eye
- Itchiness, irritation, and burning of the eye
- Discharge Other symptoms may occur. Some symptoms vary depending on the cause. Keep Reading: Symptoms of Pink Eye.

Who is at risk Anyone can get pink eye. However, newborns with symptoms of pink eye should be seen by a doctor right away. Neonatal conjunctivitis is a red or watery eye condition in a newborn caused by infection, irritation, or a blocked tear duct. When caused by an infection, neonatal conjunctivitis can be very serious. Keep Reading: Pink Eye in Newborns. Causes The most common causes of pink eye include:

- Viruses
- Bacteria
- Allergens Other causes include chemicals, contact lens wear, and foreign bodies in the eye like a loose eyelash. Keep Reading: Pink Eye: Causes and How It Spreads Prevention Viral and bacterial pink eye are very contagious. They can spread easily from person to person. You can prevent getting pink eye or spreading it to someone else by following some simple steps for good hygiene. Vaccines can prevent some infections connected to pink eye.

### How can we best diagnose severity levels of dry eye disease: current perspectives [^22f50583]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Symptoms by themselves are often inadequate for the differential diagnosis of ocular surface disease (OSD), because a wide variety of ocular surface and tear film disorders such as DED, OA, blepharitis, meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) and bacterial or viral infections can produce the same symptoms. Signs and symptoms of DED do not often correlate. Only about two-thirds of patients with dry eye symptoms test positive for DED with traditional confirmatory tests. Despite some patients having minimal objective signs such as punctate corneal fluorescein staining, they complain of severe ocular irritation, whereas others present with severe staining and have minimal symptomatology. The ability to practically examine tear biomarkers reveals that specific biomarkers correlate to the signs and symptoms in all forms of dry eye.

Typical ocular surface-related symptoms include eye irritation, burning, tearing, stinging, a gritty or foreign body sensation, photophobia, fluctuating vision, redness, intermittent sharp pain, and transient blurred vision. Environments that generate desiccating stress including high temperature, low humidity, air conditioning, and activities that lead to reduced blinking such as driving, computer use, reading, and watching television can worsen dry eye symptoms. Ocular itching, frequently referenced as the hallmark OA symptom, is not just an allergic issue, just as tear film instability is not just related to DED.DED symptoms have features of neuropathic ocular pain, including spontaneous pain, hyperalgesia and dysesthesias. Initial ocular surface damage or inflammation may cause central and/or peripheral sensitization, producing hypersensitivity and persistent DED symptoms despite the source of inflammation and/or damage being removed.

Lesions are typically edematous pink or red wheals with surrounding erythema, are generally pruritic, and individual lesions usually fade within 24 to 48 hours; painful or burning dysesthesia suggests cutaneous vasculitis, and angioedema is nonpruritic, brawny, nonpitting edema without erythema affecting the lips, tongue, eyelids, and genitalia. The clinician should obtain objective assessments of body surface area covered in hives, itch severity, and quality of life at the initial and each subsequent visit, and photographic documentation might assist in determining consistency with urticaria or angioedema. The medical work-up should be done while keeping in mind that CU is of undetermined cause in the majority of cases (C).

### Does this patient with acute infectious conjunctivitis have a bacterial infection? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^2e85962b]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Acute infectious conjunctivitis is characterized by ocular redness and discharge, and is a common clinical entity. Evidence-based tools to aid the clinical diagnosis of viral vs bacterial conjunctivitis are lacking and may contribute to overprescribing of topical antibiotics.

Objective

To determine the relative prevalence of viral vs bacterial conjunctivitis in adults and children, and to determine which symptoms or signs are suggestive of a viral vs bacterial etiology.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (January 1946-March 2022) yielded 1891 articles. Included articles were rated using a quality score based on a modified Rational Clinical Examination grading system. Methodological quality levels 1 through 4 required a microbiological reference standard for diagnosis, whereas quality level 5 (the lowest quality) used a clinical reference standard for diagnosis.

Study Selection

Consecutive series of patients presenting with acute infectious conjunctivitis and case series of viral or bacterial conjunctivitis alone. Thirty-two studies were included in a meta-analysis to determine prevalence and diagnostic accuracy measures; 27 used a microbiological reference standard for diagnosis and 5 used a clinical reference standard for diagnosis.

Results

In studies involving children (5 studies; 881 patients; mean age, 4.7 years [age range, 1 month-18 years]), the prevalence of bacterial conjunctivitis was higher than viral conjunctivitis (71% vs 16%, respectively, P = 0.01). In the only study of adults (n = 207 patients; mean age, 25.7 years), the prevalence of viral conjunctivitis was higher than bacterial conjunctivitis (78% vs 16%, respectively, P < .001). For the primary analysis of level 1 (n = 6) and level 2 (n = 5) studies (1725 patients total), the clinical findings that best distinguished a viral etiology for conjunctivitis from a bacterial etiology included pharyngitis (sensitivity range, 0.55–0.58; specificity range, 0.89–0.94; positive likelihood ratio [LR] range, 5.4–9.9), preauricular lymphadenopathy (sensitivity range, 0.17–0.31; specificity range, 0.93–0.94; positive LR range, 2.5–5.6), and contact with another person with red eye (sensitivity, 0.18 [95% CI, 0.14–0.22]; specificity, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.90–0.95]; positive LR, 2.5 [95% CI, 1.6–3.7]). Mucopurulent ocular discharge (sensitivity, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.60–0.87); specificity, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.58–0.73]; positive LR, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.7–2.6]) and otitis media (sensitivity, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.20–0.29]; specificity, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.85–0.94]; positive LR, 2.5 [95% CI, 1.5–4.4]) were associated with the presence of bacterial conjunctivitis.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this review, bacterial conjunctivitis was more common than viral conjunctivitis in children and viral conjunctivitis was more common than bacterial conjunctivitis in adults, although the prevalence estimates were based on limited evidence. Symptoms and signs associated with a higher likelihood of viral conjunctivitis in adults and children included concomitant pharyngitis, an enlarged preauricular node, and contact with another person with red eye, and signs associated with a higher likelihood of bacterial conjunctivitis included the presence of mucopurulent discharge and otitis media, but no single symptom or sign differentiated the 2 conditions with high certainty.

### Management of ocular allergy itch with an antihistamine-releasing contact lens [^b5b1fb85]. Cornea (2019). Medium credibility.

Ocular allergy is a pervasive condition that affects up to 20% of the US population, with a similar prevalence worldwide. – Allergic conjunctivitis (AC), the most common type of ocular allergy, is clinically defined as an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity response to exposure of the ocular surface to one or more allergens, including tree or grass pollens, pet dander, or dust mite dander. The impact of AC on overall health and quality of life is consistently underestimated, – and although not typically sight-threatening, AC and related conditions underlie significant loss in patient productivity and quality of life.,

Patients who wear contact lenses (CLs) are particularly impacted by AC. For daily wear CL users, it creates a higher threshold for effective hygiene to minimize allergen accumulation on lenses. Furthermore, because the primary symptom of AC is itch, patients who naturally (and often, unconsciously) respond to ocular itch with eye-rubbing cause an exacerbation of their allergic symptoms and risk damage to both their ocular surface and their lenses. Often, patients who prefer CL use for refractive correction revert to spectacle use during allergy season to avoid these complications.

Currently available antiallergic medications are generally compatible with CL use but require that lenses be removed before topical drug application. This is in part because of concerns regarding interactions between lenses and drop preservatives and also because clinical studies of allergy drops have typically excluded CL users from study populations. Without data to establish compatibility, regulatory guidelines emphasize that drops should not be used while wearing lenses.

Signs and symptoms of AC include hyperemia, watery discharge, chemosis, and itch. Although all of these conditions are seen in other ocular disorders, ocular itching is often considered pathognomonic for conjunctivitis that is of allergic origin. The itch response is due to conjunctival mast cell release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators, and thus the therapeutic approaches to AC have focused on use of topical antihistamines such as olopatadine, bepotastine, or ketotifen. These second-generation antihistamines are characterized by a rapid, prolonged suppression of allergen-associated itch responses.

Measles — background for infection prevention in residential facilities describes a highly contagious viral infection spread when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks, with infection occurring by breathing contaminated air (the virus stays in the air for up to two hours) or by touching a contaminated surface and then the eyes, noses, or mouths. Measles commonly presents with fever, cough, nasal congestion, conjunctivitis (pink eye), and a red rash that begins on the face then spreads to the entire body, and complications can include ear infections, pneumonia, croup, hepatitis, encephalitis, and diarrhea. Individuals are contagious from 4 days before the onset of rash through 4 days after the rash appears. Measles remains a leading cause of childhood disease and death globally, with recent outbreaks due to importation by travelers and infections in individuals who are immunized incompletely.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^f519976b]. Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on allergic conjunctivitis:

- **Definition**: Allergic conjunctivitis is an inflammatory disease of the conjunctiva caused by an allergic reaction.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of allergic conjunctivitis involves exposure to allergens triggering an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction, leading to mucosal inflammation and associated ocular symptoms.
- **Epidemiology**: Allergic conjunctivitis is estimated to affect 6–30% of the general population.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for allergic conjunctivitis include a personal or familial predisposition to allergies, along with environmental elements that augment exposure to allergens. These allergens may include pollen, dust mites, animal dander, pollutants, and fungal allergens.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, allergic conjunctivitis presents with symptoms such as redness, itching, eye discharge, foreign body sensation, and swollen eyelids. Some patients may also experience burning and stinging, which can be attributed to chronic neuropathic pain.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of allergic conjunctivitis is generally good. While it is a chronic condition, it can be effectively managed with treatment, including allergen avoidance, the use of antihistamines, and in some cases, specific immunotherapy.

Wilderness Medical Society — conjunctivitis in wilderness settings is common, as "Conjunctivitis is the most common cause of a red eye", with "Common etiologies includ[ing] allergies, viruses, and bacteria". Bacterial conjunctivitis "gives a purulent discharge whereas viral conjunctivitis tends to give a watery discharge". Management differs by cause: "Treatment of allergic and viral conjunctivitis is primarily supportive, and bacterial conjunctivitis is treated with antibiotics", and "studies have demonstrated that use of antibiotics results in faster clinical and microbiological remission", with "no studies showing superiority of any one antibiotic" so choice is based on availability; "Erythromycin ointment, 1-cm ribbon, placed in the lower conjunctival sac 3 or 4 times daily for 7 days is a reasonable option". Because "viral conjunctivitis is extremely contagious", "proper hand washing is essential… to avoid spread throughout a group or to the contralateral eye". "Topical anesthetic eye drops are diagnostically beneficial and provide acute relief…; however,… they should not be used chronically as they are toxic to the corneal epithelium".

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^328ad69e]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Bacterial Conjunctivitis

Approximately 32% of acute infectious conjunctivitis cases are caused by bacteria, according to an evaluation of the prevalence of positive bacterial culture in adult patients who presented to their general practitioner with a red eye and either (muco)purulent discharge or glued eyelids. Bacterial conjunctivitis is typically unilateral but can sometimes affect both eyes. The staphylococcal species are the most common pathogens for bacterial conjunctivitis in adults, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. In children, the bacterial disease is responsible for 50–75% of conjunctivitis cases, often caused by S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis. The hyperacute form of bacterial conjunctivitis is caused by either Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis.

Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is characterized by a rapid onset of conjunctival redness and mucopurulent discharge. Symptoms may also include burning and itching, though these are less common. Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is self-limiting, resolving within 7–10 days. Use of broad-spectrum topical antibiotics should be delayed, and no evidence demonstrates the superiority of any topical antibiotic agent. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) conjunctivitis is the cause of an estimated 3–64% of ocular staphylococcal infectionsand requires management by an ophthalmologist with antibiotics that are active against MRSA, such as besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension.

The rapid onset and progression of hyperacute bacterial conjunctivitis (often caused by N. gonorrhoeae) warrants immediate ophthalmic management to prevent corneal involvement and potentially perforation. Symptoms include purulent discharge, diminished visual acuity, eye tenderness, and swollen lymph nodes. The increasing incidence of gonorrhea infection was recognized in 2015 as an urgent public health threat in the United States. From 2013 to 2017 the rate of reported gonorrhea cases increased by 67% (555,608 cases in 2017), with an 18.6% increase between 2016 and 2017. Gonococcal ocular infection can present in neonates after vaginal delivery by infected mothers. Treatment includes intramuscular ceftriaxone for adults, children, and neonates, and oral azithromycin or doxycycline for adults. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention treatment guidelines changed in 2015 to support the use of dual therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin due to the increased resistance of N. gonorrhoeae to the antimicrobials previously used for treatment. Bacterial conjunctivitis lasting more than 4 weeks is considered chronic.

### Reproxalap improves ocular redness, tear production, and symptoms in a pivotal dry eye disease chamber trial [^d91de3bc]. Ophthalmology Science (2026). Medium credibility.

Although it is unlikely that dry eye disease patients are concerned with Schirmer test scores on a day-to-day basis, patients are persistently disturbed by increased ocular redness in conjunction with elevated levels of the standardly assessed dry eye symptoms of discomfort, dryness, grittiness, burning, and stinging. Relative to vehicle, the improvement in all symptoms measured in the dry eye chamber after reproxalap treatment was similar (Fig S1). Although the interpretation of symptom terminology may differ from patient to patient, and patients may not reliably distinguish certain symptoms from others, the results suggest that reproxalap could broadly diminish the development of all symptoms in the chamber. Additionally, increases in ocular itching scores observed after the 90-minute exposure to the dry eye chamber were lower after reproxalap treatment than with vehicle treatment, suggesting that itching, which is classically considered a symptom of allergic conjunctivitis, may also be characteristic of dry eye diseaseand that reproxalap may prevent the exacerbation of itching in dry eye patients, consistent with that observed in allergic conjunctivitis.,

The broad activity of reproxalap in preventing escalation of symptoms, including discomfort, in the dry eye chamber is seemingly inconsistent with the 92% of subjects that described instillation site irritation, all of which was mild in severity and most commonly lasted ≤ 1 minute. However, as has been speculated elsewhere, activation of transient receptor potential and other RASP-sensitive sensory receptors may explain both phenomena. The transient receptor potential M8 agonist, menthol, for example, induces both hot and icy sensations that may be coded as irritation upon instillation. Had irritation persisted after chamber entry, redness and symptom scores would likely have been higher after reproxalap administration than with vehicle administration, in contrast to the results, which indicated durable reduction in redness and symptoms throughout the chamber that favored reproxalap over vehicle.

### Conjunctivitis: diagnosis and management [^8b8aefb6]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Conjunctivitis caused by viruses, bacteria, or allergies is one of the most common eye conditions in primary care. There is no single sign or symptom that accurately differentiates viral from bacterial conjunctivitis. A comprehensive history and physical examination can guide diagnosis. Viral and allergic conjunctivitis are more common in adults and typically present with watery discharge. Supportive care options for viral conjunctivitis include artificial tears, cold compresses, and antihistamine eye drops. Strict personal hygiene, including frequent handwashing, is essential to decrease the risk of transmission. Topical antihistamines with mast cell-stabilizing activity are the treatment of choice for allergic conjunctivitis. Bacterial conjunctivitis is more common in children and typically presents as mucopurulent discharge with the eyelids matted shut. Delayed antibiotic prescribing has been found to have similar symptom control as immediate prescribing. Ophthalmology referral is indicated for conjunctivitis in a neonate or patients with severe pain, decreased vision, recent ocular surgery, vesicular rash on the eyelids or nose, history of rheumatologic disease, or immunocompromised state.

### The review of ophthalmic symptoms in COVID-19 [^622f4713]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Ophthalmological Symptoms in the Course of COVID-19

The latest studies and meta-analyses have confirmed a more frequent occurrence of ophthalmological symptoms in COVID-19 patients, ranging from 2 to 32%. The most common ophthalmological symptoms reported by patients were conjunctivitis, eye pain, swelling and redness. Often, the first visible ophthalmological symptom of COVID-19 infection was conjunctivitis. In a 2020 study of 2347 patients with confirmed infection, 11.64% had ophthalmological symptoms related to the ocular surface, including eye pain and redness with discharge. The majority of patients (31.2%) reported eye pain. In another study from 2021, the analysis of 7300 patients revealed the occurrence of ocular symptoms during COVID-19 infection in 11.03% of patients, including symptoms such as: dry eye or foreign body sensation (16%), redness (13.3%), tearing (12.8%), itching (12.6%), eye pain (9.6%) and discharge (8.8%). Conjunctivitis was the most frequently reported ophthalmological complaint in COVID-19 patients and occurred in 88.8% of respondents. Much less common ophthalmic pathologies have also been described, such as keratoconjunctivitis (2.2%), episcleritis (2.2%), scleritis (2.2%), posterior ischemic optic neuropathy and neuropathy (1.1%) (Figure 1).

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^307e3dce]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis Preferred Practice Pattern — Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2)/Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19) conjunctivitis more often presents with unilateral than bilateral conjunctival injection, with a typical follicular reaction that may include chemosis, watery discharge, superficial keratitis, and pseudomembranes. Associated factors include SARS‑CoV‑2 exposure, unprotected eye exposure, significant travel history, or respiratory symptoms. The natural history is that it usually occurs early in disease with mild inflammation and disappearance of symptoms within a few days of treatment, has relatively low incidence/prevalence compared with other systemic manifestations and is more common in children, and may be isolated or associated with systemic symptoms. Potential sequelae are that conjunctival symptoms appear self‑limited with variable duration (5–21 days), and typically there is no effect on visual acuity and no short‑term complications.

### A randomized, multicenter phase 3 clinical trial evaluating intracanalicular dexamethasone insert for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^2a21d6c5]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a dexamethasone insert when placed in the canaliculus of the eyelid for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis using a modified version of the CAC model. The primary efficacy endpoint of lower mean ocular itching scores at Day 8 was met. The dexamethasone insert group had a statistically significant treatment difference over the placebo group at the 1 week post-insertion series of challenges, demonstrating an early onset of action. Additionally, the dexamethasone insert group showed significant treatment differences compared to the placebo group at 23 of 24 time points evaluated, demonstrating duration of action for at least 2 weeks in this study. Together these findings support the use of the dexamethasone insert to reduce ocular itching quickly (within the first 7 days following insertion) and to maintain this benefit for at least 2 weeks after insertion. The dexamethasone insert also showed efficacy in reducing conjunctival redness, with significant improvements in conjunctival redness scores at all 18 post-CAC time points. The results of this study are consistent with previously reported phase 2 and phase 3 studies of the dexamethasone insert in subjects with allergic conjunctivitis using a similar repeat CAC model, despite differing slightly in study visit schedule.

In addition to showing a benefit in itching and redness, which are 2 of the most common patient complaints related to allergic conjunctivitis, the dexamethasone insert showed a directional benefit in eyelid swelling, tearing/watery eyes, and nasal symptoms (rhinorrhea, nasal pruritus, and nasal congestion). Nasal congestion may be the primary complaint in individuals with rhinoconjunctivitis, followed by ocular symptoms.

The dexamethasone insert was generally safe and well tolerated with no serious or severe ocular or non-ocular AEs observed. In the dexamethasone insert arm, 2 subjects experienced ocular AEs that were considered related to treatment: eye discharge and eye irritation. This safety profile is in line with prior phase 2 and 3 studies in allergic conjunctivitis and clinical studies with the same insert following cataract surgery. Moreover, there have been few treatment-related AEs with the dexamethasone insert: 2 in the current study and 14 in prior phase 2 and 3 allergic conjunctivitis and cataract surgery studies (N = 632).

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^a7e7c3c3]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Examination

Some initial diagnosis is necessary to exclude any potentially serious cause of acute red eye. Historical features for evaluation include pain or photophobia, which can be signs of bacterial keratitis, anterior uveitis, or acute angle-closure glaucoma. Associated symptoms such as upper respiratory tract infection, or known exposure to others who have presented with this, suggest a viral form of conjunctivitis. Patient history of ocular trauma should be considered as a potential alternative cause of inflammation. A corneal abrasion resulting from a foreign body or exposure to the sun or ultraviolet light can present as red eye. Red, painful and watery eyes due to corneal or conjunctival foreign bodies can masquerade as acute and chronic forms of conjunctivitis. Presence of a foreign body is elucidated via history, and by careful biomicroscopic exam. In those who wear contact lenses, the risk of corneal involvement and bacterial keratitis is high; therefore, these individuals should be referred to an eye care provider. Some signs and symptoms of acute infectious conjunctivitis are mimicked by dry eye disease such as hyperemia, grittiness and stinging. Adhering to the triage questions and risk factor analysis recommended by the Tear Film & Ocular Surface Society Dry Eye Workshop II (TFOS DEWS II)aids the exclusion of dry eye disease, although it may coexist with acute infectious conjunctivitis owing to the high prevalence of both conditions. Of the immune-mediated forms of conjunctivitis (eg, ocular mucous membrane pemphigoid, graft-versus-host disease, Stevens-Johnson syndrome), generally early and milder manifestations of immune-mediated conjunctivopathy may share symptomatology with acute infectious conjunctivitis because of the presence of nonspecific complaints (eg, redness, tearing, clear discharge) and conjunctival injection. However, these types of conjunctivitis often differ from viral conjunctivitis in their time course; they are generally protracted and more easily confused with a chronic process rather than an acute episode.

### Rifampin [^879a4ed1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Information for Patients

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including rifampin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When rifampin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by rifampin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

The patient should be told that rifampin may produce a discoloration (yellow, orange, red, brown) of the teeth, urine, sweat, sputum, and tears, and the patient should be forewarned of this. Soft contact lenses may be permanently stained.

Rifampin is a well characterized and potent inducer of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters and might therefore decrease or increase concomitant drug exposure and impact safety and efficacy (see DRUG INTERACTIONS). Therefore, patients should be advised not to take any other medication without medical advice.

The patient should be advised that the reliability of oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives may be affected; consideration should be given to using alternative contraceptive measures.

Patients should be instructed to take rifampin either 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal with a full glass of water.

Patients should be instructed to notify their physician immediately if they experience any of the following: rash with fever or blisters, with or without peeling skin, itching, or swollen lymph nodes, loss of appetite, malaise, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, darkened urine, yellowish discoloration of the skin and eyes, light-colored bowel movements, fever, headache, fatigue, myalgias, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, wheezing and pain or swelling of the joints.

Patients should be advised to seek medical advice immediately if their symptoms of mycobacterial disease, including, but not limited to, cough, fever, tiredness, shortness of breath, malaise, headache, pain, night sweats, swollen lymph nodes, loss of appetite, weight loss, weakness, skin ulcers or lesions, worsen (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Advise patients to abstain from alcohol, hepatotoxic medications or herbal products while taking rifampin.

Compliance with the full course of therapy must be emphasized, and the importance of not missing any doses must be stressed.

Medication history will also be informative. For example, anticoagulants are associated with subconjunctival hemorrhage, and topiramate is associated with angle-closure glaucoma. Patients requiring steroids may be at risk of more severe disease or other pathology, and referral to an eye care provider is recommended. The clinical examination should also include an assessment of the lymph nodes (swollen submandibular and preauricular lymph nodes). Lymphadenopathy, such as an enlarged, tender preauricular lymph node, is more common in viral versus bacterial conjunctivitis.

The physical eye examination should inspect for visual acuity, discharge type, corneal opacity, abnormal pupil size or shape, eyelid swelling, and orbit protrusion or asymmetry. Referral to an ophthalmologist or eye care professional should be performed immediately for cases that involve visual loss, moderate to severe pain, severe purulent discharge, or any corneal involvement. Useful information can be obtained with a simple penlight in the absence of a slit lamp, especially as it pertains to measurement of the anterior chamber depth and the ruling out of angle closure. Viral conjunctivitis can vary in presentation, but tearing, clear to white discharge, redness, and bilaterality are very common. Viral conjunctivitis usually starts with one eye, with the second eye to follow within a few days. Bacterial conjunctivitis is strongly suggested by glued eyelids, lack of itching, and lack of history of conjunctivitis. A diagnostic index for bacterial conjunctivitis by van Weert et al suggests that younger adult patients with conjunctivitis who present without glued eyelids at awakening are less likely to have conjunctivitis with a bacterial origin; this risk increases with age and presentation of two glued eyes.

A slit lamp provides a more detailed appearance of the conjunctival epithelium that enables differentiation between various types of conjunctival inflammation (follicular, mainly infectious; papillary, mainly allergic; pseudomembranous, severe EKC; eosinophilic, allergic). Fluorescein staining in conjunction with slit lamp examination, highlights patterns of corneal fluorescein uptake and exposes anterior chamber inflammation.HSV infection typically appears as branching lesions with intensely stained end bulbs, while highly branched lesions without end bulbs are typical of VZV infection.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^5a034024]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis — presentation, common etiologies, and testing considerations are outlined. Conjunctivitis is characterized by a "red eye" (ie, significant conjunctival hyperemia) over the bulbar conjunctiva and/or palpebral/tarsal conjunctiva often associated with irritation and discharge. Diagnostic testing is rarely indicated given characteristic clinical presentations. Viral conjunctivitis is most commonly bilateral with serous, watery discharge and known sick contacts, allergic conjunctivitis is uniformly bilateral with watery discharge and grayish, scant, stringy mucus with an associated situational atopy history, and bacterial conjunctivitis is typically unilateral with more purulent discharge, matting and adherence of eyelids on waking. Adenovirus is the most common cause of viral conjunctivitis (34%–80%). In adults, S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae are the most frequent causes of bacterial conjunctivitis, whereas H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and Moraxella spp. are most common in children. C. trachomatis is associated with neonatal and sexually transmitted conjunctivitis in developed nations and is the leading cause of infectious blindness (trachoma) in developing nations. N. gonorrhoeae conjunctivitis is a rapidly progressive medical emergency; high-risk individuals include neonates, infants, and sexually active adults, and to mitigate rapid ocular damage every effort should be made for Gram stains from ocular specimens to be reported in < 1 hour. Neonatal conjunctivitis is also caused by HSV inoculated at the time of vaginal delivery and although rare, P. aeruginosa can cause life-threatening neonatal conjunctivitis in hospitalized infants.

### Topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers for treating seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis [^b10a3cdf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Seasonal/perennial allergic conjunctivitis is the most common allergic conjunctivitis, usually with acute manifestations when a person is exposed to allergens and with typical signs and symptoms including itching, redness, and tearing. The clinical signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis are mediated by the release of histamine by mast cells. Histamine antagonists (also called antihistamines) inhibit the action of histamine by blocking histamine H1 receptors, antagonising the vasoconstrictor, and to a lesser extent, the vasodilator effects of histamine. Mast cell stabilisers inhibit degranulation and consequently the release of histamine by interrupting the normal chain of intracellular signals. Topical treatments include eye drops with antihistamines, mast cell stabilisers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, combinations of the previous treatments, and corticosteroids. Standard treatment is based on topical antihistamines alone or topical mast cell stabilisers alone or a combination of treatments. There is clinical uncertainty about the relative efficacy and safety of topical treatment.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers, alone or in combination, for use in treating seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2014, Issue 7), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to July 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2014), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 17 July 2014. We also searched the reference lists of review articles and relevant trial reports for details of further relevant publications.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing topical antihistamine and mast cell stabilisers, alone or in combination, with placebo, no treatment or to any other antihistamine or mast cell stabiliser, or both, that examined people with seasonal or perennial allergic conjunctivitis, or both. The primary outcome was any participant-reported evaluation (by questionnaire) of severity of four main ocular symptoms: itching, irritation, watering eye (tearing), and photophobia (dislike of light), both separately and, if possible, by an overall symptom score. We considered any follow-up time between one week and one year.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Disagreements were resolved by discussion among review authors and the involvement of a third review author. We followed standard methodological approaches used by Cochrane.

Main Results

We identified 30 trials with a total of 4344 participants randomised, with 17 different drugs or treatment comparisons. The following antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers were evaluated in at least one RCT: nedocromil sodium or sodium cromoglycate, olopatadine, ketotifen, azelastine, emedastine, levocabastine (or levocabastine), mequitazine, bepotastine besilate, combination of antazoline and tetryzoline, combination of levocabastine and pemirolast potassium. The most common comparison was azelastine versus placebo (nine studies). We observed a large variability in reporting outcomes. The quality of the studies and reporting was variable, but overall the risk of bias was low. Trials evaluated only short-term effects, with a range of treatment of one to eight weeks. Meta-analysis was only possible in one comparison (olopatadine versus ketotifen). There was some evidence to support that topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers reduce symptoms and signs of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis when compared with placebo. There were no reported serious adverse events related to the use of topical antihistamine and mast cell stabilisers treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

It seems that all reported topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers reduce symptoms and signs of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis when compared with placebo in the short term. However, there is no long-term data on their efficacy. Direct comparisons of different antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers need to be interpreted with caution. Overall, topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers appear to be safe and well tolerated. We observed a large variability in outcomes reported. Poor quality of reporting challenged the synthesis of evidence.

### Alleviation of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms in participants treated with a 0.005% tacrolimus eye-drop solution [^a4663af5]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 4
Time course of baseline-adjusted mean TOSS, FAS, high-dose group, day 1 (left panel) and day 8 (right panel). Day 1: n = 31 for placebo, n = 32 for Tacrosolv. Day 8: n = 31 for both groups. Error bars indicate SEM; ✱ p ≤ 0.05.

When expressing day 8 mean TOSS as a percentage of day 1 mean TOSS, it became obvious that only high-dose Tacrosolv treatment led to a significantly reduced TOSS on day 8 compared to day 1 (Figure 5). In contrast, there was no difference in mean TOSS between day 1 and day 8 in the placebo group (Figure 5).

Time courses of individual TOSS symptoms (itching, redness, watery eyes, gritty feeling) on day 8 were analyzed post hoc. As shown in Figure 6, treatment with Tacrosolv impacted the three main ocular symptoms associated with allergic conjunctivitis: itchy eyes, redness, and watery eyes. The difference in redness and watery eyes in favor of Tacrosolv became statistically significant towards the end of the allergen exposure. "Gritty feeling" did not contribute to the effect of Tacrosolv on cumulative TOSS.

Figure 5
Mean TOSS percentage (0–4 hours) on day 8 compared to day 1 (100%) for FAS, high-dose group. Error bars indicate SEM. p ≤ 0.01, assessed by one-sample Wilcoxon test (placebo) and one-sample t -test (Tacrosolv).

Interestingly, Tacrosolv treatment benefited not only ocular but also nasal symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. Figure 7 shows differences in mean TNSS between high-dose Tacrosolv and placebo on day 1 and day 8. On both days, the difference was in favor of Tacrosolv, with p = 0.061 on day 1 and p = 0.034 on day 8.

### Virtual consultation for red eye [^a649eaab]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

What you should do

Recognising when to refer patients with a red eye to ophthalmology services, whether it is routine or urgently, is crucial (box 4). Figure 1 represents possible diagnoses to consider based on initial assessment.

Box 4
Conditions that require urgent referral to an ophthalmologist

Severe "conjunctivitis" that does not improve after several days of antibiotic treatment ("bacterial conjunctivitis") or lubricants ("viral conjunctivitis")
Corneal infection (especially in contact lens wearers)
Anterior uveitis
Acute angle-closure glaucoma
Endophthalmitis (suspect if the patient had intra-ocular surgery within the past week)
Ocular trauma (including mechanical, chemical, and thermal injury)
Scleritis
Orbital cellulitis

Patients with non-sight threatening red eye conditions — such as mild infectious or non-infectious conjunctivitis, subconjunctival haemorrhage, or mild corneal abrasion — can be reassured and managed in the community. Advise that most cases of acute viral and bacterial conjunctivitis will resolve without any treatment in 5–7 days. A trial of topical antibiotics (such as chloramphenicol or fusidic acid) can be started if symptoms are not resolving within three days of onset in bacterial conjunctivitis. If the condition does not improve or if it worsens after treatment, offer referral to an eye casualty unit for urgent ophthalmic assessment.

Suspected severe and potentially sight threatening conditions (box 4) or the presence of red flags (see box 1) warrant prompt ophthalmology referral. Patients with recurrent history of red eye related conditions warrant a face-to-face ophthalmology review. Ocular signs could be too subtle to be picked up by mobile imaging. Contact the local on-call ophthalmology team immediately for these patients.

Education into practice

Recollect a patient with an eye condition you examined recently. What would you do differently based on reading this article?
What red flags would you look for in a patient with red eye that would prompt an ophthalmology referral?

How patients were involved in the creation of this article

Recent examples of patients with a red eye who had been assessed by virtual consultation, including telephone or video consultation, have informed the writing of this article. In addition, images of patients with red eyes taken during virtual consultations have been used after obtaining informed consent. We are grateful for their contribution.

### The effect of ketotifen on inflammatory markers in allergic conjunctivitis: an open, uncontrolled study [^b4bc334a]. BMC Ophthalmology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy and safety of ketotifen eye drop treatment in allergic conjunctivitis (AC) management is perfectly known by several studies, but the mechanism of action at the biochemical levels is poorly understood so we decided to perform an open, uncontrolled study in order to investigate the effect of the topical administration of ketotifen fumarate 0.05% on biochemical markers of inflammation on conjunctival cells in patients with AC.

Methods

Nineteen patients with symptoms and signs of AC (itching, discharge, burning, redness, increase in the watery discharge, swelling and follicles) and with a history of allergy were prescribed with two daily instillation of one drop of eyewash ketotifen fumarate 0,05% in both eyes during thirty days. They were studied by measuring clinical and immunologic parameters.

Results

Ketotifen fumarate treatment significantly reduced the total symptoms and signs score for each patient as well as each symptoms and signs at all time points compared with day 0 (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.016, respectively). Although the percentage of HLA-DR+ epithelial cells diminished only in 58% of patients, the numbers of CD29+ and eotaxin+ epithelial cells dropped significantly in 68% and 73% of them (p < 0.0062 and < 0.0082, respectively) as a consequence of the treatment. In 9 out of 19 patients a simultaneous decrease in the percentage of epithelial cells positive for CD29 and eotaxin was observed.

Conclusion

Ketotifen besides the well-known effect in reducing signs and symptoms of AC significantly diminished production of eotaxin and expression of CD29 by epithelial cells in patients with seasonal AC.

### Interventions for chronic blepharitis [^b2dfc423]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Blepharitis, an inflammatory condition associated with itchiness, redness, flaking, and crusting of the eyelids, is a common eye condition that affects both children and adults. It is common in all ethnic groups and across all ages. Although infrequent, blepharitis can lead to permanent alterations to the eyelid margin or vision loss from superficial keratopathy (abnormality of the cornea), corneal neovascularization, and ulceration. Most importantly, blepharitis frequently causes significant ocular symptoms such as burning sensation, irritation, tearing, and red eyes as well as visual problems such as photophobia and blurred vision. The exact etiopathogenesis is unknown, but suspected to be multifactorial, including chronic low-grade infections of the ocular surface with bacteria, infestations with certain parasites such as demodex, and inflammatory skin conditions such as atopy and seborrhea. Blepharitis can be categorized in several different ways. First, categorization is based on the length of disease process: acute or chronic blepharitis. Second, categorization is based on the anatomical location of disease: anterior, or front of the eye (e.g. staphylococcal and seborrheic blepharitis), and posterior, or back of the eye (e.g. meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD)). This review focuses on chronic blepharitis and stratifies anterior and posterior blepharitis.

Objectives

To examine the effectiveness of interventions in the treatment of chronic blepharitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1950 to February 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to February 2012), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We searched the reference lists of included studies for any additional studies not identified by the electronic searches. There were no date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. The electronic databases were last searched on 9 February 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomized controlled trials (CCTs) in which participants were adults aged 16 years or older and clinically diagnosed with chronic blepharitis. We also included trials where participants with chronic blepharitis were a subset of the participants included in the study and data were reported separately for these participants. Interventions within the scope of this review included medical treatment and lid hygiene measures.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed search results, reviewed full-text copies for eligibility, examined risk of bias, and extracted data. Data were meta-analyzed for studies comparing similar interventions and reporting comparable outcomes with the same timing. Otherwise, results for included studies were summarized in the text.

Main Results

There were 34 studies (2169 participants with blepharitis) included in this review: 20 studies (14 RCTs and 6 CCTs) included 1661 participants with anterior or mixed blepharitis and 14 studies (12 RCTs and 2 CCTs) included 508 participants with posterior blepharitis (MGD). Due to the heterogeneity of study characteristics among the included studies, with respect to follow-up periods and types of interventions, comparisons, and condition of participants, our ability to perform meta-analyses was limited. Topical antibiotics were shown to provide some symptomatic relief and were effective in eradicating bacteria from the eyelid margin for anterior blepharitis. Lid hygiene may provide symptomatic relief for anterior and posterior blepharitis. The effectiveness of other treatments for blepharitis, such as topical steroids and oral antibiotics, were inconclusive.

Authors' Conclusions

Despite identifying 34 trials related to treatments for blepharitis, there is no strong evidence for any of the treatments in terms of curing chronic blepharitis. Commercial products are marketed to consumers and prescribed to patients without substantial evidence of effectiveness. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of such treatments. Any RCT designed for this purpose should separate participants by type of condition (e.g. staphylococcal blepharitis or MGD) in order to minimize imbalances between groups (type I errors) and to achieve statistical power for analyses (prevent type II errors). Medical interventions and commercial products should be compared with conventional lid hygiene measures, such as warm compresses and eyelid margin washing, to determine effectiveness, as well as head-to-head to show comparative effectiveness between treatments. Outcomes of interest should be patient-centered and measured using validated questionnaires or scales. It is important that participants be followed long-term, at least one year, to assess chronic outcomes properly.

### Evaluation of a community-based participatory farmworker eye health intervention in the "black dirt" region of New York state [^8c1316b5]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Eye irritation is a constant hazard for migrant and seasonal farmworkers, but there are few studies of the problem or how to address it. Researchers evaluated the effect of a community-based participatory eye health intervention on farmworker eye symptoms in the Hudson Valley, NY.

Methods

A randomized pre-post intervention with 2, 4-week follow-up periods was implemented with a sample of 97 farmworkers. Five eye symptoms were measured, along with utilization of protective eyewear and eye drops.

Results

Leading baseline eye symptoms were redness (49%), blurred vision (43%), itching (43%), and eye pain (29%). Significant reductions in eye pain (P = 0.009), and non-significant reductions in redness were observed for the intervention group while controls experienced increases in both.

Conclusions

The intervention was effective in significantly reducing eye pain, and to a lesser extent, redness. Future eyewear promotion programs should offer a range of eye wear, tailor offerings to local climate and tasks, evaluate eyewear durability, and include eye drops.

### Allergic conjunctivitis: update on pathophysiology and prospects for future treatment [^e2760d01]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Allergic conjunctivitis is in actuality a group of diseases affecting the ocular surface and is usually associated with type 1 hypersensitivity reactions. Two acute disorders, seasonal allergic conjunctivitis and perennial allergic conjunctivitis, exist, as do 3 chronic diseases, vernal keratoconjunctivitis, atopic keratoconjunctivitis, and giant papillary conjunctivitis. The ocular surface inflammation (usually mast cell driven) results in itching, tearing, lid and conjunctival edema-redness, and photophobia during the acute phase and can lead to a classic late-phase response (with associated eosinophilia and neutrophilia) in a subset of individuals. As is the case in other allergic diseases, a chronic disease can also develop, accompanied by remodeling of the ocular surface tissues. In severe cases the patient experiences extreme discomfort and sustains damage to the ocular surface. For such cases, there is no highly effective and safe treatment regimen. Topical administration of corticosteroids is used in severe cases but is associated with an increased risk for the development of cataracts and glaucoma. Thus there is a worldwide search for new biotargets for the treatment of these diseases. Here we provide a brief update of the clinical symptoms associated with these diseases, the rationale for disease classification, recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of the diseases, and an update on both preclinical and clinical advances toward refined therapies for these diseases.

### Itch in the era of COVID-19 pandemic: an unfolding scenario [^c79d6ca2]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2, that broke out in December 2019. In just 4 months it has spread to almost every country in the world and up to April 18, 2020, the virus has infected more than two million people. Itch is the most common symptom in dermatology and a frequent one of systemic diseases. The association of itch and viral diseases has been widely documented; however, the actual prevalence of itch in the patients suffering from new the SARS-CoV-2 infection is still unknown. In this paper, we present a review of the available literature on the topic of itch in the affected population. Moreover, we have also analyzed different aspects of itch associated with COVID-19 pandemic, not directly related to the viral infection. Those included use of chemicals, hand sanitizers, common use of personal protective equipment and psychosocial stress.

Study examinations

Examinations were performed before and 1, 2, and 3 months after initiating diquafosol treatment in the order listed. Subjects were asked not to use eye drops for at least 2 hours before study visits to minimize the influence of eye drops on the tear lipid layer thickness (LLT). Immediately after the subjects arrived at our clinic, LLT was measured using the LipiView ocular surface interferometer (TearScience, Morrisville, NC, USA). One drop of diquafosol was then instilled in both eyes and LLT was measured again 20 minutes later.

Subjects completed a symptoms questionnaire (MGD questionnaire), which included rating the presence of 11 ocular symptoms using the following scoring system: 0 = never, 1 = rarely, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often, and 4 = all of the time. The rated symptoms included discomfort, pressure sensation, fatigue, discharge, stickiness, itching, heavy sensation, dryness, foreign body sensation, burning sensation, and redness. All 11 symptom scores were totaled to calculate the MGD symptom score. Subjects also completed a questionnaire to determine the dry eye-related quality of life score (DEQS). Medication use compliance was evaluated as 100%, 75%–99%, 25%–74%, or < 25%.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^7e08a7a9]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Guidelines and criteria for diagnosing and treating acute infectious conjunctivitis based on natural history and etiology are available. However, greater awareness of and adherence to differential diagnosis should be kept in mind to improve outcomes in patients presenting with suspected acute infectious conjunctivitis.

Epidemiology and Clinical Presentation

Discriminating features of viral, bacterial, and allergic acute conjunctivitis are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1
Discriminating Clinical Features of Suspected Acute Conjunctivitis

Viral Conjunctivitis

Adenoviruses are the cause of most (65–90%) cases of viral conjunctivitis, while the herpes simplex virus (HSV) is the cause of 1.3–4.8% of all cases of acute conjunctivitis. Other viruses that are associated with conjunctivitis include varicella (herpes) zoster virus (VZV) and Molluscum contagiosum.

Adenoviruses are nonenveloped viruses that are relatively resistant to disinfection. Adenoviral conjunctivitis is highly contagious, due in part to the capacity of the virus to survive in a desiccated state at room temperature for several weeks. Transmission risk is 10–50%, and the infection may spread via personal contact or indirectly through shared items. Adenoviral conjunctivitis is self-limiting, with improvement of signs and symptoms within 5–14 days. Often, the condition presents as unilateral in early phases and eventually spreads to both eyes.

Adenovirus serotypes are associated with different types of ocular infection, including pharyngoconjunctival fever and epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC; patient photos shown in Figure 1). Pharyngoconjunctivitis typically manifests bilaterally with fever and enlargement of the periauricular lymph nodes.EKC is more severe because of the adverse effect it can have on visual acuity; it is characterized by watery discharge, swelling, and redness, and involvement of lymph nodes on both sides of the neck.EKC is highly contagious, and asymptomatic patients who have contracted the disease may unknowingly spread the virus.

### Outpatient human coronavirus associated conjunctivitis in India [^52108b2e]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Viral conjunctivitis (pink eye) can be highly contagious and is of public health importance. There remains significant debate whether SARS-CoV-2 can present as a primary conjunctivitis. The aim of this study was to identify pathogens associated with outpatient infectious conjunctivitis during the COVID-19 Delta surge.

Methods

This prospective study was conducted in the spring and summer months of 2021. 106 patients with acute conjunctivitis who presented to the Aravind Eye Center in Madurai, India were included. One anterior nasal swab and one conjunctival swab of each eye were obtained for each enrolled patient. Samples were subsequently processed for unbiased metagenomic RNA deep sequencing (RNA-seq). Outcomes included clinical findings and codetection of other pathogens with SARS-CoV-2 in patients with conjunctivitis.

Results

Among the 13 patients identified with human coronavirus RNA fragments in their swabs, 6 patients had SARS-CoV-2 infection, 5 patients had coinfections of SARS-CoV-2 and human adenovirus (HAdV), 1 patient had a coinfection with human coronavirus OC43 and HAdV, and 1 patient had a coinfection of Vittaforma corneae and SARS-CoV-2. 30% had bilateral disease and symptoms on presentation. Petechial hemorrhage was noted in 33% of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. No patients with SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-2 and HAdV infections had subepithelial infiltrates on presentation. All patients denied systemic symptoms.

Conclusions

Among the patients presented with conjunctivitis associated with human coronavirus infection, over 50% of the patients had co-infections with other circulating pathogens, suggesting the public-health importance of broad pathogen testing and surveillance in the outpatient conjunctivitis population.

### A distinctive erythematous macular exanthem of the adult: a new entity? [^ae14cbcd]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Delineating a new exanthem is difficult. Atypical or modified types of already known conditions can easily be mistaken for new entities.

Objectives

To report 29 cases of an acute, self-limiting exanthem never described before.

Methods

Clinical description, serology, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and other laboratory investigations.

Results

The eruption starts with bright pink-red slightly oedematous macules symmetrically arranged on the trunk. The lesions tend to coalesce, and spread to the limbs on which they may acquire a marginated annular appearance. The lesions invariably spare the face (including oral mucous membranes), palms and soles. The eruption is pruritic and lasts 20–30 days, clearing spontaneously. The disease has a predilection for men aged 17–56 years and occurs mostly between spring and summer. Serological tests, PCR assays and investigations for bacteria, parasites or viruses were consistently negative.

Conclusions

The clinical picture does not recall any of the classical exanthems or their atypical forms.

### Red eyes and red-flags: improving ophthalmic assessment and referral in primary care [^3461b7ba]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Problem

Between two and five percent of all presentations to general practice are ophthalmic in nature. Red eye is the descriptive term representing inflammation of the anterior segment resulting in vasodilation of the superficial blood vessels, and is the most common ocular presentation in general practice. In most cases, the cause is benign. However, sometimes a red eye may indicate a sight-threatening, or in extreme cases, a life-threatening condition. According to the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE), the benign conditions include bacterial, viral, and allergic conjunctivitis, episcleritis, and subconjunctival haemorrhage. These make up about 70% of the primary care red eye consultations, and are subsequently over-diagnosed. The more common sight-threatening causes of a red eye include keratitis, scleritis, acute glaucoma, foreign body trauma, chemical burns, and orbital cellulitis. Studies have demonstrated that accurate diagnosis of eye conditions is achieved between 16% and 36% of the time, and up to 12% of those misdiagnosed experience adverse outcomes as a result.

In order to ensure that patients attending primary care services with a red eye are managed appropriately and safely, the NICE 'Red Eye' Clinical Knowledge Summary (CKS) specifies that the doctor must 'always document the history and findings of an eye examination (including negative findings). Pain, photophobia, visual acuity, and whether the condition is unilateral or bilateral, are the essential elements to be documented'. The clinician should refer the patient for same-day specialist assessment by an ophthalmologist if any red flag features are present.

The aim of this project was to ensure that an assessment for red-flag features was performed in every patient presenting to their GP with a red eye, and those with red-flag features were appropriately referred to same-day ophthalmology services, as recommended by NICE in the 'Red Eye' CKS. The timeframe within which improvement was to be demonstrated was initially set at eight weeks. The setting was a primary care health centre, located in Tower Hamlets, serving a local population of over 13,000 patients.
