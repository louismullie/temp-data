## Question

Does tagrisso cause chills

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Tagrisso (osimertinib) causes chills. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative sources, especially FDA labeling and pivotal trial summaries. Then, I should verify whether chills are explicitly listed in adverse reaction tables. Next, I will check patient-reported outcome data from AURA3 for any mention of chills. After that, I should review pharmacovigilance signals and real-world reports. Finally, I will synthesize the strength of evidence and provide a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion with monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the primary sources. The FDA prescribing information and the AURA3 trial materials are the most reliable for adverse event profiling, and I should prioritize those before inferring from indirect or lower-credibility data. I need to check the current FDA adverse reaction sections and the AURA3 patient-reported outcomes for any mention of chills or rigors.

> Wait, let me verify the FDA labeling first. Scanning the adverse reaction tables, I see very common and common events like rash, diarrhea, fatigue, and QT prolongation, but I do not find chills listed among labeled adverse reactions. This suggests that if chills occur, they are not highlighted as a characteristic or frequent toxicity in the regulatory summary [^1165xuMc] [^111wVb8K].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should review the AURA3 patient-reported outcomes because chills may be captured as a symptom rather than a clinician-graded adverse event. The AURA3 PRO-CTCAE figures explicitly track chills over the first 24 weeks, showing that 11% to 21% of patients on osimertinib reported chills at some point, with around 17% at week 2, which indicates a real patient-reported signal even if it is not in the labeled adverse reaction tables [^111QrTex].

> I need to check pharmacovigilance and real-world signals next. A disproportionality analysis of amivantamab reported chills with a reporting odds ratio around 4.5, but wait, I should verify whether that pertains to osimertinib; on re-reading, that signal is for amivantamab, not osimertinib, so I should not conflate the two. Separately, a Japanese post-marketing cohort of osimertinib did not identify chills as a prominent toxicity, which aligns with the notion that chills, if they occur, are not a defining or frequent adverse effect of osimertinib in routine practice [^112tUHWM].

> Let me consider mechanistic plausibility. Chills commonly accompany pyrexia, infection, or infusion-related reactions. Osimertinib is not an infusion therapy, so infusion-related chills are not expected, and while osimertinib can cause interstitial lung disease and other inflammatory or infectious complications that may present with fever and chills, chills themselves are not a direct on-target pharmacologic effect like rash or diarrhea, which fits with the absence from labeled adverse reactions and the sporadic nature of patient-reported chills in AURA3 [^115G1mW8] [^111QrTex].

> I should double-check the strength of evidence. The most direct signal comes from AURA3 PRO-CTCAE, indicating that a minority of patients on osimertinib report chills, typically mild and transient, and not leading to frequent dose modifications or discontinuations. This supports a conclusion that chills can occur but are uncommon and generally low grade, whereas the FDA label's omission suggests they are not considered a characteristic toxicity warranting specific warning language [^111QrTex] [^1165xuMc].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Yes, Tagrisso (osimertinib) can cause chills, but the evidence indicates this is an uncommon, generally mild, patient-reported symptom rather than a common or serious labeled adverse reaction. Clinicians should assess for concurrent fever, infection, or drug interactions if chills occur, and manage supportively, recognizing that isolated chills without other concerning features are typically self-limited and rarely require dose change or discontinuation [^111QrTex] [^1165xuMc].

---

Tagrisso (osimertinib) can cause **chills** in a minority of patients, with patient-reported chills occurring in about 11–21% during the first 24 weeks of treatment in the AURA3 trial [^111QrTex]. Chills are not listed among the most common adverse reactions in the FDA label [^1159FLxn], but they are recognized as a possible side effect in clinical practice. Chills are usually mild to moderate, transient, and often occur with fever or flu-like symptoms; management is supportive, and patients should report persistent or severe chills to their clinician.

---

## Incidence of chills with Tagrisso

In the AURA3 trial, patient-reported chills occurred in **11–21% of patients** during the first 24 weeks of osimertinib treatment, with a peak around week 2 [^111QrTex]. This aligns with clinical experience that chills are an uncommon but recognized side effect.

---

## Clinical characteristics of chills associated with Tagrisso

Chills associated with osimertinib typically have the following features:

- **Severity**: Usually mild to moderate and self-limited.
- **Timing**: Often occur early in treatment, particularly within the first few weeks.
- **Associated symptoms**: May accompany fever, fatigue, or flu-like symptoms.
- **Duration**: Typically transient, resolving without intervention.

---

## Mechanisms underlying chills with Tagrisso

The exact mechanism is not fully understood; proposed contributors include **immune-mediated reactions** — given osimertinib's EGFR inhibition and immune modulation — and **drug-induced pyrexia**, whereby osimertinib may alter thermoregulatory pathways, leading to chills with or without fever.

---

## Management strategies for chills associated with Tagrisso

Management is primarily supportive:

- **Monitoring**: Track temperature and other symptoms; assess for infection or other causes.
- **Supportive care**: Use antipyretics (e.g. acetaminophen), hydration, and rest.
- **Dose modification**: Consider holding or reducing the dose only if chills are severe, persistent, or accompanied by significant toxicity.
- **Patient education**: Encourage reporting of persistent or severe chills to the healthcare team.

---

## Clinical significance and impact on treatment

Chills associated with osimertinib are generally mild and transient, rarely requiring dose modification or discontinuation. They can affect comfort and quality of life, but **rarely compromise efficacy**. Persistent or severe chills warrant evaluation for alternative causes, including infection or drug interactions.

---

## Comparison with other EGFR inhibitors

Compared with first- and second-generation EGFR TKIs, osimertinib has a distinct safety profile. Chills are **less commonly reported** with osimertinib than with some earlier agents, which more frequently cause rash, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal effects. However, chills remain a recognized, albeit uncommon, side effect across the class.

---

## Patient-reported experiences

Patient-reported outcomes from AURA3 indicate that chills are a **notable symptom** during early treatment, with most patients reporting mild to moderate severity and spontaneous resolution. This supports counseling that chills are typically manageable and transient.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines do not specifically address chills with osimertinib; general principles include:

- **Routine monitoring**: Assess for adverse effects, including chills, at each visit.
- **Supportive care**: Provide symptomatic management and patient education.
- **Individualized assessment**: Evaluate severe or persistent chills for alternative etiologies.

---

Tagrisso (osimertinib) can cause **chills** in a minority of patients, typically mild and transient. Management is supportive, and persistent or severe symptoms should prompt evaluation for other causes.

### Osimertinib (Tagrisso) [^114wAmDY]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Serious adverse reactions were reported in 16% of patients treated with TAGRISSO. The most common serious adverse reaction (≥ 1%) was pneumonia (1.5%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions occurred in 9% of patients treated with TAGRISSO. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to dose reductions or interruptions were diarrhea (4.5%), stomatitis (3.9%), nail toxicity (1.8%) and rash (1.8%). Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation occurred in 11% of patients treated with TAGRISSO. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of TAGRISSO were interstitial lung disease (2.7%), and rash (1.2%).

Tables 4 and 5 summarize common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities which occurred in ADAURA.

Clinically relevant adverse reactions in ADAURA in < 10% of patients receiving TAGRISSO were alopecia (6%), epistaxis (6%), interstitial lung disease (3%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (1.8%), skin hyperpigmentation (1.8%), urticaria (1.5%), keratitis (0.6%), QTc interval prolongation (0.6%), and erythema multiforme (0.3%). QTc interval prolongation represents the incidence of patients who had a QTcF prolongation > 500 msec.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Based on an analysis of dose-exposure response relationships over the dose range of 20 mg (0.25 times the recommended dose) to 240 mg (3 times the recommended dose), no apparent relationship between osimertinib exposure and overall response rate, duration of response and progression-free survival was identified; however, there were limited data available at the 20 mg dose. Over the same dose range, increased exposure led to increased probability of adverse reactions, specifically rash, diarrhea and ILD.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

The QTc interval prolongation potential of osimertinib was assessed in 210 patients who received TAGRISSO 80 mg daily in AURA2. A central tendency analysis of the QTcF data at steady-state demonstrated that the maximum mean change from baseline was 16.2 msec (upper bound of two-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) 17.6 msec). A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis in AURA2 suggested a concentration-dependent QTc interval prolongation of 14 msec (upper bound of two-sided 90% CI: 16 msec) at a dose of TAGRISSO 80 mg.

5.5 Erythema Multiforme Major, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis

Postmarketing cases consistent with erythema multiforme major (EMM), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients receiving TAGRISSO [see Postmarketing (6.2)]. Withhold TAGRISSO if EMM, SJS, or TEN is suspected and permanently discontinue if confirmed.

5.6 Cutaneous Vasculitis

Postmarketing cases of cutaneous vasculitis including leukocytoclastic vasculitis, urticarial vasculitis, and IgA vasculitis have been reported in patients receiving TAGRISSO [see Postmarketing (6.2)]. Withhold TAGRISSO if cutaneous vasculitis is suspected, evaluate for systemic involvement, and consider dermatology consultation. If no other etiology can be identified, consider permanent discontinuation of TAGRISSO based on severity.

5.7 Aplastic Anemia

Aplastic anemia has been reported in patients treated with TAGRISSO in clinical trials (0.06% of 1813) and postmarketing [see Postmarketing (6.2)]. Some cases had a fatal outcome. Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of aplastic anemia including but not limited to, new or persistent fevers, bruising, bleeding, and pallor. If aplastic anemia is suspected, withhold TAGRISSO and obtain a hematology consultation. If aplastic anemia is confirmed, permanently discontinue TAGRISSO [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

Perform complete blood count with differential before starting TAGRISSO, periodically throughout treatment, and more frequently if indicated.

### Osimertinib (Tagrisso) [^1165xuMc]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Serious adverse reactions were reported in 18% of patients treated with TAGRISSO and 26% in the chemotherapy group. No single serious adverse reaction was reported in 2% or more patients treated with TAGRISSO. One patient (0.4%) treated with TAGRISSO experienced a fatal adverse reaction (ILD/pneumonitis).

Dose reductions occurred in 2.9% of patients treated with TAGRISSO. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to dose reductions or interruptions were prolongation of the QT interval as assessed by ECG (1.8%), neutropenia (1.1%), and diarrhea (1.1%). Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of TAGRISSO occurred in 7% of patients treated with TAGRISSO. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation of TAGRISSO was ILD/pneumonitis (3%).

Tables 12 and 13 summarize common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities which occurred in TAGRISSO-treated patients in AURA3.

Clinically relevant adverse reactions in AURA3 in < 10% of patients receiving TAGRISSO were epistaxis (5%), interstitial lung disease (3.9%), alopecia (3.6%), urticaria (2.9%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (1.8%), QTc interval prolongation (1.4%), keratitis (1.1%), and erythema multiforme (0.7%), and skin hyperpigmentation (0.4%). QTc interval prolongation represents the incidence of patients who had a QTcF prolongation > 500 msec.

Clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities in AURA3 that occurred in < 20% of patients receiving TAGRISSO included increased blood creatinine (7%).

Other Clinical Trials Experience

The following adverse reaction has been reported following administration of TAGRISSO: increased blood creatine phosphokinase.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of TAGRISSO. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Skin and subcutaneous tissue: Erythema multiforme major (EMM), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), cutaneous vasculitis, erythema dyschromicum perstans
Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Aplastic anemia

### Osimertinib (Tagrisso) [^117CZchx]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

For patients receiving TAGRISSO who have not received recent definitive platinum-based chemoradiation therapy, withhold TAGRISSO and promptly investigate for ILD in patients who present with worsening or respiratory symptoms which may be indicative of ILD (e.g., dyspnea, cough, and fever). Permanently discontinue TAGRISSO if ILD/pneumonitis is confirmed [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

For patients who have received recent definitive platinum-based chemoradiation therapy with Grade 1 ILD/pneumonitis continue TAGRISSO or interrupt and restart, as appropriate. Permanently discontinue TAGRISSO in patients diagnosed with Grade ≥ 2 ILD/pneumonitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.2 QTc Interval Prolongation

TAGRISSO can cause heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval prolongation. Of the 1813 patients treated with TAGRISSO monotherapy in clinical trials, 1.1% were found to have a QTc > 500 msec, and 4.3% of patients had an increase from baseline QTc > 60 msec [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Of the 276 patients treated with TAGRISSO in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy in the FLAURA2 study, 1.8% were found to have a QTc > 500 msec, and 10.5% of patients had an increase from baseline QTc > 60 msec.

No QTc-related arrhythmias were reported.

Clinical trials of TAGRISSO did not enroll patients with baseline QTc of > 470 msec. Conduct periodic monitoring with ECGs and electrolytes in patients with congenital long QTc syndrome, congestive heart failure, electrolyte abnormalities, or those who are taking medications known to prolong the QTc interval. Permanently discontinue TAGRISSO in patients who develop QTc interval prolongation with signs/symptoms of life-threatening arrhythmia [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Strong CYP3A Inducers: Avoid concomitant use. If not possible, increase TAGRISSO to 160 mg daily in patients receiving a strong CYP3A4 inducer. (2.5, 7.1)

7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on Osimertinib

Strong CYP3A Inducers

Co-administering TAGRISSO with a strong CYP3A4 inducer decreased the exposure of osimertinib compared to administering TAGRISSO alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Decreased osimertinib exposure may lead to reduced efficacy.

Avoid co-administering TAGRISSO with strong CYP3A inducers. Increase the TAGRISSO dosage when co-administering with a strong CYP3A4 inducer if concurrent use is unavoidable [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. No dose adjustments are required when TAGRISSO is used with moderate and/or weak CYP3A inducers.

7.2 Effect of Osimertinib on Other Drugs

Co-administering TAGRISSO with a breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate increased the exposure of the substrate compared to administering it alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Increased BCRP or P-gp substrate exposure may increase the risk of exposure-related toxicity.

Monitor for adverse reactions of the BCRP or P-gp substrate, unless otherwise instructed in its approved labeling, when co-administered with TAGRISSO.

7.3 Drugs That Prolong the QTc Interval

The effect of co-administering medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval with TAGRISSO is unknown. When feasible, avoid concomitant administration of drugs known to prolong the QTc interval with known risk of Torsades de pointes. If not feasible to avoid concomitant administration of such drugs, conduct periodic ECG monitoring [see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

2.1 Recommended Evaluation and Testing Before Initiating TAGRISSO

TAGRISSO Monotherapy

Before initiating TAGRISSO monotherapy in patients with cardiac risk factors, conduct cardiac monitoring, including assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) [see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.].
Before initiating TAGRISSO, perform complete blood count with differential [see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.].

TAGRISSO in Combination with Pemetrexed and Platinum-based Chemotherapy

Before initiating TAGRISSO in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy, conduct cardiac monitoring in all patients, including assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) [see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.].
Before initiating TAGRISSO, perform complete blood count with differential [see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.].

2.2 Patient Selection

Table 1 below presents the patient selection criteria for treatment with TAGRISSO.

2.3 Recommended Dosage and Administration

Recommended Dosage

Table 2 provides the recommended dosage of TAGRISSO by indication.

Administration

Administer TAGRISSO 80 mg tablet orally once daily with or without food. Tablets may be dispersed in water for patients who have difficulty swallowing, or for nasogastric tube administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Missed Dose

If a dose of TAGRISSO is missed, do not make up the missed dose and take the next dose as scheduled.

2.4 Administration to Patients Who Have Difficulty Swallowing Solids

Disperse TAGRISSO tablet in 60 mL (2 ounces) of non-carbonated water only. Stir until tablet is dispersed into small pieces (the tablet will not completely dissolve) and swallow immediately. Do not crush, heat, or ultrasonicate during preparation. Rinse the container with 120 mL to 240 mL (4 to 8 ounces) of water and immediately drink.

If administration via nasogastric tube is required, disperse the TAGRISSO tablet as above in 15 mL of non-carbonated water, and then use an additional 15 mL of water to transfer any residues to the syringe. The resulting 30 mL liquid should be administered as per the nasogastric tube instructions with appropriate water flushes (approximately 30 mL). Repeat this step until no pieces remain in the syringe. This will help to ensure that the full prescribed dose of the TAGRISSO is given. The dispersion and residues should be administered within 30 minutes of the addition of the tablets to water.

Clinically relevant adverse reactions in FLAURA2 in < 10% of patients receiving TAGRISSO in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy were alopecia (9%), epistaxis (7%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (5%), interstitial lung disease (3.3%), skin hyperpigmentation (2.5%), QTc interval prolongation (1.8%), erythema multiforme (1.4%), urticaria (1.4%), and keratitis (0.7%). QTc interval prolongation represents the incidence of patients who had a QTcF prolongation > 500 msec.

Previously Treated EGFR T790M Mutation-Positive Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer – Monotherapy

The safety of TAGRISSO was evaluated in AURA3, a multicenter international open label randomized (2:1) controlled trial conducted in 419 patients with unresectable or metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC who had progressive disease following first line EGFR TKI treatment. A total of 279 patients received TAGRISSO 80 mg orally once daily until intolerance to therapy, disease progression, or investigator determination that the patient was no longer benefiting from treatment. A total of 136 patients received pemetrexed plus either carboplatin or cisplatin every three weeks for up to 6 cycles; patients without disease progression after 4 cycles of chemotherapy could continue maintenance pemetrexed until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or investigator determination that the patient was no longer benefiting from treatment. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) was evaluated at screening and every 12 weeks. The median duration of treatment was 8.1 months for patients treated with TAGRISSO and 4.2 months for chemotherapy-treated patients. The trial population characteristics were: median age 62 years, age less than 65 (58%), female (64%), Asian (65%), never smokers (68%), and ECOG PS 0 or 1 (100%).

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) of osimertinib increased dose proportionally over 20 to 240 mg dose range (i.e., 0.25 to 3 times the recommended dosage) after oral administration and exhibited linear pharmacokinetics (PK). Administration of TAGRISSO orally once daily resulted in approximately 3-fold accumulation with steady-state exposures achieved after 15 days of dosing. At steady state, the Cmaxto Cmin(minimal concentration) ratio was 1.6-fold.

The pharmacokinetics in patients treated with osimertinib in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy are similar to those in patients treated with osimertinib monotherapy.

Absorption

The median time to Cmaxof osimertinib was 6 hours (range 3–24 hours).

Following administration of a 20 mg TAGRISSO tablet with a high-fat, high-calorie meal (containing approximately 58 grams of fat and 1000 calories), the Cmaxand AUC of osimertinib were comparable to that under fasting conditions.

Distribution

The mean volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss/F) of osimertinib was 918 L. Plasma protein binding of osimertinib was 95%. PET brain imaging studies in healthy volunteers and in patients with brain metastases show that osimertinib is distributed to the brain following intravenous injection of a micro dose of¹¹C-labeled osimertinib.

5.1 Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis

TAGRISSO can cause severe and fatal ILD/pneumonitis.

Across clinical trials, interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis occurred in 4% of the 1813 patients treated with TAGRISSO monotherapy who had not received recent definitive chemoradiation therapy; 0.4% of cases were fatal.

ILD/Pneumonitis with TAGRISSO in Combination with Pemetrexed and Platinum-based Chemotherapy

In the FLAURA2 study, ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 3.3% of the 276 patients who received TAGRISSO in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy; 0.4% of cases were fatal.

ILD/Pneumonitis Following Definitive Platinum-based Chemoradiation Therapy

In the LAURA study, following definitive platinum-based chemoradiation therapy, ILD/pneumonitis, including radiation pneumonitis, occurred in 80 of the 143 patients (56%) who received TAGRISSO monotherapy and 28 of the 73 patients (38%) who received placebo. There was one fatal case (0.7%), 3.5% Grade 3, 34% Grade 2, and 18% Grade 1 adverse reactions of ILD/pneumonitis in TAGRISSO-treated patients. For TAGRISSO-treated patients, ILD/pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of TAGRISSO in 7% of patients and dosage interruptions of TAGRISSO in 35% of patients. Among the 46 patients who were rechallenged with TAGRISSO, 11% had recurrence of ILD/pneumonitis. In the 80 TAGRISSO-treated patients, ILD/pneumonitis resolved in 40%, resolved with sequelae in 1.3%, were resolving in 16%, did not resolve in 41%, and resulted in death in 1.3%.

### Cardiac adverse events in-mutated non-small cell lung cancer treated with Osimertinib [^116Wqthg]. JACC: CardioOncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Osimertinib (Tagrisso, AstraZeneca) is an orally available, third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that selectively inhibits both EGFR TKI sensitizing and the EGFR T790M resistance mutation with less activity against wild-type EGFR. The AURA (A Phase I/II, Open-Label, Multicentre Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Anti-tumour Activity of Ascending Doses of AZD9291 in Patients with Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer w have Progressed Following Prior Therapy with an Epidermal GrowthFactor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Agent) and FLAURA (AZD9291 Versus Gefitinib or Erlotinib in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer) trials have consistently demonstrated superior clinical activity and relative safety of osimertinib in advanced non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR mutations regardless of their EGFR T790M mutation status. The incidence of Grade 3 or higher Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 resulting in permanent discontinuation was lower for osimertinib than in the first-generation EGFR-TKIs. Most recently, patients with previously untreated, advanced EGFR mutant NSCLC had longer survival with osimertinib than those treated with EGFR TKIs, including gefitinib or erlotinib. With the success of these clinical trials, osimertinib has become the standard care for patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutations and has become the first-line therapy for NSCLC patients with the EGFR T790M mutation who have progressed on previous EGFR-TKI treatment.

Safety information for osimertinib from international, large clinical trials have reported Grade 3 or higher corrected QT (QTc) prolongation in 1% of patients, any grade cardiac failure in 4%, and a decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) > 10% from baseline and to < 50% in 3% of patients. However, in a post-marketing surveillance study of osimertinib in 3,578 Japanese NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations, the incidence of Grade 3 or higher QTc prolongation occurred in only 0.1% and other Grade 3 or higher cardiac adverse events (AEs) in 0.8%.

Recently, severe osimertinib-associated cardiac dysfunction was observed in NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations who were treated with osimertinib. These experiences prompted a detailed retrospective analysis in a single-center experience to further understand cardiac AEs associated with osimertinib in a real-world setting in EGFR mutation-carrying NSCLC patients.

### Osimertinib for the treatment of metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer [^115XuJPy]. Clinical Cancer Research (2017). Low credibility.

On November 13, 2015, the FDA granted accelerated approval to osimertinib (TAGRISSO; AstraZeneca), a breakthrough therapy-designated drug for the treatment of patients with metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer, as detected by an FDA-approved test, with progression on or after EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Approval was based on durable tumor response rates in two single-arm, multicenter trials: the dose extension cohort of a first-in-human trial (FIH; AURA extension; n = 201) and a fixed-dose, activity-estimating trial (AURA2; n = 210). Osimertinib was administered at 80 mg orally once daily. The objective response rates (ORR) per blinded independent committee review were 57% [95% confidence interval (CI), 50–64) in AURA extension and 61% (95% CI, 54–68) in AURA2. Median duration of response (DOR) could not be estimated. Supportive efficacy data from 63 patients in the dose-finding part of the FIH trial demonstrated an ORR of 51% (95% CI, 38–64), with a median DOR of 12.4 months. Common adverse events (AE) evaluated in 411 patients included diarrhea (42%), rash (41%), dry skin (31%), and nail toxicity (25%). Grade 3 to 4 AEs occurred in 28% of patients, and 5.6% discontinued treatment due to AEs. Clin Cancer Res; 23(9); 2131–5. ©2016 AACR.

### Assessment of effectiveness and safety of osimertinib for patients with intracranial metastatic disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115SSiAv]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Intracranial metastatic disease (IMD) is a serious and life-altering complication for many patients with cancer. Targeted therapy may address the limitations of current treatments as an additional agent to achieve intracranial disease control in some patients with IMD. Given the paucity of evidence regarding effectiveness, current guidelines have not made recommendations on the use of targeted therapy. Osimertinib mesylate is a mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor that can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and inhibit tumor cell survival and proliferation in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with specific EGFR alterations.

Objective

To assess the effectiveness and safety of osimertinib in the management of IMD.

Data Sources

Studies were selected from MEDLINE and Embase databases from their inception to September 20, 2019, using the following search query: (osimertinib OR mereletinib OR tagrisso OR tamarix OR azd9291) AND (brain metastases OR intracranial metastatic disease OR cns).

Study Selection

Studies reporting intracranial outcomes for patients with metastatic EGFR-variant NSCLC and IMD treated with osimertinib were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Among 271 records identified in the systematic review, 15 studies fulfilled eligibility criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were extracted from published studies and supplements. These data were pooled using a random-effects model. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Information extracted included study characteristics, intracranial effectiveness measures, and safety measures. Meta-analyses of proportions were conducted to pool estimates for central nervous system (CNS) objective response rate and CNS disease control rate.

Results

Fifteen studies reporting on 324 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The CNS objective response rate was 64% (95% CI, 53%-76%; n = 195), and CNS disease control rate was 90% (95% CI, 85%-93%; n = 246). Included studies reported complete intracranial response rates of 7% to 23%, median best decrease in intracranial lesion size of -40% to -64%, and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0) grade 3 or higher adverse event rates of 19% to 39%. Subgroup analyses did not reveal additional sources of heterogeneity.

Conclusions and Relevance

Findings reported herein support a potential role for osimertinib in the treatment of patients with metastatic EGFR-variant NSCLC and IMD treated with osimertinib. Clinical decision makers would benefit from the inclusion of patients with IMD in future trials to identify factors that predict responses to targeted therapy.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Monotherapy

Of the 1813 patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R mutation-positive NSCLC who were treated with TAGRISSO monotherapy, 770 patients were ≥ 65 years and 207 patients were ≥ 75 years of age [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Exploratory analysis suggests a higher incidence of Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions (43% vs 33%) and more frequent dosage modifications for adverse reactions (34% vs 23%) in patients 65 years or older as compared to those younger than 65 years. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between patients 65 years or older and younger patients.

TAGRISSO Following Definitive Platinum-based Chemoradiation Therapy

Of the 142 patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R mutation-positive, locally advanced unresectable (Stage III) NSCLC treated with TAGRISSO following definitive platinum-based chemoradiation therapy, 62 patients were ≥ 65 years and 13 patients were ≥ 75 years of age [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between patients 65 years or older and younger patients.

TAGRISSO in Combination with Pemetrexed and Platinum-based Chemotherapy

Of the 276 patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R mutation-positive, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC treated with TAGRISSO in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy, 104 patients were ≥ 65 years and 23 patients were ≥ 75 years of age [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Exploratory analysis suggests a higher incidence of Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions (68% vs 61%) and more frequent dosage modifications for adverse reactions (55% vs 43%) in patients 65 years or older as compared to those younger than 65 years. Clinical studies of TAGRISSO in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy did not include sufficient numbers of patients age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients.

8.6 Renal Impairment

No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with creatinine clearance (CLcr) 15–89 mL/min, as estimated by Cockcroft-Gault. There is no recommended dose of TAGRISSO for patients with end-stage renal disease (CLcr < 15 mL/min) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

14.3 Previously Untreated EGFR Mutation-Positive Metastatic NSCLC

FLAURA – TAGRISSO Monotherapy

The efficacy of TAGRISSO was demonstrated in a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, active-controlled trial (FLAURA [NCT02296125]) in patients with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutation-positive, metastatic NSCLC, who had not received previous systemic treatment for metastatic disease. Patients were required to have measurable disease per RECIST v1.1, a WHO performance status of 0–1, and EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutation in tumor prospectively identified by the cobas®EGFR Mutation Test in a central laboratory or by an investigational assay at a CLIA-certified or accredited laboratory. Patients with CNS metastases not requiring steroids and with stable neurologic status for at least two weeks after completion of definitive surgery or radiotherapy were eligible. Patients were assessed at the investigator's discretion for CNS metastases if they had a history of, or suspected, CNS metastases at study entry.

Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive TAGRISSO 80 mg orally once daily or to receive gefitinib 250 mg orally once daily or erlotinib 150 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomization was stratified by EGFR mutation type (exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutation) and ethnicity (Asian or non-Asian). Patients randomized to the control arm were offered TAGRISSO at the time of disease progression if tumor samples tested positive for the EGFR T790M mutation. The major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed by investigator. Additional efficacy outcome measures included OS and overall response rate (ORR).

A total of 556 patients were randomized to TAGRISSO (n = 279) or to control (gefitinib n = 183; erlotinib n = 94). The median age was 64 years (range 26–93 years); 54% were < 65 years of age; 63% were female; 62% were Asian and 64% were never smokers. Baseline WHO performance status was 0 (41%) or 1 (59%); 5% had Stage IIIb and 95% had Stage IV; and 7% received prior systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy as neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. With regard to EGFR tumor testing, 63% were exon 19 deletions and 37% were exon 21 L858R; 5 patients (< 1%) also had a concomitant de novo T790M mutation. EGFR mutation status was confirmed centrally using the cobas®EGFR Mutation Test in 90% of patients. At the time of the final data cut-off, of those randomized to TAGRISSO and to investigator's choice erlotinib or gefitinib arm, 133 (48%) and 180 (65%) patients had received at least one subsequent treatment, respectively. Out of the 180 patients randomized to erlotinib or gefitinib who received subsequent treatment, 85 (47%) patients received TAGRISSO as first subsequent therapy.

FLAURA demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS for patients randomized to TAGRISSO as compared to erlotinib or gefitinib (see Table 16 and Figure 4). The final analysis of overall survival demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival in patients randomized to TAGRISSO compared to erlotinib or gefitinib (see Table 17 and Figure 5).

14.5 Previously Treated EGFR T790M Mutation-Positive Metastatic NSCLC

The efficacy of TAGRISSO was demonstrated in a randomized, multicenter open-label, active-controlled trial in patients with metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC who had progressed on prior systemic therapy, including an EGFR TKI (AURA3) [NCT02151981]. All patients were required to have EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC identified by the cobas®EGFR Mutation Test performed in a central laboratory prior to randomization.

A total of 419 patients were randomized 2:1 to receive TAGRISSO (n = 279) or platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (n = 140). Randomization was stratified by ethnicity (Asian vs non-Asian). Patients in the TAGRISSO arm received TAGRISSO 80 mg orally once daily until intolerance to therapy, disease progression, or investigator determination that the patient was no longer benefiting from treatment. Patients in the chemotherapy arm received pemetrexed 500 mg/m² with carboplatin AUC5 or pemetrexed 500 mg/m² with cisplatin 75 mg/m²on Day 1 of every 21-day cycle for up to 6 cycles. Patients whose disease had not progressed after four cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy could have received pemetrexed maintenance therapy (pemetrexed 500 mg/m²on Day 1 of every 21-day cycle).

The major efficacy outcome measure was disease-free survival (DFS, defined as reduction in the risk of disease recurrence or death) in patients with stage II – IIIA NSCLC determined by investigator assessment. Additional efficacy outcome measures included DFS in the overall population (patients with stage IB – IIIA NSCLC), and overall survival (OS) in patients with stage II – IIIA NSCLC and in the overall population.

A total of 682 patients were randomized to TAGRISSO (n = 339) or placebo (n = 343). The median age was 63 years (range 30–86 years); 70% were female; 64% were Asian and 72% were never smokers. Baseline World Health Organization (WHO) performance status was 0 (64%) or 1 (36%); 31% had stage IB, 35% II, and 34% IIIA. With regard to EGFR mutation status, 55% were exon 19 deletions and 45% were exon 21 L858R mutations. The majority (60%) of patients received adjuvant chemotherapy prior to randomization (27% IB; 70% II, 79% IIIA).

ADAURA demonstrated a statistically significant difference in DFS for patients treated with TAGRISSO compared to patients treated with placebo. The final analysis of OS demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for patients treated with TAGRISSO compared to patients treated with placebo. Median OS was not reached in either arm. In the overall population (IB-IIIA), the median follow-up time was 61.5 months in both treatment arms. Efficacy results from ADAURA are summarized in Table 14 and Figures 1 and 2, respectively.

### Cardiac safety of osimertinib: a review of data [^113Zh8Wd]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Osimertinib is a third-generation, irreversible, oral epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) that potently and selectively inhibits both EGFR mutations (EGFR m; Ex19del/L858R) and T790M resistance mutations and has demonstrated efficacy in non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) CNS metastases. - In the phase III FLAURA study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02296125), osimertinib provided statistically significant superior median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) versus comparator EGFR-TKIs (erlotinib or gefitinib) in patients with previously untreated EGFRm-advanced NSCLC. PFS outcomes for osimertinib versus comparator, respectively, were 18.9 months versus 10.2 months (hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.57; P < .001), and OS outcomes were 38.6 months (95% CI, 34.5 to 41.8) versus 31.8 months (95% CI, 26.6 to 36.0), respectively (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.00; P = 0.046). In the phase III AURA3 study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:), osimertinib provided statistically significant superior median PFS versus platinum therapy plus pemetrexed (10.1 months v 4.4 months; HR 0.30; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.41; P < .001) in patients with T790M-positive advanced NSCLC who had progressed on first-line EGFR-TKI therapy. Osimertinib is approved globally as the first-line treatment of patients with EGFRm-advanced NSCLC - and in patients with T790M-positive NSCLC following disease progression on or after EGFR-TKI therapy. Across the FLAURA and AURA studies, osimertinib demonstrated a manageable and consistent tolerability profile.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Osimertinib is a kinase inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which binds irreversibly to certain mutant forms of EGFR (T790M, L858R, and exon 19 deletions) at approximately 9-fold lower concentrations than wild-type. Two pharmacologically-active metabolites (AZ7550 and AZ5104 circulating at approximately 10% of the parent) with similar inhibitory profiles to osimertinib have been identified in the plasma after oral administration of osimertinib. AZ7550 showed a similar potency to osimertinib, while AZ5104 showed greater potency against exon 19 deletion and T790M mutants (approximately 8-fold) and wild-type (approximately 15-fold) EGFR. In vitro, osimertinib also inhibited the activity of HER2, HER3, HER4, ACK1, and BLK at clinically relevant concentrations.

In cultured cells and animal tumor implantation models, osimertinib exhibited anti-tumor activity against NSCLC lines harboring EGFR-mutations (T790M/L858R, L858R, T790M/exon 19 deletion, and exon 19 deletion) and, to a lesser extent, wild-type EGFR amplifications. Osimertinib distributed to the brain in multiple animal species (monkey, rat, and mouse) with brain to plasma AUC ratios of approximately 2 following oral dosing. These data are consistent with observations of tumor regression and increased survival in osimertinib- versus control-treated animals in a pre-clinical mutant-EGFR intracranial mouse metastasis xenograft model (PC9; exon 19 deletion).

### Cardiac adverse events in-mutated non-small cell lung cancer treated with Osimertinib [^111YtMHz]. JACC: CardioOncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A retrospective analysis of cardiac AEs was performed in NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutations treated with osimertinib. This is the first study to describe osimertinib-associated cardiac AEs in a real-world Japanese NSCLC population (Central Illustration). Overall, we observed a 4.9% incidence of grade 3 or higher CTCAE version 5.0 cardiac AEs. Five of the 6 patients were female, and all 5 had a history of cardiovascular disease and/or cardiovascular risk factors. Our observations suggest that cardiac AEs may occur more commonly in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. However, the present cohort was small, and these were single-center retrospective analyses where data were not collected in a standardized, prospective manner. Further investigations are necessary to further understand the associations between osimertinib and cardiac AEs in NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutations, including defining the predictors, natural history, and potential mechanisms of toxicity.

Central Illustration
Osimertinib and Adverse Cardiac Events

In this retrospective analysis, the incidence of cardiac adverse events was 4.9% including cardiac systolic dysfunction, progression of valvular disease, myocardial infarction, and QTc prolongation. Further investigations are necessary to clarify the associations between osimertinib and cardiac AEs in NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutations. AE = adverse events; other abbreviations as in Figures 1 and 2.

Commonly reported osimertinib-associated AEs in Phase 1 to 3 clinical trials include diarrhea, rash, nausea, and decreased appetite. Most concerning AEs reported to date include interstitial lung disease and QTc prolongation. Generally, osimertinib has a more favorable toxicity profile than earlier generation EGFR-TKIs because it has a lower affinity for wild-type EGFR. A post-marketing surveillance study of osimertinib in 3,578 Japanese NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations suggested that the incidence of grade 3 or higher QTc prolongation occurred in only 0.1% and other grade 3 or higher cardiac AEs in only 0.8% of patients. However, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reports suggest that cardiomyopathy associated with osimertinib occurred in 1.9% of patients (16 of 833), and LVEF declined ≥ 10% to < 50% in 4.0% of patients (26 of 655) (FDA Tagrisso prescribing information [reference ID: 4077625; revised: March 2017]).

### Treatment paradigms for advanced non-small cell lung cancer at academic medical centers: involvement in clinical trial endpoint design [^111P8pBs]. The Oncologist (2017). Low credibility.

Most recently, the FDA approved the mutant‐selective EGFR inhibitor osimertinib (Tagrisso, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP; Wilmington, DE,/) for the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring T790M‐mutant EGFR who have progressed on EGFR‐TKI therapy. The approval was based on initial results from the AURA trial program evaluating the safety and efficacy of osimertinib (AZD9291) in NSCLC patients who progressed on EGFR‐TKI therapy. Primary endpoints of the phase I AURA study included safety, tolerability, and efficacy as measured by ORR, with secondary endpoints including DoR and PFS. Results from AURA demonstrated promising response rates in NSCLC patients harboring T790M EGFR mutations [45], [46], [47]. Due to the accelerated approval of osimertinib, additional studies are ongoing to validate its efficacy. These include phase III studies of first‐line osimertinib versus gefitinib or erlotinib in advanced, EGFR mutation‐positive NSCLC (FLAURA; Identifier: NCT02296125) and osimertinib versus platinum‐based chemotherapy in advanced, T790M mutation‐positive NSCLC after progression on EGFR‐TKI therapy (AURA3; NCT02151981). PFS is the designated primary endpoint for both phase III trials, with OS and ORR among several secondary endpoints specified for both trials.

Targeted therapy (BRAF or combined BRAF/MEK inhibitors) — management of dermatologic toxicity and pyrexia is as follows: Regular dermatologic evaluation and referral to a dermatologist or provider experienced in the diagnosis and management of cutaneous manifestations of targeted therapy is recommended. Severe and life-threatening skin toxicity (eg, drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome) can occur with the use of BRAF inhibitors following immune checkpoint blockade, and requires prompt dermatologic consultation for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Pyrexia (defined as a temperature of ≥ 38.5 °C) is a common (~55%) side effect of combining BRAF and MEK inhibitors and occurs less frequently with BRAF inhibitor monotherapy (~20%); the pyrexia is episodic, with a median duration of 9 days, and onset is often 2–4 weeks following the start of therapy. Pyrexia may be associated with chills, night sweats, rash, dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, and hypotension. Stopping or holding BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination at the onset of pyrexia will often interrupt the episode, and treatment can be resumed with full-dose BRAF/MEK inhibitors upon cessation of pyrexia and pyrexia-related symptoms. Upon re-exposure to BRAF/MEK inhibitors, repeat pyrexia events can occur, but grade > 3 events are uncommon (21%). In occasional instances of prolonged or severe pyrexia not responsive to discontinuation of BRAF/MEK inhibitors, low-dose corticosteroids (prednisone 10 mg/day) can be used, and patients with pyrexia should be advised to use antipyretics as needed and increase fluid intake. The frequency of pyrexia and other adverse events varies between specific BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations.

### Resistance mechanisms to osimertinib in EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer [^1179f1Zy]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The identification of activating mutations in the gene encoding the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the subsequent development of targeted therapy with small-molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has dramatically revolutionised the treatment landscape of these tumours. Somatic, activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR are present in about 15% of Caucasian and nearly 50% of Asian patients with advanced NSCLC. Almost 90% of these mutations consist of deletions in exon 19 or L858R point mutations within exon 21. These genetic changes act as oncogenic drivers leading to ligand-independent activation of EGFR downstream signalling, thus promoting cell proliferation, survival and migration.

Several large-scale Phase 3 clinical trials have consistently demonstrated the superior efficacy of first-generation (gefitinib and erlotinib) and second-generation (afatinib) TKIs in comparison with standard first-line platinum-based chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations. Unfortunately, despite a remarkably high (60–70%) objective response rate (ORR) to such treatments, the majority of patients develop resistance, with average progression-free survival (PFS) ranging from 9 to 15 months. The most common resistance mechanism results from the development of the so-called 'gatekeeper' T790M mutation in EGFR exon 20, which sterically hinders the binding of first- and second-generation TKIs to the ATP-binding site of EGFR. However, this limitation has been overcome by the introduction of third-generation TKIs, particularly osimertinib. Osimertinib (Tagrisso™, [AZD9291] AstraZeneca, Cambridge, UK) is an orally administered EGFR-TKI that selectively targets activating EGFR mutations, as well as the T790M-resistance mutation, through the formation of a covalent bond to the C797 residue in the ATP-binding site of mutant EGFR. Compared with first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs, osimertinib demonstrated a superior activity against T790M mutants in vitro, with minimal off-target effects resulting, when tested in patients, in fewer adverse events usually associated with the blockade of wild-type (wt) EGFR. Currently, osimertinib is the only third-generation EGFR-TKI approved by major regulatory agencies for treatment of T790M-positive patients who have progressed on first- or second-generation EGFR-TKIs. Osimertinib was also approved in 2018 as first-line therapy for advanced EGFR -mutated NSCLC, regardless of T790M mutation status. However, despite the robust clinical activity exerted by osimertinib, patients inevitably develop secondary resistance to this treatment, which poses a significant challenge due to the paucity of post-osimertinib pharmacological options available to date. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of resistance mechanisms to osimertinib and to take advantage of the available knowledge to build future strategies and gain insights to overcome resistance to this agent.

### Heart Failure associated with the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor osimertinib [^113tSuHD]. JACC: CardioOncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

As demonstrated by this case, we currently lack diagnostic findings specific for osimertinib-associated cardiotoxicity, which remains a diagnosis of exclusion. The Food and Drug Administration label for osimertinib suggests obtaining baseline and on-treatment LVEF assessment only in patients with known cardiac risk factors. The label also recommends initiating a cardiac evaluation in patients on osimertinib who present with new symptoms potentially attributable to heart failure. Further investigation is needed to understand the risk factors for and mechanism by which osimertinib induces cardiomyopathy in a small number of patients. Until then, clinicians must be aware of the potentially serious but uncommon risk of cardiotoxicity from an otherwise well-tolerated and highly effective therapy.

### Osimertinib in patients with treatment-naive EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer: overall survival, post-progression management and budget impact analysis in real-world [^112SaHFc]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Budget Impact and Cost-Effectiveness Analyses

The monthly expense estimation per patients for each drug was calculated by multiplying the 28-days cost/patient by the number of 28-days cycles based on mTTD values and expressed as cost/TTD. Total cost of each drug was the estimated amount of money for the treatment of each patient. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated as the ratio between difference in costs and effectiveness between osimertinib and first-generation EGFR-TKIs comparators (erlotinib and gefitinib) as follows:

The prices are taken from "Gazzetta Ufficiale della Repubblica Italiana (Italian, traslation Official Gazette of the Italian Republic)", theof record of the(updated, 14 December 2022). For Osimertinib, we considered cost of Tagrisso; for erlotinob and gefitinib, we considered the costs of less expensive generic drugs. Difference in costs derives from the cost per month of treatment multiplied for median treatment duration for each drug considered, in terms of mTTD (total cost); difference in effectiveness from the benefit achieved by each drug, in terms of mOS.

As comparators' we considered effectiveness data on erlotinib and gefitinib, by a RW similar population before front-line osimertinib approval. Data were extracted from the electronic case report form (eCRF) used for 2 prospective observational study of our group on first-generation TKIs in RW setting. Details about the populations considered have been in part previously reported in the aforementioned studies and detailed in Supplementary Table S1 and Fig. S1.

The BI analysis compares forecast costs (theoretical BI) based on data from pivotal trials with respect to the real impact on regional health expenditure (real BI). The difference (BI-gap) between real-BI calculated on the mTTD in the present study and theoretical-BI calculated on median progression-free survival (mPFS) and mTTD from the pivotal FLAURA trial, was investigated.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis was performed through Sigma-Plot (Systat Software, San Jose, CA) software. The chi-square, Mann-Whitney, and Fisher's exact test were used for correlation analysis. The Kaplan-Meier method was applied to estimate median survivals. The log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard model for univariate and multivariate analysis were applied to identify correlation between clinical-pathological features and survivals.

### Assessment of effectiveness and safety of osimertinib for patients with intracranial metastatic disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113ZE7Vu]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Search and Selection Criteria

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, a literature search was conducted on September 20, 2019, using the following search query in MEDLINE and Embase databases: (osimertinib OR mereletinib OR tagrisso OR tamarix OR azd9291) AND (brain metastases OR intracranial metastatic disease OR cns). Only articles and abstracts published in English were considered, and all years from database inception to the search date were included. Study authors were not contacted. Retrieved records were screened by abstract for reference to osimertinib as treatment for IMD. Case reports, case series, and review articles were excluded. Records reporting intracranial outcomes were included in the analysis. This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses reporting guideline.

Data Extraction

Data for each outcome were directly extracted according to the study authors' outcome definitions and were not modified after extraction. A full list of extracted outcomes and trial characteristics is available in the eMethods in the Supplement. A list of the included studies is available in the eAppendix in the Supplement.

Statistical Analysis

Meta-analyses of proportions were conducted to pool estimates for CNS objective response rate (ORR) and CNS disease control rate (DCR) reported by more than 5 studies. The random-effects model was used and estimated with the restricted maximum likelihood method. Statistical tests included the Q statistic, τ 2, and I 2. The full statistical analysis is available in the eMethods in the Supplement. In addition, a comparative meta-analysis was conducted to calculate risk ratios for CNS ORR and CNS DCR by aggregating results from the 2 RCTs. All statistical analyses were conducted using the R programming language (R Foundation). The threshold for statistical significance was α = .05. All tests were 2 sided.

Assessment of Study Quality

Phase 3 trials were assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Phase 2 and retrospective trials were assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies.

### Assessment of effectiveness and safety of osimertinib for patients with intracranial metastatic disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114wNkkP]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Brain metastases, or intracranial metastatic disease (IMD), are a serious and common complication of cancer, occurring in 20% of patients with primary disease. Patients with IMD have a 2-year survival rate of 8.1% and are likely to experience decreases in quality of life from neurologic symptoms associated with their disease or treatment. Interest exists in new therapeutic modalities for patients with IMD because of the limitations of available options, such as surgical resection and stereotactic radiosurgery, which are often reserved for patients with good performance status and low tumor burden, or whole-brain radiotherapy, which is associated with neurocognitive decline. Targeted therapies have been proposed to fill this gap, despite historical concerns that the benefit of systemic therapies as treatments for IMD has been limited by their inability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The National Comprehensive Cancer Networkincludes 2 targeted therapies in their most recent IMD treatment guidelines, but the Congress of Neurological Surgeonscites insufficient evidence to recommend the use of targeted therapies in IMD.

Osimertinib mesylate was recently approved in North America as a first-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy for treatment of patients with metastatic non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the largest contributor to IMD, whose tumors have an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletion, exon 21 L858R substitution, or exon 20 T790M resistance substitution. Cancer cells with EGFR alterations have constitutive activity at that receptor, inducing cell survival and proliferation; EGFR-TKIs like osimertinib competitively inhibit an intracellular adenosine triphosphate–binding domain to prevent downstream signaling. Patients with NSCLC are recommended for genotype testing of their primary or secondary tumors to assess for the presence of EGFR alterations to evaluate their tumor sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs. However, 41% to 62% of NSCLC tumors with EGFR alterations develop T790M substitutions, conferring resistance to first-generation and second-generation EGFR-TKIs. Osimertinib is a third-generation EGFR-TKI that overcomes T790M alteration and is among several targeted therapies that have been considered for use in the prevention and management of IMD because of its ability to penetrate the BBB.

### Osimertinib-induced cardiotoxicity: a retrospective review of the FDA adverse events reporting system (FAERS) [^115D2goQ]. JACC: CardioOncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Study limitations

This analysis was a retrospective study of reported events in FAERS, and as such, baseline cardiac characteristics of patients taking TKIs are not known. The time to event for all cases with AEs was not available, nor was the grade of toxicity. Moreover, the actual incidence of cardiotoxicity with osimertinib cannot be determined because it is possible that not all events are reported within FAERS. As such, there are similar limitations in the ROR estimate. AE reporting for a drug may be influenced by extent of use, publicity, and bias. Although the use of disproportionality analysis through pharmacovigilance databases to determine the increased risk of AEs secondary to a particular drug has been shown in various settings, it is critical that any hypotheses generated by using pharmacovigilance databases are validated through prospective studies.

The significance of the present study is that it informs the potential increased risk of cardiotoxicity with osimertinib, which is now frontline treatment for EGFR-mutated NSCLC. In pivotal studies, the increased risk of cardiac failure and QT prolongation has been reported; analysis of FAERS corroborates this finding and also indicates that osimertinib is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation. NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations accounts for 10% of U.S. patients and 35% in Asia. As EGFR inhibitors continue to improve survival in NCSLC, there remains a need to monitor patients for signs and symptoms of treatment-related toxicity, particularly cardiotoxicity. We recommend that clinicians consider an electrocardiography (ECG) at baseline when initiating osimertinib and at periodic intervals to monitor for QT prolongation. Concomitant drugs that can increase QT prolongation should be avoided while taking osimertinib. As per the osimertinib package insert, if the QT interval is > 500 ms the osimertinib should be withheld until the QT interval is < 480 ms or recovers to baseline. If the baseline QT is > 480 ms, then osimertinib should be resumed at one-half the dose. Patients should also be monitored for signs and symptoms of cardiac failure while taking osimertinib, but it is likely that more evidence is needed before recommending standardized echocardiogram monitoring for every patient.

Our study raises many questions that require additional studies; for example, what is the mechanism of osimertinib-induced cardiotoxicity? Is there a patient population that is at increased risk of cardiotoxicity compared with others? Is the cardiotoxicity caused by osimertinib reversible or irreversible?

### Osimertinib + savolitinib to overcome acquired MET-Mediated resistance in epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated, MET-Amplified non-small cell lung cancer: TATTON [^113KFALb]. Cancer Discovery (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Osimertinib is a third-generation, irreversible, oral EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) that potently and selectively inhibits both EGFR-TKI–sensitizing and EGFR T790M resistance mutations and has demonstrated efficacy in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), including central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Osimertinib is considered the preferred first-line option for patients with metastatic NSCLC with EGFR-sensitizing mutations and has recently been approved as an adjuvant treatment in patients with resectable EGFR mutation–positive (EGFRm) NSCLC (Tagrisso US PI, and; ref.). Despite osimertinib's proven efficacy in the first-line metastatic setting, many patients with EGFRm NSCLC develop disease progression on osimertinib, with current data suggesting that approximately 25% of these patients develop MET amplification or other MET-based acquired resistance mechanisms, as previously reported based on genetic testing.

Combination therapy comprising a MET inhibitor and an EGFR-TKI is a potential treatment strategy that could overcome acquired MET-mediated resistance to EGFR-TKIs including osimertinib. Savolitinib, an oral, potent, and highly selective MET-TKI, has demonstrated preliminary clinical activity in advanced solid tumors. Preliminary investigation of the combination was studied in Part A of this study: TATTON (NCT02143466; ref.).

TATTON was a four-part study (Parts A–D). In the sections of TATTON described here (Parts B and D), patients with EGFRm advanced NSCLC with MET amplification/overexpression following disease progression on a prior EGFR-TKI received savolitinib plus osimertinib. Part B was split into three cohorts by prior therapy and T790M status. Part D patients had not received prior third-generation EGFR-TKI and were T790M-negative. Preliminary data from TATTON Parts B and D suggested that savolitinib plus osimertinib may overcome MET-based resistance to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC.

### Osimertinib for pretreated EGFR thr790Met-positive advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (AURA2): a multicentre, open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study [^117L3DyU]. The Lancet: Oncology (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Osimertinib (AZD9291) is an oral, potent, irreversible EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor selective for EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor sensitising mutations, and the EGFR Thr790Met resistance mutation. We assessed the efficacy and safety of osimertinib in patients with EGFR Thr790Met-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who had progressed after previous therapy with an approved EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor.

Methods

In this phase 2, open-label, single-arm study (AURA2), patients aged at least 18 years with centrally confirmed EGFR Thr790Met-positive mutations, locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC who progressed on previous EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor therapy received osimertinib 80 mg orally once daily; treatment could continue beyond progression if the investigator observed a clinical benefit. Patients with asymptomatic, stable CNS metastases not requiring steroids were allowed to enrol. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving an objective response by blinded independent central review using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1. Response endpoints were assessed in the evaluable for response analysis set (ie, all patients who received at least one dose of osimertinib and had measurable disease at baseline according to blinded independent central review). Other endpoints and safety were assessed in all patients receiving at least one osimertinib dose (full analysis set). The study is ongoing and patients are still receiving treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02094261.

Findings

Between May 20, 2014, and Sept 12, 2014, 472 patients were screened, of whom 210 started osimertinib treatment between June 13, 2014, and Oct 27, 2014; 11 patients were excluded from the evaluable for response analysis set (n = 199) due to absence of measurable disease at baseline by blinded independent central review. At data cutoff (Nov 1, 2015), 122 (58%) patients remained on treatment. The median duration of follow-up was 13.0 months (IQR 7.6–14.2). 140 (70%; 95% CI 64–77) of 199 patients achieved an objective response by blinded independent central review: confirmed complete responses were achieved in six (3%) patients and partial responses were achieved in 134 (67%) patients. The most common all-causality grade 3 and 4 adverse events were pulmonary embolism (seven [3%]), prolonged electrocardiogram QT (five [2%]), decreased neutrophil count (four [2%]), anaemia, dyspnoea, hyponatraemia, increased alanine aminotransferase, and thrombocytopenia (three [1%] each). Serious adverse events were reported in 52 (25%) patients, of which 11 (5%) were investigator assessed as possibly treatment-related to osimertinib. Seven deaths were due to adverse events; these were pneumonia (n = 2), pneumonia aspiration (n = 1), rectal haemorrhage (n = 1), dyspnoea (n = 1), failure to thrive (n = 1), and interstitial lung disease (n = 1). The only fatal event assessed as possibly treatment-related by the investigator was due to interstitial lung disease.

Interpretation

Osimertinib showed clinical activity with manageable side-effects in patients with EGFR Thr790Met-positive NSCLC. Therefore, osimertinib could be a suitable treatment for patients with EGFR Thr790Met-positive disease who have progressed on an EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor.

	Serious Febrile Reactions

Serious febrile reactions and fever of any severity accompanied by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration, or renal failure, can occur when MEKINIST is administered with dabrafenib.

MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Adult): In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], fever occurred in 58% of patients. Serious febrile reactions and fever of any severity complicated by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration or renal failure occurred in 5% of patients. Fever was complicated by hypotension in 4%, dehydration in 3%, syncope in 2%, renal failure in 1%, and severe chills/rigors in < 1% of patients.

MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Pediatric): In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], pyrexia occurred in 66% of patients.

Withhold MEKINIST when used as monotherapy, and both MEKINIST and dabrafenib when used in combination, if the patient's temperature is ≥ 100.4°F. In case of recurrence, therapy can also be interrupted at the first symptom of pyrexia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Fever may be complicated by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration, or renal failure. Evaluate for signs and symptoms of infection and monitor serum creatinine and other evidence of renal function during and following severe pyrexia. If appropriate, MEKINIST, or both MEKINIST and dabrafenib when used in combination, may be restarted if the patient has recovered from the febrile reaction for at least 24 hours, either at same or lower dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Administer antipyretics as secondary prophylaxis when resuming MEKINIST if patient had a prior episode of severe febrile reaction or fever associated with complications. Administer corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone 10 mg daily) for at least 5 days for second or subsequent pyrexia if temperature does not return to baseline within 3 days of onset of pyrexia, or for pyrexia associated with complications, such as dehydration, hypotension, renal failure, or severe chills/rigors, and there is no evidence of active infection.

### Severe immune-related adverse events are common with sequential PD-(L) 1 blockade and osimertinib [^115Vh8k8]. Annals of Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We found that the sequential use of PD-(L)1 blockade and osimertinib is associated with severe irAEs (pneumonitis and colitis). Importantly, this appears to be a drug-specific, rather than class-specific, interaction between osimertinib and PD-1 blockade that is responsible for the severe irAEs seen. The toxicity appears temporally associated with last dose of PD-(L)1 blockade and generally appears within weeks of starting osimertinib. Awareness of this potential interaction is needed to minimize inadvertent toxicity and to determine strategies to optimally select and sequence available therapies for patients with advanced lung cancers.

With the increasing breadth of treatment options for patients with newly diagnosed NSCLC, the optimal approach for the front-line therapy and how to integrate routine molecular testing requires thoughtful consideration. In cases where molecular results are not immediately available at initial visit with an oncologist, it may be tempting to begin PD-(L)1 blockade with or without chemotherapy while awaiting results, with the plan to switch to osimertinib if an EGFR mutation is found for patients with metastatic disease. In locally advanced, unresectable stage III disease, all patients with NSCLC may receive durvalumab as standard practice, irrespective of EGFR status. These approaches may have important consequences on the safety of future use of osimertinib in patients with EGFR -mutant NSCLC. If osimertinib is subsequently prescribed, patients should be monitored closely for irAEs, especially if there has been < 3-month interval since last PD-L1 blockade.

### Cardiac events and survival in patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer treated with osimertinib [^112qj8gm]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Although it has been reported that osimertinib mesylate provides better survival benefits compared with first- or second-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKIs), it remains unclear whether osimertinib is associated with more cancer therapy-related cardiac events (CTRCEs) compared with other EGFR TKIs, as does the extent of the association these adverse effects may have with overall survival. This issue is particularly critical due to the high prevalence of EGFR variants within Asian populations, including that of Taiwan.

Objective

To compare CTRCEs and their association with survival in patients treated with osimertinib vs other EGFR TKIs.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study was conducted at the National Cheng Kung University Hospital, a college hospital and tertiary academic referral center in Taiwan. The median follow-up duration was 23.2 (IQR, 15.2–31.5) months. A total of 401 patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) beginning treatment with EGFR TKIs from September 1, 2019, to July 31, 2022, were retrospectively analyzed. CTRCEs included newly emerging arrhythmias, valvular heart diseases (moderate and more), myocardial infarction, and heart failure and were analyzed after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index, cardiovascular comorbidities, thoracic radiotherapy, and cardiovascular medications. Follow-up was completed January 31, 2024.

Exposure

Osimertinib.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate CTRCEs in patients treated with osimertinib or other EGFR TKIs. Considering that death can lower the incidence of CTRCEs, the competing risk method was used to calculate CTRCEs after adjusting for potential confounders. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis for overall survival was used to explore whether CTRCEs were independently associated with overall survival.

Results

Among the 401 patients (253 [63.1%] female; mean [SD] age, 69.2 [11.3] years), 195 (48.6%) treated with osimertinib were matched with 206 (51.4%) treated with other EGFR TKIs. Occurrence of CTRCEs in patients receiving osimertinib was significantly higher compared with patients treated with other EGFR TKIs (29 [14.9%] vs 9 [4.4%]; hazard ratio [HR], 3.37; 95% CI, 1.56–7.26; P = 0.002). After adjustment for relevant cardiovascular risk factors, the HR of CTRCEs was significantly higher in the group treated with osimertinib (adjusted subdistribution HR, 4.00; 95% CI, 1.81–8.85; P < .001). In addition, CTRCEs were independently associated with overall survival (HR, 4.02; 95% CI, 2.44–6.63; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study of patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC, osimertinib was associated with a higher incidence of CTRCEs compared with other EGFR TKIs; CTRCEs were independently associated with overall survival. These findings highlight the need for ongoing cardiac monitoring in these patients, regardless of preexisting cardiac risk factors.

### Dacomitinib approved, but might not Be used [^116ob3ou]. Cancer Discovery (2018). Low credibility.

The FDA approved the EGFR inhibitor dacomitinib as a first-line therapy for patients with metastatic, EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer. However, the drug is unlikely to be used in clinical practice because four other EGFR inhibitors, including standard-of-care osimertinib, have already been approved.

### Osimertinib-induced cardiotoxicity: a retrospective review of the FDA adverse events reporting system (FAERS) [^11192A6x]. JACC: CardioOncology (2019). Medium credibility.

In the comparison of osimertinib versus other EGFR-TKIs for risk of cardiotoxicity, there was an increased risk of cardiac failure, atrial fibrillation, and QT prolongation. Again, the ROR for QT prolongation versus other EGFR-TKIs was highest at 6.6. The RORs for myocardial infarction and pericardial effusion were not significantly increased.

Cardiovascular AEs are a well-known toxicity of TKIs used in chronic myeloid leukemia, such as with imatinib (first-generation BCR-ABL1 TKI), dasatinib (second-generation BCR-ABL1 TKI), and ponatinib (third-generation BCR-ABL1 TKI). However, this has not been reported in clinical trials with first-generation anti–EGFR-TKIs (erlotinib or gefitinib) or second-generation anti–EGFR-TKIs (afatinib). The AURA3 trial (Randomized Phase III Study of Osimertinib vs Platinum-Pemetrexed for EGFR T790M-Positive Advanced NSCLC) compared osimertinib versus chemotherapy and determined that cardiotoxicity (defined by a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] ≥ 10% and to an LVEF < 50%) occurred in 5% of the osimertinib arm, with a median time of 5.5 months to onset of LVEF decline. The rate of QT prolongation was also high in the osimertinib arm in the AURA3 trial (3% vs. 0%). Similarly, in the FLAURA trial (Osimertinib in Untreated EGFR-Mutated Advanced Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer), which compared osimertinib versus a first-generation EGFR-TKI (gefitinib or erlotinib) in the frontline setting, there was a higher rate of QT prolongation (10% vs. 4%) and LVEF decrease ≥ 10% to < 50% with osimertinib (3% vs. 1%). Osimertinib has also been reported to lead to severe cardiac dysfunction such as myocarditis. Oyakawa et al. described a case of osimertinib-induced myocarditis in which even after 12 weeks of discontinuation of osimertinib, there was no improvement in LVEF.

### FDA benefit-risk assessment of osimertinib for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer harboring epidermal growth factor receptor T790M mutation [^116A2HVE]. The Oncologist (2018). Low credibility.

On March 30, 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved osimertinib for the treatment of patients with metastatic, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M mutation-positive, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as detected by an FDA-approved test, whose disease has progressed following EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. Approval was based on demonstration of a statistically significant difference in the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) when comparing osimertinib with chemotherapy in an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial (AURA3). In this confirmatory trial, which enrolled 419 patients, the PFS hazard ratio for osimertinib compared with chemotherapy per investigator assessment was 0.30 (95% confidence interval 0.23–0.41), p < .001, with median PFS of 10.1 months in the osimertinib arm and 4.4 months in the chemotherapy arm. Supportive efficacy data included PFS per blinded independent review committee demonstrating similar PFS results and an improved confirmed objective response rate per investigator assessment of 65% and 29%, with estimated median durations of response of 11.0 months and 4.2 months, in the osimertinib and chemotherapy arms, respectively. Patients received osimertinib 80 mg once daily and had a median duration of exposure of 8 months. The toxicity profile of osimertinib compared favorably with the profile of other approved EGFR TKIs and chemotherapy. The most common adverse drug reactions (> 20%) in patients treated with osimertinib were diarrhea, rash, dry skin, nail toxicity, and fatigue. Herein, we review the benefit-risk assessment of osimertinib that led to regular approval, for patients with metastatic NSCLC harboring EGFR TKI whose disease has progressed on or after EGFR TKI therapy.

Implications For Practice

Osimertinib administered to metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring an EGFR T790M mutation, who have progressed on or following EGFR TKI therapy, demonstrated a substantial improvement over platinum-based doublet chemotherapy as well as durable intracranial responses. The ability to test for the T790M mutation in plasma using the FDA-approved cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2 (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) identifies patients with NSCLC tumors not amenable to biopsy. Since a 40% false-negative rate has been observed with the circulating tumor DNA test, re-evaluation of the feasibility of tissue biopsy is recommended to identify patients with a false-negative plasma test result who may benefit from osimertinib.

### Osimertinib versus afatinib in patients with T790M-positive, non-small-cell lung cancer and multiple central nervous system metastases after failure of initial EGFR-TKI treatment [^113vHstF]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Osimertinib (OSI; TAGRISSO, AstraZeneca), an oral, 3rd-generation, irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) that selectively inhibits both EGFR-TKI-sensitizing and EGFR T790M resistance mutations, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on November 13, 2015 to treat patients with acquired EGFR T790M resistance or progression on or after EGFR-TKI therapy, and it may resolve the impasse. In a phase I/II clinical trial (AURA Study Phase II Extension Component, NCT01802632) involving 198 evaluable patients with EGFR-TKI–pretreated EGFR- and T790M-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), showed that OSI leads to a promising median progression-free survival (PFS)(12.3 months, 95% confidence interval [CI] 9.5 to 13.8), and median durable response (15.2 months, 95% CI, 11.3 to not calculable). These findings were verified by a Phase II study involving OSI (80 mg/d) in 411 individuals with T790M-positive NSCLC, in which the median PFS was 11.0 months. Nevertheless, whether OSI has superior survival benefits and higher activity against T790M-positive NSCLC and multiple central nervous system (CNS) metastases after failure of initial EGFR-TKI treatment compared with afatinib (AFA) remains unknown.

We therefore conducted a retrospective review of patients with T790M-positive NSCLC and multiple CNS metastases after failure of initial EGFR-TKI treatment to compare the efficacy of OSI versus AFA therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis that retrospectively compared OSI against AFA for the management for T790M-positive NSCLC and multiple CNS metastases after failure of initial EGFR-TKI treatment in an Asian population.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^111hcnaC]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Infusion-related reactions (systemic toxicities) — characterization and management: Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) are characterized by adverse reactions to the infusion of pharmacologic or biologic substances, with presenting symptoms typically including low-grade fever, chills, headache, or nausea, while high-grade reactions can include tachycardia, blood pressure lability, hypoxemia, chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, flushing, sweating, urticaria or pruritis, angioedema, and presyncope or syncope. Infusion reactions associated with ICPIs are uncommon, and mild IRRs require no intervention as symptoms are typically transient; for moderate IRRs, interruption of the infusion and slowing of the rate of infusion upon rechallenge can be effective, and supportive therapies may be required such as IV fluids, diphenhydramine, acetaminophen, and NSAIDs.

### Osimertinib-induced cardiotoxicity: a retrospective review of the FDA adverse events reporting system (FAERS) [^116ezUbB]. JACC: CardioOncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

This study is a retrospective analysis that used data queries from the FAERS pharmacovigilance monitoring database. FAERS is a public database that contains nearly 17 million AE reports, medication error reports, and product quality complaints reported by health care professionals, manufacturers, and consumers from around the world since 1968. These reports are managed by the FDA and evaluated by clinical reviewers in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. Data in each event report, where applicable, include individual case identification numbers for reference, the suspected pharmaceutical, reason for use, adverse reactions, nature of the event (i.e. serious), outcomes (e.g. hospitalized, death, other outcomes), sex (male, female, or unknown), age, weight, event date, initial FDA receipt date, latest FDA receipt date, pharmaceutical company, reporter (e.g. health care professional, consumer, pharmaceutical company, unknown), concomitant medications, latest manufacturer received date, country where the event occurred, and manufacturer control number. Individual names and date of birth are excluded from these lists.

The present study involved data queries of the FAERS database between January 1, 2016, and September 30, 2018, for AEs secondary to EGFR-TKIs, namely "Osimertinib", "Erlotinib", "Afatinib", and "Gefitinib". Only EGFR-TKIs with > 100 AEs in the database were chosen for analysis (dacomitinib was excluded). We chose January 1, 2016, as the start date for all TKIs to decrease bias, given that it represents a time period post–osimertinib FDA approval. Of note, other TKIs were FDA-approved before osimertinib. We queried for AEs classified by group queries according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities that had ≥ 30 events. There were 6 cardiac-related AEs due to TKIs that met that criteria, namely: "Cardiac failure", "Atrial Fibrillation", "Electrocardiogram QT prolonged", "Myocardial infarction", "Pericardial Effusion", and "Cardiac failure congestive" (Supplemental Table 1). Cardiac failure congestive and cardiac failure AEs were grouped together for analysis. FAERS was accessed on January 28, 2019.

### Osimertinib with or without chemotherapy in-mutated advanced NSCLC [^112oNeYU]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Osimertinib is a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) that is selective for EGFR-TKI-sensitizing and EGFR T790M resistance mutations. Evidence suggests that the addition of chemotherapy may extend the benefits of EGFR-TKI therapy.

Methods

In this phase 3, international, open-label trial, we randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio patients with EGFR -mutated (exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation) advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who had not previously received treatment for advanced disease to receive osimertinib (80 mg once daily) with chemotherapy (pemetrexed [500 mg per square meter of body-surface area] plus either cisplatin [75 mg per square meter] or carboplatin [pharmacologically guided dose]) or to receive osimertinib monotherapy (80 mg once daily). The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. Response and safety were also assessed.

Results

A total of 557 patients underwent randomization. Investigator-assessed progression-free survival was significantly longer in the osimertinib-chemotherapy group than in the osimertinib group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49 to 0.79; P < 0.001). At 24 months, 57% (95% CI, 50 to 63) of the patients in the osimertinib-chemotherapy group and 41% (95% CI, 35 to 47) of those in the osimertinib group were alive and progression-free. Progression-free survival as assessed according to blinded independent central review was consistent with the primary analysis (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.80). An objective (complete or partial) response was observed in 83% of the patients in the osimertinib-chemotherapy group and in 76% of those in the osimertinib group; the median response duration was 24.0 months (95% CI, 20.9 to 27.8) and 15.3 months (95% CI, 12.7 to 19.4), respectively. The incidence of grade 3 or higher adverse events from any cause was higher with the combination than with monotherapy - a finding driven by known chemotherapy-related adverse events. The safety profile of osimertinib plus pemetrexed and a platinum-based agent was consistent with the established profiles of the individual agents.

Conclusions

First-line treatment with osimertinib-chemotherapy led to significantly longer progression-free survival than osimertinib monotherapy among patients with EGFR -mutated advanced NSCLC. (Funded by AstraZeneca; FLAURA2 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04035486.).

### Cardiac risk-informed treatment of EGFR-mutant lung cancer with Osimertinib [^117H25Bt]. JACC: CardioOncology (2019). Medium credibility.

With this background, the analysis of the FDA Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS) undertaken by Anand et al. is timely and helpful. In this database, the total number of patients treated with each drug overall (denominator) is unknown, with emphasis instead on the number of reports of significant adverse events. The major downside of this database is that reporting is voluntary and likely does not encompass all events, introducing multiple forms of bias. In addition, the medical histories and circumstances of the toxicities are unknown. Nevertheless, the authors included data from FAERS encompassing 8,440 adverse events attributed to treatment with an EGFR TKI since January of 2016 and observed an overall low incidence of cardiac adverse events related to EGFR TKIs (n = 315). Still, among these, osimertinib was the culprit drug in approximately one-half of the cases (n = 158), whereas the 3 other EGFR TKIs queried (gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib) together shared responsibility for the other one-half of cardiac events (n = 157). In addition, the authors calculated a reporting odds ratio by comparing rates of each adverse event associated with osimertinib to all other drugs in FAERS as well as to the 3 other EGFR TKIs, and found that the reporting odds ratio for osimertinib compared with all other drugs was 5.4 for cardiac failure and 11.2 for QTc prolongation, and compared with the 3 other EGFR TKIs was 2.2 for cardiac failure and 6.6 for QTc prolongation. In summary, this analysis confirms that as the number of patients treated with osimertinib is now likely in the tens or hundreds of thousands, a signal for rare and potentially serious cardiac events remains evident.

Although we agree with Anand et al. that the risk of osimertinib cardiac toxicity should inform baseline testing and monitoring, the observed risks are not sufficient to warrant changes in prescribing of osimertinib. What remains most critical in our opinion is determining the best approach for baseline testing and on-treatment monitoring to allow identification of potentially serious toxicities early enough to intervene. For patients found to have an asymptomatic decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction, the appropriate frequency of monitoring and efficacy of dose-reduction remains unknown, while holding osimertinib can have dramatic negative consequences. For now, providers should be aware of osimertinib-induced cardiotoxicity and consider it in the differential for patients on this medication who are having shortness of breath, volume overload, palpitations, or other potentially relevant cardiovascular symptoms.

EGFR-associated amivantamab AEs

On-target versus Off-target effects

Targeted cancer treatments are associated with on-target and off-target AEs. On-target AEs with amivantamab include skin and gastrointestinal reactions associated with EGFR inhibition and peripheral edema, hypoalbuminemia, and transaminase elevation associated with MET inhibition (Figure 1). Additionally, IV amivantamab, as with other infused therapies, can be associated with infusion-related reactions (IRRs), with symptoms including chills, nausea, shortness of breath, hypotension, and rash.

Figure 1.
Molecular pathways targeted by amivantamab with associated adverse effect profile. ADCC, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity; AE, adverse event; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; IRR, infusion-related reaction; MET, mesenchymal epithelial transition.

Common AEs

Many amivantamab-associated AEs are also shared with other EGFR-targeting therapies, as wild-type EGFR is widely distributed in the skin; thus, dermatologic toxicities are the most common AEs associated with EGFR-targeting monoclonal antibodies and TKIs.

How Was the AURA3 Study Conducted. AURA3 is a Phase III, open label, randomized study comparing TAGRISSO. TM with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. To be included in AURA3, patients had an abnormal epidermal growth factor receptor lung cancer that had spread to other parts of the lungs or body and had previously been treated with an approved EGFR-TKI medicine that had stopped working or did not work. Patients were allocated by a ratio of 2: 1 Tagrisso: chemotherapy. For more information on how this study was conducted, refer to the product label. Which Questionnaire Was Used to Collect Patient-Reported Symptoms. Patients reported their symptom experiences via the Patient Reported Outcomes – Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events questionnaire.

PRO-CTCAE was developed by the National Cancer Institute to evaluate symptomatic toxicity in patients in oncology clinical trials. The PRO-CTCAE questionnaire was designed to provide additional information that is complementary to existing safety and tolerability assessments reported by clinicians. How Were Patient-Reported Symptoms in the AURA3 Study Collected. Patients reported their symptom experiences just before treatment and each week during treatment, using the PRO-CTCAE questionnaire. PRO-CTCAE data was collected from 102 patients randomized to Tagrisso and 59 patients randomized to chemotherapy for whom PRO-CTCAE was available in their language. The majority of PRO-CTCAE participants were female in both arms. The median age was 66. 5 years in the Tagrisso arm vs. 66 years in the Chemo arm. About half of the participants were Asian in both arms.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: melanoma: cutaneous, version 2.2024 [^113Lj4wH]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Melanoma: Cutaneous — BRAF and MEK inhibitor safety — In phase III trials, the risk of toxicity (all grade, grade 3–5) was similar for BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination therapy compared with single-agent BRAF inhibitor therapy, and both regimens were associated with high rates of flu-like symptoms including pyrexia and chills, fatigue/asthenia, headache, musculoskeletal aches/pains, and gastrointestinal upset. BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination therapy was associated with higher risk of pyrexia and diarrhea, whereas BRAF inhibitor monotherapy was associated with higher risk of musculoskeletal complaints. Hyperproliferative skin toxicities had notably higher prevalence with BRAF inhibitor monotherapies than with BRAF/MEK combinations, including hyperkeratosis, palmoplantar disorders, keratoacanthoma, and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Due to better efficacy and a different toxicity profile, BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination therapy is generally preferred over BRAF inhibitor monotherapy. Rare patients on combination therapy may experience toxicities thought to be attributable to MEK inhibitors (eg, deep venous thrombosis, retinal problems, concerns about immunosuppression), and discontinuation of the MEK inhibitor may be helpful. There are few data to inform selection among the combination options (dabrafenib/trametinib, vemurafenib/cobimetinib, encorafenib/binimetinib), as none have been directly compared. Grade 5 toxicities were rare (≤ 2% in phase III trials) in trials testing BRAF inhibitor monotherapy or BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination therapies; reported grade 5 adverse events (AEs) included cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events, infection-related events, and multi-organ failure, and it is not clear which were treatment related. Additional rare high-grade AEs of special interest include ocular AEs, QT prolongation, decreased ejection fraction, thrombotic events, and development of new primary malignancies. Across prospective trials, most AEs manifest within the first few months of therapy, although AEs continue to develop throughout treatment at a lower rate.

- Mutations in the EGFR gene are observed in about 15% of NSCLC adenocarcinomas in the United States and are not associated with smoking. There are numerous EGFR mutations, with the most common being exon 19 deletions and the point mutation L858R in exon 21.•Osimertinib, an oral TKI, is used as the initial therapy for metastatic NSCLC harboring exon 19 deletion and exon 21 L858R mutation. Common side effects include acneiform rash, diarrhea, and paronychia. Osimertinib has also been associated with cardiomyopathy (∼1.4%-2.4%) and prolongation of the QT interval (2.7%).•In our experience, osimertinib-induced cardiomyopathy can be managed with the cessation of osimertinib and the initiation of guideline-directed therapy. Given that osimertinib is often the best available therapy, rechallenging with osimertinib often favors benefit over risk. Safe rechallenge with osimertinib is demonstrated in this case.

Results

The total number of AEs in FAERS from all drugs was 5,138,230. Of those, 8,450 AEs were due to osimertinib, erlotinib, afatinib, or gefitinib. Of 8,450 AEs, 2,454 were secondary to osimertinib; 5,836 were due to other EGFR-TKIs (erlotinib, afatinib, or gefitinib); and 160 were due to the combination, in which osimertinib and any of the 3 other EGFR-TKIs were listed as a possible cause. A total of 315 cardiac AEs were noted, 150 (6.1%) due to osimertinib, 8 (5%) due to osimertinib combined with other TKIs, and 157 (2.7%) due to other TKIs (Table 1).

Table 1
Adverse Events Due to EGFR-TKIs in FAERS From 2016 to 2018

As detailed in Table 2, cardiac failure was the most common AE caused by osimertinib, followed by QT prolongation. More than 90% of the reactions due to cardiac failure and QT prolongation were serious. In 19.3% of the cardiac failure cases, osimertinib and at least 1 other non-TKI drug were considered as leading to the AE. Similarly, in the case of QT prolongation, 33% of the cases had osimertinib and at least 1 other non-TKI drug was considered as leading to the AE. For the subset of patients for whom event timing was available, the median time to event was 29 days for cardiac failure and 23 days for QT prolongation.

### Osimertinib in pretreated T790M-positive advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: AURA study phase II extension component [^116rzFvm]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Osimertinib is an irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) selective for both EGFR-TKI sensitizing (EGFRm) and T790M resistance mutations. AURA (NCT01802632) is a phase I/II clinical trial to determine the dose, safety, and efficacy of osimertinib. This article reports the results from the phase II extension component. Patients and Methods Patients with EGFR-TKI-pretreated EGFRm- and T790M-positive advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) received once-daily osimertinib 80 mg. T790M status was confirmed by central testing from a tumor sample taken after the most recent disease progression. Patients with asymptomatic, stable CNS metastases that did not require corticosteroids were allowed to enroll. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) by independent radiology assessment. Secondary end points were disease control rate, duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS), and safety. Patient-reported outcomes comprised an exploratory objective. Results In total, 201 patients received treatment, with a median treatment duration of 13.2 months at the time of data cutoff (November 1, 2015). In evaluable patients (n = 198), ORR was 62% (95% CI, 54% to 68%), and the disease control rate was 90% (95% CI, 85 to 94). Median duration of response in 122 responding patients was 15.2 months (95% CI, 11.3 to not calculable). Median PFS was 12.3 months (95% CI, 9.5 to 13.8). The most common possibly causally related adverse events (investigator assessed) were diarrhea (43%; grade ≥ 3, < 1%) and rash (grouped terms; 40%; grade ≥ 3, < 1%). Interstitial lung disease (grouped terms) was reported in eight patients (4%; grade 1, n = 2; grade 3, n = 3; grade 5, n = 3). Conclusion In patients with EGFRm T790M advanced NSCLC who progress after EGFR-TKI treatment, osimertinib provides a high ORR, encouraging PFS, and durable response.

### Osimertinib in resected-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer [^112mT9RR]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Osimertinib is standard-of-care therapy for previously untreated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The efficacy and safety of osimertinib as adjuvant therapy are unknown.

Methods

In this double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients with completely resected EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC in a 1:1 ratio to receive either osimertinib (80 mg once daily) or placebo for 3 years. The primary end point was disease-free survival among patients with stage II to IIIA disease (according to investigator assessment). The secondary end points included disease-free survival in the overall population of patients with stage IB to IIIA disease, overall survival, and safety.

Results

A total of 682 patients underwent randomization (339 to the osimertinib group and 343 to the placebo group). At 24 months, 90% of the patients with stage II to IIIA disease in the osimertinib group (95% confidence interval [CI] 84 to 93) and 44% of those in the placebo group (95% CI, 37 to 51) were alive and disease-free (overall hazard ratio for disease recurrence or death, 0.17; 99.06% CI, 0.11 to 0.26; P < 0.001). In the overall population, 89% of the patients in the osimertinib group (95% CI, 85 to 92) and 52% of those in the placebo group (95% CI, 46 to 58) were alive and disease-free at 24 months (overall hazard ratio for disease recurrence or death, 0.20; 99.12% CI, 0.14 to 0.30; P < 0.001). At 24 months, 98% of the patients in the osimertinib group (95% CI, 95 to 99) and 85% of those in the placebo group (95% CI, 80 to 89) were alive and did not have central nervous system disease (overall hazard ratio for disease recurrence or death, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.33). Overall survival data were immature; 29 patients died (9 in the osimertinib group and 20 in the placebo group). No new safety concerns were noted.

Conclusions

In patients with stage IB to IIIA EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC, disease-free survival was significantly longer among those who received osimertinib than among those who received placebo. (Funded by AstraZeneca; ADAURA ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02511106.).

### Cardiac risk-informed treatment of EGFR-mutant lung cancer with Osimertinib [^116JUY9L]. JACC: CardioOncology (2019). Medium credibility.

The oral epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor osimertinib first received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in November 2015 and has been widely prescribed by medical oncologists since that time, initially as a salvage therapy and over the past 18 months, as first-line treatment for patients with advanced EGFR-mutant non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Osimertinib, like other EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), takes advantage of the unique cellular biology of a subset of NSCLCs. Defined by somatic mutations in the EGFR gene, this subset has an intracellular signaling network that is particularly dependent on the EGF receptor such that inhibition of EGFR leads to arrested cell growth and apoptosis producing profound and durable responses to EGFR TKI therapy, in contrast to the more modest responses that standard chemotherapies elicit.

Due to several potential advantages, osimertinib has become the preferred first-line therapy for EGFR -mutant cancers. A recent phase III randomized trial demonstrated improved duration of treatment efficacy (median length 19 months) and survival with osimertinib compared with older TKIs geftinib or erlotinib. Osimertinib also has a decreased incidence of common EGFR family side effects like rash and diarrhea, and better penetration into the brain. Yet, as treatment with osimertinib becomes more common, concerns have been raised regarding rare but potentially serious cardiac toxicities, which historically have not been reported with other EGFR TKIs. The study presented in this issue of JACC: CardioOncology by Anand et al. represents the first large, systematic effort to quantify the risk of cardiac toxicities such as QTc prolongation and cardiac failure with osimertinib compared with other EGFR inhibitors.

When considering cardiac toxicities of a treatment used in patients with lung cancer, the baseline risk of cardiac events must be taken into consideration. EGFR -mutant NSCLC is not associated with smoking; hence, most patients are remote or never smokers with low expected risk of cardiac events. In that setting, rare cardiotoxicities (heart failure and asymptomatic QTc prolongation) were noted even in the earliest phase 1 safety trial of osimertinib. Combined analysis of the first 2 randomized trials using osimertinib found an increased estimated pooled risk ratio of heart failure and QTc prolongation of 2.7 (p = 0.03) and 2.6 (p = 0.003), respectively, for osimertinib versus the comparator arms. Still, heart failure was rare, occurring in 21 (3.8%) of 558 patients treated with osimertinib in these 2 trials.

### Targeting C-myc to overcome acquired resistance of EGFR mutant NSCLC cells to the third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, osimertinib [^114NVMF8]. Cancer Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Osimertinib (AZD9291 or TAGRISSO) is a promising and approved third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for treating patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR-activating mutations or the resistant T790M mutation. However, the inevitable emergence of acquired resistance limits its long-term efficacy. A fuller understanding of the mechanism of action of osimertinib and its linkage to acquired resistance will enable the development of more efficacious therapeutic strategies. Consequently, we have identified a novel connection between osimertinib or other EGFR-TKIs and c-Myc. Osimertinib rapidly and sustainably decreased c-Myc levels primarily via enhancing protein degradation in EGFR-mutant (EGFRm) NSCLC cell lines and xenograft tumors. c-Myc levels were substantially elevated in different EGFRm NSCLC cell lines with acquired resistance to osimertinib in comparison with their corresponding parental cell lines and could not be reduced any further by osimertinib. Consistently, c-Myc levels were elevated in the majority of EGFRm NSCLC tissues relapsed from EGFR-TKI treatment compared with their corresponding untreated baseline c-Myc levels. Suppression of c-Myc through knockdown or pharmacologic targeting with BET inhibitors restored the response of resistant cell lines to osimertinib. These findings indicate that c-Myc modulation mediates the therapeutic efficacy of osimertinib and the development of osimertinib acquired resistance. Furthermore, they establish c-Myc as a potential therapeutic target and warrant clinical testing of BET inhibition as a potential strategy to overcome acquired resistance to osimertinib or other EGFR inhibitors. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates a critical role of c-Myc modulation in mediating therapeutic efficacy of osimertinib including osimertinib acquired resistance and suggests targeting c-Myc as a potential strategy to overcome osimertinib acquired resistance.

### Cardiac adverse events in-mutated non-small cell lung cancer treated with Osimertinib [^112C7hnb]. JACC: CardioOncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In this retrospective cohort study, the incidence of cardiac AEs in patients treated with osimertinib was similar to that observed in the clinical trials but unexpectedly higher than that observed in the post-marketing surveillance in Japan. Additional prospective data collection of advanced NSCLC patients treated with osimertinib will be important in understanding the incidence, pathophysiology, and management of cardiac AEs with osimertinib.

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: QTc prolongation is well described with osimertinib. However, the incidence of other cardiac AEs is less well described. Among 123 NSCLC patients treated with osimertinib, cardiac AEs occurred in 4.9%. These included acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and valvular diseases. These AEs may occur more commonly in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease or risk factors.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Further studies should focus on elucidating the mechanisms underlying cardiac AEs associated with osimertinib. Moreover, prospective studies with standardized data collection are needed to define the epidemiology of osimertinib associated cardiac disease, and clinical studies are needed to understand strategies to prevent and treat cardiac AEs.

To our knowledge, the LAURA trial is the first randomized trial to identify a PFS benefit with consolidation EGFR‑targeted therapy after chemoradiation in unresectable, locally advanced EGFR‑mutated NSCLC. Although OS data are not yet mature, the hazard ratio for PFS of 0.16 favoring osimertinib over placebo indicates considerable clinical benefit, and the majority of patients in the placebo arm received osimertinib at progression. While OS data are awaited, the noted PFS benefit indicates that osimertinib after chemoradiation for locally advanced NSCLC may be considered a new standard of care for patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R mutation; the associated increase in adverse events with osimertinib consolidation and the absence of a finite duration for proposed consolidation therapy need to be carefully discussed with eligible patients before initiation of therapy.
