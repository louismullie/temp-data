## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about laboratory testing for diarrhea, preserving the stepwise thinking and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying diarrhea by duration and severity to anchor pretest probability. Then, I should verify which acute scenarios warrant stool testing versus when supportive care suffices. Next, I will review the optimal stool specimen type and testing modalities, including culture-independent panels and targeted assays. After that, I need to check the chronic diarrhea pathway, including inflammatory markers, celiac disease, Giardia, bile acid diarrhea, and when to escalate to endoscopy. Finally, I should confirm special populations, public health and outbreak considerations, and a practical algorithm that integrates cost and yield, while double-checking areas where guidelines conflict or where I might have overgeneralized earlier statements.

> Let me first confirm the classification framework because everything downstream depends on it. Acute diarrhea is typically less than 14 days, persistent is 14 to 30 days, and chronic is beyond 4 weeks; severity is often gauged by frequency, volume, dehydration, fever, and blood, and these categories guide the breadth of testing and urgency of evaluation [^117UB8rU] [^113TiG83] [^112uKQ3J].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions for acute diarrhea; I should verify when testing changes management. For mild, nonbloody, afebrile illness in immunocompetent hosts, supportive care is usually sufficient and routine stool testing is low yield; however, I should test when there is dysentery, moderate to severe disease, fever, systemic toxicity, immunocompromise, recent antibiotics or healthcare exposure, outbreak risk, or symptoms persisting beyond about a week, as these features increase the likelihood of a treatable pathogen and justify targeted diagnostics [^114cLVtN] [^112taLBZ] [^1119FQgy].

> Wait, let me verify the specimen quality point because it materially affects sensitivity. The optimal specimen is a diarrheal stool sample that takes the shape of the container; if stool is not available, a rectal swab with visible feces is acceptable, but stool yields substantially higher detection rates than rectal swabs for bacterial and viral pathogens, sometimes by several fold, so I should prioritize collecting actual stool whenever feasible [^116GmvSi] [^112zjLxi].

> I need to check which pathogens to target in acute presentations. For bloody diarrhea, I should test for Shiga toxin–producing E. coli and culture for O157:H7, and I should also consider Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and Yersinia when fever, mucus, or severe cramping are present; for healthcare-associated or post-antibiotic diarrhea, I should test for C. difficile; for large-volume rice-water stools or relevant exposures, I should test for Vibrio; and for persistent abdominal pain, especially right lower quadrant in children, I should consider Yersinia given its appendicitis-like mimicry [^1159NYzk] [^1147dqkc] [^111FMCQ1] [^117SFMqP] [^115JBgXJ].

> Let me consider testing modalities carefully. Culture-independent multiplex gastrointestinal panels increase sensitivity and turnaround compared with culture, but I should confirm positives with culture when isolate submission is required for public health or when susceptibility testing would alter management; for C. difficile, a two-step algorithm with a highly sensitive screening test followed by a toxin assay improves specificity, and I should avoid testing formed stools or asymptomatic patients to reduce false positives [^112taLBZ] [^111U73AS] [^113Ra2qe] [^1119FQgy].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "always culture any CIDT-positive bacterial hit", but I should correct that nuance. Culture confirmation is specifically recommended when public health reporting requires isolates or when antimicrobial susceptibility would change therapy or outbreak response; otherwise, routine culture of every CIDT-positive result is not universally mandated for individual patient care, so I need to align with local public health rules and the clinical scenario [^111U73AS] [^114ysXiZ] [^111wMcXV].

> Next, I should review the chronic diarrhea pathway, starting with noninvasive screening. I need to ensure I do not over-order inflammatory blood tests; the AGA recommends fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin to screen for IBD and advises against ESR or CRP for this purpose, with a calprotectin threshold around 50 μg/g optimizing sensitivity and lactoferrin thresholds in the 4–7.25 μg/g range performing similarly, albeit with lower-quality evidence for lactoferrin [^112uKQ3J] [^111pbEFB] [^114Zj6M4].

> I should double-check celiac disease testing because it is frequently overlooked. The AGA recommends IgA tissue transglutaminase as first-line, with a second test if IgA deficiency is suspected; positive serology should be confirmed with duodenal biopsies before committing to a lifelong gluten-free diet, and I should remember that chronic diarrhea with weight loss or steatorrhea is a classic indication to test [^113t3v7i] [^113y34Dt] [^1113botT].

> Let me verify Giardia testing because it is a common and treatable cause of chronic watery diarrhea. The AGA recommends testing for Giardia with antigen or PCR, which have high sensitivity and specificity; if suspicion remains high and the first test is negative, a second specimen can be considered given intermittent shedding, but routine broad O&P testing without epidemiologic risk is discouraged in low-risk hosts [^111BcB9D] [^116QZx9f].

> I will now examine bile acid diarrhea, since it is underrecognized. The AGA suggests considering BAD testing or an empiric trial of bile acid binders when chronic watery diarrhea persists; in North America, options include a 48-hour stool bile acid collection or serum FGF19, though commercial assays are limited and an empiric cholestyramine trial is reasonable when testing is unavailable, with the caveat that symptom response supports the diagnosis rather than proving it [^116FVDh2] [^117CfYLn] [^111gcr5D].

> But wait, what if the patient has alarm features or the diagnosis remains unclear after initial noninvasive testing. I should confirm that colonoscopy with random biopsies is appropriate to exclude microscopic colitis, IBD, and neoplasia, and upper endoscopy with duodenal biopsies is indicated when celiac disease is suspected or malabsorption remains unexplained; in patients under 45 with diarrhea, some guidelines also support fecal calprotectin to stratify the need for urgent endoscopy, though local pathways vary [^112gFkx1] [^116pvouh] [^114oH5gi].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. In people with HIV, I should have a lower threshold for stool testing, consider multiplex panels, and obtain susceptibility testing if a pathogen is identified due to resistance concerns; in older adults or the immunocompromised, I should broaden testing for infections and malabsorption; in pregnancy, I should avoid radiologic imaging when possible and prioritize noninvasive stool testing; and in children, I should tailor testing to severity and exposures, recognizing that norovirus is common and that routine O&P is not indicated for short-duration community-acquired diarrhea without risk factors [^115KgSk7] [^116UUwad] [^112iFnqa].

> Hold on, I should verify public health and outbreak considerations because they change the testing scope. During suspected outbreaks, I should coordinate with health departments and test a broader set of agents regardless of individual severity features; CIDT-positive results that are reportable should be cultured to obtain isolates for typing and susceptibility, and norovirus outbreaks should be linked via CaliciNet when possible to support epidemiologic investigations [^113KxSyB] [^115T7tHT] [^111U73AS] [^115aqS4v].

> Let me reconsider the practical algorithm to avoid overtesting. For acute diarrhea, start with clinical assessment and hydration; test selectively based on severity, duration, dysentery, immunocompromise, healthcare association, or outbreak risk; prefer stool over rectal swabs; and use CIDTs when available, confirming with culture when required or when susceptibility matters. For chronic diarrhea, start with fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin, celiac serology with total IgA, and Giardia testing; consider BAD testing or an empiric binder trial; and escalate to colonoscopy and upper endoscopy with biopsies if alarms are present or the etiology remains obscure, aligning with guideline-based thresholds and local resources [^114cLVtN] [^112taLBZ] [^112uKQ3J] [^1119FQgy].

> Finally, I should double-check a few pitfalls. Do not use fecal leukocytes or lactoferrin to determine the cause of acute infectious diarrhea, avoid routine O&P in low-risk acute cases, do not test formed stools for C. difficile, and remember that most acute diarrheas are self-limited; persistent symptoms beyond 14 days warrant reevaluation for noninfectious causes and a reassessment of fluids, nutrition, and any prior antimicrobial therapy [^113y3Eyo] [^112iFnqa] [^113Ra2qe] [^111pT2PA].

For diarrhea, order **CBC, electrolytes, renal function, and glucose** to assess dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and systemic effects [^113Y3eya]. Add **stool studies** (culture, C. difficile toxin, Giardia antigen, ova and parasites) for persistent (> 7 days), severe, or bloody diarrhea, or immunocompromised patients [^114cLVtN] [^112taLBZ] [^112iFnqa]. Use **fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin** to screen for IBD in chronic diarrhea [^112uKQ3J] [^111pbEFB], and test for celiac disease with tTG-IgA plus IgA levels [^113t3v7i]. Reserve **C. difficile testing** for antibiotic-associated or healthcare-associated diarrhea [^111FMCQ1], and consider bile acid diarrhea testing or empiric trial in chronic watery diarrhea [^116FVDh2] [^117CfYLn]. Routine serology or endocrine tests are not indicated without specific clinical suspicion [^1139WpoV].

---

Laboratory evaluation of diarrhea should be **guided by duration, severity, and clinical context**. Start with basic tests (CBC, electrolytes, renal function, glucose), add stool studies for persistent or severe cases, and use targeted tests (fecal calprotectin, celiac serology, bile acid diarrhea) for chronic diarrhea. Avoid routine serology or endocrine tests unless clinically indicated [^113Y3eya].

Follow-up evaluations after laboratory-confirmed pathogen-specific diarrhea — Follow-up testing is not recommended in most people for case management following resolution of diarrhea (strong, moderate), although serial stool specimens using culture-dependent methods for Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Paratyphi, STEC, Shigella, nontyphoidal Salmonella, and other bacterial pathogens are recommended in certain situations by local health authorities following cessation of diarrhea to enable return to child care, employment, or group social activities (strong, moderate), and practitioners should collaborate with local public health authorities to adhere to return policies (strong, high). A clinical and laboratory reevaluation may be indicated in people who do not respond to an initial course of therapy and should include consideration of noninfectious conditions including lactose intolerance (weak, low). Noninfectious conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), should be considered in people with symptoms lasting 14 or more days and unidentified sources (strong, moderate). Reassessment of fluid and electrolyte balance, nutritional status, and optimal dose and duration of antimicrobial therapy is recommended in people with persistent symptoms (strong, high).

### Pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of chronic watery diarrhea [^1174bXkA]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic watery diarrhea poses a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge and is often a disabling condition for patients. Although acute diarrhea is likely to be caused by infection, the causes of chronic diarrhea (> 4 weeks in duration) are more elusive. We review the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of chronic diarrhea. Drawing on recent insights into the molecular mechanisms of intestinal epithelial transport and barrier function, we discuss how diarrhea can result from a decrease in luminal solute absorption, an increase in secretion, or both, as well as derangements in barrier properties. We also describe the various extraepithelial factors that activate diarrheal mechanisms. Finally, clinical evaluation and tests used in the assessment of patients presenting with chronic diarrhea are reviewed, and an algorithm guiding therapeutic decisions and pharmacotherapy is presented.

### Laboratory diagnostic challenges in case / control studies of diarrhea in developing countries [^116x3ziV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Case/control studies of acute infectious diarrhea require accurate and dependable laboratory tests to detect pathogens in samples from both symptomatic patients and healthy control subjects. The methods used to detect these pathogens have usually been evaluated on patient samples only, and their performance on samples from control subjects is mostly unknown. Because many pathogens occur at a high overall frequency in developing countries and thus may be present in a notable proportion of control subjects as well as patients, the relative ability of a diagnostic test to detect these pathogens in diarrheic and normal stools can have a profound effect on the interpretation of case/control data.

ACG Clinical Guideline — epidemiology/public health and diagnosis: Diagnostic evaluation using stool culture and culture-independent methods if available should be used in situations where the individual patient is at high risk of spreading disease to others, and during known or suspected outbreaks. Stool diagnostic studies may be of value in cases of dysentery, moderate-to-severe disease, and symptoms lasting > 7 days to clarify the etiology of the patient's illness and enable specific directed therapy. Traditional methods of diagnosis fail to reveal the etiology of the majority of cases of acute diarrheal infection; if available, the use of FDA-approved culture-independent methods of diagnosis can be recommended at least as an adjunct to traditional methods. Antibiotic sensitivity testing for management of the individual with acute diarrheal infection is currently not recommended.

### Acute bloody diarrhea: a medical emergency for patients of all ages [^115MSYwf]. Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Acute bloody diarrhea should be considered a medical emergency. Its causes are frequently serious or actionable or both and are usually identified. However, acute bloody diarrhea as a stand-alone clinical presentation has received little scholarly attention in the past several decades. Although the range of possible causes of acute bloody diarrhea is broad, infectious considerations are paramount and should always be prioritized in the evaluation of such patients. History, examination, and laboratory testing should be focused on minimizing time to diagnosis (and, by extension, to implementing appropriate therapy). Strategically chosen tests and imaging, avoidance of extraneous diagnostic pursuits, and provision of supportive care while awaiting diagnostic clarity are central to the adroit management of patients with acute bloody diarrhea. Diagnostic considerations differ somewhat between adults and children but have many elements in common, including the need for vigilance in detecting Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection. In this review, we discuss diagnostic approaches (emphasizing the importance of rapid, accurate, and thorough microbiologic investigation) and measures that can be taken to support patients while awaiting information that determines the cause of their disease. These topics are discussed in the context of the medical care that is available to children and adults with bloody diarrhea in most institutions in developed nations.

### Laboratory diagnostic challenges in case / control studies of diarrhea in developing countries [^116QSzJU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Two key factors that govern the usefulness and reliability of a laboratory test are its sensitivity and specificity. For almost all tests, these parameters are first determined by using "spiked" samples and then evaluated under field conditions, often in comparison with other tests. A test that is highly sensitive and specific will reliably detect a pathogen in cases with few false-negative or false-positive results. However, diagnostic tests are seldom evaluated in control subjects (ie, individuals without symptoms). In industrialized countries this is seldom an issue because the prevalence of most pathogens in healthy subjects is low. In developing countries, however, where sanitation is poor and exposure to contaminated food and water is virtually a daily norm, intestinal pathogens circulate at high frequency and children are liable to become repeatedly infected with them. Accordingly, endemic pathogens will be present at a far higher frequency overall than in industrialized countries. The ability to detect these pathogens in control subjects will differ according to the sensitivity of the diagnostic procedures that are used.

Most comprehensive case/control studies of diarrhea include culture for bacterial pathogens, such as Salmonella species, Shigella species, and Escherichia coli. Culture of fecal samples has an intrinsically low sensitivity to detect pathogens, especially in individuals without diarrhea, because the complex microbiota of healthy individuals makes it difficult to detect a pathogen among the high background "noise". The fact that culture of feces is a useful diagnostic procedure despite its low sensitivity can be explained partly by the fact that in patients with diarrhea, the pathogen is generally excreted in far higher numbers and makes up a much greater proportion of the cultivable microbiota than in healthy subjects who are asymptomatic carriers of the same pathogen. The odds of finding a pathogen in both cases and controls can be considerably improved by using selective media with or without prior enrichment. The use of such media has revolutionized our understanding of the epidemiology of bacterial enteropathogens such as Campylobacter jejuni in developing and industrialized countries.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the laboratory evaluation of functional diarrhea and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome in adults (IBS-D) [^112uKQ3J]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Guidelines — evaluation of chronic diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D): Current evidence supports the use of fecal calprotectin or fecal lactoferrin and stool testing for Giardia in patients presenting with chronic diarrhea. The panel suggests against the use of blood tests ESR or CRP to screen for IBD. Our evidence profiles also strongly recommend testing for celiac disease with IgA-tTG and a second test to detect celiac disease in the setting of IgA deficiency. In addition, testing for bile acid diarrhea is suggested. The AGA makes no recommendation for the use of currently available serologic tests for the diagnosis of IBS. A clinical decision support tool is included to guide the evaluation of patients with chronic watery diarrhea (> 4 weeks).

### Chronic diarrhea: diagnosis and management [^113uFvCT]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic diarrhea is a common problem affecting up to 5% of the population at a given time. Patients vary in their definition of diarrhea, citing loose stool consistency, increased frequency, urgency of bowel movements, or incontinence as key symptoms. Physicians have used increased frequency of defecation or increased stool weight as major criteria and distinguish acute diarrhea, often due to self-limited, acute infections, from chronic diarrhea, which has a broader differential diagnosis, by duration of symptoms; 4 weeks is a frequently used cutoff. Symptom clusters and settings can be used to assess the likelihood of particular causes of diarrhea. Irritable bowel syndrome can be distinguished from some other causes of chronic diarrhea by the presence of pain that peaks before defecation, is relieved by defecation, and is associated with changes in stool form or frequency (Rome criteria). Patients with chronic diarrhea usually need some evaluation, but history and physical examination may be sufficient to direct therapy in some. For example, diet, medications, and surgery or radiation therapy can be important causes of chronic diarrhea that can be suspected on the basis of history alone. Testing is indicated when alarm features are present, when there is no obvious cause evident, or the differential diagnosis needs further delineation. Testing of blood and stool, endoscopy, imaging studies, histology, and physiological testing all have roles to play but are not all needed in every patient. Categorizing patients after limited testing may allow more directed testing and more rapid diagnosis. Empiric antidiarrheal therapy can be used to mitigate symptoms in most patients for whom a specific treatment is not available.

### Laboratory diagnostic challenges in case / control studies of diarrhea in developing countries [^114aurEj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The laboratory procedures used to detect etiologic agents in patients with acute infectious diarrhea are constantly evolving. Nevertheless, the principles underlying the performance and interpretation of these procedures are well established. As with clinical diagnostic microbiology in general, the choice of the tests used to detect a possible etiologic agent is determined by clinical relevance, practicability, and cost. For the most part, this approach is satisfactory, although in some cases no etiologic agent is identified. This may be because the diarrhea is not infectious in origin, or because a particular agent is not identified either because it was not sought or because the procedures used to detect it were not sufficiently sensitive and gave a false-negative result. On the other hand, when a single pathogen is found, interpretation of the results is straightforward, insofar as the pathogen is usually assumed to be responsible for the patient's symptoms.

In case/control studies, in addition to investigating diarrheic samples for pathogens, we undertake the far less familiar task of investigating feces or rectal swabs from subjects without diarrhea. The detection of a pathogen in these individuals indicates asymptomatic carriage, the possible reasons for which are discussed in the accompanying article by Levine and Robins-Browne in this supplement.

Analysis of the outcome of a case/control study involves comparing the frequencies of the detection of pathogens in cases and control subjects, which are used to determine an odds ratio (OR). As the OR indicates the strength of the association between a pathogen and the occurrence of diarrhea, it is used as a measure of the relative pathogenicity of different pathogens. The OR is also one factor in the equation utilized to calculate attributable fraction, which provides an estimate of the relative contribution of the pathogen(s) of interest to the diarrheal disease burden (see the article by Blackwelder et al in this supplement). Because the frequency of detection of pathogens in control subjects can have a profound effect on the interpretation of case/control data, it is essential to understand the performance of laboratory tests in samples from subjects without diarrhea, as well as those from patients.

Introduction

To review stool diagnostic tests in acute and chronic diarrhea.

Methods

Narrative review of published literature.

Results

In acute diarrhea, stool tests are indicated when there is strong pretest probability of infectious etiology or Clostridioides difficile infection suggested by > 3 unformed bowel movements per 24 hours, symptoms lasting > 7 days, and circumstances that are suggestive of infection. Several commercially available rapid tests for bacterial, viral, or protozoal infections may be offered in addition to traditional methods (e.g. culture, microscopy) and provide a result within 6 hours. For C. difficile infections, a highly sensitive test such as glutamate dehydrogenase test is required; however, this does not distinguish infection from carrier state. That differentiation requires specialized nucleic acid amplification test (for toxin B) or enzyme immunoassays for toxin A or B, which are unfortunately not generally offered by microbiology laboratories. Chronic diarrhea may result from inflammatory, fatty, osmotic, or secretory causes; the commonest cause is diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome/functional diarrhea. Current recommendations in societal guidelines or clinical practice updates regarding stool tests in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome/functional diarrhea in the absence of alarm symptoms include testing for Giardia, calprotectin, fecal immunochemical test, and bile acid diarrhea. Comprehensive stool biochemical analyses (osmolality, pH, electrolytes) differentiate osmotic from secretory diarrhea and identify laxative abuse. Specific stool diagnostic tests for bile acid diarrhea and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency can lead to specific diagnosis and treatments. Surrogate markers associated with high fecal output and rapid transit in chronic diarrhea are stool form and colonic transit.

Discussion

Fecal testing is still very relevant in the practice of gastroenterology and deserves introduction of advanced microbiological and biochemical tests.

Diarrhea generates a wide range of diagnostic considerations and has profound individual and public health significance. The setting and circumstances under which a patient presents with diarrhea drastically influences the concern brought to the encounter. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are often provisionally labeled "gastroenteritis" with appropriate expectant management. In resource-poor countries, the significance of diarrhea is even greater. This review focuses on diarrhea and its initial evaluation and management in the emergency department.

Infectious diarrhea — workup when no pathogen is identified or symptoms worsen: If no pathogen has been identified, it may be reasonable to reevaluate stool and/or blood if there is evidence of systemic symptoms to evaluate for an undetected pathogen; if symptoms worsen after antibiotics, antibiotic-associated diarrhea (non–C. difficile) should be considered, and if hospitalized or with healthcare exposure, C. difficile becomes an additional consideration, particularly if there is fever or leukocytosis > 20000 cells/µL, and stool should be assessed for C. difficile toxin or a toxigenic C. difficile strain (eg, NAAT); stool also should be submitted for culture and susceptibility, and if a bacterial etiology is confirmed and antibiotics are indicated or have been used, susceptibility testing may reveal antimicrobial resistance.

Celiac disease testing for chronic diarrhea (American Gastroenterological Association [AGA]) — In patients presenting with chronic diarrhea, the AGA recommends testing for celiac disease with IgA tissue transglutaminase and a second test to detect celiac disease in the setting of IgA deficiency; Strong recommendation with moderate-quality evidence. Testing options for IgA-deficient subjects include IgG tissue transglutaminase and IgG or IgA deamidated gliadin peptides. The sensitivity of serum IgA-tTG using thresholds in the 7–15 AU/mL range is typically > 90% and the specificity is typically slightly higher, and a positive test would warrant confirmation by duodenal biopsy. In adults, small bowel biopsy should be used to confirm a serologic diagnosis of celiac disease before committing a patient to a strict gluten-free diet.

### Laboratory approaches to infectious diarrhea [^113dw9dc]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Future applications of advanced molecular diagnostics in clinical laboratories will enhance significantly capabilities to diagnose bacterial, parasitic, and viral agents in the early course of disease through enhanced assay sensitivities and specificities and improved turnaround times, theoretically leading to more timely and directed therapeutic intervention. Until such time, clinicians must continue to rely on clinical judgment and the diverse battery of traditional culture techniques, direct examination (including light microscopy and electron microscopy), and immunoassays that are available. Cost considerations and the ever-increasing array of infectious agents responsible for infectious gastroenteritis will continue to drive the development of practice guidelines to assist practitioners with reasoned and reasonable approaches to management of diarrheal illnesses.

### A Bayesian approach to acute infectious diarrhea in adults [^115wAEaf]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Acute infectious diarrhea is a yearly occurrence for most Americans, and is associated with 1 million hospitalizations and about 6000 deaths in the United States annually. Up to 80% of acute infectious diarrhea is caused by noroviruses, which produce a clinically mild illness with a predictable short course and good outcome that make laboratory testing and antimicrobial treatment unnecessary. Most diarrhea-causing bacteria and protozoa can cause a clinical illness "like norovirus"; when they do so in healthy adults neither specialized testing nor antimicrobials is required. The presence or absence of epidemiologic evidence (such as travel, hospitalization, antibiotic use, other exposures)and clinical evidence (such as diarrhea frequency and duration, severity of abdominal pain and fever, character of stool, presence of chronic illness or immune deficiency) can change the probability of "not norovirus" from as low as 8% to as high as 100%. Such probabilities guide the use of laboratory testing and antimicrobial therapy in patients who have acute infectious diarrhea.

Parasitic diarrhea diagnostics — during initial evaluation, including in immunocompetent children > 2 years old, bacterial and viral etiologies should be considered first if symptoms are less than 2 weeks, and in community-acquired diarrhea routine parasite testing is not indicated and usually should not be performed. When clinically indicated, ova and parasite (O&P) examination should be requested; historically 3 specimens collected over a 7–10 day period were recommended, but cost-effective options include obtaining a second specimen only if the first is negative and symptoms persist, with a third submitted only if the patient remains O&P negative and symptomatic. Targeted use of immunoassay testing or nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) can serve as a screen, immunoassays for Giardia may be sensitive enough that only a single specimen is needed with additional samples considered when suspicion remains, and no data define the number of specimens needed when NAAT is performed. Specimen preservatives depend on intended testing and manufacturer recommendations, and it is imperative to consult the laboratory to ensure proper transport conditions.

Gastroenteritis, infectious and toxin-induced diarrhea — testing indications and method selection are described as follows: For most patients with acute diarrhea, diagnostic testing is not indicated; however, fecal testing, using culture or culture independent methods, is indicated for patients with moderate to severe, bloody, febrile, dysenteric, nosocomial, or persistent diarrheal illnesses and for immunocompromised patients, and insurance coverage may be limited for highly multiplexed culture independent molecular assays (12 or more targets) when performed on outpatients not meeting these indications. C. difficile testing should be limited to patients with new onset diarrhea who are not taking laxatives with typical clinical presentation and risk factors, and although often included in multiplex molecular panels, singleplex testing is adequate. Stool culture has longer time to result and often fails to detect the causative agent, thus, when available, culture-independent methods are recommended for detection of bacterial pathogens.

Infections of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract — general approach to diagnosis — For many of these infections, particularly noninflammatory diarrhea and acute gastroenteritis of short duration, no laboratory testing is recommended. The specimen of choice to diagnose diarrheal illness is the diarrheal stool, not a formed stool or a swab, with a notable exception in pediatrics where a swab is acceptable when feces is noted on the swab. Fecal testing for causes of infectious gastroenteritis using culture or culture independent methods is indicated for patients with moderate to severe, bloody, febrile, dysenteric, nosocomial, or persistent diarrheal illnesses or immunocompromised patients, and routine testing for other than C. difficile is often restricted to patients who have been hospitalized more than 3 days. Culture independent multiplex molecular tests are reported to be more sensitive than culture, result in higher rates of detection, and often cost more than culture methods, and toxin or nucleic acid amplification testing for C. difficile should only be done on diarrheal stool.

### Reducing inappropriate testing for the evaluation of diarrhea among hospitalized patients [^111mz39R]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Diarrhea is one of the most common illnesses in the United States. Evaluation frequently does not follow established guidelines. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a computerized physician order entry-based test guidance algorithm with regard to the clinical, financial, and operational impacts.

Methods

Our population was patients with diarrheal illness at a tertiary academic medical center. The intervention was a computerized physician order entry-based test guidance algorithm that restricted the use of stool cultures and ova and parasites testing of diarrhea in the adult inpatient location vs nonintervention sites, which were the emergency department, pediatric inpatient and adult and pediatric outpatient locations. We measured stool culture, ova and parasites, and Clostridium difficile testing rates from July 1, 2012 to January 31, 2016. Additionally, we calculated advisor usage, consults generated, accuracy of information, and cost savings.

Results

There was a significant decrease in stool culture and ova and parasites testing rates at the adult inpatient (P = 0.001 for both), pediatric (P < .001 for both), and adult emergency department (P < .001; p = 0.009) locations. The decrease at the intervention site was immediate, whereas the other locations showed a delayed but sustained decrease that suggests a collateral impact. A significant increase in the rate of stool culture and ova and parasites testing was observed in the outpatient setting (P = 0.02 and P = 0.001). We estimate that $21,931 was saved annually.

Conclusions

A point-of-order test restriction algorithm for hospitalized adults with diarrhea reduced stool testing. Similar programs should be considered at other institutions and for the evaluation of other conditions.

### The practical value of comprehensive stool analysis in detecting the cause of idiopathic chronic diarrhea [^112zmTWP]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The practical diagnostic value of fecal analysis in the evaluation of patients with chronic nonbloody diarrhea is controversial. It is possible that variations in its value depend on how it is done and how the results are interpreted rather than on its intrinsic value. In the authors' city, stool analysis has been made easily accessible, with a commitment to quality assurance and interpretation. To evaluate its practical value, the results of stool analysis obtained on stool specimens submitted by gastroenterologists were retrospectively reviewed.

### Clinical and microbiological profile of patients with diarrhea evaluated using the gastrointestinal panel in a high-complexity center [^114iE5zj]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study confirms that GIP is a valuable diagnostic tool in the management of adult patients with diarrheal disease, particularly in immunocompromised patients. In our setting it is still a costly and difficult to access test, which makes it necessary to standardize the indications for its application. Future studies could evaluate its cost-effectiveness in our context.

### The role of endoscopy in the management of patients with diarrhea [^112gFkx1]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2010). Medium credibility.

Diarrhea endoscopy — recommendations (initial evaluation and small-bowel workup) state that stool and laboratory tests should be the initial step for the evaluation of clinical scenarios suggestive of infectious diarrhea. In patients with chronic unexplained diarrhea, we suggest colonoscopy with random biopsies of the right and left side of the colon, and sigmoidoscopy is an alternative option, although this may miss right-sided organic disease. We recommend intubation of the terminal ileum during colonoscopy for patients undergoing evaluation of chronic diarrhea, and there are insufficient data to determine whether biopsy of an endoscopically normal-appearing terminal ileum should be routinely performed, but the yield of this is likely low. We recommend esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with small-bowel biopsy in patients with chronic diarrhea or suspected malabsorption and inconclusive evaluation after colonoscopy with biopsy and in patients with positive celiac serology. We recommend obtaining a minimum of 4 duodenal biopsy specimens for evaluation of suspected celiac disease. Enteroscopy is not recommended for the routine evaluation of chronic diarrhea but may be useful for evaluation of small-bowel disease when other investigations are nondiagnostic.

### Measurement issues in trials of pediatric acute diarrheal diseases: a systematic review [^114iDmJd]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Worldwide, diarrheal diseases rank second among conditions that afflict children. Despite the disease burden, there is limited consensus on how to define and measure pediatric acute diarrhea in trials.

Objectives

In RCTs of children involving acute diarrhea as the primary outcome, we documented (1) how acute diarrhea and its resolution were defined, (2) all primary outcomes, (3) the psychometric properties of instruments used to measure acute diarrhea and (4) the methodologic quality of included trials, as reported.

Methods

We searched CENTRAL, Embase, Global Health, and Medline from inception to February 2009. English-language RCTs of children younger than 19 years that measured acute diarrhea as a primary outcome were chosen.

Results

We identified 138 RCTs reporting on 1 or more primary outcomes related to pediatric acute diarrhea/diseases. Included trials used 64 unique definitions of diarrhea, 69 unique definitions of diarrhea resolution, and 46 unique primary outcomes. The majority of included trials evaluated short-term clinical disease activity (incidence and duration of diarrhea), laboratory outcomes, or a composite of these end points. Thirty-two trials used instruments (eg, single and multidomain scoring systems) to support assessment of disease activity. Of these, 3 trials stated that their instrument was valid; however, none of the trials (or their citations) reported evidence of this validity. The overall methodologic quality of included trials was good.

Conclusions

Even in what would be considered methodologically sound clinical trials, definitions of diarrhea, primary outcomes, and instruments employed in RCTs of pediatric acute diarrhea are heterogeneous, lack evidence of validity, and focus on indices that may not be important to participants.

Fecal inflammatory markers — diagnostic thresholds and accuracy for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): Use of a higher fecal calprotectin threshold value "(100–164 μg/g) is associated with a markedly decreased sensitivity without a marked increase in specificity". For fecal lactoferrin, "using a threshold value from 7.25 μg/g, the pooled sensitivity for IBD was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.73–0.84) and the pooled specificity was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.63–0.99)". The evidence base for lactoferrin was judged low quality due to "risk of bias, significant heterogeneity, and statistical imprecision", and concerns are "compounded by the small likelihood that a positive test would initiate further confirmatory evaluation… compared to the 10% likelihood that persons without IBD might be needlessly exposed to further confirmatory testing".

### Chronic diarrhoea in adults: what not to miss [^1169dzYE]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic diarrhoea remains a diagnostic challenge, with numerous causes and few effective symptomatic treatments. This review focuses on new methods for diagnosis of common disorders and alerts readers to rarer causes through a systematic approach to the underlying mechanisms.

Recent Findings

New strategies are emerging to stratify the need for endoscopic investigation. Faecal immunochemical testing, combined with standard blood tests, shows promise in excluding colorectal cancers, adenoma and inflammatory bowel disease, challenging the current use of faecal calprotectin. Serum analysis for markers of bile acid synthesis has been refined, potentially streamlining diagnostic pathways of bile acid malabsorption for those who are unable to access nuclear medicine scans, but the positive predictive value of faecal elastase in low prevalence populations has been questioned. Novel markers such as volatile organic compounds and stool DNA analyses continue to develop.

Summary

A systematic approach to investigation of chronic diarrhoea will ensure all relevant causes are considered and minimize the chance of a missed diagnosis. Combination of clinical features with noninvasive testing supports a judicious approach to endoscopic investigations but further innovation will be needed to resolve the diagnostic challenge that diarrhoea poses.

### Clinical testing and diagnosis for crypto | Cryptosporidium… [^1139QV57]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- When a patient has diarrhea caused by Cryptosporidium, diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis can be made by testing stool specimens.
- Because detection of Cryptosporidiumcan be difficult, patients might be asked to submit stool specimens over three days. Stool specimen analysis Several germs, including the parasite Cryptosporidium, can cause diarrhea. To help determine which germ is causing diarrhea and how best to manage and treat the illness, healthcare providers can ask patients to give a stool specimen for lab testing. Historically, to help diagnose cryptosporidiosis, stool specimens have been examined microscopically using different techniques — such as acid-fast staining, direct fluorescent antibody, or enzyme immunoassay. Historically, tests for Cryptosporidium have not routinely been done in most laboratories; therefore, healthcare providers have needed to specifically request testing for this parasite.

DNA–based diagnostic test — such as polymerase chain reaction — are increasingly used in reference diagnostic labs. PCR panels, which at same time test fora variety of different germs that cause diarrhea including bacteria, virus, and parasites including Cryptosporidium. Infected people do not shed, or release. Cryptosporidium in their stool continually. To help detect Cryptosporidium in stool specimens, healthcare providers can tell patients to submit stool specimens over three days. Diagnostic lab tests cannot tell Cryptosporidium genotypes, species, and subtypes apart from each other. However, DNA fingerprinting–based techniques used by CryptoNet labs can do this technique.

### CaliciNet surveillance network… [^115aqS4v]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- CaliciNet is a national norovirus outbreak surveillance network of public health laboratories in the United States, coordinated by CDC.
- The database helps CDC better understand noroviruses and develop interventions to prevent them from spreading. About CaliciNet CaliciNet focuses on: CaliciNet is a national norovirus outbreak surveillance network of federal, state, and local public health laboratories in the United States. CDC launched CaliciNet in 2009 to collect information on norovirus strains associated with gastroenteritis outbreaks in the United States. About caliciviruses Noroviruses, together with sapoviruses, are part of the family Caliciviridae or caliciviruses that cause diarrheal disease. The name calicivirus is derived from the cup-shaped depressions seen on the virus particles when viewed using an electron microscope.

Public health impact Through CaliciNet, participating public health laboratories identify norovirus strains that cause gastroenteritis outbreaks. This is critical for linking outbreaks to a common source, such as:

- Contaminated food
- Monitoring circulating strains
- Identifying new emerging strains, such as GII. P16-GII. 4 Sydney The information collected through CaliciNet helps public health professionals better understand noroviruses and develop interventions to prevent them from spreading. CaliciNet data and reporting Participating public health laboratories use standardized laboratory protocols to examine the genetic makeup of norovirus strains. These laboratories electronically submit laboratory data to the CaliciNet database. Types of data collected The CaliciNet database includes: Genetic sequences of norovirus strainsassociated with gastroenteritis outbreaks in the United States.
