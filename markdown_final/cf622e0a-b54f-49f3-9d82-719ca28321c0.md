## Question

Is pioglitazone an appropriate treatment for acute hepatitis B?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether pioglitazone is an appropriate treatment for acute hepatitis B. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what pioglitazone is actually indicated for and whether there is any evidence for use in hepatitis B. Then, I should verify its hepatic safety profile and label warnings about abnormal liver tests. Next, I will examine any data in viral hepatitis and consider pathophysiologic plausibility in acute HBV. After that, I need to weigh risk versus benefit in the setting of marked transaminase elevations. Finally, I will synthesize a clear conclusion and note any caveats about terminology such as "contraindication" versus "do not use" in labeling language [^115MLYCS] [^112TJ3Xt].

> Let me first confirm the indication and scope of evidence. Pioglitazone is FDA‑approved for type 2 diabetes mellitus and not for hepatitis B or any viral hepatitis indication, and its off‑label liver-related use has been in metabolic liver disease such as NASH/MASH with multiple trials showing biochemical and histologic improvement, not in HBV infection [^115MLYCS] [^114T6MNm] [^111P6a58]. I should also check whether anyone tried it in viral hepatitis more broadly; a pilot in chronic hepatitis C added pioglitazone to pegylated interferon/ribavirin and failed to improve virologic response, which suggests no antiviral benefit in that context and, by extension, no clear rationale for HBV where mechanisms differ and no supportive data exist [^113wLcVs].

> Now, I need to check the hepatic safety language on the label because that is central here. Multiple FDA sources instruct "do not use" in patients with unexplained liver test abnormalities, and pioglitazone trials systematically excluded patients with ALT greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal, which is a critical threshold in considering acute hepatitis scenarios where enzymes are typically far higher [^112TJ3Xt] [^115S9Hhb] [^111EGnjM]. Hold on, I should verify postmarketing safety signals; there are documented postmarketing reports of fatal and non‑fatal hepatic failure associated with pioglitazone-containing products, even though causality cannot always be established, reinforcing caution in active liver injury states [^113yDCEw] [^1133AYDn] [^1144vjgh].

> I will now examine whether there are mechanistic or case-level signals of hepatotoxicity. A published case report described a mixed hepatocellular–cholestatic injury that resolved after stopping pioglitazone, which, while uncommon, underscores a potential idiosyncratic hepatotoxic risk in susceptible settings; uncommon elevations in liver enzymes are also acknowledged in labeling [^117P7FU3] [^112dr4pS]. Wait, let me verify consistency; although a large 3‑year trial did not find Hy's law cases and showed lower ALT > 3×ULN incidence with pioglitazone than glyburide, those trials excluded patients with significant baseline LFT abnormalities, limiting generalizability to acute hepatitis B where baseline injury is severe [^111EGnjM].

> Next, I should review the clinical context of acute HBV and link it to what the label advises. In acute viral hepatitis, aminotransferases commonly surge well above the exclusion thresholds used in pioglitazone trials; I need to be careful not to overstate precise enzyme ranges since I don't have a provided HBV-specific citation here, but the key point is that these are "unexplained" or active LFT abnormalities at presentation, a situation in which FDA labeling directs clinicians not to initiate pioglitazone and to use caution in any liver disease setting [^112TJ3Xt] [^1143HuVF]. Hold on, I should also verify pharmacokinetic considerations in hepatic impairment; while mean AUC may be similar and Cmax reduced in moderate–severe impairment, labels still advise caution and highlight postmarketing liver failure signals, which argues against adding potential hepatic stress during acute injury [^112EAidb] [^116kW5X6].

> Now, let me weigh risk versus benefit in this specific scenario. Benefits for acute HBV are essentially absent, as pioglitazone has no demonstrated antiviral or anti‑HBV activity and failed to enhance virologic response in HCV when added to interferon‑based therapy, whereas proven HBV management relies on supportive care and virus‑directed therapy when indicated, neither of which is addressed by an insulin sensitizer [^113wLcVs]. Risks include introducing a drug with postmarketing hepatic failure reports into a liver already under acute inflammatory stress, in a setting where the label instructs not to use with abnormal LFTs and where clinical trials excluded similar patients, shifting the balance firmly against use [^113yDCEw] [^112TJ3Xt] [^111EGnjM].

> Synthesis and clarification before concluding. The initial impulse might be to label this a strict contraindication; wait, I should double‑check the exact regulatory wording. The FDA language says "do not use" in patients with unexplained LFT abnormalities and "use with caution" in liver disease, rather than listing acute hepatitis B as a formal contraindication, but functionally in the acute HBV setting with marked enzyme elevations, this operates as a de facto no‑use scenario given the absence of benefit and presence of risk [^112TJ3Xt] [^115S9Hhb] [^113yDCEw].

> Final position. Pioglitazone is not an appropriate treatment for acute hepatitis B; it is indicated for type 2 diabetes, lacks efficacy for HBV, carries label guidance against use with abnormal liver tests, and has postmarketing hepatic failure reports that heighten concern in acute liver injury. Management should instead follow standard, virus‑directed and supportive strategies as clinically indicated, while avoiding introduction of agents with potential hepatotoxicity in the acute phase [^115MLYCS] [^112TJ3Xt] [^113yDCEw].

Pioglitazone should not be used for acute hepatitis B because there is **no evidence of benefit** and a **risk of hepatotoxicity** [^115MLYCS] [^113yDCEw] [^1133AYDn]. Pioglitazone is **not indicated** for acute hepatitis B and **should be avoided** in patients with active liver disease or unexplained liver enzyme abnormalities [^112TJ3Xt] [^115S9Hhb]. Management of acute hepatitis B should follow **established antiviral and supportive care guidelines**.

---

## Mechanism of action and pharmacological profile

Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione (TZD) that **activates PPAR-γ**, improving insulin sensitivity and modulating glucose and lipid metabolism [^112kBuJE]. It is approved for type 2 diabetes and has been studied in NASH, but not for acute hepatitis B [^115MLYCS] [^114T6MNm] [^113s8z5c].

---

## Evidence regarding pioglitazone in acute hepatitis B

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting pioglitazone in acute hepatitis B; no trials or studies have evaluated its efficacy or safety in this setting.

---

## Hepatotoxicity and safety concerns

Pioglitazone has been associated with **hepatotoxicity**, including rare cases of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure [^113yDCEw] [^1133AYDn]. Postmarketing reports and case series describe serious liver injury, including mixed hepatocellular-cholestatic injury [^117P7FU3]. Given the active hepatic inflammation in acute hepatitis B, adding a potentially hepatotoxic drug is risky [^1143HuVF].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines **do not recommend pioglitazone** for acute hepatitis B; it is not indicated and should be avoided in patients with active liver disease or unexplained liver enzyme abnormalities.

---

## Alternative therapeutic options

Management of acute hepatitis B focuses on **supportive care and antiviral therapy** when indicated. For severe acute or fulminant hepatitis, recommended agents include entecavir or tenofovir. Pioglitazone is not part of standard care.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Pioglitazone should **not be used** for acute hepatitis B due to a lack of evidence and potential hepatotoxicity [^113yDCEw] [^1133AYDn]. Management should follow **established antiviral and supportive care guidelines**.

Pioglitazone

There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking pioglitazone, although the reports contain insufficient information to establish the probable cause. There has been no evidence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone-controlled clinical trial database at the time of writing [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Patients with type 2 diabetes may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure, both of which may cause liver test abnormalities. They may also have other forms of liver disease, many of which can be treated or managed. Therefore, obtaining a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) and assessing the patient is recommended before initiating Duetact therapy. In patients with abnormal liver tests, Duetact should be initiated with caution.

Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine, or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than 3 times the upper limit of the reference range), Duetact treatment should be interrupted and further investigation conducted to establish the probable cause. Duetact should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of pioglitazone/glimepiride PO (also known as Duetact):

- **Alf**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as pioglitazone has been associated with an increased risk of fatal and non-fatal liver failure.
- **Bladder cancer**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as pioglitazone has been associated with an increased risk of urinary bladder tumors.
- **Bone fracture**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as pioglitazone has been associated with an increased risk of fractures in females.
- **Cardiovascular mortality**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as the increased cardiovascular mortality risk observed with tolbutamide may also apply to other sulfonylureas.
- **Decreased blood glucose**: Use caution in patients at risk for hypoglycemia, including elderly patients, concomitant use of other hypoglycemic medications or alcohol, patients with renal, hepatic, adrenal, or pituitary impairment, malnutrition, calorie deficit, or after severe or prolonged exercise.
- **Exacerbation of edema**: Use caution in patients with edema.
- **Exacerbation of HF**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as thiazolidinediones have been associated with an increased risk of dose-related fluid retention leading to or exacerbating congestive HF. Start at 15 mg of pioglitazone in patients with systolic dysfunction.
- **Hemolytic anemia**: Use caution in patients with G6PD deficiency.
- **Macular edema**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as pioglitazone has been associated with an increased risk of macular edema.

### The effects of discontinuing pioglitazone in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^114rpJ15]. Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

A pilot study of a 48-week course of pioglitazone demonstrated significant improvements in the biochemical and histological features of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The aim of the study was to assess the effects of stopping pioglitazone. Twenty-one patients with NASH were treated with pioglitazone (30 mg/day) for 48 weeks and underwent baseline and end-of-treatment evaluation, including liver biopsy. Thirteen patients were followed for at least 48 weeks after stopping therapy, and 9 underwent repeat liver biopsy. Statistical comparisons were made to evaluate whether discontinuation of pioglitazone resulted in a reversal of improvements seen on therapy.

Stopping pioglitazone was associated with a subsequent elevation in serum alanine aminotransferase levels (from 34 ± 13 to 70 ± 39 IU/l), a decrease in adiponectin (from 9.7 ± 9.1 to 5.1 ± 4.5 microg/ml), worsening insulin sensitivity (HOMA Index: from 2.9 ± 1.8 to 5.5 ± 5.4), and an increase in total hepatic fat (from 30% ± 32% to 71% ± 33%) despite no change in average body weight compared to the end of treatment. Repeat liver biopsy in 9 patients revealed significant worsening of parenchymal inflammation (from 1.2 ± 0.7 to 2.9 ± 1.1) and steatosis (from 0.9 ± 0.6 to 2.1 ± 1.3), but no change in fibrosis (from 1.1 ± 1.2 to 1.2 ± 1.3). NASH was again present on liver biopsy in 7 patients.

These findings suggest that long-term therapy with pioglitazone may be necessary to maintain improvements in disease activity in patients with NASH, although weight gain during treatment may be a concern.

### A placebo-controlled trial of pioglitazone in subjects with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^114T6MNm]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). High credibility.

No pharmacologic therapy has conclusively proved to be effective for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, which is characterized by insulin resistance, steatosis, and necroinflammation with or without centrilobular fibrosis. Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that ameliorates insulin resistance and improves glucose and lipid metabolism in type 2 diabetes mellitus.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned 55 patients with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes and liver biopsy-confirmed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis to 6 months of treatment with a hypocaloric diet (a reduction of 500 kcal per day in relation to the calculated daily intake required to maintain body weight) plus pioglitazone (45 mg daily) or a hypocaloric diet plus placebo. Before and after treatment, we assessed hepatic histologic features, hepatic fat content by means of magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and glucose turnover during an oral glucose tolerance test (14Cglucose given with the oral glucose load and [3H]glucose given by intravenous infusion).

- **Results**: Diet plus pioglitazone, as compared with diet plus placebo, improved glycemic control and glucose tolerance (P < 0.001), normalized liver aminotransferase levels as it decreased plasma aspartate aminotransferase levels (by 40% vs. 21%, P = 0.04), decreased alanine aminotransferase levels (by 58% vs. 34%, P < 0.001), decreased hepatic fat content (by 54% vs. 0%, P < 0.001), and increased hepatic insulin sensitivity (by 48% vs. 14%, P = 0.008). Administration of pioglitazone, as compared with placebo, was associated with improvement in histo…

### Pathophysiologic approach to therapy in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes [^111HpCTF]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

In combination with metformin, which inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis, pioglitazone improves insulin sensitivity in the liver and muscle and preserves β-cell function. This offers an effective, durable, and additive therapy that retards progressive β-cell failure with little risk of hypoglycemia. In a 6-month trial comparing fixed-dose combinations of pioglitazone (30 mg) and metformin (1,700 mg) in 600 drug-naïve T2DM patients, HbA1c declined by 1.8% from a baseline HbA1c of 8.6%. This reduction was significantly greater than the 1.0% reduction observed with metformin alone or pioglitazone alone. Similar results were reported by Rosenstock et al. using initial combination therapy with rosiglitazone (8 mg) and metformin (2,000 mg).

Combining pioglitazone with a GLP-1 analog curbs the weight gain associated with TZD. Furthermore, the natriuretic effect of GLP-1 analogs mitigates against fluid retention observed with TZDs. Therefore, we advocate for combined GLP-1 analog and pioglitazone therapy with or without metformin in newly diagnosed T2DM patients.

Intensive therapy with insulin plus metformin aims for the reversal of metabolic decompensation. Newly diagnosed T2DM patients who present in poor metabolic control are markedly resistant to insulin and have severely impaired β-cell function. Glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, and multiple metabolic abnormalities play important roles in insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction. The institution of intensive insulin therapy, with or without other antidiabetes agents, to correct these many metabolic abnormalities represents a rational approach to therapy based on pathophysiology.

### Pioglitazone decreases fasting and postprandial endogenous glucose production in proportion to decrease in hepatic triglyceride content [^114J2EAv]. Diabetes (2008). Low credibility.

In keeping with our hypothesis, pioglitazone treatment in type 2 diabetes resulted in an approximate 50% decrease in hepatic triglyceride and a 55% reduction in muscle triglyceride, despite significant weight gain (approximately 6 kg). This was associated with a 26% decrease in fasting endogenous glucose production (EGP) and a twofold decrease in postprandial EGP. Hepatic triglyceride content was directly correlated with fasting EGP (r = 0.64, P = 0.01) and inversely correlated with percentage suppression of EGP at 150 minutes (r = −0.63, P = 0.02) before and after pioglitazone treatment. By stepwise regression, hepatic triglyceride was found to be a significant independent predictor of fasting EGP, accounting for 53% of its variation (P < 0.001). Similarly, hepatic triglyceride content accounted for 36% of the variation seen in the percentage suppression of postprandial EGP observed at 150 minutes (P = 0.03). In contrast, although muscle triglyceride content decreased with pioglitazone treatment, it did not correlate with EGP. There was no relationship between visceral fat content and EGP.

In type 2 diabetes, hepatic insulin resistance is believed to underlie the elevated basal rates of EGP and subnormal postprandial suppression of EGP. In a recent study, elevated EGP was found to be a primary mechanism for postprandial hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes. Hepatic triglyceride content is characteristically increased in type 2 diabetes and is an important predictor of hepatic insulin resistance, and this is true even independent of obesity. Additionally, hepatic triglyceride content correlated negatively with postprandial net.

### Oseni [^1144vjgh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The following adverse reactions have been identified during the postmarketing use of alogliptin or pioglitazone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

- **Alogliptin**:
	- **Gastrointestinal disorders**: Acute pancreatitis, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, ileus
	- **Hepatobiliary disorders**: Fulminant hepatic failure
	- **Immune system disorders**: Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis
	- **Investigations**: Hepatic enzyme elevations
	- **Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders**: Severe and disabling arthralgia, rhabdomyolysis
	- **Renal and urinary disorders**: Tubulointerstitial nephritis
	- **Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders**: Angioedema, rash, urticaria, and severe cutaneous adverse reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, bullous pemphigoid

- **Pioglitazone**:
	- **Cardiac disorders**: Rapid increases in weight, edema, congestive heart failure both with and without previously known heart disease or concomitant insulin administration
	- **Eye disorders**: New onset or worsening diabetic macular edema with decreased visual acuity
	- **Hepatobiliary disorders**: Fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure

### Oseni [^112EAidb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Patients with hepatic impairment can experience variations in drug exposure when using Oseni.

- **Alogliptin**: Total exposure to alogliptin was approximately 10% lower, and peak exposure was approximately 8% lower in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Grade B) compared to healthy subjects. The magnitude of these reductions is not considered clinically meaningful. Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Grade C) have not been studied. Use caution when administering Oseni to patients with liver disease [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **Pioglitazone**: Compared with healthy controls, subjects with impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Grade B and C) exhibit an approximate 45% reduction in pioglitazone and total pioglitazone (pioglitazone, M-III and M-IV) mean peak concentrations, but there is no change in the mean AUC values. Therefore, no dosage adjustment in patients with hepatic impairment is required. There are postmarketing reports of liver failure with pioglitazone, and clinical trials have generally excluded patients with serum ALT > 2.5 times the upper limit of the reference range. Use caution in patients with liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

### Substitution of pioglitazone for troglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetes [^112kwmGr]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

To evaluate the clinical utility of pioglitazone therapy in patients who previously received troglitazone, we undertook an observational study. Patients with type 2 diabetes initially treated with troglitazone were converted to pioglitazone therapy. Drug efficacy was evaluated by comparing baseline hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, weight, blood pressure, and lipid profiles (during troglitazone treatment) with corresponding values 6 months after final pioglitazone dose titration. Drug safety was assessed through a review of hepatic enzyme levels and documented reports of side effects.

The study cohort consisted of 316 patients. Pioglitazone therapy was initiated after they had received troglitazone for at least 1 year. Discontinuation of pioglitazone treatment occurred in 43 patients; in 7 additional patients, no follow-up occurred. We found no significant difference between baseline and follow-up mean HbA1c values. Aspartate aminotransferase levels did not significantly change after 6 months of pioglitazone therapy; however, alanine aminotransferase levels increased by a statistically significant 3.8 U/L (95% confidence interval, 2.6 to 4.9). Pioglitazone treatment was discontinued because of edema in 29 of the 309 evaluable patients (9.4%).

In conclusion, pioglitazone was as effective as troglitazone in maintaining HbA1c levels. The hepatic safety of pioglitazone was also demonstrated.

### Differentiating members of the thiazolidinedione class: A focus on efficacy [^114X8rxK]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

The thiazolidinediones (TZDs), also known as 'glitazones', are a new class of drugs used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Although their precise mechanism of action is not entirely known, TZDs target insulin resistance directly, addressing an underlying cause of the disease. In the United States, two TZDs are indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes: pioglitazone and rosiglitazone. A third, troglitazone, has been associated with significant hepatotoxicity and has been withdrawn from use.

In clinical trials, all three TZDs have effectively lowered blood glucose levels, both as monotherapy and in combination therapy with sulfonylureas, metformin, and insulin. At the time of writing, head-to-head comparative studies among these agents have not been performed. It is challenging, therefore, to make direct comparisons of their efficacy since other variables, including baseline glucose levels and study design, can significantly impact treatment outcomes.

Despite these challenges, and in light of unique safety issues associated with certain TZDs, it is useful to closely examine the efficacy data for these agents. It is insufficient to assume that 'all glitazones are the same' because the studies have not yet been conducted to support this statement. This article will review what is known about the relative efficacy of the TZDs.

### Pioglitazone decreases fasting and postprandial endogenous glucose production in proportion to decrease in hepatic triglyceride content [^112W2xkM]. Diabetes (2008). Low credibility.

Hepatic triglyceride has been shown to be strongly associated with hepatic insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. The exact mechanism by which hepatic triglyceride induces hepatic insulin resistance is unknown but is thought to relate to the accumulation of intracellular fatty acid metabolites and consequent activation of a serine kinase cascade and induction of cellular insulin resistance. Reduction in hepatic triglyceride content by moderate weight reduction normalizes rates of basal endogenous glucose production (EGP) in patients with type 2 diabetes. Hepatic insulin resistance is also associated with impaired postprandial suppression of EGP in type 2 diabetes, but the effect of reduction of hepatic triglyceride content on postprandial suppression of EGP in type 2 diabetes is unknown.

Thiazolidinediones, such as pioglitazone, possess insulin-sensitizing properties and have been shown to decrease hepatic triglyceride content in type 2 diabetes. Because thiazolidinediones have been shown to reduce both fasting and postprandial glucose levels, we hypothesized that pioglitazone treatment in type 2 diabetes would reduce hepatic triglyceride content and consequently reduce basal and postprandial EGP. In addition, visceral fat has also been implicated in hepatic insulin resistance, and pioglitazone has been reported to decrease visceral fat content. The effect of this on EGP requires definition.

To test our hypothesis, we used noninvasive 1 H magnetic resonance spectroscopy to assess hepatic triglyceride and intramyocellular triglyceride content and magnetic resonance imaging.

### A pilot study of pioglitazone treatment for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^1156Qv8s]. Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a common chronic liver disease for which there is no known effective therapy. A proportion of patients with NASH progress to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. NASH is considered one of the clinical features of the metabolic syndrome in which insulin resistance plays a central role. This prospective study evaluates the role of an insulin-sensitizing agent in the treatment of NASH. Eighteen nondiabetic patients with biopsy-proven NASH were treated with pioglitazone (30 mg daily) for 48 weeks. Tests of insulin sensitivity, body composition, and liver biopsies were performed before and at the end of treatment.

By 48 weeks, serum alanine aminotransferase values fell to normal in 72% of patients. Hepatic fat content and size, as determined by magnetic resonance imaging, decreased, and glucose and free fatty acid sensitivity to insulin were uniformly improved. Histological features of steatosis, cellular injury, parenchymal inflammation, Mallory bodies, and fibrosis were significantly improved from baseline (all P < 0.05). Using strict criteria, histological improvement occurred in two-thirds of patients. Pioglitazone was well tolerated; the main side effects were weight gain (averaging 4%) and an increase in total body adiposity.

In conclusion, these results indicate that treatment with an insulin-sensitizing agent can lead to improvement in biochemical and histological features of NASH and support the role of insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of this disease. The long-term safety and benefits of pioglitazone require further study.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^113hBbq6]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically concerning patients with diabetes mellitus, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend considering the use of pioglitazone to lower the risk of stroke or myocardial infarction. This recommendation is aimed at patients with a history of stroke and evidence of insulin resistance and prediabetes. However, it is critical to balance the benefits of pioglitazone with the potential increased risk of weight gain, edema, and fractures. Offering lower doses is advised as a strategy to mitigate the risk of adverse effects.

### Acute hepatitis C: Current status and remaining challenges [^1158mqGp]. Journal of Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

The acute phase of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection represents a key point in the evolution of hepatitis C. In some patients, the infection resolves spontaneously, whereas in others, it develops into chronic disease. However, because acute hepatitis C is often asymptomatic, detection and diagnosis are usually difficult. Furthermore, there are no established treatment guidelines, leaving physicians to make several challenging decisions, such as whether to treat, when to treat, and what treatment regimen to use. Pegylated interferon alfa monotherapy is most commonly used to treat patients with acute hepatitis C. The role of ribavirin has yet to be established.

In this review, we discuss the epidemiology of acute hepatitis C, its risk factors, routes of transmission, and treatment practices. We also examine data from published clinical studies and focus on unresolved issues for which additional studies are needed in order to establish standardized treatment guidelines for the management of acute hepatitis C.

### The effect of pioglitazone on the liver: Role of adiponectin [^112hs6Mo]. Diabetes Care (2006). Low credibility.

Diabetic hyperglycemia results from insulin resistance of peripheral tissues and glucose overproduction due to increased gluconeogenesis (GNG). Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) improve peripheral insulin sensitivity, but the effect on the liver is less clear. The goal of this study was to examine the effect of TZDs on GNG.

- **Research design and methods**: Twenty sulfonylurea-treated type 2 diabetic subjects were randomly assigned in a double-blind study to receive pioglitazone (PIO group; 45 mg/day) or placebo (Plc group) for 4 months. This was done to assess endogenous glucose production (EGP) using 3-(3)H-glucose infusion, GNG using the D2O technique, and insulin sensitivity by two-step hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (240 and 960 pmol/min per m2).

- **Results**: Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) decreased in the PIO group from 10.0 ± 0.8 to 7.7 ± 0.7 mmol/l and HbA1c decreased from 9.0 ± 0.4% to 7.3 ± 0.6%, while these parameters increased in the Plc group (P < 0.05 for PIO vs. Plc). Insulin sensitivity increased by approximately 40% during the high insulin clamp after pioglitazone administration (P < 0.01) and remained unchanged in the Plc group, indicating a significant difference (P < 0.05 for PIO vs. Plc). EGP did not change; however, GNG decreased in the PIO group from 9.6 ± 0.7 to 8.7 ± 0.6 micromol x min(-1) x kg(ffm)(-1), while it increased in the Plc group from 8.0 ± 0.5 to 9.6 ± 0.8 micromol x min(-1) x kg(ffm)(-1) (P < 0.05 for PIO vs. Plc). Changes in FPG correlated with changes in GNG flux (r = 0.63, P < 0.003) and insulin sensitivity (r = 0.59, P < 0.01). Plasma adiponectin increased after pioglitazone (P < 0.001) and correlated with changes in FPG (r = -0.54, P < 0.03), GNG flux (r = -0.47, P < 0.05), and insulin sensitivity.

### Long-term pioglitazone treatment for patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and prediabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus: A randomized trial [^111P6a58]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The metabolic defects of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and prediabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) seem to be specifically targeted by pioglitazone; however, information about its long-term use in this population is limited.

- **Objective**: To determine the efficacy and safety of long-term pioglitazone treatment in patients with NASH and prediabetes or T2DM.

- **Design**: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00994682).

- **Setting**: University hospital.

- **Participants**: Patients (n = 101) with prediabetes or T2DM and biopsy-proven NASH were recruited from the general population and outpatient clinics.

- **Intervention**: All patients were prescribed a hypocaloric diet (500-kcal/d deficit from weight-maintaining caloric intake) and then randomly assigned to pioglitazone, 45 mg/d, or placebo for 18 months, followed by an 18-month open-label phase with pioglitazone treatment.

- **Measurements**: The primary outcome was a reduction of at least 2 points in the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score in 2 histologic categories without worsening of fibrosis. Secondary outcomes included other histologic outcomes, hepatic triglyceride content measured by magnetic resonance and proton spectroscopy, and metabolic parameters.

- **Results**: Among patients randomly assigned to pioglitazone, 58% achieved the primary outcome (treatment difference, 41 percentage points [95% CI, 23 to 59 percentage points]) and 51% had resolution of NASH (treatment difference, 32 percentage points [CI, 13 to 51 percentage points]) (P < 0.001 for each).

### Pioglitazone stimulates apolipoprotein A-I production without affecting HDL removal in HepG2 cells: Involvement of PPAR-alpha [^112nofdB]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2007). Low credibility.

Pioglitazone, an antihyperglycemic drug, increases plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in patients with type 2 diabetes. The mechanisms by which pioglitazone regulates HDL levels are not clear. This study examined the effect of pioglitazone on hepatocyte apolipoprotein AI (apoA-I) and apoA-II production and HDL-protein/cholesterol ester uptake.

- **Methods and results**: In human hepatoblastoma (HepG2) cells, pioglitazone, dose-dependently (0.5 to 10 micromol/L), increased the de novo synthesis (up to 45%), secretion (up to 44%), and mRNA expression (up to 59%) of apoA-I. Pioglitazone also increased apoA-II de novo synthesis (up to 73%) and mRNA expression (up to 129%). Pioglitazone did not affect the uptake of HDL3-protein or HDL3-cholesterol ester in HepG2 cells. The pioglitazone-induced apoA-I lipoprotein particles increased cholesterol efflux from THP-1 macrophages. The pioglitazone-induced apoA-I secretion or mRNA expression by the HepG2 cells was abrogated with the suppression of PPAR-alpha by small interfering RNA or a specific inhibitor of PPAR-alpha, MK886.

- **Conclusions**: The data indicate that pioglitazone increases HDL by stimulating the de novo hepatic synthesis of apoA-I without affecting hepatic HDL-protein or HDL-cholesterol removal. We suggest that pioglitazone-mediated hepatic activation of PPAR-alpha may be one of the mechanisms of action of pioglitazone to raise hepatic apoA-I and HDL.

### Oseni [^1133AYDn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

There have been postmarketing reports of both fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking pioglitazone or alogliptin, although some reports lack sufficient information to establish the probable cause [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

In glycemic control trials involving patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were reported in 1.3% of patients treated with alogliptin 25 mg and 1.7% of those treated with active comparators or placebo. In the EXAMINE trial, which is a cardiovascular outcomes trial for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and high cardiovascular (CV) risk, increases in serum alanine aminotransferase three times the upper limit of the reference range occurred in 2.4% of patients treated with alogliptin and 1.8% of those treated with placebo.

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure, both of which may result in liver test abnormalities. They may also have other forms of liver disease, which can often be treated or managed. Therefore, obtaining a liver test panel (ALT, aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) and assessing the patient is recommended before initiating Oseni therapy. In patients with abnormal liver tests, Oseni should be initiated with caution.

Prompt measurement of liver tests is recommended for patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue and anorexia.

### Duetact [^116kW5X6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Hepatic impairment**: In subjects with impaired hepatic function (Child-Turcotte-Pugh Grade B/C), there is an approximate 45% reduction in pioglitazone and total pioglitazone (pioglitazone, M-III, and M-IV) mean Cmax, but no change in mean AUC values, compared with healthy controls. Therefore, no dose adjustment is required for patients with hepatic impairment. Postmarketing reports include liver failure with pioglitazone; clinical trials generally exclude patients with serum ALT levels greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of the reference range. Use Duetact with caution in patients with liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

- **Glimepiride**: The effect of hepatic impairment on glimepiride pharmacokinetics is unknown because it has not been adequately evaluated in such patients.

- **Geriatric patients**: In healthy elderly subjects, the Cmax of pioglitazone was not significantly different; however, AUC values were approximately 21% higher than those in younger subjects. The mean t½ was also prolonged in elderly subjects (about 10 hours) compared to younger subjects (about seven hours). These changes are not of a magnitude considered clinically relevant.

### Pioglitazone decreases fasting and postprandial endogenous glucose production in proportion to decrease in hepatic triglyceride content [^113Ro891]. Diabetes (2008). Low credibility.

Hepatic triglyceride is closely associated with hepatic insulin resistance and is known to be decreased by thiazolididinediones. We studied the effect of pioglitazone on hepatic triglyceride content and the consequent effect on postprandial endogenous glucose production (EGP) in type 2 diabetes.

- **Research design and methods**: Ten subjects with type 2 diabetes on sulfonylurea therapy were treated with pioglitazone (30 mg daily) for 16 weeks. EGP was measured using a dynamic isotopic methodology following a standard liquid test meal both before and after pioglitazone treatment. Liver and muscle triglyceride levels were measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and intra-abdominal fat content was measured by magnetic resonance imaging.

- **Results**: Pioglitazone treatment reduced mean plasma fasting glucose and mean peak postprandial glucose levels. Fasting EGP decreased after pioglitazone treatment (16.6 ± 1.0 vs. 12.2 ± 0.7 micromol. kg(-1). min(-1), P = 0.005). Between 80 and 260 minutes postprandially, EGP was twofold lower on pioglitazone (2.58 ± 0.25 vs. 1.26 ± 0.30 micromol. kg(-1). min(-1), P < 0.001). Hepatic triglyceride content decreased by approximately 50% (P = 0.03), and muscle (anterior tibialis) triglyceride content decreased by approximately 55% (P = 0.02). Hepatic triglyceride content was directly correlated with fasting EGP (r = 0.64, P = 0.01) and inversely correlated to percentage suppression of EGP (time 150 min, r = -0.63, P = 0.02). Muscle triglyceride, subcutaneous fat, and visceral fat content were not related to EGP.

- **Conclusions**: Redacted information follows.

### Efficacy and safety of pioglitazone add-on in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled with metformin and dapagliflozin: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115P1L9e]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

The primary findings demonstrated a significant reduction in HbA1c with pioglitazone add-on therapy, accompanied by substantially higher achievement rates of both HbA1c < 7% and < 6.5% targets. These improvements in glycaemic control were consistent across studies, as evidenced by the negligible heterogeneity in our analyses. The magnitude of HbA1c reduction likely reflects pioglitazone's complementary mechanism of action, enhancing insulin sensitivity through PPAR-γ activation while working synergistically with the glucose excretion effects of SGLT2 inhibitors and metformin's reduction of hepatic glucose production.

Secondary outcomes revealed meaningful improvements in several metabolic parameters, including fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), supporting pioglitazone's insulin-sensitising effects. As measured by HOMA-β, beta-cell function remained unchanged, suggesting that pioglitazone's primary mechanism operates through insulin sensitisation rather than beta-cell preservation.

The lipid profile remained largely stable, with no significant alterations in total cholesterol, LDL-C, or triglycerides. The observed increase in HDL-C aligns with pioglitazone's known beneficial effects on lipid metabolism. Notably, adding pioglitazone did not significantly impact most cardiovascular parameters, except for a modest reduction in diastolic blood pressure. The neutral effect on these parameters is particularly noteworthy, as it suggests that pioglitazone addition does not adversely affect the cardiovascular and metabolic benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors.

### Evaluation of liver function in type 2 diabetic patients during clinical trials: Evidence that rosiglitazone does not cause hepatic dysfunction [^114rvP12]. Diabetes Care (2002). Low credibility.

Troglitazone treatment has been associated with idiosyncratic hepatic reactions leading to hepatic failure and death in some patients. This raises questions regarding whether all thiazolidinediones or peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonists are hepatotoxic and whether data from clinical trials are adequate to detect a signal of potentially serious drug-related hepatotoxicity. The purpose of this study was to assess whether the idiosyncratic liver toxicity reported with troglitazone is molecule-specific or a thiazolidinedione class effect, based on liver enzyme data collected prospectively during phase 2/3 clinical trials with rosiglitazone, a new, potent, and specific member of the thiazolidinedione class.

- **Research design and methods**: This study involved an analysis of liver function in type 2 diabetic patients at baseline and serially in 13 double-blind, 2 open-label active-controlled, and 7 open-label extension studies of rosiglitazone treatment. These were conducted in outpatient centers throughout North America and Europe. The study comprised over 6,000 patients aged 30–80 years with type 2 diabetes. Patients underwent baseline liver function studies and were excluded from clinical trials if they had alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or alkaline phosphatase values 2.5 times greater than the upper limit of the reference range. The main outcome measures were liver enzyme levels, which were assessed at screening, at baseline, every 4 weeks for the first 3 months of treatment, and at 6- to 12-week intervals thereafter.

### Mixed hepatocellular-cholestatic liver injury after pioglitazone therapy [^117P7FU3]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Pioglitazone is an oral hypoglycemic agent in the thiazolidinedione class. Only one case of hepatotoxicity related to this agent has previously been reported.

- **Objective**: To report the clinical course of a patient with hepatitis after therapy with pioglitazone.

- **Design**: Case report.

- **Setting**: A community hospital.

- **Patient**: A 49-year-old diabetic man taking pioglitazone, 30 mg/d.

- **Intervention**: Discontinuation of pioglitazone therapy.

- **Measurements**: Serum aminotransferase and bilirubin levels, standard blood tests for causes of hepatitis and cirrhosis other than drug toxicity, and liver biopsy.

- **Results**: After 6 months of pioglitazone therapy, significant hepatic dysfunction developed. Blood tests excluded viral, metabolic, and autoimmune disorders. Liver biopsy showed mixed hepatocellular-cholestatic injury compatible with drug toxicity. After treatment with pioglitazone was discontinued, liver enzyme values returned to normal.

- **Conclusion**: Patients receiving pioglitazone may develop serious liver injury and should be observed for evidence of hepatitis.

### Thiazolidinediones and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and the risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: A cohort study [^115SJUJC]. Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Exposure to glucose‐lowering agents: Follow‐up time was divided into fixed intervals of 90 days, starting from the index date. Based on the time since the most recent oral glucose‐lowering drug prescription, an interval was classified as "use" (≤ 90 days) or "past use" (> 90 days). All patients were users of one of the eligible drugs at the index date, and they could move between past and use during follow‐up.

- **Use classification based on comparison with TZDs and SUs**: Use was classified into the following mutually exclusive groups when comparing the use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) with sulfonylureas (SUs): use of SUs, use of TZDs, concurrent use (conUse) of TZDs and SUs, use of dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DPP‐4) inhibitors, and use of other glucose‐lowering agents (other than TZDs, SUs, and DPP‐4 inhibitors). At the start of each TZD interval, the cumulative prescribed TZD dosage, in pioglitazone equivalents, was reviewed. Defined daily doses were used to calculate the pioglitazone dose equivalents.

- **Use classification based on comparison with GLP‐1 receptor agonists and insulins**: Use was classified into the following mutually exclusive groups when comparing the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP‐1) receptor agonists with insulins: use of insulins, use of GLP‐1 receptor agonists, concurrent use (conUse) of insulins and GLP‐1 receptor agonists, and use of other glucose‐lowering agents (other than insulins and GLP‐1 receptor agonists).

Users of SUs or insulins were chosen as the reference groups in our primary analyses because we anticipated that users of these agents would have the most comparable disease profiles.

### Do we still need pioglitazone for the treatment of type 2 diabetes? A risk-benefit critique in 2013 [^112gLJ69]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

An updated algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy for the management of hyperglycemia has been published as a position statement of the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes. According to this position statement, "pioglitazone appeared to have a modest benefit on CV events as a secondary outcome in one large trial involving patients with overt macrovascular disease". In the proposed algorithm, pioglitazone monotherapy can be considered an alternative to metformin monotherapy if metformin cannot be used (not tolerated or is contraindicated). It can also be used as a combination therapy if monotherapy with metformin alone does not achieve or maintain an HbA1c target, or as part of a triple combination therapy, provided that oral agents with complementary mechanisms of action are used. Thus, pioglitazone remains an effective and useful antidiabetes drug with a unique insulin-sensitizing action. However, the clinical use of pioglitazone is currently under scrutiny because of safety issues and the availability of newer drugs (DPP-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, and sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors). None of these newer drug classes target insulin resistance, however.

At the moment, the most insulin-resistant patients — identifiable by an increased waist circumference, low HDL cholesterol level, and fatty liver — may be the best candidates for treatment with pioglitazone. In addition, patients with a high risk or history of CVD are also likely to benefit from pioglitazone. It is our belief that pioglitaz…

### Duetact [^111yYTdC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Duetact combines two antihyperglycemic agents with different mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: pioglitazone, a member of the thiazolidinedione class, and glimepiride, a member of the sulfonylurea class. Thiazolidinediones are insulin-sensitizing agents that act primarily by enhancing peripheral glucose utilization, whereas sulfonylureas are insulin secretagogues that act primarily by stimulating the release of insulin from functioning pancreatic beta cells.

- **Pioglitazone**: Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that depends on the presence of insulin for its mechanism of action. It decreases insulin resistance in the periphery and the liver, resulting in increased insulin-dependent glucose disposal and decreased hepatic glucose output. Importantly, pioglitazone is not an insulin secretagogue. It acts as an agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ). PPAR receptors are found in tissues important for insulin action, such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. Activation of PPARγ nuclear receptors modulates the transcription of several insulin-responsive genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism.

In animal models of diabetes, pioglitazone reduces the hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia characteristic of insulin-resistant states such as type 2 diabetes. The metabolic changes produced by pioglitazone result in increased responsiveness of insulin-dependent tissues and are observed in numerous animal models of insulin resistance.

### Physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling suggests limited drug-drug interaction between clopidogrel and dasabuvir [^1154VXN4]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Simulation of clopidogrel with pioglitazone, using the Tornio et al. model assumptions, resulted in an overprediction (AUC ratio 3-fold) of the observed 2-fold AUC ratio of pioglitazone. A key assumption in Tornio's model was a 19-fold hepatic uptake factor for the acyl-β-D glucuronide, which was used to fit the observed DDI with repaglinide. Therefore, a sensitivity analysis was performed on this parameter to improve the model prediction of the pioglitazone interaction data. Results of the sensitivity analysis suggested that pioglitazone C max and AUC ratios could be accurately predicted by decreasing the hepatic uptake factor of clopidogrel acyl-β-D glucuronide from 19-fold to 5-fold.

- **Parameter sensitivity analysis**: This analysis is depicted in Figure 3, showing the clopidogrel acyl-β-D glucuronide hepatic uptake factor and its impact on the pioglitazone AUC ratio. The gray bar corresponds to the observed AUC ratio of pioglitazone when coadministered with clopidogrel (Kim et al.). The Simcyp virtual trial design included clopidogrel 300 mg administered on day 1 at 8:00, followed by 75 mg q.d. on days 2 and 3 at the same time, while pioglitazone 15 mg was administered on day 1 at 9:00. A population representative was used for the sensitivity analysis in Simcyp v14.1.

Based on these findings, simulations using the updated clopidogrel model with a hepatic uptake factor of 5-fold, and the repaglinide model file from the Simcyp substrate library, were performed. As expected, the simulations showed an underprediction of the observed C max and AUC ratios of repaglinide.

### Pioglitazone, vitamin E, or placebo for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^114FDU6C]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is a common liver disease that can progress to cirrhosis. Currently, there is no established treatment for this disease.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned 247 adults with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and without diabetes to receive pioglitazone at a dose of 30 mg daily (80 subjects), vitamin E at a dose of 800 IU daily (84 subjects), or placebo (83 subjects) for 96 weeks. The primary outcome was an improvement in histologic features of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, as assessed with the use of a composite of standardized scores for steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocellular ballooning, and fibrosis. Given the two planned primary comparisons, P values of less than 0.025 were considered to indicate statistical significance.

- **Results**: Vitamin E therapy, as compared with placebo, was associated with a significantly higher rate of improvement in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (43% vs. 19%, P = 0.001), but the difference in the rate of improvement with pioglitazone as compared with placebo was not significant (34% and 19%, respectively; P = 0.04). Serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferase levels were reduced with vitamin E and with pioglitazone, as compared with placebo (P < 0.001 for both comparisons), and both agents were associated with reductions in hepatic steatosis (P = 0.005 for vitamin E and P < 0.001 for pioglitazone) and lobular inflammation (P = 0.02 for vitamin E and P = 0.004 for pioglitazone), but not with improvement in fibrosis scores (P = 0.24 for vitamin E and P = 0.12 for pioglitazone). Subjects who received pioglitazone gained more wei

### Rethinking pioglitazone as a cardioprotective agent: A new perspective on an overlooked drug [^114cmfun]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Low credibility.

Early after their approval for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in 1985, the insulin-sensitizing agents thiazolidinediones (TDZs) — pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, and troglitazone — displayed alleged safety concerns about fluid retention and increased risk of developing heart failure (HF), ischemic heart disease, and liver toxicity, not all substantiated by later observations, leading to troglitazone and rosiglitazone withdrawal and subsequent reinstatements.

Moreover, concerns related to potential adverse effects of pioglitazone, including weight gain, bladder cancer, and decreased bone mineral density with increased risk of fractures, have led to a progressive and sustained decline in pioglitazone prescriptions. Nevertheless, treatment with pioglitazone is still available in most countries, is cost-effective, and has gained renewed popularity after novel favorable evidence emerged.

- **SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists**: Especially after the discovery of the cardioprotective effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 receptor agonists, the T2D treatment paradigm has faced a Copernican revolution, now also focusing on non-glycemic, cardioprotective effects of glucose-lowering agents, including the oldest ones.

Despite the initial aversion due to increased HF risk, several studies have examined the complex metabolic and biological roles of pioglitazone in many cardiovascular diseases. Experimental and human data suggest beneficial effects on the vascular system, including delayed atherosclerosis progression and reduced cardiovascular events.

### Pioglitazone decreases fasting and postprandial endogenous glucose production in proportion to decrease in hepatic triglyceride content [^116qHERL]. Diabetes (2008). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: Hepatic triglyceride is closely associated with hepatic insulin resistance and is known to be decreased by thiazolidinediones. This study investigated the effect of pioglitazone on hepatic triglyceride content and its consequent effect on postprandial endogenous glucose production (EGP) in type 2 diabetes.

- **Research design and methods**: Ten subjects with type 2 diabetes on sulfonylurea therapy were treated with pioglitazone (30 mg daily) for 16 weeks. EGP was measured using a dynamic isotopic methodology following a standard liquid test meal, both before and after pioglitazone treatment. Liver and muscle triglyceride levels were measured by 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and intra-abdominal fat content was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging.

- **Results**: Pioglitazone treatment reduced mean plasma fasting glucose and mean peak postprandial glucose levels. Fasting EGP decreased post-treatment (16.6 ± 1.0 vs. 12.2 ± 0.7 μmol · kg⁻¹ · min⁻¹, P = 0.005). Between 80 and 260 minutes postprandially, EGP was twofold lower on pioglitazone (2.58 ± 0.25 vs. 1.26 ± 0.30 μmol · kg⁻¹ · min⁻¹, P < 0.001). Hepatic triglyceride content decreased by approximately 50% (P = 0.03), and muscle (anterior tibialis) triglyceride content decreased by approximately 55% (P = 0.02). Hepatic triglyceride content showed a direct correlation with fasting EGP (r = 0.64, P = 0.01) and an inverse correlation to the percentage suppression of EGP at 150 minutes (r = −0.63, P = 0.02). Muscle triglyceride, subcutaneous fat, and visceral fat content were not related to EGP.

- **Conclusions**: Reduction in hepatic triglyceride by pioglitazone effectively decreases both fasting and postprandial endogenous glucose production in type 2 diabetes.

### Randomized, placebo-controlled trial of pioglitazone in nondiabetic subjects with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^112JiRxk]. Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a leading cause of chronic liver disease for which there is limited therapy available. The insulin-sensitizing, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic properties of thiazolidinediones support their use in treating NASH. This study evaluates pioglitazone in the treatment of nondiabetic patients with NASH.

- **Methods**: Seventy-four nondiabetic patients (45 men; median age, 54 years) with histologically proven NASH were randomized to receive standard diet and exercise along with either placebo or pioglitazone (30 mg/day) for 12 months. Liver biopsies were conducted on sixty-one patients (30 placebo, 31 pioglitazone) at the beginning and end of the study.

- **Results**: Compared with the placebo group, pioglitazone therapy was associated with an increase in weight (mean change, -0.55 vs. +2.77 kg; p = 0.04) and reductions in glucose (+0.4 vs. -0.1 mmol/L; p = 0.02), HbA1c (+0.16% vs. -0.18%; p = 0.006), insulin C peptide level (+42 vs. -78 pmol/L; p = 0.02), alanine aminotransferase level (-10.9 vs. -36.2 U/L; p = 0.009), gamma-glutamyltransferase level (-9.4 vs. -41.2 U/L; p = 0.002), and ferritin (-11.3 vs. -90.5 µg/L; p = 0.01). Histologic features, including hepatocellular injury (P = .005), Mallory-Denk bodies (P = .004), and fibrosis (P = .05), also showed reductions in patients treated with pioglitazone compared with those in the placebo group.

- **Conclusions**: Pioglitazone therapy over a 12-month period in nondiabetic subjects with NASH resulted in improvements in metabolic and histologic parameters, most notably liver injury and fibrosis. Larger extended trials are justified to assess the long-term effects.

### Actos [^112kBuJE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Actos is a thiazolidinedione that requires the presence of insulin to exert its effects. It works by decreasing insulin resistance in peripheral tissues and the liver, which leads to increased insulin-dependent glucose disposal and decreased hepatic glucose output. Pioglitazone, the active ingredient in Actos, is not an insulin secretagogue. It functions as an agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ). PPAR receptors are located in tissues crucial for insulin action such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. Activation of PPARγ nuclear receptors influences the transcription of several insulin-responsive genes involved in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism.

In animal models of diabetes, pioglitazone reduces the hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia associated with insulin-resistant states like type 2 diabetes. The metabolic changes induced by pioglitazone result in increased responsiveness of insulin-dependent tissues and are observed across various animal models of insulin resistance.

Because pioglitazone enhances the effects of circulating insulin by decreasing insulin resistance, it does not lower blood glucose in animal models that lack endogenous insulin.

### Thiazolidinediones and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and the risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: A cohort study [^116f2EZ1]. Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

The risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in users of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) were examined. Overall, 2,526 patients were diagnosed with NAFLD during follow-up; 616 of these events occurred in the sulfonylurea (SU) use group and 18 in the TZD use group. Use of TZDs was associated with a decreased risk of NAFLD when compared with the use of SUs, with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 0.32 (95% confidence interval, 0.20‐0.51). Stratification of TZDs by cumulative dose as a proxy for duration resulted in a significantly decreased risk of NAFLD in all categories (< 5.4, 5.4‐21.8, ≥ 21.9 g pioglitazone). However, the number of events was very low in these subgroups.

- **Combined use of TZDs and SUs**: Combined use was also associated with a decreased risk of NAFLD when compared with the use of SUs only (aHR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.36‐0.87).

- **Postmarketing experience**: The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of pioglitazone and glimepiride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

- **Pioglitazone**:

- New onset or worsening diabetic macular edema with decreased visual acuity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].
- Fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Postmarketing reports of congestive heart failure have been reported in patients treated with pioglitazone, both with and without previously known heart disease and both with and without concomitant insulin administration.

In postmarketing experience, there have been reports of unusually rapid increases in weight and increases in excess of that generally observed in clinical trials. Patients who experience such increases should be assessed for fluid accumulation and volume-related events, such as excessive edema and congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Pharmacogenomic studies of current antidiabetic agents and potential new drug targets for precision medicine of diabetes [^112cdPk5]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

Thiazolidinediones, a class of peripheral insulin sensitizers consisting of pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, cooperate with nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) in peripheral tissue. They mediate the transcription of genes related to glucose metabolism, which enhances peripheral tissue sensitivity to insulin, thereby lowering blood glucose levels. Thiazolidinediones modulate glucose but do not target pancreatic islet β-cells.

- **Thiazolidinediones and transporter gene**: SLCO1B1 encodes the hepatic drug transporter OATP1B1, which may participate in transporting thiazolidinediones from the blood into the liver and plays a role in thiazolidinedione metabolism. The SLCO1B1 521T > C variant shows a substantial association with an enhanced glycemic response in rosiglitazone-treated patients with T2D. However, no statistically significant difference has been found in the pharmacokinetics of thiazolidinediones in healthy volunteers.

- **Thiazolidinediones and target gene**: PPARγ is a nuclear hormone receptor encoded by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ gene (PPARG). The Pro12Ala (rs1801282) polymorphism is the most common variation in the PPARG and is an associated risk factor for T2D. A potential association between the Pro12Ala polymorphism and a better therapeutic response to pioglitazone has been consistently reported in different populations, including those from South India, China, Iran, and menopausal women in Mexico. However, some studies demonstrate statistically non-significant differences between the response to thiazolidinediones in various demographic groups.

### Lessons from the glitazones: A story of drug development [^111xCezb]. Lancet (2001). Low credibility.

Troglitazone, the first in the thiazolidinedione class of oral hypoglycemic agents, was launched in the United States in March 1997. It reached Europe later that year, only to be withdrawn within weeks due to liver toxicity. Meanwhile, it went on to generate sales of over $2 billion in the United States and caused at least 90 cases of liver failure, including 70 resulting in death or transplantation, before it was withdrawn in March 2000. Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone reached the US market in 1999 as first-line agents to be used alone or in combination with other drugs. However, in Europe, the same dossiers were used one year later to apply for a limited license as second-line agents restricted to oral combination therapy.

How should we use the glitazones, and how did they achieve blockbuster status without any clear evidence of advantage over existing therapy?

### Importance of changes in adipose tissue insulin resistance to histological response during thiazolidinedione treatment of patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^116iSGfQ]. Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Pioglitazone treatment improves insulin resistance (IR), glucose metabolism, hepatic steatosis, and necroinflammation in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Because abnormal lipid metabolism and elevated plasma free fatty acids (FFAs) are important to the pathophysiology of NASH, we examined the impact of pioglitazone therapy on adipose tissue insulin resistance (Adipo-IR) during the treatment of patients with NASH.

We assessed glucose and lipid metabolism in 47 patients with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes mellitus and NASH, and compared them to 20 nondiabetic controls. All individuals underwent a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), during which we measured glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and suppression of plasma FFAs. We also measured the Adipo-IR index (fasting FFAs x insulin), hepatic fat by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and liver histology through liver biopsy.

Patients were randomized in a double-blind manner to either diet plus pioglitazone (45 mg/day) or placebo for 6 months, and all measurements were repeated. We found that patients with NASH had severe Adipo-IR and low adiponectin levels. Fasting FFAs were increased, and their suppression during the OGTT was impaired. Adipo-IR was strongly associated with hepatic fat (r = 0.54) and reduced glucose clearance both fasting (r = 0.34) and during the OGTT (r = 0.40, all P < 0.002).

Pioglitazone significantly improved glucose tolerance, glucose clearance, steatosis, and necroinflammation (all P < 0.01–0.001 versus placebo). Fasting and postprandial plasma FFAs decreased to levels comparable to controls with pioglitazone (P < 0.02 versus placebo).

Renal impairment: The serum elimination half-life of pioglitazone, M-III, and M-IV remains unchanged in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance [CLcr] 30 to 50 mL/min) and severe (CLcr 2.5 times the upper limit of the reference range) renal impairment. Use caution in patients with liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Geriatric patients: In healthy elderly subjects, the Cmax of pioglitazone was not significantly different, but AUC values were approximately 21% higher than those achieved in younger subjects. The mean t1/2 of pioglitazone was also prolonged in elderly subjects (about ten hours) as compared to younger subjects (about seven hours). These changes were not of a magnitude that would be considered clinically relevant.

Pediatric patients: Safety and efficacy of pioglitazone in pediatric patients have not been established. ACTOS is not recommended for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

### Comparison of pioglitazone with other antidiabetic drugs for associated incidence of liver failure: no evidence of increased risk of liver failure with pioglitazone [^111oaUhu]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of liver failure in association with antidiabetic treatment using pioglitazone versus other oral antidiabetic medications.

The study was a retrospective analysis of claim data from the PharMetrics Patient-Centric Database, which included over 1.12 million enrollees with type 2 diabetes. All patients aged 18 years or older with type 2 diabetes, who had initiated treatment with either a thiazolidinedione (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone), sulfonylurea, or metformin, were identified and matched based on propensity scores. These scores served as a proxy for the severity of the disease. The primary measure of interest was the incidence of liver failure or hepatitis post-index date. In addition to unadjusted comparisons, Cox proportional hazard models were employed to estimate the risk of developing liver failure or hepatitis.

There was no significant difference in the 1- and 2-year incidence rates of liver failure or hepatitis (primary and secondary diagnoses) between the pioglitazone monotherapy group and the respective comparator groups. In Cox proportional hazard models controlling for age, pre-index total healthcare costs, Charlson comorbidity index, procedures, and a hospitalization or ER visit for pre-index hyperglycemia, pioglitazone was not associated with an increased risk of liver failure or hepatitis compared to all other defined groups. Furthermore, no primary or secondary diagnosis of liver failure was reported in the pioglitazone group during the follow-up period.

### Pioglitazone in chronic hepatitis C not responding to pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin [^113wLcVs]. Journal of Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

The study aimed to investigate the effects of improving insulin sensitivity as a means to enhance the response to interferon alfa-based therapy for chronic hepatitis C patients. There is an observed relationship between insulin resistance and reduced treatment response.

- **Methods**: A multicenter clinical trial, termed the INSPIRED-HCV study, was initiated. The trial involved retreating chronic hepatitis C patients, who previously did not respond to the pegylated interferon alfa/ribavirin combination therapy. These patients were treated with a triple therapy that included the same antivirals in addition to an insulin-sensitizer, pioglitazone.

- **Results**: Out of the first five patients meeting the inclusion criteria, none achieved a satisfactory virological response after 12 weeks of retreatment. Notably, at least three patients showed improved insulin resistance scores. Due to these results, the study was concluded early.

- **Conclusions**: To improve insulin sensitivity prior to the retreatment of chronic hepatitis C patients with insulin resistance, different treatment schedules should be explored.

Pioglitazone

Clinical studies demonstrate that pioglitazone improves insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant patients. Pioglitazone enhances cellular responsiveness to insulin, increases insulin-dependent glucose disposal, and improves hepatic sensitivity to insulin. In patients with type 2 diabetes, the decreased insulin resistance produced by pioglitazone results in lower plasma glucose concentrations, lower plasma insulin concentrations, and lower HbA1c values. In controlled clinical trials, pioglitazone had an additive effect on glycemic control when used in combination with a sulfonylurea, metformin, or insulin [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Patients with lipid abnormalities were included in clinical trials with pioglitazone. Overall, patients treated with pioglitazone had mean decreases in serum triglycerides, mean increases in HDL cholesterol, and no consistent mean changes in LDL and total cholesterol. There is no conclusive evidence of macrovascular benefit with pioglitazone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In a 26-week, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging monotherapy study, mean serum triglycerides decreased in the 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg pioglitazone dose groups compared to a mean increase in the placebo group. Mean HDL cholesterol increased to a greater extent in patients treated with pioglitazone than in the placebo-treated patients. There were no consistent differences for LDL and total cholesterol in patients treated with pioglitazone compared to placebo.

### Empagliflozin improves liver steatosis and fibrosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and type 2 diabetes: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^116kFnHy]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

Although this was the first study comparing the effect of empagliflozin with pioglitazone in patients with T2DM and NAFLD, our study has some limitations. We did not perform liver biopsy as the gold standard to evaluate the status of NAFLD. There was also a relatively large number of drop-outs for various reasons (including COVID-19) in all three groups during the study, which may have decreased the statistical power. However, to address this problem, we repeated the analysis after inclusion of the existing drop-outs and missing data, which showed similar results. Moreover, a longer duration of treatment might be necessary to ascertain effects.

The strength of the study includes a reasonable male-to-female ratio of those completing the study (39–52% males) and the fact that the trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Finally, all the non-invasive measurements were carried out by the same individual blinded to the study arm of the participants.

### Pioglitazone decreases plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein mass, associated with a decrease in hepatic triglyceride content, in patients with type 2 diabetes [^11569BLF]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Hepatic steatosis is a prevalent condition in patients with type 2 diabetes and is associated with an increased cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, many patients with type 2 diabetes display dyslipidemia characterized by high plasma levels of apolipoprotein (apo) B-lipoproteins and triglycerides and low plasma levels of HDL cholesterol. Recently, Toledo et al. showed that hepatic steatosis is associated with more severe hyperlipidemia in type 2 diabetes, which might contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

To reduce this increased cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes, regular treatment algorithms include lipid-lowering drugs. Our previous studies in APOE*3-Leiden.CETP transgenic mice, a well-established model for human-like lipoprotein metabolism, showed that treatment with either statins, fibrates, or niacin resulted in a reduction in plasma apoB-lipoproteins and triglyceride levels and an increase in HDL cholesterol. Moreover, these treatments reduced hepatic lipid content (i.e. both triglycerides and cholesterol) as well as the hepatic expression and plasma levels of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). CETP is a protein that mediates the heteroexchange of cholesteryl esters from HDL to (V)LDL with a simultaneous exchange of triglycerides from (V)LDL to HDL. These studies thus suggest that lowering hepatic lipid content in APOE*3-Leiden.CETP mice increased HDL cholesterol levels by reduction of plasma CETP mass.

Because the correlation between hepatic triglyceride content and plasma CETP mass has not been studied in humans, the aim of this research was to investigate this relationship and its implications for cardiovascular risk management in patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^117GEDfy]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to patients with stroke, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend considering offering pioglitazone to lower the risk of stroke or myocardial infarction in patients with a history of stroke and evidence of insulin resistance and prediabetes, while balancing the benefits with the increased risk of weight gain, edema, and fractures. Consider offering lower doses to mitigate the risk of adverse effects.

### Thiazolidinediones and advanced liver fibrosis in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: A meta-analysis [^113s8z5c]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is projected to become the leading cause of liver transplantation by 2020. Advanced fibrosis (stage F3-F4) on liver biopsy is an independent predictor of all-cause and liver-related mortality in NASH. Currently, there are no known efficacious treatments for advanced fibrosis related to NASH; however, thiazolidinedione therapy has been extensively evaluated, and new randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have been completed to assess its efficacy.

The objective of this study was to synthesize evidence regarding the association of thiazolidinedione therapy with advanced liver fibrosis in NASH. The data for this meta-analysis was sourced from MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, clinicaltrials.gov, PubMed, and Scopus databases (without language restrictions), along with other registries and scientific meeting presentations, covering the inception of these databases through August 15, 2016.

- **Study selection**: Randomized clinical trials were included if they evaluated the effect of thiazolidinedione therapy on histologic features of the liver in biopsy-proven NASH.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Two investigators independently and in duplicate extracted study data and assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool.

The main outcomes and measures focused on a dichotomous improvement in advanced fibrosis on liver biopsy, defined as an improvement from fibrosis stage F3-F4 to F0-F2. Secondary outcomes included at least a 1-point improvement in fibrosis of any stage and resolution of NASH. This meta-analysis also evaluated the adverse effects of thiazolidinedione therapy, including weight gain, lower limb edema, and congestive symptoms.

### Do thiazolidinediones still have a role in treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^115vedk4]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Thiazolidinediones have been introduced in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) since the late 1990s. Although troglitazone was withdrawn from the market a few years later due to liver toxicity, both rosiglitazone and pioglitazone gained widespread use for T2DM treatment.

In 2010, however, due to an increased risk of cardiovascular events associated with its use, the European Medicines Agency recommended suspension of rosiglitazone use, and the Food and Drug Administration severely restricted its use. Thus, pioglitazone is the only thiazolidinedione still significantly employed for treating T2DM, and it is the only molecule of this class still listed in the American Diabetes Association-European Association for the Study of Diabetes 2012 Position Statement.

However, as with the other thiazolidinediones, the use of pioglitazone is limited by several side effects, some of which are potentially dangerous. This, together with the development of novel therapeutic strategies approved in the last couple of years, has made it questionable whether or not thiazolidinediones (namely pioglitazone) should still be used in the treatment of T2DM. This article will attempt to formulate an answer to this question by critically reviewing the available data on the numerous advantages and the potentially worrying shortcomings of pioglitazone treatment in T2DM.

### Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and hepatitis C virus [^116pwuj2]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance is higher among people chronically infected with hepatitis C (CHC) when compared with the general population and individuals with other causes of chronic liver disease. Both insulin resistance and diabetes are associated with adverse outcomes across all stages of CHC, including in the liver transplant population. CHC is also associated with the development of hepatic steatosis, a common histological feature present in approximately 55% (ranging from 32% to 81%) of cases.

There is a complex interrelationship between insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis, and both are postulated to aggravate each other. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear factors involved in the regulation of glucose and lipid homeostasis, inflammatory response, cell differentiation, and cell cycle. The relationship between hepatitis C virus replication and PPARs has been the focus of recent study. Given the availability of potent agonists, PPARs may represent a novel pharmacological target in the treatment of CHC.

### Oseni [^111EGnjM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

There has been no evidence of pioglitazone-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database at the time of writing. One randomized, double-blind, three-year trial compared pioglitazone to glyburide as an add-on to metformin and insulin therapy. This trial specifically evaluated the incidence of serum ALT elevation to greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range, measured every eight weeks for the first 48 weeks of the trial and then every 12 weeks thereafter. In total, 3 out of 1051 (0.3%) patients treated with pioglitazone and 9 out of 1046 (0.9%) patients treated with glyburide developed ALT values greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range. None of the patients treated with pioglitazone in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database at the time of writing had a serum ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range along with a corresponding total bilirubin greater than two times the upper limit of the reference range, a combination predictive of the potential for severe drug-induced liver injury.

- **Hypoglycemia**: In the pioglitazone clinical trials, adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were reported based on the clinical judgment of the investigators and did not require confirmation with finger stick glucose testing. In the 16-week add-on to sulfonylurea trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3.7% with pioglitazone 30 mg and 0.5% with placebo. In the 16-week add-on to insulin trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 7.9% with pioglitazone 15 mg, 15.4% with pioglitazone 30 mg, and 4.8% with placebo.

### Comparison of effects of thiazolidinediones on cardiovascular risk factors: Observations from a clinical practice [^116kg529]. Endocrine Practice (2001). Low credibility.

To compare short-term glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), lipid, weight, tolerability, and hepatic effects after switching patients with type 2 diabetes from troglitazone to either pioglitazone or rosiglitazone treatment, this study evaluated patients in a clinical setting.

The methods involved comparing the effects of converting from maintenance troglitazone therapy to either pioglitazone or rosiglitazone. HbA1c, lipids, weight, adverse effects, and hepatic status were monitored, assuming no other major therapeutic changes had been made. Of 163 study candidates, 144 and 125 patients met the criteria for comparison of HbA1c and lipids, respectively.

- **Results**: HbA1c decreased an absolute mean of 0.08% for each treatment group after an average of 3.2 months. Mean cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels decreased in the pioglitazone group by 4.7%, 11.3%, and 7.3%, respectively, but increased 8.4%, 38.4%, and 8.1%, respectively, in the rosiglitazone group. Mean high-density lipoprotein (HDL) increased by 2.6% with pioglitazone and decreased by 6.3% with rosiglitazone therapy. Patients receiving a statin concomitantly when switched to rosiglitazone had a 51.9% mean triglyceride increase versus a 25.7% increase for those not taking a statin, whereas patients switched to pioglitazone had respective decreases of 14.2% and 6.2%. Both drugs were generally well-tolerated; patients in both groups showed similar slight weight increases and no hepatic dysfunction.

### Pioglitazone decreases plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein mass, associated with a decrease in hepatic triglyceride content, in patients with type 2 diabetes [^112X64JZ]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

At baseline, patients in both treatment groups were well-matched for age (pioglitazone: 56.8 ± 1.0 years; metformin: 56.4 ± 0.9 years, between-group P > 0.05), duration of diabetes (pioglitazone: 4 [3–6] years; metformin: 3 [1–5] years, P > 0.05), and BMI (pioglitazone: 28.2 ± 0.5 kg/m²; metformin: 29.3 ± 0.6 kg/m², between-group P > 0.05).

- **Treatment effect**: The effects of treatment on hepatic triglyceride content and plasma lipid profiles are presented in Table 1. As previously shown, treatment with pioglitazone for 24 weeks decreased hepatic triglyceride content (5.9 [2.6–17.4] vs. 4.1 [1.9–12.3]%, P < 0.05). This was accompanied by a decrease in plasma CETP mass (2.33 ± 0.10 vs. 2.06 ± 0.10 μg/ml, P < 0.05) and an increase in plasma total cholesterol (4.90 ± 0.16 vs. 5.19 ± 0.22 mmol/l, P < 0.05), partly explained by an increase in HDL cholesterol levels (1.22 ± 0.05 vs. 1.34 ± 0.05 mmol/l, P < 0.05). Treatment with metformin did not significantly affect these parameters. Treatment with both pioglitazone and metformin decreased plasma triglycerides and apoB100 significantly; however, there was no difference in the reduction between the groups.

- **Table 1: Hepatic triglyceride content, plasma CETP mass, cholesterol, triglycerides, and apoB100 at baseline and after 24 weeks of treatment**

- **Correlations**: Changes in plasma CETP mass after 24 weeks in the pioglitazone-treated patients correlated with changes in hepatic triglyceride content (r = 0.34, P < 0.05), although this association was not present in the metformin group.
