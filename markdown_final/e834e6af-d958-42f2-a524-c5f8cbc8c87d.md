## Question

Treatment of ltbi in 5 year old healthy child

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diagnosing and treating latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in a healthy 5-year-old child. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the indication to test for LTBI in a 5-year-old. Then, I should verify the optimal diagnostic test and why. Next, I will review how to exclude active TB before treatment. After that, I need to select the preferred treatment regimen and dosing, including alternatives if needed. Finally, I should plan monitoring, address special scenarios like drug resistance or HIV, and ensure adherence strategies are in place.

> Let me first confirm the indication to test a healthy 5-year-old for LTBI, because guidelines emphasize risk-based testing rather than universal screening in low-risk populations. I should verify that the child has identifiable risk factors such as close contact with an infectious TB case, birth or prolonged travel in a high-burden country, or residence in a congregate setting before proceeding with testing [^11183sTw] [^113ioDhB] [^116uEdHZ].

> Wait, let me verify the best diagnostic test for a 5-year-old. I initially thought a tuberculin skin test (TST) might be preferred in all children under 5, but hold on, I should double-check the age threshold. The ATS/IDSA/CDC 2017 guidelines suggest TST over IGRA in healthy children under 5 years, whereas for children 5 years and older, IGRA is preferred when available, especially with BCG vaccination or poor return likelihood, so for a 5-year-old, IGRA is reasonable and often preferred if accessible and acceptable [^112S3xb9] [^113jBHMn] [^114NykMY].

> I need to ensure we exclude active TB before starting LTBI therapy. Let me first confirm the screening steps: ask about cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue, then obtain a chest radiograph, and if there are any radiographic abnormalities or symptoms, pursue sputum evaluation or alternative sampling depending on the child's ability to expectorate, because neither TST nor IGRA can distinguish latent from active disease [^11183sTw] [^112eoZqu].

> Next, I should review treatment options and choose the preferred regimen. The 2020 CDC/NTCA guidelines prioritize shorter rifamycin-based regimens due to comparable efficacy, better tolerability, and higher completion, so for a healthy 5-year-old, 4 months of daily rifampin is a strong preferred option, with 3 months of once-weekly isoniazid plus rifapentine (3HP) as another preferred choice if the child is at least 2 years old and DOT or reliable SAT can be arranged [^114FQHQk] [^111xc8Hc] [^117HxFFP].

> Let me think about dosing and administration. For rifampin 4 months, the pediatric dose is 15–20 mg/kg once daily, not to exceed 600 mg, and for 3HP, isoniazid is dosed at approximately 25 mg/kg per dose and rifapentine at weight-based fixed doses with supervision given the weekly schedule. I should confirm that the child's weight is measured accurately and that caregivers understand administration and adherence expectations [^111KhU4Q].

> Hold on, I should verify alternatives in case rifamycins are contraindicated or unavailable. 3 months of daily isoniazid plus rifampin is an acceptable preferred regimen, and 6 or 9 months of daily isoniazid remain alternative options, though longer courses have lower completion and higher hepatotoxicity risk. I need to weigh these trade-offs with the family and consider adherence supports if a longer isoniazid course is chosen [^114FQHQk] [^112Rzqnw] [^116JF88t].

> I will now examine safety and monitoring. Baseline and periodic clinical monitoring for symptoms and signs of hepatotoxicity is prudent, and although routine laboratory monitoring is not universally required in healthy children, I should confirm no underlying liver disease or interacting medications and counsel caregivers to report jaundice, dark urine, abdominal pain, or fatigue promptly. Rifampin tends to have less hepatotoxicity than isoniazid in pediatric cohorts, which supports its preference in many children [^117Tk4rh] [^114Pmvkv].

> But wait, what if the source case has drug-resistant TB? I should confirm that for isoniazid mono-resistance, 4 months of rifampin is appropriate, whereas for MDR or XDR exposures, expert consultation is essential and regimens may involve fluoroquinolones or other agents tailored to the source strain's susceptibilities, so I must not jump to conclusions and should involve pediatric TB expertise early in such scenarios [^115o1p73] [^114kr6AL].

> I need to ensure adherence and completion strategies are in place. Shorter rifamycin regimens markedly improve completion, and real-world pediatric data show higher completion with 4 months of rifampin versus 9 months of isoniazid. If using 3HP, I should discuss DOT versus carefully supervised SAT, as expert guidance allows SAT in children aged 2 years and older when adherence can be assured, balancing programmatic resources and risk [^112eBq5C] [^1146XXYm] [^117HxFFP].

> Let me reconsider the overall flow to ensure nothing is missing: confirm risk and indication to test, select IGRA for this 5-year-old when feasible, exclude active TB with symptom review and chest radiograph, choose a preferred rifamycin-based regimen such as 4 months of daily rifampin or 3HP if age-eligible, provide weight-based dosing and adherence support, monitor clinically for adverse effects, and adjust for drug resistance or comorbidities as needed. This sequence aligns with contemporary U.S. guidance and pediatric evidence [^11183sTw] [^114FQHQk].

---

For a healthy 5-year-old with LTBI, **preferred regimens** are 4 months of daily rifampin [^117Tk4rh] or 3 months of once-weekly isoniazid plus rifapentine (3HP) [^117HxFFP] [^114FQHQk], as they are effective, shorter, and have better completion rates than 9 months of isoniazid [^111xc8Hc]. Isoniazid for 6 or 9 months remains an alternative if rifamycins are unsuitable [^116JF88t]. Before treatment, **exclude active TB** with symptom screening and a chest radiograph [^11183sTw]; monitor for adverse effects and ensure adherence to prevent progression [^11785aap] [^115dezHu].

---

## Recommended treatment regimens

The CDC and NTCA recommend the following regimens for LTBI in children, including 5-year-olds:

| **Regimen** | **Duration** | **Dosing** | **Recommendation level** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Rifampin | 4 months | Daily | Strongly recommended |
| Isoniazid + rifapentine (3HP) | 3 months | Once weekly | Strongly recommended (≥ 2 years) |
| Isoniazid | 6 months | Daily | Alternative |
| Isoniazid | 9 months | Daily | Alternative |

---

Rifampin for 4 months is **strongly recommended** for its effectiveness, safety, and high completion rates [^112eBq5C]; the 3HP regimen is also strongly recommended for children aged ≥ 2 years, with high completion and favorable safety [^117HxFFP] [^114phH6f]. Isoniazid for 6 or 9 months remains effective but has lower completion and higher hepatotoxicity risk [^112Rzqnw].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting recommended regimens

- **Rifampin (4 months)**: Noninferior to 9 months of isoniazid, with lower hepatotoxicity and higher completion rates in children [^112eBq5C].
- **3HP (12 weekly doses)**: Noninferior to 9 months of isoniazid, with higher completion and fewer liver-related adverse events [^117HxFFP] [^114phH6f].
- **Isoniazid (6 or 9 months)**: Effective but longer, with lower completion and higher hepatotoxicity risk [^112Rzqnw].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Baseline assessment**: Symptom screening and chest radiograph to exclude active TB before starting LTBI therapy [^11183sTw].
- **Adverse effects monitoring**: Watch for hepatotoxicity, gastrointestinal upset, and hypersensitivity; routine lab monitoring is not required in healthy children but may be considered if risk factors are present.
- **Adherence**: Shorter regimens (rifampin 4 months, 3HP) improve completion and effectiveness [^112eBq5C] [^111xc8Hc].

---

## Parental counseling and education

Parents should be counseled on the **importance of adherence** to prevent progression to active TB [^115dezHu], the **potential adverse effects** of LTBI regimens and when to seek medical attention, and the **benefits of shorter regimens**, including improved adherence and fewer side effects [^112eBq5C].

---

## Special considerations

Drug interactions with rifamycins (e.g. antiretrovirals, anticonvulsants) may necessitate regimen adjustments or expert consultation [^117Tk4rh]. If drug resistance is suspected, tailor therapy to the **source case's susceptibility** and consult a pediatric TB specialist [^115o1p73].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Preferred regimens**: Rifampin for 4 months or 3HP for 3 months.
- **Alternative regimen**: Isoniazid for 6 or 9 months.
- **Exclude active TB**: Before starting LTBI therapy [^11183sTw].
- **Monitor**: For adverse effects and ensure adherence [^11785aap].

---

For a healthy 5-year-old with LTBI, **short-course rifamycin-based regimens** (rifampin 4 months or 3HP) are preferred for their effectiveness, safety, and higher completion rates; isoniazid remains an alternative if rifamycins are not suitable [^111xc8Hc].

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) screening and treatment in children — risk-based testing and DOT: The optimal approach is to perform tuberculin skin testing only on those children with specific risk factors for LTBI, using a questionnaire as the screening tool; only those children whose answers indicate that they are at risk for LTBI should receive a tuberculin skin test. Risk factors that have correlated highly with LTBI include previous positive tuberculin skin test result, birth in a foreign country with high prevalence, nontourist travel to a high-prevalence country for more than 1 week, contact with a person with TB, and presence in the household of another person with LTBI. For LTBI treatment among children, directly observed therapy (DOT) is recommended, and children most likely to benefit include contacts of persons with recently diagnosed pulmonary TB, infants and young children, and children with immunologic deficiencies, especially HIV infection.

### Priorities for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection in the United States [^112JmAJg]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). Excellent credibility.

Background

The prevention of active tuberculosis through the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection is a major element of the national strategy for eliminating tuberculosis in the United States. Targeted treatment for persons who are at the highest risk for reactivation tuberculosis will be needed to achieve this goal. A more precise assessment of the lifetime risk of reactivation tuberculosis, usually estimated at 5 to 10 percent, could help to identify patients who are at the highest risk and motivate them to complete treatment. Currently, the rate of completion of treatment is low.

Methods

Published reports were reviewed to obtain estimates of the risk of tuberculosis among persons with a positive tuberculin skin test. Using these data, I constructed a model to estimate the lifetime risk of tuberculosis among persons with specific medical conditions.

Results

The lifetime risk of reactivation tuberculosis is 20 percent or more among most persons with induration of 10 mm or more on a tuberculin skin test and either human immunodeficiency virus infection or evidence of old, healed tuberculosis. The lifetime risk is 10 to 20 percent among persons with recent conversion of a tuberculin skin test and among most persons younger than 35 years of age who are receiving infliximab therapy and have induration of 15 mm or more on a tuberculin skin test. The risk is also 10 to 20 percent among children five years of age or younger who have induration of 10 mm or more on a tuberculin skin test.

Conclusions

Persons with these characteristics should be targeted for intensive efforts to ensure full treatment of latent tuberculosis. Improved rates of completion of treatment among such persons could help to eliminate tuberculosis in the United States.

Benefits and harms of LTBI detection and treatment — randomized trial evidence — indicate that no trials directly compared screened vs unscreened populations; in the International Union Against Tuberculosis (IUAT) trial of isoniazid vs placebo, isoniazid treatment (300 mg/d for 24 weeks) decreased active tuberculosis risk (RR, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.24–0.52]), translating to a number needed to treat of 112, and suggested a potential reduction in risk of death from tuberculosis at 5 years (RR, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.01–2.81]). More recent comparative effectiveness trials evaluated noninferiority of regimens vs isoniazid alone, and two trials (n = 7149) of rifapentine plus isoniazid vs isoniazid alone reported 30 vs 84 deaths across both studies, with one trial (n = 6886) reporting 5 vs 10 subsequent active tuberculosis cases; none of the treatment studies reported transmission outcomes. Harms reporting found no studies on screening harms, while the IUAT trial showed increased risk of hepatotoxicity with isoniazid (RR, 4.59 [95% CI, 2.03–10.39]), corresponding to a number needed to harm of 279.

Diagnostic approach for suspected LTBI — test sensitivity in low/intermediate-risk individuals 5 years or older — indicates that in persons likely infected with Mtb but at low or intermediate risk of disease progression, IGRA sensitivity has been consistently reported as either equal (QFT; 81%–86%) or superior (T-SPOT; 90%–95%) to the sensitivity of the tuberculin skin test (TST; 71%–82%).

### Screening for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117PdHD8]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Tuberculosis remains an important preventable disease in the United States. An effective strategy for reducing the transmission, morbidity, and mortality of active disease is the identification and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) to prevent progression to active disease.

Objective

To issue a current US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for LTBI.

Evidence Review

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for LTBI in asymptomatic adults seen in primary care, including evidence dating from the inception of searched databases.

Findings

The USPSTF found adequate evidence that accurate screening tests for LTBI are available, treatment of LTBI provides a moderate health benefit in preventing progression to active disease, and the harms of screening and treatment are small. The USPSTF has moderate certainty that screening for LTBI in persons at increased risk for infection provides a moderate net benefit.

Conclusions and Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends screening for LTBI in populations at increased risk. (B recommendation).

### Guidelines for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2020 [^113X3BwC]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

For patients without drug intolerability or drug-drug interactions, short-course (3–4 months) rifamycin-based treatment regimens are preferred over the longer-course (6–9 months) isoniazid monotherapy for treatment of LTBI. These guidelines can be used by clinicians, public health officials, policymakers, health care organizations, and other state and local stakeholders who might need to adapt these guidelines for individual clinical circumstances. Local and state TB programs in the United States answer questions about diagnosing and treating persons with LTBI in their jurisdictions.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) diagnostic testing — IGRA vs TST and age thresholds: Guidelines recommend that persons at low risk for Mtb infection and disease progression NOT be tested for Mtb infection. We concur with this recommendation. If diagnostic testing is nevertheless performed in such individuals, We suggest performing an IGRA instead of a TST in individuals 5 years or older (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). We suggest a second diagnostic test if the initial test is positive in individuals 5 years or older (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). When such testing is performed, the person is considered infected only if both tests are positive. We suggest performing a TST rather than an IGRA in healthy children < 5 years of age for whom it has been decided that diagnostic testing for LTBI is warranted (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). In situations in which an IGRA is deemed the preferred diagnostic test, some experts are willing to use IGRAs in children over 3 years of age. While both IGRA and TST testing provide evidence for infection with Mtb, they cannot distinguish active from latent TB. Therefore, the diagnosis of active TB must be excluded prior to starting on treatment for LTBI. This is typically done by determining whether or not symptoms suggestive of TB disease are present, performing a chest radiograph and, if radiographic signs of active TB are seen, then sampling is performed and the patient managed accordingly.

### Screening for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117V6iDj]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Definitions of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and active tuberculosis: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), latent tuberculosis infection or LTBI is an infection with M tuberculosis in which the bacteria are alive but contained by the immune system, persons with LTBI have no apparent symptoms, do not feel sick, cannot spread tuberculosis to others, and usually have a positive tuberculin skin test result or positive tuberculosis blood test reaction, and persons with LTBI may develop tuberculosis disease if they do not receive treatment for LTBI. Active tuberculosis or tuberculosis disease is an illness in which tuberculosis bacteria are multiplying and attacking a part of the body, usually the lungs; tuberculosis disease may be symptomatic (including weakness, weight loss, fever, no appetite, chills, sweating at night, bad cough, pain in the chest, or coughing up blood), and a person with tuberculosis disease may be infectious and spread tuberculosis bacteria to others.

Among HIV-positive persons living in areas with a high TB incidence, isoniazid is complementary to antiretroviral therapy in preventing TB disease. Two randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that isoniazid plus antiretroviral therapy decreased the incidence of TB disease to a greater extent than either isoniazid alone or antiretroviral therapy alone. Potential disadvantages of the regimen include its long duration, hepatoxicity, and low treatment completion rates (primarily due to the first two factors).

### Screening for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113imv8J]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

In the US, tuberculosis remains an important preventable disease, including active tuberculosis, which may be infectious, and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), which is asymptomatic and not infectious but can later progress to active disease. The precise prevalence rate of LTBI in the US is difficult to determine; however, estimated prevalence is about 5.0%, or up to 13 million persons. Incidence of tuberculosis varies by geography and living accommodations, suggesting an association with social determinants of health.

Objective

To update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on LTBI screening and treatment in asymptomatic adults seen in primary care, as well as the accuracy of LTBI screening tests.

Population

Asymptomatic adults 18 years or older at increased risk for tuberculosis.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit in preventing active tuberculosis disease by screening for LTBI in persons at increased risk for tuberculosis infection.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends screening for LTBI in populations at increased risk. (B recommendation).

Mycobacterium tuberculosis — detection of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in children: Diagnostic methods include the tuberculin skin test (TST) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved interferon gamma release assays (IGRA), but TST is preferred over IGRA in children aged < 5 years (BIII). TST and IGRA should NOT be used to rule out disease and cannot replace regular screening for TB exposure (AII), and in high TB-burden settings screening for TB exposure and for signs or symptoms suggestive of TB disease should occur at every health care visit (AIII).

### A scoping review of paediatric latent tuberculosis infection care cascades: initial steps are lacking [^117VkLtW]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Background

The WHO has named identification and treatment of tuberculosis (TB) infection a cornerstone of efforts to eliminate TB by 2030.(note: in this article, we will use the term 'TB infection' to distinguish patients with latent TB infection from those with TB disease.) The United Nations has set shorter term milestones to end the TB epidemic, including provision of TB preventive treatment (TPT) for 30 million people exposed to infectious TB and/or diagnosed with TB infection between 2018 and 2022, of whom 6.3 million received treatment in 2018–2019.TB infection diagnosis and treatment require completion of sequential steps, which together constitute the TB infection care cascade.

A prior systematic review and meta-analysis found that more than 80% of adults and children at risk for TB infection do not complete the care cascade. Several studies have found that children face different barriers and complete one or more cascade steps at different rates than adults. Yet two prior systematic reviews of the TB infection care cascade have either excluded children or did not distinguish the unique challenges paediatric patients face. The full TB infection cascade is not always needed — existing guidance recommends that child contacts < 5 years old and people living with HIV exposed to infectious TB can be started on TPT following a clinical exam without preceding TB infection testing. A focused systematic review of contact case management of child contacts of individuals with infectious TB in high burden countries identified health system (eg, lack of protocols and lack of healthcare worker (HCW) education), structural (eg, cost of transport) and patient/family level barriers to completing evaluation for TB and initiation/completion of TPT. Because of heterogeneity in TB screening guidelines between countries, and because testing is not always needed for contact case management in high burden countries, that review did not examine gaps in TB infection diagnosis in detail. However, even in high TB burden settings, strengthening testing pathways will help to avoid unnecessary TPT, improve acceptability of treatment and expand treatment beyond close contacts.

### Prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection among healthy young children and adolescents and a two-step approach for the diagnosis of tuberculosis infection in chengdu, China [^112CWmjH]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The incubation period of TB is typically several months to 2 years. A 5-year follow-up study in China revealed that disease progression in the first 2 years was higher than in the latter 3, which was consistent with the report of WHOand Behr et al. Treatment of LTBI reduces the risk of disease progression, which is especially critical for young children. However, the absence of standard guidelines makes implementation difficult. Six preschool children in our study have been started on a prophylactic 3-month regimen of isoniazid and rifampicin, and the follow-up is ongoing to record any adverse events.

There are several limitations of this study that must be considered. TST results are affected by a complex array of factors, including BCG vaccination, and may result in an overestimation of LTBI prevalence in a high BCG vaccination setting. The BCG vaccination data of most young children and adolescents included in the study was not available and we assumed that all participants were successfully vaccinated based on the BCG vaccination rate of 2520 preschool children (99.17%). However, the only gold standard that may be valid for the detection of LTBI is the possibility of developing active TB at a later stage, which can be confirmed through longitudinal monitoring of individuals considered to be at risk. Therefore, it hints us that all participants diagnosed with LTBI showed be followed up in the future to confirm a true-positive or false-positive TST. Furthermore, 341 preschool children did not receive both tests on the same day or TST followed by IGRA within 3 days, but a positive diagnosis of LTBI was still observed. This was inconsistent with the guidelines in some countries, which claim that TST can subsequently boost IGRA results. However, there is limited evidence to support this claim. Therefore, studies that can confirm and analyze this paradox in Chinese populations with different genetic backgrounds are needed.

### Initiation and completion of treatment for latent tuberculosis infection in migrants globally: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Y6QNV]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 25% of the global population have latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), and approximately 5–15% of those infected will develop active tuberculosis in their lifetime. Among contacts of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, the 5-year cumulative risk of LTBI infection is approximately 10%, although this risk appears to be much greater in younger individuals, in whom the 5-year risk was 33.3% in contacts younger than 5 years, and 19.1% in those aged 5–14 years. Delivering effective LTBI screening and treatment programmes is increasingly emphasised in the control of tuberculosis, with WHO's End TB strategy outlining expanded preventive treatment of people at higher risk of tuberculosis, and encouraging research to improve LTBI detection and treatment. The first UN high-level meeting on tuberculosis in 2018 set a target to reach 30 million people with preventive treatment for tuberculosis between 2018 and 2022, including 20 million household contacts, and 4 million children younger than 5 years.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Reactivation of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is a major driver of tuberculosis incidence worldwide; in countries with a low incidence of tuberculosis, LTBI is disproportionately concentrated among migrants, with national programmes increasingly focusing on the diagnosis and treatment of LTBI in migrants and other high-risk groups. However, little is known about the success of these programmes in engaging migrants and ensuring treatment completion because migrants often face multiple barriers to accessing health care on arrival in the host country. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Global Health from Jan 1, 2000, to April 21, 2020 for publications on LTBI treatment initiation and completion in migrants. Before this study we found two reviews on this topic (Sandgren and colleagues, 2016, and Alsdurf and colleagues, 2016); however, neither specifically focused on migrants. Sandgren and colleagues included a small number of studies reporting on migrant outcomes and did not have a formal meta-analysis, and Alsdurf and colleagues used data before 2000 that might not be relevant to current policy. Other studies have reported on migrant-specific outcomes in LTBI programmes globally, but the focus is often on screening practices rather than outcomes and evidence in this area has not yet been effectively consolidated.

### Official American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America / centers for disease control and prevention clinical practice guidelines: diagnosis of tuberculosis in adults and children [^1177QJon]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) may develop symptoms and signs of disease (tuberculosis disease) or may have no clinical evidence of disease (latent tuberculosis infection [LTBI]). Tuberculosis disease is a leading cause of infectious disease morbidity and mortality worldwide, yet many questions related to its diagnosis remain.

Methods

A task force supported by the American Thoracic Society, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Infectious Diseases Society of America searched, selected, and synthesized relevant evidence. The evidence was then used as the basis for recommendations about the diagnosis of tuberculosis disease and LTBI in adults and children. The recommendations were formulated, written, and graded using the Grading, Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Results

Twenty-three evidence-based recommendations about diagnostic testing for latent tuberculosis infection, pulmonary tuberculosis, and extrapulmonary tuberculosis are provided. Six of the recommendations are strong, whereas the remaining 17 are conditional.

Conclusions

These guidelines are not intended to impose a standard of care. They provide the basis for rational decisions in the diagnosis of tuberculosis in the context of the existing evidence. No guidelines can take into account all of the often compelling unique individual clinical circumstances.

Latent tuberculosis infection — risk stratification and prognostic test performance are described as follows: Individuals with immunological evidence of exposure to Mtb antigens but without clinical disease are termed latently infected, and those with recent infection (< 2 years) are at increased risk for progression to clinical disease. Those with negative TSTs or IGRAs are unlikely to progress to TB, yet the PPV of either test is relatively modest, with household-contact estimates that 20–200 people require treatment to prevent one case. Evidence for IGRAs in children < 5 years old is still limited, and studies to inform appropriate use for accurately diagnosing LTBI in this age group are needed.

### Guidelines for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2020 [^111Q3gwt]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

One fourth of the global population (approximately 2 billion persons) is estimated to be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, including approximately 13 million in the United States. Most infected persons are asymptomatic and classified as having latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). If untreated, approximately 5%–10% of persons with LTBI progress to tuberculosis (TB) disease during their lifetime. Progression from untreated LTBI accounts for approximately 80% of U.S. TB disease cases. Treatment of LTBI is effective in preventing progression to TB disease. The most recent comprehensive guidelines for treatment of LTBI in the United States were published in 2000. In 2003, CDC and the American Thoracic Society recommended against use of the 2-month regimen of rifampin plus pyrazinamide because of the risk for severe hepatotoxicity. Since then, several new regimens have been evaluated in clinical trials. To update the 2000 and 2003 treatment guidelines, the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association (NTCA) and CDC convened a committee to conduct a systematic literature review of clinical trials for the treatment of LTBI. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria were applied to the evidence of effectiveness, a network meta-analysis of selected evidence was performed, and the evidence was used to support 2020 LTBI treatment guidelines.

These updated 2020 LTBI treatment guidelines apply to persons with LTBI who live in the United States. In addition, these guidelines apply to persons infected with M. tuberculosis that is presumed to be susceptible to isoniazid or rifampin; they do not apply when evidence is available that the infecting M. tuberculosis strain is resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin.

### Better completion of pediatric latent tuberculosis treatment using 4 months of rifampin in a US-based tuberculosis clinic [^1146XXYm]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Children less than 5 years of age have the highest age-specific rate of progression from latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) to active disease. Therefore, regimens for treatment of pediatric LTBI must be not only efficacious but practical enough to overcome the unique childhood barriers to regimen adherence. Since 2012, a 4-month regimen of daily rifampin (4R) has been the standard recommendation for pediatric LTBI at the Denver Metro Tuberculosis Clinic.

Methods

Using univariate and multivariate analyses, we compared treatment completion rates between 4R and 9-month isoniazid (9H) regimens for all pediatric patients treated for LTBI at the Denver Metro Tuberculosis Clinic between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2015, and assessed the influence of clinical and demographic characteristics on successful completion of the 2 regimens.

Results

There were 395 children in the 4R cohort and 779 in the 9H cohort. Completion rates overall were significantly higher for 4R than 9H (83.5% vs. 68.8%, P < 0.001). Drug toxicity leading to treatment noncompletion was low in both groups (1.5% in 4R and 0.7% in 9H, P = 0.23), and no patient progressed to active tuberculosis in either cohort. The 9H cohort was more likely to fail treatment completion because of barriers potentially related to the longer duration of treatment such as relocation or loss to follow-up.

Conclusions

Pediatric patients were significantly more likely to complete LTBI treatment using a 4R than with a 9-month isoniazid regimen. Better completion rates of 4R may increase efficacy of tuberculosis prevention and decrease demand on public health resources.

### Consensus statement on research definitions for drug-resistant tuberculosis in children [^114X4bZv]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2013). Low credibility.

Terms used for the treatment given to those with TB disease include "curative treatment", "disease treatment", "anti-TB treatment", and "TB treatment". To avoid ambiguity, we suggest using the term "TB treatment". In the existing literature, there is also inconsistency surrounding the terminology used to describe other forms of chemotherapy. Pre-exposure prophylaxis refers to treatment given to a child without known exposure to an infectious TB case. Postexposure (including window) prophylaxis refers to treatment given to a child after documented TB exposure. Treatment of latent TB infection refers to drugs given after a positive immunological test result indicating previous or current M tuberculosis infection. Posttreatment prophylaxis refers to treatment given to a child after a course of TB treatment. For consistency, we suggest the use of the summative term "TB preventive therapy" to cover all of these circumstances.

ATS/CDC/IDSA — pediatric TB contacts and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) management: Children younger than 5 years who are contacts of persons with infectious tuberculosis (TB) should receive a medical evaluation including a tuberculin skin test and chest radiograph, and after active TB is ruled out, children with positive tuberculin skin tests should receive a full course of LTBI treatment while those with negative tests should also receive treatment for presumed LTBI; this is especially critical for infants and toddlers younger than 3 years but is recommended for all children younger than 5 years. A second tuberculin test should be placed at least 3 months after exposure has ended, and if the second test is positive treatment should be continued for a full LTBI course, whereas if negative treatment may be stopped (AII).

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^117MbDha]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric HIV — preferred latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) regimens include 3HP and rifampin- or isoniazid-containing options. In adults and children 2 years and older, including those with HIV, a 12-dose once-weekly isoniazid plus rifapentine (3HP) regimen is as safe and effective as 9 months of isoniazid, with high completion whether directly observed therapy (DOT) or self-administered therapy, and 3HP can be used in adults and children ≥ 2 years old with HIV who are receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), with acceptable drug–drug interactions with rifapentine (strong, moderate). The preferred regimens for presumed drug-susceptible LTBI include twelve weeks of weekly isoniazid and rifapentine for children and adolescents > 2 years old, four months of daily rifampin for children of all ages, and three months of daily isoniazid and rifampin for children of all ages.

### Prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection among healthy young children and adolescents and a two-step approach for the diagnosis of tuberculosis infection in chengdu, China [^11169kvN]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The guidelines for the use of TST and/or IGRA as a screening tool for young children are controversial, and there is limited evidence regarding the optimal diagnostic approach for LTBI. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations in 2018 recommended IGRA as the preferred test for LTBI among BCG-vaccinated children 2 years and older, and equally acceptable as TST in non-BCG-vaccinated children. Studies included children with different population features also support the use of IGRAs for children. – On the contrary, the Canadian Thoracic Society suspected that IGRA performed worse in young children than in adults. However, studies of meta-analysis confirmed that IGRA was more specific in low-risk, BCG-vaccinated individuals. As a consequence, a 2-step approach (TST-IGRA) has been followed in many countries in terms of cost-effectiveness and diagnostic accuracy, but the TST cutoff value and target group population in the guidelines varies in different countries. As a high TB burden country, it is also not feasible to screen tuberculosis infection using both methods simultaneously in China instantly. The latest expert consensus on LTBI screening and preventive treatment for children in China in 2020 supports using IGRA and TST for diagnosing LTBI, with IGRA given preference in economically developed areas. The 2-step approach for LTBI screening to improve diagnostic accuracy was also recommended in Chinese students recently, although the accurate TST cutoff value was not well-defined. Furthermore, an earlier study conducted in China found that the 2-step approach was suitable for adolescents. In the context, we used TST ≥ 5 mm as the cutoff value, and 341 preschool children with TST ≥ 5 mm underwent T-SPOT. Four children younger than 5 years of age were T-SPOT positive with TST induration 5–10 mm, and did not exhibit any clinical symptoms of TB nor had any history of close contact with TB patients. Thus, TST ≥ 5 mm is an indication for a IGRA confirmation test, which can detect TB infection early and reduce the cost of subsequent examinations. Similarly, Gao et alfound that 9 of 406 school children 5–15 years of age with TST induration 5–15 mm were also T-SPOT positive, indicating that the 5-mm threshold was also suitable for older children. Therefore, more studies are needed to validate the TST positive threshold for children in the 2-step approach to develop an optimal testing strategy for Chinese children of different age groups, the implementation of this 2-step approach will significantly reduce the incidence of false positives and the burden of preventive treatment measures.

### Effectiveness and safety of available preventive tuberculosis treatment regimens for children and adolescents: protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115BoRWy]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 5%-10% of individuals with untreated latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) will progress to active tuberculosis (TB). Children are at a higher risk for progression to TB disease than adults. Isoniazid prophylaxis treatment period is long and can cause liver damage. Alternatives to isoniazid, such as rifamycin containing regimens, should be considered for prophylaxis. Previous systematic reviews, with different study designs and data combining results on children and adults, have evaluated the comparative efficacy and harms of LTBI treatment regimens. We aim to determine the effectiveness and safety of all the different regimens available for the treatment of LTBI for children and adolescents less than 18 years of age, contacts of drug-susceptible TB, without HIV infection.

Methods and Analysis

MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be systematically searched for randomised controlled trials without any language or publication date restriction. Screening and extraction will be performed in duplicate. Risk of bias will be performed in duplicate with Cochrane Risk of Bias tool V.2. Pairwise meta-analysis of direct comparisons and network meta-analyses (NMAs) will be performed. Heterogeneity will be assessed using I² and Cochrane thresholds. Direct and indirect estimates in an NMA will be combined if justifiable. Subgroups analyses will be performed in different mean age and study year groups. Sensitivity analysis based on the risk of bias will be conducted. Publication bias will be investigated using funnel plots and Egger's regression test. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria will assess certainty of the evidence for the direct comparisons. GRADE approach for NMA will assess the quality of the evidence from the indirect and NMA.

Ethics and Dissemination

Ethical approval is not required as no primary data are collected. This systematic review will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal.

### Implementation of an integrated care strategy for child contacts of tuberculosis patients: a quasi-experimental study protocol [^1141oskn]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Tuberculosis (TB) in childhood is considered a public health emergency, particularly in developing countries, where it accounts for approximately 15% of TB cases. This form of the disease remains relatively ignored, mainly because of the major diagnostic challenges and low priority given by TB control programs. In 2012 the WHO began to publish data on the incidence of TB in children under 15 years of age separated from adults, showing the need to give more importance to childhood TB.

Compared to adults, children respond differently to the disease. This has important implications for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. In addition, children living in close contact with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB patients are at particular risk of infection (50%) and TB disease (8.5%), and progression from primary M. tuberculosis infection to disease, especially infants and children under five years of age. This makes them a target group for the treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI). Likewise, much of the postprimary TB is due to cases of reactivation of childhood-acquired infections. However, children who are household contacts of pulmonary TB patients do not receive proper care in the national TB control programs. In 2020, the WHO reported that in Colombia, 38% of children under five years who were in household contact with bacteriologically confirmed TB patients were on treatment for LTBI.

The WHO recognizes the importance of identifying the best strategies to trace contacts, especially in children, and researching the best-tolerated TB preventive treatment regimens compared to those currently recommended. This highlights the need for studies on the identification of strategies to improve adherence to TB preventive treatment in children, the reporting and management of child contacts, identification of barriers reports including the private sector, access to health services and integrated services, and implementation/operational research on the use and impact of the newly developed integrated treatment decision algorithms.

The best-studied regimen for LTBI treatment is isoniazid 10 mg/kg per day, not exceeding 300 mg per day, in single doses for 12 months. This regimen is almost 100% effective in children and protects them for at least 30 years. Most authorities recommend at least nine months of preventive treatment in children, but at least six months of continuous medication appears to be necessary to achieve a significant reduction in the risk of developing TB.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) screening applies to asymptomatic adults 18 years or older at increased risk for tuberculosis. The USPSTF recommends screening for LTBI in populations at increased risk. (B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit in preventing active tuberculosis disease by screening for LTBI in persons at increased risk for tuberculosis infection. To achieve the benefit of screening, it is important that persons who screen positive for LTBI receive follow-up and treatment. Estimated prevalence is about 5.0%, or up to 13 million persons.

### Guidelines for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2020 [^117Tk4rh]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Four Months of Daily Rifampin

A regimen of 4 months of daily rifampin is a preferred treatment that is strongly recommended for HIV-negative adults and children of all ages. (No evidence is available for effectiveness in HIV-positive persons.) The effectiveness of this regimen was clinically equivalent to, and less toxic than, the standard regimen of 9 months of daily isoniazid in adults and children. Four months of daily rifampin had noninferior effectiveness in preventing TB disease compared with 9 months of daily isoniazid, as well as a lower rate of treatment discontinuation because of adverse effects, a lower rate of hepatotoxicity, and a higher rate of treatment completion.

The potential disadvantages of the rifamycin-based regimens are the many drug interactions, including warfarin, oral contraceptives, azole antifungals, and HIV antiretroviral therapy. Rifabutin has fewer or less pronounced drug interactions and may be used in place of rifampin when rifampin is contraindicated due to drug-drug interactions and isoniazid cannot be used. Drug interactions with weekly rifapentine are fewer than with rifampin and appear to be fewer than with rifabutin; therefore, weekly isoniazid and rifapentine could be considered when rifampin is contraindicated, although clinical data are limited. Drug-drug interactions between rifamycins and antiretroviral therapy are regularly updated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In HIV-positive persons with low CD4+ lymphocyte counts, the risk for asymptomatic or subclinical TB disease increases, possibly facilitating rifampin resistance if TB disease is inadvertently treated with rifampin monotherapy.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^111UPa3D]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Detection of latent TB infection (LTBI) in children with HIV — IGRA versus TST use: Among children < 15 years old with HIV, IGRAs and TSTs can be used to diagnose LTBI in children 5 years or older (strong, moderate), and when applicable, IGRAs are preferable for diagnosing LTBI in Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG)–vaccinated people and those who are unlikely to return for interpretation of TST results (strong, moderate). CDC guidelines currently recommend TSTs for diagnosing LTBI in children 2 to 5 years old, while some experts and the AAP Red Book recommend using IGRAs to diagnose LTBI in children ≥ 2 years old; however, younger age (< 5 years), HIV itself, and lower CD4 cell counts have been associated with indeterminate IGRA results (and false negative TST results). CDC guidelines and the AAP Red Book recommend TSTs for diagnosing LTBI in children < 2 years old (expert opinion). Diagnostic methods include the TST administered by the Mantoux method using 5 tuberculin units of an FDA-approved purified protein derivative, or an FDA-approved IGRA (QuantiFERON-TB Gold, QuantiFERON-Plus, and T-SPOT.TB).

Systematic Review

A CDC Work Group including epidemiologists, health scientists, physicians from CDC's Tuberculosis Elimination program, and a CDC library specialist, was convened to conduct the systematic literature review using methods adapted from the Guide to Community Preventive Services. The library specialist used a systematic search strategy to identify and retrieve intervention studies on the use of 3HP to treat LTBI that were published from January 2006 through June 2017 and indexed in the MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Clinicaltrials.gov databases. To identify missed studies, reference lists from included articles were reviewed, and CDC's TB experts were consulted. This review included English language articles that met the following criteria: 1) the study design was randomized controlled trial, quasi-experimental, observational cohort, or other design with a concurrent comparison group; 2) the target population included, but was not restricted to, persons aged ≥ 12 years, children aged 2–11 years, or persons with HIV infection; and 3) outcomes reported were prevention of TB disease, treatment completion, adverse events while on 3HP, discontinuation as a result of adverse events while on 3HP, or death while on 3HP.

Two reviewers from the CDC Work Group independently screened citations obtained from the search and retrieved full-text articles in the relevant literature to be synthesized. Using a standard data abstraction form, the reviewers abstracted data on intervention characteristics, outcomes of interest, demographics, benefits, harms, considerations for implementation, and evidence gaps. Each study was also assessed for threats to internal and external validity per Guide to Community Preventive Services standards. Any disagreement between reviewers was resolved by consensus of the CDC Work Group members.

The CDC Work Group reviewed 292 citations retrieved from the librarian's search. Of these, 30 full-text articles were ordered and screened for inclusion. No eligible studies including children aged < 2 years were identified. In total, 19 articles representing 15 unique studies were included in the meta-analysis. Findings from the meta-analysis indicated that 3HP is as safe and effective as other recommended LTBI regimens and achieves significantly higher treatment completion rates. Complete results of the systematic review and meta-analysis have been published elsewhere. Overall, the majority of included studies were of greatest design suitability and good quality of execution, as defined by the Guide to Community Preventive Services. Issues related to poor reporting of appropriate analytic methods and possible selection bias were the most common limitations assigned to the body of evidence.

### Initiation and completion of treatment for latent tuberculosis infection in migrants globally: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114xPjvC]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Implications of all the available evidence

Delivery of LTBI programmes will need to be strengthened to improve outcomes for migrants and meet targets to eradicate tuberculosis in low-incidence countries. Greater focus will need to be placed on engaging migrants more effectively in the clinic, understanding the varied reasons for migrants' declining treatment when testing positive, and ensuring treatment adherence using innovative approaches that are mindful of and sensitive to the unique experiences of this group on arrival to the host country.

In many high-income, low-incidence tuberculosis countries (< 10 cases per 100 000 population)migrants have a greater burden of tuberculosis, and tend to be younger, than native-born populations. For example, 77.3% of first-time asylum seekers in the 27 EU countries in 2019 were younger than 35 years.LTBI prevalence is probably higher in some migrant populations, with refugee children estimated to have LTBI prevalence rates of around 11%. High LTBI prevalence could drive greater active tuberculosis incidence within these populations, as most cases are likely to be due to re-activation of LTBI. One retrospective cohort of 142 314 people estimated a tuberculosis incidence rate of 120 cases per 100 000 person-years among migrants compared with an incidence rate of 4 cases per 100 000 person-years in native-born individuals. The incidence of tuberculosis among migrants is greatest within the first 5 years of arrival, driven by health-related factors (eg, age and comorbid status) and socioeconomic factors (eg, living conditions).WHO has published recommendations for low-incidence countries to consider systematic LTBI testing and treatment in migrants. Consequently, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has developed guidance for the programmatic management of LTBI in migrants (among other groups), in line with WHO recommendations.

### Guidelines for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2020 [^111xc8Hc]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary of Evidence and Recommendations

The recommended treatment regimens include three preferred and two alternative treatment regimens (Tables 3 and 4). Rifamycin-based regimens, including 3 months of once-weekly isoniazid plus rifapentine, 4 months of daily rifampin, and 3 months of daily isoniazid plus rifampin are the preferred recommended regimens because of their effectiveness, safety, and high treatment completion rates. Regimens of 6 or 9 months of daily isoniazid are alternative recommended regimens; although efficacious, they have higher toxicity risk and lower treatment completion rates, which decrease effectiveness. On the basis of the most recent comprehensive LTBI treatment guidelines in the United States, which were published in 2000, 9 months of daily isoniazid was considered the standard comparator regimen to evaluate shorter-course regimens. Data on the effectiveness and toxicity of 9 months of daily isoniazid are provided, as are data on the other recommended regimens. A rifamycin-based regimen refers to treatment that includes either rifampin or rifapentine.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) prevention in children with HIV after exposure to drug-resistant TB — after exposure to TB caused by isoniazid mono-resistant organisms, preventive therapy with 4 months of daily rifampin is recommended for children with HIV, and adjustment of antiretroviral therapy to consider drug–drug interactions between rifampin and ART might be necessary (expert opinion). After exposure to TB caused by organisms with other drug resistance patterns (e.g. MDR), expert consultation should be obtained to determine optimal LTBI treatment regimens, and drug susceptibility testing (DST) results for the TB index patient are important considerations (expert opinion). The optimal prophylaxis regimen for exposure to a person with MDR-TB or XDR-TB has not been defined; treatment should be tailored in consultation with an expert, rifampin would be the preferred agent if the source case was known to be resistant to isoniazid but susceptible to rifampin, and rifampin has drug–drug interactions with several antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV infection with possible need for dose adjustment.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) testing — two-step strategy considerations are described: Performing a second diagnostic test when the initial test is negative is a strategy to increase sensitivity. This may reduce specificity, but the panel decided that this is an acceptable trade-off in situations in which the consequences of missing LTBI (ie, not treating individuals who may benefit from therapy) exceed the consequences of inappropriate therapy (ie, hepatotoxicity). Performing a confirmatory test following an initial positive result is based upon both the evidence that false-positive results are common among individuals who are unlikely to be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the committee's presumption that performing a second test on those patients whose initial test was positive will help identify initial false-positive results.

### Prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection among healthy young children and adolescents and a two-step approach for the diagnosis of tuberculosis infection in chengdu, China [^116dBAxW]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background:

China has a high burden of tuberculosis and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of LTBI among healthy young children and adolescents and test a 2-step approach to explore the threshold for the diagnosis of tuberculosis infection in Chengdu, China.

Methods:

Healthy preschool children and school-going children in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, were screened for LTBI using the tuberculin skin test (TST). Preschool children with TST ≥ 5 mm also underwent interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) to explore the threshold of this 2-step approach.

Results:

In total, 5667 healthy young children and adolescents completed TST test between July 2020 and January 2021 and were included in the present analysis. The age of the participants ranged from 2.4 to 18 years (median 7.25 ± 4.514 years), of which 2093 (36.9%) were younger than 5 years. The overall prevalence of LTBI was 6.37% and 6.64% in children younger than 5 years old. Fourteen of the 341 preschool children with TST ≥ 5 mm were interferon-γ release assay positive, of which 4 showed a TST result of 5–10 mm, and 6 preschool children received preventive treatment for LTBI.

Conclusions:

Healthy young children and adolescents should also be considered as important target populations for LTBI screening. TST can be recommended for first-line screening as part of a 2-step approach for LTBI screening using a positive threshold of 5 mm.

### Update of recommendations for use of once-weekly isoniazid-rifapentine regimen to treat latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection [^114phH6f]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Recently published randomized control trials that were heavily weighted in the meta-analyses and drug interaction studies are summarized as follows:

Study of 3HP in children. A large randomized clinical trial of 3HP administered by DOT, which included children aged 2–17 years, demonstrated that 3HP was as well-tolerated and as effective as 9 months of daily isoniazid (9H) for preventing TB. The trial also reported that 3HP was safe and had higher treatment completion rates than 9H. Data on the safety and pharmacokinetics of rifapentine in children aged < 2 years are not available.

Studies of 3HP in persons with HIV infection, including AIDS. In 2011, CDC recommended the 3HP regimen for treatment of LTBI in persons with HIV infection, including AIDS, who are otherwise healthy and who are not taking antiretroviral medications. Since that time, additional data confirm not only the effectiveness of 3HP in persons with HIV infection who are not taking antiretroviral therapy, but also demonstrate the absence of clinically significant drug interactions between once-weekly rifapentine and either efavirenz or raltegravir in persons with HIV infection who are treated with those antiretroviral medications (,–).

Study of self-administered therapy. A randomized clinical trial demonstrating noninferior treatment completion and safety of 3HP-SAT compared with 3HP-DOT in persons aged ≥ 18 years in the United States provides the primary evidence on 3HP administration by SAT. The 3HP-SAT regimen has not been studied in randomized controlled trials in persons aged < 18 years.

Latent Mtb infection (LTBI) — natural history and risk of progression indicates that, in the absence of treatment, approximately 4%–6% of individuals who acquire LTBI will develop active tuberculosis during their lifetime, with the greatest risk of progression during the first 2 years following exposure; risk is increased among young (< 4 years) children and those receiving corticosteroids or tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors, and persons with latent infection who acquire HIV infection will develop TB disease at an approximate rate of 5%–10% per year when not receiving effective HIV treatment.

### Effectiveness and safety of available preventive tuberculosis treatment regimens for children and adolescents: protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116PAMXu]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 5%–10% of individuals with untreated latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) will progress to active tuberculosis (TB). Children are at a higher risk for progression to TB disease than adults. Isoniazid prophylaxis treatment period is long and can cause liver damage. Alternatives to isoniazid, such as rifamycin containing regimens, should be considered for prophylaxis. Previous systematic reviews, with different study designs and data combining results on children and adults, have evaluated the comparative efficacy and harms of LTBI treatment regimens. We aim to determine the effectiveness and safety of all the different regimens available for the treatment of LTBI for children and adolescents less than 18 years of age, contacts of drug-susceptible TB, without HIV infection.

Methods and analysis

MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be systematically searched for randomised controlled trials without any language or publication date restriction. Screening and extraction will be performed in duplicate. Risk of bias will be performed in duplicate with Cochrane Risk of Bias tool V.2. Pairwise meta-analysis of direct comparisons and network meta-analyses (NMAs) will be performed. Heterogeneity will be assessed using I² and Cochrane thresholds. Direct and indirect estimates in an NMA will be combined if justifiable. Subgroups analyses will be performed in different mean age and study year groups. Sensitivity analysis based on the risk of bias will be conducted. Publication bias will be investigated using funnel plots and Egger's regression test. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria will assess certainty of the evidence for the direct comparisons. GRADE approach for NMA will assess the quality of the evidence from the indirect and NMA.

Ethics and dissemination

Ethical approval is not required as no primary data are collected. This systematic review will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) testing — cautions and limitations: While both IGRA and TST provide evidence for infection with Mtb, they cannot distinguish active from latent tuberculosis and the diagnosis of active TB must be excluded prior to treatment for LTBI; a large (> 15 mm) TST reaction is more likely to reflect infection, measurement variability exists for IFN-γ tests (the FDA accepts a variance of 11%), there are insufficient data for quantitative interpretation of IGRAs beyond FDA cut-points, results near the cut-point are less reliable, and the results of IFN-γ testing should be reported quantitatively; discordance between TST and IGRA is common and in low-risk populations discordant tests are likely to be false positives.

Latent tuberculosis infection testing in healthy children under 5 years — The guideline states: "We suggest performing a TST rather than an IGRA in healthy children < 5 years of age for whom it has been decided that diagnostic testing for LTBI is warranted (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence)". It adds, "In situations in which an IGRA is deemed the preferred diagnostic test, some experts are willing to use IGRAs in children over 3 years of age". Cautions note that, in young children, indeterminate IGRA results "range from 0 to 35%", that "an increased rate of indeterminate IGRA results in children < 5 years of age" has been reported, and that blood collection can be challenging because "phlebotomy is more difficult in young children" and "a relatively high incidence of failed phlebotomy has been documented in some studies".

### Update of recommendations for use of once-weekly isoniazid-rifapentine regimen to treat latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection [^117HxFFP]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

In 2011, CDC recommended use of the 3HP regimen by DOT. Treatment completion rates are highest when the regimen is administered by DOT. However, the burden and expense of DOT is greater than that for SAT. During the expert consultation and again during review by ACET, some subject matter experts strongly recommended permitting use of SAT, when combined with clinical monitoring, in children aged ≥ 2 years. Based on this expert opinion, ACET formally recommended expansion of the option of parentally administered SAT to children. Some experts still prefer DOT for treating LTBI in children aged 2–5 years, in whom risk for TB progression and severe disease is higher than that in older children and adults. Health care providers should make joint decisions about SAT with each individual patient (and parent or legal guardian), considering program resources and the patient's age, medical history, social circumstances, and risk factors for progression to severe TB disease. Subject matter experts stressed the importance of educating providers and patients about 3HP.

### Congenital tuberculosis: a rare manifestation of a common infection [^112KSeNP]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The epidemiology of tuberculosis has changed dramatically over the past 5 years with significant shifts in at-risk populations, resulting in increased disease among young adults and children, especially among those from developing countries. Congenital tuberculosis is rare, and the clinical presentation of tuberculosis during pregnancy and infancy is often non-specific, making recognition difficult. Advances have been made with diagnostic tools, in public health practices, and with treatment recommendations. Controversy and debate continue regarding the safety and use of isoniazid for latent tuberculosis infection during pregnancy. New vaccine development may be promising for the future, but much work is needed to understand the complicated immune response to tuberculosis.

Treatment for LTBI — several antibiotics are available; isoniazid was the first medication shown to prevent progression to active tuberculosis, but concerns about hepatotoxicity and drug resistance resulting from low adherence with long courses have prompted recommendations of shorter courses and use in combination with other medications such as rifampin and rifapentine. With the exception of twice-weekly isoniazid monotherapy, CDC-recommended regimens can be self-administered, including a once-weekly combination therapy with isoniazid and rifapentine taken for 3 months.

Pediatric HIV — tuberculosis testing cadence and modality preferences are as follows: Testing should begin during infancy (3–12 months of age) and continue annually (expert opinion), and tuberculin skin test (TST) is preferred over interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) for children aged < 2 years (strong, low). Both TSTs and IGRAs can be used for children with HIV for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) who are ≥ 5 years old, and some experts provide recommendations for testing children ≥ 2 years with IGRAs; IGRAs are preferred for bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-vaccinated people or when TST return rates are low (strong, moderate). After tuberculosis disease has been excluded, all children with HIV with a positive TST or IGRA or with close contact with infectious tuberculosis should receive preventive therapy (strong, high).

Health care providers should recommend the TB blood test if a child:

- Is five years of age or older and
- Has ever received the BCG vaccine. Unlike the TB skin test, TB blood tests are not affected by the BCG vaccine. Latent TB infection Children with latent TB infection can be treated to prevent TB disease. Treatment regimens for children with latent TB infection include:

- Three-month once-weekly regimen of isoniazid and rifapentine, also called 3HP
- Recommended for children older than 2 years of age.
- Recommended for children older than 2 years of age.
- Four-month daily regimen of rifampin also called. 4R
- Recommended for children of any age.
- Recommended for children of any age.
- Three-month daily regimen of isonaizid and rifampin, also called 3HR
- Recommended for children of any age.
- Recommended for children of any age.
- Six- or nine-month daily regimen of isonaizid, also called 6Hor 9H
- Recommended alternative treatment regimens for children of any age.
- Recommended alternative treatment regimens for children of any age. Directly observed therapy Health care providers should consider directly observed therapy for latent TB infection treatment for persons who are at high risk for TB disease and either taking an intermittent regimen or likely to have difficulty with treatment adherence. DOT is a component of case management that helps ensure patients adhere to therapy. During DOT, a health care worker observes patients ingest their medications, monitors them for adverse events, and provides social support.

Window prophylaxis Children less than five years of age who have spent time with an adult with TB disease should receive treatment for latent TB infection even if the initial TB blood test or TB skin test result is negative and less than eight to 10 weeks have passed since the child's last exposure to TB disease. This is called. The 2HRZ/4HR regimen for pulmonary TB disease can treat most forms of extrapulmonary TB disease among children. Exceptions are disseminated TB and TB meningitis, which require treatment for nine to 12 months. Consult a pediatric TB expert for cases of TB meningitis. Directly observed therapy All children and adolescents with TB disease should receive treatment for TB disease using DOT.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommends TSTs for diagnosing LTBI in children 2–5 years old (strong, low); some experts and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Red Book recommend using IGRAs to diagnose LTBI in children ≥ 2 years old (strong, low). CDC and the AAP Red Book recommend TSTs for diagnosing LTBI in children < 2 years old (expert opinion). Younger age (< 5 years), HIV infection itself, and lower CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts have been associated with indeterminate IGRA results and false negative TST results.

* Existing systematic review search: the results from the 2017 analysis were published, citing all primary studies included in the analysis (Zenner D, Beer N, Harris RJ, Lipman MC, Stagg HR, van der Werf MJ. Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: an updated network meta-analysis. Ann Intern Med 2017;167:248–5). Updated search: analyses included combined data from the studies included in the previous review and articles identified during an updated search for studies published during June 2017–August 2018.

All treatment regimens were analyzed using a Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) approach, which allowed for indirect comparisons of treatment regimens when direct comparisons were not available. However, direct, pairwise meta-analysis was the preferred method; the results of the network analysis are presented in this report only if no direct comparisons were available. A full description of the network analysis method has been previously published. NMA allows for indirect comparisons of treatment regimens through inference from a network of evidence. For this analysis, WinBUGS software (version 1.4; Medical Research Council Biostatistics Unit of the University of Cambridge) was used to create the Bayesian network with posterior distributions on the basis of 20,000 samples after a burn-in period of 10,000 iterations. Convergence was assessed by inspecting parameter chains and the Gelman–Rubin diagnostic. Summary statistics and 95% credible intervals were obtained from posterior distributions. Network inconsistency, which can arise if indirect comparisons conflict with direct pairwise estimates, was assessed by comparison with standard meta-analysis and by using the omnibus test for consistency.

The overall quality of evidence was appraised using the GRADE approach, and GRADEpro software was used to develop evidence profiles that summarized the quality of evidence for each outcome (high, moderate, low, or very low) and the rationale for the quality of evidence appraisal. Head-to-head comparisons of regimens evaluated in clinical trials were evaluated according to the populations studied: adults, children, HIV positive, and HIV negative. References for all of the studies included in the analyses are available (Supplementary Tables;).

### Tuberculosis (TB)-TB treatment for children… [^117DZPaM]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

TB Treatment for Children On December 31, 2024, the American Thoracic Society, CDC, the European Respiratory Society, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America published updated clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant tuberculosis disease in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. A pediatric TB expert should be involved in the treatment of TB in children and in the management of infants, young children, and immunocompromised children who have been exposed to someone with infectious TB disease. It is very important that children or anyone being treated for latent TB infection or TB disease take the drugs exactly as instructed by the doctor and finish the medicine. Latent TB Infection Treatment for Children Treatment is recommended for children with latent TB infection to prevent them from developing TB disease.

Infants, young children, and immunocompromised children with latent TB infection or children in close contact with someone with infectious TB disease, require special consideration because they are at increased risk for getting TB disease. Consultation with a pediatric TB expert is recommended before treatment begins. Children over 2 years of age can be treated for latent TB infection with once-weekly isoniazid-rifapentine for 12 weeks. Alternative treatments for latent TB infection in children include 4 months of daily rifampin or 9 months of daily isoniazid. The regimens are equally acceptable; however, health care providers should prescribe the more convenient shorter regimens, when possible. Patients are more likely to complete shorter treatment regimens. TB Disease Treatment for Children TB disease in children is treated by taking several anti-TB medicines for 4, 6, or 9 months, depending on the treatment regimen.

CDC does not recommend the 4-month rifapentine-moxifloxacin TB treatment regimen for children who are younger than 12 years old or have a body weight below 40 kilograms. If a child stops taking the drugs before completion, the child can become sick again. If drugs are not taken correctly, the bacteria that are still alive may become resistant to those drugs. TB that is resistant to drugs is harder and more expensive to treat, and treatment lasts much longer.

### Safety and side effects of rifampin versus isoniazid in children [^112eBq5C]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

The treatment of latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis is important in children because of their vulnerability to life-threatening forms of tuberculosis disease. The current standard treatment - 9 months of isoniazid - has been associated with poor adherence and toxic effects, which have hampered the effectiveness of the drug. In adults, treatment with 4 months of rifampin has been shown to be safer and to have higher completion rates than 9 months of isoniazid.

Methods

In this multicenter, open-label trial, we randomly assigned 844 children (< 18 years of age) with latent M. tuberculosis infection to receive either 4 months of rifampin or 9 months of isoniazid. The primary outcome was adverse events of grade 1 to 5 that resulted in the permanent discontinuation of a trial drug. Secondary outcomes were treatment adherence, side-effect profile, and efficacy. Independent review panels whose members were unaware of trial-group assignments adjudicated all adverse events and progression to active tuberculosis.

Results

Of the children who underwent randomization, 829 were eligible for inclusion in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. A total of 360 of 422 children (85.3%) in the rifampin group completed per-protocol therapy, as compared with 311 of 407 (76.4%) in the isoniazid group (adjusted difference in the rates of treatment completion, 13.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI] 7.5 to 19.3). There were no significant between-group differences in the rates of adverse events, with fewer than 5% of the children in the combined groups with grade 1 or 2 adverse events that were deemed to be possibly related to a trial drug. Active tuberculosis, including 1 case with resistance to isoniazid, was diagnosed in 2 children in the isoniazid group during 542 person-years of follow-up, as compared with no cases in the rifampin group during 562 person-years (rate difference, -0.37 cases per 100 person-years; 95% CI, -0.88 to 0.14).

Conclusions

Among children under the age of 18 years, treatment with 4 months of rifampin had similar rates of safety and efficacy but a better rate of adherence than 9 months of treatment with isoniazid.

Recommendations of others regarding LTBI screening state that the CDC, together with the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America, recommends screening for LTBI to identify persons who may benefit from treatment before progression to active tuberculosis infection. Joint guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended screening for latent tuberculosis in early pregnancy for women at high risk for tuberculosis, with risk examples including recent tuberculosis exposure, HIV infection, immune-suppressing drugs, kidney failure with dialysis, homelessness, living or working in long-term care facilities, being medically underserved, and being born in a country with high tuberculosis prevalence; the American Academy of Family Physicians supports the 2016 USPSTF recommendation on screening for LTBI.

### Advances in diagnosis and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection [^113BsXit]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

In the United States, latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) affects between 10 and 15 million people, of whom 10% may develop active tuberculosis disease. People at increased risk for tuberculosis reactivation include recent immigrants from countries with a high incidence of tuberculosis, children younger than age 5, people who have been infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis within the past 2 years, or people with immunosuppression for a variety of reasons. Appropriate diagnosis and treatment of LTBI are critical for controlling and eventually eliminating tuberculosis as a public health problem. Although the tuberculin skin test is the traditional diagnostic measure for LTBI, reduced specificity has promoted the development and utilization of the interferon-γ release assays as an in vitro blood test with specific antigens to M. tuberculosis (QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test and the T.SPOT-TB test are commercially available). Despite the rise of the new diagnostic tests, however, there is still no gold standard for diagnosing LTBI, and epidemiologic risks and comorbidities need to be taken into account before initiating therapy. Current diagnostic tests combined with recommended treatment regimens are valuable tools that, when used correctly, promise to hurry the elimination of tuberculosis.

### Guidelines for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2020 [^112qWMWC]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

These updated guidelines were developed by NTCA and CDC. The LTBI treatment guidelines committee members, who are the authors of this report, were nominated on the basis of their expertise in treatment of LTBI. The committee had expertise in epidemiology, domestic and international TB control, clinical trials, and treatment of LTBI in adults and children. A methodologist with expertise in the GRADE approach served as a consultant to the guideline development committee.

Evidence Search

The committee determined that the following clinical question should be addressed in the updated guidelines: "Which regimens for treatment of latent tuberculosis infection have the greatest effectiveness and least toxicity?" The question was written in the population, intervention, comparator, outcomes (PICO) format, and then the outcomes were rated as critical, important, or not important. Comparison of regimen toxicities was limited to hepatotoxicity because this was the only toxicity that could be consistently compared across studies.

A systematic literature review was initiated in December 2017. Electronic databases including MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and gray literature were searched for studies evaluating the effectiveness of LTBI treatment regimens. Search terms included "latent tuberculosis", "latent TB", "LTBI", " Mycobacterium tuberculosis, " "tuberculosis infection" AND "isoniazid", "rifampin", "rifapentine", or "pyrazinamide". Articles were included if the study design was a randomized controlled trial and outcomes included prevention of TB disease and drug-related hepatotoxicity. Studies that included persons with suspected or confirmed TB disease were excluded from the review.

The initial search located a high-quality systematic review and meta-analysis published in August 2017 that examined the effectiveness of LTBI treatment regimens. The study authors were contacted and asked for access to the extracted data. Study characteristics, types of participants, interventions, the outcomes measured, and results were extracted from each study. If the data were amenable to pooling, effects were estimated via meta-analysis. For the meta-analyses, a random effects model was used unless otherwise specified, and effect estimates were reported as odds ratios. All statistical analyses were conducted using the "metafor" package in R, versions 3.4.3. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to conduct a bias assessment. Analyses conducted in 2018 included combined data from the studies in the previous review and articles identified during an updated search for studies published during June 2017–August 2018 (Figure).

Testing for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) — IGRA preferred over TST in specific adults and children: Our recommendations for diagnostic testing for LTBI are based upon the likelihood of infection with Mtb and the likelihood of progression to TB disease if infected, as illustrated in Figure 1. We recommend performing an interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) rather than a tuberculin skin test (TST) in individuals 5 years or older who meet the following criteria: (1) are likely to be infected with Mtb, (2) have a low or intermediate risk of disease progression, (3) it has been decided that testing for LTBI is warranted, and (4) either have a history of BCG vaccination or are unlikely to return to have their TST read (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Alternative Regimens: Six or Nine Months of Daily Isoniazid

Regimens of 6 or 9 months of daily isoniazid are alternative recommended regimens; 6 months daily is strongly recommended for HIV-negative adults and children of all ages and conditionally for HIV-positive adults and children of all ages and 9 months daily is conditionally recommended for adults and children of all ages, both HIV-negative and HIV-positive. Isoniazid reduces the risk for developing TB disease in persons with a positive TST, including HIV-negative adults and children, HIV-positive adults, and presumably also HIV-positive children. The drug can cause hepatotoxicity and be associated with discontinuation because of adverse effects, although these effects are more common in adults than children.

In HIV-positive persons who have a negative TST, anergy, or an unknown TST, the benefit of isoniazid is uncertain in settings with low TB incidence. For these HIV-positive persons, the potential exists for a reduction in the incidence of TB disease and an increase in adverse effects with isoniazid therapy; however, the likelihood of these effects remains uncertain because of wide confidence intervals resulting from too few events.

The evidence synthesis included multiple durations of isoniazid therapy in persons with a positive TST (3, 6, and 12 months in HIV-negative persons and 6 months in HIV-positive persons). Among HIV-negative persons with inactive TB (defined as the presence of tuberculin positivity, stable fibrotic lung lesions, and negative sputum cultures in persons not previously treated), 6 and 12 months of therapy were more effective than 3 months of therapy, demonstrating the benefit of LTBI treatment with isoniazid in this high-risk subset of patients with LTBI. Studies of other regimens have persons with LTBI and fibrotic lesions but in much smaller numbers. According to the results of the systematic review process, among HIV-positive persons, 6 months of therapy was highly effective, and the effect of other durations was unknown. Also reviewed was an analysis that included different, fewer trials than included in this report and found that 9 months of daily isoniazid therapy was perhaps more effective than 6 months and similar to 12 months (,–). However, no clinical trial data were available directly comparing 9 months of isoniazid to placebo, 6 months of isoniazid, or 12 months of isoniazid.

Three Months of Daily Isoniazid Plus Rifampin

A regimen of 3 months of daily isoniazid plus rifampin is a preferred treatment that is conditionally recommended for adults and children of all ages and for HIV-positive persons as drug interactions allow. HIV-negative adults and children with a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) who received 3 months of daily isoniazid plus rifampin appeared to have a similar risk for TB disease, hepatotoxicity, and adverse effects requiring discontinuation of therapy as those who received ≥ 6 months of isoniazid. Among children aged < 15 years specifically, a 3-month course of daily isoniazid plus rifampin appeared as effective as a 6-month or longer course of isoniazid, because direct comparisons found no difference in TB disease and no differences in adverse effects requiring discontinuation of therapy or hepatotoxicity. In HIV-positive persons, no difference was found in the incidence of TB disease among those who received 3 months of daily isoniazid plus rifampin compared with those who received ≥ 6 months of isoniazid monotherapy, regardless of whether they were TST positive, TST negative, or anergic. Hepatotoxicity was less frequent among those receiving the shorter course of therapy, although discontinuation of therapy because of adverse effects was more frequent.

Potential drug interactions with rifampin and acquired drug resistance if TB disease is not adequately excluded also are important considerations (see previous section on 4 months of daily rifampin). In addition, hepatotoxicity risk might be greater with the two drugs given together than with either drug given alone.

Treatment of latent M. tuberculosis infection

Tracing contacts of infectious pulmonary TB cases (sputum smear-positive) for exposure to tubercle bacilli leading to latent M. tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and treatment of latently-infected individuals at high risk of progressing from latent infection to active disease has proven extremely effective in the control of TB in the United States and other low TB-burden countries. Treatment of LTBI in infected persons substantially reduces the likelihood of activation of dormant infection and subsequent development of active TB disease (Figure 1). The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued guidelines in 2000 for the treatment of LTBI which were also endorsed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and American Academy of Pediatrics. An update to these guidelines was published in 2005 that also included recommendations for pediatric subjects. The treatment options currently available for LTBI are summarized in Table 2.

Latent TB Terminology: Origins, Evolution, and Pervasion/Pervasiveness

Since 1971, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) has regularly issued TB treatment guidelines. In 1994, these guidelines issued recommendations for the treatment of TB disease and TB infection with no mention of the word "latent". In 1999, the ATS issued for the first time a separate guideline that specifically addressed "latent tuberculosis infection" Not only did the terminology for TB infection change to LTBI, the terminology for its treatment also changed — from "preventive treatment" to "treatment of LTBI". The recommended treatment for LTBI (isoniazid monotherapy) remained unchanged from that for its namesake (TB infection) in 1994. The 1999 guidelines offered neither an explanation for the new name nor a definition. Rather, the definition was in a separate document published contemporaneously that contained guidelines for the diagnosis of TB. Here, LTBI was defined as "a positive reaction to the tuberculin skin test (TST), negative bacteriologic studies (if done), and no clinical, bacteriologic or radiologic evidence of active tuberculosis". In 2017, the updated guidelines modified the LTBI definition to "a state of persistent immune response to stimulation by Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens with no evidence of clinically manifest active TB".

The influential role of the ATS guidelines is reflected by endorsements from key organizations, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the American Academy of Pediatrics. It is not surprising then that their changed terminology for the exact same clinical condition — radiological evidence of inactive TB and/or TB immunoreactivity — had a profound influence on the field. Indeed, a PubMed search suggests this, showing a surge of papers using the term "latent tuberculosis" starting in 2000 (Figure 1). We did, however, find occasional indexed papers on latent TB as far back as 1894. Surely, the definition of latent TB in the 19th and early 20th century papers could not have been the same as the current one, given that the earliest articles predated tuberculin testing. What could latent TB have meant in the pretuberculin era? To understand this, we took our search back further, and identified the term "phthisie latent" (latent phthisis) in papers as early as 1819. Thus, the concept of latent TB predated not only tuberculin testing but also, by more than 60 years, the discovery of the tubercle bacillus.

Expert Consultation

In July 2017, CDC met with nine non subject matter experts in TB and LTBI diagnosis, treatment, prevention, surveillance, epidemiology, clinical research, pulmonology, pediatrics, HIV/AIDS, public health programs, and patient advocacy. CDC presented the systematic review results and proposed recommendations to the experts, who provided 1) individual perspectives on the review; 2) experience with implementation of the 3HP regimen in various settings and populations; and 3) individual viewpoints on the proposed updates. Subject matter experts from programs prescribing 3HP described benefits of this regimen, including increased acceptance and completion of treatment. Some experts reported that several health departments are currently using 3HP, with high treatment completion, in children as young as age 2 years. Some noted that the 2011 recommendation to administer 3HP by DOT limits use of the regimen. In December 2017, CDC solicited input from ACET and members of the public for incorporation into the final recommendations.

With regard to pediatric use, the 2011 recommendations had included limited use of the 3HP regimen for treatment of LTBI in children aged < 12 years. New data on efficacy and safety of 3HP in children were determined sufficient to recommend the 3HP regimen for treatment of LTBI in children aged ≥ 2 years.

Concerning patients with HIV infection, information about interactions between specific antimycobacterial agents, including rifamycins (e.g. rifampin, rifabutin, and rifapentine) and antiretroviral agents, is available in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents. These frequently updated guidelines include a section addressing management of LTBI in persons with HIV coinfection and tables with information on drug interactions. * Use of concomitant LTBI treatment and antiretroviral agents should be guided by clinicians experienced in the management of both conditions.

Discussion

A systematic literature review was performed of clinical trial data pertaining to effectiveness and toxicity of treatment of LTBI, including studies published since the 2018 World Health Organization LTBI guidelines. Evidence quality was evaluated using the GRADE approach, and a network meta-analysis was performed, updated to include data from studies published since a previous network meta-analysis, to compare regimens not evaluated head-to-head in clinical trials.

Recommendations were formulated on the basis of the balance of desirable and undesirable consequences of the intervention, the quality of evidence, patient values and preferences, and feasibility. These factors also informed the priority rank of the regimens as preferred or alternative, with preference for shorter regimens, given their similar efficacy compared with 6–9 months of isoniazid but favorable tolerability and higher treatment completion rates. This combination of characteristics should result in greater effectiveness of the shorter regimens in clinical settings. More effective treatment of LTBI will facilitate TB elimination. Prescribing providers or pharmacists who are unfamiliar with rifampin and rifapentine might confuse the two drugs. They are not interchangeable, and caution should be taken to ensure that patients receive the correct medication for the intended regimen.

Although 9 months of isoniazid was a preferred regimen in the guidelines published in 2000, both 6 and 9 months of isoniazid were recommended at that time. In these current guidelines, application of GRADE criteria resulted in a strong recommendation for 6 months of isoniazid as an alternative for those persons unable to take a shorter preferred regimen (e.g. due to drug intolerability or drug-drug interactions), particularly in HIV-negative persons. The longer duration of isoniazid could increase the risk for hepatotoxicity and although increased effectiveness is plausible, the two treatment durations have not been directly compared.

Two months of rifampin plus pyrazinamide are not recommended for treatment of LTBI because of the hepatotoxicity risk. However, in persons treated empirically for TB disease with isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide for 2 months, this regimen will effectively treat LTBI in persons subsequently determined to have LTBI rather than TB disease.

Development of Recommendations

The committee discussed evidence during face-to-face meetings and teleconferences. GRADE evidence tables were prioritized according to the regimens, comparisons, and study populations that were deemed most clinically relevant to the United States. If discrepancies between GRADE head-to-head comparisons and network meta-analysis results were found, the committee prioritized the GRADE comparisons. Recommendations were formulated on the basis of the following considerations: the balance of desirable consequences of the intervention (benefits) and undesirable consequences (regimen complexity, adverse effects, and cost), the quality of evidence, patient values and preferences, and feasibility. The desirable and undesirable consequences considered by the committee included both those related to individuals and to overall public health.

A strong GRADE recommendation for a regimen was made if the panel concluded that the desirable consequences of the intervention outweighed the undesirable consequences, the majority of well-informed patients would choose the regimen, and the evidence was at least moderate quality. A conditional GRADE recommendation was made for a regimen when uncertainty existed regarding whether the desirable consequences outweighed the undesirable consequences (e.g. low-quality evidence for a critical outcome such that additional evidence could change key findings, hence the recommendation). A conditional recommendation indicates that well-informed patients might make different choices regarding whether to choose the regimen.

The panel also prioritized recommended regimens as either preferred or alternative. Preferred regimens were defined as having excellent tolerability and efficacy, shorter treatment duration, and higher completion rates. Alternative regimens were defined as having excellent efficacy but longer treatment duration and lower completion rates. The rationale for prioritizing the regimens was that treatment completion rates are higher with shorter regimens; if regimens have similar efficacy and safety, the shorter regimen is more effective because completion rates are higher.

Draft recommendations were publicly presented during the U.S. Advisory Council on the Elimination of Tuberculosis meeting on December 11, 2018, and at the NTCA meeting on April 23, 2019. The recommendations were positively received at both meetings, and no substantive changes were made to the recommendations thereafter.

### Latent tuberculosis infection in children: a call for revised treatment guidelines [^114G1tr6]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines for latent tuberculosis infection do not consider drug-resistance patterns when recommending treatment for immigrant children.

Objectives

The purpose of this research was to decide at what rate of isoniazid resistance a different regimen other than isoniazid for 9 months should be considered.

Methods

We constructed a decision tree by using published data. We studied 3 regimens considered to be effective for susceptible organisms: (1) isoniazid for 9 months, (2) rifampin for 6 months, and (3) isoniazid for 9 months plus rifampin for 6 months. In addition, we evaluated a regimen of isoniazid and rifampin for 3 months. Our base case was a 2-year-old child from Russia with a tuberculin skin test reaction of 12 mm. We assumed a societal perspective and expressed results as cost and cost per case of tuberculosis prevented. We conducted sensitivity analyses to test the stability of our model.

Results

In our baseline analysis, rifampin was the least costly treatment regimen for any child arriving from an area with an isoniazid-resistance rate of ≥ 11%. Treatment with isoniazid plus rifampin was the most effective but would cost more than $1 million per reactivation case prevented. Isoniazid would become the least costly regimen if any of the following thresholds were met: rifampin resistance given isoniazid resistance of more than 82%; rifampin resistance given no isoniazid resistance of > 9%; cost of rifampin more than $47/month; effectiveness of rifampin lower than 63%; effectiveness of isoniazid higher than 74%; and cost of pulmonary tuberculosis less than $7661. Isoniazid and rifampin for 3 months was the least costly for all cases from areas with isoniazid resistance of < 80% as long as the regimen's effectiveness was > 50% for susceptible bacteria. However, this assumption remains to be proven.

Conclusion

Because of the high prevalence of isoniazid resistance, rifampin should be considered for children with latent tuberculosis infection originating from countries with > 11% isoniazid resistance.

### Prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection among healthy young children and adolescents and a two-step approach for the diagnosis of tuberculosis infection in chengdu, China [^111rKLxL]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

China has a high burden of tuberculosis and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of LTBI among healthy young children and adolescents and test a 2-step approach to explore the threshold for the diagnosis of tuberculosis infection in Chengdu, China.

Methods

Healthy preschool children and school-going children in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, were screened for LTBI using the tuberculin skin test (TST). Preschool children with TST ≥ 5mm also underwent interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) to explore the threshold of this 2-step approach.

Results

In total, 5667 healthy young children and adolescents completed TST test between July 2020 and January 2021 and were included in the present analysis. The age of the participants ranged from 2.4 to 18 years (median 7.25 ± 4.514 years), of which 2093 (36.9%) were younger than 5 years. The overall prevalence of LTBI was 6.37% and 6.64% in children younger than 5 years old. Fourteen of the 341 preschool children with TST ≥ 5mm were interferon-γ release assay positive, of which 4 showed a TST result of 5–10mm, and 6 preschool children received preventive treatment for LTBI.

Conclusions

Healthy young children and adolescents should also be considered as important target populations for LTBI screening. TST can be recommended for first-line screening as part of a 2-step approach for LTBI screening using a positive threshold of 5mm.

### Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: an updated network meta-analysis [^115iBgZC]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is an important component of tuberculosis (TB) control, and this study updates a previous network meta-analysis of the best LTBI treatment options to inform public health action and programmatic management of LTBI.

Purpose

To evaluate the comparative efficacy and harms of LTBI treatment regimens aimed at preventing active TB among adults and children.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from indexing to 8 May 2017; clinical trial registries; and conference abstracts. No language restrictions were applied.

Study Selection

Randomized controlled trials that evaluated human LTBI treatments and recorded at least 1 of 2 prespecified end points (hepatotoxicity and prevention of active TB).

Data Extraction

2 investigators independently extracted data from eligible studies and assessed study quality according to a standard protocol.

Data Synthesis

The network meta-analysis of 8 new and 53 previously included studies showed that isoniazid regimens of 6 months (odds ratio [OR], 0.65 [95% credible interval {CrI}, 0.50 to 0.83]) or 12 to 72 months (OR, 0.50 [CrI, 0.41 to 0.62]), rifampicin-only regimens (OR, 0.41 [CrI, 0.19 to 0.85]), rifampicin-isoniazid regimens of 3 to 4 months (OR, 0.53 [CrI, 0.36 to 0.78]), rifampicin-isoniazid-pyrazinamide regimens (OR, 0.35 [CrI, 0.19 to 0.61]), and rifampicin-pyrazinamide regimens (OR, 0.53 [CrI, 0.33 to 0.84]) were efficacious compared with placebo. Evidence existed for efficacy of weekly rifapentine-isoniazid regimens compared with no treatment (OR, 0.36 [CrI, 0.18 to 0.73]). No conclusive evidence showed that HIV status altered treatment efficacy.

Limitation

Evidence was sparse for many comparisons and hepatotoxicity outcomes, and risk of bias was high or unknown for many studies.

Conclusion

Evidence exists for the efficacy and safety of 6-month isoniazid monotherapy, rifampicin monotherapy, and combination therapies with 3 to 4 months of isoniazid and rifampicin.

Other Considerations

Following are several considerations for the use of these guidelines. First, the committee did not include cost-effectiveness in evaluating the evidence; recommendations were based on evaluating effectiveness and toxicity of the regimens. Second, the committee did not evaluate evidence regarding how to implement these regimens programmatically (e.g. who to test and treat and management of side effects). Third, these guidelines focus on treatment regimens for persons with LTBI living in countries with low TB disease incidence. These guidelines do not address other empiric TB prevention strategies (e.g. 1 month of isoniazid plus rifapentine among HIV-positive persons living in settings with a high TB incidence regardless of results from the TST or an interferon-gamma release assay). Finally, shorter regimens should not be used for patients in whom rifamycins are contraindicated, including those taking medications with significant drug-drug interactions with rifamycins.
