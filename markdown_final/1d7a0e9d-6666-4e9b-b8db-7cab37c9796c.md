## Question

What is nociceptive pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a definition of nociceptive pain, including its mechanisms, distinguishing features, and how it differs from neuropathic and nociplastic pain, with attention to mixed states and clinical implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formal definition and core concept. Then, I should verify the neurophysiological mechanisms from transduction through perception. Next, I will examine clinical characteristics and diagnostic clues. After that, I need to differentiate nociceptive pain from neuropathic and nociplastic pain. Then, I should consider mixed pain states and the acute-to-chronic transition. Finally, I will review clinical implications for assessment and treatment and synthesize a concise, clinically useful definition anchored in current taxonomy and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the formal definition so I don't drift into colloquial usage. Nociceptive pain is pain arising from actual or threatened damage to non-neural tissue and is due to activation of nociceptors in a normal sensory nervous system; it is typically acute and resolves with healing of the underlying tissue injury or inflammation, which aligns with the IASP-endorsed mechanistic triad of nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic pain [^112MkLJ6] [^111rmTk4] [^1177qQW6].

> Wait, let me verify the neurophysiology so I don't oversimplify. Nociception proceeds in four stages: transduction at nociceptor endings, transmission to the spinal cord, modulation within dorsal horn circuits, and perception in higher centers; nociceptors include medium-threshold myelinated Aδ fibers for rapid "first pain" and high-threshold unmyelinated C fibers for delayed "second pain", with ion channels such as TRPs and ASICs mediating transduction of thermal, mechanical, and chemical stimuli into receptor potentials and action potentials that ascend via spinothalamic pathways to the brain [^1118Bd2n] [^114XvPZX] [^114zCQkH] [^112izMz9].

> Hold on, I should verify the clinical phenotype so I don't overgeneralize. Somatic nociceptive pain is typically well-localized, reproducible with the inciting stimulus, and proportional to the degree of tissue injury; visceral nociceptive pain tends to be diffuse, poorly localized, and may present with referred pain and autonomic accompaniments such as nausea or diaphoresis; descriptors like stinging, lacerating, heavy, or suffocating are often used and can help cue the clinician to a nociceptive source when aligned with exam and imaging findings [^1177qQW6].

> I need to ensure I clearly distinguish nociceptive pain from neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain arises from a lesion or disease of the somatosensory system and lacks normal transduction of a peripheral noxious stimulus; clinically, it often features spontaneous pain, paresthesias, dysesthesias, and evoked phenomena such as allodynia and hyperalgesia, and it tends to be more refractory to conventional analgesics than nociceptive pain, reflecting different underlying mechanisms and prognosis [^114ZA4DH] [^116RQd13] [^114KbbEB].

> But wait, what about nociplastic pain; I should double-check the criteria. Nociplastic pain reflects altered nociception without clear evidence of ongoing tissue damage or somatosensory system disease; it is characterized by widespread or regional pain with hypersensitivity features and often co-occurring CNS symptoms such as fatigue, sleep disturbance, and cognitive or mood changes, and it is less responsive to peripherally directed therapies like anti-inflammatories, opioids, injections, or surgery, necessitating centrally targeted strategies [^112MkLJ6] [^111rmTk4] [^111HmrGq].

> Let me consider mixed pain states so I don't prematurely assign a single mechanism. Many chronic pain conditions, including low back pain, osteoarthritis, and complex regional pain syndrome, harbor overlapping nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic components that can shift over time; for example, a herniated disc may produce nociceptive inflammation, neuropathic nerve root compression, and secondary nociplastic central sensitization, underscoring the need for repeated phenotyping and mechanism-aligned treatment adjustments [^112MkLJ6] [^1124pN5G] [^113WF6BT].

> I should confirm the acute-to-chronic transition and central sensitization so I don't underappreciate pathophysiology. Continued nociceptive input can drive peripheral and central sensitization, with wind-up, expanded receptive fields, and secondary hyperalgesia and allodynia; this plasticity helps explain why persistent nociceptive pain can evolve into a maladaptive state even after peripheral pathology ostensibly resolves, reinforcing the importance of early, mechanism-informed management to interrupt this trajectory [^114HDY71] [^111u6gEJ] [^111MfcYC].

> Next, I should review clinical assessment and treatment implications so the definition is actionable. Mechanism-based classification guides therapy: nociceptive pain often responds to peripherally directed treatments such as NSAIDs, acetaminophen, local interventions, and time-limited opioids in severe acute cases, whereas neuropathic pain benefits from agents like gabapentinoids, SNRIs, TCAs, and targeted procedures, and nociplastic pain emphasizes nonpharmacologic, centrally acting approaches including exercise, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and neuromodulation; careful history, examination, and judicious use of QST or validated tools can aid discrimination, though no single biomarker reliably separates categories yet [^114fzyWw] [^112MkLJ6] [^111CYeSc] [^117LC6zi].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied nociception equals pain; I should correct that. Nociception is necessary but not sufficient for pain, as pain is a subjective, multidimensional experience shaped by ascending nociceptive signals and descending modulatory, cognitive, and affective processes; thus, nociceptive pain reflects a normal protective alarm to tissue threat, whereas persistent or disproportionate pain signals a shift toward maladaptive processing that may include central sensitization and mixed mechanisms [^112LcDgK] [^114xgZ2C] [^111uLXqM].

> In summary, nociceptive pain is the adaptive, protective pain that arises from activation of nociceptors by actual or threatened non-neural tissue injury, characterized by well-localized, stimulus-linked discomfort that typically resolves with healing; it is distinct from neuropathic pain due to somatosensory system disease and from nociplastic pain due to altered nociception without clear peripheral drivers, yet it frequently coexists with these mechanisms in chronic conditions, demanding mechanism-aware assessment and individualized, evolving treatment plans [^112MkLJ6] [^111rmTk4] [^114fzyWw].

Nociceptive pain is **pain caused by activation of nociceptors** in response to actual or threatened non-neural tissue injury, such as mechanical, thermal, or chemical stimuli. It is typically **well-localized, proportional to the stimulus, and resolves with healing** of the underlying tissue damage [^1177qQW6]. Nociceptive pain is distinct from neuropathic pain (nerve injury) [^114ZA4DH] and nociplastic pain (altered nociception without tissue or nerve damage) [^111rmTk4], and is managed with anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, and opioids for severe cases [^1133gdxS].

---

## Physiological mechanisms

Nociceptive pain involves a **multistep process**:

- **Transduction**: Nociceptors convert noxious stimuli into electrical signals [^1118Bd2n] via ion channels (e.g. TRPV1, ASICs) [^114zCQkH] [^112izMz9] and receptors [^112izMz9].

- **Transmission**: Action potentials travel via Aδ and C fibers to the spinal cord, then to the brain via spinothalamic and spinoreticular pathways [^114XvPZX] [^114zLsdc].

- **Modulation**: Spinal and supraspinal mechanisms [^112c76JA] can amplify or dampen nociceptive signals, contributing to hyperalgesia or analgesia [^114HDY71] [^1123iQML].

- **Perception**: The brain integrates sensory and emotional inputs, producing the subjective experience of pain [^1173q8bJ].

---

## Clinical characteristics

Nociceptive pain has **distinct clinical features**:

- **Localization**: Typically well-localized and proportional to the stimulus [^1177qQW6].

- **Quality**: Described as sharp, aching, or throbbing [^notfound].

- **Resolution**: Tends to resolve with healing of the underlying tissue damage [^1177qQW6].

- **Examples**: Includes inflammatory pain (e.g. arthritis), mechanical pain (e.g. fractures), and ischemic pain (e.g. myocardial infarction) [^notfound].

---

## Differentiation from other pain types

Nociceptive pain differs from **neuropathic pain**, which results from nerve injury and presents with burning, tingling, or electric shock-like sensations [^114ZA4DH], and from **nociplastic pain**, which arises from altered nociception without tissue or nerve damage and is often widespread and persistent [^112MkLJ6] [^111rmTk4].

---

## Clinical examples

Common **examples** of nociceptive pain include:

| **Condition** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Arthritis | Inflammatory pain from joint inflammation [^116X5vox] |
| Fractures | Mechanical pain from bone injury [^114JmLXH] |
| Burns | Thermal pain from skin injury [^111LtXwX] |
| Myocardial infarction | Ischemic pain from cardiac tissue injury [^notfound] |

---

## Management strategies

Management of nociceptive pain includes:

- **Pharmacological treatments**: NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and opioids for severe pain [^1133gdxS].

- **Non-pharmacological treatments**: Physical therapy, acupuncture, and cognitive-behavioral therapy [^notfound].

- **Addressing underlying cause**: Treating the underlying tissue injury or inflammation is essential for resolution [^1177qQW6].

---

Nociceptive pain is a **protective response to tissue injury** [^115JpNcw], characterized by well-localized, proportional pain that resolves with healing. It is distinct from neuropathic and nociplastic pain and is managed with anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, and opioids for severe cases [^1133gdxS].

### Patient-reported outcomes and quantitative sensory testing: are they useful to investigate neuropathic pain mechanisms and predict therapeutic response? [^1129UjJy]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Currently, there are no quantitative pain biomarkers mechanistically assessing the nociceptive system function or analgesic efficacy, which is crucial for developing personalized pain therapies. This lack of specific biomarkers is likely a significant factor in the failure to develop new targeted pain management strategies, potentially leading to the overuse of opioids in chronic pain. Two methodologies-patient-reported outcomes and quantitative sensory testing-offer potential clinical markers that could help close these gaps. This brief review will discuss the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches as well as their implications for the future.

### Nociceptors – noxious stimulus detectors [^115JpNcw]. Neuron (2007). Low credibility.

In order to deal effectively with danger, it is imperative to know about it. This is what nociceptors do — these primary sensory neurons are specialized to detect intense stimuli and represent, therefore, the first line of defense against any potentially threatening or damaging environmental inputs. By sensing noxious stimuli and contributing to the necessary reactions to avoid them — rapid withdrawal and the experience of an intensely unpleasant or painful sensation, nociceptors are essential for the maintenance of the body's integrity. Although nociceptive pain is clearly an adaptive alarm system, persistent pain is maladaptive, essentially an ongoing false alarm. Here, we highlight the genesis of nociceptors during development and the intrinsic properties of nociceptors that enable them to transduce, conduct, and transmit nociceptive information and also discuss how their phenotypic plasticity contributes to clinical pain.

### Can we conquer pain? [^111ZHSv5]. Nature Neuroscience (2002). Medium credibility.

Pain can be an adaptive sensation, an early warning to protect the body from tissue injury. By the introduction of hypersensitivity to normally innocuous stimuli, pain may also aid in repair after tissue damage. Pain can also be maladaptive, reflecting pathological function of the nervous system. Multiple molecular and cellular mechanisms operate alone and in combination within the peripheral and central nervous systems to produce the different forms of pain. Elucidation of these mechanisms is key to the development of treatments that specifically target underlying causes rather than just symptoms. This new approach promises to revolutionize pain diagnosis and management.

### Assessing pain objectively: the use of physiological markers [^116F5TKD]. Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Pain diagnosis and management would benefit from the development of objective markers of nociception and pain. Current research addressing this issue has focused on five main strategies, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. These encompass: (i) monitoring changes in the autonomic nervous system; (ii) biopotentials; (iii) neuroimaging; (iv) biological (bio-) markers; and (v) composite algorithms. Although each strategy has shown areas of promise, there are currently no validated objective markers of nociception or pain that can be recommended for clinical use. This article introduces the most important developments in the field and highlights shortcomings, with the aim of allowing the reader to make informed decisions about what trends to watch in the future.

### Molecular mechanisms of nociception [^1166gETf]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

The sensation of pain alerts us to real or impending injury and triggers appropriate protective responses. Unfortunately, pain often outlives its usefulness as a warning system and instead becomes chronic and debilitating. This transition to a chronic phase involves changes within the spinal cord and brain, but there is also remarkable modulation where pain messages are initiated - at the level of the primary sensory neuron. Efforts to determine how these neurons detect pain-producing stimuli of a thermal, mechanical or chemical nature have revealed new signalling mechanisms and brought us closer to understanding the molecular events that facilitate transitions from acute to persistent pain.

### Persistent pain as a disease entity: implications for clinical management [^111Z4DCT]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2004). Low credibility.

Pain has often been regarded merely as a symptom that serves as a passive warning signal of an underlying disease process. Using this model, the goal of treatment has been to identify and address the pathology causing pain in the expectation that this would lead to its resolution. However, there is accumulating evidence to indicate that persistent pain cannot be regarded as a passive symptom. Continuing nociceptive inputs result in a multitude of consequences that impact on the individual, ranging from changes in receptor function to mood dysfunction, inappropriate cognitions, and social disruption. These changes that occur as a consequence of continuing nociceptive inputs argue for the consideration of persistent pain as a disease entity in its own right. As with any disease, the extent of these changes is largely determined by the internal and external environments in which they occur. Thus genetic, psychological and social factors may all contribute to the perception and expression of persistent pain. Optimal outcomes in the management of persistent pain may be achieved not simply by attempting to remove the cause of the pain, but by addressing both the consequences and contributors that together comprise the disease of persistent pain.

Introduction

Nociception is the neural process of encoding noxious stimuli, whereas pain is defined as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage. Nociception has been described in a variety of organisms, from the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans through to humans, but the case for pain is less clear. Although humans and likely all mammals experience negative emotion, this is considered unlikely in C. elegans, but the case for certain organisms, especially fish, is more contentious. Numerous reviews have been written about different aspects of pain, from its molecular basis and genetic mechanisms to its pharmacological treatment. The purpose of this review is to discuss how recent insights into pain mechanisms from pre-clinical research may lead to breakthroughs in our understanding, and hopefully treatment, of chronic pain.

Chronic pain is usually defined as regularly occurring pain over a period of several months and it has a prevalence of ~11–19% of the adult population. Broadly speaking, chronic pain can be split into two categories, inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system and a systematic review of epidemiological studies estimates the prevalence of neuropathic pain to be 6.9–10%. The need for novel therapies to treat neuropathic pain is demonstrated by the analysis of analgesia success. A 2006 report on chronic pain in Europe identified that 64% of those taking prescription medicine found that their pain medication was at times inadequate, and of the 48% of chronic pain sufferers not taking pain medication, 14% had stopped due to side effects. To develop new treatments for neuropathic pain, it is important to first understand the circuitry of pain: how is pain triggered and how is that information transmitted to the central nervous system? To do this, it is necessary to understand how nociceptors function.

### Can pain or hyperalgesia Be a classically conditioned response in humans? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1131PfSk]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical scenarios of repeated pain usually involve both nociceptive and non-nociceptive input. It is likely that associations between these stimuli are learned over time. Such learning may underlie subsequent amplification of pain, or evocation of pain in the absence of nociception.

Methods

We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the evidence that allodynia or hyperalgesia can be a classically conditioned response. A sensitive search of the literature covered Medline, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, PubMed, Scopus, PsycArticles, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. Additional studies were identified by contacting experts and searching published reviews. Two reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion, evaluated risk of bias, and extracted data. Studies were included if they aimed to elicit or amplify pain using a classical conditioning procedure in healthy, adult humans. Studies were excluded if they did not distinguish between classical conditioning and explicit verbal suggestion as learning sources, or did not use experiential learning.

Results

Thirteen studies, with varying risk of bias, were included. Ten studies evaluated classically conditioned hyperalgesia: nine found hyperalgesia; one did not. Pooled effects (n = 8 with full data) showed a significant pain increase after conditioning (mean difference of 7.40 [95%CI: 4.00–10.80] on a 0–100 pain scale). Three studies evaluated conditioned allodynia and found conflicting results.

Conclusion

The existing literature suggests that classical conditioning can amplify pain. No conclusions can be drawn about whether or not classical conditioning can elicit pain. Rigorous experimental conditioning studies with nociceptive unconditioned stimuli are needed to fill this gap in knowledge.

### We do not need a third mechanistic descriptor for chronic pain states! not yet [^112iJdTm]. Pain (2017). Low credibility.

At the core of the proposal is the concept "altered nociceptive function", which, the authors do not describe more precisely. This is a critical weakness of the article because the whole argument for a new terminology rests on this concept. Which specific aspect of nociceptive function is altered in the patients the authors use as examples? Evidence of altered peripheral mechanisms is lacking or circumstantial regarding the pain conditions targeted by the new terminology (eg, fibromyalgia), and it seems that the authors favor that the altered nociception is of central origin. It is not obvious, however, that this helps to distinguish one case of chronic pain from another, and it certainly does not help to explain the pain experienced in medically unexplained pain conditions. In virtually all cases of persistent pain, regardless of cause, central changes (networks, gray matter reduction) have been reported. The problem is that these changes help very little to explain why the pain arises; they are so far just structural correlates of persistent pain. Indeed, Kosek et al claim in their discussion that the terms dysfunctional pain and pathological pain "not only give no insight into possible mechanisms but also carry implications that may stigmatize patients". Yet, why should an ill-defined concept of altered nociceptive function be any better? (The authors also claim that, without any references, "patients suffering from altered nociceptive function typically respond better to centrally than peripherally targeted therapies".)

### The neurobiology of nociceptive and anti-nociceptive systems [^116wupFt]. Pain Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Pain is both a sensory event of the peripheral and central nervous systems and an experience that arises from, and reciprocally can affect processes of higher consciousness. Alterations in peripheral and central neuraxes can lead to sensitization, structural modification and long-term potentiation that can overcome modulatory influence(s) and change the non-linear adaptability of these systems to a progressively linear, pathologic state with a diverse constellation of clinical signs and symptoms. Recent progress in molecular biology, neurochemistry and neuroanatomy has led to significant advancement in understanding the interactive roles of these heterogeneous systems in mediating and modulating various types of pain. This review concisely provides an overview of the structure and function of these substrates. As we reach the midpoint in a decade marked by pain control and research, such knowledge is critical to further both a more comprehensive appreciation of the phenomenon that is pain, and the development of therapeutic interventions that are innovative and effective.

### Nociceptor sensitization in pain pathogenesis [^115Mm8Mc]. Nature Medicine (2010). Excellent credibility.

The incidence of chronic pain is estimated to be 20–25% worldwide. Few patients with chronic pain obtain complete relief from the drugs that are currently available, and more than half report inadequate relief. Underlying the challenge of developing better drugs to manage chronic pain is incomplete understanding of the heterogeneity of mechanisms that contribute to the transition from acute tissue insult to chronic pain and to pain conditions for which the underlying pathology is not apparent. An intact central nervous system (CNS) is required for the conscious perception of pain, and changes in the CNS are clearly evident in chronic pain states. However, the blockage of nociceptive input into the CNS can effectively relieve or markedly attenuate discomfort and pain, revealing the importance of ongoing peripheral input to the maintenance of chronic pain. Accordingly, we focus here on nociceptors: their excitability, their heterogeneity and their role in initiating and maintaining pain.

### Advances in understanding nociception and neuropathic pain [^111R8Skz]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Pain results from the activation of a subset of sensory neurones termed nociceptors and has evolved as a "detect and protect" mechanism. However, lesion or disease in the sensory system can result in neuropathic pain, which serves no protective function. Understanding how the sensory nervous system works and what changes occur in neuropathic pain are vital in identifying new therapeutic targets and developing novel analgesics. In recent years, technologies such as optogenetics and RNA-sequencing have been developed, which alongside the more traditional use of animal neuropathic pain models and insights from genetic variations in humans have enabled significant advances to be made in the mechanistic understanding of neuropathic pain.

### Unusual pain disorders-what can Be learned from them? [^114f83As]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pain arises from a complex interplay between peripheral processes and central circuits with interactions between sensory and affective CNS pathways. A broad classification of different pain states exists where nociceptive pain arises from chemical activation of peripheral nociceptors, neuropathic pain from a lesion or disease to somatosensory nervous system leading to abnormal electrical events in neurons and nociplastic pain occurring where there is no obvious peripheral drive. Complications to this schema are mixed nociceptive and neuropathic pains such as seen in some low back pain and some cancer pain patients and neuropathic components to the pain in some patients with osteoarthritis, an archetypical nociceptive pain.

Quantitative sensory testing (QST), both as a research tool and for bedside characterisation of patients as well as a number of questionnaires have produced detailed descriptions of the sensory phenotypes of patients with neuropathic pain. Much less has been reported for other pain states. Importantly, where sensory phenotypes have been studied, it is clear that in neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia (FM) and persistent post-surgical pain, not all patients are the same, and several subgroups have been described. This leads to the idea that the subgroups are likely to have different underlying pain mechanisms and so may not respond to the same therapies. There is clinical and preclinical evidence to support this premise.

There are a number of much less common pain conditions and although rare, may shed light on pain mechanisms that could be prevalent in other patients. In this account, we shine a light on the characteristics of a number of patients with pain from uncommon conditions where the pain may result from peripheral, spinal or central alterations.

We have compiled several examples of uncommon pain disorders based on two selection criteria. First, a deeper understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms was recently unravelled which led to the development of more refined diagnostic procedures and hypotheses for therapeutical targets. Second, and even more importantly, novel causative treatment options have been discovered in recent years which have the potential to extend the life expectancy of patients significantly.

### The concept of nociplastic pain-where to from here? [^111rmTk4]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Nociplastic pain, a third mechanistic pain descriptor in addition to nociceptive and neuropathic pain, was adopted in 2017 by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP). It is defined as "pain that arises from altered nociception" not fully explained by nociceptive or neuropathic pain mechanisms. Peripheral and/or central sensitization, manifesting as allodynia and hyperalgesia, is typically present, although not specific for nociplastic pain. Criteria for possible nociplastic pain manifesting in the musculoskeletal system define a minimum of 4 conditions: (1) pain duration of more than 3 months; (2) regional, multifocal or widespread rather than discrete distribution of pain; (3) pain cannot entirely be explained by nociceptive or neuropathic mechanisms; and (4) clinical signs of pain hypersensitivity present in the region of pain. Educational endeavors and field testing of criteria are needed. Pharmacological treatment guidelines, based on the three pain types, need to be developed. Currently pharmacological treatments of nociplastic pain resemble those of neuropathic; however, opioids should be avoided. A major challenge is to unravel pathophysiological mechanisms driving altered nociception in patients suffering from nociplastic pain. Examples from fibromyalgia would include pathophysiology of the peripheral as well as central nervous system, such as autoreactive antibodies acting at the level of the dorsal root ganglia and aberrant cerebral pain processing, including altered brain network architecture. Understanding pathophysiological mechanisms and their interactions is a prerequisite for the development of diagnostic tests allowing for individualized treatments and development of new strategies for prevention and treatment.

### An overview of pathways encoding nociception [^114cyunx]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

The nervous system detects and interprets a variety of chemical, mechanical, and thermal stimuli. In the face of tissue injury, local inflammatory products perpetuate ongoing activity and sensitisation of the peripheral nerve termini. This ongoing activity evokes a state of robust spinal facilitation mediated by a number of local circuits, the net effect yielding an enhanced message of nociception to higher centres. This messaging typically wanes with the resolution of inflammation or wound healing. However, there are situations in which peripheral and central components of the pain transmission pathway extend and enhance the pain state, leading to a persistent hypersensitivity, e.g., an acute to chronic pain transition. Current work points to the contribution of innate and adaptive immunity in creating these enduring conditions. We briefly describe the underlying biological components of both physiological pain processing and pathological pain processing, as well as the acute to chronic pain transition and the role of innate and adaptive immunity in this transition.

### The descending modulation of pain [^112c76JA]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The brain modulates pain perception through descending pathways that exert bidirectional control over nociceptive inputs and spinal neuronal activity. Whether modulation is facilitatory or inhibitory depends on the coordinated output of the descending pain modulatory system (DPMS), comprising functionally distinct circuits that influence one another. Here, we outline the foundation studies informing our current understanding of mechanisms underpinning the descending modulation of pain. We indicate bold new approaches delivering novel insights regarding somatosensory processing and outline how, in the context of identifying and manipulating functionally relevant pathways encompassed by the DPMS, we can improve knowledge, and treatment, of pain.

### Different types of pain in complex regional pain syndrome require a personalized treatment strategy [^113WF6BT]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Pain experienced by CRPS patients should be differentiated between nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic pain to optimize the management of CRPS. Pain should be seen as a continuum in which nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic pain can shift over the course of the syndrome due to a change in underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of CRPS. Precision medicine―by subgrouping CRPS patients based on history taking, physical examination, and diagnostic testing on the most prominent pain type―may tailor a more specific and effective treatment for individual CRPS patients.

### Painful truth: the need to Re-center chronic pain on the functional role of pain [^114SiBr5]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The simplest notion of pain is considered to result from nociception, which "begins when energy that produces or threatens to produce imminent injury (a noxious stimulus) is transduced into neural activity, leading to organized responses that defend the tissue under threat and aid in its repair". Yet, pain also manifests in a more complex manner once injury has occurred; this is inflammatory pain. Inflammatory pain is also considered to be adaptive, as it helps with healingby internally signaling the cascade of molecular healing mechanisms, mobilizing the individual to take care of the injury and allowing for social efforts to promote survival. Although nociception may have initiated this pain, the inflammatory process transforms the pain experience beyond nociceptive pain via neuroplastic changesand includes features like hyperalgesia and allodynia (see Table 1). These manifestations reflect pain in and around the injured area (hyperalgesia) or pain sensitivity to usually non-painful stimuli (allodynia), which go beyond a direct proportional effect of injury, reflecting the nervous system's ability to modify bodily perceptions in response to injury. This, too, is a normal response expected to end once healing has occurred. Pain that persists beyond presumed healing time, on the other hand, is considered maladaptive or pathological pain.

The Problem of Chronic Pain

Persistent or chronic pain is of specific clinical concern given assumptions of its maladaptive nature. Attempts to define chronic pain continue to rest on duration of symptoms beyond normal tissue healing, under the assumption that 3 monthsis the adequate healing time. Pain experienced after this period is considered to have outlasted its functional purpose and assumed to reflect pathological states (Figure 2A). Although this approach is a useful start to establish taxonomic practice and promote research in light of incomplete knowledge, it has its limitations. In validly refining the construct of pathological pain, two main issues remain. First, it is not evident that 3 months is adequate time for healing for all conditions; therefore, some conditions classified as chronic pain may, in truth, be acute pain or subacute pain maintained by ongoing noxious stimuli (ie, functional pain) rather than pathological chronic pain (Figure 2B). For example, it is reasonable to assume that repetitive strain injuries, may not heal fully if the precipitating activities are ongoing, and stress fracturesor injured ligamentsmay take longer than 3 months to fully heal or for normal activity to resume.

### Central mechanisms of pathological pain [^114HDY71]. Nature Medicine (2010). Excellent credibility.

Chronic pain is a major challenge to clinical practice and basic science. The peripheral and central neural networks that mediate nociception show extensive plasticity in pathological disease states. Disease-induced plasticity can occur at both structural and functional levels and is manifest as changes in individual molecules, synapses, cellular function and network activity. Recent work has yielded a better understanding of communication within the neural matrix of physiological pain and has also brought important advances in concepts of injury-induced hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia and how these might contribute to the complex, multidimensional state of chronic pain. This review focuses on the molecular determinants of network plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS) and discusses their relevance to the development of new therapeutic approaches.

### Normal and abnormal coding of somatosensory stimuli causing pain [^1139SRuw]. Nature Neuroscience (2014). Medium credibility.

Noxious stimuli usually cause pain and pain usually arises from noxious stimuli, but exceptions to these apparent truisms are the basis for clinically important problems and provide valuable insight into the neural code for pain. In this Review, we discuss how painful sensations arise. We argue that, although primary somatosensory afferents are tuned to specific stimulus features, natural stimuli often activate more than one type of afferent. Manipulating coactivation patterns can alter perception in ways that argue against each type of afferent acting independently (as expected for strictly labeled lines), suggesting instead that signals conveyed by different types of afferents interact. Deciphering the central circuits that mediate those interactions is critical for explaining the generation and modulation of neural signals that ultimately elicit pain. The advent of genetic and optical dissection techniques promise to dramatically accelerate progress toward this goal, which will facilitate the rational design of future pain therapeutics.

### Spinal pain: current understanding, trends, and the future of care [^114a4DHM]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

The multidimensional nature of pain

The International Association for the Study of Pain defines pain as "an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage". Therefore, the concept of pain can be complex and difficult to grasp. As a multifaceted phenomenon, pain requires a versatile approach to care, with a view to achieve the best possible outcomes. Nonmalignant spinal pain, particularly persistent pain, is no different and should be considered under the umbrella of the pain conundrum. Unraveling the puzzle of pain starts with each person who has persistent pain becoming aware of the interlinking contribution of injury pain (thought of as nociception), neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, and increasingly, the likelihood of immunoreactive component(s). The emphasis here is that pain is complex and requires a likewise multifaceted approach to care. We feel that a patient-specific approach drawing upon the expertise of multiple health care disciplines is emerging as the best practice approach.

### Painful truth: the need to Re-center chronic pain on the functional role of pain [^112gng2W]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Reducing What Gets Lost in Translation

Given the rapid increase in research output globallyand advances in technology, genetics and neuroscience, navigating existing knowledge to identify consistencies and decide on research priorities is difficult and susceptible to error. It is therefore critical that the functional role of pain be central to the translational research endeavor to reduce misclassification of constructs limiting advancements.

In particular, the models of pain used in research should be appropriate for the given research questions and should consider whether they reflect functional and/or pathological pain. The strengths and limitations of animal models of pain have been debated, but these debates show that animal research has been critical in helping uncover what we know about the neurobiology of pain. However, although efforts are made to model behavioral, emotional and psychological aspects of the pain experience, animal models largely rely on a construct that is only a partial representation of pain — nociception, and all of them rely on some noxious insult whether mechanical, chemical or surgical. Advances have been made which include non-inflammatory pain models of muscle pain. However, these models are also predicated on noxious stimulation of the muscle tissues bringing into question their interpretation as a model for unexplained pathological pain. Meaning, since there is introduction of a noxious stimulus, this may be, by definition, inducing functional pain rather than the intended pathological pain. Therefore, reconsidering the functional role of pain may help to clarify what the models represent, how to improve them or the experiments that employ them, and/or promote better interpretation to bridge gaps where models are limited.

### Adieu to an aphorism: why nociception is necessary for pain [^112LcDgK]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

An aphorism is a short saying intended to express a general truth. In this paper, the popular aphorism, "nociception is neither necessary nor sufficient for pain", is critically examined. While the latter part of that aphorism, that nociception is not always associated with pain, is not controversial, the former part, that pain can occur without nociception, poses a major challenge to scientific and clinical understanding. This article traces the origins of this part of the aphorism in the pain-related literature and the empirical evidence upon which it is based. The assertion that nociception is not necessary for pain is found to contradict the definition of pain itself. Furthermore, the observational and experimental evidence drawn upon to support that assertion does not withstand critical examination. It is shown that the assertion that nociception is not necessary for pain is untenable on both logical and biological grounds. It is argued therefore that the aphorism should be discarded in favour of "nociception is necessary but not sufficient for pain. The conceptual, scientific and clinical implications of this signal change in principle are discussed.

### Discovery and validation of biomarkers to aid the development of safe and effective pain therapeutics: challenges and opportunities [^117LC6zi]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

Pain can be conceptualized as a conscious interpretation of a sensory stimulus that activates nociceptive afferents and the mental projection of that stimulus onto a body part. Often, the stimulus–pain relationship can be weak, distorted or absent, such as in many chronic pain conditions. Pain assessment is the process of approximating a person's self-narrative or ground truth, and pain biomarkers can aid this effort. In addition to representing pain intensity, biomarkers can identify the factors that predict treatment outcomes. The general consensus among the authors of this paper is that there is a substantial unmet need for better biomarkers to facilitate the development of non-addictive pain therapeutics for the following reasons. First, biomarkers can provide an indication, either directly or indirectly, that a therapeutic intervention reached its intended molecular target. Second, biomarkers can predict the response to a therapeutic. Third, biomarkers can improve the quality of a clinical design by allowing the stratification of patients into specific subcategories of a disease or condition. Last, biomarkers can be used to monitor safety and efficacy over time. In addition, we agree that biomarkers, signatures and clinical end points have the potential to transform the medical landscape by introducing pain diagnostic tools that are precise, fast and adaptive to an individual's state, hence radically changing how pain is managed, monitored and treated on an individual basis. Machine learning techniques can rapidly interpret patterns in reams of data, and thus identify key information that healthcare providers cannot resolve in a brief patient visit at the point of care. The addition of biomarkers with a mechanistic relationship to the pain may lead to novel non-addictive therapeutics.

### Integrating mechanistic-based and classification-based concepts into perioperative pain management: an educational guide for acute pain physicians [^114fKP9x]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain begins with acute pain. Physicians tend to classify pain by duration (acute vs chronic) and mechanism (nociceptive, neuropathic and nociplastic). Although this taxonomy may facilitate diagnosis and documentation, such categories are to some degree arbitrary constructs, with significant overlap in terms of mechanisms and treatments. In clinical practice, there are myriad different definitions for chronic pain and a substantial portion of chronic pain involves mixed phenotypes. Classification of pain based on acuity and mechanisms informs management at all levels and constitutes a critical part of guidelines and treatment for chronic pain care. Yet specialty care is often siloed, with advances in understanding lagging years behind in some areas in which these developments should be at the forefront of clinical practice. For example, in perioperative pain management, enhanced recovery protocols are not standardized and tend to drive treatment without consideration of mechanisms, which in many cases may be incongruent with personalized medicine and mechanism-based treatment. In this educational document, we discuss mechanisms and classification of pain as it pertains to commonly performed surgical procedures. Our goal is to provide a clinical reference for the acute pain physician to facilitate pain management decision-making (both diagnosis and therapy) in the perioperative period.

### Neuropathic pain: mechanisms and their clinical implications [^114ZA4DH]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Neuropathic pain can develop after nerve injury, when deleterious changes occur in injured neurons and along nociceptive and descending modulatory pathways in the central nervous system. The myriad neurotransmitters and other substances involved in the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain also play a part in other neurobiological disorders. This might partly explain the high comorbidity rates for chronic pain, sleep disorders, and psychological conditions such as depression, and why drugs that are effective for one condition may benefit others. Neuropathic pain can be distinguished from non-neuropathic pain by two factors. Firstly, in neuropathic pain there is no transduction (conversion of a nociceptive stimulus into an electrical impulse). Secondly, the prognosis is worse: injury to major nerves is more likely than injury to non-nervous tissue to result in chronic pain. In addition, neuropathic pain tends to be more refractory than non-neuropathic pain to conventional analgesics, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids. However, because of the considerable overlap between neuropathic and nociceptive pain in terms of mechanisms and treatment modalities, it might be more constructive to view these entities as different points on the same continuum. This review focuses on the mechanisms of neuropathic pain, with special emphasis on clinical implications.

### Pathophysiology of pain: a practical primer [^114zLsdc]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Summary

The experience of pain is a subjective one and more than a simple sensation. Pain is commonly defined as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience due to actual or potential tissue damage or described in such terms. Pain may be broadly classified into physiological and pathological pain. Nociceptive and inflammatory pains are physiological pain states, as they are protective and adaptive, whereas pathological pain is nonprotective and maladaptive. Nociception is the result of suprathreshold stimulation of peripheral nociceptors. Inflammatory pain follows release of various chemical mediators after tissue injury including surgery leading to peripheral sensitization. Nociceptive input is then transmitted to the spinal cord via primary afferents. Modulation of the nociceptive input occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, influenced by descending inhibitory systems. Central sensitization is a neuromodulatory change that results in the development of secondary hyperalgesia. The modulated nociceptive input then travels up the ascending tracts, mainly via the spinothalamic tract to the thalamus and subsequently to the higher centers of the brain. Pathological pain such as neuropathic pain and central nervous system dysfunctional pain are the result of neuroplasticity of the peripheral and central nervous system. Abnormal ectopic firing of neurons in the absence of a stimulus, increased neuronal hypersensitivity, changes within ion channels, and even alteration in gene expression and changes in the cortical representation are involved in the pathogenesis of these pain states. The development of persistent postsurgical pain is an example for this complex process.

### Transient receptor potential channels: targeting pain at the source [^114zCQkH]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2009). Medium credibility.

Pain results from the complex processing of neural signals at different levels of the central nervous system, with each signal potentially offering multiple opportunities for pharmacological intervention. A logical strategy for developing novel analgesics is to target the beginning of the pain pathway, and aim potential treatments directly at the nociceptors — the high-threshold primary sensory neurons that detect noxious stimuli. The largest group of receptors that function as noxious stimuli detectors in nociceptors is the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family. This Review highlights evidence supporting particular TRP channels as targets for analgesics, indicates the likely efficacy profiles of TRP-channel-acting drugs, and discusses the development pathways needed to test candidates as analgesics in humans.

### Neuropathic pain: redefinition and a grading system for clinical and research purposes [^116RQd13]. Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Pain usually results from activation of nociceptive afferents by actually or potentially tissue-damaging stimuli. Pain may also arise by activity generated within the nervous system without adequate stimulation of its peripheral sensory endings. For this type of pain, the International Association for the Study of Pain introduced the term neuropathic pain, defined as "pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction in the nervous system". While this definition has been useful in distinguishing some characteristics of neuropathic and nociceptive types of pain, it lacks defined boundaries. Since the sensitivity of the nociceptive system is modulated by its adequate activation (e.g., by central sensitization), it has been difficult to distinguish neuropathic dysfunction from physiologic neuroplasticity. We present a more precise definition developed by a group of experts from the neurologic and pain community: pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system. This revised definition fits into the nosology of neurologic disorders. The reference to the somatosensory system was derived from a wide range of neuropathic pain conditions ranging from painful neuropathy to central poststroke pain. Because of the lack of a specific diagnostic tool for neuropathic pain, a grading system of definite, probable, and possible neuropathic pain is proposed. The grade possible can only be regarded as a working hypothesis, which does not exclude but does not diagnose neuropathic pain. The grades probable and definite require confirmatory evidence from a neurologic examination. This grading system is proposed for clinical and research purposes.

### Advances in understanding nociception and neuropathic pain [^112izMz9]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Nociceptors: transducers of pain

The human body is equipped with different types of sensory neurones and nociceptors are the subset that function as the primary unit of pain, being equipped with receptors and ion channels that enable the detection of stimuli that have potential to cause damage. When a noxious stimulus activates an ion channel on a nociceptor, for example proton activation of acid-sensing ion channels (ASIC), cation influx depolarises the nociceptor producing a receptor potential. If the receptor potential is of sufficient magnitude to reach the activation threshold for voltage-gated Na + channels (NaV), it will trigger action potential generation and transmission of a pain signal to the spinal cord. In recent years, many new techniques have been developed in pre-clinical research that have accelerated our progress in understanding how nociceptors work and provide tantalising glimpses at their clinical utility. Indeed, such work is essential for both identifying potential new painkiller targets and the developing novel biological treatments for neuropathic pain.

### Pain versus suffering: a distinction currently without a difference [^111AkAzU]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2019). Medium credibility.

My paper challenges an influential distinction between pain and suffering put forward by physician-ethicist, Eric Cassell. I argue that Cassell's distinction is philosophically untenable because he contrasts suffering with an outdated theory of pain. In particular, Cassell focuses on one type of pain, the interpretation of nociception induced by noxious stimuli such as heat or sharp objects; yet since the late 1970s, pain scientists have rendered both nociception and noxious stimuli unnecessary for pain. I argue that this discrepancy between Cassell's distinction and pain science produces three philosophical problems for his distinction: first, he frames his distinction too generally, concentrating on only one type of pain (interpreted nociception) to the neglect of others, such as neuropathy; second, it is possible that Cassell's understanding of pain may include suffering; and third, Cassell gives examples of pain and suffering manifesting independently of each other, but it is possible that these cases may instead exemplify differences between nociceptive and non-nociceptive types of pain. Due to these problems, I conclude that Cassell's distinction currently lacks a difference. I call for new efforts to articulate the differences, if any, between pain and suffering.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^111ZrfK7]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Pain physiology — pain involves both sensation and response, beginning with activation of nociceptors and transmission via second-order pain neurons to the brain stem and cortex, with descending modulation from the cortex to the spinal cord. Perception integrates the modulated pain signal with sensory and cognitive inputs, and identical stimuli can elicit exaggerated or diminished responses based on context; patient reported self-efficacy is a better predictor of satisfaction with pain management than the nociceptive stimulus itself. Pain perception is dynamic, with continued pain producing neural changes that amplify or diminish sensation; in the spinal cord, continued pain can lead to up-regulation of receptors and an amplified response to repeated stimuli, a phenomenon thought to be important in the transition from acute pain to chronic pain. Chronic pain is continued perception of pain without an obvious or ongoing anatomic trigger; development of chronic pain is common after trauma and can lead to significant long-term functional impairment and potentially a substance use disorder. Because pain is a multidimensional emotional and sensory experience, a patient's response can vary widely based on physiologic, psychologic, and contextual factors.

### Mechanisms of disease: neuropathic pain – a clinical perspective [^112iDoAG]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

Neuropathic pain syndromes-pain after a lesion or disease of the peripheral or central nervous system-are clinically characterized by spontaneous and evoked types of pain, which are underpinned by various distinct pathophysiological mechanisms in the peripheral and central nervous systems. In some patients, the nerve lesion triggers molecular changes in nociceptive neurons, which become abnormally sensitive and develop pathological spontaneous activity. Inflammatory reactions of the damaged nerve trunk can induce ectopic nociceptor activity, causing spontaneous pain. The hyperactivity in nociceptors induces secondary changes in processing neurons in the spinal cord and brain, so that input from mechanoreceptive A-fibers is perceived as pain. Neuroplastic changes in the central pain modulatory systems can lead to further hyperexcitability. The treatment of neuropathic pain is still unsatisfactory, and a new hypothetical concept has been proposed, in which pain is analyzed on the basis of underlying mechanisms. The increased knowledge of pain-generating mechanisms and their translation into symptoms and signs might eventually allow a dissection of the mechanisms that operate in each patient. If a precise clinical phenotypic characterization of the neuropathic pain is combined with a selection of drugs that act on those mechanisms, it should ultimately be possible to design optimal treatments for individuals. This review discusses the conceptual framework of the novel mechanism-based classification, encouraging the reader to see neuropathic pain as a clinical entity rather than a compilation of single disease states.

### A new way of thinking about pains [^1114gHdd]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The traditional construct of acute pain vs chronic pain is arbitrary and obscures fundamental differences in clinical pain phenomena. A more powerful dichotomy between peripherally generated pain and centrally maintained pains can facilitate advances in both pain research and clinical care. We should abandon the temporally based pain classification scheme because it does not accurately reflect the underlying principles inherent in the phenomena of pain.

### Pathophysiology of pain and mechanisms of neuromodulation: a narrative review (A neuron project) [^116HsSpz]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Pain serves as a vital innate defense mechanism that can significantly impact an individual's quality of life. Understanding the physiological effects of pain well plays an important role in developing novel pain treatments. Nociceptor neurons play a key role in pain and inflammation. Interactions between nociceptors and the immune system occur both at the site of injury and within the central nervous system. Modulating chemical mediators and nociceptor activity offers promising new approaches to pain management. Essentially, the sensory nervous system is essential for modulating the body's protective response, making it critical to understand these interactions to discover new pain treatment strategies. New innovations in neuromodulation have led to alternatives to opioids individuals with chronic pain with consequent improvement in disease-based treatment and nerve targeting. New neural targets from cellular and structural perspectives have revolutionized the field of neuromodulation. This narrative review aims to elucidate the mechanisms of pain transmission and processing, examine the characteristics and properties of nociceptors, and explore how the immune system influences pain perception. It further provides an updated overview of the physiology of pain and neuromodulatory mechanisms essential for managing acute and chronic pain. We assess the current understanding of different pain types, focusing on key molecules involved in each type and their physiological effects. Additionally, we compare painful and painless neuropathies and discuss the neuroimmune interactions involved in pain manifestation.

### Evidence and consensus recommendations for the pharmacological management of pain in India [^1118Bd2n]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Pathophysiology of pain

Regardless of its categorization, pain cannot be distinctly attributed to any isolated pathological event. Pain experience is a complex process that involves the activation of multiple neuronal signaling pathways within the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS). The subjective experience of pain may be summarized as a four-stage process - transduction, transmission, modulation and perception. In stage 1 (transduction), nociceptive stimuli of tissue-damaging potential (including mechanical, chemical and thermal stimuli) are converted by the sensory cells into action potentials. Stage 2 (transmission) involves the conduction of these action potentials along afferent neurons to the DH of the spinal cord. In stage 3 (modulation), coding of nociceptive information occurs at the level of spinal DH. Modulation at the DH can be excitatory or inhibitory, thereby increasing or decreasing the resulting pain. Stage 4 involves generation of autonomic, affective, cognitive and behavioral responses to the painful stimulus, leading to pain perception.

### Deconstructing the neuropathic pain phenotype to reveal neural mechanisms [^114Ldkv3]. Neuron (2012). Low credibility.

After nerve injury maladaptive changes can occur in injured sensory neurons and along the entire nociceptive pathway within the CNS, which may lead to spontaneous pain or pain hypersensitivity. The resulting neuropathic pain syndromes present as a complex combination of negative and positive symptoms, which vary enormously from individual to individual. This variation depends on a diversity of underlying pathophysiological changes resulting from the convergence of etiological, genotypic, and environmental factors. The pain phenotype can serve therefore, as a window on underlying pathophysiological neural mechanisms and as a guide for developing personalized pain medicine.

### Pathophysiology of pain and mechanisms of neuromodulation: a narrative review (A neuron project) [^116JLia8]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Various forms of pain arise from different sources: 1. Physiologic pain arises from surface irritation caused by noxious stimuli on skin receptors. 2. Inflammatory pain emerges as a response to tissue injury or subsequent tissue reactions. 3. Neuropathic pain results from a primary dysfunction within the peripheral or central nervous system. 4. Dysfunctional pain stems from malfunctions within the somatosensory system itself, lacking identifiable noxious stimuli.

The development of these stimuli arises from the response of these nerve fibers, triggering the activation of ion channels/receptors or the release of neurotransmitters. Inflammatory mediators are released following injury and inflammation. Consequently, these mediators interact with specific receptors in primary nociceptive neurons.

The heightened activity in nociceptors leads to the opening of ion channels and receptors, prompting the release of neurotransmitters from central terminals within the spinal cord. This process results in central sensitization (secondary hyperalgesia and allodynia). Abnormal expression of receptors and ion channels during chronic pathophysiological states contributes to atypical pain signaling, resulting in persistent pain. Understanding the molecular mechanisms behind these events targets the modulation or altered functions of nociceptors due to inflammation or injury.

### We do not need a third mechanistic descriptor for chronic pain states! not yet [^113vbNmE]. Pain (2017). Low credibility.

Letter To Editor:

Kosek et alshould be commended for attacking the difficult task of improving terminology of persistent pain conditions with no clear medical explanation and for their invitation to debate their proposal. Unfortunately, their proposal will not move the field forward. The main reason is that the new terminology is so imprecise and vague that it can aid neither clinical thinking nor research. By the end of their topical review, Kosek et al state, "as our knowledge of pain mechanisms advances, so should pain terminology change". While this statement may seem self-evident, even "pain terminology" lacks precision, and the authors do little to specify what exactly they mean. For example, does the phrase pain terminology refer to the phenomenal aspects of pain, to physiologic mechanisms that may lead to pain, to various challenges that can provoke pain, or to the meaning of pain in an evolutionary or personal context?

It may be pertinent to remind ourselves of what pain is and what it is not. Pain is a feeling experienced by a person, and although a functioning brain is necessary, the pain is not "in the person's brain", nor in his or her peripheral nerves or spinal cord. Pain may be evoked by a multitude of bodily and mental challenges. Although often temporarily associated with the feeling of pain, nociceptor activity or activity in pathways and cortical networks are not pain. Thus, nociceptor activation does not necessarily evoke pain, whereas paradoxically loss of signals from low-threshold mechanoreceptors may cause pain. Finally, mere expectations may evoke pain, without any nociceptor activation involved. When new clinical terminology is introduced, one expects it to serve a purpose, either in a clinical setting or in research. The proposed descriptor is, however, nothing more than a rather trivial clinical observation (ie, chronic pain patients with pain of unknown etiology displaying findings on a neurological examination regarding sensibility).

### Different types of pain in complex regional pain syndrome require a personalized treatment strategy [^112Wp6UJ]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Hence, the aim of this narrative review is threefold: 1) to describe the types of pain in CRPS and link these pain types to pathophysiological underlying mechanisms in CRPS; 2) to explain how these pain types can be differentiated by history taking, physical examination, and diagnostic tests; 3) to illustrate how these pain types can be specifically targeted to optimize treatment effectiveness. Ultimately, a personalized treatment plan should be made for each CRPS patient. For this purpose, the differentiation of symptom pain in nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic pain may be an additional helpful tool to optimize the management of CRPS.

### Contemporary management of pain in cirrhosis: toward precision therapy for pain [^1177qQW6]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

NOCICEPTIVE PAIN

Epidemiology

Nociceptive pain is the most well‐understood type of pain, arising from actual or threatened tissue damage. This is pain that occurs as a result of nociceptor activation in a normal sensory nervous system. Although nociceptive pain may play a role in the development of chronic pain, this type of pain is more likely to be acute, resolving when the injury heals and inflammation decreases. In patients with cirrhosis, nociceptive pain can result from diverse causes, including pathologic fractures, ascites, splenomegaly, muscle cramps, musculoskeletal disease (e.g. avascular necrosis, cellulitis, septic arthritis, spondylodiscitis), and mastalgia, for instance. Whereas the overall prevalence of nociceptive pain in cirrhosis is not known, the high rate of opioid prescription, suggests that a substantial proportion of these individuals are at least thought to be experiencing nociceptive pain.

Diagnosis

Generally, somatic nociceptive pain is well‐localized, reproducible, and proportional to the injury. Visceral nociceptive pain, conversely, may be diffuse, with referred pain to superficial areas, and can be associated with autonomic symptoms (e.g. sweating, heart rate changes, nausea). Pain descriptors with high specificity for nociceptive pain include heavy, stinging, lacerating, and suffocating. Although diagnosis is not always straightforward, given that pain may be mixed (i.e. with nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic components), definitive physical examination or testing (e.g. imaging) can reveal a pain source that is amenable to treatment.

### Applying modern pain neuroscience in clinical practice: criteria for the classification of central sensitization pain [^114FvkMM]. Pain Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The awareness is growing that central sensitization is of prime importance for the assessment and management of chronic pain, but its classification is challenging clinically since no gold standard method of assessment exists.

Objectives

Designing the first set of classification criteria for the classification of central sensitization pain.

Methods

A body of evidence from original research papers was used by 18 pain experts from 7 different countries to design the first classification criteria for central sensitization pain.

Results

It is proposed that the classification of central sensitization pain entails 2 major steps: the exclusion of neuropathic pain and the differential classification of nociceptive versus central sensitization pain. For the former, the International Association for the Study of Pain diagnostic criteria are available for diagnosing or excluding neuropathic pain. For the latter, clinicians are advised to screen their patients for 3 major classification criteria, and use them to complete the classification algorithm for each individual patient with chronic pain. The first and obligatory criterion entails disproportionate pain, implying that the severity of pain and related reported or perceived disability are disproportionate to the nature and extent of injury or pathology (i.e., tissue damage or structural impairments). The 2 remaining criteria are 1) the presence of diffuse pain distribution, allodynia, and hyperalgesia; and 2) hypersensitivity of senses unrelated to the musculoskeletal system (defined as a score of at least 40 on the Central Sensitization Inventory).

Limitations

Although based on direct and indirect research findings, the classification algorithm requires experimental testing in future studies.

Conclusion

Clinicians can use the proposed classification algorithm for differentiating neuropathic, nociceptive, and central sensitization pain.

HIVMA/IDSA chronic pain guideline — types of pain and management scope — chronic pain is defined as pain that lasts longer than 3–6 months and persists beyond the usual period of tissue repair. For inflammatory pain it will typically respond to inhibition of inflammation with steroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, while other injuries respond to analgesic medications such as acetaminophen and to opioids that diminish the affective response to nociception. The guideline emphasizes that management is directed at promoting well-being and engaging PLWH in treatments and rehabilitation interventions, notes large limitations in the literature for PLWH, and specifies that persons living with HIV and malignant pain should be managed according to cancer pain guidelines.

### Neuropathic pain: an updated grading system for research and clinical practice [^114KbbEB]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

1. Introduction

In 1994, the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) defined neuropathic pain as "pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction in the nervous system". In 2008, a task force initiated by the IASP Special Interest Group on Neuropathic Pain (NeuPSIG) noted the need to distinguish neuropathic pain from nociceptive pain arising indirectly from neurological disorders and pain conditions with secondary neuroplastic changes occurring in the nociceptive system, and proposed a new definition that omitted the term "dysfunction": "pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system". A slightly modified version of this definition was proposed by the IASP Taxonomy Committee and accepted by the IASP: "pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system". The omission of the term "dysfunction" excludes conditions involving ill-defined changes in the nervous system and conditions with no known lesion of the somatosensory nervous system from being classified as neuropathic pain. The restriction to the somatosensory nervous system is important because conditions such as musculoskeletal pain (eg, due to spasticity) arising indirectly from disorders of the motor system should not be confused with neuropathic pain. The term "primary" was omitted because of the difficulty in distinguishing between primary and secondary causes of neuropathic pain; however, the omission means that nociceptive pain conditions that — over time — may cause secondary lesions in the somatosensory nervous system could ultimately be considered as being partly neuropathic pain.

Recognizing the challenges of determining the presence of neuropathic pain according to this new definition, NeuPSIG also proposed a grading systemto guide decisions on the level of certainty with which neuropathic pain can be determined in an individual patient. Three levels of certainty — possible, probable, and definite neuropathic pain — were proposed. As an activity in the Global Year Against Neuropathic Pain, NeuPSIG established a committee to (1) critically evaluate the use of the grading system in the 7 years after its publication, (2) assess the usefulness and limitations of the grading system, and (3) update the grading system if required, for improved application in clinical and research settings. The committee consisted of an expert panel of neurologists, clinical neurophysiologists, neuroscientists, anesthesiologists, pain specialists, primary care physicians, and population health scientists.

### Advances in understanding nociception and neuropathic pain [^115aUZ7q]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Although animal models of neuropathic pain have their limitations and translation is currently far from perfect, such models have identified changes at all levels in the pain pathway in neuropathic pain, from alterations in sensory neurone protein expression to changes in spinal cord synaptic function and in the descending control of pain from the brain, some of which will now be discussed to shed light on potential future medications.

### Contemporary management of pain in cirrhosis: toward precision therapy for pain [^115ir1ny]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain is highly prevalent in patients with cirrhosis and is associated with poor health-related quality of life and poor functional status. However, there is limited guidance on appropriate pain management in this population, and pharmacologic treatment can be harmful, leading to adverse outcomes, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, renal injury, falls, and hepatic encephalopathy. Chronic pain can be categorized mechanistically into three pain types: nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic, each responsive to different therapies. By discussing the identification, etiology, and treatment of these three mechanistic pain descriptors with a focus on specific challenges in patients with cirrhosis, we provide a framework for better tailoring treatments, including nonpharmacologic therapies, to patients' needs.

### Painful truth: the need to Re-center chronic pain on the functional role of pain [^116EH2vM]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

What is the Functional Role of Pain?

Simply, pain warns us of potential danger to tissue harm or to the presence of injury. This insult can be within or outside the nervous system, physical or chemical, visible or not. Although the characteristics of pain may differ, the role is still the same; pain is the body's alert system. Research on congenital insensitivity to pain demonstrates that the inability to feel pain is associated with increased injury, associated infection and a shorter lifespan.

Of note, this manuscript focuses on "physical" pain consistent with the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) definition of pain(see Table 1), which includes an important emotional component. However, the focus will not be "psychological pain" itself, which is an equally important but distinct phenomenon,(eg, psychological pain as experienced in depression, not as the psychological features of physical pain which themselves may be associated with depression). Additionally, the use of "functional pain" here should not be confused with the term as used in neurology to apply to chronic pain conditions without clear, organic origin.

The term functional pain is used here to describe pain that results from the human body's innate ability to protect itself, ie, the function of pain (Table 1). This is pain that is normal — pain that is a result of a functional somatosensory system. It is not to imply that any specific experience of pain needs to confer direct benefit to the individual from our Westernized, modern-day perspective in order for it to be normal. Rather, our somatosensory and associated systems (herein referred to as the "pain system" for brevity) evolved to function in a way that, in evolutionary terms, conferred a survival benefit via the ability to feel pain. When pain reflects these normal processes, then it is functional as is often implied in research on pain. However, current knowledge of the neurophysiological underpinnings of the role of pain is limited due to its complexity (see recommendation sections on evolutionary origins, systems approaches, and translation).

### Quantifying cerebral contributions to pain beyond nociception [^111uLXqM]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Cerebral processes contribute to pain beyond the level of nociceptive input and mediate psychological and behavioural influences. However, cerebral contributions beyond nociception are not yet well characterized, leading to a predominant focus on nociception when studying pain and developing interventions. Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging combined with machine learning to develop a multivariate pattern signature-termed the stimulus intensity independent pain signature-1 (SIIPS1)-that predicts pain above and beyond nociceptive input in four training data sets (Studies 1–4, N = 137). The SIIPS1 includes patterns of activity in nucleus accumbens, lateral prefrontal and parahippocampal cortices, and other regions. In cross-validated analyses of Studies 1–4 and in two independent test data sets (Studies 5–6, N = 46), SIIPS1 responses explain variation in trial-by-trial pain ratings not captured by a previous fMRI-based marker for nociceptive pain. In addition, SIIPS1 responses mediate the pain-modulating effects of three psychological manipulations of expectations and perceived control. The SIIPS1 provides an extensible characterization of cerebral contributions to pain and specific brain targets for interventions.

### Revisiting the continuum model of tendon pathology: what is its merit in clinical practice and research? [^112fyA28]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The pain-free tendon may contain substantial matrix and cell abnormalities, but limited nociceptive substance production, signalling ability or receptor activation, which is in summary an insufficient nociceptive stimulus. The role of the central nervous system in the modulation of nociception and output of pain is acknowledged and well described by others; however, it is beyond the scope of this paper.

Loading a painful tendon perpetuates nociceptive stimuli, and it is plausible that secondary hyperalgesia in tendinopathy is a response to ongoing nociception. Hyperalgesia by itself does not define tendinopathy as a pathophysiological pain state or centrally driven phenomenon. Several clinical features support this concept; tendon pain remains localised and temporally linked to tissue loading, with little evidence of spontaneous tendon pain (stimulus-independent pain) that is a feature of other pathophysiological pain states.

Some consider tendinopathy to be centrally driven, while also questioning the relevance of local changes in tendon structure. While there is evidence of contralateral sensory perception changes in people with tendinopathy, this can equally reflect persistent nociceptive drive from the local tissue. Acute pain conditions, such as acute inversion ankle sprain, also caused secondary hyperalgesia; however, this can be reversed instantaneously with an anaesthetic. This suggests that the nociceptive input from the periphery maintains sensitisation. Unilateral isometric exercises in patellar tendinopathy have no effect on contralateral pain, suggesting that local factors or pathways are critical in pain production. In summary, we acknowledge that there is good evidence for adaptations (both motor and sensory) in tendinopathy, yet we cannot dismiss the role of local nociceptively driven pain.

### Nociplastic pain: towards an understanding of prevalent pain conditions [^112MkLJ6]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Nociplastic pain is the semantic term suggested by the international community of pain researchers to describe a third category of pain that is mechanistically distinct from nociceptive pain, which is caused by ongoing inflammation and damage of tissues, and neuropathic pain, which is caused by nerve damage. The mechanisms that underlie this type of pain are not entirely understood, but it is thought that augmented CNS pain and sensory processing and altered pain modulation play prominent roles. The symptoms observed in nociplastic pain include multifocal pain that is more widespread or intense, or both, than would be expected given the amount of identifiable tissue or nerve damage, as well as other CNS-derived symptoms, such as fatigue, sleep, memory, and mood problems. This type of pain can occur in isolation, as often occurs in conditions such as fibromyalgia or tension-type headache, or as part of a mixed-pain state in combination with ongoing nociceptive or neuropathic pain, as might occur in chronic low back pain. It is important to recognise this type of pain, since it will respond to different therapies than nociceptive pain, with a decreased responsiveness to peripherally directed therapies such as anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids, surgery, or injections.

### A systematic review of genome-wide association studies for pain, nociception, neuropathy, and pain treatment responses [^1116x5em]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Pain is the leading cause of disability worldwide, imposing an enormous burden on personal health and society. Pain is a multifactorial and multidimensional problem. Currently, there is (some) evidence that genetic factors could partially explain individual susceptibility to pain and interpersonal differences in pain treatment response. To better understand the underlying genetic mechanisms of pain, we systematically reviewed and summarized genome-wide association studies (GWASes) investigating the associations between genetic variants and pain/pain-related phenotypes in humans. We reviewed 57 full-text articles and identified 30 loci reported in more than 1 study. To check whether genes described in this review are associated with (other) pain phenotypes, we searched 2 pain genetic databases, Human Pain Genetics Database and Mouse Pain Genetics Database. Six GWAS-identified genes/loci were also reported in those databases, mainly involved in neurological functions and inflammation. These findings demonstrate an important contribution of genetic factors to the risk of pain and pain-related phenotypes. However, replication studies with consistent phenotype definitions and sufficient statistical power are required to validate these pain-associated genes further. Our review also highlights the need for bioinformatic tools to elucidate the function of identified genes/loci. We believe that a better understanding of the genetic background of pain will shed light on the underlying biological mechanisms of pain and benefit patients by improving the clinical management of pain.

### Composite pain biomarker signatures for objective assessment and effective treatment [^113ci28o]. Neuron (2019). Medium credibility.

Pain is a subjective sensory experience that can, mostly, be reported but cannot be directly measured or quantified. Nevertheless, a suite of biomarkers related to mechanisms, neural activity, and susceptibility offer the possibility-especially when used in combination-to produce objective pain-related indicators with the specificity and sensitivity required for diagnosis and for evaluation of risk of developing pain and of analgesic efficacy. Such composite biomarkers will also provide improved understanding of pain pathophysiology.

### Central nervous system targets: supraspinal mechanisms of analgesia [^1123iQML]. Neurotherapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

While the acute sensation of pain is protective, signaling the presence of actual or potential bodily harm, its persistence is unpleasant. When pain becomes chronic, it has limited evolutionarily advantage. Despite the differing nature of acute and chronic pain, a common theme is that sufferers seek pain relief. The possibility to medicate pain types as varied as a toothache or postsurgical pain reflects the diverse range of mechanism(s) by which pain-relieving "analgesic" therapies may reduce, eliminate, or prevent pain. Systemic application of an analgesic able to cross the blood-brain barrier can result in pain modulation via interaction with targets at different sites in the central nervous system. A so-called supraspinal mechanism of action indicates manipulation of a brain-defined circuitry. Pre-clinical studies demonstrate that, according to the brain circuitry targeted, varying therapeutic pain-relieving effects may be observed that relate to an impact on, for example, sensory and/or affective qualities of pain. In many cases, this translates to the clinic. Regardless of the brain circuitry manipulated, modulation of brain processing often directly impacts multiple aspects of nociceptive transmission, including spinal neuronal signaling. Consideration of supraspinal mechanisms of analgesia and ensuing pain relief must take into account nonbrain-mediated effects; therefore, in this review, the supraspinally mediated analgesic actions of opioidergic, anti-convulsant, and anti-depressant drugs are discussed. The persistence of poor treatment outcomes and/or side effect profiles of currently used analgesics highlight the need for the development of novel therapeutics or more precise use of available agents. Fully uncovering the complex biology of nociception, as well as currently used analgesic mechanism(s) and site(s) of action, will expedite this process.

### Deciphering nociplastic pain: clinical features, risk factors and potential mechanisms [^111HmrGq]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Nociplastic pain is a mechanistic term used to describe pain that arises or is sustained by altered nociception, despite the absence of tissue damage. Although nociplastic pain has distinct pathophysiology from nociceptive and neuropathic pain, these pain mechanisms often coincide within individuals, which contributes to the intractability of chronic pain. Key symptoms of nociplastic pain include pain in multiple body regions, fatigue, sleep disturbances, cognitive dysfunction, depression and anxiety. Individuals with nociplastic pain are often diffusely tender - indicative of hyperalgesia and/or allodynia - and are often more sensitive than others to non-painful sensory stimuli such as lights, odours and noises. This Review summarizes the risk factors, clinical presentation and treatment of nociplastic pain, and describes how alterations in brain function and structure, immune processing and peripheral factors might contribute to the nociplastic pain phenotype. This article concludes with a discussion of two proposed subtypes of nociplastic pain that reflect distinct neurobiological features and treatment responsivity.

### Pain: friend or foe? A neurobiologic perspective: the 2008 bonica award lecture [^113YPD3r]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Pain is a protective sensation, but it can also be a burden without any useful value. Pain as a friend warns of impending damage and protects the body from injury. Pain as a foe is a useless sensation that makes the underlying problem worse and becomes a disease in its own right. Mechanistically, the systems that mediate good pain and bad pain are often the same, with bad pain being the result of such mechanisms being triggered inappropriately, by irrelevant stimuli or with a time course and intensity disproportionate to the originating cause. We are beginning to know more about the neurobiology of bad pain. The relevant mechanisms are often linked to dysfunction or disease of the nervous system, either of the peripheral nerves or of the central nervous system itself. For example, under normal conditions, activity in large, myelinated A[beta]-fibers inhibits nociceptive primary afferent inputs to the central nervous system. However, in inflammatory and neuropathic conditions, these actions are reversed, leading to touch-evoked pain or tactile allodynia. The mechanism responsible for this reversal is a change in the synaptic actions of [gamma]-aminobutyric acid that switches from being an inhibitory neurotransmitter to an excitatory one. Our challenge was to devise methods for pain relief based on elimination of the useless aspects of pain and the restoration of the protective qualities of normal pain sensation.

### Pain mechanisms in patients with rheumatic diseases [^113iztgM]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients with rheumatic diseases often have mixed pain states, with varying degrees of nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic mechanisms, which exist on a continuum. When individuals with any chronic pain have a nociplastic component to their symptoms, they are less likely to respond to treatments (eg, injections, surgery, biologics, and opioids) that work better for acute or purely nociceptive pain.

### Spinal cord mechanisms of pain [^114HEBrR]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

The spinal cord is the first relay site in the transmission of nociceptive information from the periphery to the brain. Sensory signals are transmitted from the periphery by primary afferent fibres into the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, where these afferents synapse with intrinsic spinal dorsal horn neurones. Spinal projection neurones then convey this information to higher centres in the brain, where non-noxious and noxious signals can be perceived. During nociceptive transmission, the output of the spinal cord is dependent on various spinal mechanisms which can either increase or decrease the activity of dorsal horn neurones. Such mechanisms include local excitatory and inhibitory interneurones, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation, and descending influences from the brainstem, which can be both inhibitory and excitatory in nature. After nerve injury or conditions of inflammation, shifts can occur in these excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms which modulate spinal excitability, often resulting in the heightened response of dorsal neurones to incoming afferent signals, and increased output to the brain, a phenomenon known as central sensitization. In this review, we consider the ways in which spinal cord activity may be altered in chronic pain states. In addition, we discuss the spinal mechanisms which are targeted by current analgesics used in the management of chronic pain.

### Peripheral gating of pain signals by endogenous lipid mediators [^1163hXzw]. Nature Neuroscience (2014). Medium credibility.

Primary sensory afferents and their neighboring host-defense cells are a rich source of lipid-derived mediators that contribute to the sensation of pain caused by tissue damage and inflammation. But an increasing number of lipid molecules have been shown to act in an opposite way, to suppress the inflammatory process, restore homeostasis in damaged tissues and attenuate pain sensitivity by regulating neural pathways that transmit nociceptive signals from the periphery of the body to the CNS. Here we review the molecular and cellular mechanisms that contribute to the modulatory actions of lipid mediators in peripheral nociceptive signaling.

### Functional brain imaging: what has it brought to our understanding of neuropathic pain? A special focus on allodynic pain mechanisms [^111GwuAN]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

Brain responses to nociception are well identified. The same is not true for allodynic pain, a strong painful sensation in response to touch or innocuous cold stimuli that may be experienced by patients with neuropathic pain. Brain (or spinal cord) reorganization that may explain this paradoxical perception still remains largely unknown. Allodynic pain is associated with abnormally increased activity in SII and in the anterior insular cortex, contralateral and/or ipsilateral to allodynia. Because a bilateral increase in activity has been repeatedly reported in these areas in nociceptive conditions, the observed activation during allodynia can explain that a physiologically nonpainful stimulus could be perceived by the damaged nervous system as a painful one. Both secondary somatosensory and insular cortices receive input from the thalamus, which is a major relay of sensory and spinothalamic pathways, the involvement of which is known to be crucial for the development of neuropathic pain. Both thalamic function and structure have been reported to be abnormal or impaired in neuropathic pain conditions including in the basal state, possibly explaining the spontaneous component of neuropathic pain. A further indication as to how the brain can create neuropathic pain response in SII and insular cortices stems from examples of diseases, including single-case reports in whom a focal brain lesion leads to central pain disappearance. Additional studies are required to certify the contribution of these areas to the disease processes, to disentangle abnormalities respectively related to pain and to deafferentation, and, in the future, to guide targeting of stimulation studies.

### Allodynia and hyperalgesia in neuropathic pain: clinical manifestations and mechanisms [^116jXSdn]. The Lancet: Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Allodynia (pain due to a stimulus that does not usually provoke pain) and hyperalgesia (increased pain from a stimulus that usually provokes pain) are prominent symptoms in patients with neuropathic pain. Both are seen in various peripheral neuropathies and central pain disorders, and affect 15–50% of patients with neuropathic pain. Allodynia and hyperalgesia are classified according to the sensory modality (touch, pressure, pinprick, cold, and heat) that is used to elicit the sensation. Peripheral sensitisation and maladaptive central changes contribute to the generation and maintenance of these reactions, with separate mechanisms in different subtypes of allodynia and hyperalgesia. Pain intensity and relief are important measures in clinical pain studies, but might be insufficient to capture the complexity of the pain experience. Better understanding of allodynia and hyperalgesia might provide clues to the underlying pathophysiology of neuropathic pain and, as such, they represent new or additional endpoints in pain trials.

### The revised international association for the study of pain definition of pain: concepts, challenges, and compromises [^114xgZ2C]. Pain (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The current International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) definition of pain as "An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage" was recommended by the Subcommittee on Taxonomy and adopted by the IASP Council in 1979. This definition has become accepted widely by health care professionals and researchers in the pain field and adopted by several professional, governmental, and nongovernmental organizations, including the World Health Organization. In recent years, some in the field have reasoned that advances in our understanding of pain warrant a reevaluation of the definition and have proposed modifications. Therefore, in 2018, the IASP formed a 14-member, multinational Presidential Task Force comprising individuals with broad expertise in clinical and basic science related to pain, to evaluate the current definition and accompanying note and recommend whether they should be retained or changed. This review provides a synopsis of the critical concepts, the analysis of comments from the IASP membership and public, and the committee's final recommendations for revisions to the definition and notes, which were discussed over a 2-year period. The task force ultimately recommended that the definition of pain be revised to "An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage", and that the accompanying notes be updated to a bulleted list that included the etymology. The revised definition and notes were unanimously accepted by the IASP Council early this year.

### Neocortical circuits in pain and pain relief [^1173q8bJ]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2021). High credibility.

The sensory, associative and limbic neocortical structures play a critical role in shaping incoming noxious inputs to generate variable pain perceptions. Technological advances in tracing circuitry and interrogation of pathways and complex behaviours are now yielding critical knowledge of neocortical circuits, cellular contributions and causal relationships between pain perception and its abnormalities in chronic pain. Emerging insights into neocortical pain processing suggest the existence of neocortical causality and specificity for pain at the level of subdomains, circuits and cellular entities and the activity patterns they encode. These mechanisms provide opportunities for therapeutic intervention for improved pain management.

### Towards harmonizing the concepts and definitions of pain in the World Health Organization's family of international classifications [^116BGEPD]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

2. The International Association for the Study of Pain definition of pain

In 1979, the IASP definition of painintroduced the notion that pain has an affective (or emotional) and a sensory component and, therefore, represents the biopsychosocial definition of pain. People who experience pain generally do not differentiate between the emotional and sensory components. The perception of pain is often induced by potential or actual damage to some body structure: organs or tissues (nociceptive pain) or the somatosensory nervous system (neuropathic pain). However, pain may also be experienced in the absence of any demonstrable bodily damage, such as chronic primary pain conditions (eg, chronic widespread pain, fibromyalgia syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome, chronic low-back pain, or chronic migraine). Pain can also persist beyond the successful healing of tissue damage, as is the case of chronic secondary pain (eg, chronic post-traumatic pain).

The 1979 definition was criticized for not being applicable to preverbal or nonverbal populations such as infants or patients with dementia. These populations can obviously experience acute and chronic pain even if they cannot describe their pain regarding actual or potential tissue damage. In 2020, the IASP approved the revision of its 1979 definition of pain (Table 2). The current IASP definition of pain is the culmination of a 2-year review process conducted by a 14-member international task force comprising experts in clinical and basic science related to pain. This review process involved a modified Delphi survey of more than 800 persons (clinicians, clinical and basic science researchers, administrators, educators, trainees/students, persons living with pain or with pain-related disability, and caregivers). The current IASP definition of pain (Table 2,) has been included in the ICD-11.

### Pain TRPs [^111Z8K9q]. Neuron (2005). Low credibility.

Transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels are molecular gateways in sensory systems, an interface between the environment and the nervous system. Several TRPs transduce thermal, chemical, and mechanical stimuli into inward currents, an essential first step for eliciting thermal and pain sensations. Precise regulation of the expression, localization, and function of the TRP channels is crucial for their sensory role in nociceptor terminals, particularly after inflammation, when they contribute to pain hypersensitivity by undergoing changes in translation and trafficking as well as diverse posttranslational modifications.

### Chronic overlapping pain conditions and nociplastic pain [^113Mopsn]. HGG Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic pain can be defined as pain that persists 3+ monthsand is a main symptom of many conditions as well as being associated with injury and surgery. Recently, the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) also redefined pain and "chronic primary pain" codes for the International Classification of Diseases, 11 th Edition (ICD-11). More than 1 in 5 US adults experience chronic pain, and chronic pain is associated with high socioeconomic and quality-of-life burden,

Mechanistic pain descriptors, neuropathic and nociceptive, are used to categorize pain and chronic pain according to suspected or confirmed underlying mechanism(s). Neuropathic pain is defined as being caused by lesions or disease in the somatosensory nervous system, and nociceptive pain, designed to directly contrast neuropathic pain, is defined as pain arising from actual or threatened damage to non-neural tissue. However, pain experienced in the context of many different chronic pain conditions may not fit with these two descriptors; therefore, a proposed third mechanistic pain descriptor, "nociplastic pain", was added to IASP terminologyin 2017. Nociplastic pain is defined as pain arising from altered nociception in the absence of clear lesion/disease of the somatosensory nervous system and/or absence of actual or threatened tissue damage causing activation of peripheral nociceptors, and is associated, compared with nociceptive or neuropathic pain, with greater risk of CNS-related symptoms such as fatigue, changes in cognition and memory, depression, and anxiety.

### Delayed onset and resolution of pain: some observations and implications [^116Gn68T]. Brain (2001). Low credibility.

Occasionally, pain after disease or trauma develops only after a prolonged interval. Examples include late-onset pains which first occur months or years following a stroke, spinal cord lesion or amputation of a limb; a previously experienced pain that is recalled years later; and latent pain triggered for the first time by a further insult in the same area. Late-onset pains may develop gradually or suddenly, and may be brief or long standing. Pains which develop after an innocuous insult may be associated with slowly evolving sensory changes. However, even long-standing pains, particularly those of nociceptive origin, may resolve sometimes after many years. Resolution, which again can occur gradually or suddenly, may be spontaneous or follow development of another disorder or after therapeutic intervention. The duration of this pain relief can range from minutes to an indefinite period. These clinical phenomena, and the mechanisms, including genetic factors, subserving them, have been little studied. It is postulated that mechanisms implicated in acute pain may not be the same as those that subserve pain that develops after a long interval. Those late-onset pains which develop slowly after innocuous lesions may be associated with a variety of slow anatomical, physiological and biochemical changes. In late-onset pains that follow a painful insult, however, memory of the former pain and threshold triggering factors may be particularly important. Further studies of these neglected conditions may lead to understanding of as yet unknown processes subserving pain and to novel approaches to treatment.

### Nociceptive flexion reflex threshold in chronic pain patients: a needed update for the current evidence [^112F3X1n]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The nociceptive flexion reflex is a physiological, polysynaptic reflex triggered by a nociceptive stimulus activating a withdrawal response. In chronic musculoskeletal-related pain conditions, a decreased nociceptive flexion reflex threshold has been suggested as a possible recognition evidence for central sensitization that may cause alteration of central nervous system processing.

Objective

The aim of the study was to systematically review reported comparisons of the nociceptive flexion reflex threshold in chronic pain patients and healthy individuals.

Methods

Electronic databases covering studies published between January 1990 and December 2019 were systematically searched. After application of exclusion criteria, 20 studies including 28 trials were included in this review. For meta-analysis, we used a random-effects model and funnel plot for publication bias. This research was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42019140354).

Results

Compared with healthy controls, standardized mean differences in nociceptive flexion reflex threshold were significantly lower in the total sample of chronic pain patients. Subgroup analysis indicated a homogenous decreased nociceptive flexion reflex threshold in studies reporting fibromyalgia, chronic pain, and joint pain while heterogeneity existed in other included pain conditions.

Conclusions

A lower nociceptive flexion reflex threshold in patients experiencing chronic pain conditions may imply hyperexcitability in central nervous system processing. As a preliminary study, the findings would act as a basis for developing a methodology assisting current clinical practices.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^111AxrX9]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Pain management in the intensive care unit — key points — validated measurement tools to assess pain are an important component of any analgesic program in the ICU. An ICU multimodal analgesia (MMA) protocol is needed to match medications and their doses/titration to the severity of the patient's pain. Use opioids as first-line agents for patients with severe, acute nociceptive pain in the ICU setting as part of an MMA pain management plan. Consider patient comorbidities and medical history (e.g., alcohol or SUD and chronic renal failure) when choosing medications for analgesia and sedation. Transition patients from parenteral to enteral medications prior to transfer from the ICU, when possible.

### Rehabilitation management of low back pain-it's time to pull it all together! [^114qGWkH]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Conceptual operationalization

A two-step process can be used to determine whether a patient has predominantly nociceptive pain and driving his/her LBP. The first step would be to confirm the presence of nociceptive pain with tools such as, but not limited to, the Pain Detect Questionnaire, a questionnaire that can be used as an objective diagnostic tool to distinguish nociceptive from neuropathic pain. The score indicates the likeliness of pain being nociceptive versus neuropathic. Once you have determined that there is a nociceptive component to the patient's symptoms, the patient should be assessed as recommended by practice guidelinesusing stratified care, which implies the use of a CS, such as the treatment-based CS. If you have determined that your patient meets the CS profile, then the patient should be provided with treatments matching their clinical characteristics and needs. The treatment approaches guided by CS, which mainly focus on deficits/impairments related to the biological aspects explaining the experience of pain, are fully capable of providing solutions addressing the nociceptive component of LBP.

If the patient has nociceptive pain but cannot be provided treatment guided by CS, hence a "non-responder", then the clinician should assess for other possible elements driving nociceptive pain. This would be the case for patients with post-surgical conditions (or structural stability deficits), which are likely to exhibit mechanical LBP, but without a specific mechanical pattern. Similar principles apply for highly deconditioned patients, where pain is likely to be nociceptive, but not associated with any specific mechanical pattern. Consequently, positive outcomes using CS guided by a movement-based classification or the functional optimization group of the treatment-based classificationis less likely. Yet, these patients are likely to have somatic or inflammatory pain, both of which can be classified under nociceptive pain category, and it is anticipated that they will respond to general (non-specific) exercises, which will induce analgesia through specific analgesic mechanism. Thus, for the non-responders, the specificity of the exercises is less important.

Finally, we need to keep in mind that these treatment approaches mainly target nociceptive drivers of pain, and as explained earlier, disability is driven by multiple domains; hence, rehabilitation professionals will most likely need to look further. Considering that the sensory characteristics of pain in patients with LBP may be heterogeneousand that a continuum between nociceptive and neuropathic pain in LBP may exist, it may be relevant to explore other aspects of nervous system implications as drivers of pain.

### A mechanism-based classification of pain in multiple sclerosis [^111AtkMx]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Research into pain and pain management has long debated the relationship symptom-mechanism-treatment. Newly proposed screening questionnaires, and diagnostic procedures such as quantitative sensory testing, pain-related evoked potentials, and skin biopsy, have advanced the mechanistic approach to pain management leading to the development of the so-called sensory profiles.

Making a specific diagnosis, understanding the underlying pathophysiological mechanism and implementing the proper treatment strategy depends first of all on clearly defining the various types of pain.

In this partly systematic but largely argumentative review, we sought epidemiological and pharmacological studies on MS-related pain. Seeking support for our proposed mechanism-based classification for MS-related pain, we then reviewed studies that help to define and understand the various types of MS-related pain. From current knowledge, our own clinical experience, and information gained from our review, we then tried to classify the different types of MS-related pain according to the underlying pathophysiological mechanism.

We distinguish five pain categories, nociceptive, neuropathic, psychogenic, idiopathic, and mixed. These categories are variably established in the literature. A PubMed search including papers published from inception date to 2011 showed how many articles used these terms:
neuropathic pain: 7,759,
nociceptive pain (378) or inflammatory pain (1,868); total: 2,246,
psychogenic pain (171) or somatoform pain (136) or pain behavior (244); total: 551,
idiopathic pain: 74,
mixed pain: 46.

To sharpen the distinction between nociceptive pain (whether inflammatory or non-inflammatory), namely pain resulting from nociceptor activation by true or potentially tissue-damaging stimuli, and neuropathic pain, the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) has redefined neuropathic pain as pain arising directly from a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system. The previous definition (pain initiated or caused by a primary nervous system lesion or dysfunction) left room for numerous conditions that are neither really or wholly neuropathic. For example, the word dysfunction allowed inclusion of pain related to secondary functional and neuroplastic changes in the nervous system resulting from sufficiently strong nociceptive stimulation, e.g. central sensitization. The phrasing initiated by a primary lesion in the nervous system left room for any pain in neurological disease, in particular all musculoskeletal pains secondary to movement disorders, a major problem in patients with MS.

### Contemporary management of pain in cirrhosis: toward precision therapy for pain [^116X5vox]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

OPPORTUNITIES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC PAIN

Pain management is moving toward a precision approach based on the type of pain a patient is experiencing (Figure 2). This is especially true in the setting of central sensitization or nociplastic pain, for which the effective treatments are different than those used to treat nociceptive pain. There are limited data mapping the types of chronic pain that individuals with cirrhosis might experience and to consider the concept of nociplastic pain or "central sensitization" in addition to pain from tissue damage (nociceptive) or nerve damage (neuropathic). Patients with cirrhosis have a disproportionately high burden of nociceptive pain (e.g. fractures, abdominal distension, muscle cramping)and neuropathic pain (e.g. peripheral neuropathy),–as well as an unknown prevalence of nociplastic pain (e.g. disorders of the brain–gut interaction). However, it is likely that nociplastic pain contributes to the burden of chronic pain in patients with cirrhosis given that multiple common conditions, such as low back pain and osteoarthritis, can be considered "mixed pain" states, in that they can have nociceptive, neuropathic, and/or nociplastic elements. Furthermore, continuous nociceptive pain states (e.g. arthritis, cancer) can lead to nociplastic pain.

FIGURE 2
Algorithm for the treatment of chronic pain based on mechanism. Summary of recommendations for the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of chronic pain in patients with cirrhosis, emphasizing nonpharmacologic therapies as first‐line treatment. BID, two times a day; PRN, as needed; q6, every six hours; qHS, every night at bedtime; NSAID, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drug; SNRI, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor; TCA, tricyclic antidepressant.

Optimal treatment for nociplastic pain contrasts with that for nociceptive pain, where therapy is generally peripherally directed (e.g. analgesics, opioids, injections), and instead involves an emphasis on nonpharmacologic therapies. Failure to select therapies for the mechanism of pain will result in suboptimal outcomes. Accordingly, there is a pressing need to apply tools to identify nociplastic pain in cirrhosis and develop interventions to address it.

### Towards precision pain medicine for pain after cancer: the cancer pain phenotyping network multidisciplinary international guidelines for pain phenotyping using nociplastic pain criteria [^117SA13r]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Pain after cancer remains underestimated and undertreated. Precision medicine is a recent concept that refers to the ability to classify patients into subgroups that differ in their susceptibility to, biology, or prognosis of a particular disease, or in their response to a specific treatment, and thus to tailor treatment to the individual patient characteristics. Applying this to pain after cancer, the ability to classify post-cancer pain into the three major pain phenotypes (i.e. nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic pain) and tailor pain treatment accordingly, is an emerging issue. This is especially relevant because available evidence suggests that nociplastic pain is present in an important subgroup of those patients experiencing post-cancer pain. The 2021 International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) clinical criteria and grading system for nociplastic pain account for the need to identify and correctly classify patients according to the pain phenotype early in their treatment. These criteria are an important step towards precision pain medicine with great potential for the field of clinical oncology. Within this framework, the Cancer Pain Phenotyping (CANPPHE) Network, an international and interdisciplinary group of oncology clinicians and researchers from seven countries, applied the 2021 IASP clinical criteria for nociplastic pain to the growing population of those experiencing post-cancer pain. A manual is provided to allow clinicians to differentiate between predominant nociceptive, neuropathic, or nociplastic pain after cancer. A seven-step diagnostic approach is presented and illustrated using cases to enhance understanding and encourage effective implementation of this approach in clinical practice.

Domains and their operational definitions

The five domains included in the proposed model are aligned alongside drivers of pain and/or disability. As pain is the most often reported deficit/impairment in LBP, it is first important to accurately appraise the relative importance of pain and its effect on function (disability) with adopted and recognized tools, as the ones proposed by the Initiative on Methods, Measurements and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trial (IMMPACT). The IMMPACT group has proposed specific assessment tools for core outcome domains in chronic pain, which have been adopted by many stakeholders.

As an attempt to quantify the relative contribution (severity) of each domain of interest, the domains we have included in our model contain two categories, the first (A) implicates more common and/or modifiable elements, whereas the second (B) involves elements that are more complex, less modifiable, and that will prompt more aggressive or require interdisciplinary care to more effectively address the problematic domain. Although these domains can interact and their relative individual contribution to pain and disability can modulate through time, the model gives a structure upon which the clinician can base its assessment (patient profiling) and consequently better target treatments, while reflecting a true biopsychosocial approach, as embraced by the ICF. The visual representation of the model is presented in Figure 1.

Domain 1 – nociceptive pain drivers

Nociceptive pain is "pain that arises from actual or threatened damage to non-neural tissue and is due to the activation of nociceptors". The presence of nociceptive pain relates to the ICF as it is linked to deficits and impairments in body functions and structures. As the most frequent and primary driver of painful symptoms in cases of LBP result from the nociceptive system (somatic, inflammatory, or mixed pain), specific strategies to achieve pain control should initially target this driver of pain. This domain is composed of "responders to classification systems" (category A) and "non-responders to classification systems" (category B). Table 1 provides the operational definitions.

### Methods to discriminate between mechanism-based categories of pain experienced in the musculoskeletal system: a systematic review [^111CYeSc]. Pain (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Mechanism-based classification of pain has been advocated widely to aid tailoring of interventions for individuals experiencing persistent musculoskeletal pain. Three pain mechanism categories (PMCs) are defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain: nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic pain. Discrimination between them remains challenging. This study aimed to build on a framework developed to converge the diverse literature of PMCs to systematically review methods purported to discriminate between them; synthesise and thematically analyse these methods to identify the convergence and divergence of opinion; and report validation, psychometric properties, and strengths/weaknesses of these methods. The search strategy identified articles discussing methods to discriminate between mechanism-based categories of pain experienced in the musculoskeletal system. Studies that assessed the validity of methods to discriminate between categories were assessed for quality. Extraction and thematic analysis were undertaken on 184 articles. Data synthesis identified 200 methods in 5 themes: clinical examination, quantitative sensory testing, imaging, diagnostic and laboratory testing, and pain-type questionnaires. Few methods have been validated for discrimination between PMCs. There was general convergence but some disagreement regarding findings that discriminate between PMCs. A combination of features and methods, rather than a single method, was generally recommended to discriminate between PMCs. Two major limitations were identified: an overlap of findings of methods between categories due to mixed presentations and many methods considered discrimination between 2 PMCs but not others. The results of this review provide a foundation to refine methods to differentiate mechanisms for musculoskeletal pain.

1. Introduction

Pain, especially chronic pain, is a condition that greatly impacts the quality of life. The prevalence of chronic pain in adults is approximately 20%, and it increases with age. Chronic painful conditions are the leading causes of years lived with disability, and they can contribute to the development of other health conditions, such as disability, depression, and sleep disturbances. Besides the burden for patients, chronic pain can have enormous socioeconomic consequences directly or indirectly, eg, because of absenteeism. For example, the total costs associated with only low back pain in European countries are estimated to be 0.1% to 2% of gross domestic product.

Pain is a subjective experience with very heterogeneous presentations. Pain can be acute or chronic; acute pain is usually associated with tissue damage and generally eases with the healing of tissue, whereas chronic pain persists or recurs for more than 3 months. Chronic pain can develop without a clear etiology or pathophysiology (chronic primary pain, eg, fibromyalgia) or secondary to an underlying disease (chronic secondary pain, eg, chronic pain associated with osteoarthritis). There is a distinction between nociceptive pain (pain from ongoing tissue inflammation or damage) and neuropathic pain (pain caused by nerve damage). More recently, the term nociplastic pain has been proposed to describe the clinically and psychophysically altered nociception that cannot directly be linked to nociceptive or neuropathic pain. Nociplastic pain is defined as pain that arises from altered nociception despite no clear evidence of actual or threatened tissue damage causing the activation of peripheral nociceptors or evidence for disease or lesion of the somatosensory system causing the pain (International Association for the Study of Pain [IASP] terminology). Examples of nociplastic pain are fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome. Although there are differences in the pathways leading to the different types of pain, part of the underlying mechanisms may be shared, such as structural changes in the brain, central sensitization, and neurochemical imbalances in the central nervous system.

Mixed Pain

Some CRPS patients may experience substantial overlap between nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic pain. Although mixed pain is not recognized by the IASP, Freynhagen et al defined mixed pain as follows: "mixed pain is a complex overlap of the different known pain types (nociceptive, neuropathic, nociplastic) in any combination, acting simultaneously and/or concurrently to cause pain in the same body area". The term mixed pain was introduced to help clinicians with the challenge of the management of mixed pain states. However, the authors question whether mixed pain is simply a combination of nociceptive, neuropathic, or nociplastic pain, or whether mixed pain is a new clinical entity on its own. An example of mixed pain could, for instance, be a patient with spinal disc herniation. When a spinal disc starts to bulge out and the nerve route is hampered by the mass of the herniation and the local inflammatory process, we call this nociceptive pain. The nerve route can get impinged and damaged, which will result in neuropathic pain. When these processes occur simultaneously―disc bulging, inflammation, and the nerve impingement―the pain can be characterized as mixed pain.

At present, there is no diagnostic test for mixed pain, but it can be pragmatically diagnosed by history taking, physical examination and by using the diagnostic criteria for nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic pain. Freynhagen et al developed nine key questions to help identify the most dominant pain type of the patient. Physicians must be aware that mixed pain states are common, but we acknowledge that the phenotype of mixed pain is challenging.

### Factors predicting outcomes from chronic pain management interventions [^1147SiP1]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Type of injury according to mechanistic categories

Neuropathic pain

Neuropathic pain is caused by a demonstrable lesion or disease of the somatosensory system. Compared with nociceptive pain, neuropathic pain is associated with a poorer prognosis. For spinal surgery, however, results from decompression surgery for radiculopathy are consistently more favourable than those for axial nociceptive pain secondary to degenerative spondylosis.

Nociceptive pain

Nociceptive pain is the most common type of chronic pain and results from activation of nociceptors after actual or potential non-neural tissue injury. Guidelines and large systematic reviews for many nociceptive pain conditions have found small but consistent benefits for non-surgical interventional procedures, such as radiofrequency ablation and joint injections, that exceed risks of harm in well selected patients (ie, based on prognostic blocks for radiofrequency ablation, and diagnostic criteria for joint injections, without strong risk factors for failure). For joint arthroplasties performed for pain and disability secondary to degeneration, favourable long term outcomes have been found with hip, shoulder, and knee replacements.

Nociplastic pain

Nociplastic pain is pain that results from abnormal processing of sensory information and is characterised by the absence of biomarkers. Because the primary physiological mechanism in nociplastic pain is central sensitisation, peripherally focused treatments, such as interventional procedures or surgery, tend to result in poor outcomes. In a large observational study of > 200 patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty, higher preoperative central sensitisation inventory scores were associated with worse outcomes up to two years later. Higher preoperative central sensitisation inventory scores or a pre-existing nociplastic condition are associated with an increased risk of persistent postsurgical pain and dissatisfaction after joint surgery, and poorer outcomes after injections. Similar findings have been found in studiesfor lumbar surgery.

TYPES OF PAIN

Chronic pain can be characterized using three mechanistic descriptors: nociceptive pain, neuropathic pain, and nociplastic pain (Table 1). Nociceptive pain is characterized by ongoing tissue damage or inflammation. Neuropathic pain is characterized by nerve damage in the peripheral or central nervous system (CNS). In contrast, the term "nociplastic pain" was introduced in 2016 to describe pain with no evidence of tissue or nerve damage but with "clinical and psychophysical findings that suggest altered nociception", such as pain associated with fibromyalgia (FM) or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Patients with nociplastic pain may present with a history of widespread pain refractory to intervention (e.g. opioids, surgery), as well as accompanying CNS‐driven complaints (e.g. fatigue, sleep difficulty, mood dysregulation, and memory or concentration problems). The three pain types are not mutually exclusive and can co‐occur with variable degrees of overlap.

### Different types of pain in complex regional pain syndrome require a personalized treatment strategy [^112vDcn8]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a debilitating painful state of an extremity that can develop after trauma. CRPS is diagnosed by the new International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) diagnostic criteria for CRPS. The syndrome is characterized by continuing regional pain with abnormal sensory, motor, sudomotor, vasomotor, edema, and/or trophic signs. The clinical presentation of CRPS can be very heterogeneous because CRPS is a multi-mechanism syndrome. Therefore, mechanism-based subgroups have been suggested to personalize treatment for CRPS. Additionally, the presentation of symptom pain may also be able to identify different subgroups of CRPS. In this review, the types of pain recognized by the IASP-nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic pain-will be discussed as possible subgroups for CRPS. Each pain type should be identified in CRPS patients, with a thorough history taking, physical examination, and diagnostic tests or (novel) biomarkers to optimize treatment effectiveness. Over the course of the syndrome, patients with CRPS probably experience more than one distinct pain type. Therefore, pain specialists should be alert to not only adjust their treatment if underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms tend to change but also to personalize the treatment of the associated type of pain in the CRPS patient.

### Chronic pain in critical care survivors: a narrative review [^111itTuj]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain is an important problem after critical care admission. Estimates of the prevalence of chronic pain in the year after discharge range from 14% to 77% depending on the type of cohort, the tool used to measure pain, and the time point when pain was assessed. The majority of data available come from studies using health-related quality of life tools, although some have included pain-specific tools. Nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic pain can occur in critical care survivors, but limited information about the aetiology, body site, and temporal trajectory of pain is currently available. Older age, pre-existing pain, and medical co-morbidity have been associated with pain after critical care admission. No trials were identified of interventions to target chronic pain in survivors specifically. Larger studies, using pain-specific tools, over an extended follow-up period are required to confirm the prevalence, identify risk factors, explore any association between acute and chronic pain in this setting, determine the underlying pathological mechanisms, and inform the development of future analgesic interventions.

### Peripheral input and its importance for central sensitization [^111u6gEJ]. Annals of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Many pain states begin with damage to tissue and/or nerves in the periphery, leading to enhanced transmitter release within the spinal cord and central sensitization. Manifestations of this central sensitization are windup and long-term potentiation. Hyperexcitable spinal neurons show reduced thresholds, greater evoked responses, increased receptive field sizes, and ongoing stimulus-independent activity; these changes probably underlie the allodynia, hyperalgesia, and spontaneous pain seen in patients. Central sensitization is maintained by continuing input from the periphery, but also modulated by descending controls, both inhibitory and facilitatory, from the midbrain and brainstem. The projections of sensitized spinal neurons to the brain, in turn, alter the processing of painful messages by higher centers. Several mechanisms contribute to central sensitization. Repetitive activation of primary afferent C fibers leads to a synaptic strengthening of nociceptive transmission. It may also induce facilitation of non-nociceptive Aβ fibers and nociceptive Aδ fibers, giving rise to dynamic mechanical allodynia and mechanical hyperalgesia. In postherpetic neuralgia and complex regional pain syndrome, for example, these symptoms are maintained and modulated by peripheral nociceptive input. Diagnosing central sensitization can be particularly difficult. In addition to the medical history, quantitative sensory testing and functional magnetic resonance imaging may be useful, but diagnostic criteria that include both subjective and objective measures of central augmentation are needed. Mounting evidence indicates that treatment strategies that desensitize the peripheral and central nervous systems are required. These should generally involve a multimodal approach, so that therapies may target the peripheral drivers of central sensitization and/or the central consequences.

### Quantifying cerebral contributions to pain beyond nociception [^112r7EYK]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Pain is widely thought to emerge from distributed brain networks whose inputs include sensory, affective and evaluative processes. Although Melzack'sinfluential 'body-self neuromatrix' framework for pain emphasized many processes beyond nociception — including expectancy, attention, anxiety, and personality — the 'neuromatrix' came to be increasingly identified with a set of regions that encode the intensity of nociceptive input. However, there has been sustained interest in the roles of other brain regions that have been commonly considered to be non-nociceptive, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), hippocampus, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc). These regions are often thought to play support roles, influencing pain by modulating activity in nociceptive circuits, but they may also play a central role in pain construction independent of nociceptive circuits. Several recent studies of chronic pain in animal models suggest that this is the caseand implicate the vmPFC, NAc and other regions in mediating pain-related behaviours independent of classic probes of nociceptive pain. Chronic pain appears to involve a shift away from classic nociceptive regions and towards a type of pain directly maintained in frontal-limbic networks, and new theories describe pain as an emergent phenomenon related to activity in large-scale networks that include non-nociceptive regions. It is therefore vital to gain an increasingly precise understanding of the roles of non-nociceptive brain regions in human pain.

Pain Receptors and Their Stimulation

Pain can be categorized into two main types: acute pain and chronic pain. Acute pain typically arises due to direct tissue damage and is often sharp and immediate.

Acute pain can be broken down into two distinct phases. In the initial phase, the brain sends signals to alert the body to a potential threat or injury, lasting several seconds. The subsequent phase, known as the subacute phase, involves the body's efforts to initiate protective mechanisms for tissue recovery, spanning hours or longer. The key factor distinguishing pain from nociception is the consciousness of the tissue-damaging stimulus. Nociception, involves specialized nerve fibers (nociceptors) that detect potential thermal, mechanical, or chemical stimuli. Sensory event perception denotes the transformation of these stimulus events into chemical tissue events, triggering the activation of afferent pathways. These afferent pathways generate sensations like pain (nociception), temperature (thermosensation), and touch (mechanoreception). Nociceptors serve as specialized primary afferent neurons responsible for transmitting noxious stimuli to the brain's higher centers. These receptors have free nerve endings found on cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia, with axons forming initial synapses with spinal cord cells and extending into the peripheral nervous system.

Nociceptors are categorized into two primary classes. The first comprises medium-threshold myelinated Aδ-fibers, which convey "first" or rapid pain signals with a diameter of 1–6 μm and a velocity of 5–36 m/s. Aδ-fibers function as both mechanical and thermal nociceptors. The second class consists of high-threshold unmyelinated C-fibers, responsible for "second" or slow pain transmission with a diameter of 0.2–1 μm and a velocity of 0.2–1 m/s. These C-fibers specifically serve nociceptive functions. Further subcategorization of Aδ-fibers reveals two main classes. Type I (HTM: high-threshold mechanical nociceptors) convey first pain responses to both chemical and mechanical stimuli but possess high heat thresholds (> 50). Type II Aδ-nociceptors exhibit much lower sensitivity to thermal stimulation but have notably high mechanical thresholds.

### A systematic review of neurophysiological sensing for the assessment of acute pain [^114JmLXH]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The appropriate management of pain is an essential element of care. This ethical duty to treat pain was highlighted by the Declaration of Montreal, which calls for "access to pain management as a fundamental human right". To support this ethical duty, there is a need to obtain an objective, reliable, and accurate physiologic marker of pain that can assist clinicians to establish the most beneficial treatment for patients in pain. The field of pain management would benefit enormously from further advancement in objective, physiologic markers of pain. To gain insight into how neurophysiological indicators can serve as valid measures of pain, it is important to understand the underlying mechanisms of how neurophysiological signals can be used to capture pain. To this end, we will discuss some of the most common aspects of the nervous system that provide insights into pain.

Aetiology of pain

In the event of painful stimuli on the body, pain is mediated by processing in the nervous system. The nervous system consists of two subsystems, the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system (CNS). The main function of the CNS is the integration and processing of sensory information in the body. The CNS consists of the brain and the spinal cord. Information regarding the effect of painful stimuli on the affected area (within the body or on extremities and trunk) is transported through the peripheral nervous system to the central and autonomic nervous systems by means of neural afferent pathways. This process, in which the brain is informed of actual or potential tissue damage, is known as nociception. It is worth noting that in most cases, nociceptive stimulation (e.g. bruises, cuts, fractures) leads to pain; however, pain (e.g. phantom limb pain) can occur in the absence of any noxious stimulation. In this regard, nociceptive pain is often acute and brief in duration, and originates in response to a sufficiently intense stimulus.

### The ACTTION-APS-AAPM pain taxonomy (AAAPT) multidimensional approach to classifying acute pain conditions [^111LtXwX]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Mechanism-Based

Similar to the AAPT chronic pain experience, it was hoped that the AAAPT could inform its dimensional constructs by mapping onto underlying pain mechanisms. As with chronic pain, it was agreed that the current understanding of acute pain mechanisms poorly differentiates between acute and chronic pain and is often insufficient to distinguish among many types of acute pain conditions. One of the foremost examples of such a failure is the intertwined nature of the pathophysiologic mechanisms (e.g. nociceptive, neuropathic, inflammatory, ischemic) contributing to acute pain. As each of these components is present in nearly all acute pain conditions, distinguishing among acute pain conditions according to their nociceptive, neuropathic, or inflammatory components is presently infeasible. A similar issue arises in considering biochemical mediators as current evidence suggests that acute and chronic disease states often display similar profiles of peripheral mediators.

Another approach to differentiate between acute and chronic pain, or among acute pain types, is to consider whether the mechanism of sensitization is peripheral or central. Although acute pain may initially involve prominent peripheral sensitization, it may also occur during chronic pain and therefore discourages reliance on the criterion of peripheral sensitization as a key differentiator between acute and chronic pain. On the other hand, central sensitization seems to play a larger role (and has been characterized more extensively) in chronic pain conditions but yet is evident in acute pain as well. Future research will be needed to better characterize the relative contributions of peripheral and central sensitization to the overall acute pain process — and its transition to chronic pain.

The presence and nature of tissue injury probably differentiates best between acute and chronic pain, as well as among different types of acute pain conditions. At the level of tissue injury, distinct profiles of injured structures, tissue-specific mediators, receptors, and responses may help differentiate acute pain conditions. For instance, the high affinity receptor (trkA) for the nociceptive mediator nerve growth factor (NGF) is expressed in notably higher levels in visceral bladder afferent vs cutaneous sensory afferents. Further, acute pain stemming from periosteal injury has distinct mechanisms, mediators, and transmission compared with acute pain stemming from cutaneous injury. While many examples of acute tissue injury involve damage to an array of tissues (post-traumatic or postsurgical models), other etiologies are more tissue specific. For example, acute neuropathic pain may be in part initiated by infectious and inflammatory injury, more specifically to neural structures such as dorsal root ganglion neurons. Similarly, certain types of acute pain are strongly associated with a particular anatomic location, for example, fracture or burn pain.

Chronic pain pathophysiology and impact is described as prolonged and intense exposure to nociceptive stimuli being thought to lead to changes in nociceptive processing through peripheral and central sensitization of nociceptive pathways. With chronic pain, brain centers involved in pain processing become more sensitized, emotional and cognitive factors become more prominent than sensory/nociceptive circuits, and psychological and social elements take on a greater role, serving as a vicious cycle and contributing to the persistence of pain. Central sensitization can lead to altered modulation of pain processing within the central nervous system (CNS) that leads to either increased excitability and/or reduced inhibition of specific neural networks leading to feelings of allodynia or hyperalgesia, and patients with chronic pain may also experience worsened quality of life (QoL), behavioral health, immune system function, physical function, sleep, employment status, and impaired personal relationships.

Introduction

The nervous system is an incredibly intricate portion of human anatomy that serves four major functions: motion, sensation, association, and control of homeostasis. It is broadly characterized into the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS); both of which play roles in pain pathways.

Pain systems are neural circuits responsible for the sensation and perception of pain, as well as the body's response to pain. They consist of peripheral neurons (primary afferent neurons) with sets of peripheral receptive elements (nociceptors) that connect in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord with central neuronal relay pathways (secondary afferent neurons) and integrative neurons that modulate nociceptive signals through excitatory or inhibitory influences at various levels of the neuraxis. Nociception encompasses four stages: transduction, transmission, modulation, and perception. During transduction, a physical or chemical stimulus is converted into an electrical signal that can then be transmitted. Transmission refers to the movement of this electrical activity through the nervous system. Modulation is the alteration of neuronal activity through the pathways of transmission. Lastly, perception is when somatosensory transmission results in the subjective experience of pain.

When there is traumatic injury and/or persistent inflammatory changes, this can affect the normal pain pathways, which can result in chronic pain. The progression from acute pain to a chronic pain state involves multilevel changes, including the primary sensory neuron, spinal cord, and brain. At the initial site of injury inflammatory mediators are secreted that stimulate nociceptor activity, this is sometimes referred to as the "Inflammatory soup". The "inflammatory soup" is made up of peptides, neurotransmitters, lipid, and neuropeptides that can either activate nociceptors or lower their threshold to activation leading to increased activation of the a-delta and c fibers and peripheral sensitization occurs.

### Neuropathic central pain… [^116DFuAy]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Evidence is reviewed that points to molecular changes in nociceptive terminals, ectopic firing of afferent pain fibers at the level of the dorsal root ganglia, and physiologic changes of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor that cause chronic nociceptive pain. Conclusions. Central sensitization is the physiologic manifestation of many severe peripherally induced pain states. It is maintained by nociceptive input and a physiologic change in the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. It consists of: hypersensitivity at the site of injury; mechanoallodynia; thermal hyperalgesia; hyperpathia; extraterritoriality in the case of complex regional pain syndrome/reflex sympathetic dystrophy; and associated neurogenic inflammation, autonomic dysregulation, and motor phenomena. NOCICEPTIVE central pain is an emerging concept.

1 It is well established that direct injury to the brain or spinal cord may be followed by pain but it is not generally realized that damage to peripheral nociceptive nerve endings in soft tissue, plexuses, or the nerves themselves also causes nociceptive central pain. The major clinical features of nociceptive central pain are hypersensitivity at the site of injury; mechanoallodynia; thermal hyperalgesia6; hyperpathia7; extraterritoriality in the case of complex regional pain syndrome/reflex sympathetic dystrophy8; and associated neurogenic inflammation, autonomic dysregulation, and motor phenomena that are especially found in complex regional pain syndrome/reflex sympathetic dystrophy.
9. Central sensitization is the pivotal physiologic phenomenon underlying the clinical symptoms of neuropathic central pain following peripheral nerve injury.

10 Central sensitization is primarily induced by the firing of unmyelinated nociceptive C-fibers that project to the superficial layers of the dorsal horn. 11 These fibers produce slow excitatory postsynaptic potentials that may last for up to 20 seconds. This sensitization is induced by neurotrophic factors, algesic molecules, leukotrienes, and cytokines released at the site of injury. 15 Sensitization of nociceptive terminals is responsible for a component of primary hyperalgesia of injured tissue, while the remainder is due to the hyperexcitability of CCPNs of the DH. 16.

In normal function, nociceptive fibers innervate peripheral tissues and form excitatory synapses onto secondary sensory neurons in superficial laminae of the dorsal horn. Within the dorsal horn, GABAergic interneurons organized in polysynaptic translaminar networks regulate nociceptive signals by inhibiting primary and secondary neurons. Functional downregulation of KCC2 activity is a major mechanism of spinal disinhibition and the development of neuropathic pain. The potassium –chloride cotransporter KCC2 uses the favorable outwardly directed electrochemical gradient of K+ across the plasma membrane to extrude Cl− from neurons. © 2025 Peripheral neuropathic pain, typified by the development of spontaneous pain or pain hypersensitivity following injury to the peripheral nervous system, is common, greatly impairs quality of life, and is inadequately treated with available drugs.

Maladaptive changes in chloride homeostasis due to a decrease in the functional expression of the potassium-chloride cotransporter KCC2 in spinal cord dorsal horn neurons are a major contributor to the central disinhibition of γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor– and glycine receptor–mediated signaling that characterizes neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain arises from persistent pathological changes in neurons anywhere in the nociceptive pathway that lower the threshold for activation. Peripheral nerves can become sensitized by changes in the expression and/or activity of ion channels that alter intrinsic membrane excitability. Altered processing of nociception in the central nervous system, ie, "central sensitization, " is also important3.

The loss of inhibitory GABAergic and glycinergic signaling within the dorsal horn is critical in this process, amplifying the response to incoming stimuli. Current treatments aim to inhibit neuronal excitability, activate the endogenous opioid system, antagonize enzymes responsible for pain fiber sensitization, or stimulate descending pain modulation systems. In peripheral neuropathic pain, there is a decrease in inhibitory signaling from GABAergic interneurons, which dysregulates nociceptive gating.
