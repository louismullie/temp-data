## Question

Hepatomegaly 20 cm

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and evaluate a 20 cm liver span, including whether this constitutes massive hepatomegaly, what the differential diagnosis is, and what the next diagnostic steps should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the measurement and its clinical significance. Then, I should verify the etiologic categories that explain massive enlargement. Next, I will prioritize the differential by likelihood and danger. After that, I need to outline a staged diagnostic workup, including when to image, what labs to order, and when to biopsy. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a practical plan with red flags and follow-up intervals.

> Let me first confirm the measurement and its meaning. A 20 cm liver span at the midclavicular line is unequivocally abnormal and represents massive hepatomegaly, well above the usual adult upper limit of about 15–16 cm and the threshold of 13 cm that raises concern for metastatic disease in oncology contexts, so I should not minimize this finding [^115KQAS5] [^1165PV5R]. Wait, let me verify the caveat: linear craniocaudal measurements can mislead because livers of similar height can have very different volumes, so I need to ensure we are not overcalling a long, thin liver as "massive" when volume is actually normal; volumetric assessment is more accurate when available [^114yW8ZF] [^112bmYhi].

> Next, I should review the pathophysiology to frame the differential. Massive hepatomegaly reflects increased cell number (hyperplasia, infiltration), increased cell size (hypertrophy, edema, steatosis), or increased extracellular matrix (fibrosis), and it is a sign rather than a disease, so I need to keep a broad differential and avoid anchoring too early [^116hNgdP]. Hold on, I should verify that massive enlargement is less often due to simple congestion or gallstone disease and more often due to infiltrative, neoplastic, or storage processes; that pattern is consistent with clinical experience and case-based literature [^114TeDKQ].

> I will now examine the major etiologic buckets. Let me think about infiltrative and neoplastic causes first because they commonly produce marked enlargement: hematologic malignancies such as CLL, lymphoma, and myelofibrosis with extramedullary hematopoiesis; solid organ metastases; and primary hepatic tumors including HCC and large benign lesions like hepatic adenoma or hemangioma can all present with substantial hepatomegaly, so I should keep these high on the list and correlate with symptoms and risk factors [^1165PV5R] [^113UCeW1] [^114pJ3Hy] [^115WGdFX]. But wait, what if the liver is diffusely enlarged without focal lesions? That pushes me toward infiltrative processes like amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, or storage diseases, which can also cause massive enlargement and systemic features [^116zyUJQ] [^114TeDKQ].

> I should also consider metabolic and storage diseases. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and diabetes-related hepatomegaly can enlarge the liver, though rarely to 20 cm unless there is severe steatosis or concomitant processes, so I need to check for metabolic risk factors and glycogen or lipid storage diseases, especially in younger patients or those with atypical features [^115Aq18i] [^114jWffu]. Hold on, I should verify that inborn errors of metabolism often present in infancy or early childhood with hepatomegaly and multiorgan involvement; that timing and pattern can be a key clue to pursue targeted testing or genetics when suspected [^114jWffu].

> Vascular and congestive causes can produce impressive enlargement, so I need to check for right-sided heart failure, tricuspid regurgitation, and Budd-Chiari syndrome. Budd-Chiari classically presents with abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, and ascites, and can be missed if I do not specifically evaluate the hepatic veins and IVC on imaging, so I should keep this in mind if there is abrupt onset or pain [^115db1w4]. Let me reconsider: if the patient has chronic heart failure or valvular disease, a pulsatile, tender liver with elevated JVP would support hepatic congestion, which can be quite large but typically has other stigmata of volume overload [^1176WAxY].

> Infectious etiologies can also enlarge the liver, though usually not to 20 cm unless the course is chronic or the host is immunocompromised. I should review risks for Q fever, tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacterial disease, and chronic viral hepatitis, and correlate with travel, animal exposures, and immune status, since granulomatous disease and chronic infections can produce hepatomegaly and systemic symptoms [^113Zz6aA] [^1178QTVz]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "hepatitis C is the most common cause of cirrhosis worldwide", but that is outdated; globally, hepatitis B remains more prevalent, and NAFLD is rising rapidly, so I should correct that assumption and tailor testing accordingly [^114Ub9Mb].

> I should double-check special populations and contexts. In pediatrics, normative liver size varies with age and body size, so a 20 cm liver would be extraordinary and should trigger evaluation for storage diseases, malignancy, or severe congestive or infiltrative processes; contemporary pediatric normative data and disease-specific guidance help avoid overcalling benign variants and direct timely workup [^115wvv2J] [^115yJQHk]. In cystic fibrosis, hepatomegaly is common and correlates with CF liver disease; annual exam with liver span measurement is recommended, and composite scores including liver and spleen size plus enzymes improve detection of microscopic injury, so I should apply CF-specific algorithms if relevant [^114zS6TR] [^115gtdGT]. In systemic mastocytosis, organomegaly including hepatomegaly enters B-findings and can signal higher mast cell burden, so I should look for systemic clues and tryptase if suspected [^116oVCFQ] [^113vryZN].

> Next, I should review the initial diagnostic workup. First, confirm the abnormality with imaging because palpation and percussion can misestimate size; ultrasound is a reasonable first step to verify span, assess echotexture, vascular patency, and splenic size, while recognizing that operator dependence and body habitus can limit accuracy for large livers [^114Ub9Mb]. Hold on, I should verify that for massive hepatomegaly, cross-sectional imaging with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI is often necessary to define morphology, detect focal lesions, characterize infiltrative disease, and evaluate hepatic veins and portal structures; this is especially true if ultrasound is nondiagnostic or if malignancy is suspected [^114Ub9Mb] [^115eET5w]. If a focal lesion is identified, I need to apply lesion-specific algorithms based on size, risk, and imaging features to decide between observation, contrast-enhanced imaging, or biopsy [^1156RfkD] [^114cTdZv].

> I need to ensure the laboratory evaluation is comprehensive and targeted. Core labs should include liver chemistries, bilirubin, albumin, INR, CBC with platelets, and viral hepatitis serologies; I should add iron studies with ferritin and transferrin saturation to screen for hemochromatosis, and consider autoimmune markers if cholestatic or hepatitic patterns emerge [^115PkWRv] [^1121kFZ4]. If infiltrative disease is suspected, I should check SPEP with immunofixation, free light chains, and consider ACE and angiotensin-converting enzyme for sarcoidosis; if amyloid is on the table, I should pursue tissue diagnosis and typing, given its prognostic and therapeutic implications [^116zyUJQ]. For suspected malignancy or persistent unexplained hepatomegaly, tumor markers such as AFP, CEA, and CA 19–9 can be informative, though they are not specific and must be interpreted in context [^114Ub9Mb].

> But wait, when should I proceed to liver biopsy? I should confirm that biopsy is indicated when noninvasive evaluation is inconclusive, when there is suspicion for infiltrative, granulomatous, or storage disease, or when malignancy cannot be excluded; in acute liver failure or when cancer is suspected, guidelines support tissue diagnosis to guide management [^115eET5w] [^113iKdyp]. I should also remember that in some cases, such as amyloidosis or systemic mastocytosis, extracutaneous organ involvement may be established by alternative tissues, so I need to coordinate with hematology or pathology to choose the safest and highest-yield site for biopsy [^116zyUJQ] [^113vryZN].

> I will now examine red flags that demand urgent action. Acute pain with new massive hepatomegaly suggests vascular events such as Budd-Chiari or hepatic infarction and warrants emergent imaging of the hepatic veins and IVC; failure to image venous outflow would be a mistake I should avoid [^115db1w4]. Rapidly enlarging liver with weight loss, night sweats, or jaundice raises concern for malignancy and should prompt expedited cross-sectional imaging and consideration of biopsy; markedly elevated AFP supports HCC but is not required for diagnosis, so I should not wait for AFP to rise if imaging is suspicious [^1129KUf9]. In children, massive hepatomegaly with failure to thrive, neurologic symptoms, or hypoglycemia should trigger evaluation for inborn errors of metabolism without delay [^114jWffu].

> Let me synthesize a practical, staged approach. Stage 1: confirm the size and characterize the liver with ultrasound, obtain core labs including hepatitis serologies, iron studies, CBC, and LFTs, and screen for metabolic risk factors; if ultrasound is limited or findings are concerning, proceed to contrast-enhanced CT or MRI to assess morphology, vasculature, and focal lesions [^114Ub9Mb] [^115PkWRv]. Stage 2: based on imaging and labs, pursue disease-specific testing such as SPEP, ACE, autoimmune panels, or tumor markers as indicated, and consider targeted biopsy if the etiology remains unclear or malignancy is suspected; coordinate multidisciplinary input for hematologic, oncologic, or metabolic diseases [^113iKdyp]. Stage 3: initiate disease-directed therapy and arrange follow-up imaging to document response; for example, in myelofibrosis, ruxolitinib reduces liver volume over time, and in ADPKD with PLD, symptom-driven cyst-reduction strategies can improve quality of life, so I should align treatment and monitoring with the underlying diagnosis and patient goals [^111M5xpm] [^111RaQiL].

> In summary, a 20 cm liver span is massive and abnormal; I should confirm with imaging, avoid premature anchoring, and systematically evaluate for infiltrative, neoplastic, metabolic, vascular, and infectious causes while prioritizing those that are treatable or life-threatening. If I catch myself assuming "fatty liver" because it is common, I should pause and verify that the degree of enlargement fits the usual NAFLD phenotype; when the story does not fit, I must escalate to cross-sectional imaging and tissue diagnosis to avoid missing curable or time-sensitive diseases [^116hNgdP] [^115eET5w].

A 20 cm liver span is **massive hepatomegaly** and far exceeds the normal adult range of 12–15 cm [^115KQAS5]. This degree of enlargement is **concerning for serious disease** such as malignancy (HCC, metastases, lymphoma), infiltrative or storage diseases (amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, Gaucher, Niemann-Pick), vascular congestion (Budd-Chiari, right heart failure), or severe chronic liver disease with regenerative nodules [^115WGdFX] [^116zyUJQ] [^114eeH56] [^115db1w4] [^114Ub9Mb]. Immediate evaluation with **contrast-enhanced CT or MRI** [^114Ub9Mb], comprehensive labs (CBC, LFTs, hepatitis serologies, AFP, metabolic panel), and targeted tests (iron studies, autoimmune panel, SPEP, HIV, TB) is essential [^115PkWRv]. Management is **cause-specific**, with urgent hepatology referral and biopsy if malignancy or infiltrative disease is suspected [^115eET5w].

Use **contrast-enhanced CT or MRI** to characterize lesions, assess vascular involvement, and guide biopsy [^111jDHpg]. Consider **elastography** to assess fibrosis and portal hypertension [^114qWT7H].

---

### Liver biopsy

Biopsy is indicated for **unexplained hepatomegaly**, suspected malignancy, or infiltrative disease [^115eET5w].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Malignancy**: surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, liver transplantation [^111VUtVm].
- **Infiltrative/storage diseases**: enzyme replacement therapy, supportive care, disease-specific treatments [^115RopqY].
- **Vascular/congestive**: anticoagulation, surgical intervention, management of underlying cardiac disease [^notfound].
- **Chronic liver disease**: lifestyle modification, medical management, liver transplantation [^notfound].

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies by **etiology**. Malignancy and advanced infiltrative disease carry poor outcomes, whereas benign or treatable causes have better prognoses with appropriate therapy [^notfound].

---

A 20 cm liver span is **massive hepatomegaly** and signals serious disease. Prompt, structured evaluation with imaging and labs, followed by cause-specific therapy, is essential to improve outcomes.

Cystic fibrosis hepatobiliary disease — abdominal physical examination screening: The CFF recommends annual abdominal physical examination for hepatosplenomegaly for identification of advanced liver disease in all people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF) starting at CF diagnosis, and there is a lack of objective evidence to recommend screening abdominal examination more frequently than annually in PwCF not known to have CFHBI or aCFLD. Persons with CFHBI and aCFLD may manifest hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly, with hepatomegaly reported in up to 30% of PwCF; physical exam correlated with biopsy showed a sensitivity and specificity of 60% and 44% for hepatomegaly and 93% and 57% for splenomegaly. During the examination, percussion and palpation of the entire liver and spleen with measurement of the liver span at the mid-clavicular line should be performed.

S2. The CFF recommends annual abdominal physical examination for hepatosplenomegaly for identification of advanced liver disease in all PwCF starting at CF diagnosis.

Persons with CFHBI and aCFLD may manifest abnormalities on physical exam. These include hepatomegaly, defined as enlargement of the liver span below the mid-clavicular line, and/or splenomegaly, defined as a palpable spleen on abdominal examination. Of these, hepatomegaly is the most commonwith some studies reporting this in up to 30% of PwCF. A study correlating physical exam with liver biopsy in CF reported a sensitivity and specificity of 60% and 44% for hepatomegaly and 93% and 57% for splenomegaly in the detection of aCFLD. While the specificity of abdominal examination is relatively low, it is noninvasive, easily repeatable, and requires minimal additional time and cost. During the examination, percussion and palpation of the entire liver and spleen with measurement of the liver span at the mid-clavicular line should be performed. One longitudinal study evaluated physical examination for hepatomegaly and splenomegaly in children with CF, finding an incremental detection of abnormalities through annual examination. There is a lack of objective evidence to recommend screening abdominal examination more frequently than annually in PwCF not known to have CFHBI or aCFLD.

### Fetal hepatomegaly: causes and associations [^116PA2BC]. Radiographics (2020). Medium credibility.

Fetal hepatomegaly is associated with significant fetal morbidity and mortality. However, hepatomegaly might be overlooked when numerous other fetal anomalies are present, or it might not be noticed when it is an isolated entity. As the largest solid organ in the abdomen, the liver can be seen well with US or MRI, and the normal imaging characteristics are well described. The length of the fetal liver, which can be used to identify hepatomegaly, can be determined by measuring the liver from the diaphragm to the tip of the right lobe in the sagittal plane. Fetal hepatomegaly is seen with infection, transient abnormal myelopoiesis, liver storage and deposition diseases, some syndromes, large liver tumors, biliary atresia, and anemia. Some of these diagnoses are treatable during the fetal period. Attention to the associated findings and specific hepatic and nonhepatic imaging characteristics can help facilitate more accurate diagnoses and appropriate patient counseling. © RSNA, 2020.

### Efficacy of ruxolitinib on hepatomegaly in patients with myelofibrosis [^111M5xpm]. Leukemia (2016). Low credibility.

Reduction of hepatomegaly would be a benefit of particular clinical significance for patients undergoing splenectomy, as most of these patients eventually develop symptomatic hepatomegaly. As COMFORT-I was not designed to evaluate liver volume reductions in patients who had undergone splenectomy, we cannot speculate about the efficacy of ruxolitinib in alleviating hepatomegaly in these patients. However, maximum liver size reductions of 50–68% (based on palpation) have been observed in three patients with symptomatic hepatomegaly (palpable length, 14–16 cm) and previous splenectomy who were treated with ruxolitinib in the phase II study.

Our study used volumetric liver size assessment based on magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scans to evaluate the treatment effect of ruxolitinib on liver size compared with placebo. A considerable advantage of this approach over palpation is that it allows for the greatest precision and accuracy in the quantitative measurement of liver size. However, because of substantial interindividual variability in healthy individuals, liver volume alone is not always a sufficient indicator of the degree of hepatomegaly. A recent study estimated the mean volume ± s.d. of enlarged livers at 2.32 ± 0.75 l compared with 1.51 ± 0.25 l for normal livers. This suggests that a majority of patients in COMFORT-I, including most, if not all, in the second, third and fourth baseline liver volume quartiles of the ruxolitinib arm had mild to massive hepatomegaly at baseline. Although liver volume reductions were observed across quartiles, the clinical significance of a 6–9% reduction in liver volume is limited by the lack of a corresponding patient-reported outcome measure to assess reduction in hepatomegaly-related symptoms. However, the correlations between reductions in spleen size and liver volume observed in this analysis along with previously published results showing a relationship between reductions in spleen volume and MF-related symptoms, and the correlations between liver volume and albumin and weight suggest that the reductions in hepatomegaly are clinically meaningful.

In conclusion, ruxolitinib provided significant reductions in liver volume compared with placebo in COMFORT-I. Liver volumes decreased rapidly during the first 12 weeks and continued to decrease through week 60, with benefit maintained with longer-term treatment. Percentage reductions in liver volume were associated with improvements in splenomegaly and metabolic status. Overall, these findings suggest that ruxolitinib may improve MF-related hepatomegaly.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^114TeDKQ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Typical of complex, ambiguous cases in the early stage, the clinician appropriately considers a very broad differential diagnosis. Three categories — infection, autoimmune conditions and malignancy — provide structure for thinking through this case. The clinician uses the patient's age, gender and significant travel history to help focus the extensive differential diagnosis in each category. The problem representation is now: a 43-year-old woman with acute, unremitting LUQ pain and a subacute history of night sweats, weight loss and recent travel to Mexico.

She was in moderate distress due to abdominal pain. Her temperature was 38.1°C, blood pressure 96/43 mmHg, heart rate 125 beats per minute and respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. She had scleral icterus. Lung and heart exams were normal except for tachycardia. The abdomen was nondistended with normal bowel sounds, but diffusely tender, particularly in the LUQ. Liver span was 15 cm to percussion, and the spleen was not palpable. She had no peritoneal signs or costovertebral angle tenderness, and a pelvic examination was normal. Her neurological and skin examinations were normal.

Her appearance and vital signs suggest the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which requires prompt evaluation, stabilization and usually empiric antibiotic treatment. Jaundice, fever and abdominal pain prioritize acute bacterial cholangitis as an immediate concern, despite the uncertainty surrounding the nature of the subacute underlying illness. Hepatomegaly is typically explained by liver inflammation, infiltration or congestion. Massive enlargement is usually caused by an infiltrative process and is not seen in gallstone-related illnesses.

There is discordance between the presence of jaundice and hepatomegaly and the persistent LUQ pain. Plausible explanations include primary hepatic diseases with acute portal hypertension and splenic congestion; a left-sided intra-abdominal infection or malignancy (e.g. diverticulitis or colon cancer) spreading to the liver via the portal circulation; or a single malignant (e.g. lymphoma), infectious (e.g. endocarditis) or infiltrative (e.g. sarcoidosis) process simultaneously affecting the liver and spleen (or another left-sided abdominal organ).

Cystic fibrosis liver disease (CFLD) definitions — published criteria are summarized across multiple sources. Colombo 2002 considers CFLD if at least 2 conditions are present on at least 2 consecutive examinations spanning a 1-year period, including clinical hepatomegaly with the liver edge palpable more than 2 cm below the costal margin and abnormal serum liver enzyme levels consisting of elevation above the upper normal limits of 2 of AST, ALT, and GGT, or ultrasound abnormalities other than hepatomegaly. Debray 2011 states diagnosis of CFLD should be considered if 2 or more categories are present, including hepatomegaly > 2 cm below the costal margin and increased transaminases and GGT in at least 3 consecutive determinations over 12 months. Flass 2013 includes persistent AST, ALT, GGT > 2 times upper limit of normal.

### Efficacy of ruxolitinib on hepatomegaly in patients with myelofibrosis [^113q5kpj]. Leukemia (2016). Low credibility.

We sought to determine whether the percentage changes in liver volume in the ruxolitinib arm were affected by baseline liver volume. Patients in the first (n = 37), second (n = 35), third (n = 36) and fourth (n = 31) quartile had median (range) baseline liver volumes of 1929 cm³ (1268–2115 cm³), 2323 cm³ (2131–2483 cm³), 2661 cm³ (2488–3014 cm³) and 3417 cm³ (3028–4833 cm³), respectively. Patients experienced similar reductions in hepatomegaly at week 24 regardless of baseline liver volume, with mean ± s.d. percentage changes in liver volume of −8.3% ± 7.9%, −6.4% ± 7.5%, −7.8% ± 8.6% and −9.1% ± 8.8% in the first, second, third and fourth quartile, respectively. Changes in liver volume over time observed for the entire study population were reflected in each quartile (Figure 1d). Although the mean values for each quartile showed some differences after week 60, the interpatient variability in each quartile (represented by the standard error) was greater than the interquartile variability of the means.

Percentage changes in liver volume at week 24 significantly correlated with changes in splenomegaly, both for the entire evaluable population (n = 138; R² = 0.3062; Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) = 0.5534; P < 0.0001; Figure 2) and for patients with both baseline liver and spleen volumes in the third or fourth quartile (n = 44; R² = 0.2284; PCC = 0.4779; P = 0.0010). Nearly all patients who experienced a liver volume reduction also had a spleen volume reduction (Figure 2). Significant negative correlations were observed between changes in liver volume at week 24 and corresponding changes in body weight (R² = 0.0446; PCC = −0.2111; P = 0.0129), leptin (R² = 0.1036; PCC = −0.3219; P = 0.0001) and albumin (R² = 0.0472; PCC = −0.2172; P = 0.0102). Increases in these parameters were observed in most patients who had a decrease in liver volume (Supplementary Figure S1).

Abnormalities in liver morphology

Hepatomegaly

Hepatomegaly is defined as abnormal diffuse enlargement of the liver. Imaging diagnosis of hepatomegaly is mainly based on subjective evaluation supplemented by lineal craniocaudal measurement (e.g. craniocaudal diameter of the liver in midclavicular line of ≥ 15.5 cm). However, unidimensional measurement cannot accurately reflect liver volume, and a consensus on the threshold of hepatomegaly is still lacking. Hepatomegaly in PBCs is thought to be associated with diffuse intrahepatic cholestasis, hepatocyte edema, degeneration, and massive inflammatory cell infiltration. Approximately 11–50% of patients with PBC present hepatomegaly, with the exact percentage tending to decrease with increasing stage of the disease.

Liver surface nodularity

The liver margin in patients with PBC can be smooth or nodular (with nodules of < 3 cm). The configuration of the liver margin is correlated with the size of the underlying regenerative nodules. Gerald et al. reported that 64% of patients with cirrhosis caused by PBC presented with nodular liver margins, and 36% presented with smooth liver margins. However, lobulated liver margins (with more than one nodule > 3 cm) are not seen in PBC. The presence of liver surface nodularity was correlated with advanced stages of the disease and can be used for differentiating stage I–II and stage III–IV fibrosis in PBC.

Liver lobe redistribution

Lobal redistribution in PBC might be correlated with altered segmental portal venous perfusion, although the exact mechanism is still not fully understood. Segmental atrophy often appears when the disease progresses to late cirrhosis. Atrophy is only seen in 36% of patients with cirrhosis caused by PBC (half with diffuse atrophy and half with segmental atrophy), which is different to that of viral-induced cirrhosis, and focal atrophy of the left medial segment and right anterior segment is uncommon. Previous studies have reported that segmental hypertrophy was common in PBC patients with stage IV fibrosis but less frequent in those with advanced cirrhosis. In PBC-induced cirrhosis, segmental hypertrophy (most common in the left lateral segment and the caudate lobe) is found more frequently than diffuse hypertrophy (56% vs. 12%).

Hepatic adenoma is an uncommon benign lesion of the liver that occurs more frequently in women in their third and fourth decades. The female/male ratio is up to 11:1. Hepatic adenomas may be single or multiple occasionally reaching sizes up to 20 cm. They are non-cancerous lesions, however they can become malignant. We present a 21-year-old male patient with no medical history who presented with abdominal pain, a palpable abdominal mass, abnormal liver function tests and a 14 kg weight loss in a 2-year period. A CT scan was performed with a 17 cm tumour compressing intrahepatic bile ducts. The patient underwent a right hepatectomy with no complications. Histopathological analysis of the tumour revealed a hepatic adenoma with central necrosis. The patient is asymptomatic at 1-year follow-up.

### Advances in radionuclide therapies for patients with neuro-endocrine tumors [^111GMWc7]. Current Oncology Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

As illustrated by the post-hoc analysis of the NETTER-1 trial, progression free survival (PFS) following PRRT is significantly shorter in patients suffering from "bulky" liver disease (defined as having a lesion > 3 cm maximum diameter), which was present in approximately 70% of patients. Furthermore, patients can experience residual hormone related complaints following PRRT, assumed to be caused by liver metastases, bypassing the "filtration" of the liver. Therefore, combining systemic and local radionuclide treatments seems logical, gaining systemic control with PRRT whilst reducing prognostic significant liver disease (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
A 45-year-old, female patient with a grade 2 (ki67 7%) small intestinal NET (ileal origin), with a mesenteric mass, lymph node metastases and extensive bulky liver disease. Refractory to first-line SSA (continues flushing and diarrhea), referred for PRRT. A baseline [68 Ga]Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT. B [68 Ga]Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT 4 months after 4 cycles of PRRT, 7.4 GBq/cycle, with limited tumor reduction (RECIST 1.1 stable disease) and no improvement of complaints. 6 months after last PRRT cycle, received additional sequential whole liver 166 Ho-SIRT. C [68 Ga]Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT 3 months after additional 166 Ho-SIRT, additional tumor reduction (partial response according to RECIST 1.1) and resolution of flushing and diarrhea (with concurrent long-acting SSA, additional short-acting SSA was stopped).

### Hepatomegaly… [^116hNgdP]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Key Points Hepatomegaly results from increase in the number or size of cells in the liver. Liver span correlates more strongly with hepatomegaly than projection below the costal margin. As a sign, not itself a disease, hepatomegaly can result from broad categories of disorders with an extensive differential diagnosis.

### AASLD practice guidance on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma [^1129KUf9]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

AASLD HCC surveillance recall — ultrasound and AFP triggers state that US-2 can be safely observed with repeat short-interval surveillance using ultrasound and AFP in 3–6 months for lesions < 1 cm, and if the liver lesion remains stable on two or more follow-up ultrasound exams the patient can return to semiannual surveillance. Visualization limitations (LI-RADS visualization scores B or C) may be observed in ~20% of patients, and severe visualization limitations (LI-RADS visualization score C) are associated with lower sensitivity and may warrant other surveillance strategies, such as MRI. Patients with a new or enlarging solid liver lesion ≥ 1 cm on ultrasound (US-3) and those with elevated AFP independent of ultrasound results have a high risk of HCC and should undergo diagnostic imaging with multiphase CT or contrast-enhanced MRI. An AFP cutoff of 20 ng/ml provides a sensitivity of ~60% and specificity of ~90% and is the most common threshold for HCC surveillance, and patients with rising AFP on two consecutive tests or doubling of AFP levels may also warrant diagnostic imaging. For markedly elevated AFP (e.g. AFP ≥ 200 ng/ml) without a liver mass on diagnostic abdominal imaging, repeat abdominal imaging with an alternative modality and dedicated imaging of the chest and pelvis may be considered.

Case Report

A 39‐year‐old white man was referred for a diagnosis of aplastic anemia. His mother had anemia and cirrhosis and died of colon cancer at age 43, and his sister had an unclear blood dyscrasia and died at age 40. The patient had gray hair, but an otherwise unremarkable physical examination.

Abdominal computed tomography (CT; Fig. 1A, B) identified ascites, splenomegaly, and a small, nodular liver suspicious for cirrhosis. His liver volume (Fig. 1C) was 1,148 cm³, which was 51% of expected (2,229 cm³) based on height (1.88 m) and weight (109.3 kg). Hemodynamic analysis showed a hepatic venous pressure gradient of 13 mm Hg, consistent with portal hypertension. He had normal liver function tests and negative hepatitis serologies. Liver biopsy revealed LCC of 40%‐50% of hepatocytes (Fig. 2A, B). Ten percent of hepatocytes were binucleated, and occasional cells contained more than two nuclei (Fig. 2C). Only minimal‐to‐focal mild portal mononuclear inflammation was observed. Trichrome staining (Fig. 2D) revealed mild portal and periportal fibrosis without nodularity or cirrhosis.

### Hepatomegaly and diabetes… [^115Aq18i]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The liver frequently is increased in size in diabetics. This has been recognized for many years. In fact, special attention was called to this phenomenon in children with severe uncontrolled diabetes mellitus as long ago as 1938. 1 More recently, Goodman2 found that 21 of 45 diabetics with hepatomegaly had an insulin defficiency as evidenced by poorly regulated diabetes or acidosis; 13 were obese and only mildly diabetic, and 11 had a lipotropic deficiency as determined by their dietary history. Histological examinations have shown that the increase in the size of the liver is due to fatty deposits, not to glycogen, and control of the diabetes causes disappearance of the hepatomegaly, thus suggesting that the underlying cause of the hepatomegaly is poor diabetic control and not a lack of choline or other derivatives of raw pancreatic tissue. Goodman now finds that, because the liver may be palpable without being HEPATOMEGALY AND DIABETES. JAMA. 1954;

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) with polycystic liver disease (PLD) — indications and selection for therapy specify that people with ADPKD and PLD should receive treatment (i.e., medical and/or surgical including minimally invasive therapies) if they experience cyst-related symptoms or complications that negatively impact their quality of life (QoL). Determination of treatment type should be based on symptoms, liver cyst characteristics, total liver volume (TLV), and treatment availability, and given that symptoms in PLD often correlate with the extent of cystic enlargement and hepatomegaly, treatments usually seek to reduce cyst volume and hepatomegaly. This goal can be achieved through pharmacologic, interventional radiology, and surgical means, depending on cyst characteristics and the availability of expertise at the medical center.

### An unexpected finding of hepatosplenomegaly in a pediatric patient [^114eeH56]. Clinical Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

An ultrasound of her abdomen demonstrated an elongated spleen of 16 cm and liver of 14 cm. Parenchymal echogenicity of the liver and spleen were satisfactory. Color Doppler studies did not detect any hemodynamic lesions. As seen in Figure 1, the differential diagnosis for hepatosplenomegaly is broad.

Figure 1.
Approach to hepatosplenomegaly in pediatric patient.

Abbreviations: EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; CMV, cytomegalovirus; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus.

As such, initial laboratory investigations were performed in the Paediatric Liver Clinic (Table 1). An infectious screen revealed a negative heterophile antibody test and nonreactive hepatitis A, B, and C serology. An immunological liver workup revealed normal immunoglobulins, C3 and C4, antinuclear antibody, anti-double stranded DNA, anti-MPO, anti-PR3, α-1-antitrypsin, and ceruloplasmin. Hematological investigations including hemoglobin electrophoresis, Coomb's test, and G6PD deficiency screen were also negative. An α-fetoprotein level was also unremarkable. Metabolic storage disease was suspected, and testing revealed low leukocyte β-glucocerebrosidase activity and high plasma chitotriosidase activity (Table 1). In the context of hepatosplenomegaly, bony pain, easy bruising, and occasional epistaxis, we made a diagnosis of GD Type 1.

Table 1.
Laboratory Investigations.

The patient was referred to the Paediatric Metabolic Genetics team for further assessment. DNA sequencing of GBA identified 2 pathogenic variants, c.1226A > G and c.116_1505 deletion, confirming a diagnosis of GD Type 1. The c.1226A > G p.(N 409S; also known as N370S) is a common pathogenic variant. The c.116_1505 deletion is a novel deletion that spans exons 3 to 11 of GBA. A whole-body magnetic resonance imaging was performed to assess for bony abnormalities and identified mild femoral Erlenmeyer flask deformities bilaterally.

### Evaluation of laboratory and sonographic parameters for detection of portal hypertension in patients with common variable immunodeficiency [^114he6ob]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Timely detection of portal hypertension as a manifestation in a subgroup of patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) represents a challenge since it is usually not associated with liver cirrhosis. To identify relevant markers for portal hypertension, we evaluated clinical history, laboratory parameters, and abdominal ultrasound including liver elastography and biomarkers of extracellular matrix formation. Twenty seven (6%) of 479 CVID patients presented with clinically significant portal hypertension as defined by either the presence of esophageal varices or ascites. This manifestation occurred late during the course of the disease (11.8 years after first diagnosis of CVID) and was typically part of a multiorgan disease and associated with a high mortality (11/27 patients died during follow up). The strongest association with portal hypertension was found for splenomegaly with a longitudinal diameter of > 16 cm. Similarly, most patients presented with a liver stiffness measurement (LSM) of above 6.5 kPa, and a LSM above 20 kPa was always indicative of manifest portal hypertension. Additionally, many laboratory parameters including Pro-C4 were significantly altered in patients with portal hypertension without clearly increasing the discriminatory power to detect non-cirrhotic portal hypertension in CVID. Our data suggest that a spleen size above 16 cm and an elevated liver stiffness above 6.5 kPa should prompt further evaluation of portal hypertension and its sequelae, but earlier and better liquid biomarkers of this serious secondary complication in CVID are needed.

### Normal sonographic liver and spleen dimensions in a central European pediatric population [^115wvv2J]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Abdominal ultrasound is routinely used in pediatric patients in the investigation of many diseases and to measure and monitor normal organ growth. The size of the liver and spleen can provide important clues about the presence of certain pathologies. Accordingly, referring clinicians frequently ask for liver and spleen size, even though the sonographic measurement of liver size in particular has certain limitations.

Organ size is influenced by a number of factors. Age, height, weight, body surface area and ethnicity are known influencing factors and has been well documented for the kidneys. Hence, charts using local data are considered the most appropriate for a given population.

With changes in nutrition and disease profiles, pediatric populations have also changed over time, puberty beginning earlier resulting in a changing growth pattern of their organs. The average age of menarche in girls declined over the past century from an average age of 16–17 years to 12–13 years. American boys reach puberty 6 months to 2 years earlier than just a few decades ago. Therefore, the use of contemporary charts is important. The timing of puberty also differs between ethnicities. African American boys commence puberty the earliest, at around 9 years of age, while Caucasians and Hispanic boys commencing on average at age 10 years. This further emphasizes the importance of using charts based on data from the same ethnicity.

Only a limited number of contemporary studies of normative sonographic liver size in children have been published and include a Turkish population aged 0–16 years in 1998, a Brazilian population aged 0–7 years in 2009, an Indian population aged 0–12 years in 2010, a Nepalese population aged 0–15 years in 2014 and a second Nepalese population aged 0–15 years in 2015. Sonographic charts for liver size for a predominantly Caucasian population are limited. To our knowledge, only one such study exists, published in 1983 with 194 German children aged 0–18 years.

The lack of contemporary normative charts has implications for clinical practice: At our pediatric hospital in Central Europe with predominantly Caucasian patients, using the available reference charts, we have found a high frequency of hepatomegaly in the absence of other findings of liver disease. This may lead to unnecessary hepatological and/or hematological consultations and laboratory tests, with associated unnecessary cost and uncertainty for the affected families.

The aim of this study was to define a contemporary normative range of liver and spleen sizes for a predominantly Caucasian population and for all pediatric age groups (0–18 years) in correlation with age, height, weight and body surface. We also investigated the influence of gender.

AASLD hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance recall algorithm — surveillance using ultrasound (US) plus alpha fetoprotein (AFP) every 6 months proceeds as follows: Vis score A with no lesion on US and AFP normal leads to repeat US; Vis score B or lesion < 1 cm on US and AFP normal prompts follow-up ultrasound in 3–6 months; Vis score C (with no lesion or lesion < 1 cm on US) directs to screening contrast-enhanced MRI or multi-phasic CT, and repeat ultrasound can be considered for some patients; and if there is a lesion ≥ 1 cm on US, or AFP ≥ 20 ng/mL, or AFP increasing, the pathway directs to diagnostic contrast-enhanced multi-phasic MRI or CT. After diagnostic imaging, the pathway includes branches for no liver lesion but significantly elevated AFP, which directs to an alternative CT/MRI imaging modality +/− chest and pelvic CT, and for a liver lesion, which directs to the diagnostic CT/MRI LI-RADS figure; when no liver lesion and low AFP level are present, the pathway returns to US surveillance.

The radiological descriptions of the index lesion(s) were similar between the two groups.

Data on size of largest lesion on index scan was available in 93 patients. HCC was found in 10 (20%) of 49 patients where the largest lesion was ≥ 1 cm compared to 7 patients (16%) of 44 patients with a largest lesion of < 1 cm, although there was not a significant association between HCC and lesion size of ≥ 1 cm on univariate regression analysis (Table 2). In contrast, in the 20 patients where the largest lesion was ≥ 2 cm, HCC occurred in 3 (15%), compared to 14 (19%) of the 73 patients with a lesion < 2 cm in diameter. Again, this association was not significant on univariate regression analysis. The most common aetiology in those who developed HCC was CHC (53%), followed by ArLD (21%) and CHB (11%). There were no cases in which the underlying aetiology was non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Twenty six percent of patients with CHC, 14% with CHB and 40% with ArLD developed HCC, however these rates were not significantly different between groups. In the cohort that did not develop HCC from indeterminate lesions during follow up, CHC was also the most common aetiology (32%), followed by CHB in 13%, ArLD in 7%, NAFLD in 7% and hepatitis B and D virus co-infection in 7%. Although only two patients had a recorded diagnosis of CLD due to both CHC and alcohol (one of whom developed HCC), of the six patients with a diagnosis of CHC reporting alcohol use of more than 14 units / week, four developed HCC. Of the four patients with a diagnosis of CHC consuming > 21 units / week, two developed HCC.

### Assessing hepatomegaly: automated volumetric analysis of the liver [^112bmYhi]. Academic Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

The aims of this study were to define volumetric nomograms for identifying hepatomegaly and to retrospectively evaluate the performance of radiologists in assessing hepatomegaly.

Materials and Methods

Livers were automatically segmented from 148 abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scans: 77 normal livers and 71 cases of hepatomegaly (diagnosed by visual inspection and/or linear liver height by radiologists). Quantified liver volumes were compared to manual measurements using volume overlap and error. Liver volumes were normalized to body surface area, from which hepatomegaly nomograms were defined (H scores) by analyzing the distribution of liver sizes in the healthy population. H scores were validated against consensus reports. The performance of radiologists in diagnosing hepatomegaly was retrospectively evaluated.

Results

The automated segmentation of livers was robust, with volume overlap and error of 96.2% and 2.2%, respectively. There were no significant differences (P > .10) between manual and automated segmentation for either the normal or the hepatomegaly subgroup. The average volumes of normal and enlarged livers were 1.51 ± 0.25 and 2.32 ± 0.75 L, respectively. One-way analysis of variance found that body surface area (P = 0.004) and gender (P = 0.02), but not age, significantly affected normal liver volume. No significant effects were observed for two-way and three-way interactions among the three variables (P > .18). H-score cutoffs of 0.92 and 1.08 L/m² were used to define mild and massive hepatomegaly (95% confidence interval, ± 0.02 L/m²). Using the H score as the reference standard, the sensitivity of radiologists in detecting all, mild, and massive hepatomegaly was 84.4%, 56.7%, and 100.0% at 90.1% specificity, respectively. Radiologists disagreed on 20.9% of the diagnosed cases (n = 31). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of the H-score criterion for hepatomegaly detection was 0.98.

Conclusions

Nomograms for the identification and grading of hepatomegaly from automatic volumetric liver assessment normalized to body surface area (H scores) are introduced. H scores match well with clinical interpretations for hepatomegaly and may improve hepatomegaly detection compared with height measurements or visual inspection, commonly used in current clinical practice.

This article is only available in the PDF format. Download the PDF to view the article, as well as its associated figures and tables. To the Editor. Hepatic friction rubs have been described in patients with primary and secondary tumors of the liver, liver abscess, syphilitic hepatitis, gonococcal perihepatitis, and after biopsy. We have recently observed a loud hepatic friction rub in a 39-year-old woman with Behçet syndrome and erythroleukemia. This patient had massive hepatomegaly, with the liver edge felt at the level of the iliac crest. The liver was diffusely tender to palpation, and she had right upper quadrant pain associated with respiratory movements and general body movements. The spleen tip was felt at the umbilicus, but no rub was heard over the left abdomen. A friction rub was heard on the third day of her admission, well localized over the lateral aspect of the right lobe of the liver. This persisted until her death one week later.

At autopsy, no fibrinous exudate was apparent on the liver surface and there Wiener SL, Rai K. Hepatic Friction Rub. JAMA. 1976;

### Four cases of fetal hypoechoic hepatomegaly associated with trisomy 21 and transient abnormal myelopoiesis [^116NJKUY]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Our objective was to determine the clinical significance of fetal hypoechoic hepatomegaly and serial change of liver sizes.

Methods

The liver sizes of four fetuses with hypoechoic hepatomegaly were serially estimated by liver length, as measured from the dome of the right hemidiaphragm to the tip of the right lobe.

Results

All cases were associated with trisomy 21 or transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM). Two cases were trisomy 21 with TAM, one case was a phenotypically normal newborn, who had developed TAM during the fetal period, and the last case was trisomy 21 without TAM. In the last case, it is speculated that TAM had developed and regressed completely before birth. Two cases, whose hepatomegaly had improved before birth, showed good prognosis and the other two cases, in whom improvement had not been observed, resulted in death after birth by liver failure.

Conclusion

These experiences show that one of the differential diagnoses of hypoechoic hepatosplenomegaly is TAM and that the change of live size is a predictor of prognosis.

### Sonography of diffuse liver disease [^1172mA3H]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Sonography is often the first imaging procedure performed in the evaluation of individuals with suspected liver disease. Evaluation for biliary dilatation is always performed, because bile duct obstruction can cause abnormal liver test results, raising the suspicion of liver disease. Ultrasound is a useful but imperfect tool in evaluating diffuse liver disease. We discuss the uses and limitations of sonography in evaluating parenchymal liver disease. Sonography can show hepatomegaly, fatty infiltration of the liver, and cirrhosis, all with good but imperfect sensitivity and specificity. Sonography is of limited usefulness in acute hepatitis. Increased parenchymal echogenicity is a reliable criterion for diagnosing fatty liver. Cirrhosis can be diagnosed in the correct clinical setting when the following are present: a nodular liver surface, decreased right lobe-caudate lobe ratio, and indirect evidence of portal hypertension (collateral vessels and splenomegaly). Ultrasound plays an important role in the imaging of conditions and procedures common in patients with diffuse liver disease.

### Defects in myosin VB are associated with a spectrum of previously undiagnosed low γ-glutamyltransferase cholestasis [^116RgHon]. Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

P2 and P4 had single bouts of cholestasis that resolved (transient rather than recurrent cholestasis, at least to date), without recognized triggers. P2 only received UDCA for less than 1 week, switching to methylprednisolone at his parents' discretion. Interestingly, P2, differed from his elder brother P1, carrying the same MYO5B mutations, in showing normalized serum bilirubin and other liver function tests 3 weeks later (age 20 months) through to last follow‐up in January 2016 (age 4.4 years; Table 2). P4 had onset of cholestasis from 2 days old with hepatosplenomegaly (liver 3 cm below right costal arch and spleen 2 cm below left costal arch), but, after nearly 1 year of routine UDCA therapy with cholestyramine, he recovered with normal height and weight and mild hepatomegaly (2 cm below right costal arch; seefor laboratory values and management).

P6, P7, and P9 could not be classified as transient or recurrent cholestasis because of insufficient clinical follow‐up.

### Diagnosis and management of infantile hemangioma [^116MXzyg]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Hepatic involvement risk markers in infantile hemangioma — Multifocal cutaneous IHs are frequently isolated to the skin but may also serve as markers for underlying hepatic involvement. Previous retrospective reports suggested that the presence of a large or segmental (> 5 cm) cutaneous IH might prove a useful marker for hepatic IHs, but a large prospective study suggests that the number of cutaneous IHs is more predictive than size. When 5 or more IHs are present on cutaneous examination, ultrasonography may be helpful in assessing potential hepatic involvement, and hepatomegaly and congestive heart failure also suggest the presence of liver IH. The presence of more than 5 focal IHs suggests a higher risk of hepatic involvement.

### Incidental liver findings on cross-sectional imaging [^112ecccF]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Hepatic incidental findings often are seen on cross-sectional imaging examinations of the chest, spine, pelvis, or other nondedicated hepatic imaging. Radiologists are tasked with appropriately triaging, which requires further evaluation, even in the setting of an otherwise limited evaluation. This article reviews common benign entities encountered on ultrasound, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging, along with their characteristic imaging features. Imaging features that are suspicious for malignancy or suggest the need for further evaluation also are discussed. Two algorithms are proposed to guide radiologists in their recommendations based on patient risk factors, focal hepatic abnormality size, and available imaging features.

### An observational study of children with sickle cell disease in kilifi, Kenya [^114q5hqB]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

Clinical findings

Patients reported symptoms of illness on 130 of 583 (22%) clinic visits (Table I). There was no difference in overall frequency of symptoms at different ages (χ² = 9.909, P = 0.194). Forty-one of 124 patients (33%) had clinically detectable splenomegaly and 25 (20%) had hepatomegaly. While both were found in all age groups, the peak prevalence for both occurred in the 6–8 year age group where 44% of patients had splenomegaly and 30% had hepatomegaly (Fig 2). Among children with a palpable spleen, the median splenic size was 3 cm below the costal margin (range 1–10 cm). In those with a palpable liver the median liver size was 2 cm (range 1–5 cm). The largest mean spleen size of 4.8 cm was seen in the 8- to 10-year age-group, and the largest mean liver size of 4.0 cm was seen in the 0- to 2-year age-group. However, overall there were no significant relationships between spleen or liver sizes and age (P = 0.065 and 0.672 respectively). In addition there was no relationship between splenic size and the number of episodes of malaria (P = 0.072), malaria parasitaemia (P = 0.704) or use of proguanil (χ² = 3.083, P = 0.798). One hundred and fourteen of 124 (92%) patients reported being compliant with folic acid and proguanil prophylaxis. Bone or joint abnormalities, including swelling and tenderness, were found on 23 of 583 occasions (4%). A cardiac murmur was heard on 11 occasions (2%) (never in the same patient more than once) while skin infections were found on two occasions.

### Portal hypertensive bleeding in cirrhosis: risk stratification, diagnosis, and management: 2016 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^113CZ8zt]. Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) — diagnostic standards and noninvasive markers are summarized as follows: HVPG measurement is the gold-standard method to assess the presence of CSPH, defined as an HVPG ≥ 10 mm Hg. CSPH can be identified by noninvasive tests: LS > 20–25 kPa, alone or combined with platelet count and spleen size, and the presence of portosystemic collaterals on imaging is sufficient to diagnose CSPH; patients with GEV on endoscopy have, by definition, CSPH. Most studies have shown that the best LS cutoff to detect CSPH is > 20–25 kilopascals (kPa), with a diagnostic accuracy over 90%, and in a prospective study, HVPG ≥ 10 mm Hg and LS ≥ 21 kPa were equally effective in predicting decompensation. In a large study, an LSPS (liver stiffness [in kPa] × spleen size [in cm]/platelet count [in number/mm³] score) ≥ 2.06 was 90% specific in ruling in CSPH with a positive predictive value of > 90%, and a sequential strategy considered LS with the presence of any ultrasound abnormality and/or a platelet count < 150,000/mm³ to identify patients with CC more likely to have CSPH. For spleen stiffness (SS), SS > 54 kPa was better than LS and similar to HVPG in predicting first clinical decompensation in one study, but SS measurements by TE cannot be recommended in clinical practice.

### Value of assessing liver enlargement as a group a parameter in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) clinical trials: retrospective review of data from multiple trials for incidence of liver enlargement and impact on response assessment… [^1165PV5R]. ASCO (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract e19517 Background: iwCLL 2018 criteria defines liver enlargement as one of the important group A parameters for staging and overall response assessment. However, the authors acknowledge that given the impact of numerous medical conditions, liver size by physical examination or CT scan is not a reliable measure of hepatic involvement by CLL and should only be considered if hepatomegaly is clearly attributable to lymphoid involvement. The criteria even define partial response and progression categories as 50% decrease or increase, respectively, but no specific size or other criteria for assessing lymphoid involvement are proposed. Focal lesions in liver may be a sign of involvement by CLL but are assessed separately, as extranodal disease. Hepatomegaly may be non-specific with possible causes including metabolic, infectious, neoplastic, toxic, hereditary, vascular, and miscellaneous other causes.

20–30% of a general population may have non-alcoholic fatty liver enlargement. In the literature hepatomegaly by palpation has been defined as a portion of the liver below the costal margin and the cut-off for normal liver on imaging is considered < 16 cm in mid-clavicular line. However, there are various anatomic variations with no consensus on the size criteria for liver enlargement. The data were analyzed for the incidence of subjects with liver enlargement at baseline, post-BL assessment of liver and its impact on ORA. Liver assessment in all trials was qualitative, and the criteria for enlargement was based on the reviewer's judgement; no size limit was defined. Results: Only 7 out of 2223 subjects had liver enlargement at baseline. Liver assessment of these subjects at post-BL did not cause an upgrade or downgrade of the ORA. None of the 2223 subjects had liver progression at post-BL TPs.

Conclusions: Based on the data analysis of a large sample size, it is evident that assessment of liver enlargement as a group A parameter in CLL clinical trials, does not impact the ORA. Liver is rarely even assessed as enlarged by independent reviewers, since hepatomegaly may be caused by various other medical conditions besides CLL. No size or other criteria help distinguish between liver enlargement from CLL versus other causes. We recommend removing liver enlargement as a group A parameter for response assessment as it complicates the assessment paradigm without adding any value to it. Liver involvement should only be assessed for focal lesions, as extranodal disease.

### How I treat splenomegaly in myelofibrosis [^113UCeW1]. Blood Cancer Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The splenomegaly of MF

Splenomegaly, one of the most characteristic features of MF, is due to extramedullary hemopoiesis (also called myeloid metaplasia), which affects not only the spleen but also the liver (and, for this reason, hepatomegaly and alterations of the liver function often coexist) and, more unfrequently, other sites such as the lung, the kidney, the central nervous system, the lymph nodes or the skin. The spleen is palpable in up to 90% of MF patients at presentation. In this sense, it must be noted that if the spleen is not palpable at diagnosis and does not become palpable after 1 or 2 years, the possibility of other conditions such as myelodysplasia, which can also cause cytopenias and marrow fibrosis, should be excluded by careful examination of the bone marrow histopathologic features. Symptoms from splenomegaly usually correlate with spleen size. Thus, some patients with moderate splenomegaly may not have local symptoms initially. However, as the spleen progressively increases, it produces mechanical discomfort in the left part of the abdomen, occasionally episodes of severe pain in the left upper quadrant irradiating to the shoulder and due to splenic infarctions, early saciety and diarrhea. These symptoms are frequently associated with profound cachexia and fatigue, accentuation of pre-existing cytopenias and, sometimes, signs of portal hypertension. Of note, despite its clinical relevance in MF, splenomegaly is not per se a poor prognostic factor of the disease, as it is usually observed in patients displaying other well-recognized unfavorable prognostic factors, such as severe anemia, constitutional symptoms or marked leukocytosis.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^117GxEgh]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) — diagnostic imaging performance and selection: An MRI with a hepatobiliary contrast agent can correctly classify FNH from adenoma with an accuracy of over 90%, and MRI has a specificity of almost 100%; if MRI is contraindicated, multiphase CT can be performed, and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) can be used with increased diagnostic accuracy in lesions measuring < 3 cm. On hepatobiliary phase (HBP) imaging at 20 minutes, diagnosis can be made with nearly 100% confidence, and only 2% of FNH are hypointense; however, 11% of inflammatory and 59% of β-catenin mutated adenomas can show HBP hyperintense signal, so atypical dynamic imaging with HBP hyperintensity should be closely followed. If diagnosis cannot be made by imaging, a biopsy may be considered after multidisciplinary tumor board discussion, but interpretation can be difficult with some series reporting diagnosis as low as 58%.

Diagnostic laparoscopy for liver diseases — rationale for the procedure states that liver disease amenable to laparoscopic exploration can be divided into three main categories, including discrete masses (metastatic cancer, hepatoma, or benign masses), diffuse diseases (HIV-related liver function abnormalities, hepatomegaly with or without splenomegaly, unexplained portal hypertension, and cirrhosis), and disease processes possibly related to the liver (ascites, abnormal liver function tests, or fever of unknown origin); diagnostic laparoscopy may play a role as an adjunct to other diagnostic tests, especially when the diagnosis is in question or to grade the severity of disease.

Hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) was ultimately diagnosed on genetic testing. Haemochromatosis is a difficult diagnosis in older people because not only are the symptoms protean and occur commonly in other geriatric conditions, but HH is also considered an unlikely new diagnosis in the over 80s; it is generally felt to present in the 5th decade for men or 6th decade for women. However, older people can present with only mild disease, so diagnosis is important not just for family screening but also since treatment can reduce unnecessary morbidity and mortality in a population with increasing longevity.

### Portal hypertensive bleeding in cirrhosis: risk stratification, diagnosis, and management: 2016 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^115BYobX]. Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Noninvasive tests for the diagnosis of gastroesophageal varices (GEV) — risk stratification and endoscopy avoidance thresholds: The discriminative accuracy of NITs in predicting the presence of any GEV is limited (AUROC between 0.71 and 0.84), and the use of NITs to diagnose GEV is not recommended. However, NITs are accurate to rule out high-risk varices in patients with CC, and LS combined with platelet count correctly identifies patients at very low risk (< 5%) of having high-risk varices. By consensus among experts, and after review of the literature, it was proposed that patients with CC with LS < 20 kPa (determined by TE) and a platelet count > 150,000/mm³ were very unlikely to have high-risk varices (< 5%), and endoscopy could be safely avoided in them; unpublished studies report that 20%-25% of EGDs can be circumvented. In patients with cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis B, an LSPS (liver stiffness [in kPa] × spleen size [in cm]/platelet count [in number/mm3] score) < 3.5 was accurate in ruling out high-risk varices.

### Preoperative weight loss in high-risk superobese bariatric patients: a computed tomography-based analysis [^113Se5Dp]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Superobesity, through organomegaly, excessive adiposity, and associated severe co-morbidities, is a recognized risk factor for bariatric surgery. Our study examined the utility of preoperative weight loss with a liquid low-calorie diet (LCD) as a method of risk reduction.

Methods

All patients with a body mass index (BMI) > 50 kg/m² were instructed to consume a LCD (800 kcal/d) with the goal of losing ≥ 10% of their body weight. The co-morbidities were monitored. The abdominal wall depth and cross-sectional areas of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) at 12 and 20 cm below the costal margin, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and liver volume were measured, using computed tomography, at baseline and after completion of the LCD. Laparoscopic gastric bypass was performed in all patients.

Results

The study included 30 patients (27 men and 3 women) with a mean age of 53 years (range 34–53). The mean BMI was reduced from 56 kg/m² (range 50–69) at baseline to 49 kg/m² (range 43–60) after an average of 9 weeks of the LCD. The VAT decreased from a mean of 388 cm² to 342 cm². The abdominal wall depth decreased from 3.6 to 3.2 cm at 12 cm below the costal margin and from 3.7 to 3.4 cm at 20 cm. The mean SAT at both 12 and 20 cm below the costal margin had decreased from 577 cm² and 687 cm² to 509 cm² and 614 cm², respectively. The liver volume was reduced by 18%. All co-morbidities were well controlled at LCD completion. No patient died, and 2 minor complications occurred postoperatively.

Conclusion

The results of our study have shown that preoperative LCD is a safe and effective tool leading to a significant decrease in liver volume and abdominal wall depth, as well as a reduction in both VAT and SAT. Its use might contribute to improved short-term surgical outcomes in high-risk superobese patients.

### Noninvasive prediction of insufficient biochemical response after ursodeoxycholic acid treatment in patients with primary biliary cholangitis based on pretreatment nonenhanced MRI [^111sQy3G]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Hepatomegaly is defined as an abnormal diffuse enlargement of the liver, but there is still a lack of consensus on the appropriate thresholds. Imaging diagnosis of hepatomegaly is often based on the automatic acquisition on software of a workstation, and virtual value of liver volume can also be obtained based on calculation formulas. Nevertheless, to facilitate consideration of the volume of the liver in clinical practice, recent studies have commonly used unidimensional measurement as a diagnostic criterion for hepatomegaly in PBC. According to the results of previous studies, approximately 11 to 50% of patients with PBC present the feature of hepatomegaly, which varies depending on the stage of the disease. In the early stages of PBC, the liver tends to be normal in volume or mildly enlarged, whereas in patients with advanced stage or very severe portal hypertension, liver atrophy or segmental lobar hypertrophy or atrophy is more common. Our study found that hepatomegaly was a significant predictor of an insufficient response to UDCA in PBC. We speculate that this might be associated with damaged liver parenchymal cells, inflammatory cell infiltration, and liver stasis. The presence of hepatomegaly might suggest that the disease has started to progress from the earliest stages (normal liver volume) to the intermediate stages, and in patients treated with UDCA, an insufficient biochemical response may occur at this moment.

In addition, the presence of narrowing of the bile ducts was also associated with an insufficient biochemical response to UDCA in PBC. As reported in previous studies, in the early stages of PBC, when cirrhosis or liver fibrosis has not yet developed, the bile duct may appear normal on imaging in the vast majority of patients, while as the disease progresses towards cirrhosis, the intrahepatic bile ducts become destroyed and damaged, leading to fewer intrahepatic bile ducts and an irregular morphology. Bergasa et al reported that patients with fatigue or pruritus at diagnosis were at significantly higher risk of an insufficient UDCA response and were more likely to develop cirrhosis and its complications. Moreover, patients with advanced histology and bile duct deficiency were also reported to be more likely to show an insufficient biochemical response. Given these results, we hypothesise that patients with PBC who presented with narrowing of bile ducts are more likely to be in an advanced stage or have symptoms of liver function impairment. Therefore, treatment with UDCA at this stage may not be effective in improving patient prognosis.

### Granulomatous liver disease in Thailand: a 20-year retrospective clinicoradiopathological analysis [^1178QTVz]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

In conclusion, the evidence from our country strongly indicates that infectious causes, namely Mycobacterium infections, continue to be the leading cause of GLD. We also learnt, and should keep in mind, that about one-fifth of the cases were due to non-infectious causes or systemic diseases with liver manifestations. There are some clues from clinical characteristics, basic laboratory results, and radiological findings that may remind physicians of GLD or that may point out some aetiologies of GLD; however, there remains no consistent pattern that will provide a specific diagnosis without other supporting evidence. Nonetheless, we found that certain features favour the diagnosis of NTM, such as HIV infection, BMI of less than 18 kg/m², hepatomegaly, ALP levels greater than 400 IU/L and serum ALB levels below 3 g/dL. Similarly, the classification of granulomas alone does not provide definitive evidence for certain diseases, highlighting the importance of conducting comprehensive evaluations beyond liver biopsy to accurately identify the underlying cause. Although our study can serve as a data source and guide to the differential diagnosis in patients with GLD, further research (eg, systematic reviews or large multicentre studies) is necessary to confirm these findings and offer robust evidence-based data.

2016 WHO classification criteria for mastocytosis — For systemic mastocytosis (SM), diagnosis requires 1 major and 1 minor or 3 minor criteria; the major criterion is multifocal dense infiltrates of mast cells in bone marrow biopsies and/or sections of other extracutaneous organs, and minor criteria include a KIT point mutation at codon 816 and aberrant antigen expression with CD2 and/or CD25+. SM is subclassified as indolent SM (low mast cell burden, no C findings), smoldering SM (high mast cell burden, ≥ 2 B findings), SM-AHN, aggressive SM (≥ 1 C finding), and mast cell leukemia defined by diffuse infiltration with > 20% mast cell in bone marrow aspirate that are atypical and immature (± circulating mast cells). B findings include mast cell infiltration grade in the bone marrow > 30% by histology with basal serum tryptase level > 200 ng/mL, hypercellular bone marrow with dysmyelopoiesis without substantial cytopenias, and organomegaly such as palpable hepatomegaly, palpable splenomegaly, or palpable lymphadenopathy (on CT or ultrasound: > 2 cm) without impaired organ function. C findings indicative of organ damage include cytopenia(s): ANC < 1,000/μL, hemoglobin < 10 g/dL, or platelet count < 100,000/μL, along with hepatomegaly with ascites and impaired liver function, palpable splenomegaly with hypersplenism, malabsorption with hypoalbuminemia and weight loss, skeletal lesions with large-sized osteolysis and pathologic fractures, or life-threatening organ damage in other organ systems due to local mast cell infiltration in tissues.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^115PkWRv]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries — initial steps should confirm the abnormality and structure history and examination. Before initiation of evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries, one should repeat the lab panel and/or perform a clarifying test (e.g. GGT if serum alkaline phosphatase is elevated) to confirm that the liver chemistry is actually abnormal. The initial history should assess risk factors for liver diseases including viral hepatitis, metabolic liver disease, exposures to toxins, and medications including alcohol and complementary-alternative medicines, associated diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic diseases, pulmonary disease, and cardiac disease as well as hereditary forms of liver disease. In those who present with jaundice and abdominal pain, obtaining a history of prior hepatobiliary disease including gallstones and inflammatory bowel disease is recommended. The physical examination of a patient with abnormal liver tests is typically normal, but certain findings might help to confirm the presence of chronic liver disease including jaundice, ascites, splenomegaly, palmar erythema, spiders, and hepatic encephalopathy.

### Long-term outcome of liver transplantation in childhood: a study of 20-year survivors [^115hgEke]. American Journal of Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

We report the results of a study of survival, liver and kidney functions, and growth with a median follow-up of 24 years following liver transplantation in childhood. From 1988 to 1993, 128 children underwent deceased donor liver transplantation (median age: 2.5 years). Twenty-year patient and graft survival rates were 79% and 64%, respectively. Raised serum aminotransferase and/or γ-glutamyl transferase activities were present in 42% of survivors after a single transplantation. Graft histology (35 patients) showed signs of chronic rejection in 11 and biliary obstruction in 5. Mean total fibrosis scores were 4.5/9 and 3/9 in patients with abnormal and normal serum liver tests, respectively. Glomerular filtration rate was < 90 mL·min⁻¹ in 35 survivors, including 4 in end-stage renal disease who were undergoing dialysis or had undergone renal transplantation. Median final heights were 159 cm for women and 172 cm for men; final height was below the target height in 37 patients. Twenty-year survival after childhood liver transplantation may be close to 80%, and final height is within the normal range for most patients. However, chronic kidney disease or altered liver biochemistries are present in over one third of patients, which is a matter of concern for the future.

### Liver segmentation: indications, techniques and future directions [^114yW8ZF]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Segmentation refers to the process of delineating an organ of interest — typically on multiplanar computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) — for volumetric or morphological analysis. The liver is one of the most difficult organs to segment due to its highly variable shape and close proximity to other organs. In addition, the liver is subject to diverse pathologies that may modify its density, signal intensity or distort its architecture. Examples include liver fat, iron deposits, fibrosis and tumours.

Although physical examination has long been used to detect liver size, the variability of liver sizes among patients limits its ability to detect pathology. As seen in Fig. 1, livers of similar cranial-caudal length may have markedly different volumes. Standard liver volumes can be calculated from the patient's body surface area or mass using the formulas proposed by Vauthey et al. in 2000. However, these formulas are limited by subject demographics (healthy individuals) and by their modest correlation to liver sizes calculated by more advanced forms of volumetry.

Fig. 1
Variability of liver shape and size. Livers of different shape and volume may have similar cranial-caudal length, as demonstrated with these examples of three different patients. This observation highlights the limitation of reporting a one-dimensional measure of length, a well-entrenched practice, as a surrogate measure of liver volume

The era of modern imaging technology has offered new and more accurate tools to estimate liver volume. CT volumetry of the liver was first performed on cadavers by Heymsfield et al. in 1979 and was shown to be accurate within 5% of water displacement volumetry. Today, liver volume can be calculated from both CT and MRI examinations. CT is more commonly used due to its greater accessibility, higher spatial resolution, robustness and short acquisition time. MRI, conversely, offers multiple contrast mechanisms and the ability to assess vascular and biliary anatomy in addition to parenchymal pathology. MRI also minimises the risk of nephrotoxicity and eliminates concerns of radiation exposure.

### The impact of hepatic and splenic volumetric assessment in imaging for chronic liver disease: a narrative review [^114Ub9Mb]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic liver disease (CLD) is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. The spectrum of CLD ranges from early asymptomatic hepatic inflammation, injury and/or fibrosis, to end-stage liver disease with complications of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, decompensation, liver cancer and death. Globally, hepatitis B and hepatitis C remain the most common causes of cirrhosis. While viral hepatitis and alcoholic liver disease have traditionally contributed to the majority of CLD cases in Western countries, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now a rapidly growing contributor to the CLD burden.

Diagnosis, prognostication, and management of CLD rely upon clinical assessment, blood-based biochemistry, serological and molecular testing, invasive (liver biopsy) and non-invasive tests (liver elastography and imaging). Ultrasound (US) is the modality of choice for initial assessment of the liver due to wide availability, reduced cost, lack of ionising radiation, and avoidance of intravenous contrast administration. However, some limitations in US imaging, such as the inability to fully visualise and characterise the liver parenchyma and focal lesions (e.g. in obese patients), have led to the use of other modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These modalities can fully visualise the liver and adjacent structures in the upper abdomen providing a reproducible assessment of the liver and biliary system and can detect features of portal hypertension such as splenomegaly, even in markedly obese patients, where US is often impractical.

CT and MRI scans are usually performed with an intravenous contrast agent, which is important for characterising focal liver lesions. However, contrast-enhanced imaging is also used for the assessment of the liver parenchyma and vasculature (portal vein patency and porto-systemic shunts). Morphological changes of cirrhosis on CT and MRI include atrophy of the right lobe and segment IV, hypertrophy of segments I–III, liver surface nodularity (LSN), an expanded gallbladder fossa, enlargement of periportal spaces at the porta hepatis and the right lobe posterior notch. The accuracy of such findings for diagnosing cirrhosis ranges from 70 to 90%. However, knowledge of the accuracy of subjective interpretation of CT and MRI in the assessment of liver parenchyma for early and advanced stages of fibrosis (pre-cirrhosis) is limited. In one study assessing subjective assessment on MRI, LSN had 80% accuracy in detecting significant fibrosis (F2 or greater).

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113JkQRa]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

When should liver blood tests be checked?

There are a range of settings where requesting liver blood tests should be considered to determine the presence, or severity, of liver disease:

Non-specific symptoms

Liver disease tends to develop silently with no signs or symptoms, and there is evidence that the majority of people with late-stage liver disease are undiagnosed. However, inflammatory liver diseases including autoimmune liver disease and viral hepatitis can be associated with symptoms. For example, 75% of patients with AIH have one or more non-specific symptoms, such as fatigue, nausea or anorexia. These diseases can be effectively treated, and are often diagnosed late, so the presence of these non-specific symptoms would be an indication to check routine liver blood tests, accepting that there are many other causes for these symptoms.

Evidence of chronic liver disease

Patients with symptoms or signs of cirrhosis, portal hypertension or liver failure, including ascites, peripheral oedema, spider naevi and hepatosplenomegaly, need liver blood tests to monitor their function. In that regard the inclusion of INR is important to fully define their synthetic function.

Conditions which are associated with a high risk of developing liver disease

Autoimmune liver disease is more common in patients with pre-existing autoimmune diseases, and liver blood tests may be appropriate if clinical symptoms change to suggest development of liver disease — for example, pruritus in primary biliary cholangitis. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) have a particular notable risk of developing the autoimmune cholestatic liver disease, primary sclerosing cholangitis; disease prevalence is estimated at just under 10%. Primary sclerosing cholangitis-inflammatory bowel disease is associated with increased complications relating to liver disease, as well as increased colorectal cancer risk. Periodic monitoring of liver blood tests is therefore common practice, with a low clinical threshold for investigation of cholestatic liver blood tests by MRI. In the absence of currently approved medical therapy ongoing efforts clinically focus on early recognition of disease with subsequent risk stratification, in order to facilitate timely consideration of trial-based intervention.

Figure 14 — Use of clinical and laboratory evaluations in determining euvolemia at discharge — categorizes congestion severity across none, mild, moderate, and severe/worst using clinical findings and technical tests with explicit thresholds. Jugular venous pulsation (JVP) and hepatojugular reflux (HJR) are graded as " < 8 and no HJR", " < 8", "8–10 or HJR+", "11–15", and " > 16". Hepato megaly is categorized as "Absent", "Liver edge", "Moderate pulsatile enlargement", and "Massive enlargement and tender", and edema as "None", "+1", "+2", and "+3/+4". Functional capacity by six-minute walk test (6 MWT) spans " > 400 m", "300–400 m", "200–300 m", "100–200 m", and " < 100 m". Chest X-ray ranges from "clear" or "cardiomegaly" to signs including "- pulmonary venous congestion", "- small pleural effusions", and "- Interstitial or alveolar edema", with the note that "Chest X-ray can be clear, but presence of abnormalities suggests higher degree of congestion". Technical congestion metrics include vena cava imaging categorized as "None of two", "One of two", or "Both", where the findings are "- Max diameter > 2.2 cm" and "- collapsibility < 50%", and lung ultrasound thresholds of " < 15 B-lines when scanning 28-sites", "15–30 B-lines when scanning 28-sites", and " > 30 B-lines when scanning 28-sites".

Surgical Endoscopy (2008). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic laparoscopy — diagnostic accuracy for liver disease: The procedure leads to the correct diagnosis in 91% of patients and requires biopsy in most cases (level III). For liver cirrhosis, the sensitivity and specificity have been reported at 100% and 97%, respectively. Diagnostic yield varies by indication, reported as chronic liver disease 98%, cancer 85%, ascites 82%, abnormal liver function tests 91%, HIV-related abnormal liver function tests 81%, and hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, unexplained portal hypertension, fever of unknown origin, or cholestasis 74%. Visual inspection of the liver alone without biopsy has been reported to be 96% sensitive and 100% specific for detecting fatty infiltration or non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis, and in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection it has been suggested that the visual diagnosis of cirrhosis is more accurate than the histological diagnosis, at least for the prediction of treatment success with interferon-alfa.

A previously healthy 43-year-old man presented with dyspnoea, 15 kg weight loss, severe hepatomegaly and alkaline phosphatase at 5400 U/L. Examinations seemed to suggest cirrhosis, but blood samples did not show any signs of underlying liver disease. Liver biopsy revealed amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis and bone marrow showed multiple myeloma (MM). The patient was treated with drugs of choice cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone. He responded well to the treatment and so far achieved partial response. Previously MM was associated with poor prognosis but due to improved treatment for AL the patient can achieve a progression-free period with good quality of life.

Hepatocellular carcinoma screening — The panel recommends screening with ultrasound (US) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) testing (every 6 months) for patients with established risk factors for HCC, and additional imaging (abdominal multiphasic CT or MRI) is recommended with a rising serum AFP or a liver mass nodule ≥ 10 mm on US; imaging is useful if the liver cannot be adequately visualized with US, and it is also reasonable to screen patients with cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRI), though not well-studied in the United States. For liver masses < 10 mm, US and AFP testing should be repeated in 3 to 6 months, and patients with viral hepatitis who have had a complete or sustained viral response should continue with screening despite that response.
