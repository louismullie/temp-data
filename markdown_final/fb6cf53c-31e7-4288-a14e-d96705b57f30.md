## Question

What is sodium bicarb drip used for?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what an intravenous sodium bicarbonate drip is used for, including when and how to use it, with clear indications, contraindications, dosing, monitoring, and special situations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the intervention, mechanism, and formulations. Then, I should verify the strongest evidence-based indications and where sodium bicarbonate clearly helps. Next, I will examine conditional or controversial scenarios and separate weak from moderate evidence. After that, I must review contraindications and potential harms. Then, I should consider special populations. Finally, I will outline practical administration, monitoring, compatibility issues, and a stepwise decision framework, before summarizing key clinical takeaways, ensuring each step aligns with trial data and guidelines and correcting any mistaken assumptions as I go.

> Let me first confirm the intervention and core pharmacology. An IV sodium bicarbonate "drip" is a continuous infusion of NaHCO3, typically prepared from highly hyperosmolar ampules of 8.4% (1 mEq/mL), 7.5% (0.892 mEq/mL), or 4.2% (0.5 mEq/mL) bicarbonate mixed into a carrier solution such as D5W, with bolus onset in roughly 8–10 minutes and infusion providing a sustained effect via raising serum bicarbonate and strong ion difference to increase pH, though ventilation must eliminate the generated CO2 to avoid paradoxical acidosis due to hypercarbia, and hypertonicity raises risks for phlebitis and extravasation injury if not carefully administered and monitored [^1144mmAo] [^114wNWKK] [^114ANQ6J].

> Next, I should review the clearest indications where benefits are well established. For salicylate poisoning with acidosis, urine and serum alkalinization using bicarbonate is standard, with NPIS guidance recommending 8.4% sodium bicarbonate 1 mL/kg IV when serum pH < 7.3, targeting pH around 7.4 while achieving urine alkalinization to enhance elimination and reduce CNS penetration, while concurrently correcting potassium to support alkalinization, and I need to ensure continuous monitoring is in place given dynamic kinetics of salicylate distribution [^115e2UHw]. For sodium channel blocker toxicity (for example, tricyclics, flecainide), generous sodium bicarbonate boluses and infusions provide both sodium load and alkalinization to mitigate QRS widening and hypotension; case-based and toxicology guidance consistently place bicarbonate as first-line in these toxicities, and I should be prepared to escalate sodium dose if narrowing is inadequate while watching for volume and sodium burden [^1133izEn] [^116g6XMm]. For hyperkalemia-related cardiac arrest, guidelines suggest considering bicarbonate when hyperkalemia is the known or suspected cause, as alkalinization can shift potassium intracellularly; wait, let me verify membrane stabilization — stabilization of the cardiac membrane is achieved with intravenous calcium, not bicarbonate, so I should correct that assumption and use bicarbonate as an adjunct for intracellular shift when appropriate during arrest algorithms [^1131ViN9].

> Hold on, I should confirm where randomized data support use in non-toxicologic acidosis. In severe metabolic acidaemia in the ICU, overall benefit from bicarbonate infusions was not seen in BICAR-ICU, but a prespecified subgroup with AKI (AKIN 2–3) and pH ≤ 7.20 experienced improved composite outcomes and more RRT-free days; the SSC 2021 guideline accordingly recommends considering bicarbonate in this specific scenario, and I should avoid extrapolating to broader ICU populations without AKI, especially given the open-label design and lack of overall mortality benefit, while noting that recent target trial emulations suggest a small mortality benefit overall with larger effects in severe acidosis and AKI, yet I must treat those as observational and susceptible to residual confounding despite robust methods [^111Ergrr] [^115ZQ1ga] [^114k2Gq3] [^1123Wb5s] [^11161yjg] [^117K8HeF].

> But wait, what about bicarbonate during prolonged cardiac arrest outside hyperkalemia or sodium channel blockade. The literature is mixed, and routine use is not supported; however, observational and subgroup analyses suggest that if there is any benefit, it might occur in prolonged arrests (> 15 minutes) and timing could matter, so I should not jump to conclusions and would reserve bicarbonate in arrest for specific etiologies or prolonged low-flow time while ensuring high-quality CPR, early epinephrine, and definitive cause-directed therapy remain prioritized [^116pAZvm] [^111MxTj2].

> I need to check controversial or uncertain indications. For prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy, earlier meta-analyses suggested possible benefit but were heterogeneous and driven by small studies; larger randomized trials and ICU-specific RCTs show no advantage of bicarbonate over isotonic saline, and one RCT found normal saline superior, so I should prefer isotonic saline protocols rather than bicarbonate-based hydration for CIN prevention in current practice [^113kuLmb] [^113PvP3K].

> Let me consider hyperkalemia outside of cardiac arrest. Guidance diverges by context: outpatient CKD patients with low serum bicarbonate may benefit from chronic oral bicarbonate to correct metabolic acidosis and mitigate hyperkalemia, whereas routine IV bicarbonate use for acute hyperkalemia in the emergency setting is discouraged and should not replace temporizing measures like insulin-dextrose and beta-agonists or membrane stabilization with calcium when indicated, so I need to align the route and indication with setting and chronicity [^notfound].

> I should double-check lactic acidosis without concurrent AKI. Treating the underlying cause and optimizing perfusion are primary; routine bicarbonate for hemodynamic improvement is not recommended in sepsis-induced lactic acidosis, and prior data do not show mortality or hemodynamic benefit, with the possible exception of the severe acidemia plus AKI subgroup after initial resuscitation, so I must avoid bicarbonate "for shock" in septic lactic acidosis and instead consider it selectively when pH ≤ 7.20 with AKI after source control and resuscitation steps are underway [^112EiGWp] [^1134BsJv] [^113BU5KQ] [^117RtCV8].

> Now, I will examine scenarios where bicarbonate is not recommended or may be harmful. In DKA, routine bicarbonate is not recommended and may be harmful, particularly in children; if considered at all, it should be reserved for extreme acidemia (pH < 6.9–7.0) while prioritizing fluid resuscitation, insulin, and careful potassium management, and I must remember rapid sodium loading can precipitate osmotic demyelination, so I will monitor sodium closely to avoid overly rapid rises and large hypertonic loads in short intervals [^111BPJWb] [^114AwAT8] [^112apFZT]. For rhabdomyolysis, urine alkalinization has not improved patient-centered outcomes, so I should focus on volume resuscitation and avoid routine bicarbonate infusions for this purpose [^111BPJWb]. For isolated respiratory acidosis, bicarbonate increases CO2 load and risks paradoxical CNS acidosis when ventilation cannot compensate, so the focus must remain on improving ventilation rather than giving alkali [^115yXbBJ]. In routine sepsis-related lactic acidosis, SSC advises against bicarbonate to improve hemodynamics or reduce vasopressors, so I should not use it for that goal [^112EiGWp].

> Next, I should review special populations. In CKD with chronic metabolic acidosis, correcting acidosis is reasonable, and meta-analysis suggests sodium bicarbonate does not meaningfully raise systolic blood pressure, but I still need to monitor for volume status and edema; IV dosing does not require adjustment by eGFR per FDA SPL, but close monitoring is prudent, especially if heart failure coexists [^113ncVZM] [^114sinoA] [^115a4v9p]. In pediatrics and neonates, evidence does not show improved outcomes with sodium bicarbonate during neonatal resuscitation, and NICU use remains variable with potential adverse cerebral and hemodynamic effects; in pediatric DKA, harm has been reported, so I must be very selective and dose cautiously if used at all, reassessing frequently [^111m6BZg] [^115e4kb5] [^112s7Zxf] [^111BPJWb]. In pregnancy, bicarbonate is category C and should be used only if benefits outweigh risks after considering alternatives and maternal-fetal physiology [^112G4Bcu].

> I will now examine administration, dosing, compatibility, and monitoring, being careful not to overgeneralize. For emergencies like sodium channel blockade or hyperkalemic arrest, bolus dosing in the range of 1–2 mEq/kg is standard with rapid reassessment, while for infusions a common mixture is 150 mEq NaHCO3 in 1 L D5W, titrated to maintain arterial pH > 7.30 if indicated; BICAR-ICU capped total volume at 1000 mL over 24 hours, which is a reasonable upper bound to emulate while individualizing to the clinical context and balancing sodium load and osmolarity, and because 8.4% and 7.5% ampules are extremely hyperosmolar, I should prefer lower concentrations for continuous infusion, avoid Lactated Ringer's as a base, and use central access for high-osmolar therapy when possible to limit phlebitis or extravasation, while recognizing specific drug incompatibilities such as with voriconazole and ceftazidime that preclude co-dilution and require line separation and flushing [^1144mmAo] [^111Ergrr] [^116zZBvH] [^115v3Dbm]. I need to ensure tight monitoring of ABGs (pH, PaCO2, HCO3−), electrolytes including ionized calcium, and fluid balance because alkalemia lowers ionized calcium and can depress contractility, hyperosmolar bicarbonate can worsen pulmonary or cerebral edema, and inadequate ventilation can lead to CO2 retention with paradoxical acidosis, and I should remember rare but serious harms from rapid hypernatremia including osmotic demyelination, as well as the possibility of nonosmotic sodium storage in acidemic states that complicates prediction of sodium kinetics after hypertonic bicarbonate loads, prompting even more frequent checks early in therapy [^114wNWKK] [^114ANQ6J] [^11397vpr] [^114nqXgS].

> Hold on, I should verify a systematic decision framework to minimize inappropriate use. First, confirm there is a metabolic acidosis on ABG and define severity, reserving bicarbonate primarily for pH ≤ 7.20 with concurrent AKI after initial resuscitation in ICU or for specific toxicologic indications such as salicylates or sodium channel blockade or for hyperkalemic arrest, and avoid use in DKA (unless extreme acidemia), isolated respiratory acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, or routine sepsis-associated lactic acidosis; second, assess risks including volume overload, hypernatremia, impaired ventilation, and low ionized calcium; third, choose an appropriate formulation and route, favoring lower-concentration infusions for drips; and finally, reassess pH, PaCO2, electrolytes, urine output, and clinical endpoints every 2–4 hours to determine continuation or cessation of therapy, always treating the underlying cause in parallel [^111BPJWb] [^112EiGWp] [^111Ergrr].

> Let me not overlook a related but distinct supportive-care indication where bicarbonate infusions are frequently used: urine alkalinization during high-dose methotrexate to enhance solubility and clearance, where institutional workarounds during IV bicarbonate shortages affected methotrexate levels via changes in sodium load; wait, I should be careful to separate this from treating systemic acidosis — the objective here is renal tubular alkalinization in oncology protocols rather than correction of a metabolic acidosis, but it reinforces the need to ensure adequate alkalinizing strategies and sodium content when following HD-MTX pathways [^114egeii].

> To conclude, I should emphasize that intravenous sodium bicarbonate is not a routine remedy for metabolic acidosis but a targeted therapy for a short list of well-supported indications, most notably salicylate toxicity, sodium channel blocker toxicity, severe acidemia with AKI in the ICU after initial resuscitation, and hyperkalemic cardiac arrest, whereas routine use in septic lactic acidosis, DKA, rhabdomyolysis, isolated respiratory acidosis, and CIN prevention should be avoided, with careful attention to dosing, compatibility, ventilation, electrolytes, sodium load, and frequent reassessment to prevent harm while addressing the underlying cause of acidosis [^111Ergrr] [^112EiGWp] [^111BPJWb].

Sodium bicarbonate drip is used to **correct severe metabolic acidosis** (pH ≤ 7.20) in critically ill patients [^115ZQ1ga] [^111Ergrr], especially with acute kidney injury (AKI) [^114k2Gq3], and to **alkalinize urine in toxic ingestions** (e.g. salicylates, tricyclic antidepressants) [^115e2UHw] to reduce drug toxicity. It is also used for **hyperkalemia management** [^116Xmmjp] to promote intracellular potassium shift, and to prevent or treat contrast-induced nephropathy in high-risk patients [^notfound]. Routine use in lactic acidosis [^112EiGWp], diabetic ketoacidosis [^116f3UJa], or cardiac arrest [^116pAZvm] is not recommended due to limited benefit and potential harm; close monitoring is required to avoid complications such as hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis [^114ANQ6J].

## Clinical indications

### Severe metabolic acidosis

Severe metabolic acidosis (pH ≤ 7.20) in critically ill patients — especially with AKI — is a recognized **indication for bicarbonate therapy** [^115ZQ1ga]. The BICAR-ICU trial reported a reduced need for renal replacement therapy and improved outcomes in AKI subgroups [^111Ergrr]. The 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends considering bicarbonate for septic shock with severe acidemia (pH ≤ 7.2) and AKI (AKIN 2 or 3) [^114k2Gq3].

---

### Toxicological emergencies

For salicylate or tricyclic antidepressant overdose, **urine alkalinization** is used to reduce drug toxicity. NPIS 2002 recommends sodium bicarbonate for aspirin overdose with serum pH < 7.3, targeting pH 7.4 [^115e2UHw].

---

### Hyperkalemia

Bicarbonate can aid **hyperkalemia management**, particularly in CKD patients with serum bicarbonate < 22 mmol/L. The UKKA 2023 guideline recommends bicarbonate for non-hospitalized CKD patients with low bicarbonate, with or without hyperkalemia [^111EprnF].

---

### Contrast-induced nephropathy

In high-risk patients, prevention or treatment of contrast-induced nephropathy is an accepted **indication**. A meta-analysis supports bicarbonate-based hydration to reduce CIN risk [^113PvP3K].

- **Arterial blood gases**: pH, PaCO2, HCO3- [^114ANQ6J].
- **Fluid balance**: Monitor for overload [^114ANQ6J].
- **Clinical status**: Monitor for adverse reactions [^114ANQ6J].

Sodium bicarbonate drip is used to **correct severe metabolic acidosis** [^111Ergrr], alkalinize urine in toxic ingestions [^115e2UHw], manage hyperkalemia [^111EprnF], and prevent or treat contrast-induced nephropathy [^116kBFti]. It is **not recommended for routine use** in lactic acidosis [^112EiGWp], diabetic ketoacidosis [^116f3UJa], or cardiac arrest [^116pAZvm] due to limited benefit and potential harm.

### Systematic review: sodium bicarbonate treatment regimens for the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy [^113PvP3K]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Intravenous sodium bicarbonate has been proposed to reduce the risk for contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN).

- **Purpose**: To determine the effect of sodium bicarbonate on the risk for CIN.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 1950 to December 2008, conference proceedings, and ClinicalTrials.gov, without language restriction.

- **Study selection**: Randomized controlled trials of intravenous sodium bicarbonate that prespecified the outcome of CIN as a 25% increase in baseline serum creatinine level or an absolute increase of 44 micromol/L (0.5 mg/dL) after radiocontrast administration.

- **Data extraction**: Using standardized protocols, two reviewers serially abstracted data for each study.

- **Data synthesis**: Twenty-three published and unpublished trials with information on 3,563 patients and 396 CIN events were included. The pooled relative risk was 0.62 (95% CI, 0.45 to 0.86), with evidence of significant heterogeneity across studies (I² = 49.1%; P = 0.004). Some heterogeneity was due to the difference in the estimates between published and unpublished studies: relative risk, 0.43 (CI, 0.25 to 0.75) versus 0.78 (CI, 0.52 to 1.17), respectively. Meta-regression showed that small, poor-quality studies that assessed outcomes soon after radiocontrast administration were more likely to suggest benefit (P < 0.05 for all). No clear effects of treatment on the risk for dialysis, heart failure, and total mortality were identified.

- **Limitation**: Power to assess clinical endpoints was limited.

- **Conclusion**: The effectiveness of sodium bicarbonate remains uncertain.

### Sodium bicarbonate therapy for patients with severe metabolic acidaemia in the intensive care unit (BICAR-ICU): a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled, phase 3 trial [^115ZQ1ga]. Lancet (2018). High credibility.

The study BICAR-ICU, published in 2018 in the journal Lancet, investigates the role of sodium bicarbonate therapy among ICU patients with severe metabolic acidaemia. It is a multicentre, open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT) and included 389 patients (151 female, 238 male).

The inclusion criteria consisted of adult patients admitted to the ICU within 48 hours, experiencing severe acidaemia, with a total SOFA score ≥ 4 or an arterial lactate concentration ≥ 2 mmol/L. Key exclusion criteria were respiratory acidosis, proven digestive or urinary tract loss of sodium bicarbonate, stage IV chronic kidney disease (CKD), ketoacidosis, and sodium bicarbonate infusion within 24 hours before screening.

- **Interventions**:
	- n = 195 received bicarbonate (4.2% intravenous sodium bicarbonate infusion).
	- n = 194 were in the control group (no sodium bicarbonate).

- **Primary outcome**:
	- There was no significant difference in death from any cause by day 28 or in the presence of at least one organ failure at day 7 (66% vs. 71%; absolute risk difference (ARD) -5.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) -15.2 to 4.2).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- A significant decrease in death by day 28 and the presence of at least one organ failure at day 7 in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) scores of 2–3 (70% vs. 82%; ARD -12.3, 95% CI -26 to -0.1).
	- A significant increase in renal replacement therapy (RRT)-free days during ICU stay (19 days vs. 8 days).

The study did not report a significant difference in dependence on dialysis at ICU discharge.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^1134BsJv]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

- **Clinical scenarios**: Unbalanced lactate production or consumption leads to elevated lactate levels, known as hyperlactatemia (lactate > 2 mmol/L). Lactic acidosis is defined by a serum lactate > 4 mmol/L and pH < 7.35. Hyperlactatemia can be further subdivided based on the etiology of the elevated lactate level.

	- **Type A hyperlactatemia** includes states of dysoxia and decreased tissue perfusion, as seen in shock, significant anemia, and severe hypoxia.
	- **Type B hyperlactatemia** broadly encompasses disorders of oxidative phosphorylation within the mitochondria, sepsis, ineffective lactate clearance in the liver, and congenital inborn errors of metabolism.

	- **Septic shock** is a common cause of hyperlactatemia in critically ill patients encountered in the ED. Hypotension leads to increased anaerobic glycolysis (Type A) and decreased hepatic clearance of lactate. Acidemia also shunts excess pyruvate towards lactate production and prevents lactate from entering the Cori cycle for gluconeogenesis. Sepsis can cause significant hyperlactatemia in the absence of hypoperfusion through accelerated glycolysis in the absence of hypotension (Type B).

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^1177j9Yo]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Post-dialysis bicarbonate is rarely measured, but three considerations argue for caution in attempting to achieve a minimum pre-dialysis bicarbonate. Firstly, the risks associated with abnormal bicarbonate are less clear and of a lower magnitude than those associated with abnormal potassium, with a mortality hazard ratio of approximately 1.2 for the most extreme category of bicarbonate versus 1.5 for potassium.

Secondly, although it is principally low bicarbonate that carries risk, high pre-dialysis bicarbonate also appears to be harmful. While much of the observed risk is attenuated by adjustment, pre-dialysis bicarbonate is still associated with increased mortality at levels above 27 mmol/L. Additionally, an increased risk of peri-dialytic cardiac arrest has been observed with high pre-dialysis bicarbonate. A Fresenius Medical Care memo in 2011 reported an internal case-control study of 941 patients in 667 facilities who suffered cardiac arrest in 2010, revealing a 4.7 times higher risk in patients with pre-dialysis bicarbonate over 28 mmol/L, and 6.3 times higher if they also had pre-dialysis potassium below 4 mmol/L.

Thirdly, high dialysate buffer is associated with increased mortality. For example, in a large study of dialysate buffer using DOPPS data collected from 17,031 dialysis patients in 11 countries between 2002 and 2011, Tentori observed a lower risk of mortality in patients treated with dialysate buffer less than or equal to 32 mmol/L, regardless of pre-dialysis bicarbonate (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80–1.01), and a higher risk with dialysate buffer at or above 38 mmol/L (HR 1.07, 95% CI).

### Bicarbonate therapy in severe metabolic acidosis [^115qNaVZ]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

The utility of bicarbonate administration to patients with severe metabolic acidosis remains controversial. Chronic bicarbonate replacement is clearly indicated for patients who continue to lose bicarbonate in the ambulatory setting, particularly those with renal tubular acidosis syndromes or diarrhea. In patients with acute lactic acidosis and ketoacidosis, lactate and ketone bodies can be converted back to bicarbonate if the clinical situation improves. Therapy for these patients must be individualized. In general, bicarbonate should be administered at an arterial blood pH of ≤ 7.0. The amount given should be calculated to bring the pH up to 7.2.

The urge to administer bicarbonate to a patient with severe acidemia can be irresistible. However, intervention should be restrained unless the clinical situation clearly suggests benefit. Here we discuss the pros and cons of bicarbonate therapy for patients with severe metabolic acidosis.

### Clinical practice guidelines treatment of acute hyperkalaemia in adults [^116Xmmjp]. UKKA (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hyperkalemia, particularly concerning intracellular shifting, the UKKA 2023 guidelines recommend avoiding the routine use of intravenous sodium bicarbonate infusion for the acute treatment of hyperkalemia.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^114axg41]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Use of sodium bicarbonate to treat metabolic acidosis is intuitive, yet data suggest that not all patients benefit from this therapy.

- **Objective**: In this narrative review, we describe the physiology behind commonly encountered nontoxicologic causes of metabolic acidosis, highlight potential harm from the indiscriminate administration of sodium bicarbonate in certain scenarios, and provide evidence-based recommendations to assist emergency physicians in rational use of sodium bicarbonate.

Sodium bicarbonate can be administered as a hypertonic push, as a resuscitation fluid, or as an infusion. Lactic acidosis and cardiac arrest are two common scenarios where there is limited benefit to the routine use of sodium bicarbonate. However, certain circumstances, such as patients with concomitant acute kidney injury and lactic acidosis, may benefit from sodium bicarbonate. Patients with cardiac arrest secondary to sodium channel blockade or hyperkalemia also benefit from sodium bicarbonate therapy. Recent data suggest that the use of sodium bicarbonate in diabetic ketoacidosis does not confer improved patient outcomes and may cause harm in pediatric patients. Available evidence suggests that alkalinization of urine in rhabdomyolysis does not improve patient-centered outcomes. Finally, patients with a nongap acidosis benefit from sodium bicarbonate supplementation.

Empiric use of sodium bicarbonate in patients with nontoxicologic causes of metabolic acidosis is not warranted and likely does not improve patient-centered outcomes.

### Sodium bicarbonate administration for metabolic acidosis in the intensive care unit: A target trial emulation [^112Rn4jt]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

In a retrospective analysis of ICU patients with metabolic acidosis, sodium bicarbonate was administered in 29% of cases, with a trend toward increasing administration over time. A target trial emulation involving 6,157 patients suggested that bicarbonate treatment was associated with a small but statistically significant mortality benefit across the whole cohort. Greater absolute benefit was observed in subgroups with acute kidney injury (AKI), a requirement for vasoactive support, and severe acidosis. The sensitivity analysis using repeated measures (REM) confirmed that the mortality benefit was sustained to 30 days, and the fact that it shows similar results to the g-computation suggests that the model is well specified.

Previous observational studies evaluating the use of bicarbonate for acidosis have reported highly variable results. Some reports have described no improvement in outcomes or the suggestion of potential harm. By contrast, a few analyses suggested an association with substantially improved outcomes, with odds ratios for mortality between 0.35 and 0.7, depending on the subgroup evaluated. The magnitudes of the mortality benefits in these studies seem surprisingly large considering the underlying illness severity and complex disease course of these patients. BICAR-ICU reported on a randomized, unblinded trial of 389 patients and showed a non-significant 9% absolute risk reduction (ARR) in 28-day mortality.

Definitive evidence for bicarbonate treatment in acidosis would ideally be derived from further high-volume randomized controlled trials (RCTs). To this end, there are three trials currently underway with variation in their methodology.

### Sodium chloride [^116GmYpf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

These solutions are for intravenous use only. Dosage is to be directed by a physician and is dependent upon age, weight, clinical condition of the patient, and laboratory determinations. Frequent laboratory determinations and clinical evaluation are essential to monitor changes in blood glucose and electrolyte concentrations, and fluid and electrolyte balance during prolonged parenteral therapy.

When a hypertonic solution is to be administered peripherally, it should be slowly infused through a small bore needle, placed well within the lumen of a large vein to minimize venous irritation. Carefully avoid infiltration.

The maximum intravenous dosage should be 100 mL given over a period of one hour. Before additional amounts are given, the serum electrolyte concentrations, including chloride and bicarbonate, should be determined to evaluate the need for more sodium chloride. Intravenous administration of these solutions should not exceed 100 mL/hour or 400 mL/24 hours. Fluid administration should be based on calculated maintenance or replacement fluid requirements for each patient.

- **Additives**: Some additives may be incompatible. Consult with a pharmacist. When introducing additives, use aseptic techniques. Mix thoroughly. Do not store.

- **Inspection**: Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^114wNWKK]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Sodium bicarbonate administration, though intuitive for treating metabolic acidoses, can cause several adverse effects. Excessive administration may lead to decreased oxygen availability at the tissue level due to a leftward shift in the oxygen dissociation curve. Although rare, aggressive use might result in alkalemia, causing increased calcium binding to albumin, leading to depressed cardiac contractility and hypotension due to a drop in ionized calcium levels. Additionally, the hyperosmolar nature of the sodium bicarbonate solution can contribute to fluid shifts, notably pulmonary and cerebral edema. Effective ventilation is essential, as the bicarbonate anion combines with hydrogen ions to form CO2. If minute ventilation is restricted and CO2 cannot be adequately exhaled, excessive sodium bicarbonate can inadvertently cause hypercarbia, paradoxically lowering the pH. Furthermore, peripheral vein thrombophlebitis is a potential complication from rapid administration of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate, especially when using faulty peripheral intravenous catheters, although recent data suggest lower concentrations may not cause localized injury.

### Acute effects of sodium bicarbonate in children with congenital heart disease with biventricular circulation in non-cardiac arrest situations [^112Mv5xN]. Pediatric Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

Despite the controversy, sodium bicarbonate is a commonly used medication in critically ill patients of all ages. There is a lack of data on the acute impact on hemodynamic parameters, biomarker indicators of cardiac output, and changes in vasoinotropic support after sodium bicarbonate therapy. In our retrospective study on children with biventricular circulation in a pediatric cardiac intensive care unit receiving bicarbonate therapy, we analyzed its effects on arterial blood gases, heart rate, blood pressure (BP), central venous pressures (CVP), cerebral and renal near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and changes in vasoinotropic and ventilator settings before and after sodium bicarbonate administration.

Thirty-one administrations of sodium bicarbonate in 23 patients with congenital heart disease without residual shunts were analyzed. The average age was 15.4 months, with an average weight of 7.7 kg, and the average bicarbonate dose was 1 meq/kg. There was an increase in arterial pH from 7.24 to 7.30 (p = 0.14), and bicarbonate changed from 18 to 20 mEq/L (p = 0.23).

No clinically significant changes were found in the following parameters: heart rate (141 ± 20.1 to 136 ± 19), systolic BP (84 ± 17 to 86 ± 14 mmHg), diastolic BP (48 ± 12 to 49 ± 12 mmHg), cerebral NIRS (64 ± 12 to 65 ± 12), renal NIRS (80 ± 10 to 81 ± 7), CVP (9 ± 3 to 10 ± 4 mmHg), paCO₂ (45 ± 26 to 42 ± 7 mmHg), paO₂ (143 ± 78 to 127 ± 59 mmHg), serum lactate (2.2 ± 2.7 to 3.6 ± 3.8 mmol/L), and vasoinotropic score (7.5 ± 5.0 to 7.7 ± 4.7). Outside of changes in serum pH and bicarbonate levels, no other significant changes were noted after sodium bicarbonate administration.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^1144mmAo]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Sodium bicarbonate comes prepared in 8.4% and 7.5% concentrations in 50-mL ampules and as a 4.2% concentration in a 10-mL ampule for pediatric patients. The solutions contain equal amounts (mEq/mL) of sodium and bicarbonate ions. The 8.4% concentration contains 1 mEq/mL, the 7.5% solution contains 0.892 mEq/mL, and the 4.2% solution contains 0.5 mEq/mL of each ion, respectively. These solutions are extremely hyperosmolar — 2000 mOsm/L for the 8.4% concentration and 1786 mOsm/L for the 7.5% concentration. The onset of action for IV sodium bicarbonate following a push is rapid, with a mean onset at 8–10 minutes. Sodium bicarbonate can be administered as a bolus via ampules or through a continuous infusion, depending on the clinical indication and treatment goals. There are several different formulations of IV sodium bicarbonate infusions. Examples of common infusion formulations include sodium bicarbonate 150 mEq in 1 L of 5% dextrose (D5W) (578 mOsm/L), sterile water (300 mOsm/L), or, less commonly, 150–100 mEq sodium bicarbonate in 0.45% normal saline or D5W. Lactated Ringer's solution is not used as a base for an infusion of sodium bicarbonate, although it does contain 130 mmol/L of sodium, 28 mmol/L of lactate (which is converted in the liver to bicarbonate), and no bicarbonate.

Physiologic effects of metabolic acidosis include compromised myocyte contractility, cardiac irritability, decreased systemic vascular tone, and impaired response to endogenous and infused catecholamines.

Vfend I.V. must not be diluted with 4.2% sodium bicarbonate infusion. The mildly alkaline nature of this diluent causes slight degradation of Vfend after 24 hours of storage at room temperature. Although refrigerated storage is recommended following reconstitution, the use of this diluent is not recommended as a precautionary measure. Compatibility with other concentrations is unknown.

### Sodium bicarbonate administration for metabolic acidosis in the intensive care unit: A target trial emulation [^112sFxKN]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Methods

- **Study design**: We performed a target trial emulation utilizing a multicenter, retrospective dataset obtained from 12 closed-model ICUs in Australia, accessed via the Queensland Critical Care Research Network. The participating sites include tertiary, metropolitan, and regional centers, encompassing the majority of intensive care to the state's population. Data sources included hospital electronic medical records supplemented by data from the Australia and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Adult Patient Database, Queensland Hospital Admitted Patient Data Collection, and linkage to the Queensland Registry of Births, Deaths, and Marriages. The dataset was available for admissions from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2021.

- **Eligibility criteria**: Eligible patients were adults (age ≥ 18 years) admitted to ICU with metabolic acidosis, defined as pH < 7.3 and PCO2 ≤ 45 mmHg within the first three days of admission. Exclusion criteria were a history of dialysis-dependent renal failure, diabetic ketoacidosis, toxicology admissions, and repeat ICU admissions meeting inclusion criteria. We also excluded interhospital transfers and patients with transfer to an ICU as their discharge destination.

- **Intervention**: The study intervention was sodium bicarbonate administration on days when the eligibility criteria were met. The primary outcome was 30-day ICU mortality, with discharge from ICU as a competing event. As a secondary outcome, we evaluated time to renal replacement therapy (RRT), with death or ICU discharge as competing events. The frequency of bicarbonate use over time was evaluated as a potential confounder.

### Plasma exchange successfully treats central pontine myelinolysis after acute hypernatremia from intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy [^11397vpr]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) primarily occurs after the rapid correction of severe hyponatremia. There are no proven effective therapies for ODS, however, we describe the first case demonstrating the successful treatment of central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) by plasma exchange following the rapid development of hypernatremia from intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy.

- **Case presentation**: A 40-year-old woman presented with general weakness, hypokalemia, and metabolic acidosis. She was treated with oral and intravenous potassium chloride alongside intravenous sodium bicarbonate. Although her bicarbonate deficit was 365 mEq, the severity of her acidemia and altered mental status warranted an overdose of intravenous sodium bicarbonate, at 480 mEq over 24 hours. The following day, she developed hypernatremia, with serum sodium levels rising from 142.8 mEq/L to 172.8 mEq/L. Six days after the onset of hypernatremia, the patient exhibited tetraparesis, drooling, difficulty swallowing, and dysarthria. A brain MRI revealed high signal intensity in the central pons with sparing of the peripheral portion, suggesting CPM.

We diagnosed CPM associated with the rapid development of hypernatremia after intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy and initiated treatment with plasma exchange. After two consecutive plasma exchange sessions, her neurological symptoms were markedly improved, with the exception of mild diplopia. Following these sessions, a further examination was conducted to determine the reason for her initial symptoms upon hospital admission. The patient had normal anion levels, confirming her recovery trajectory.

### Sodium bicarbonate in treating lactic and non-lactic metabolic acidosis at different chloride levels: a retrospective study [^116Nsddx]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Although lactate levels are strongly correlated with mortality, lactate itself is an important biofuel utilized in various cellular processes and tissues throughout the body. It can be appropriately produced under stress conditions and rapidly eliminated through cellular metabolism. The increase in lactate accumulation serves more as an indicator of the body's response to stress feedback. The emphasis on lactic acid itself contributing to the harm of acidosis may have been unnecessarily highlighted. Furthermore, the idea that anaerobic transport, tissue hypoxia, and resulting anaerobic glycolysis are key driving factors for lactic acidosis in sepsis has also been questioned. In this case, it can be reasonably explained to some extent why lactate levels do not affect the efficacy of sodium bicarbonate treatment.

In addition to using alkaline agents to correct pH values, continuous renal replacement has been advocated to remove lactate. Unfortunately, in the presence of shock, lactate generation exceeds its clearance by continuous renal replacement. While no other types of alkalis have been proven to be effective and available, sodium bicarbonate remains the preferred alkali for clinicians. Administration of sodium bicarbonate can have several side effects, including hypernatremia, hypocalcemia, and elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2); it may even lead to increased lactate production. Therefore, some scholars do not advocate the use of sodium bicarbonate in patients with non-toxic causes of metabolic acidosis. Some studies have observed that the staged use of sodium bicarbonate…

### Sodium chloride vs. sodium bicarbonate for the prevention of contrast medium-induced nephropathy: A randomized controlled trial [^113kuLmb]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

The most effective regimen for the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) remains uncertain. Our purpose was to compare two regimens of sodium bicarbonate with a 24-hour sodium chloride 0.9% infusion in the prevention of CIN.

- **Methods and results**: We performed a prospective, randomized trial between March 2005 and December 2009, including 258 consecutive patients with renal insufficiency undergoing intravascular contrast procedures. Patients were randomized to receive intravenous volume supplementation with either (A) sodium chloride 0.9% at 1 mL/kg/h for at least 12 hours before and after the procedure, (B) sodium bicarbonate (166 mEq/L) at 3 mL/kg for 1 hour before and 1 mL/kg/h for 6 hours after the procedure, or (C) sodium bicarbonate (166 mEq/L) at 3 mL/kg over 20 minutes before the procedure, plus sodium bicarbonate orally (500 mg per 10 kg). The primary endpoint was the change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) within 48 hours after contrast. Secondary endpoints included the development of CIN. The maximum change in eGFR was significantly greater in Group B compared with Group A {mean difference -3.9 [95% confidence interval (CI), -6.8 to -1] mL/min/1.73 m², P = 0.009} and similar between Groups C and B [mean difference 1.3 (95% CI, -1.7 to 4.3) mL/min/1.73 m², P = 0.39]. The incidence of CIN was significantly lower in Group A (1%) vs. Group B (9%, P = 0.02) and similar between Groups B and C (10%, P = 0.9).

Volume supplementation with 24-hour sodium chloride 0.9% is superior to sodium bicarbonate for the prevention of CIN.

### Sodium bicarbonate therapy for patients with severe metabolic acidaemia in the intensive care unit (BICAR-ICU): a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled, phase 3 trial [^111Ergrr]. Lancet (2018). High credibility.

Acute acidaemia is frequently observed during critical illness. Sodium bicarbonate infusion for the treatment of severe metabolic acidaemia is a possible treatment option but remains controversial, as no studies at the time of writing have examined its effect on clinical outcomes. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate whether sodium bicarbonate infusion would improve these outcomes in critically ill patients.

- **Methods**: We conducted a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled, phase 3 trial. Local investigators screened eligible patients from 26 intensive care units (ICUs) in France. We included adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) who were admitted within 48 hours to the ICU with severe acidaemia (pH ≤ 7.20, PaCO2 ≤ 45 mm Hg, and sodium bicarbonate concentration ≤ 20 mmol/L) and with a total Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of 4 or more or an arterial lactate concentration of 2 mmol/L or more. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), by stratified randomisation with minimisation via a restricted web platform, to receive either no sodium bicarbonate (control group) or a 4.2% intravenous sodium bicarbonate infusion (bicarbonate group) to maintain the arterial pH above 7.30. Our protocol recommended that the volume of each infusion should be within the range of 125–250 mL in 30 minutes, with a maximum of 1000 mL within 24 hours after inclusion. Randomisation criteria were stratified among three prespecified strata: age, sepsis status, and the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) score. The primary outcome was a composite of death from any cause by day 28 and the presence of at least one organ failure.

### Sodium bicarbonate administration for metabolic acidosis in the intensive care unit: a target trial emulation [^1142xg2Q]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

In this target trial emulation, bicarbonate administration was associated with a small but statistically significant reduction in mortality for patients with metabolic acidosis. The benefit may be smaller than previously estimated, and large sample sizes would be required to demonstrate this effect in a randomized trial. Our analysis of high-volume observational data using robust statistical methods supports the use of bicarbonate in patients with metabolic acidosis beyond the populations targeted in ongoing randomized trials.

### A randomized controlled trial of sodium bicarbonate in neonatal resuscitation-effect on immediate outcome [^111m6BZg]. Resuscitation (2004). High credibility.

Very little evidence is available that supports or disproves the use of medications in neonatal resuscitation. In this randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the effect of sodium bicarbonate given during neonatal resuscitation on survival and neurological outcome at discharge.

- **Subjects and methods**: Consecutively born asphyxiated neonates continuing to need positive pressure ventilation at 5 minutes of life received either sodium bicarbonate or 5% dextrose. The study group was given intravenous sodium bicarbonate solution, 4 ml/kg (1.8 meq./kg), over 3–5 minutes. This solution was prepared by diluting 7.5% sodium bicarbonate (0.9 meq./ml) with distilled water in a 1:1 ratio. The placebo group received 4 ml/kg of undiluted 5% dextrose at a similar rate. The surviving neonates were evaluated for their neurological status at discharge. Primary outcome variable: death or abnormal neurological examination at discharge. Secondary outcome variables: encephalopathy, multi-organ dysfunction, intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), and arterial pH at 6 hours.

- **Results**: Twenty-seven babies were randomized to receive sodium bicarbonate (bicarb group), and 28 to receive 5% dextrose. Eighteen of the 27 (66.7%) babies in the bicarb group and 19 of the 28 babies (68%) in the dextrose group survived to discharge (P = 0.84). Twenty-eight percent of the survivors in the bicarb group and 32% of the survivors in the dextrose group were neurologically abnormal at discharge (P = 0.10). The composite primary outcome of death or abnormal neurological examination at discharge was similar in both groups.

### Clinical efficacy of sodium bicarbonate in treating pediatric metabolic acidosis with varying level of acid-base balance parameters: a real-world study [^1158Z3Vt]. BMC Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is an acid-base imbalance that depletes the body's buffers, resulting in a decrease in serum bicarbonate (HCO3−) concentration, which leads to a secondary reduction in carbon dioxide (PaCO2) levels and a decrease in blood pH. Critically ill patients, such as those with sepsis, severe hypoxemia, and cardiogenic shock, are often susceptible to developing metabolic acidosis, which can cause hemodynamic instability, reduced myocardial contractility, impaired cellular oxygen supply and mitochondrial oxygen consumption, compromised catecholamine reactivity, and an increased risk of mortality. Moderate to severe metabolic acidosis affects around 8.4% of ICU patients, with ICU and hospital mortality rates of 17.3% and 21.5%, respectively.

To restore normal cardiovascular function and oxygen delivery to tissues, intravenous sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3, SB) solutions have been commonly administered over the past two decades, with the assumption that SB raises extracellular pH by delivering sodium ions and bicarbonate, consequently increasing extracellular strong ion difference (SID), with the sodium ion remaining in its monovalent form. Despite the commonality of this clinical practice, there is inadequate assessment of the effect of SB on biochemical parameters, with controversy remaining as to whether treating metabolic acidosis with SB results in improved clinical outcomes. Studies have found that treating adults and children with severe metabolic acidosis with SB does not improve mortality or Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score.

### Tazicef [^115v3Dbm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Tazicef is less stable in sodium bicarbonate injection than in other IV fluids and is not recommended as a diluent. Solutions of Tazicef in 5% dextrose injection and 0.9% sodium chloride injection are stable for at least 6 hours at room temperature in plastic tubing, drip chambers, and volume control devices of common IV infusion sets.

Ceftazidime at a concentration of 4 mg/mL has been found compatible for 24 hours at room temperature or for 7 days under refrigeration in 0.9% sodium chloride injection or 5% dextrose injection when admixed with: cefuroxime sodium (ZINACEF®) 3 mg/mL, heparin 10 or 50 U/mL, or potassium chloride 10 or 40 mEq/L.

Vancomycin solution exhibits a physical incompatibility when mixed with a number of drugs, including ceftazidime. The likelihood of precipitation with ceftazidime is dependent on the concentrations of vancomycin and ceftazidime present. It is therefore recommended that when both drugs are to be administered by intermittent IV infusion, they be given separately, flushing the IV lines with one of the compatible IV fluids between the administration of these two agents.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter before administration whenever solution and container permit.

As with other cephalosporins, Tazicef powder, as well as solutions, tend to darken depending on storage conditions; however, within the stated recommendations, product potency is not adversely affected.

### Association between the use of sodium bicarbonate and mortality in acute kidney injury using marginal structural Cox model [^117K8HeF]. Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Acute kidney injury with metabolic acidosis is common in critically ill patients. This study assessed the associations between the use of IV sodium bicarbonate and the mortality of patients with acute kidney injury and acidosis.

- **Design**: The study was conducted using data from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, which included several ICUs such as the coronary care unit, cardiac surgery recovery unit, medical ICU, surgical ICU, and trauma-neuro ICU. A marginal structural Cox model was used to assess the relationship between the receipt of sodium bicarbonate and hospital mortality. It allowed pH, PaCO2, creatinine, and bicarbonate concentration as time-varying predictors of sodium bicarbonate exposure while adjusting for baseline characteristics, including age, gender, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, acute kidney injury stage, Elixhauser score, quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II.

- **Setting**: A large U.S.-based critical care database named Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care.

- **Patients**: Patients with Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes acute kidney injury stage greater than or equal to 1 (> 1.5 baseline creatinine) and one measurement of acidosis (pH ≤ 7.2). Baseline creatinine was estimated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation.

- **Interventions**: None.

- **Measurements and main results**: Of the 3,406 eligible patients, 836 (24.5%) had received sodium bicarbonate treatment. Patients who received sodium bicarbonate treatment had a higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at baseline, indicating a more severe disease state. Further results require access to the full-text article.

### Flecainide overdose-induced wide-complex tachyarrhythmia treated with sodium bicarbonate infusion [^1133izEn]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Flecainide is a medication used to treat supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Cases of overdose are rare; however, they can lead to significant cardiac effects. In previous cases of flecainide toxicity, treatment with sodium bicarbonate, intravenous lipid emulsion, and amiodarone have been reported to be effective in preventing cardiovascular collapse and reestablishing baseline rhythm. Here, we present a case of a man in his 40s who presented with flecainide overdose with wide-complex tachycardia that was treated with intravenous sodium bicarbonate following the failure of amiodarone to normalize the QRS interval.

### Sodium bicarbonate infusion during resuscitation of infants at birth [^115e4kb5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

For many years, intravenous sodium bicarbonate has been used to reverse acidosis during newborn resuscitation. However, controversy surrounds its use. Most of the evidence comes from studies in animals, adult humans, or uncontrolled, descriptive experiments. Despite the lack of evidence from the human neonatal population and concerns about its safety, some international resuscitation guidelines still recommend the use of sodium bicarbonate in the resuscitation of newborns.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether an intravenous infusion of sodium bicarbonate, compared to placebo or no treatment, reduces mortality and morbidity (particularly regarding neurodevelopmental outcome) in infants receiving resuscitation in the delivery room at birth.

- **Search strategy**: We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. Searches were conducted in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 - September 2005), EMBASE (1980 - September 2005), CINAHL (1982 - September 2005), and Pediatric Research (1987 - September 2005). Unpublished trials were sought by handsearching the conference proceedings of the American Pediatric Society/Society for Pediatric Research (1990–2005) and the European Society for Paediatric Research (1993–2005).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of newborn infants receiving sodium bicarbonate infusion during any resuscitation in the delivery room at birth.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed trials.

### Sodium fate after sodium bicarbonate infusion: Influence of altered acid-base status [^114nqXgS]. American Journal of Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

We have previously investigated the fate of administered bicarbonate infused as a hypertonic solution in animals with each of the four chronic acid-base disorders. Those studies did not address the fate of sodium, the coadministered cation.

- **Methods**: We examined baseline total body water (TBW), Na+ space, HCO3- space, and urinary sodium and bicarbonate excretion after acute hypertonic NaHCO3 infusion (1-N solution, 5 mmol/kg body weight) in dogs with each of the four chronic acid-base disorders. Observations were made at 30, 60, and 90 minutes postinfusion. Retained sodium that remains osmotically active distributes in an apparent space that approximates TBW. Na+ space that exceeds TBW uncovers nonosmotic sodium storage.

- **Results**: Na+ space approximated TBW at all times in normal and hyperbicarbonatemic animals (metabolic alkalosis and respiratory acidosis) but exceeded TBW by ~30% in hypobicarbonatemic animals (metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis). Such osmotic inactivation was detected at 30 minutes and remained stable. The pooled data revealed that Na+ space corrected for TBW was independent of the initial blood pH but correlated with initial extracellular bicarbonate concentration (y = -0.01x + 1.4, p = 0.002). The fate of administered sodium and bicarbonate (internal distribution and urinary excretion) was closely linked.

- **Conclusions**: This study demonstrates that hypobicarbonatemic animals have a Na+ space that exceeds TBW after an acute infusion of hypertonic NaHCO3, indicating osmotic inactivation of a fraction of retained sodium.

### Sodium bicarbonate versus sodium chloride for preventing contrast-associated acute kidney injury in critically ill patients: A randomized controlled trial [^116kBFti]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). High credibility.

To test whether hydration with bicarbonate rather than isotonic sodium chloride reduces the risk of contrast-associated acute kidney injury in critically ill patients, a prospective, double-blind, multicenter, randomized controlled study was conducted.

- **Setting**: Three French ICUs.
- **Patients**: Critically ill patients with stable renal function (n = 307) who received intravascular contrast media.
- **Interventions**: Hydration with 0.9% sodium chloride or 1.4% sodium bicarbonate administered with the same infusion protocol: 3 mL/kg during 1 hour before and 1 mL/kg/hr during 6 hours after contrast medium exposure.
- **Measurements and main results**: The primary endpoint was the development of contrast-associated acute kidney injury, as defined by the Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria, 72 hours after contrast exposure. Patients randomized to the bicarbonate group (n = 151) showed a higher urinary pH at the end of the infusion than patients randomized to the saline group (n = 156) (6.7 ± 2.1 vs 6.2 ± 1.8, respectively; p < 0.001). No significant differences in the occurrence of acute kidney injury were observed between the groups. All-cause mortality rates at 72 hours were similar in both groups (6.1% for bicarbonate vs. 6.4% for saline; p = 0.99).

Conclusions indicated that except for urinary pH, there was no benefit observed in preventing contrast-associated acute kidney injury with the use of sodium bicarbonate over sodium chloride.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^113BU5KQ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Acidemia has been implicated in contributing to cardiovascular instability and decreased responsiveness to catecholamines, and severe lactic acidosis is associated with increased mortality. This has led to the general belief and clinical practice that severe acidemia (usually defined as a pH ≤ 7.10 to 7.20) should be corrected in the setting of lactic acidosis while awaiting definitive treatment of or response to treatment for the underlying cause. When surveyed, 86% of nephrologists and 67% of intensivists would initiate buffer treatment for patients with lactic acidosis, and 87% of nephrologists and 75% of intensivists would target a pH ≥ 7.2.

Despite widespread use, it is unknown whether treating extracellular acidosis with sodium bicarbonate affects clinical outcomes. Prior data have indicated that sodium bicarbonate administration does not improve hemodynamics in critically ill patients with lactic acidosis. Interestingly, there is no effect seen even in patients with severe acidemia (pH 6.90–7.20) and concomitant vasopressor use. Various studies, including the recent analysis of the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database, have found that sodium bicarbonate does not improve mortality in critically ill patients with severe acidemia (pH < 7.20) or in septic patients with metabolic acidosis, except in patients with concomitant acute kidney injury. Importantly, most publications evaluating the effect of supplemental bicarbonate therapy in patients with lactic acidosis have been observational or retrospective.

### Excessive sodium bicarbonate infusion may result in osmotic demyelination syndrome during treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis: A case report [^114AwAT8]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

We present a case wherein diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) was treated with a large amount of sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride, resulting in the development of osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS).

- **Case presentation**: Our patient was a 29-year-old male with a history of post-surgical repair for ventricular septal defect. Upon arrival, the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was E2M4V3. Laboratory examinations revealed leukocytosis, severe metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, and hyperglycemia. His consciousness status and hemodynamics improved after resuscitation (GCS: E3M6Ve). However, they declined at the 40th hour of admission and dropped to GCS E2M2Ve. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multifocal abnormal signal intensity changes in the whole brain stem. The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus was made during the hospitalization period. The patient exhibited improved consciousness status after 17-day medical care at the ICU.

- **Conclusions**: We recommend that in the case of DKA, the correction of hypokalemia should be prioritized during treatment. Sodium bicarbonate infusion should be reserved for pH < 6.9. In addition, close monitoring of the serum sodium level and prompt actions to lower it if it exceeds the threshold may be necessary.

### Excessive sodium bicarbonate infusion may result in osmotic demyelination syndrome during treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis: A case report [^1148ncfN]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

In emergency room or ICU settings, severe metabolic acidosis is frequently encountered, and sodium bicarbonate infusion is considered an important initial treatment to correct acid-base status. In the reported case, a total of 30 ampules of sodium bicarbonate was administered over a 16-hour period. The sodium content of these fluids was 510 meq, equivalent to that of 1 liter of 3% sodium chloride. Frequent ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) and hypotension further complicated the clinician's decision-making process. First-line clinicians may attribute this status to severe hypokalemia and acidosis, often prescribing sodium bicarbonate and potassium supplements liberally to correct the electrolyte disturbance as early as possible. However, the osmotic changes caused by sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride remain unaddressed.

Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) is widely known to be linked to the rapid correction of hyponatremia. Intensive monitoring of serum sodium levels has been suggested for ODS, though in the clinical setting of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), only potassium monitoring has typically been emphasized. This case implies that both potassium and sodium levels must be monitored carefully in the initial hours of resuscitation, and clinicians should remain aware of the possibility of a rapid increase in serum sodium levels. In life-threatening conditions, potassium supplements should be administered primarily as indicated by previous reports, and the use of sodium bicarbonate should be refrained from until the serum pH decreases to less than 6.9.

DKA with concurrent hypokalemia, arrhythmia, and unstable hemodynamics could present significant challenges.

### Effect of sodium bicarbonate on systolic blood pressure in CKD: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113ncVZM]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Individuals with CKD are at a higher risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Acidosis is positively correlated with CKD progression and elevated systolic blood pressure. Sodium bicarbonate is an efficacious treatment of acidosis, although this may also increase systolic blood pressure. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we summarize the evidence evaluating systolic blood pressure and antihypertensive medication change (which may indicate systolic blood pressure change) in response to sodium bicarbonate therapy in individuals with CKD.

- **Methods**: Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Excerpta Medica Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and World Health Organization (WHO) trials registry databases were searched for randomized control trials where sodium bicarbonate was compared with placebo/usual care in CKD stage G1–5 non-dialysis-dependent populations. Random effects meta-analyses were used to evaluate changes in systolic blood pressure and blood pressure-modifying drugs after sodium bicarbonate intervention.

- **Results**: Fourteen randomized control trials (2110 individuals, median follow-up 27 [interquartile range 97] weeks, mean age 60 [SD 10] years, mean systolic blood pressure 136 [SD 17] mm Hg, mean eGFR 38 [SD 10] ml/min, mean serum bicarbonate 22 [SD 4] mmol/L) were eligible for inclusion. Meta-analysis suggested that sodium bicarbonate did not influence systolic blood pressure in individuals with CKD stage G1–5. Results were consistent when stratifying by dose of sodium bicarbonate or duration.

### Sodium bicarbonate administration during ongoing resuscitation is associated with increased return of spontaneous circulation [^111MxTj2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Sodium bicarbonate is frequently used for patients unresponsive to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Its use may be associated with longer resuscitation duration as well as more severe metabolic acidosis. We applied a new analytical method based on a matched case-control study design to control for potential confounders.

- **Basic procedures**: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients resuscitated in an emergency department for at least 20 minutes, unless there was any return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) within the time frame, were analyzed. Patients without ROSC for 20 minutes of CPR were matched to those with ROSC based on initial bicarbonate level categorized using cutoff points of 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 mEq/L, and their observation durations were trimmed to match their pairs. The association between sodium bicarbonate and ROSC was examined using conditional logistic regression analysis.

- **Main findings**: Two matched groups, one with ROSC and the other without (both n = 258), were generated. Sodium bicarbonate administration and its total cumulative dose were significantly associated with an increased ROSC, with odds ratios for ROSC of 1.86 (95% confidence interval, 1.09–3.16; p = 0.022) and 1.18 (per 20 mEq; 95% CI, 1.04–1.33; p = 0.008), respectively. The positive associations remained unchanged after multivariable adjustment, with odds ratios for ROSC of 2.49 (95% CI, 1.33–4.65; p = 0.004) and 1.27 (95% CI, 1.11–1.47; p = 0.001), respectively.

- **Principal conclusion**: Sodium bicarbonate administration during CPR in the emergency department was associated with increased ROSC.

### Do intravenous fluid substitutions influence methotrexate clearance? An unanticipated impact of an intravenous sodium bicarbonate drug shortage [^114egeii]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2020). Low credibility.

National drug shortages of essential medications for childhood cancer have increasingly posed a challenge in the treatment of patients. The efficacy of standardized supportive care practices to avoid treatment-related toxicities may be limited during these drug shortages. High-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) plays a critical role in modern treatment protocols for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and requires stringent supportive care measures to mitigate toxicity. As a result of a national intravenous (IV) sodium bicarbonate shortage, institutional standard HDMTX supportive care guidelines had to be modified. We describe the unanticipated consequences on HDMTX clearance.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective chart review assessing the impact of alternative compositions of IV fluids on the mean 24-h methotrexate levels (Cp ss) of 25 patients receiving 76 total HDMTX infusions at Texas Children's Hospital Cancer Center from March to October 2017. During the sodium bicarbonate drug shortage, all patients received IV hydration consisting of either dextrose 5%, 0.45% normal saline (D5 ½ NS-Group A) or dextrose 5%, 0.2% normal saline (D5 ¼ NS-Group B).

- **Results**: Patients receiving a higher total sodium dose demonstrated significantly lower Cp ss (25.36 ± 16.6 μMol) compared to patients receiving less sodium (53.9 ± 37.9 μMol; P < .001).

- **Conclusions**: Our report shows that in the setting of an IV sodium bicarbonate shortage, the composition of hydration IV fluids may affect methotrexate clearance. Patients who received a higher sodium load had a lower 24-h methotrexate level.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^116pAZvm]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

The literature to support sodium bicarbonate use during cardiac arrest is mixed. Overall, most studies have found that either there is no effect on outcomes or there is worse survival with bicarbonate use. However, it is possible that worse outcomes are seen in the sodium bicarbonate groups, as providers might be more likely to give base therapy to more severely ill patients.

In 2006, Vukmir et al. found no improvement in outcomes when sodium bicarbonate was administered for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. However, they noted improved survival in the subset of patients with prolonged arrest of more than 15 minutes (32.8% in the bicarbonate group vs. 15.4% in the control group; p = 0.007). A retrospective study from Bar-Joseph et al. in 2005 also found that hospitals routinely using sodium bicarbonate — defined as institutions who used bicarbonate in more than 50% of arrests and within 10 minutes of the first epinephrine dose — had higher rates of return of spontaneous circulation and favorable neurologic outcomes compared with sites that did not use sodium bicarbonate as frequently. However, the sites more apt to use sodium bicarbonate also started ACLS interventions, including the first epinephrine dose, quicker than hospitals that did not use bicarbonate as often.

Overall, these studies suggest that if there is any potential benefit to bicarbonate administration during cardiac arrest, the timing of administration during resuscitation may be key and requires further study.

### Whither the bicarbonate era [^116xB4R5]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

To the editor:

For metabolic acidosis, beyond treating the underlying cause, correcting hypoxemia, and establishing good perfusion, sodium bicarbonate is often given at variable arbitrary thresholds of depressed blood pH. Recently, Zanella and colleagues employed extracorporeal removal of chloride by electrodialysis in healthy pigs made acidemic by either lactic acid infusion or hypoventilation (CO2 retention). By physically drawing off chloride and establishing a local separation of charge, blood electroneutrality at the membrane is immediately reestablished by the hydrolysis of water to yield a hydroxyl ion that instantly combines with CO2 to form bicarbonate. The authors show the feasibility of quantitatively increasing bicarbonate in this fashion for both forms of acidosis without the associated and unwanted hypernatremia and volume loading that can occur with intravenous sodium bicarbonate administration.

The accompanying editorialists proclaim the post-bicarbonate era with this study that illustrates a major tenet of the Stewart approach to acid–base chemistry and its superiority over other approaches to understanding acid–base physiology and pathophysiology. In Stewart's paradigm, H+, OH−, HCO3−, and CO32− are relegated to the status of dependent variables; that is, they can only be formed from the differential movements and exchanges of independent strong ions (Na+, K+, and Cl−) that disturb electroneutrality, which is immediately corrected by the hydrolysis of water and reaction with CO2.

Although the heuristics of the Stewart analysis are valid, I rem

### ABCs of base therapy in neonatology: Role of acetate, bicarbonate, citrate and lactate [^112s7Zxf]. Journal of Perinatology (2025). Low credibility.

Use of sodium bicarbonate in the NICUs

An international survey completed in 2023 showed that, out of a pool of 134 physicians, around 91.2% used NaHCO₃ to treat metabolic acidosis in their neonatal practice. Although there are known adverse effects associated with NaHCO₃ administration, such as fluctuations in cerebral blood flow, cardiovascular hemodynamics, and increased rates of severe IVH in preterm babies, its use remains a common treatment for metabolic acidosis in NICUs worldwide. Another survey completed in Italy showed similar results and also pointed out that dosage and time of infusion varied widely across the centers.

With no standard guidelines on indications, dosing, or speed of infusion, there is a risk of unsafe treatments, highlighting the need to clarify these dosages. Commonly, the following equation has been used to determine the base deficit correction: Full Correction Dose (mmol) = 0.3 x base deficit (mmol/L) x the weight (kg). A prevailing practice is to administer only half the dose and reassess the need for the remainder. However, this dose may be excessive due to variations in base deficit as explained previously.

We prefer the alternate approach to use 1–2 mEq/kg by slow infusions, reassess acid-base status and hemodynamics, and then repeat the dose as needed. The use of a lower dose could potentially help reduce the risk of hypokalemia, hypernatremia, hypocalcemia, rebound alkalemia, and water-sodium overload.

### Sodium bicarbonate administration for metabolic acidosis in the intensive care unit: a target trial emulation [^112XZV5n]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Strengths and limitations

Strengths of our study include the relatively large patient cohort derived from multiple ICUs, which makes the results generalizable across a wide population. Another strength is the robust statistical methodology underpinning the target trial emulation. The parametric G-formula can be sensitive to model misspecification; however, our model was shown to be very consistent in predicting the "natural course" across all subgroups evaluated. We also performed a sensitivity analysis using modeling based on treatment allocation, which shows similar results to the primary analysis.

The study is subject to all the inherent limitations of retrospective research, including data availability and the potential for coding errors. In particular, there were no data available prior to ICU admission or following ICU discharge, including blood results, details of fluid resuscitation, or the administration of bicarbonate therapy. This meant that the primary trial emulation using G-formulation could not be extended to 30-day mortality outside the ICU, as the daily values of covariates were not available. For this reason, we performed an additional sensitivity analysis with REM, which provides reassurance that the reduction in mortality was sustained to 30 days. We were also unable to analyze specific details regarding bicarbonate administration (e.g. time stamp for the hour of administration, delivery as a bolus vs. infusion) as the dataset only records the total daily dose of bicarbonate therapy.

### Sodium bicarbonate administration for metabolic acidosis in the intensive care unit: A target trial emulation [^1123Wb5s]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

We identified 6157 eligible admissions, and a flowchart of patient selection is shown in electronic supplementary Figure S2. A total of 1764 patients (29%) were treated with bicarbonate, and further details regarding the timing and quantity of administration can be found in the electronic supplementary material (Tables S4-S5). The median cumulative bicarbonate dose was 150 mmol for the whole population, but varied between 100 and 200 mmol in the subgroups depending on their illness severity. The rate of administration by year of admission is shown in electronic supplementary Figure S3 and suggests a non-significant trend toward increasing use over time.

- **Population characteristics**:

Characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1, with a breakdown comparing patients who did and did not receive sodium bicarbonate therapy. Patients who received bicarbonate had higher APACHE III scores and more severe acidosis. They also had a greater requirement for vasoactive support and were more likely to receive RRT. Unadjusted ICU mortality was significantly greater in the cohort who received bicarbonate therapy, as seen in the survival curves in Fig. 1.

Table 1 provides population characteristics, with data presented as n (%), mean (± standard deviation), and median (interquartile range). There were no missing data related to the above parameters for all included admissions. Cumulative ICU fluid balance on the day of meeting eligibility criteria includes balanced solutions such as compound sodium lactate or plasmalyte solutions and unbalanced solutions such as crystalloid solutions with a strong ion difference.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^111BPJWb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Use of sodium bicarbonate to treat metabolic acidosis is intuitive, yet data suggest that not all patients benefit from this therapy.

- **Objective**: In this narrative review, we describe the physiology behind commonly encountered nontoxicologic causes of metabolic acidosis, highlight potential harm from the indiscriminate administration of sodium bicarbonate in certain scenarios, and provide evidence-based recommendations to assist emergency physicians in the rational use of sodium bicarbonate.

- **Discussion**: Sodium bicarbonate can be administered as a hypertonic push, as a resuscitation fluid, or as an infusion. Lactic acidosis and cardiac arrest are two common scenarios where there is limited benefit to the routine use of sodium bicarbonate. However, certain circumstances, such as patients with concomitant acute kidney injury and lactic acidosis, may benefit from sodium bicarbonate. Patients with cardiac arrest secondary to sodium channel blockade or hyperkalemia also benefit from sodium bicarbonate therapy. Recent data suggest that the use of sodium bicarbonate in diabetic ketoacidosis does not confer improved patient outcomes and may cause harm in pediatric patients. Available evidence suggests that alkalinization of urine in rhabdomyolysis does not improve patient-centered outcomes. Finally, patients with nongap acidosis benefit from sodium bicarbonate supplementation.

- **Conclusions**: Empiric use of sodium bicarbonate in patients with nontoxicologic causes of metabolic acidosis is not warranted and likely does not improve patient-centered outcomes, except in select cases.

### Clinical efficacy of sodium bicarbonate in treating pediatric metabolic acidosis with varying level of acid-base balance parameters: A real-world study [^112MysMg]. BMC Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Sodium bicarbonate (SB) infusion is commonly used to correct metabolic acidosis, but its clinical efficacy remains controversial. This study aims to investigate whether acid-base balance parameters should be a consideration for administering SB treatment.

- **Methods**: Children with metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.35 and bicarbonate < 22 mmol/L) who were treated with or without a 50 mg/ml SB injection were grouped and extracted from a retrospective cohort database of the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. The interaction between acid-base balance parameters and SB treatment on mortality was analyzed through mortality curves and cross-effect models. Logistic regression was conducted to estimate the risk of death following SB treatment in the overall population as well as in subgroups, and potential confounding factors were adjusted for. After employing propensity score matching to account for confounding factors, further analysis was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of SB treatment within each chloride subgroup.

- **Results**: A total of 5,865 children with metabolic acidosis were enrolled, of which 2,462 (42.0%) received SB treatment. In the overall population, it was found that SB treatment did not reduce hospital mortality or 28-day mortality. Interactions between acid-base balance parameters (chloride and anion gap) and SB treatment on mortality were observed. Subgroup analysis clarified that when chloride levels were below 107 mmol/L, children treated with SB had higher in-hospital mortality (29.8% vs. 14.9%) and 28-day mortality (26.5% vs. 13.4%), with adjusted ORs of 2.065 (95%…

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^1138Kgtw]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

The authors conducted a narrative review of the available literature on bicarbonate therapy in selected topics. The literature search was completed using Google Scholar and PubMed databases for articles written in English, published between November 1990 and November 2022. Search terms included "bicarbonate", "cardiac arrest", "lactate", "lactic acidosis", "diabetic ketoacidosis", "rhabdomyolysis", "acidosis", and "acidemia". Abstracts were reviewed by two authors for appropriateness, and discrepancies were adjudicated by a third author. Preference was given to recent randomized trials and meta-analyses. Additional articles were identified if judged relevant in references from selected articles. A total of 143 abstracts were reviewed, from which 27 original research studies and 4 meta-analyses were included.

- **Levels of evidence and strength of recommendations**: The definitions used for grading the level of evidence and the strength of recommendations were adapted from the method used by the American College of Emergency Physicians Clinical Policies and are summarized in Table 1.

### SPL drug information for sodium bicarbonate [^112G4Bcu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Use of sodium bicarbonate IV in pregnant patients during all trimesters is advised only if the benefits outweigh potential risks. Sodium bicarbonate has been assigned to pregnancy category C by the FDA. There are no animal or human reproductive data. Some experts consider its use as an antacid during human pregnancy to be relatively contraindicated due to the availability of preferable therapeutic agents. Therefore, sodium bicarbonate should only be administered during pregnancy when the benefit outweighs the risk.

### Sodium bicarbonate supplements for treating acute kidney injury [^111ev3et]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common, serious, but potentially treatable condition. Because AKI is often associated with acidosis, it has become common practice to recommend the administration of sodium bicarbonate to correct acid imbalance.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of the use of sodium bicarbonate for people with AKI. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality, and secondary outcome measures were patients' need for renal replacement therapy, return to baseline kidney function, and overall survival.

- **Search methods**: In November 2011, we searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register using keywords relevant to this review. The register is populated using searches of Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, and handsearching records from renal-related journals and conference proceedings.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the use of sodium bicarbonate supplements, administered by any route, for the treatment of adults with AKI were to be included. The search strategy did not restrict inclusion based on an upper age limit or publication language. We did not consider inclusion of studies that investigated the use of sodium bicarbonate for AKI prevention.

- **Data collection and analysis**: All authors planned to independently assess and extract information. Information was to be collected on methods, participants, interventions, and outcomes. Results were to be expressed as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or as mean differences (MD) for continuous data.

### Sodium bicarbonate therapy for acute respiratory acidosis [^115yXbBJ]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2021). Low credibility.

Respiratory acidosis is commonly present in patients with respiratory failure. The usual treatment of hypercapnia is to increase ventilation. During the recent surge of COVID-19, respiratory acidosis unresponsive to increased mechanical ventilatory support was common. Increasing mechanical ventilation comes at the expense of barotrauma and hemodynamic compromise from increasing positive end-expiratory pressures or minute ventilation. Treating acute respiratory acidemia with sodium bicarbonate remains controversial.

There are no randomized controlled trials of administration of sodium bicarbonate for respiratory acidemia. A recent review concluded that alkali therapy for mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis might be useful but was based on conflicting and not conclusive literature regarding metabolic acidosis. This strategy should not be extrapolated to the treatment of respiratory acidemia. Low tidal volume ventilation in acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has beneficial effects associated with permissive hypercapnia. Whether the putative benefits will be negated by the administration of alkali is not known. Hypercapnic acidosis is well tolerated, with few adverse effects as long as tissue perfusion and oxygenation are maintained.

There is a lack of clinical evidence that the administration of sodium bicarbonate for respiratory acidosis has a net benefit; in fact, there are potential risks associated with it.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^117RtCV8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

In summary, there is no mortality benefit or demonstrated improvement in hemodynamics with the use of sodium bicarbonate in lactic acidosis, although emerging data suggest patients with persistent metabolic acidosis and acute kidney injury may benefit from an infusion of bicarbonate after initial resuscitation. Emphasis should be placed on the treatment of the underlying cause of the acidosis.

- **Recommendation**: The routine use of bicarbonate supplementation for lactic acidosis and shock states is not recommended. There may be a role for an infusion of sodium bicarbonate after initial resuscitation in patients with acute kidney injury and pH < 7.2, although data are limited, and ongoing trials are evaluating benefit (Level of evidence: B).

- **Cardiac arrest**: The benefit of rapid pushes of ampules of sodium bicarbonate therapy in cardiac arrest is controversial. Decreased perfusion leads to hypoxia, anaerobic glycolysis, and generation of lactate. In addition, cessation of spontaneous ventilation causes buildup of carbon dioxide, decreases coronary perfusion pressure, and contributes to a mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis. Acidemia has detrimental effects on hemodynamics, increases myocardial irritability, and lowers the threshold for dysrhythmias. Indeed, the use of sodium bicarbonate was initially part of Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) guidelines dating back to 1976. However, over the years, data emerged that did not show improvement in resuscitation outcomes with bicarbonate supplementation, thus calling into question the routine use of sodium bicarbonate during resuscitation.

### Comparison of short-term infusion regimens of N-acetylcysteine plus intravenous fluids, sodium bicarbonate plus intravenous fluids, and intravenous fluids alone for prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy in the emergency department [^1158699D]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

There is no evidence regarding the several short-term prophylaxis protocols for contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) that may be most feasibly convenient in emergency settings.

- **Objectives**: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacies of short-term CIN prophylaxis protocols of normal saline, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) plus saline, and sodium bicarbonate plus saline in emergency department (ED) patients at moderate or high risk of CIN after receiving intravenous (IV) contrast agent.

- **Methods**: This single-center, randomized, nonblinded clinical trial was conducted in the ED with adult patients requiring contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT). Patients with moderate to high risk of CIN according to the Mehran risk score, who consented to participate, were eligible. Patients with continuous renal replacement therapy or who reported contrast allergy were excluded. Enrolled patients were randomly assigned to receive 150 mg/kg NAC in 1000 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl), 150 mEq of sodium bicarbonate in 1000 mL of 0.9% NaCl, or 1000 mL of IV saline infusion, all given at 350 mL/hr for 3 hours. All of the patients were administered less than 100 mL of nonionic, low-osmolality contrast agent. The primary outcome of CIN was defined as a 25% increase or a greater than 0.5 mg/dL increase in the serum creatinine level 48 to 72 hours later compared with the baseline measurement.

- **Results**: A total of 107 patients were randomized to NAC (n = 36), sodium bicarbonate (n = 36), and saline prophylaxis (n = 35). The mean age of the patients was 71 years.

### Excessive sodium bicarbonate infusion may result in osmotic demyelination syndrome during treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis: A case report [^112apFZT]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

Several case reports have described the relationship between hyperglycemia and osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). In one such case report, a type 2 diabetic and cirrhotic patient presented with several neurologic symptoms following the ingestion of large amounts of sugar-containing foods and was diagnosed with ODS. During admission, the patient had serum sodium levels in the range of 133–144 mmol/l. The authors concluded that ODS resulted from sudden hyperglycemia. In another instance, a patient presented with a serum glucose level of 106 mmol/l (1908 mg/dl) that declined to 60 mmol/l (1080 mg/dl) in 6 hours. The serum sodium level simultaneously elevated from 135 to 159 mmol/l. Both cases did not report hyponatremia but displayed abrupt serum osmolality changes.

Treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) involves the administration of intravenous fluids, potassium supplements, and insulin. A systematic review concluded that bicarbonate therapy provided no clinical advantages in the management of DKA. A report suggested that bicarbonate infusion can be administered if the serum pH is less than 7.0. Furthermore, some side effects of bicarbonate therapy have been reported, including cerebral edema, hypokalemia, and paradoxical central nervous system acidosis.

### Effect of sodium bicarbonate on systolic blood pressure in CKD: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114sinoA]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

As a surrogate of sodium bicarbonate therapy, we explored serum bicarbonate after therapy; however, we note the high heterogeneity in this analysis. This intriguing finding can be a sign of poor adherence to the intervention, perhaps because of medication tolerance, the need for up-titration of sodium bicarbonate to counterbalance the ongoing intake of high acid-containing Western diets, or interindividual variability in response to sodium bicarbonate. Indeed, high interindividual variability has been shown across a number of independent studies and requires more evaluation.

This systematic review and meta-analysis is strengthened by several factors. We included a larger number of trials compared with previous meta-analyses, spanning more than 2,000 participants. We used stringent inclusion criteria limited to RCTs and performed a risk-of-bias assessment using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. We also conducted several subgroup analyses and meta-regression to ascertain the role of potential confounders.

However, we also acknowledge some limitations. First, systolic blood pressure and/or antihypertensive medication change was not a primary or secondary outcome for a number of studies, and this can undermine confidence in the effect measured. Moreover, treatment allocation is not randomized, thus antihypertensive medication analyses are prone to confounding by indication. Second, there was a paucity of RCTs that account for bidirectional changes in medication data. Third, the eligibility criteria of the included studies excluded individuals with uncontrolled high blood pressure, and we are unable to comm

### Esmolol for intractable ventricular arrhythmias in major amitriptyline toxicity [^116g6XMm]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Currently, the first-line therapy for amitriptyline cardiac toxicity involves the generous use of IV sodium bicarbonate to provide sodium ions and alkalinization. Hypertonic sodium at concentrations of 5% to 7.5% has been shown to be equally or more effective than dilute sodium bicarbonate in reversing hypotension and QRS abnormalities. Both are more effective than alkalinization by hyperventilation alone, suggesting that the sodium dose is important. An intra-lipid infusion, also known as 'lipid rescue', was recommended by the toxicologist, commenced at the referring hospital, and continued as recommended, with no apparent benefit. Positive anecdotes of the successful use of intralipid are not supported by clinical trials and human or animal models so far.

- **Second-line therapy**: There is no consensus over the recommended second-line therapies such as magnesium, lidocaine, or phenytoin for ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Sodium channel blockers like flecainide, procainamide, and amiodarone are strongly contraindicated. There are no trials comparing these options, but currently, small case series and animal models favor lidocaine. Physostigmine was observed to reduce anticholinergic symptoms, tachycardia, and arrhythmias, but it was avoided due to adverse events. Long-acting beta-blockers have been used in past decades, with some successful cases, but significant concerns exist about reducing ventricular contractility and worsening shock.

### Sodium bicarbonate administration for metabolic acidosis in the intensive care unit: a target trial emulation [^11161yjg]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

The final major assumption of target trial emulations is exchangeability, which essentially refers to the absence of unmeasured confounders. While our model uses sophisticated methods to account for both baseline and time-varying covariates, it remains possible that additional unresolved confounding may be present. Reassuringly, the E values presented in Fig. 2 suggest that a reasonably large unknown or unmeasured confounder would need to be present to invalidate the results.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^116f3UJa]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Several studies suggest a potential role for bicarbonate therapy in the recovery phase of DKA. After volume resuscitation, bicarbonate is regenerated, but may be offset by the development of hyperchloremia as ketoacids are preferentially excreted over chloride anions. Additionally, patients with persistent kidney injury and reduced production of renal bicarbonate may theoretically benefit from bicarbonate administration to correct this relative bicarbonate deficiency.

Two adult RCTs found quicker reversal of acidosis with bicarbonate therapy at 2 hours; however, this benefit was not sustained beyond this duration. There were no significant differences in glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, tissue oxygenation, or cerebrospinal fluid acidosis, though increased rates of hypokalemia were observed. Finally, two studies found paradoxical worsening of ketonemia with bicarbonate therapy, theorized to be due to augmented hepatic ketogenesis.

- **Recommendation**: Sodium bicarbonate therapy in the initial resuscitation or recovery phase of DKA is not recommended and may cause harm in pediatric patients, although data in patients with severe acidosis (pH < 7.0) and hyperkalemia are lacking (Level of evidence: B).
