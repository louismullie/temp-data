## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what laboratory tests are used to evaluate laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) and how to approach them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical entity and why LPR is diagnostically challenging. Then, I should verify the guideline-backed diagnostic strategy and where objective testing fits. Next, I will examine each proposed "lab" modality — salivary pepsin, oropharyngeal pH monitoring, and hypopharyngeal-esophageal multichannel impedance-pH (HEMII-pH) — for performance, limitations, and guideline positions. After that, I should review symptom scales and laryngoscopy as adjuncts, not replacements. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and highlight special situations and safety considerations, making sure I reconcile any conflicting statements from the literature as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and diagnostic challenge. LPR is a manifestation of extraesophageal reflux with nonspecific laryngeal symptoms and signs; importantly, there is no universally accepted gold standard, and symptoms or laryngoscopic findings alone correlate poorly with objective reflux, leading to frequent overdiagnosis and overtreatment, so I need to ensure we do not jump to conclusions based on symptoms or laryngoscopy alone [^113uy53E] [^111VpmpA] [^11194HGt].

> Next, I should review the guideline-backed diagnostic strategy. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — guidelines emphasize that in patients with extraesophageal symptoms without typical GERD (heartburn/regurgitation), we should avoid empiric PPI trials and instead pursue objective reflux testing off acid suppression when feasible; laryngoscopy is not sufficient to diagnose LPR, and oropharyngeal/pharyngeal pH monitoring is not routinely recommended due to poor reliability and overlap with controls [^113uy53E] [^1139uEGz] [^115AncAq] [^114WqV4S].

> I will now examine salivary pepsin testing. Wait, let me verify the performance claims. Some studies report sensitivity around 86% and specificity around 68%, and others suggest morning sampling improves yield, but meta-analyses and guidelines show markedly variable and inconsistent performance, with overlap between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals; importantly, ACG advises against salivary pepsin for extraesophageal reflux evaluation, and multiple daily samples may be needed to improve sensitivity, which complicates routine use [^114QT8rv] [^116jJv4D] [^113uy53E] [^115faDvu] [^111kh4RP].

> Now, oropharyngeal pH monitoring with Dx-pH. I should double-check its correlation with gold-standard testing. Multiple studies and guidelines indicate poor concordance with MII-pH, inability to distinguish healthy volunteers from symptomatic patients, and lack of standardized cutoffs; thus, routine oropharyngeal pH monitoring is not recommended for extraesophageal symptoms, and it should not be used to guide diagnosis or therapy decisions [^115AncAq] [^114WqV4S] [^111AY4sb] [^115vnmWT].

> Let me consider hypopharyngeal-esophageal multichannel impedance-pH (HEMII-pH). I need to ensure I frame this correctly: while some call it the "gold standard" for LPR, guidelines still caution there is no perfect test and emphasize that HEMII-pH detects proximal acid and nonacid events and can phenotype reflux; it is the preferred objective modality when available, but access, tolerability, and interpretation expertise remain barriers, and even with HEMII-pH, only a minority of patients with laryngeal symptoms have confirmed reflux, underscoring the need to evaluate alternative etiologies [^112Ts1bx] [^114qQagg] [^113uy53E] [^113hSmH9].

> Hold on, I should verify symptom scales and laryngoscopy as adjuncts, not replacements. The Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) and Reflux Finding Score (RFS) are useful for screening and follow-up, but RSI correlates poorly with objective pharyngeal acid exposure and has limited diagnostic accuracy; newer tools like the Reflux Symptom Score (RSS) and combinations with sign instruments (e.g. RSS+RSA-10) show promising accuracy in research cohorts, yet they remain adjunctive and cannot replace physiologic testing when a definitive reflux diagnosis is needed [^116WniBQ] [^111kh4RP] [^111Sk6Pp] [^11194HGt].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and check for internal consistency. First, screen with RSI/RFS and perform laryngoscopy to exclude other pathology, but do not diagnose LPR on laryngoscopy alone; second, if extraesophageal symptoms persist without typical GERD, prioritize objective testing off PPI when feasible, with HEMII-pH as the preferred modality; third, if HEMII-pH is unavailable, consider prolonged wireless pH monitoring as an alternative that may increase diagnostic yield; fourth, if objective testing is negative, pivot to nonreflux etiologies such as allergy, voice misuse, or functional disorders; fifth, reserve salivary pepsin as a research or highly selected adjunct, recognizing its limitations and the need for multiple samples if used [^113uy53E] [^1168iyJr] [^113hSmH9] [^115faDvu].

> But wait, what about empiric PPI therapy — should it ever be first-line here? I should confirm the stance. For isolated extraesophageal symptoms without typical GERD, guidelines recommend against empiric PPI trials and favor upfront testing; conversely, in patients with typical GERD symptoms, an empiric PPI trial is reasonable, and if PPI-responsive, further testing may be unnecessary unless surgery is contemplated; cost analyses also suggest upfront testing can be more cost-effective than empiric therapy in atypical presentations [^113uy53E] [^117WUyif] [^113hSmH9].

> Next, I should review special situations and safety. In patients with refractory symptoms despite optimized PPI, pH-impedance on therapy can help phenotype ongoing reflux and guide escalation; for those considering antireflux surgery, objective documentation of abnormal reflux off therapy is essential; and with chronic PPI use, I need to remember rare hypomagnesemia, fundic gland polyps, and chromogranin A interference, prompting periodic magnesium assessment in high-risk users and holding PPIs before CgA testing [^113E6eUZ] [^115KRsuW] [^113CGKWR] [^114RnQEu].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "24-hour MII-pH is the gold standard for LPR", but I should correct that nuance. Distal esophageal pH-impedance is the gold standard for GERD, whereas for suspected LPR, hypopharyngeal-esophageal monitoring (HEMII-pH) is the most informative available test to detect proximal reflux events; still, guidelines emphasize there is no perfect test for extraesophageal reflux, so results must be integrated with symptoms, endoscopy, and other etiologies before committing to long-term antireflux therapy [^113uy53E] [^112Ts1bx] [^113hSmH9].

> In summary, I need to ensure the diagnostic approach remains individualized and multimodal: avoid overreliance on symptoms or laryngoscopy, prioritize objective reflux testing off therapy when feasible, recognize the limitations of salivary pepsin and oropharyngeal pH, and maintain a high index of suspicion for nonreflux causes when tests are negative; this measured strategy reduces overtreatment, aligns with contemporary guidelines, and improves the chance of matching therapy to the true underlying pathophysiology [^113uy53E] [^111VpmpA] [^113hSmH9].

---

For suspected laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR), **objective testing is preferred** over empiric therapy [^117WUyif] [^113hSmH9]. The most reliable test is **24-hour hypopharyngeal-esophageal multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH (HEMII-pH)** [^112Ts1bx], which detects acid and non-acid reflux to the hypopharynx and is the current gold standard [^112Ts1bx] [^114qQagg]. Salivary pepsin is a noninvasive adjunct with moderate sensitivity/specificity [^114QT8rv] [^116jJv4D]; **multiple daily samples improve accuracy** [^115faDvu] [^115bXjbS]. Oropharyngeal pH monitoring (Dx-pH) is limited by poor correlation with esophageal reflux and is not recommended as a standalone test [^115AncAq] [^114WqV4S]. Routine labs (CBC, CMP, TSH) are not diagnostic for LPR but help exclude other causes; use HEMII-pH to confirm LPR before long-term PPIs or surgery [^114qQagg] [^117WUyif] [^1139uEGz].

## Objective diagnostic tests for LPR

Key characteristics of objective diagnostic tests for LPR:

| **Aspect** | **24-hour hypopharyngeal-esophageal multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH (HEMII-pH) monitoring** | **Salivary pepsin assay** | **Oropharyngeal pH monitoring (Dx-pH)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Description | Detects acid, weakly acidic, and non-acidic reflux events reaching the hypopharynx; current gold standard for LPR diagnosis [^113k2d9o] [^112Ts1bx] | Noninvasive immunoassay detecting pepsin in saliva, a marker of gastric refluxate reaching the oropharynx [^113wSEtw] [^116jJv4D] | Measures oropharyngeal acid exposure using a nasopharyngeal probe; Ryan score > 9.4 (upright) or > 6.8 (supine) is considered positive [^115ZRcY2] |
| Diagnostic criteria/performance | At least one hypopharyngeal reflux episode during 24 hours is considered clinically significant [^114qQagg] | Sensitivity ~86%, specificity ~68% [^114QT8rv]; multiple daily samples improve accuracy [^115faDvu] [^111kh4RP] | Poor correlation with esophageal reflux monitoring; limited specificity and sensitivity [^115AncAq] [^113Gs8kp] |
| Advantages | High sensitivity and specificity; detects both acid and non-acid reflux; provides detailed reflux-symptom correlation [^113hSmH9] | Noninvasive, cost-effective, and suitable for repeated sampling [^116jJv4D] | Minimally invasive and provides direct oropharyngeal acid exposure data [^115ZRcY2] |
| Limitations | Invasive, patient discomfort, limited availability, and high cost [^114qQagg] | No standardized cutoff values; results influenced by diet, smoking, and sampling time [^114QT8rv] [^115ZRcY2] | Controversial diagnostic criteria; frequent false positives; not recommended as a standalone test [^1167yDCQ] [^114WqV4S] |

## Subjective diagnostic tools

### Reflux symptom index (RSI)

The RSI is a nine-item patient-reported scale (score 0–45); a score > 13 suggests LPR [^111kh4RP]. It is **easy to administer and widely used**, but has limited specificity and correlates poorly with objective reflux metrics [^116WniBQ].

---

### Reflux Finding Score (RFS)

The RFS is an eight-item laryngoscopic scoring system (score 0–26); a score > 7 suggests LPR [^114dw4Um]. It provides direct visualization of laryngeal changes, but findings are **nonspecific** and inter-rater variability is high [^11194HGt].

---

## Routine laboratory tests

Routine laboratory tests (CBC, CMP, TSH) are **not diagnostic for LPR** but help exclude other conditions that mimic LPR symptoms (e.g. anemia, thyroid dysfunction, renal/hepatic disease).

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

| **Step** | **Test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Clinical assessment (RSI, RFS) | Initial screening for LPR symptoms and signs [^111kh4RP] |
| 2 | HEMII-pH monitoring | Gold standard for objective LPR diagnosis [^112Ts1bx] [^112w2oXk] |
| 3 | Salivary pepsin assay | Noninvasive adjunctive test; multiple samples recommended [^1145Aste] [^115faDvu] |
| 4 | Routine laboratory tests (CBC, CMP, TSH) | Exclude other causes of symptoms [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

ACG 2022 guidelines recommend **objective reflux testing** (preferably HEMII-pH) for patients with extraesophageal symptoms without typical GERD symptoms, and advise against diagnosing LPR based on laryngoscopy alone [^1139uEGz] [^115r3u6h]. The Lyon Consensus 2.0 similarly emphasizes objective testing to confirm reflux-related pathology before invasive therapy [^113hSmH9] [^111ssd36].

---

## Limitations and controversies

- **Lack of gold standard**: No single test definitively diagnoses LPR; HEMII-pH is the closest available standard [^114WqV4S] [^112Ts1bx].
- **Variability in diagnostic criteria**: Different studies use varying thresholds and criteria, complicating diagnosis and management [^112Ts1bx].
- **Poor correlation**: Subjective tools (RSI, RFS) correlate poorly with objective reflux metrics [^11194HGt] [^116WniBQ].
- **Invasiveness and cost**: Objective tests like HEMII-pH are invasive, costly, and not widely available [^112grCzT].

---

## Conclusion

HEMII-pH monitoring is the **gold standard** for diagnosing LPR, whereas salivary pepsin is a useful, noninvasive adjunct when multiple samples are used [^112Ts1bx] [^115faDvu]. Oropharyngeal pH monitoring has limited reliability and is not recommended as a standalone test [^115AncAq]. Routine labs help exclude other causes but do not diagnose LPR; objective testing should guide management to avoid unnecessary PPI use or surgery [^1139uEGz] [^113uy53E].

INTRODUCTION

Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) results in 10% of otolaryngology consultations. 1, 2 The clinical challenge is to determine if primarily present symptoms such as hoarseness, frequent throat clearing, cough, or asthma‐like symptoms are related to an exacerbated gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or are caused by other potential etiologies such as allergies, sinusitis, chronic bronchitis, or a postnasal drip syndrom. 3 The main problems are that the current standard methods are not sufficient and accurate enough to definitively diagnose LPR. 4, 5 The lack of LPR‐specific tests often leads to evaluation of an empirical treatment response to GERD or multichannel intraluminal impedance pH throughout 24‐h monitoring (MII‐pH), which is still the gold standard measurement tool to assess if present extraesophageal symptoms are caused by GERD. 5 However, MII‐pH is an invasive and costly method and cannot be performed on all patients with suspicion to suffer from LPR. 6, 7 There is a need for noninvasive and inexpensive methods that allow for a more sensitive and accurate diagnosis of LPR to optimize the treatment strategies for this patient cohort.

Recently, a few studies reported that oropharyngeal pH monitoring using the Restech measurement system (Dx‐pH) appears to be more sensitive than MII‐pH in the evaluation of patients with LPR, although the authors state that Dx‐pH is still limited due to a lack of consensus on normal and abnormal cutoff values, as well as missing well‐controlled prospective studies. 8, 9

Controversial data is provided by Willhelm et al. who reported that 60% of asymptomatic gastrectomy patients showed positive results in Dx‐pH. Therefore, the authors state that Dx‐pH is not useful to guide any diagnostic or therapeutic decisions. 10

As another diagnostic method, pepsin determination in saliva has been proposed as a tool to improve the diagnosis of GERD as well as LPR.

Pepsin is a proteolytic enzyme, which is activated by its precursor pepsinogen in the stomach and can be detected in saliva as well as secretion samples from the lung, sinus, middle ear, trachea, and exhaled breath condensate. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15

### Laryngitis and gastroesophageal reflux disease: increasing prevalence or poor diagnostic tests? [^112gLntp]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Laryngeal signs and symptoms are often associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, such diagnoses presume that laryngeal findings may be specific for GERD. However, neither laryngoscopy, EGD or pH monitoring are specific tests for identifying GERD related laryngitis. Non-placebo controlled trials often show clinical benefit from proton pump inhibitor therapy; however, suffer from lack of controls. GERD may be one cause of laryngeal signs and symptoms in a subgroup of patients but not in all those currently so suspected. Future, studies are needed in this area to better delineate this association.

### Update on laryngopharyngeal reflux disease [^111VpmpA]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic laryngopharyngeal symptoms (LPS) are increasingly prevalent presentations to gastroenterologists' offices, and clinicians often make a presumptive diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux disease (LPRD) based on LPS symptoms or laryngoscopic findings alone. Such presumptive diagnoses of LPRD often are incorrect, and establishing the correct diagnosis poses significant challenges for clinicians. This review addresses the timely need for advances in evaluating and managing LPS/LPRD, given their diagnostic complexity and the healthcare burden of ineffective empiric treatments.

Recent Findings

Recent evidence emphasizes the diverse etiologies of LPS including LPRD, oropharyngeal or other airway pathologies, allergic conditions, and cognitive-affective processes or altered brain-larynx interaction. The diagnostic approach should be individualized and multimodal, including upfront reflux testing over empiric acid suppression trials for possible LPRD, given the poor correlation between LPS and objective evidence of reflux. Predictive models and risk stratification tools such as the COuGH RefluX score show promise to help guide testing and therapeutic strategies. Reflux testing modalities include wireless pH monitoring and impedance-based testing (traditional impedance-pH or combined hypopharyngeal-esophageal reflux monitoring). Biochemical testing for salivary pepsin may also offer adjunctive value. Management should include antireflux strategies for those with objectively-proven LPRD, alongside treatments targeting nonreflux mechanisms of LPS, such as voice therapy, neuromodulation, and behavioral therapy.

Summary

An individualized, multidisciplinary approach is essential in managing LPS/LPRD. Objective reflux testing improves diagnostic accuracy, avoids unnecessary therapies, and enables tailored treatment. Future research should further refine diagnostic thresholds, validate risk stratification tools, and explore novel therapeutic targets to optimize outcomes.

### The value of routine pH monitoring in the diagnosis and treatment of laryngopharyngeal reflux [^116WniBQ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the need for pH testing in diagnosing laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR).

Study Design

Case series with planned data collection.

Setting

Tertiary care center.

Subjects and Methods

On the basis of symptoms and/or abnormal endoscopic findings, more than 500 patients underwent 24-hour pharyngeal pH testing at a single center (using the Dx-pH probe) between January 2009 and June 2011. A total of 163 patients not on proton-pump inhibitors at the time of study and with complete data available for analysis (pH results, body mass index, smoking status, pretest reflux symptom index) were divided into 2 groups by positive (n = 70) and negative (n = 93) Ryan Score. The Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) was compared between groups and assessed overall against Ryan Score parameters at different pH thresholds. The diagnostic utility of an RSI ≥ 13 for prediction of Ryan Score was assessed.

Results

No significant difference in RSI was seen between Ryan-positive (17.50 ± 11.47) and Ryan-negative (14.95 ± 11.43) patients (P = 0.161). Overall, RSI correlated poorly with percentage time spent below pH thresholds 6.5, 6.0, 5.5, and 5.0 and upright and supine Ryan parameters at these thresholds (as determined by linear regression analysis). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of RSI ≥ 13 for Ryan positivity were 55.7%, 47.3%, 44.3%, and 58.7%, respectively.

Conclusion

Our findings show that in our population of otolaryngology patients, the diagnosis of LPR cannot be reliably made on the basis of symptoms alone. Diagnosis, and in particular treatment decisions, should ideally be made on the basis of a combination of symptoms, signs, and confirmatory testing.

### Therapeutic strategies for laryngeal manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^115Y9iuY]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease is increasingly associated with ear, nose, and throat symptoms, including laryngitis. Many patients are unaware of the gastroesophageal etiology of their symptoms. A variety of criteria are used to diagnose this condition, including laryngoscopy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and the use of ambulatory pH and impedance monitoring. However, no test serves as the gold standard for the diagnosis given their lack of sensitivity and specificity for reflux disease. Numerous trials have assessed the role of proton pump inhibitor therapy in patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux and most have revealed no benefit to acid suppression over placebo. Despite many uncertainties there has been some progress regarding the role of acid-suppressive therapy as well as other agents in this unique group of patients. In this review we explore therapeutic options and their rationale for patients with laryngeal signs and symptoms.

### The reflux symptom score has good screening value for laryngopharyngeal reflux [^111kh4RP]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Common diagnostic and screening methods in clinical practice include 24-hour multichannel impedance pH monitoring (24 h MII-pH), empiric antireflux therapy, salivary pepsin testing, and signs and symptoms scale. 24 h MII-pH monitoring is considered by most specialists as the gold standard for the diagnosis of LPR as it can record the reflux events experienced in real-time, and doctors can analyze them using specific software after the patient's monitoring is completed. However, 24 h MII-pH monitoring is an invasive and expensive test, and only a few large tertiary hospitals in China offer this test, making it difficult to apply 24 h MII-pH monitoring in clinical screening for such a large LPR population. Salivary pepsin assay is an emerging diagnostic method for LPR because it is noninvasive, rapid, and affordable. However, the level of pepsin in saliva is susceptible to feeding as well as other factors, and there is still no consensus on its optimal time to collect saliva samples. A study has reported that collecting a saliva sample for testing in the morning is the optimal time, but other studies have found that performing only a single test can have a high rate of missed diagnoses and advocate multiple tests throughout the day to improve diagnostic sensitivity. The reflux symptom index (RSI) is currently the most widely used screening method for LPR, where patients are scored only on the severity of their reflux-related symptoms, and are considered to suspected LPR if their RSI > 13. In recent years, a new reflux symptom score (RSS) has been reported and validated in different regions, and in contrast to the RSI, the RSS incorporates more symptoms associated with LPR (e.g. ear pressure/pain, tongue burning, and abdominal distension/flatus). In addition, the RSS employs a scoring method distinct from that of the RSI, taking into account not only the severity of reflux symptoms, but also the frequency of occurrence and the impact on quality of life. A study showed better diagnostic LPR concordance between the RSS and 24 h MII-pH monitoring compared to the RSI. However, the RSS is a newly developed scale and its application in clinical practice still requires further exploration and validation. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies investigating the concordance between the RSS and the multitemporal salivary pepsin assay.

Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) practice patterns — a 2002 position statement stated that the diagnosis of laryngopharyngealreflux (LPR) can be made on the basis of patient symptoms, laryngeal findings, and/or pH probe results and recommended treatment with twice-daily proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for a minimum initial period of 6 months, and aggressive pursuit of gastroesophageal reflux of these symptoms continues despite more recent data challenging the accuracy of laryngeal findings, empiric trials of PPIs, and pH monitoring to establish causation.

### Reducing the duration of 24-hour multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH monitoring for laryngopharyngeal reflux [^114qQagg]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A diagnosis of LPR may be established based on asking patients about specific symptoms, laryngoscopy, or 24‐hour double probe pH monitoring. However, LPR diagnosis may be difficult because its symptoms are nonspecific and the laryngeal findings do not always correlate with symptom severity. The non‐specificity of symptoms and laryngeal findings attributed to LPR and the poor effectiveness of empiric proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy make the diagnosis challenging, resulting in overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis of the condition.24‐Hour HEMII‐pH monitoring is the most reliable method for detecting reflux characteristics and diagnosing LPR. The presence of at least one hypopharyngeal reflux episode on 24‐hour HEMII‐pH monitoring is considered clinically significant. This method allows detection of both acid and nonacid reflux events reaching the hypopharynx, providing a more reliable basis for diagnosis in patients with ambiguous symptoms. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), on the other hand, is typically diagnosed by assessing acid exposure in the distal esophagus using conventional 24‐hour pH monitoring. Since LPR often involves more proximal and nonacidic reflux, GERD diagnostic criteria may fail to detect LPR. This highlights the importance of using HEMII‐pH monitoring for accurate evaluation and facilitates the development of individualized treatment strategies.

Empirical PPI treatment without an objective diagnosis based on 24‐hour HEMII‐pH monitoring in patients with suspected LPR can lead to prolonged treatment, high cost, and refractory progression despite long‐term treatment. However, many otolaryngologists are reluctant to use HEMII‐pH monitoring due to patient inconvenience, poor patient tolerance, unclear indications, and a perceived lack of benefit for LPR management. Our previous research focused on evaluating whether 24‐hour MII‐pH monitoring is perceived as uncomfortable or invasive. Although most patients did not regret undergoing 24‐hour MII‐pH monitoring and acknowledged its diagnostic necessity after treatment, our previous research showed that the test was poorly tolerated due to significant discomfort during the monitoring period. These challenges highlight the need for more efficient alternatives that reduce discomfort while maintaining diagnostic reliability.

### Diagnostic testing for laryngopharyngeal reflux disease: the role of 24-hour hypopharyngeal-esophageal multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH monitoring [^112Ts1bx]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Laryngopharyngeal reflux disease (LPRD) presents as a constellation of nonspecific upper aerodigestive tract symptoms and signs. Among many objective tools available on the market, hypopharyngeal-esophageal multichannel intraluminal impedance and pH monitoring (HEMII-pH) is considered to date the gold standard technique for diagnosing LPRD, as well as tailoring treatment according to the different LPR profiles. More studies are needed to further validate and standardize diagnostic criteria and evaluate long-term outcomes of patients diagnosed and treated for LPRD using HEMII-pH.

### Extraesophageal symptoms and diseases attributed to GERD: where is the pendulum swinging now? [^113wybgK]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic tests for extraesophageal reflux — there are no established diagnostic tests that unequivocally link any suspected extraesophageal symptom to GERD. Tests commonly used include laryngoscopy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, ambulatory pH monitoring, combined pH-impedance ambulatory monitoring, and novel tests such as salivary pepsin and mucosal impedance, but they suffer from either lack of sensitivity or specificity and have limited associated treatment outcomes.

### Pepsin and oropharyngeal pH monitoring to diagnose patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux [^1145Aste]. The Laryngoscope (2020). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The results of this study show that salivary pepsin could be an alternative, cost‐effective, noninvasive measurement tool to assist office‐based diagnosis of LPR, whereas Dx‐pH appears not to be an adequate test. However, larger controlled trials are required to reach more definite conclusions.

### Assessing old and new diagnostic tests for gastroesophageal reflux disease [^113Xnyai]. Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

A detailed critique of objective measurements of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) would improve management of patients suspecting of having reflux, leading to rational selection of treatment and better outcomes. Many diagnostic tests for GERD have been developed over the past decades. We analyze their development, positive- and negative-predictive values, and ability to predict response to treatment. These features are important for development of medical, surgical, and endoscopic therapies for GERD. We discuss the value of available diagnostic tests and review their role in management of patients with persistent reflux symptoms despite adequate medical or surgical treatment. This is becoming a significant health economic problem, due to the widespread use of proton pump inhibitors. GERD is believed to cause nonesophageal symptoms, such as those provoked by ear, nose, throat, or respiratory disorders. We analyze the value of GERD diagnostic tests in evaluation of these troublesome, nonesophageal symptoms.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^113uy53E]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Extraesophageal GERD symptoms — key concepts and testing steps highlight limits of diagnostics and preferred sequencing. "Although GERD may be a contributor to extraesophageal symptoms in some patients, careful evaluation for other causes should be considered for patients with laryngeal symptoms, chronic cough, and asthma". "Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of potential extraesophageal symptoms of GERD is limited by lack of a gold-standard test, variable symptoms, and other disorders which may cause similar symptoms". Noninvasive biomarkers lack utility: "salivary pepsin testing is not recommended for evaluation of patients with extraesophageal reflux symptoms". After failed empiric therapy, escalation is specified: "For patients whose extraesophageal symptoms have not responded to a trial of twice-daily PPIs, we recommend upper endoscopy, ideally off PPIs for 2–4 weeks. If endoscopy is normal, consider reflux monitoring". Routine proximal pH testing is discouraged: "For patients with extraesophageal symptoms, we do not routinely recommend oropharyngeal or pharyngeal pH monitoring".

Discussion

The incidence of LPR in otolaryngology head and neck surgery patients is increasing year by year, however, there is still no consensus on the diagnosis of LPR. Most scholars now recognize 24 h MII-pH monitoring as the gold standard for the diagnosis of LPR. Nonetheless, 24 h MII-pH monitoring is considered an invasive procedure, with patients frequently reporting discomfort throughout the monitoring period. Moreover, the examination's high cost is also a barrier to its widespread application in clinical practice, as many patients decline the procedure due to financial considerations. The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical utility of screening tools for LPR. Consequently, the reference standard employed in this study is salivary pepsin testing rather than 24 h MII-pH monitoring. This choice is based on the fact that salivary pepsin testing serves as a more feasible screening instrument in clinical practice, offering the potential for application in large-scale populations. In this study, we first investigated the consistency between the two methods in the screening of LPR and the screening value of RSS for LPR. We found a good consistency between the two methods and that RSS showed good screening value for LPR.

The RSI has been widely used by otolaryngologists in the ensuing decade since it was first proposed by Belafsky et al. However, as clinicians gain a deeper understanding of LPR, it has become increasingly clear that the reflux symptoms in the RSI do not seem to perfectly cover all symptoms associated with LPR, and that the way the RSI is scored only incorporates the severity of the reflux symptoms, ignoring the frequency of occurrence of reflux and its impact on quality of life. Considering these issues, a new RSS has been reported, which covers a more comprehensive range of reflux-related symptoms and is scored in a more scientific manner, allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of the frequency, severity, and impact on quality of life of LPR-related symptoms. The RSS was first validated in France and Belgium, and subsequently, the RSS was validated in different countries. Min et al. translated RSS into Korean and validated it, and their results showed that RSS had good retest validity and internal and external validity. Han et al. translated RSS into Chinese, and they found that RSS had good internal and external reliabilities.

### ACG clinical guidelines: clinical use of esophageal physiologic testing [^11397rnd]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Extraesophageal reflux symptoms — diagnosis with ambulatory testing rather than laryngoscopy: Laryngoscopic findings of erythema, edema, and/or postcricoid hyperplasia have low specificity for GERD and are common in healthy volunteers, and in small prospective cohorts of patients with laryngeal symptoms and laryngoscopic signs of LPR, pH impedance testing off PPI therapy confirmed GERD in less than half of patients. We recommend ambulatory reflux monitoring, specifically pH impedance monitoring performed off acid suppression, over laryngoscopy for a diagnosis of extraesophageal reflux (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).

### Diagnosis and treatment of the extraesophageal manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^111Xvumb]. Annals of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment options available for management of extraesophageal manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and to compare the most recent technological advances to the existing guidelines.

Summary Background Data

Extraesophageal manifestations of GERD include cough, laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR), and asthma. Recent advances in diagnostic modalities may have outpaced the existing diagnostic and therapeutic clinical guidelines.

Methods

We searched the MEDLINE, Cochrane, and Embase databases for articles pertaining to the presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of extraesophageal manifestations of reflux, specifically cough due to reflux, LPR, and asthma due to reflux. Search terms applied to 3 thematic topics: diagnosis, medical treatment, and surgical treatment. We had searched the bibliographies of included studies, yielding a total of 271 articles for full review. We graded the level of evidence and classified recommendations by size of treatment effect, according to the guidelines from the American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines.

Results

One hundred twenty-eight articles met criteria for analysis. Our findings show that the diagnosis of cough, LPR, or asthma due to gastroesophageal reflux is difficult, as no criterion standard test exits. Also, patients often present without heartburn or regurgitation typical of GERD. Combined multichannel intraluminal impedance, the pH (MII-pH) monitoring system, and the symptom association probability (SAP) test might distinguish extraesophageal manifestations of reflux from idiopathic chronic cough, laryngitis due to other causes, and atopic asthma. In addition, extraesophageal manifestations of reflux are most effectively diagnosed with a stepwise approach incorporating empiric treatment and antisecretory therapy, combined MII-pH monitoring, and surgical intervention in few selected cases.

Conclusions

Recent studies demonstrate the potential diagnostic role of MII-pH monitoring. Surgical intervention provides resolution of extraesophageal symptoms less reliably than typical symptoms when the patient has GERD.

### Extraesophageal presentations of GERD: where is the science? [^112ZzBqJ]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

This article reviews the evaluation and management of patients with suspected extraesophageal manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease, such as asthma, chronic cough, and laryngitis, which are commonly encountered in gastroenterology practices. Otolaryngologists and gastroenterologists commonly disagree upon the underlying cause for complaints in patients with one of the suspected extraesophageal reflux syndromes. The accuracy of diagnostic tests (laryngoscopy, endoscopy, and pH- or pH-impedance monitoring) for patients with suspected extraesophageal manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease is suboptimal. An empiric trial of proton pump inhibitors in patients without alarm features can help some patients, but the response to therapy is variable.

### Laryngopharyngeal reflux and benign vocal fold lesions: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113pPexw]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

There is a link between laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) and the formation of benign vocal fold lesions (BVFLs). However, previous studies have mainly focused on LPR suggested by symptoms and signs, rather than objectively diagnosed LPR via pharyngeal pH monitoring. We, therefore, conducted a Meta-analysis to evaluate the association between pharyngeal pH monitoring diagnosed LPR and the odds of BVFLs.

Data Sources

Relevant observational studies were identified by searching PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science.

Review Methods

We evaluated between-study heterogeneity using the Cochrane Q test and estimated the I 2 statistic. Random-effects models were used when significant heterogeneity was observed; otherwise, fixed-effects models were used.

Results

Thirteen datasets from 9 studies were included. Among them, 493 were diagnosed with LPR and 344 had BVFLs. LPR was related to a higher odds of BVFLs (odds ratio: 3.26, 95% confidence interval: 1.84–5.76, P < .001) with moderate heterogeneity (P for Cochrane Q test = .006, I² = 57%). Subgroup analyses showed that the association was similar in studies with only pharyngeal pH monitoring (Restech), with double-probe or 3-site pH monitoring, and with 24-hour multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH monitoring (P for subgroup difference = .15). In addition, subgroup analysis showed consistent results in studies from Asia and Europe (P for subgroup analysis = .12), and the association seemed to be consistent for vocal Reinke's edema, nodules, and polyps (P for subgroup difference = .09).

Conclusion

Pharyngeal pH monitoring diagnosed LPR is associated with the formation of BVFLs.

### Reducing the duration of 24-hour multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH monitoring for laryngopharyngeal reflux [^112w2oXk]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) is defined as an inflammatory disease of the tissues in the upper aerodigestive tract caused by the direct or indirect action of gastroduodenal reflux‐related contents. This condition can lead to morphological changes and a variety of signs and symptoms in the upper aerodigestive tract.LPR has been associated with numerous laryngeal diseases, including reflux laryngitis, laryngeal granuloma, leukoplakia, laryngeal carcinoma, contact ulcers, vocal nodules, and subglottic stenosis. It has been reported that up to 10% of patients presenting to otolaryngology clinics have LPR, and more than 50% of patients with hoarseness have reflux‐related disease.

Although LPR is common, its diagnosis can be challenging due to nonspecific symptoms and the lack of correlation between laryngeal findings and symptom severity. Clinical tools for LPR evaluation, such as Reflux Finding Score (RFS) and Reflux Symptom Index (RSI), have demonstrated limited sensitivity and specificity. The development of LPR symptoms and signs is associated with hypopharyngeal‐esophageal reflux episodes, which are detected by hypopharyngeal‐esophageal multichannel intraluminal impedance‐pH (HEMII‐pH) monitoring. Although 24‐hour HEMII‐pH monitoring is considered the gold standard for diagnosing LPR, it remains little used by most otolaryngologists.

Our previous studies indicated that although the pain experienced during 24‐hour HEMII‐pH monitoring was comparable to that of other diagnostic tests, it was perceived as more uncomfortable and less tolerable. Despite these challenges, most patients who underwent the 24‐hour HEMII‐pH monitoring expressed satisfaction with their decision to proceed. This highlights the need to explore strategies aimed at reducing patient discomfort. The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of reducing the monitoring duration for 24‐hour HEMII‐pH monitoring, while maintaining its diagnostic sensitivity for hypopharyngeal reflux episodes.

### ACG clinical guidelines: clinical use of esophageal physiologic testing [^116jJv4D]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Salivary pepsin testing for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) shows mixed diagnostic performance and an uncertain clinical role. A study with GERD and 51 controls reported an 81% positive predictive value and 78% negative predictive value, and another study with 100 controls and 111 symptomatic heartburn patients found that salivary pepsin > 210 ng/mL was 98.2% specific for GERD and/or reflux hypersensitivity compared with pH impedance monitoring. Conversely, two studies found no significant difference between symptomatic GERD patients and asymptomatic volunteers and detected positive salivary pepsin results in most volunteers, and a meta-analysis of 11 observational studies of Peptest in LPR reported pooled sensitivity of 64% and specificity of 68%. The document notes concerns regarding diagnostic reliability and reproducibility of Peptest, yet describes salivary pepsin testing as noninvasive, rapid, and cost-efficient and states it continues to be studied as an alternative diagnostic screening tool for GERD and LPR.

### Diagnostic yield of ambulatory reflux monitoring systems for evaluation of chronic laryngeal symptoms [^1168iyJr]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Among patients with chronic laryngeal symptoms, ambulatory reflux monitoring off acid suppression is recommended to evaluate for laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). However, reflux monitoring systems are diverse in configuration and monitoring capabilities, which present a challenge in creating a diagnostic reference standard in these patients. This study aimed to compare diagnostic yield and performance between reflux monitoring systems in patients with chronic laryngeal symptoms.

Methods

This multicenter, international study of adult patients referred for evaluation of LPR over a 5-year period (March 2018-May 2023) assessed and compared diagnostic yield of pathologic gastroesophageal reflux (GER+) on ambulatory reflux monitoring off acid suppression.

Results

Of 813 patients, 296 (36%) underwent prolonged wireless pH, 532 (65%) underwent 24-hour pH-impedance monitoring, and 15 (2%) underwent both tests. Overall diagnostic yield for GER+ was 36% and greater for prolonged wireless pH compared with that for 24-hour pH-impedance monitoring (50% vs 27%; P < 0.01). Among 15 patients who underwent both prolonged wireless pH and 24-h pH-impedance monitoring, concordance between systems for GER+ was 40%. The most common source of discordance was strong evidence of GER+ across multiple days on prolonged wireless pH compared with no evidence of GER+ on pH-impedance.

Discussion

In this multicenter international study of patients with chronic laryngeal symptoms referred for LPR evaluation, diagnostic yield of ambulatory reflux monitoring off acid suppression was 36% and rose to 50% when using wireless pH monitoring. In patients referred for chronic laryngeal symptoms, 24-hour pH-impedance monitoring may risk a low negative predictive value in patients with unproven GER+ disease.

### Reducing the duration of 24-hour multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH monitoring for laryngopharyngeal reflux [^113k2d9o]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

Subjects and Study Design

We retrospectively reviewed patients diagnosed with LPR based on 24‐hour HEMII‐pH monitoring. At our institution, this test is selectively performed in patients with suspected LPR who are either treatment‐naïve or have persistent symptoms despite short‐term PPI therapy, with a minimum 2‐week washout period before testing. The diagnosis of LPR was defined as the presence of at least one hypopharyngeal reflux episode detected during 24‐hour HEMII‐pH monitoring. Hypopharyngeal reflux episodes were characterized by reflux reaching proximally to 1 cm above the upper esophageal sphincter and were classified as acid, weakly acidic, or weakly alkaline. During the chart review, data on patient demographics, including sex, age, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, alcohol consumption, and the starting time of the 24‐hour HEMII‐pH monitoring, were collected. Patients were included if they had at least one hypopharyngeal reflux episode detected during the 24‐hour HEMII‐pH monitoring. Exclusion criteria included insufficient medical records, incomplete or failed 24‐hour HEMII‐pH monitoring procedures, or the absence of hypopharyngeal reflux episodes. A total of 140 patients who met the inclusion criteria were identified. The occurrence and timing of hypopharyngeal reflux episodes were analyzed across the full 24‐hour monitoring period. This study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Kyung Hee University Medical Center.

Data Analysis

The data analysis was performed using two approaches to evaluate the diagnostic sensitivity of LPR based on monitoring duration. In the first analysis, we sought to determine how much the sensitivity of the test changed as we reduced the time instead of 24‐hour monitoring. We analyzed the sensitivity of the test by monitoring duration. For each time segment, we determined how many patients were diagnosed with LPR, defined as the presence of at least one hypopharyngeal reflux episode within the specified time period. Sensitivity values were then plotted as a function of monitoring duration. The second analysis was to determine which time of day would be most efficient for diagnosis to reduce the actual monitoring duration, so we analyzed the sensitivity of the diagnosis by time of day. Additionally, cumulative durations starting at specific times were analyzed to assess the effect of decreasing monitoring duration on diagnostic sensitivity.

### Detecting laryngopharyngeal reflux in patients with upper airways symptoms: symptoms, signs or salivary pepsin? [^113gdwTH]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) can induce laryngeal hyper-responsiveness, a unifying feature underlying chronic cough and vocal cord dysfunction. The diagnosis of LPR currently relies on invasive oesophageal pH impedance testing. We compared symptoms, laryngeal signs and salivary pepsin as potential diagnostic methods for identifying LPR in patients with upper airway symptoms.

Methods

Symptoms were assessed using the Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) and signs of laryngeal inflammation quantified using the Reflux Finding Score (RFS) during laryngoscopy. Saliva samples were analysed for the presence of pepsin. A sub-group of patients with severe symptoms and signs of LPR were investigated with oesophageal pH monitoring and impedance study.

Results

Seventy eight patients with chronic cough and/or suspected vocal cord dysfunction were recruited, mean (SD) age, 54.6 (15.6) years. The majority (87%) had significant symptoms of reflux (RSI > 13). There were clinical signs of LPR (RFS > 7) in 51% of cases. Pepsin was detected in the saliva of 63% of subjects and 78% of those with a high RFS. Salivary pepsin had a sensitivity of 78% and specificity of 53% for predicting a high RFS. There was a correlation between the RSI and RFS (r = 0.51, p < 0.001) and between the severity of laryngeal inflammation and the concentration of pepsin (r = 0.28, p = 0.01). All cases investigated with pH-impedance study had objective evidence of proximal reflux.

Conclusion

Salivary pepsin may be used as a screening adjunct to supplement the RFS in the clinical workup of patients with extra-oesophageal symptoms and upper respiratory tract presentations of reflux.

### Abnormal endoscopic pharyngeal and laryngeal findings attributable to reflux [^113jj8Aa]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The symptom complex associated with acid-induced injury to the larynx is referred to as laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). Basing the diagnosis of LPR on patient symptoms or 24-hour dual-probe pH data may be inaccurate, as these diagnostic tests are restricted by limitations in both sensitivity and specificity. The clinician must have a thorough understanding of endoscopic findings associated with this disorder. The severity of laryngeal inflammation caused by acid and activated pepsin can be quantified. This article reviews the abnormal endoscopic pharyngeal and laryngeal findings that are attributable to reflux.

Other testing modalities — oropharyngeal pH monitoring and salivary pepsin assays: Measurement of acid or reflux contents in the oropharynx via oropharyngeal pH monitoring or salivary pepsin assays represents conceptually appealing approaches that demonstrate potential utility to diagnose GERD, including among patients with extraesophageal symptoms; however, studies show poor concordance with esophageal reflux monitoring and overlap between healthy controls and symptomatic patients, limiting enthusiasm for these technologies in clinical practice.

### Are multiple tests necessary for salivary pepsin detection in the diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux? [^115faDvu]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the necessity of multiple salivary pepsin tests within a day when diagnosing laryngopharyngeal reflux.

Study Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

Tertiary hospitals.

Methods

A total of 138 patients with signs and/or symptoms associated with laryngopharyngeal reflux were included. Salivary pepsin was detected on the day of 24-hour pH monitoring, and the results of salivary pepsin detected once in the morning and multiple times in 1 day were compared with the results of pH monitoring.

Results

Among the 138 patients, pH monitoring results were positive in 112. Salivary pepsin was positive in 47 cases in the morning, which was not consistent with the results of pH monitoring (kappa value = 0.117). With the pH monitoring results as the standard, the salivary pepsin detected once in the morning had a sensitivity of 38.4% (43/112) and a specificity of 84.6% (22/26) for the diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux. When salivary pepsin was detected multiple times per day, 102 patients tested positive. The consistency with pH monitoring was moderate (kappa value = 0.587). The sensitivity was 86.6% (97/112), and the specificity was 80.8% (21/26). Of the 97 patients with positive results from pH monitoring and salivary pepsin detected multiple times a day, 54 had negative findings for a single detection in the morning, indicating that 55.7% (54/97) of the true positive cases were missed.

Conclusion

Although a single detection of salivary pepsin in the morning is more economical, the sensitivity is too low, and it is necessary to detect it multiple times a day.

### Pepsin and oropharyngeal pH monitoring to diagnose patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux [^111AY4sb]. The Laryngoscope (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of salivary pepsin with oropharyngeal pH monitoring using the Restech measurement system (Dx‐pH) for the diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR).

Study Design

Prospective cohort study.

Methods

Seventy patients with primary symptoms related to LPR underwent gastroscopy, high‐resolution manometry, pH throughout 24‐hour monitoring (MII‐pH), and barium esophagography between October 2015 and May 2018. In addition, an ear, nose, and throat examination was performed, including assessment of Belafsky Reflux Finding Score (RFS). Clinical symptoms were evaluated with the Belafsky Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) and the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI). Simultaneous to MII‐pH, pepsin determination and Dx‐pH were performed.

Results

Of 70 patients, 41 (58.6%) subjects with a pathological DeMeester score showed higher mean values of pepsin (mean value: 216 ng/mL, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 172 to 260), compared to patients with a normal DeMeester score (mean value: 161 ng/mL, 95% CI: 115 to 207). Salivary pepsin showed a specificity of 86.2% and sensitivity of 41.5% for diagnosing LPR using the optimal cutoff value of 216 ng/mL. Furthermore, a significant correlation between the values of salivary pepsin and the RSI score was seen in patients with pathological results in MII‐pH (r = 0.344; P = 0.046).

However, elevated Dx‐pH measurements showed no significant correlation with either MII‐pH, RSI score, RFS score, or GIQLI score, or with the results of pepsin measurement.

Conclusion

Pepsin measurement in saliva could be an alternative tool to assist office‐based diagnosis of LPR, whereas Dx‐pH does not seem to be an adequate test.

### Diagnosis and treatment of laryngopharyngeal reflux: use of empirical lansoprazole [^117MXo5W]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of empirical medical treatment in patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) disease by scoring the findings and symptoms. Hence, 122 patients were examined at the voice laboratory with a laryngovideostroboscopic device, and all results were recorded for further evaluation. Patients were treated with lansoprazole twice a day. All patients were evaluated before and during the treatment period at the first and third months. The reflux symptom index (RSI) and reflux finding score (RFS) records were correlated and statistically tested to confirm a diagnosis of LPR. The results revealed a significant improvement in the findings and symptoms due to this treatment modality and showed that RFS and RSI were correlated with LPR disease, which can help confirm its diagnosis. Findings and symptom scores before and after the treatment were compared. The differences were statistically significant, which strengthens the reliability of the score indices that were used. This study shows that RFS, RSI, and empirical treatment may be a useful, practical method of diagnosing and following up on LPR. We concluded that it is more efficient to score symptoms and findings together, instead of monitoring pH for 24 hours, in patients with potential LPR.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^111gNR7w]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Extraesophageal GERD evaluation — laryngoscopy limitations and reflux testing: Laryngoscopic assessments have limited diagnostic utility, with 29 different LPR signs and multiple scoring systems evaluated, low specificity, and low inter-rater reliability. In asymptomatic volunteers, abnormalities are frequent: in 1 study of 105 normal volunteers, 86% had reflux-associated laryngoscopic findings and some signs of LPR were seen in 70% of participants; a second study found at least 1 sign of inflammation in 93% on flexible laryngoscopy. For testing, multichannel pH-impedance, traditional catheter-based pH testing, and wireless pH testing have been used for extraesophageal symptoms, and pH-impedance can detect acid (pH < 4), weakly acidic (pH 4–7), and nonacidic (pH > 7) reflux. In patients with LPR symptoms, pH-impedance testing is abnormal in 40% of cases, and those with abnormal pH-impedance results were more likely to respond to PPI treatment than patients with normal testing.

### ACG clinical guidelines: clinical use of esophageal physiologic testing [^117WUyif]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Extraesophageal reflux symptoms without typical reflux — up-front testing vs empiric proton pump inhibitor (PPI) trial: A cost minimization study estimated an average weighted cost of $1,897 for up-front testing and $3,033 for empiric trial testing, empiric PPI therapy for suspected laryngopharyngeal reflux reported a 92.5% sensitivity and 14% specificity, and in a retrospective cohort study of 237 patients with extraesophageal symptoms not responsive to PPI therapy, AET on reflux monitoring predicted response to fundoplication. We recommend up-front ambulatory reflux monitoring off acid suppression over an empiric trial of PPI therapy for extraesophageal reflux symptoms without concurrent typical reflux symptoms (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

### Pepsin and oropharyngeal pH monitoring to diagnose patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux [^115vnmWT]. The Laryngoscope (2020). Medium credibility.

All in all, the results of our study underline the role of pepsin in the pathophysiology of laryngopharyngeal/extraesophageal reflux symptoms and encourage performing further research.

Nevertheless, correlation analysis between results of Dx‐pH and measurements of objective parameters such as MII‐pH, pepsin in saliva, and RFS score, as well as subjective parameters such as RSI and GIQLI, was not conclusive in our patient cohort.

These findings underline the results of previous published trials 10, 30, 31, 32; therefore, Dx‐pH may have no value in the diagnosis of patients with LPR.

Limitations of our study are the lack of follow‐up data to assess treatment outcomes after diagnostic decision based on salivary pepsin testing and that standardization of meals was not included. The patients were only asked to have three main meals so we could best simulate the patient's real life.

Catheter-based pH monitoring — limitations for laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) and reflux-related asthma and chronic cough: Catheter-based pH monitoring places a distal esophageal probe to assess acid reflux and symptom timing, but many laryngeal symptoms lack sudden onset making reliable symptom association difficult, and up to 90% of cough events are not reported with event markers; conventional distal 24-hour esophageal pH-monitoring cannot be considered as reliable for diagnosing LPR and reflux-related asthma, and abnormal distal esophageal exposure does not predict proton pump inhibitor response despite being present in 30%–50% of suspected LPR/asthma cases; in chronic cough, abnormal esophageal acid exposure during 24-hour pH monitoring may help to identify a subgroup more likely to have reflux-related chronic cough.

### Evaluation of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^111cj12s]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may present with heartburn, regurgitation, dysphagia, chronic cough, laryngitis, or even asthma. The clinical presentation of GERD is therefore varied and poses certain challenges to the physician, especially given the limitations of the diagnostic testing.

Discussion

The evaluation of patients with suspected GERD might be challenging. It is based on the evaluation of clinical features, objective evidence of reflux on diagnostic testing, correlation of symptoms with episodes of reflux, evaluation of anatomical abnormalities, and excluding other causes that might account for the presence of the patient's symptoms.

Conclusions

The diagnostic evaluation should include multiple tests, in addition to a thorough clinical examination.

### Optimal timing of saliva collection to detect pepsin in patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux [^115bXjbS]. The Laryngoscope (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

To determine salivary pepsin levels as a function of collection time.

Study Design

A prospective, case-control study.

Methods

We selected 57 patients with clinical symptoms and signs of laryngopharyngeal reflux who underwent 24-hour multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH (24h MII-pH) monitoring tests, and 12 control subjects without clinical symptoms and signs of laryngopharyngeal reflux. All subjects were instructed to collect saliva samples upon waking, 1 hour after each meal (3 times per day), and upon any occurrence of laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) symptoms. The pepsin levels in saliva were measured by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The Reflux Symptom Index survey was also administered.

Results

A total of 50 patients in whom LPR was diagnosed based on results of 24h MII-pH monitoring test were enrolled in the study. The average pepsin level upon waking was 17.2 ng/mL, which was significantly higher than that measured in samples collected at any other time (P < .005). Pepsin levels were higher in patients with LPR than those in controls. The Reflux Symptom Index scores were statistically different between these groups of subjects.

Conclusions

The levels of total pepsin in saliva collected upon waking were significantly higher in the group of patients presenting with LPR symptoms and who demonstrated at least one episode of proximal esophageal reflux during 24h MII-pH monitoring. Furthermore, the average pepsin level upon waking was higher than that measured at any other time. Measuring pepsin levels in the saliva upon waking may be a useful method in the diagnosis of LPR.

### Esophageal pH monitoring, indications, and methods [^1113ieCU]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common problem that affects a substantial proportion of the American population. It is estimated that the symptoms of GERD may afflict 40% to 45% of Americans each month. The diagnosis of GERD can be difficult, as its symptoms vary from typical symptoms like heartburn to atypical symptoms such as hoarseness, coughing, and chest pain. Most patients present with typical symptoms and are diagnosed with GERD if they respond to empiric trials of acid suppression. Many tests are available to help with diagnosing GERD in patients who either present with atypical symptoms or who do not respond to acid suppression; however, each test has its own shortcomings. The only test that directly measures whether acid is refluxing into the esophagus is the pH probe, but this test is uncomfortable for the patient, can be difficult to interpret, and may not be necessary in all cases. This article reviews the indications for pH monitoring, its technique, its advantages and limitations, and its role the diagnosis of GERD.

Diagnostic and clinical classifications of UCTS

Several aetiological theories have emerged over decades of scientific enquiry to account for UCTS and inform divergent diagnoses and treatment approaches employed for these complaints. These may be broadly divided into chronic inflammatory and functional symptom concepts, the prominent theories and diagnoses of which are summarised below.

Chronic inflammatory concepts

Occult irritation of the aerodigestive tract causing chronic inflammation of the larynx or laryngopharynx is promoted as a cause of non-specific UCTS. Potential contributors include refluxed gastroduodenal content, inhaled irritants, respiratory allergens and voice behaviours. However, inflammatory indicators from nasoendoscopyare non-specific to both symptoms and postulated inflammatory aetiology in most literature investigating this relationship, are often identified in asymptomatic individualsand are subject to variable interpretations, highlighting diagnostic complexities.

Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease

Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) is theorised to result from the back flow of gastroduodenal contents into the laryngopharynx, leading to chronic inflammation. Central to its pathophysiology is the inflammatory reaction to these contents, with pepsin being a primary culprit. Although gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is more prevalent among those with chronic throat issues, attributing aerodigestive symptoms to LPR is contentious. Unlike GORD, reflux-associated throat symptoms are non-specific, often seen in upright individuals during the day, regardless of BMI, and typically without heartburn.

Diagnostic approach

Diagnosing LPR is complex. Nasoendoscopic findings reflect secondary mucosal inflammation and are open to interpretation. The gold standard for GORD diagnosis, intraluminal oesophageal pH-impedance (pH-II), has poor sensitivity and specificity for LPR, offering little therapeutic guidance. The search for a definitive diagnostic tool for LPR continues, making the current diagnosis largely clinical.

Treatment approach

Treatment often mirrors those used in treatment of GORD, emphasising lifestyle changes although their effectiveness has yet to be validated. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were once the go-to for LPR, but recent studies question their efficacy for reflux-induced laryngeal symptoms, possibly due to the role of pepsin. Liquid alginates consumed after meals may have modest benefits based on early research. Anti-reflux surgery appears to be more effective than acid suppression therapies, but its symptomatic relief does not always correlate with acid and impedance metrics, leading to varied interpretations in the literature and challenges in patient selection.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^112NP6wx]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for gastroesophageal reflux disease, more specifically with respect to ambulatory esophageal reflux monitoring, ACG 2022 guidelines recommend to obtain reflux monitoring off therapy to establish the diagnosis in patients with suspected but not clear GERD, if endoscopy shows no objective evidence of GERD.

### Diagnostic accuracy of patient-reported outcome measures and finding instruments in laryngopharyngeal reflux disease [^111Sk6Pp]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the diagnostic accuracy of various combinations of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and upper aerodigestive tract finding instruments dedicated to the clinical diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux disease (LPRD).

Study Design

Prospective, multicenter study.

Setting

University hospital.

Methods

Patients with LPRD at the 24-hour hypopharyngeal-esophageal multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH monitoring were recruited from three European hospitals. Asymptomatic individuals served as the control group. Participants completed the Reflux Symptom Index (RSI), Reflux Symptom Score (RSS), and Reflux Symptom Score-12 (RSS-12) at baseline and 3-month posttreatment. Clinical signs were evaluated with the Reflux Finding Score (RFS), Reflux Sign Assessment (RSA), and Reflux Sign Assessment-10 (RSA-10). Sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for each instrument and their combinations.

Results

A total of 542 LPRD patients and 204 healthy controls were included. The RSS was the PROM with the highest SE (95.4%), whereas RSS-12 reported the highest SP (94.7%). RSA had the highest SE (94.0%), and RSA-10 reported the highest SP (76.3%). The highest SE and SP of combination tools were found for RSS+RSA (90.4%) and RSS+RSA-10 (99.4%), respectively. RSS+RSA-10 achieved the highest PPV value (99.7%) and RSS+RSA had the highest NPV (79.3%). Overall, the RSS demonstrated the greatest diagnostic accuracy with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.985. The combination RSS+RSA reported an AUC of 0.934.

Conclusion

The combination of RSS and RSA provided the most accurate diagnostic performance, maximizing SE, SP, PPV, and NPV. This combination offers enhanced utility for the preliminary diagnosis of LPRD.

### Pharyngoesophageal pH monitoring [^113EWYG8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Pharyngeal acid reflux events may be significant in the pathogenesis of various supraesophageal manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Intragroup variation and an extensive overlap among subject groups and normal controls make proximal esophageal 24-hour pH monitoring studies unreliable for the diagnosis of pharyngeal reflux. However, the clinical value of pharyngeal pH monitoring still remains uncertain. A 24-hour pharyngeal pH monitoring study has shown that at least some pharyngeal reflux events occur in most healthy subjects, mainly in the upright position. Based on these data, values for the upper limits of normal for total pharyngeal acid exposure time and pharyngeal acid events have been determined. This study provides clinicians with reference values for physiologic pharyngeal reflux, but the parameters of abnormal pharyngeal reflux events are still unknown. More research is needed before this practice can become part of the routine evaluation of patients with pharyngeal, laryngeal, respiratory, or ear, nose, and throat symptoms or disorders.

### Sensitive pepsin immunoassay for detection of laryngopharyngeal reflux [^113wSEtw]. The Laryngoscope (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

To determine whether measurement of pepsin in throat sputum by immunoassay could be used as a sensitive and reliable method for detecting laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) compared with 24-hour double-probe (esophageal and pharyngeal) pH monitoring.

Study Design

Patients with clinical LPR undergoing pH monitoring provided throat sputum samples during the reflux-testing period for pepsin measurement using enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay.

Results

Pepsin assay results from 63 throat sputum samples obtained from 23 study subjects were compared with their pH monitoring data. Twenty-two percent (14/63) of the sputum samples correlated the presence of pepsin with LPR (pH ≤ 4 at the pharyngeal probe), of which the median concentration of pepsin was 0.18 microg/mL (range 0.003–22 microg/mL). Seventy-eight percent (49/63) of the samples unassociated with (pharyngeal) reflux contained no detectible pepsin. Mean pH values for pepsin-positive samples were significantly lower than negative samples at both esophageal probe (pH 2.2 vs. pH 5.0) (P < .01) and the pharyngeal probe (pH 4.4 vs. pH 5.8) (P < .01). When the pepsin assay results were compared with the pharyngeal pH data for detecting reflux (events pH ≤ 4), the pepsin immunoassay was 100% sensitive and 89% specific for LPR.

Conclusions

Detection of pepsin in throat sputum by immunoassay appears to provide a sensitive, noninvasive method to detect LPR.

### Reducing the duration of 24-hour multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH monitoring for laryngopharyngeal reflux [^112emk7y]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates that shorter monitoring durations for 24‐hour MII‐pH monitoring can effectively maintain high diagnostic sensitivity for hypopharyngeal reflux episodes in patients with LPR. Specifically, monitoring for 6 hours achieves more than 80% sensitivity, whereas a 10‐hour duration is sufficient to meet 90% sensitivity, depending on the timing of the monitoring. These findings highlight the potential for reducing monitoring time, improving patient comfort without compromising diagnostic accuracy.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^114WqV4S]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Extraesophageal GERD — although GERD may be a contributor to extraesophageal symptoms in some patients, careful evaluation for other causes should be considered for patients with laryngeal symptoms, chronic cough, and asthma. Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of potential extraesophageal symptoms of GERD is limited by lack of a gold-standard test, variable symptoms, and other disorders which may cause similar symptoms. Endoscopy is not sufficient to confirm or refute the presence of extraesophageal GERD. Because of difficulty in distinguishing between patients with laryngeal symptoms and normal controls, salivary pepsin testing is not recommended for evaluation of patients with extraesophageal reflux symptoms. For patients whose extraesophageal symptoms have not responded to a trial of twice-daily PPIs, we recommend upper endoscopy, ideally off PPIs for 2–4 wk; if EGD shows EE, that does not confirm that the extraesophageal symptoms are from GERD, and patients still may need pH-impedance testing. For patients with extraesophageal symptoms, we do not routinely recommend oropharyngeal or pharyngeal pH monitoring.

### The diagnostic value of pepsin detection in saliva for gastro-esophageal reflux disease: a preliminary study from China [^114GWRYA]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) refers to "a condition that develops when the reflux of stomach contents causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications" in the Montreal Classification. As one of the most common gastrointestinal diseases, its prevalence has increased in the last few decades, leading to a considerable healthcare burden and low quality of life. Current methods employed in the diagnosis of GERD include GERD questionnaires, "PPI test", endoscopy and ambulatory esophageal reflux monitoring. However, the sensitivity and specificity of such methods have been questioned. Recent studies showed that the PPI test and structured questionnaires did not obtain ideal sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of GERD. Endoscopy is not adequate since non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) is more prevalent than erosive reflux disease in the GERD population. Reflux monitoring, including esophageal pH metry and impedance-pH metry, although currently used as the available gold standard, has a lower sensitivity in patients with NERD compared to those with reflux esophagitis and lacks reproducibility. After all, none of the current approaches has been proven to be a reliable tool for GERD, and more specific, non-invasive and cost effective diagnostic methods are warranted.

Pepsin, a potential factor contributing to the mucosal tissues when gastro-esophageal reflux (GER) occurs, is a protease originating from pepsinogen synthesized by the gastric chief cells. Pepsin has been found in many different tissue samples such as laryngeal mucosa, paranasal sinus mucosa, saliva, middle ear effusion, tracheal secretions and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The presence of pepsin in esophagus or more proximal sites is indicative of reflux, suggesting that pepsin may be used as a biomarker for the objective assessment of GERD. Some studies have shown that pepsin detection in the sputum and/or saliva can be regarded as a sensitive, non-invasive method for the diagnosis of the proximal reflux of gastric contents or laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). Thus, in the present study, we aimed to determine whether the use of pepsin determination in saliva could be useful for diagnosing GERD in the adult cohort from China with Peptest (RD Biomed Ltd. Hull, UK).

### Pepsin and oropharyngeal pH monitoring to diagnose patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux [^115ZRcY2]. The Laryngoscope (2020). Medium credibility.

Oropharyngeal pH Monitoring

Simultaneous to MII‐pH, patients had to undergo Dx‐pH as well. The Restech Dx‐pH measurement system, version 1.0 (Restech Dx‐pH, Restech, San Diego, CA) was used. Therefore, a probe was placed in a standardized way, as recommended by the provider in the oropharynx above the upper esophageal sphincter. The measurements are evaluated by the Ryan score, which was considered to be pathological when higher 9.4 in the upright position (pH < 5.5) or higher 6.8 in the supine position (pH < 5.0). 26

Pepsin Determination in Saliva

Subjects collected the saliva samples on waking, 1 hour after finishing lunch, and 1 hour after finishing dinner during the MII‐pH and simultaneous Dx‐pH monitoring period. The early morning sample was collected before eating, drinking, smoking, or brushing the teeth of the patients. Saliva was collected into tubes containing 0.5 mL of 0.01 M citric acid. Subjects returned the samples immediately after collection, and the samples were sent to the laboratory.

Samples were refrigerated at 4°C and analyzed within 2 days after collection.

Pepsin values were determined in a standardized procedure using Peptest (RDBiomed), as previously described. 7

The value of 16 ng/mL was used as cutoff for a positive sample (as determined by the manufacturer). Samples with a pepsin concentration above the upper limit of 500 ng/mL had 501 ng/mL in the results. The mean value out of three samples was used to perform correlation analysis.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS statistical analysis software, version 25.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL). Data were compared using a paired t test or the Wilcoxon signed rank test. If normally distributed, datasets were additionally presented as means and standard deviation. Multiple group comparisons were performed using a one‐way analysis of variance, followed by Kolmogorov–Smirnov Test for normal distributed data and the Kruskall–Wallis Test with Dunns comparison for non‐normal data. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to determine and compare the sensitivity and specificity of different pepsin cutoff concentrations and their predictive value to diagnose or refute the diagnosis of GERD and extra‐esophagel/laryngophyrangeal reflux‐related symptoms. Likelihood ratios were calculated, and P < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.

### Reducing the duration of 24-hour multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH monitoring for laryngopharyngeal reflux [^114zdRPa]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Patient Demographics

The total number of patients who underwent the complete 24‐hour HEMII‐pH monitoring was 192. Among them, 50 patients had no hypopharyngeal reflux episodes and were excluded from the analysis, resulting in 140 patients being included in the analysis. The demographic characteristics of the study population are summarized in Table 1. The mean age of the patients was 53.4 years (range: 22‐78). Among the participants, 62% were male (87 patients) and 38% were female (53 patients). The mean BMI was 24.8 ± 3.7. Additionally, 25% of the patients reported smoking, and 32% consumed alcohol. Hypopharyngeal reflux episodes were distributed as follows: 65% experienced 1 to 5 reflux episodes, 17% experienced 6 to 10 episodes, 5% experienced 16 to 20 episodes, and 4% experienced 21 to 29 episodes (Table 1).

Table 1
Demographic Characteristics of Patients

Sensitivity of LPR Diagnosis According to the Monitoring Duration

The first analysis was conducted to examine how sensitivity changes compared to the 24‐hour HEMII‐pH monitoring based on the time that had passed since the start of the monitoring. In our duration‐based sensitivity analysis, the sensitivity for diagnosing LPR steadily increased as the monitoring duration extended. At 1 hour from the start of monitoring, the sensitivity was 0.4, and by 2 hours, it had risen to 0.55. With each additional hour, sensitivity continued to increase, reaching 0.664 at 3 hours, 0.757 at 4 hours, and 0.779 at 5 hours. When the monitoring was conducted for 6 hours from the start of the test, the sensitivity reached 0.814, indicating that with a 6‐hour monitoring period, more than 80% of the patients diagnosed with LPR in the full 24‐hour HEMII‐pH monitoring would also be diagnosed within the shorter duration. As the duration continued, the sensitivity further improved. When the monitoring was extended to 10 hours, the sensitivity reached 0.9, indicating that LPR could be diagnosed with 90% sensitivity within this duration. At 18 hours, it reached 0.95, and at 23 hours, the sensitivity was 1, identical to that of the full 24‐hour HEMII‐pH monitoring (Figure 1).

### Updates to the modern diagnosis of GERD: Lyon consensus 2.0 [^113hSmH9]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

Ambulatory pH-impedance monitoring off antisecretory therapy has diagnostic value in unproven GERD when typical reflux symptoms are associated with excessive belching, when rumination is suspected, and when pulmonary symptoms are being evaluated for association with GERD.

While pH-impedance monitoring performed off PPI provides similar 24-hour AET data as catheter-based pH monitoring or day 1 of wireless pH monitoring, more reflux episodes are detected because of higher sensitivity of the impedance component in identifying reflux episodes independent of pH. Accurate reflux episode counts predict GERD symptom response when elevated, especially in regurgitation-predominant GERD, although expert interpretation is required to overcome inaccuracies of automated analysis. Additionally, the use of pH-impedance monitoring over pH monitoring alone shifts diagnoses from functional heartburn to reflux hypersensitivity, since additional reflux episodes identified irrespective of acidic content using pH-impedance monitoring may be associated with symptoms. Mean nocturnal baseline impedance (MNBI) measurement from pH-impedance monitoring provides longitudinal evidence of reflux-induced mucosal damage, but postreflux swallow induced peristaltic wave (PSPW) analysis remains predominantly a research tool useful in phenotyping rather than diagnosing GERD.

High AET is uncommon in patients with 'isolated' extraoesophageal symptoms, and pH-impedance monitoring seems to improve diagnostic yield, partly because of the added value of reflux number counts, reflux-symptom association testing, and parameters like MNBI. A study of 156 patients with chronic cough undergoing pH-impedance found that pathological AET and low baseline impedance increased the probability of PPI response. In small prospective cohorts of patients with laryngeal symptoms and laryngoscopic signs suspicious for reflux, pH-impedance testing off PPI therapy confirmed GERD in less than a fifth of patients independent of symptoms or laryngoscopic findings, suggesting that pH-impedance monitoring up front has important value in identifying the select few patients with extraoesophageal symptoms who could benefit from antireflux therapy(figure 1). Up-front physiological testing is more cost-effective than empiric PPI therapy with extra-oesophageal symptoms, given the high numbers needed to treat for PPI response.

### A prospective controlled study investigating odor identification in laryngopharyngeal reflux [^113G5yzh]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To psychophysically evaluate olfaction in patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR).

Study Design

Prospective controlled study.

Setting

Tertiary medical center.

Methods

From January 2021 to January 2022, patients with LPR diagnosed with hypopharyngeal-esophageal multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH monitoring underwent psychophysical evaluation of the sense of smell. Reflux symptoms and findings were assessed with the Reflux Symptom Score (RSS) and Reflux Sign Assessment (RSA). Nasal symptoms were assessed through the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test 22 (SNOT-22). From pre- to posttreatment, patients underwent identification Sniffin' Sticks test and olfactory cleft examination. Clinical outcomes were compared between LPR patients and healthy individuals.

Results

In total, 107 patients and 76 healthy individuals completed the evaluations. LPR patients reported significant higher RSS, RSA, and SNOT-22 scores. Psychophysical olfactory evaluations were significantly lower in reflux patients compared with controls, while there were no significant differences in olfactory cleft score. RSS and RSA significantly improved from baseline to 3 months posttreatment. SNOT-22, olfactory cleft endoscopy scale, and psychophysical olfactory evaluations did not change throughout treatment. Patients with higher number of acid pharyngeal reflux events reported lower psychophysical olfactory scores (P = 0.025).

Conclusion

LPR disease was associated with low odor identification results in patients without olfactory cleft abnormalities. The sense of smell did not improve after 3-month therapy. Future controlled studies using threshold, discrimination, and identification testing are needed.

### 24-hour multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH in proton pump inhibitor nonresponders vs responders in patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux [^111BHrmR]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of reflux in proton pump inhibitor (PPI) nonresponders vs responders in patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) by using 24-hour multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH (MII-pH) monitoring.

Study Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

A tertiary care otolaryngology clinic.

Methods

Patients with typical LPR symptoms showing > 1 proximal reflux episode were considered to have LPR and investigated prospectively. Patients were prescribed high-dose PPI twice daily and followed up for at least 2 months. Patients with LPR showing a ≥ 50% decrease in the follow-up reflux symptom index score during treatment periods as compared with pretreatment were defined as responders; others were defined as nonresponders. Various parameters in 24-hour MII-pH monitoring between nonresponders and responders with LPR were compared with Student's t test and receiver operating characteristic curve.

Results

Eighty patients were diagnosed with LPR and categorized as nonresponders (n = 19) and responders (n = 61). Proximal all reflux time and proximal longest reflux time in various MII parameters were higher in responders than in nonresponders (P = 0.0040 and .0216, respectively). Proximal all reflux time > 0.000517% was a better cutoff value to predict responders with LPR as compared with the proximal longest reflux time > 0.61 minutes (sensitivity + specificity: 1.317 vs 1.291).

Conclusion

Proximal all reflux time in various 24-hour MII-pH monitoring parameters can be helpful to predict the response to PPI therapy in patients with LPR. These findings will help establish a personalized therapeutic scheme for patients with LPR.

### Relationship between laryngopharyngeal reflux disease and gastroesophageal reflux disease based on synchronous esophageal and oropharyngeal Dx-pH monitoring [^115Vg6xu]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To use the synchronous esophageal and oropharyngeal Dx-pH monitoring analysis to investigate the relationship between LPRD and GERD.

Materials and Methods

Synchronous esophageal and oropharyngeal Dx-pH monitoring, electronic gastroscopy, reflux symptom index (RSI) and gastroesophageal reflux questionnaire (Gerd-Q) were collected from 514 consecutive patients and comparative analysis was done.

Results

A total of 85 patients had positive Ryan score and 251 cases had positive DeMeester or acid exposure time percent (AET) ≥ 4.2%. Moreover, 61.2% (52/85) of all LPRD cases were pure LPRD without GERD. There was no statistical difference in the acid exposure to oropharynx between pure LPRD group and LPRD+GERD group (U test, P > 0.05). Furthermore, there were no statistical differences in the other esophageal reflux data between pure GERD without LPRD group and LPRD+GERD group (U test, P > 0.05) apart from the number of episodes, which was higher in the pure GERD group than in LPRD+GERD group (U test, P = 0.027). Additionally, 149 patients were diagnosed with reflux esophagitis by electronic gastroscopy. No significant difference in the acid exposure to oropharynx was seen between different grades of reflux esophagitis (U test, P > 0.05). Among the LPRD patients, 32 cases (37.6%) were negative for Gerd-Q, Dx-pH esophageal probe and gastroscopy.

Conclusion

The results of synchronous esophageal and oropharyngeal Dx-pH monitoring demonstrated that LPRD and GERD could co-exist as separate medical conditions. Our data suggest that some LPRD are not accompanied by GERD, and that LPRD is not secondary to severe GERD.

### Objective detection of esophagopharyngeal reflux in patients with hoarseness and endoscopic signs of laryngeal inflammation [^114roC7V]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Goals

We aimed to quantify pharyngeal exposure to gastric contents in patients diagnosed with reflux-related hoarseness and healthy controls using new diagnostic techniques.

Background

Hoarseness with typical signs on laryngoscopy is commonly thought to be caused by esophagopharyngeal reflux. New methods are proposed to assess pharyngeal exposure to gastric contents. They are suggested to measure: (1) liquid or mixed gas-liquid acid and nonacid reflux with impedance pH, (2) aerosolized acid reflux (Dx-pH measuring system), and (3) pepsin in the saliva.

Study

Twenty-one patients with hoarseness and positive laryngoscopy and 10 controls underwent simultaneous impedance pH, Dx-pH monitoring, and saliva pepsin sampling (5 samples in 24 h).

Results

Of the 21 patients, 10 had impedance pH-detected reflux plus at least 1 other test positive. These patients were more likely to have symptomatic relief after proton pump inhibitor therapy. Three of the 21 patients had all 3 tests positive and 4 had all tests negative. None of the controls had impedance pH-detected reflux. Two controls had a positive Dx-pH "RYAN score" and 1 control had > 1 saliva sample positive for pepsin. Only 11% of Dx-pH drops to pH < 4, 15% pH drops to pH < 5, and 10% of pH drops to pH < 5.5 coincided with impedance pH-detected reflux in the esophageal body. Positive pepsin saliva samples were preceded by more reflux events [3 (range, 0 to 10)] in the previous 60 minutes than negative samples [0 (range, 0 to 7)] (P < 0.0001).

Conclusion

A subgroup of patients with hoarseness (10/21) had objective detection of the esophagopharyngeal reflux. We propose that these patients are more likely to benefit from further intense antireflux therapy. Detection of pepsin in the saliva may be a useful screening tool in these patients.

### Temporal association between respiratory events and reflux in patients with obstructive sleep apnea and laryngopharyngeal reflux [^114dw4Um]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

The aim of the current study was to test the hypothesis that there is a temporal correlation between reflux episodes and respiratory events in patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux and obstructive sleep apnea.

Methods

Adults with clinically diagnosed laryngopharyngeal reflux confirmed by two validated instruments (reflux symptom index ≥ 13 and reflux finding score ≥ 7) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) underwent full polysomnography with concomitant and synchronized multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH esophageal monitoring. The apnea-hypopnea and arousal indexes that occurred 15, 30, and 45 minutes before and after each reflux episode were recorded and compared to full-night apnea and hypopnea and arousal index.

Results

We studied 27 patients (14 males, age 51.7 ± 9.1 years, body mass index 32.4 ± 4.2 kg/m²) with laryngopharyngeal reflux (reflux symptom index 16 ± 2 and reflux finding score 12 ± 3) and OSA (apnea-hypopnea index = 32.3 ± 28.4 events/h). We evaluated 102 reflux episodes. Almost half of the reflux episodes occurred while awake (43.1%) and only five reflux episodes (4.9%) occurred during an obstructive respiratory event. The apnea and hypopnea and arousal indexes 15, 30, and 45 minutes before and after reflux episodes were lower than full-night apnea and hypopnea and arousal indexes, respectively.

Conclusions

Among patients with well-established laryngopharyngeal reflux and OSA, there is no temporal association between reflux and obstructive respiratory events. Even though the data comprised a small sample size, it seems that a more complex mechanism is involved with these two highly prevalent diseases.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for oesophageal manometry and oesophageal reflux monitoring [^115KRsuW]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

2.8 Reflux monitoring with pH or pH/impedance is not recommended in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease symptoms responsive to proton pump inhibitor therapy in who antireflux surgery is not planned.

GRADE evidence: Moderate

Strength recommendation: Strong

In patients with typical gastro-oesophageal reflux disease symptoms and a good response to proton pump inhibitor therapy, the correct diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease can be made on clinical grounds and has a high sensitivity but relatively low specificity. Performing reflux monitoring with pH or pH/impedance in these patients does not increase significantly the diagnostic yield. In patients with non-cardiac chest pain or other extra oesophageal symptoms, an initial therapeutic trial with a proton pump inhibitor is cost-effective compared with initial reflux monitoring tests. Increased acid reflux is the most frequent reason for chest pain of oesophageal origin. If patients have a positive response to a proton pump inhibitor, further functional tests are not recommended. However, if patients with typical gastro-oesophageal reflux disease symptoms (heartburn or acid regurgitation) wish to undergo antireflux surgery, preoperative reflux monitoring off proton pump inhibitors is indicated. If patients with atypical symptoms (chest pain, throat and respiratory symptoms) choose to continue their treatment with antireflux surgery, they should undergo reflux monitoring to confirm the relationship between their atypical symptoms and reflux.

2.9 In patients with heartburn or regurgitation not responding to twice daily proton pump inhibitors, reflux monitoring should be performed with pH/impedance monitoring, rather than pH monitoring alone. This technique allows diagnosis of increased acid exposure, association between symptoms and acid or non-acid reflux, and identification of phenotypes — ie, non-erosive reflux disease, hypersensitive oesophagus and functional heartburn.

GRADE evidence: Moderate

Strength recommendation: Strong

Case series of patients undergoing oesophageal pH monitoring for persistent gastro-oesophageal reflux disease symptoms despite proton pump inhibitor therapy reveal that persistent excess acid exposure despite taking a once daily proton pump inhibitor is seen in 30% of patients. In patients studied while taking twice daily proton pump inhibitors, persistent acid exposure is very uncommon, affecting around 7% of patients with heartburn or acid regurgitation and 1% of patients with chest pain, throat or respiratory symptoms. It is therefore logical to suggest in the first instance that in patients with persistent symptoms despite a once daily dose of proton pump inhibitor that the dose is increased to twice daily.

2.1 Automatic analysis of oesophageal pH recordings and symptom association with acid reflux episodes is adequate for pH monitoring in patients, provided the recording is checked for artefacts and major technical issues and that times of meals and symptoms have been accurately recorded.

GRADE evidence: Low

Strength recommendation: Strong

2.2 Analysis of oesophageal pH/impedance recordings requires manual editing of reflux episodes and symptoms, to obtain accurate reflux quantification and reflux symptom association assessment.

GRADE evidence: Moderate

Strength recommendation: Strong

2.3 To enhance the chance of establishing a diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and a symptom association with acid reflux, patients undergoing pH monitoring should not take acid suppression.

GRADE evidence: Moderate

Strength recommendation: Strong

2.4. In patients with heartburn or acid regurgitation symptoms not responding to a proton pump inhibitor twice daily, if pH/impedance monitoring is required it should be undertaken on proton pump inhibitors if the patient has previous pathological endoscopic or pH monitoring findings, and the study should be performed off proton pump inhibitors if they have no previous such demonstration of pathological gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.

GRADE evidence: Low

Strength recommendation: Conditional/weak

2.5 In patients with heartburn, acid regurgitation or chest pain, symptom association with reflux episodes is best assessed with both the symptom association probability and symptom index.

GRADE evidence: Low

Strength recommendation: Conditional/weak

2.6 In patients with throat or respiratory symptoms, dual probe distal oesophageal and proximal oesophageal or pharyngeal pH monitoring has no advantage over single probe distal oesophageal pH monitoring.

GRADE evidence: Low

Strength recommendation: Conditional/weak

### Updates to the modern diagnosis of GERD: Lyon consensus 2.0 [^111ssd36]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

Troublesome typical symptoms alone may be enough for antisecretory medication trials, but up-front oesophageal testing is suggested for all other symptom categories and in proton pump inhibitor (PPI) non-responders, prior to invasive GERD management or prior to long-term medical management.

Actionable GERD constitutes settings where management requires long-term acid suppression, an escalation of medical management, or consideration of interventional (ie, not easily reversible) management options for GERD such as laparoscopic fundoplication, magnetic sphincter augmentation (MSA), endoscopic GERD therapies or bariatric surgery, where high confidence in GERD diagnosis is essential.

The Montreal consensus defines GERD as the reflux of stomach contents into the oesophagus causing troublesome symptoms and/or complications. However, not all 'troublesome' symptoms can be directly linked to reflux of gastric content, and symptoms alone are insufficient for a conclusive diagnosis. Nevertheless, pragmatic continuation of empiric antisecretory therapy is considered appropriate when typical symptoms (heartburn, chest pain, regurgitation) improve with GERD treatment trials(figure 1), although response could also be due to placebo effect. In parallel, assumptions of GERD relationships with cough, hoarseness and other 'isolated' extraoesophageal symptoms (ie, in the absence of typical GERD symptoms) overestimated atypical GERD diagnoses leading to inappropriate use of antisecretory drugs, high economic burden and waste of limited testing resources(figure 1). Use of Lyon consensus criteria is anticipated to improve diagnostic specificity and confidence. While objective testing prior to long-term medical management of typical symptoms is optimal, practicality and cost-effectiveness need further study.

Figure 1
Troublesome typical and atypical symptoms suspicious for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and usual approach to evaluation of these symptoms. An empiric trial of antisecretory therapy is appropriate for typical symptoms in the absence of alarm symptoms. Prolonged wireless pH monitoring is most appropriate for quantification of reflux burden with typical symptoms, although pH-impedance or even pH only monitoring may be options depending on availability and expertise. Belching, cough and asthma may have a potential association with reflux episodes. Supragastric belching and rumination need to be identified, preferably using high-resolution impedance manometry (HRIM) and managed with behavioural therapy. Up-front testing is performed primarily to rule out a reflux basis for symptoms for all other atypical symptoms. Pulmonary evaluation and laryngoscopy serve to rule out primary non-GERD disorders, and may precede oesophageal physiological testing.

### Clinical value of wireless pH-monitoring of gastro-esophageal reflux in children before and after proton pump inhibitors [^111UdNGG]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is defined as a condition that develops when the reflux of stomach content into the esophagus causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications. The most common GERD symptoms in adults are heartburn and regurgitation, with esophageal complications such as reflux esophagitis, hemorrhage, stricture, Barrett's esophagus, and adenocarcinoma. In children, GERD can also manifest as vomiting, poor weight gain, failure to thrive, dysphagia, cough, laryngitis, and wheezing. It commonly occurs with regurgitation in healthy children from birth; however only 4% of the infants have daily signs of reflux at one year of age.

Ambulatory 24-hour esophageal pH-metry with a nasal wire system was previously considered the gold standard in diagnosing GERD. However, a nasal catheter system is unpleasant for the patients and may restrict reflux-provoking activities, resulting in falsely lower values on pH-metry. Therefore, a wireless system was developed using a capsule attached to the mucosa wall of the esophagus for electronic pH monitoring. This so-called Bravo pH Monitoring System (Medtronic Inc. Minneapolis, MN) has proven to be both safe and tolerable in adults, as well as among children. The possibility of ambulatory pH-metry also facilitates diagnosing GERD. In pediatric patients suspected to have GERD of whom many may be neurologically impaired or have certain genetic disorders, it is even more important to provide a less disturbing method for pH-metry.

Another advantage is the possibility of pH-monitoring for 48 hours. By extending the measurement, the investigation will be more robust to intra-assay variations of refluxes over time. Still, there is no consensus whether a natural day to day variation of pH < 4 should be considered when testing for reflux as some studies, but not others, demonstrate differences in refluxes over longer periods. By using 48-hour ambulatory pH-monitoring, the second 24 hours could alternatively be utilized to measure the effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPI).

To date, PPI are considered the most effective medications in inhibiting gastric acid secretion and have shown to decrease the number of reflux episodes in patients with GERD. In adult patients screened for GERD, the wireless pH-monitoring system proved useful for evaluating the reduction of acid exposure during PPI medication given on the second day of measurement. To the best of our knowledge, wireless pH-monitoring system testing with and without PPI has not yet been evaluated in children.

### Association between laryngeal pepsin levels and the presence of vocal fold polyps [^114Dawqh]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective To determine whether pepsin, the main component of refluxed gastric contents, is significantly associated with vocal fold polyps and to evaluate the diagnostic value of pepsin in vocal fold polyps' tissues. Study Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University. Subjects and Methods The study included 32 patients with vocal fold polyps and 16 healthy controls between 2011 and 2012. Reflux symptom index and reflux finding score assessments, 24-hour combined multichannel intraluminal impedance and pH monitoring, and biopsy of the vocal fold polyp tissues or posterior laryngeal mucosa (healthy controls) for immunohistochemical pepsin staining were performed. Results The expression of pepsin was significantly higher in patients with vocal fold polyps than in controls (28/32, 75% vs 5/16, 31.25%; P < .001). The pepsin levels were significantly positively correlated with upright position pharyngeal acid reflux and esophageal reflux parameters adjusted by age. Based on pepsin staining data, the sensitivity and negative predictive values of 24-hour pH monitoring, the reflux symptom index, and the reflux finding score were 70% to 84.62%, whereas their specificity and positive predictive values were relatively low (20%-31.58%). Conclusion Pepsin reflux may be a risk factor for vocal fold polyps formation. In addition, pepsin immunohistochemical analysis of polyp biopsy samples appears to be a more sensitive and effective test for diagnosing laryngopharyngeal reflux than the reflux symptom index, the reflux finding score, and 24-hour pH monitoring in a clinical setting.

### Updates to the modern diagnosis of GERD: Lyon consensus 2.0 [^116S6BAw]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

Ambulatory pH-impedance monitoring on PPI is of value in proven GERD with persisting symptoms despite optimal therapy.

When pH-only testing is performed on PPI, very low AET values are recorded: median AET was 1.2% on once-daily PPI and 0.3% on a twice-daily regimen in 131 patients with both typical and atypical reflux symptoms. Similarly low values were reported in 66 healthy volunteers undergoing pH-impedance testing on twice-daily PPI. Although acidic reflux episodes generally become weakly acidic or non-acidic on PPI, both can be detected using pH-impedance monitoring, and symptoms could be triggered by persisting reflux episodes independent of pH. In a study of 39 patients with refractory reflux symptoms tested both on therapy (pH-impedance monitoring) and off therapy (wireless pH monitoring), abnormal AET off therapy was associated with weakly acid reflux episodes on therapy. Further, MNBI from pH-impedance monitoring on therapy may have diagnostic value, while PSPW remains a research tool in further phenotyping patients with previously proven GERD.

Ambulatory pH-impedance monitoring performed on antisecretory medications may help decision-making regarding escalation of GERD management beyond pharmacotherapy. In a randomised trial comparing ARS to medical management in patients with heartburn incompletely responding to PPI, although the likelihood of abnormal reflux burden on pH-impedance monitoring was small (78 patients from a starting cohort of 366 patients, 21%), ARS resulted in symptom relief in 67% among 27 patients, in contrast to 28% with continued medical management (p < 0.001). In another study of 85 patients with heartburn and regurgitation in the context of previously proven GERD studied with pH-impedance testing on twice a day PPI regimen, AET > 4.0% and/or > 80 reflux episodes resulted in 85% reporting symptom benefit from MSA when this was offered, especially when regurgitation was the dominant symptom (93%) compared with heartburn (60%). Abnormal pH-impedance metrics on once-daily PPI therapy normalised with maximal PPI therapy in 71.1% of 45 symptomatic patients. Further, 89% of 38 patients with refractory reflux symptoms and abnormal pH-impedance metrics on maximal PPI therapy benefited from ARS on retrospective analysis.

Thus, in patients with proven GERD and persisting symptoms, pH-impedance monitoring on therapy can help phenotype patients and identify ongoing reflux burden that may respond to ARS, irrespective of how GERD was previously proven(figure 2).

### The importance of pH reflux monitoring test for the management of low-grade esophagitis in Chinese patients [^117VGgSH]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Low-grade esophagitis (grade A and B) are no longer believed as confirmatory evidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease, but there were no data about the association of low-grade esophagitis with pathological acid reflux (PAR) in China. This study aimed to summarize the proportion of PAR in the patients with low-grade esophagitis and to explore the differential factors between low-grade esophagitis patients with and without PAR.

Methods

Database of the patients accepted 24-hour pH monitoring in the motility laboratory of a tertiary center was retrospectively searched, and the patients were diagnosed as low-grade esophagitis before the procedure was recruited. The demographics, symptoms and high-resolution manometry and pH monitoring parameters were compared between the patients with pathological and physiological acid reflux and between patients with grade A and B esophagitis.

Results

About 24% of grade A and 55% of grade B esophagitis patients had pathological acid reflux. The demographics, symptoms, and almost all high-resolution manometry findings were similar in patients with pathological and physiological acid reflux. About two-thirds of the participants with physiological acid reflux reported symptom improvement after PPI administration. All participants with PPI-resistant symptoms were with physiological acid reflux.

Conclusion

The proportion of PAR in low-grade esophagitis is not high. For patients with low-grade esophagitis in China, especially the patients with grade A esophagitis, regardless of symptom change, reflux monitoring is possibly needed for the patients whose esophageal mucosa break is not improved after 8 weeks of PPI treatment.

Methods

Patients

This is a retrospective observational study. The data was obtained from the Chronic Cough Database of the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji University, between March 2018 and January 2023. After a detailed analysis of the medical history, comprehensive physical examination, and capsaicin cough sensitivity testing, the etiology of chronic cough was determined based on laboratory examinations including chest X-ray or chest CT, pulmonary function tests, bronchial provocation tests, induced sputum cytology, MII-pH monitoring, etc. The diagnosis of GERC was based on the international consensus proposed by the American College of Chest Physicians and the Chinese Medical Association in conjunction with the international consensus on GERD. When the following criteria were met, GERC was considered: chronic cough, with daytime cough being common; AET > 6.0%, SI ≥ 50% and/or SAP ≥ 95% on MII-pH monitoring, cough improved significantly or disappeared after step-by-step anti-reflux treatment (cough symptom score decreased by > 50%). If AET > 6.0% and acid SI ≥ 50% and/or acid SAP ≥ 95%, the patient was diagnosed with acid GERC. If the gastric acid reflux was negative, AET ≤ 6.0%, but non-acid SI ≥ 50% and/or non-acid SAP ≥ 95%, and the patient responded to step-by-step anti-reflux treatment, then the diagnosis was non-acid GERC. In some patients, their cough was partially improved after receiving treatment for chronic cough caused by factors other than GERC. However, their cough completely disappeared after receiving combined anti-reflux treatment. As a result, the final diagnosis was determined as GERC combined with other etiologies.

### Value of adjunctive evidence from MII-pH monitoring and high-resolution manometry in inconclusive GERD patients with AET 4–6 [^113ZNnvm]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) refers to various symptoms and/or complications caused by gastric contents refluxing into the esophagus, mouth, or lungs, – with a worldwide prevalence of 33%, resulting in poor quality of life, impaired social activity, and heavy economic burden.

GERD is often empirically diagnosed by typical symptoms (heartburn and regurgitation), and then tested for a response to proton pump inhibitors (PPI) therapy. When PPI test is negative or when alarm symptoms raise suspicion for complications or other diseases, diagnostic tests such as upper endoscopy, esophageal pH/pH-impedance monitoring, and esophageal manometry are warranted. However, there is not a single "gold standard" to diagnose patients with GERD because of the different diagnostic tests with sometimes inconclusive results, causing big dilemmas in clinical practice.

Compared with patients in Western countries, Chinese have lower reflux burden. According to the Lyon Consensus, few patients with GERD typical symptoms can be diagnosed as GERD. Some patients with acid exposure time (AET) 4–6% who have heartburn and/or regurgitation respond to PPI well or actually suffer esophageal mucosa impairment but do not satisfy Lyon criteria. The Lyon Consensus recommends total reflux episodes, symptom index (SI) / symptom-association probability (SAP), mean nocturnal baseline impedance (MNBI) and post-reflux swallow-induced peristaltic wave index (PSPWI) from multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH (MII-pH) monitoring and esophago-gastric junction contractile integral (EGJ-CI), ineffective esophageal motility (IEM) and hiatus hernia from high-resolution manometry (HRM) as adjunctive evidence to help diagnose suspicious patients with confidence. However, no unified thresholds for them have been built until now. Our study aimed (1) to investigate the difference and similarities of reflux monitoring, endoscopic findings, and esophageal motility among patients with AET > 6%, AET 4–6% and AET < 4%; (2) to explore the value of adjunctive evidence from MII-monitoring and HRM in diagnosing inconclusive GERD patients with AET 4–6%.

5.8 Hypomagnesemia and Mineral Metabolism

Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, and in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. Hypomagnesemia may lead to hypocalcemia and/or hypokalemia and may exacerbate underlying hypocalcemia in at-risk patients. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.

For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Consider monitoring magnesium and calcium levels prior to initiation of pantoprazole sodium and periodically while on treatment in patients with a preexisting risk of hypocalcemia (e.g., hypoparathyroidism). Supplement with magnesium and/or calcium as necessary. If hypocalcemia is refractory to treatment, consider discontinuing the PPI.

5.9 Tumorigenicity

Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole sodium.

Neuroendocrine Tumors

Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors.

### 'This has given me the peace of mind I needed': ethnographic insights into Barrett's oesophagus screening using the capsule sponge test [^113EGHZ6]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Barrett's oesophagus (BO) is a metaplastic change in the lining of the oesophagus in which normal squamous epithelium is replaced by specialised or intestinalised columnar epithelium. Triggered by chronic exposure of the oesophageal lining to gastro-oesophageal reflux, BO is a known risk factor or precancer for oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC). Overall survival rates for this type of cancer are poor, with 12% of people surviving for more than 10 years after diagnosis. This is usually attributed to the late stage at which many oesophageal cancers are diagnosed — one audit stated that 44.9% of diagnoses in 2020/2021 were stage 4. A diagnosis of BO is thought to offer an opportunity to improve survival rates. Those diagnosed with the condition in the UK are offered regular white light endoscopic surveillance, usually every 2–5 years depending on the severity of their BO. Surveillance aims to detect dysplasia, which can be treated with endoscopic therapy to prevent the development of OAC.

At present, the diagnosis of BO relies on the use of endoscopy, which is invasive and expensive. Researchers in recent decades have sought to develop easier ways to diagnose the condition without endoscopy, such as using a capsule sponge or ballon device linked with biomarker tests. The capsule sponge is a pill on a string that patients swallow. The coating of the capsule dissolves in the stomach to reveal a sponge, which collects cells from the lining of the oesophagus when it is retrieved. These cells then undergo laboratory analysis for biomarkers that indicate the presence of intestinal metaplasia and progression towards cancer demarcated by abnormalities of the p53 gene and dysplasia, with alternative molecular tests including methylation undergoing evaluation. The capsule sponge has a substantial evidence base and is now endorsed by some society guidelines for the diagnosis of BO, with trials ongoing to evaluate its use for proactive screening and BO monitoring. In 2021 and 2022, researchers used a mobile clinic with the aim of offering the test to 1500 people in three demographically distinct locations in the East of England. In this trial, the capsule sponge test was offered to people with a history of acid reflux in particular age brackets who were deemed to be at an increased risk of BO and OAC.

Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. Hypomagnesemia may lead to hypocalcemia and/or hypokalemia and may exacerbate underlying hypocalcemia in at-risk patients. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.

For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Consider monitoring magnesium and calcium levels prior to initiation of Pantoprazole and periodically while on treatment in patients with a preexisting risk of hypocalcemia (e.g., hypoparathyroidism). Supplement with magnesium and/or calcium as necessary. If hypocalcemia is refractory to treatment, consider discontinuing the PPI.

5.9 Tumorigenicity

Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of Pantoprazole. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

5.10 Fundic Gland Polyps

PPI use is associated with an increased risk of fundic gland polyps that increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year. Most PPI users who developed fundic gland polyps were asymptomatic and fundic gland polyps were identified incidentally on endoscopy. Use the shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.

5.11 Interference with Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors

Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Healthcare providers should temporarily stop Pantoprazole treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g., for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

### An official ATS / AASM / ACCP / ERS workshop report: research priorities in ambulatory management of adults with obstructive sleep apnea [^111vgrgE]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2011). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) ambulatory diagnosis — patient selection and role of portable monitors are outlined with emphasis on Type 3 devices and follow-up testing. In most current clinical applications, Type 3 portable monitors are used for unattended home recordings to diagnose OSA, and It is recommended that those patients with a negative Type 3 recording have an in-laboratory PSG to exclude the possibility of a false negative study. Limiting portable monitor testing to patients with a high-likelihood of OSA would minimize the number of negative studies and the need for in-laboratory PSG, and clinical prediction rules such as the Multivariable Apnea Prediction Index, Sleep Apnea Clinical Score, and Berlin Questionnaire have been used for this purpose but have not been adequately tested in clinical management pathways. Very few published studies have assessed specific populations including diverse ethnic groups, the elderly, and individuals with cardio-respiratory and neurological diseases, and persons with COPD, asthma, heart failure, and neuromuscular disorders have a higher risk of developing sleep-related hypoventilation and central sleep apnea, highlighting the need for targeted research in these groups.

### Functional lumen imaging probe for the management of esophageal disorders: expert review from the clinical practice updates committee of the AGA institute [^115tfJD1]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Functional lumen imaging probe (FLIP) methodology and technical aspects describe a catheter-based system with a 240-mm long, 3-mm outer diameter catheter containing 16 paired impedance planimetry electrodes within an infinitely compliant balloon filled with conductive fluid from an 80-mL syringe. Multiple device sizes are commercially available with FLIP measurement segments of 6.0–16 cm, and electrode spacing varies ranging from 4 mm to 1 cm. A solid-state pressure transducer is located at the distal end of the bag enabling simultaneous measurement of pressure and assessment of distensibility of the esophageal body and/or EGJ. The FLIP is placed into the esophagus either transorally or transnasally in a sedated or awake patient; most protocols are performed orally during conscious sedation or under general anesthesia, and positioning uses the real-time, 3-dimensional display at a low fill volume, typically 20–30 mL. The FLIP is indicated (and Food and Drug Administration–approved for use in the United States) for clinical use as a pressure and dimension measurement device.

Leucoselect Phytosome for Neoadjuvant Treatment of Early Stage Lung CancerClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview The investigators will conduct a phase IIa, single arm study using 2–3 weeks of oral LP treatment for 30 early stage I and II lung cancer patients before surgical resection of their tumors. Screening: Patients who have suspected early stage lung cancer will be recruited from Pulmonary and Thoracic Surgery clinics prior to diagnostic biopsy. Intervention: If stage I or II lung cancer is diagnosed from standard clinical practice, the qualified subject will be enrolled into the intervention study to receive 2–3 weeks of LP, taken by mouth once a day, until the lung cancer surgery. At the time of surgery, serial clinical samples, including bronchoscopic and various surgically resected tissues, blood and urine will be collected as post-treatment samples.

Pre- and post-treatment samples will be compared to assess how well oral LP has been absorbed, and whether or not there are encouraging anti-cancer changes occurring in the cells and molecules in response to the LP treatment. Once enrolled for intervention, all subjects will be monitored with weekly phone follow up, the safety of LP will be monitored weekly using standard reporting tools, as well as pre-surgery H&P and blood tests.
