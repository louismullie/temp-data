## Question

An elderly married couple was shopping in a crowded retail store. The husband was several feet ahead of his wife when she saw him slip and lose his balance. He was able to prevent a fall by holding onto a counter. Wife saw something sticky on a wide part of the floor but became disoriented by seeing her husband slipping and gripping the counter. With other shoppers behind her, she stepped forward and fell on the wet floor, breaking her hip, and requiring extensive complicated surgeries. She sued the store for negligent maintenance. She proved through discovery that the retailer did not clean the mess soon enough and did not put up a warning sign. The store filed a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Fed.R. Civ.P. 56, alleging that the wife voluntarily assumed the risk as a matter of law. The trial court agreed, ruling there was no issue of material fact in dispute for the jury to decide. On appeal, is it likely that the appellate court will reverse and remand for a new trial?

Answer Choices:
A. No, because wife proceeded to encounter a known danger voluntarily, thereby assuming the risk of injury as a matter of law and there were no material issues of fact for a jury to decide.
B. No, because even taking the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party under Rule 56, it is nonetheless clear that she knew there was a danger and she accepted the risk.
C. Yes, because there is evidence that raises a material issue of fact whether the wife was in an emergency where she did not have time to deliberate on whether to move forward.
D. Yes, because the store was strictly liable to the wife, who was a customer invited on the premises to do business and the store had to protect her.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether the appellate court will likely reverse the trial court's grant of summary judgment based on voluntary assumption of risk, and remand for a new trial. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the standard of review for summary judgment and how the facts are viewed on appeal. Then, I should verify the elements of voluntary assumption of risk and whether they are genuinely disputed here. Next, I will consider the emergency doctrine and whether it applies to negate assumption of risk. After that, I need to check whether the store's duty of care and notice create separate issues that preclude summary judgment. Finally, I will weigh the competing arguments and predict the most likely appellate outcome with reasoning grounded in tort principles and procedural standards.

> Let me first confirm the standard of review. On appeal from summary judgment, the appellate court reviews de novo, viewing all facts and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, here the plaintiff wife, and asks whether there is any genuine dispute of material fact such that a jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff, which would require reversal and remand.

> I need to verify the elements of voluntary assumption of risk. Traditionally, the defense requires that the plaintiff knew of the specific risk, appreciated its nature, and voluntarily encountered it. If any of those elements are genuinely disputed, summary judgment is inappropriate and the case should go to a jury, so I should scrutinize whether the wife truly had time to deliberate and whether her advance was voluntary under the circumstances.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. The facts suggest the wife saw her husband slip and grip the counter, became disoriented, and was pressured by shoppers behind her to step forward, which raises a credible argument that she did not have a meaningful opportunity to deliberate and that her movement was not purely voluntary, so there is a material factual dispute about whether she assumed the risk as a matter of law.

> Let me consider the emergency doctrine. When a person is confronted with a sudden peril and must act instinctively without time for deliberation, the law does not treat that as voluntary assumption of risk, and here the sudden sight of her husband's near-fall, coupled with crowding and the immediate hazard, plausibly constitutes such an emergency, making the assumption-of-risk defense inappropriate at the summary judgment stage.

> Next, I should review the store's duty and notice. The store had actual or constructive notice of the hazard and failed to clean or warn, which establishes a prima facie breach of its duty of reasonable care to invitees; even if comparative fault is later considered, that breach alone creates a separate material issue of fact that should survive summary judgment and be weighed by a jury alongside any alleged contributory conduct.

> But wait, what if the store argues that merely seeing the hazard equals knowledge and acceptance? I should double-check that assumption. Knowledge alone is insufficient; the plaintiff must also have a realistic opportunity to avoid the risk, and here the combination of disorientation, crowding, and the suddenness of the situation makes it reasonable for a jury to conclude she did not truly accept the risk, which is precisely why summary judgment should be reversed.

> I will now examine the answer choices carefully. Options A and B assert that assumption of risk applies as a matter of law, but they ignore the emergency doctrine and the disputed voluntariness, so they are too categorical and inconsistent with the need to view facts in the plaintiff's favor on appeal, making them incorrect here. Option D claims strict liability, but premises liability for invitees is governed by negligence, not strict liability, so D is legally inaccurate despite the store's breach of duty, which leaves C as the best answer.

> Conclusion: Yes, the appellate court is likely to reverse and remand for a new trial because there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the wife voluntarily assumed the risk, given the emergency circumstances and the lack of a meaningful opportunity to deliberate, and because the store's breach of duty presents a separate issue for the jury to resolve, so the correct choice is C.

---

The appellate court is likely to **reverse and remand** because there is a genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether the wife voluntarily assumed the risk. The emergency doctrine may apply given her disorientation and the pressure of other shoppers, making it improper to grant summary judgment on assumption of risk. The store's negligence in failing to clean or warn is established, but the key issue is whether the wife had a reasonable alternative, which a jury should decide.

---

## Legal standard for summary judgment

Summary judgment is appropriate only when there is **no genuine dispute of material fact** and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and if any material fact is disputed, summary judgment should be denied [^notfound].

---

## Elements of assumption of risk

Assumption of risk requires the defendant to prove that the plaintiff:

- **Knew of the risk**: Had actual knowledge of the specific danger.
- **Appreciated the risk**: Understood the magnitude and nature of the risk.
- **Voluntarily encountered the risk**: Chose to proceed despite the known risk.

If any element is disputed, summary judgment is inappropriate [^notfound].

---

## Application to the facts

### Knowledge and appreciation of risk

The wife saw her husband slip and noticed something sticky on the floor, indicating she **knew of the hazard**. However, her disorientation and the pressure of other shoppers behind her raise a factual question about whether she truly appreciated the risk and had time to deliberate before stepping forward [^notfound].

---

### Voluntariness

The wife's advance occurred while she was disoriented and under pressure from other shoppers, suggesting her action may not have been **truly voluntary**. The emergency doctrine may apply when a person acts instinctively due to sudden peril, negating voluntariness and defeating assumption of risk [^notfound].

---

## Store's negligence

The store's failure to clean the spill or post warnings establishes **negligence**, but this does not automatically negate assumption of risk. The issue is whether the wife's conduct, under the circumstances, constitutes voluntary assumption of risk, which is a factual question for the jury [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The appellate court should **reverse and remand** because there is a genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether the wife voluntarily assumed the risk. The emergency doctrine and the circumstances of her disorientation and pressure from other shoppers make it improper to grant summary judgment. A jury should determine whether she had a reasonable alternative and whether her conduct constituted voluntary assumption of risk [^notfound].

---

The correct answer is **C. Yes, because there is evidence that raises a material issue of fact whether the wife was in an emergency where she did not have time to deliberate on whether to move forward**.

### Subdural hematomas and medical malpractice in the USA: an analysis of 314 patients [^111HPn72]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Although medical defendants were found to be more likely to have a favorable outcome among cases that went to jury trial, settlements proved to be less costly than jury verdicts. Multiple prior reports have also demonstrated the financial benefits that may occur with settling a medical malpractice case. Although the cause of this has not been fully elucidated, it can be theorized that the risk of losing a case to a jury verdict can influence plaintiffs to pursue an agreement that guarantees a payment offer. Therefore, in cases where medical defendants have weak evidence to disprove any negligent care, it may be preferred to settle the case prior to court trial.

Limitations

There are several limitations to address in this study. One such limitation is that certain cases within the Westlaw database may not provide a fully detailed and comprehensive description of the clinical details and relevant medical information of each case. This may be due to the fact that data are uploaded to the system via legal representatives and court judges rather than by medical professionals. Additionally, Westlaw may not include all litigation cases pertaining to SDH, such as those settled outside of the legal system. Settlement cases and claims may also be underreported in Westlaw, particularly by Defense counsel, as they may be less inclined to submit this information out of concern for potentially subjecting their clients to future malpractice cases or setting a standard for future litigation.

Explanation

Disclosure of authors' conflicts of interest provides important context for readers of a trial report when ascertaining the overall methodological rigor of a trial (eg, relevance of the type of comparator intervention and eligibility criteria for patients) and risk of bias (eg, selective reporting of favourable results). Conflicts of interest of all trial manuscript authors should be reported, along with any procedures to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest influencing the trial's design, conduct, analysis, or reporting.

Conflicts of interest can be defined as "a set of circumstances that creates a risk that professional judgement or actions regarding a primary interest will be unduly influenced by a secondary interest". In the context of authors of a trial report, conflicts of interest imply a risk that investigators' personal interests and allegiances, or ties with companies or organisations, have undue influence on the design, conduct, analysis, or reporting of a trial. The concept implies a risk of influence and is not indicative of actual wrongdoing.

Conflicts of interest are most often associated with the drug and device industries. Types of financial ties include salary support or grants; ownership of stock or options; honorariums (eg, for advice, authorship, or public speaking); paid consultancy or service on advisory boards and medical education companies; and receipt of patents or patents pending. An analysis of 200 trials from 2015 reported that 57% of trials had at least one author declaring financial conflicts of interests.

Conflicts of interest may also exist with support from or affiliation with government agencies, charities, and professional and civic organisations. Non-financial conflicts of interest include academic commitments; personal or professional relationships; and political, religious, or other affiliations with special interests or advocacy positions. An analysis of 200 trials found that 4% of trials had at least one author declaring non-financial conflicts of interest. There is ongoing discussion on the association between a problematic non-financial conflict of interest and a reasonable point of view.

### Learning (not) to know: examining how white ignorance manifests and functions in white adolescents' racial identity narratives [^111xxMbr]. Child Development (2025). Medium credibility.

This type of narrative was also reflected in Will's interview, who, in response to the same question, said: "Uh, you know, I mean we [white people] get kinda blamed for everything". When asked whether he has ever experienced being "blamed", he responds: "No, I mean, I've heard other people who might have been, you know". Both Andrew and Will's narratives (and more broadly in the data) showcase how white ignorance does not necessarily require concrete evidence to substantiate its claims ("I mean, I've heard other people who might have been"). This is especially relevant for adolescent development: a white racial identity that is crafted through the lessons of white ignorance positions white youth to construct a distorted reality about race and racism. And importantly, it is the macrocontext of white supremacy that supplies and validates white adolescents' claims of "reverse racism" (e.g. the news, social media sources, the 2023 US Supreme Court's reversal of affirmative action, etc.) because the maintenance of an unjust racial system requires and depends on white youth learning to "see the world wrongly" — that is, as unfair and prejudiced toward white people (Mills).

### Rethinking noninferiority [^115TWBhj]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The practical and ethical rationale for continued randomization

One could argue that the efficacy of a new therapy should be fully established before it is introduced into clinical practice. However, achieving this preapproval would require RCTs that are prohibitively large and costly, making it unfeasible for many companies. As demonstrated by our analysis of stent RCTs, the NI margins currently in use are much wider than what would be ideal, highlighting the need for continued evaluation after approval.

Unlike in superiority trials, where further randomization may become ethically questionable once a new treatment is proven to be more effective than its comparator, equipoise persists in NI trials because the new therapy has only been shown to be no worse than the standard within a predefined margin. This persistent equipoise allows for continued randomization, which is particularly relevant for therapies that do not offer substantial clinical advantages (such as better safety profile) over existing treatments.

By adopting a stepwise approval process for NI, regulatory agencies would foster a more rigorous approach to NI assessment, maintaining the feasibility of premarket clinical trials while ensuring patient safety by requiring further evidence before granting definitive approval to therapies with uncertain efficacy.

### A new legal standard for medical malpractice [^1122Cz2Q]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Patients in the US have persistent needs for safe, evidence-based care. Physicians in the US report fear of liability risk and the need to practice "defensive medicine". In 2024, the American Law Institute revised the legal standard for assessing medical negligence. Understanding the implications of this change is crucial for balancing patient safety, physician autonomy, and the legal system's role in health care.

Observations

The updated standard from the American Law Institute shifts away from the traditional reliance on customary practice toward a more patient-centered concept of reasonable medical care. Although this revised standard still includes elements of prevailing medical practice, it defines reasonable care as the skill and knowledge regarded as competent among similar medical clinicians under comparable circumstances and acknowledges that, in some cases, juries can override customary practices if they fall short of contemporary standards. The restatement also embraces evidence-based practice guidelines, while leaving questions open about the variations in the quality of those guidelines. The restatement makes additional recommendations regarding informed consent and other aspects of physician-patient communication.

Conclusions and Relevance

The new standard of care from the American Law Institute represents a shift away from strict reliance on medical custom and invites courts to incorporate evidence-based medicine into malpractice law. Although states may adopt the recommendations from the American Law Institute at different times and to varying degrees, the restatement offers health professionals and the organizations in which they practice an opportunity to reconsider how medical negligence will be assessed, and to focus more directly on promoting patient safety and improving care delivery. Nonetheless, physicians should recognize that, at least for now, many courts will continue to rely significantly on prevailing practice in assessing medical liability.

### Disclosure of adverse events in pediatrics: policy statement [^115v6fRv]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Legal risks and outcomes — patients and caregivers most often desire complete disclosure of adverse events (AEs), yet historically, lawyers advised their physician-clients not to disclose medical errors (MEs) because apologies might be used in lawsuits and physicians were trained that admitting fault would increase the risk of being sued; however, studies suggest that affected patients and families may be less likely to pursue litigation if such disclosure is provided, lack of such communication may erode trust, and the preponderance of the data, as well as the guiding ethical principles, support prompt and accurate disclosure, with patients and families expecting information about the error, sincere remorse, and a pledge of improvement. Numerous states have passed "apology laws" that protect apologies from being used in court, and as of 2022, 39 states and the District of Columbia have such statutes, with most protecting only sympathetic statements while 9 states also protect statements of fault. Several states have developed "candor laws", and under the Colorado Candor Act discussions and offers of compensation in the process are privileged and confidential, meaning they cannot be used against clinicians if the injured party later decides to file a lawsuit. A Tennessee case decided in 2022, in which a nurse was convicted of negligent homicide after a medication error and her words to state investigators were used against her in court, has raised concerns that workers will be hesitant to disclose errors, and although this type of legal case is extremely rare, the potential deterring effect on self-reporting could undermine the disclosure of AEs and reverse gains in establishing a culture of safety.

### Malpractice litigation related to management of varicocele: a legal database review [^112zBaKN]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Urologists should also take the opportunity to engage in patient education surrounding expectations for varicocele management. Cohen v. Cabrini Medical Center, for example, highlights this importance: the plaintiff, who was the wife of the patient who underwent a varicocelectomy, had assumed that her husband's operation would result in increased fertility and assure pregnancy. She was never given these assurances, and so her case was dismissed as being too speculative. Although surgery can certainly improve fertility rates, patients should be educated that it does not guarantee pregnancy. Likewise, urologists should also remind patients that surgery does not guarantee pain alleviation, the lack of which led to cases such as Abdur-Rahiim v. Doe and Diaz v. Spencer.

Our study does come with limitations. It does not capture cases which settled prior to trial, and so may give an incomplete picture of litigation procedures surrounding varicocele management. Likewise, although Casetext can provide a comprehensive overview of legal cases, different jurisdictions have different reporting requirements. This can result in inconsistent and incomplete data from the cases. Lastly, the Casetext database is concerned with legal matters and does not necessarily provide a complete medical context with which to analyze each case. As such, we were not privy to the medical documents and patient reports which were cited in the cases.

Nonetheless, providers should be reassured that malpractice cases regarding varicoceles are uncommon and that most cases are ruled in favor of the defense. Moreover, it is important that the context and details of legal cases surrounding urologists are examined and shared to improve patient care and guide urologists in managing varicoceles.

### Rethinking noninferiority [^111YnLJF]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

A Bayesian approach provides a natural statistical foundation for this process by enabling the sequential updating of treatment effect estimates as new data emerge. Instead of treating each RCT as an independent entity, the posterior distribution from one study would inform the prior for subsequent analyses, allowing for a more continuous and evidence-driven reassessment of NI.

As an alternative to using a permissive NI margin for initial approval and a more stringent NI margin for definitive approval, a single stringent NI margin could be used from the outset while varying the probability criterion at the different approval stages. Under this approach, initial approval could require a more permissive probability threshold, such as a 75% probability that the true treatment effect does not exceed the NI margin, whereas the final approval could require a 95% probability (Figure 1, right panel). While this approach deviates more from current regulatory practice, it is arguably more scientifically sound, as it ensures that the NI margin is clinically meaningful throughout the approval process.

### Rethinking noninferiority [^116hgyRQ]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

A stepwise approach to noninferiority assessment

A more adaptive and iterative regulatory framework would better balance the needs for innovation and timely introduction of new therapies with the requirement for robust clinical evidence. Instead of making a definitive decision based on a single NI RCT, the assessment of a new therapy's efficacy could follow a stepwise process, in which the treatment effect estimate is continuously refined through ongoing RCTs that continue after initial approval.

In this framework, an initial pivotal NI RCT would use a relatively permissive NI margin (as is currently the case), allowing the therapy to enter clinical practice while acknowledging residual uncertainty regarding its efficacy relative to the standard of care. However, approval at this stage would not be taken to indicate that the treatment's comparative effectiveness is fully established. Instead, subsequent RCT data would be required to incrementally improve certainty, progressively narrowing the NI margin as more evidence accumulates (Figure 1, left panel). These data could be acquired by continuing to randomize patients beyond the initial cohort intended as the analysis cohort for initial approval within the same RCT framework, or by conducting additional RCTs in parallel with the introduction of the therapy in clinical practice. Regulatory authorities could impose a time limit for when additional data would be required, and the more stringent NI margin should be met. This approach ensures that residual uncertainty is addressed while allowing promising therapies to be adopted sooner.

Figure 1
Proposed Stepwise Approach to Definitive Approval of New Therapies Introduced Via Noninferiority Trials

(Left) In the initial study cohort, a preliminary noninferiority assessment is conducted using a permissive NI margin (A), for example, requiring at least 95% probability that the true effect falls within this margin. Meeting this threshold grants conditional approval, with continued trials assessing a stricter NI margin (B) within a set time frame. Since the therapy is already on the market, the financial burden is lower than requiring a stringent margin upfront. If it fails step B, it is withdrawn; if successful, it must ultimately meet a clinically insignificant NI margin for full approval. (Right) Alternatively, a strict NI margin could be set from the start, with lower probability requirements for initial versus definitive approval. The right panel shows more probability mass extending beyond the NI margin at the initial stage (A) than at the definitive stage (C). NI = noninferiority; PDF = probability density function; TE = treatment effect.

### The number of patients lost to follow-up may exceed the fragility index of a randomized controlled trial without reversing statistical significance: a systematic review and statistical model [^114oxeT1]. Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To (1) analyze trends in the publishing of statistical fragility index (FI)-based systematic reviews in the orthopaedic literature, including the prevalence of misleading or inaccurate statements related to the statistical fragility of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and patients lost to follow-up (LTF), and (2) determine whether RCTs with relatively "low" FIs are truly as sensitive to patients LTF as previously portrayed in the literature.

Methods

All FI-based studies published in the orthopaedic literature were identified using the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science Core Collection, PubMed, and MEDLINE databases. All articles involving application of the FI or reverse FI to study the statistical fragility of studies in orthopaedics were eligible for inclusion in the study. Study characteristics, median FIs and sample sizes, and misleading or inaccurate statements related to the FI and patients LTF were recorded. Misleading or inaccurate statements-defined as those basing conclusions of trial fragility on the false assumption that adding patients LTF back to a trial has the same statistical effect as existing patients in a trial experiencing the opposite outcome-were determined by 2 authors. A theoretical RCT with a sample size of 100, P = 0.006, and FI of 4 was used to evaluate the difference in effect on statistical significance between flipping outcome events of patients already included in the trial (FI) and adding patients LTF back to the trial to show the true sensitivity of RCTs to patients LTF.

Results

Of the 39 FI-based studies, 37 (95%) directly compared the FI with the number of patients LTF. Of these 37 studies, 22 (59%) included a statement regarding the FI and patients LTF that was determined to be inaccurate or misleading. In the theoretical RCT, a reversal of significance was not observed until 7 patients LTF (nearly twice the FI) were added to the trial in the distribution of maximal significance reversal.

Conclusions

The claim that any RCT in which the number of patients LTF exceeds the FI could potentially have its significance reversed simply by maintaining study follow-ups is commonly inaccurate and prevalent in orthopaedic studies applying the FI. Patients LTF and the FI are not equivalent. The minimum number of patients LTF required to flip the significance of a typical RCT was shown to be greater than the FI, suggesting that RCTs with relatively low FIs may not be as sensitive to patients LTF as previously portrayed in the literature; however, only a holistic approach that considers the context in which the trial was conducted, potential biases, and study results can determine the merits of any particular RCT.

Clinical Relevance

Surgeons may benefit from re-examining their interpretation of prior FI reviews that have made claims of substantial RCT fragility based on comparisons between the FI and patients LTF; it is possible the results are more robust than previously believed.

### Methadone (methadone hydrochloride) [^117B5Vi6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Conditions for Distribution and Use of Methadone Products for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction

Code of Federal Regulations, Title 42, Sec 8: Methadone products when used for the treatment of opioid addiction in detoxification or maintenance programs, shall be dispensed only by opioid treatment programs (and agencies, practitioners or institutions by formal agreement with the program sponsor) certified by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and approved by the designated state authority. Certified treatment programs shall dispense and use methadone in oral form only and according to the treatment requirements stipulated in the Federal Opioid Treatment Standards (42 CFR 8.12). See below for important regulatory exceptions to the general requirement for certification to provide opioid agonist treatment.

Failure to abide by the requirements in these regulations may result in criminal prosecution, seizure of the drug supply, revocation of the program approval, and injunction precluding operation of the program.

Regulatory Exceptions to the General Requirement for Certification to Provide Opioid Agonist Treatment:

During inpatient care, when the patient was admitted for any condition other than concurrent opioid addiction (pursuant to 21 CFR 1306.07(c)), to facilitate the treatment of the primary admitting diagnosis).
During an emergency period of no longer than 3 days while definitive care for the addiction is being sought in an appropriately licensed facility (pursuant to 21 CFR 1306.07(b)).

2.2
Important General Information

The peak respiratory depressant effect of methadone occurs later and persists longer than its peak therapeutic effect.
A high degree of opioid tolerance does not eliminate the possibility of methadone overdose, iatrogenic or otherwise. Deaths have been reported during conversion to methadone from chronic, high-dose treatment with other opioid agonists and during initiation of methadone treatment of addiction in subjects previously abusing high doses of other agonists.
With repeated dosing, methadone is retained in the liver and then slowly released, prolonging the duration of potential toxicity.
Methadone has a narrow therapeutic index, especially when combined with other drugs.

### Medical malpractice litigation trends following primary total hip and knee joint arthroplasty: an updated nationwide analysis [^115uWSbB]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is the most common procedure associated with malpractice claims within orthopaedic surgery. Although prior research has assessed prevalent causes and outcomes of TJA-related lawsuits before 2018, the dynamic healthcare environment demands regular re-evaluations. This study aimed to provide an updated analysis of the predominant causes and outcomes of TJA-related malpractice lawsuits and analyze the outcomes of subsequent appeals following initial jury verdicts.

Methods

A legal database was queried for cases between 2018 and 2022 involving primary hip and knee TJA in the United States. Cases were listed as original rulings or appeals and reviewed for the alleged negligence, damages incurred, demographics, and verdicts. Appeals were further assessed for appellant details, preliminary judgment, and outcomes. The findings were compared to previous litigation data using descriptive statistics.

Results

The final cohort comprised 59 cases: 33 (56%) total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and 26 (44%) total hip arthroplasty (THA). The TKA cases primarily cited pain (24%), while the THA cases cited nerve injuries (31%). Negligence largely stemmed from procedural error (47%), postsurgical error (27%), and failure to inform (14%). Case outcomes were in favor of the defense in 66% of cases. Overall, 90% of primary verdicts led to appeals, with 71% by the plaintiff. Initial rulings were upheld in 87% of plaintiff appeals, whereas 53% of defendant appeals retained the initial judgment.

Conclusions

The primary cause of litigation shifted from infection to ongoing/worsening pain in TKA cases over time. While nerve injury TKA cases have decreased, it remains the most cited damage after THA. Defense verdicts are common, but there is an increasing number of verdicts against defendants. Plaintiffs are more likely to appeal, but are less successful in appellate courts. These findings allow surgeons and policymakers to address emerging litigation trends in TJA to mitigate risks and improve the overall quality of TJA.

While clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) were developed to help improve patient care, they have increasingly been used as evidence in medical malpractice lawsuits. They are used by both sides in malpractice litigation as a surrogate for the standard of care. Providing care compliant with a CPG can be protective for physicians, but it does not completely absolve them of liability. Providing noncompliant care does carry an increased risk of litigation, but there are several defenses that have been successfully used to defend physicians. Effective communication and comprehensive documentation help mitigate the risk incurred by not following a CPG.

5.7 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia

Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see Dependence (9.3)]. Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior.

Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.14)].

5.8 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients

The use of OXAYDO in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.

Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease: OXAYDO-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of OXAYDO [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Regularly evaluate patients, particularly when initiating and titrating OXAYDO and when OXAYDO is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)].

Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.

### Delgocitinib (Anzupgo) [^116Bdhuj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of delgocitinib in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. After oral administration, delgocitinib was present in the milk of lactating rats. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ANZUPGO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ANZUPGO or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

To minimize potential infant exposure, advise breastfeeding women to avoid direct contact with the nipple and surrounding area immediately after applying ANZUPGO to the hands and/or wrists.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and efficacy of ANZUPGO have not been established in pediatric patients.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the 691 subjects exposed to ANZUPGO in clinical trials, 59 subjects (8.5%) were 65 years of age and older and 10 subjects (1.4%) were 75 years of age and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects 65 years of age and older and younger adult subjects.

### The art of clinical negotiation [^112yzqQe]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

The art of clinical negotiation is an important, yet underappreciated aspect of medicine. Key components of negotiation include the need to consider principles over personalities; to explore all options before deciding on the best course; to realize that, if consensus cannot be achieved, then compromise may still be possible; to work from evidence to incorporate contextual factors; and to stay evidence based. These principles can be helpful in many settings, including contract negotiation, drug pricing, and research. Negotiating the balance between patient safety and efficient research methodology is central to discussions with institutional review boards and public and private researchers. When guidelines are developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach, shared decision making and negotiation of treatment plans can be seamlessly incorporated into patient conversations for conditional recommendations, and negotiation skills may facilitate clinical adoption of strong recommendation as well.

---

### Methadone hydrochloride [^112MLjrt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Addiction, Abuse and Misuse

Methadone Hydrochloride Tablets contain methadone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, Methadone Hydrochloride Tablets expose users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse. As long-acting opioids such as Methadone Hydrochloride Tablets have pharmacological effects over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)].

Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed Methadone Hydrochloride Tablets. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. The risk of opioid-related overdose or overdose-related death is increased with higher opioid doses, and this risk persists over the course of therapy. In postmarketing studies, addiction, abuse, misuse, and fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose were observed in patients with long-term opioid use [see Postmarketing Experience (6)].

Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing Methadone Hydrochloride Tablets, and reassess all patients receiving Methadone Hydrochloride Tablets for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as Methadone Hydrochloride Tablets, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of Methadone Hydrochloride Tablets along with frequent reevaluation for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Consider prescribing an opioid overdose reversal agent [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Abuse or misuse of Methadone Hydrochloride Tablets by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the methadone and can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)].

Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing Methadone Hydrochloride Tablets. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on careful storage of the drug during the course of treatment and proper disposal of unused drug. Contact local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.

### Use of clesrovimab for prevention of severe respiratory syncytial virus-associated lower respiratory tract infections in infants: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2025 [^113T8fVV]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for respiratory syncytial virus infection, more specifically with respect to immunization, infants and children, CDC 2025 guidelines recommend to offer clesrovimab as one of two long-acting monoclonal antibody options (as an alternative to nirsevimab), for the protection of infants aged < 8 months born during or entering their first RSV season who are not protected through maternal RSV vaccination. Offer protection against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection all infants through one of three product options:

- maternal RSV vaccination during pregnancy

- infant receipt of the long-acting RSV monoclonal antibody, nirsevimab

- infant receipt of the long-acting RSV monoclonal antibody, clesrovimab.

### Aripiprazole (Abilify) [^113Y34uj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Aripiprazole is present in human breast milk. Based on published case reports and pharmacovigilance reports, aripiprazole exposure during pregnancy and/or the postpartum period may lead to clinically relevant decreases in milk supply which may be reversible with discontinuation of the drug. There are also reports of aripiprazole exposure during pregnancy and no maternal milk supply in the post-partum period. Effects on milk supply may be mediated through decreases in prolactin levels, which have been observed [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor the breastfed infant for dehydration and lack of appropriate weight gain. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ABILIFY and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ABILIFY or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients with major depressive disorder or agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar mania have not been established.

The pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole in pediatric patients, 10 to 17 years of age, were similar to those in adults after correcting for the differences in body weight [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Schizophrenia

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients with schizophrenia were established in a 6-week, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 202 pediatric patients aged 13 to 17 years [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Although maintenance efficacy in pediatric patients has not been systematically evaluated, maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from adult data along with comparisons of aripiprazole pharmacokinetic parameters in adult and pediatric patients.

### Tofacitinib (Xeljanz) [^116fcf6h]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

XELJANZ/XELJANZ Oral Solution

Following oral administration of XELJANZ/XELJANZ Oral Solution, peak plasma concentrations are reached within 0.5–1 hour, elimination half-life is about 3 hours and a dose-proportional increase in systemic exposure was observed in the therapeutic dose range. Steady state concentrations are achieved in 24–48 hours with negligible accumulation after twice daily administration.

XELJANZ XR

Following oral administration of XELJANZ XR, peak plasma concentrations are reached at 4 hours and half-life is about 6 to 8 hours. Steady state concentrations are achieved within 48 hours with negligible accumulation after once daily administration.

Absorption

XELJANZ

The absolute oral bioavailability of XELJANZ is 74%. Coadministration of XELJANZ with a high-fat meal resulted in no changes in AUC while Cmaxwas reduced by 32%. In clinical trials, XELJANZ was administered without regard to meals [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

XELJANZ XR

Coadministration of XELJANZ XR 11 and 22 mg with a high-fat meal resulted in no changes in AUC while Cmaxwas increased by 27% and 19% respectively. Tmaxwas extended by approximately 1 hour for both XELJANZ XR 11 and 22 mg.

Distribution

After intravenous administration, the volume of distribution is 87 L. The protein binding of tofacitinib is approximately 40%. Tofacitinib binds predominantly to albumin and does not appear to bind to α1-acid glycoprotein. Tofacitinib distributes equally between red blood cells and plasma.

Metabolism and Excretion

Clearance mechanisms for tofacitinib are approximately 70% hepatic metabolism and 30% renal excretion of the parent drug. The metabolism of tofacitinib is primarily mediated by CYP3A4 with minor contribution from CYP2C19. In a human radiolabeled study, more than 65% of the total circulating radioactivity was accounted for by unchanged tofacitinib, with the remaining 35% attributed to 8 metabolites, each accounting for less than 8% of total radioactivity. The pharmacologic activity of tofacitinib is attributed to the parent molecule.

Pharmacokinetics in Patient Populations

Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that pharmacokinetic characteristics were similar between patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and UC. The coefficient of variation (%) in AUC of tofacitinib were generally similar across different disease patients, ranging from 22% to 34% (Table 8).

### Darunavir (Prezista) [^115PZaNw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical trials of PREZISTA/ritonavir in treatment-naïve subjects: In the 192-week as-treated analysis censoring those who discontinued before Week 4 of the Phase 3 trial TMC114-C211, the percentage of virologic failures (never suppressed, rebounders and discontinued before achieving suppression) was 22% (64/288) in the group of subjects receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily compared to 29% (76/263) of subjects receiving lopinavir/ritonavir 800/200 mg per day. In the PREZISTA/ritonavir arm, emergent PI resistance-associated substitutions were identified in 11 of the virologic failures with post-baseline genotypic data (n = 43). However, none of the darunavir virologic failures had a decrease in darunavir susceptibility (greater than 7-fold change) at failure. In the comparator lopinavir/ritonavir arm, emergent PI resistance-associated substitutions were identified in 17 of the virologic failures with post-baseline genotypic data (n = 53), but none of the lopinavir/ritonavir virologic failures had decreased susceptibility to lopinavir (greater than 10-fold change) at failure. The reverse transcriptase M184V substitution and/or resistance to emtricitabine, which was included in the fixed background regimen, was identified in 4 virologic failures from the PREZISTA/ritonavir arm and 7 virologic failures in the lopinavir/ritonavir arm.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on management of gastroparesis [^114kdfou]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for gastroparesis, more specifically with respect to prokinetics and antiemetics, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering erythromycin in patients with GP.
Recognize that erythromycin improves symptoms of GP due to its gastric prokinetic effects rather than a direct antiemetic effect. Recognize that erythromycin's effects on symptoms and gastric motility are through its motilin receptor agonist properties and are unrelated to its antibiotic properties. Administer low doses, such as 40–150 mg PO, 30 minutes before meals, to reduce potential adverse effects seen with higher doses, such as 250–500 mg. Use erythromycin ethylsuccinate oral suspension to administer smaller, better-tolerated doses, as erythromycin tablets are only available in high doses. Recognize that tachyphylaxis often develops with prolonged, continuous use of erythromycin; maintain efficacy using drug holidays, such as 3 weeks on therapy, 1 week off therapy. Be aware of safety concerns with erythromycin, including the development of antibiotic resistance with long-term use, drug interactions as it is a CYP3A isoform inhibitor, and QT-prolongation. Consider using azithromycin as a substitute for erythromycin, with similar safety considerations, such as antibiotic resistance.

Studies 1 through 5 included 40 weeks of post-treatment follow-up. In each study, varenicline-treated patients were more likely to maintain abstinence throughout the follow-up period than were patients treated with placebo(Figure 2, Table 8).

Figure 2. Continuous Abstinence, Weeks 9 through 52

Table 8. Continuous Abstinence, Weeks 9 through 52 (95% confidence interval) Across Different Studies

BID = twice daily

Study 6

This study assessed the effect of an additional 12 weeks of varenicline therapy on the likelihood of long-term abstinence. Patients in this study (N = 1927) were treated with open-label varenicline 1 mg twice daily for 12 weeks. Patients who had stopped smoking for at least a week by Week 12 (N = 1210) were then randomized to double-blind treatment with varenicline (1 mg twice daily) or placebo for an additional 12 weeks and then followed for 28 weeks post-treatment.

The continuous abstinence rate from Week 13 through Week 24 was higher for patients continuing treatment with varenicline (70%) than for patients switching to placebo (50%). Superiority to placebo was also maintained during 28 weeks post-treatment follow-up (varenicline 54% versus placebo 39%).

In Figure 3 below, the x-axis represents the study week for each observation, allowing a comparison of groups at similar times after discontinuation of varenicline; post- varenicline follow-up begins at Week 13 for the placebo group and Week 25 for the varenicline group. The y-axis represents the percentage of patients who had been abstinent for the last week of varenicline treatment and remained abstinent at the given time point.

14.4 Alternative Instructions for Setting a Quit Date

Varenicline was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial where patients were instructed to select a target quit date between Day 8 and Day 35 of treatment. Subjects were randomized 3:1 to varenicline 1 mg twice daily (N = 486) or placebo (N = 165) for 12 weeks of treatment and followed for another 12 weeks post-treatment. Patients treated with varenicline had a superior rate of CO-confirmed abstinence during weeks 9 through 12 (54%) compared to patients treated with placebo (19%) and from weeks 9 through 24 (35%) compared to subjects treated with placebo (13%).

### Prasugrel [^115bG4Tm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 General Risk of Bleeding

Thienopyridines, including prasugrel tablets, increase the risk of bleeding. With the dosing regimens used in TRITON-TIMI 38, TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) Major (clinically overt bleeding associated with a fall in hemoglobin ≥ 5 g/dL, or intracranial hemorrhage) and TIMI Minor (overt bleeding associated with a fall in hemoglobin of ≥ 3 g/dL but < 5 g/dL) bleeding events were more common on prasugrel tablets than on clopidogrel [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The bleeding risk is highest initially, as shown in Figure 1 (events through 450 days; inset shows events through 7 days).

Figure 1: Non-CABG-Related TIMI Major or Minor Bleeding Events.

Suspect bleeding in any patient who is hypotensive and has recently undergone coronary angiography, PCI, CABG, or other surgical procedures even if the patient does not have overt signs of bleeding.

Do not use prasugrel tablets in patients with active bleeding, prior TIA or stroke [see Contraindications (4.1, 4.2)].

Other risk factors for bleeding are:

Age ≥ 75 years. Because of the risk of bleeding (including fatal bleeding) and uncertain effectiveness in patients ≥ 75 years of age, use of prasugrel tablets is generally not recommended in these patients, except in high-risk situations (patients with diabetes or history of myocardial infarction) where its effect appears to be greater and its use may be considered [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Trials (14)].
CABG or other surgical procedure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Body weight < 60 kg. Consider a lower (5 mg) maintenance dose [see Dosage and Administration (2), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].
Propensity to bleed (e.g., recent trauma, recent surgery, recent or recurrent gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, active peptic ulcer disease, severe hepatic impairment, or moderate to severe renal impairment) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7, 8.8)].
Medications that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., oral anticoagulants, chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], and fibrinolytic agents). Aspirin and heparin were commonly used in TRITON-TIMI 38 [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2, 7.4), and Clinical Studies (14)].

### Olanzapine [^115bN51x]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of olanzapine IM (also known as Zyprexa, Zyprexa Zydis, Zyprexa):
- **Cognitive difficulties, motor impairment**: use extreme caution in patients performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving or operating machinery.
- **Decreased gastrointestinal motility**: use caution in patients with constipation or a history of paralytic ileus or related conditions.
- **Decreased WBC count, decreased blood neutrophil count, agranulocytosis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as olanzapine has been associated with an increased risk of leukopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis. Monitor CBC frequently during the first few months in patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC or drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Monitor patients with clinically significant neutropenia for fever and other symptoms or signs of infection.
- **DRESS syndrome**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as olanzapine has been associated with an increased risk of DRESS syndrome.
- **Dysphagia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as olanzapine has been associated with an increased risk of esophageal dysmotility and aspiration.
- **Exacerbation of urinary retention**: use caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of urinary retention or clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy.
- **Falls**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as olanzapine can cause somnolence, postural hypotension, and motor and sensory instability, which may result in falls and fractures.
- **Hyperprolactinemia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as long-term use of olanzapine may increase prolactin levels.
- **Impaired thermoregulation**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as antipsychotic agents have been associated with an increased risk of impaired thermoregulation, resulting in a reduced ability to lower core body temperature.
- **Metabolic changes**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as olanzapine has been associated with an increased risk of metabolic changes, including hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain. Obtain fasting blood glucose testing and a lipid profile before initiation and periodically during treatment.
- **Neuroleptic malignant syndrome**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as olanzapine has been associated with an increased risk of neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
- **Orthostatic hypotension**: use caution in patients with known CVD, cerebrovascular disease, conditions predisposing to hypotension, or taking other drugs increasing the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory or CNS depression.
- **Seizure**: use caution in patients with a history of seizure disorder.
- **Suicidal ideation**: use caution in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.
- **Tardive dyskinesia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as olanzapine has been associated with an increased risk of tardive dyskinesia, especially in the elderly.

### Glipizide and metformin hydrochloride [^111nj919]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Glipizide and Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets:

Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of blood glucose control. These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs, and isoniazid. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets, the patient should be closely observed for loss of blood glucose control. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets, the patient should be observed closely for hypoglycemia. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins and is, therefore, less likely to interact with highly protein-bound drugs such as salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, and probenecid as compared to sulfonylureas, which are extensively bound to serum proteins.

### Indomethacin [^113iCacN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as indomethacin, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

14.2 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

The efficacy of ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50 and ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50 in the treatment of subjects with COPD was evaluated in 6 randomized, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trials in adult subjects aged 40 years and older. These trials were primarily designed to evaluate the efficacy of ADVAIR DISKUS on lung function (3 trials), exacerbations (2 trials), and survival (1 trial).

Lung Function

Two (2) of the 3 clinical trials primarily designed to evaluate the efficacy of ADVAIR DISKUS on lung function were conducted in 1,414 subjects with COPD associated with chronic bronchitis. In these 2 trials, all the subjects had a history of cough productive of sputum that was not attributable to another disease process on most days for at least 3 months of the year for at least 2 years. The trials were randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 24-week treatment duration. One (1) trial evaluated the efficacy of ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50 compared with its components fluticasone propionate 250 mcg and salmeterol 50 mcg and with placebo, and the other trial evaluated the efficacy of ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50 compared with its components fluticasone propionate 500 mcg and salmeterol 50 mcg and with placebo. Trial treatments were inhalation powders given as 1 inhalation from the DISKUS inhaler twice daily. Maintenance COPD therapies were discontinued, with the exception of theophylline. The subjects had a mean pre-bronchodilator FEV₁of 41% and 20% reversibility at trial entry. Percent reversibility was calculated as 100 times (FEV₁post-albuterol minus FEV₁pre-albuterol)/FEV₁pre-albuterol.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for extravasation of antineoplastic agents, more specifically with respect to indications for referral, ASCO/ONS 2025 guidelines recommend to consider performing a surgical referral or escalation of care for patients with central line extravasation of irritants with vesicant properties or vesicant antineoplastic agents, in addition to conservative management, rather than conservative management alone.

- recognize that high-risk populations, such as patients receiving DNA-binding vesicants, those with high-volume estimated extravasation, and those with National Cancer Institute CTCAE grade 2 (erythema associated with symptoms such as edema, pain, induration, and phlebitis), grade 3 (ulceration or necrosis; severe tissue damage), or grade 4 (life-threatening consequences) extravasation, may have a greater likelihood of benefiting from surgical referral or escalation in care.

### Falls and older adults… [^116cPi4M]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Falls are the leading cause of deaths related to injury among people 65 years and older. More than one-third will fall each year; two-thirds of those who fall will fall again within 6 months. Although falling is not normal, older people are more likely to fall because of sensory changes, bones that are less dense, slower reflexes, and reduced strength. These changes affect walking and balance. The January 20, 2010, issue of JAMA includes an article about care of older adults who fall. Factors increasing risk of falls Falls have many causes. Common causes include gait and balance problems, neurological and musculoskeletal problems, use of medications affecting balance, impaired thinking and memory, impaired vision, and environmental hazards.

Additionally, many older adults fail to exercise regularly, resulting in poor muscle tone, decreased strength, and loss of bone mass and flexibility, which make it easier to fall. Medical care If you do fall, you should be seen by a doctor. The American Geriatrics Society recommends that any fall needs evaluation. Head injuries may not cause symptoms right away and are especially important to evaluate promptly. Prevention. Recommendations for fall prevention focus on 4 areas. First, all older adults should participate in regular exercise to improve balance and strength. One useful activity is tai chi, which increases flexibility, posture, and strength. Second, all older adults should review their medications with their physician. Third, poor vision is linked to falling; all older adults should have regular vision checkups. Finally, the CDC has published a checklist to "fall-proof" your home. A short version of this list includes. Remove rugs or firmly fasten them to the floor.

Move furniture so the path is clear. Clear the floor of electrical wires by coiling them, or add another outlet. Keep areas well lit, adding lights in dark places and keeping bulbs changed; put a night-light in the hallway so that a path from your bed to the bathroom is lit. Place working handrails on both sides of stairs and grab bars next to the toilet or inside the bathtub. Move items on high shelves to cabinets. Those used most often should be stored at about waist level. Get up slowly after sitting or lying down. Wear shoes with firm nonskid soles; avoid wearing loose-fitting slippers. Use appropriate equipment for added stability.

### Using the recommended summary plan for emergency care and treatment (ReSPECT) in a community setting: does it facilitate best interests decision-making? [^113FSyKK]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2025). Medium credibility.

Moreover, as with other anticipatory decision-making models, ReSPECT recommendations cannot anticipate every possible emergency scenario, meaning that recommendations must be subject to interpretation during an emergency. For some clinicians, ReSPECT recommendations contribute to the best interests decision-making process but do not have to be followed, while others view ReSPECT recommendations as determinative within the best interests assessment. This can lead to conflict between carers and clinicians, and potential harm to patients. Additionally, our finding that patient and relative participants expect ReSPECT recommendations will be followed in all situations demonstrates a gap between patient/relative expectations and clinical practice. Clinicians should make patients and relatives aware that ReSPECT guides, but does not prescribe, clinical decision-making.

The uncertainty and inconsistency in the interpretation of ReSPECT recommendations identified in our study reflects diverging concepts of best interests as synonymous with, informed by or distinct from preferences. Broadly speaking, in clinical practice, best interests is conceptualised as reflecting and informed by the patient's values/wishes/preferences, but not determined exclusively by patient preferences. Recent cases in the UK Court of Protection suggest increasing prioritisation of the person's wishes and preferences in best interests decisions, giving greater weight to individual autonomy. However, understanding previously expressed wishes for particular treatments in specific emergency situations is challenging, given the uncertainty of many illness trajectories. To respect the patient's autonomy, an understanding of who they are as a person and what is important to them may be more meaningful.

### Tamoxifen citrate [^115p6oqj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Reduction in Breast Cancer Incidence in High Risk Women:

Tamoxifen citrate tablets are indicated to reduce the incidence of breast cancer in women at high risk for breast cancer. This effect was shown in a study of 5 years planned duration with a median follow-up of 4.2 years. Twenty-five percent of the participants received drug for 5 years. The longer-term effects are not known. In this study, there was no impact of tamoxifen on overall or breast cancer-related mortality (see BOXED WARNING at the beginning of the label).

Tamoxifen citrate tablets are indicated only for high-risk women. "High risk" is defined as women at least 35 years of age with a 5-year predicted risk of breast cancer ≥ 1.67%, as calculated by the Gail Model.

Examples of combinations of factors predicting a 5-year risk ≥ 1.67% are:

Age 35 or older and any of the following combination of factors:

One first degree relative with a history of breast cancer, 2 or more benign biopsies, and a history of a breast biopsy showing atypical hyperplasia; or
At least 2 first degree relatives with a history of breast cancer, and a personal history of at least one breast biopsy; or
LCIS

Age 40 or older and any of the following combination of factors:

One first degree relative with a history of breast cancer, 2 or more benign biopsies, age at first live birth 25 or older, and age at menarche 11 or younger; or
At least 2 first degree relatives with a history of breast cancer, and age at first live birth 19 or younger; or
One first degree relative with a history of breast cancer, and a personal history of a breast biopsy showing atypical hyperplasia.

### Presence and origin of variability of the pull test and push-and-release test in people with Parkinson's disease [^114MTFpm]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Example of a pseudo-randomized trial sequence for a participant. The first trial was always a treadmill perturbation at 1.5 m/s². PRT: Push & release test

The pull test was conducted according to the instructions of the MDS-UPDRS part III, item 12. Before each pull test, the participants were instructed to stand upright with their feet comfortably wide and parallel next to each other. In addition, the person was allowed to take a step backward to prevent a fall. The assessors executed the pull test by applying a quick and forceful pull to the shoulders, forceful enough to displace the center of mass so that at least one step was needed to prevent a fall. Pull test trials were rated offline using the video-data and according to the ordinal scale of the MDS-UPDRS part III item 12, i.e. (0) recovery with one or two steps; (1) three to five steps, but participant recovers unaided, (2) more than five steps but participant recovers unaided, (3) stands safely, but with absence of postural response; falls if not caught by assessor, (4) very unstable, tends to lose balance spontaneously or with just a gentle pull on the shoulders. The last did not occur in our study, as one of our inclusion criteria would interfere. Whenever a participant utilized the safety bars or used multiple steps but failed to recover balance before reaching the end of the treadmill surface and stepped into an assessor, the trial received a rating of 3.

### Darunavir [^114Z6DDi]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In trial TMC114-C214, the 7 darunavir/ritonavir virologic failures with reduced susceptibility to darunavir at failure were also resistant to the approved PIs (fos) amprenavir, atazanavir, lopinavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir at failure. Six of these 7 were resistant to saquinavir and 5 were resistant to tipranavir. Four of these virologic failures were already PI-resistant at baseline.

Cross-resistance between darunavir and nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, fusion inhibitors, CCR5 co-receptor antagonists, or integrase inhibitors is unlikely because the viral targets are different.

 Baseline Genotype/Phenotype and Virologic Outcome Analyses

Genotypic and/or phenotypic analysis of baseline virus may aid in determining darunavir susceptibility before initiation of darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily therapy. The effect of baseline genotype and phenotype on virologic response at 96 weeks was analyzed in as-treated analyses using pooled data from the Phase 2b trials (Trials TMC114-C213, TMC114-C202, and TMC114-C215) (n = 439). The findings were confirmed with additional genotypic and phenotypic data from the control arms of etravirine trials TMC125-C206 and TMC125-C216 at Week 24 (n = 591).

### Darunavir (darunavir 600 and 800 mg) [^1147rGhV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In trial TMC114-C214, the 7 darunavir/ritonavir virologic failures with reduced susceptibility to darunavir at failure were also resistant to the approved PIs (fos)-amprenavir, atazanavir, lopinavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir at failure. Six of these 7 were resistant to saquinavir and 5 were resistant to tipranavir. Four of these virologic failures were already PI-resistant at baseline.

Cross-resistance between darunavir and nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, fusion inhibitors, CCR5 co-receptor antagonists, or integrase inhibitors is unlikely because the viral targets are different.

Baseline Genotype/Phenotype and Virologic Outcome Analyses

Genotypic and/or phenotypic analysis of baseline virus may aid in determining darunavir susceptibility before initiation of darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily therapy. The effect of baseline genotype and phenotype on virologic response at 96 weeks was analyzed in as-treated analyses using pooled data from the Phase 2b trials (Trials TMC114-C213, TMC114-C202, and TMC114-C215) (n = 439). The findings were confirmed with additional genotypic and phenotypic data from the control arms of etravirine trials TMC125-C206 and TMC125-C216 at Week 24 (n = 591).

### Insulin glargine and lixisenatide (Soliqua 100 / 33) [^113EK6F9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

After holding and slowly counting to 10, release the injection button. Then remove the needle from your skin.

If you find it hard to press the injection button in:

Change the needle (see Step 6 to remove the needle and Step 2 to attach a new needle) then do a safety test (see Step 3).
If you still find it hard to press in, get a new pen.
Do not use a syringe to remove medicine from your pen.

Step 6: Remove the needle

Take care when handling needles to prevent needle-stick injury and cross-infection.
Do not put the inner needle cap back on.

Grip the widest part of the outer needle cap. Keep the needle straight and guide it into the outer needle cap back. Then push firmly on.
The needle can puncture the cap if it is recapped at an angle.

Grip and squeeze the widest part of the outer needle cap. Turn your pen several times with your other hand to remove the needle.
Try again if the needle does not come off the first time.

Throw away the used needle in a puncture-resistant container (see " Throwing your pen away " at the end of this Instructions for Use).

Put your pen cap back on.
Do not put the pen back in the refrigerator.

### Diagnosis, management and treatment of the Alport syndrome-2024 guideline on behalf of ERKNet, ERA and ESPN [^1132mtHA]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for Alport syndrome, more specifically with respect to eligibility for kidney donation, ERA/ERN ERKNet/ESPN 2025 guidelines recommend to consider using relatives with heterozygous Alport syndrome variants (males or females with heterozygous pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in COL4A3 or COL4A4 or females with a variant in COL4A5) only as the last possible resource for living kidney donation.

### Uncertainty of risk estimates from clinical prediction models: rationale, challenges, and approaches [^114xKMQX]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Fig 5
Example of a calibration plot containing a smoothed calibration curve and its 95% confidence interval, from an external validation of a model to estimate five year recurrence risk after a primary breast cancer diagnosis; modified from Riley et al with permission. Histograms beneath the plot show the distribution of estimated risks for those with and with no recurrence by five years. Example code to generate this plot is available from. CI = confidence interval

A drawback is that, as these intervals are conditional only on the estimated risk, they do not take into account any other characteristics such as an individual's specific predictor values; hence, the intervals are less individualised than those derived using the development itself (which are conditional on specific predictor values). To partly address this, calibration plots and curves can also be derived separately for subgroups defined by particular (combinations of) predictor values or other characteristics, for example, defined by age, sex, and ethnic group; this may also inform model fairness checks. However, as each subgroup will have a smaller sample size than the overall dataset, the uncertainty intervals around their calibration curves may be wide, unless the overall dataset is very large.

Sometimes the uncertainty interval around the calibration curve may not even contain the corresponding risk estimate from the original model. For example, figure 5 shows that for individuals with an estimated risk of 0.2, the 95% confidence interval for this group's actual risk is about 0.25 to 0.45 in the validation data. This value may be due to chance but could also be due to the original model being miscalibrated in the evaluation population (eg, due to a different case-mix or different predictor effects), which might motivate strategies to update and recalibrate the original model. As updating a model is akin to developing a new one, uncertainty distributions and intervals can then be derived by the methods explained in the previous section (eg, a bootstrap process).

### Ivabradine [^113jm1tn]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

N: number of patients at risk; n: number of patients having experienced the endpoint; %: incidence rate = (n/N) × 100; % PY: annual incidence rate = (n/number of patient-years) × 100; CI: confidence interval

The hazard ratio between treatment groups (ivabradine/placebo) was estimated based on an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model with beta-blocker intake at randomization (yes/no) as a covariate; p-value: Wald test

The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 3) shows time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of hospitalization for worsening heart failure or cardiovascular death in the overall study.

Figure 3. SHIFT: Time to First Event of Primary Composite Endpoint

Most of the results show effects consistent with the overall study result. Ivabradine benefit on the primary endpoint in SHIFT appeared to decrease as the dose of beta-blockers increased, with little if any benefit demonstrated in patients taking guideline-defined target doses of beta-blockers.

Figure 4. Effect of Treatment on Primary Composite Endpoint in Subgroups

Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups, all of which are baseline characteristics. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account the number of comparisons made and may not reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted.

### Malpractice litigation related to management of varicocele: a legal database review [^116MrxKo]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

The Casetext online legal database was queried for cases with the terms: "Malpractice and (Varicocele or Varicocelectomy)". Casetext maintains a database that provides state and federal case summaries and transcripts. It covers all 50 state and federal cases, statutes, regulations, and rules. Because the cases in Casetext are publicly available, our study did not need Institutional Review Board review.

Cases that included varicocele management and with a final judgment were included. We excluded cases in which varicocele management was not the medical issue being discussed. We documented the following variables for each case: date of case, whether a urologist was involved in the defense, whether the plaintiff was incarcerated, alleged breaches of duty, alleged damages, and legal outcome. Data were analyzed using descriptive characteristics.
