## Question

What symptoms occur in pregnant women infected with hepatitis E virus?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what symptoms occur in pregnant women infected with hepatitis E virus (HEV). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overall clinical spectrum from asymptomatic infection to fulminant disease. Then, I should verify the typical prodromal and icteric-phase features and how they overlap with pregnancy symptoms. Next, I will assess pregnancy-specific severity markers and complications, followed by obstetric and fetal consequences including vertical transmission. After that, I need to consider atypical extrahepatic manifestations. Finally, I will integrate genotype and geographic variation, and close with diagnostic triggers and management implications to ensure we do not miss severe disease or delay care [^116SHdLR] [^111rsREM] [^112mpxN4].

> Let me first confirm the clinical spectrum in pregnancy, because the baseline range frames everything else. HEV infection can be asymptomatic or present as an acute hepatitis syndrome with constitutional and gastrointestinal symptoms, and in a subset of pregnant patients in endemic settings it can rapidly progress to fulminant hepatic failure with high maternal mortality, which contrasts with the typically self-limited course in the general population [^116SHdLR]. Approximately 40% of infections can be clinically apparent with hepatitis-like features in some series, while asymptomatic infection is common, particularly with genotype 3 in developed countries, so I should not assume every infected pregnant patient will be jaundiced or toxic-appearing at first presentation [^112JZ2gf] [^116SHdLR]. Hold on, I should verify severity estimates in pregnancy: observational and systematic data from high-endemic regions show increased fulminant hepatic failure and a several-fold higher maternal mortality compared to non-HEV acute hepatitis in pregnancy, underscoring the need for early recognition [^111rsREM] [^111ARrZE] [^114acHvj].

> I will now examine the prodromal or pre-icteric phase because early, non-specific symptoms often overlap with normal pregnancy and drive diagnostic delay. After an incubation of about 2–6 weeks, patients can develop low-grade fever, profound fatigue or asthenia, malaise, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, and sometimes diarrhea, and I need to remember these are indistinguishable from other causes of acute viral hepatitis and from common pregnancy complaints like hyperemesis gravidarum, which is why a high index of suspicion matters when transaminases are elevated or symptoms escalate [^112JZ2gf] [^116SHdLR]. Wait, let me verify timing: these prodromal symptoms precede jaundice by several days, so laboratory testing may already show rising aminotransferases even before visible icterus, which can help anchor the diagnosis earlier if we test for HEV alongside HAV, HBV, and HSV in pregnant patients with acute hepatitis presentations [^112JZ2gf] [^116UEisX].

> Next, I should review the icteric-phase manifestations that define clinically apparent hepatitis. Typical features include new-onset jaundice with scleral icterus, generalized pruritus due to cholestasis, dark urine from bilirubinuria, and pale or clay-colored stools, often accompanied by persistent anorexia, nausea, and vomiting, which together should prompt evaluation for acute viral hepatitis including HEV in pregnancy [^112JZ2gf] [^116SHdLR] [^117XqBQ7]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wrote that these findings are reported in 40% of symptomatic patients; that phrasing is off, because the 40% estimate refers to the proportion of infections that become symptomatic with hepatitis-like features rather than a subset of already symptomatic cases, so I should correct that to avoid misinterpretation [^112JZ2gf]. I need to ensure labs align with the clinical picture, expecting marked ALT and AST elevations and hyperbilirubinemia that typically rise before and then resolve within 2–3 months in survivors, though the trajectory may be more volatile in severe pregnancy-associated disease [^112JZ2gf] [^116SHdLR].

> Let me consider pregnancy-specific severity markers because these are the red flags that should trigger urgent escalation. Fulminant hepatic failure can occur in roughly 15–30% of symptomatic pregnant patients with genotype 1 or 2 in endemic settings, with hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and hypoglycemia signaling decompensation, and the risk appears highest in the second and third trimesters and around the peripartum period, which means timing in gestation materially alters risk stratification and monitoring intensity [^113Vm9um] [^112tD5sL] [^111ARrZE]. I should double-check the trimester effect: data show a greater proportion of fulminant hepatic failure after the first trimester, consistent with reported immuno-hormonal shifts that may exacerbate HEV pathogenesis in late pregnancy, so I must not downplay mild early symptoms that evolve later in gestation [^112tD5sL] [^115s82dj]. Hold on, I should verify viremia dynamics too, because longer viremia in pregnancy can reflect impaired viral clearance and correlate with severity, which supports closer follow up even when symptoms initially abate [^115WCTTg].

> I will now enumerate the obstetric and fetal consequences, because these often co-present as clinical concerns and can be the first clue to severe maternal disease. HEV in pregnancy is associated with significantly higher risks of antepartum hemorrhage, preterm labor, spontaneous abortion particularly with genotype 1 earlier in gestation, and postpartum hemorrhage, compared with non-HEV acute hepatitis comparators, so obstetric teams should be alerted early when hepatitis E is suspected [^111rsREM] [^111ARrZE]. I need to check fetal and neonatal outcomes: intrauterine fetal death, stillbirth, and premature delivery rates are elevated, and vertical transmission occurs in roughly one-third to nearly one-half of infants born to viremic mothers, with affected neonates presenting with anicteric or icteric hepatitis and potentially hypoglycemia and hypothermia, which means neonatal teams should be prepared for early evaluation and supportive management at delivery [^113jJBZw] [^116rLfty] [^1168HAuo] [^116SHdLR] [^112vgVw3]. But wait, what if vertical transmission risk is overestimated in some cohorts due to selection bias; pooled estimates around 36.9% in meta-analysis still support substantial risk, and maternal viral load appears to predict transmission, so assessing viremia near delivery may refine neonatal risk counseling [^113jJBZw] [^1168HAuo].

> Next, I should review atypical extrahepatic manifestations because they can confuse the differential, particularly in low-endemic settings. Neurological syndromes such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, brachial neuritis, transverse myelitis, cranial neuropathies, and even MuSK antibody–positive myasthenia gravis have been reported in association with acute or chronic HEV, more often with genotype 3 in immunocompetent hosts, so unexplained neuromuscular symptoms with elevated transaminases in pregnancy should still prompt HEV testing, even outside endemic regions [^116SHdLR] [^1122oJpn]. I should confirm that these are rare in pregnancy specifically; while data are sparse, vigilance is warranted, and a normal bile duct ultrasound does not exclude HEV-related neuropathy when serology or RNA testing is positive, so I should not anchor prematurely on obstetric neuropathies alone [^116SHdLR] [^1122oJpn].

> Let me consider genotype and geography because they strongly modulate clinical severity and the symptom profile. In high-endemic regions across Asia and Africa where genotypes 1 and 2 predominate, symptomatic infection in pregnancy is common and carries high risks of fulminant hepatic failure and maternal and fetal mortality, whereas in low-endemic regions with genotype 3 predominance, infections are often asymptomatic or mild, and reported pregnancy cases usually have favorable outcomes, though underdiagnosis is likely and neurological presentations may be relatively overrepresented due to ascertainment [^116SHdLR] [^111Tef3K] [^117B2W1o] [^112ZkKyJ] [^113BuHmY]. Hold on, I should verify the pathobiology angle: ex vivo data suggest genotype 1 replicates more efficiently at the maternal–fetal interface and perturbs local cytokine milieus, plausibly contributing to placental disease and severe maternal outcomes, which aligns with the epidemiology of severe disease in endemic regions and supports a genotype-specific virulence hypothesis [^116cthzE] [^113Vm9um].

> Now, I need to ensure the diagnostic triggers and immediate management implications are clear to translate the symptom review into action. Any pregnant patient with acute hepatitis symptoms or new jaundice should be tested for HEV alongside other hepatotropic viruses, because the clinical syndrome is non-specific and delayed testing risks missing deterioration; both EASL 2018 HEV guidance and the ACG pregnancy guideline endorse routine consideration of HEV in this context, and serology with IgM and RNA confirms active infection when available [^117XqBQ7] [^116UEisX] [^112JZ2gf]. I should double-check the escalation plan: EASL recommends admitting pregnant patients with genotype 1 or 2 infection to a high-dependency setting and urgent transfer to a transplant-capable center if acute liver failure develops, and for acute severe HEV with encephalopathy grades I–III, early delivery or therapeutic termination may be considered to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality after multidisciplinary review, while vaginal delivery need not be discouraged and breastfeeding should not be discouraged in asymptomatic mothers [^112mpxN4] [^1119KRhX] [^114oqjbS] [^113yV6ZF]. Let me reconsider comorbid risks: HIV coinfection can be associated with more protracted HEV courses and higher seroprevalence, so I should screen for HIV and counsel accordingly when HEV is diagnosed in pregnancy, recognizing that coinfections like HBV and HCV are also more frequent in HEV-associated hospitalizations in the U.S. dataset and may compound coagulopathy risks [^112DAX2M] [^113BuHmY].

> To synthesize, the core symptom pattern in pregnant women with HEV spans from asymptomatic infection to a prodromal phase of low-grade fever, malaise, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting, followed by an icteric phase characterized by jaundice, pruritus, dark urine, pale stools, and biochemical hepatitis, with a subset progressing to fulminant hepatic failure marked by encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and hypoglycemia, especially in the second and third trimesters in endemic regions, and these maternal presentations are frequently accompanied by obstetric complications, fetal loss, prematurity, and not infrequently vertical transmission with neonatal hepatitis, all of which require early recognition and coordinated obstetric–hepatology–neonatal care to mitigate the high risks unique to pregnancy [^112JZ2gf] [^116SHdLR] [^111rsREM] [^111ARrZE] [^113jJBZw] [^1168HAuo].

Pregnant women with hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection typically develop **nonspecific prodromal symptoms** — fatigue, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, low-grade fever, and abdominal discomfort [^112JZ2gf] — followed by **jaundice and pruritus**, with dark urine and pale stools [^116SHdLR]. In pregnancy — especially in the second and third trimesters — HEV can rapidly progress to **fulminant hepatic failure/acute liver failure**, with encephalopathy and coagulopathy, leading to **high maternal mortality (up to 20–40%)** [^111ARrZE] and severe fetal outcomes, including stillbirth, preterm birth, and neonatal death [^111rsREM]. **Vertical transmission** [^113jJBZw] is common, and neurological complications such as seizures and encephalopathy may occur [^116SHdLR] [^1122oJpn]. Early recognition and supportive care are critical due to the **high risk of rapid deterioration** [^112mpxN4].

---

## Clinical presentation in pregnant women

HEV infection in pregnancy presents along a spectrum, from mild nonspecific symptoms to severe hepatic complications. The course is often **more severe in pregnant women**, particularly in the **second and third trimesters**, than in non-pregnant individuals [^111rsREM].

---

### Nonspecific prodromal symptoms

- **Fatigue and malaise**: Common initial symptoms, often mistaken for normal pregnancy-related fatigue [^116SHdLR].
- **Nausea and vomiting**: Frequently reported, sometimes severe enough to mimic hyperemesis gravidarum [^112JZ2gf].
- **Anorexia**: Loss of appetite is common [^116SHdLR].
- **Low-grade fever**: Mild fever may precede hepatic symptoms [^116SHdLR].
- **Abdominal discomfort**: Particularly in the right upper quadrant, due to hepatic inflammation [^112JZ2gf].

---

### Hepatic symptoms

Hepatic symptoms commonly include **jaundice** [^112JZ2gf], a hallmark of acute hepatitis E [^116SHdLR]. Pruritus results from **cholestasis and elevated bilirubin** [^112JZ2gf]. Dark urine and pale stools also reflect **hepatic dysfunction and cholestasis** [^116SHdLR].

---

### Severe hepatic complications

Pregnant women — especially in the second and third trimesters — are at markedly increased risk of severe hepatic complications [^111rsREM]. Fulminant hepatic failure may rapidly evolve to acute liver failure with **encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and multi-organ dysfunction** [^116SHdLR]. Hepatic encephalopathy causes **altered mental status, confusion, and coma** due to hepatic dysfunction [^112JZ2gf]. Coagulopathy presents as an **increased bleeding tendency** due to impaired hepatic synthesis of clotting factors [^116SHdLR].

---

## Trimester-specific severity

The severity of HEV infection in pregnancy **varies by trimester**:

| **Trimester** | **Severity of HEV infection** | **Clinical manifestations** |
|-|-|-|
| First trimester | Mild to moderate severity | - Nonspecific symptoms <br/> - Jaundice <br/> - Rarely severe hepatic complications |
| Second trimester | Moderate to severe severity | - Increased risk of fulminant hepatic failure [^112JZ2gf] <br/> - Hepatic encephalopathy <br/> - Coagulopathy [^112tD5sL] |
| Third trimester | Severe severity | - High risk of fulminant hepatic failure <br/> - Hepatic encephalopathy <br/> - Coagulopathy <br/> - High maternal mortality (up to 20–40%) [^111rsREM] |

---

## Maternal complications

HEV infection in pregnancy is associated with **fulminant hepatic failure** in approximately 15–30% of cases, particularly in the third trimester. Maternal mortality is **high (20–40% in endemic regions)** [^111ARrZE]. Obstetric complications — **including antepartum hemorrhage, postpartum hemorrhage, and eclampsia** — are also increased [^111rsREM].

---

## Fetal and neonatal complications

HEV in pregnancy markedly affects **fetal and neonatal outcomes**, including:

- **Vertical transmission**: HEV can be transmitted from mother to fetus, with reported transmission rates ranging from 33–50% [^112vgVw3] [^113jJBZw].

- **Stillbirth and intrauterine fetal death**: Increased risk of stillbirth and intrauterine fetal demise [^111rsREM].

- **Preterm birth**: High incidence of preterm labor and delivery [^111rsREM].

- **Low birth weight**: Increased risk of low birth weight infants [^113jJBZw].

- **Neonatal hepatitis**: Neonates may develop acute hepatitis, jaundice, and hepatic dysfunction [^112vgVw3] [^116SHdLR].

---

## Neurological and systemic complications

In addition to hepatic disease, HEV in pregnancy can cause **neurological and systemic complications**. Neurological complications include **seizures, encephalopathy, and rare syndromes such as Guillain-Barré syndrome** [^116SHdLR] [^1122oJpn], while **systemic complications** include acute pancreatitis, hematological abnormalities, and autoimmune phenomena [^116SHdLR].

---

## Laboratory findings

Laboratory evaluation in pregnant women with HEV infection typically reveals:

- **Elevated liver enzymes**: Markedly elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels [^116SHdLR].
- **Elevated bilirubin**: Hyperbilirubinemia consistent with hepatic dysfunction [^112JZ2gf].
- **Prolonged prothrombin time**: Indicative of coagulopathy and hepatic synthetic dysfunction [^116SHdLR].
- **Positive HEV serology**: Detection of anti-HEV IgM antibodies and/or HEV RNA confirms acute infection [^117XqBQ7].

---

## Summary of clinical manifestations

| **Clinical manifestation** | **Frequency in pregnant women** |
|-|-|
| - Fatigue <br/> - Nausea <br/> - Vomiting <br/> - Anorexia | Common |
| - Jaundice <br/> - Pruritus <br/> - Dark urine <br/> - Pale stools | Common |
| Fulminant hepatic failure | 15–30% [^113Vm9um] |
| Hepatic encephalopathy | Common in severe cases |
| Coagulopathy | Common in severe cases |

### Maternal and fetal outcomes in pregnant women with acute hepatitis E virus infection [^111rsREM]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). High credibility.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is known to cause severe liver disease in pregnant women. It is unclear whether obstetric and fetal outcomes are worse in pregnant women with HEV infection than in women with other forms of viral hepatitis.

- **Objective**: To compare maternal, obstetric, and fetal outcomes in pregnant women with acute viral hepatitis caused by HEV and other hepatitis viruses.

- **Design**: Observational cohort.

- **Setting**: Tertiary care hospital, New Delhi, India.

- **Patients**: 220 consecutive pregnant women presenting with jaundice caused by acute viral hepatitis.

- **Measurements**: Maternal mortality and medical complications, obstetric complications, deliveries, and fetal outcomes.

- **Results**: Infection with HEV caused acute viral hepatitis in 60% of included women. Fulminant hepatic failure was more common (relative risk, 2.7 [95% CI, 1.7 to 4.2]; P = 0.001) and maternal mortality was greater (relative risk, 6.0 [CI, 2.7 to 13.3]; P < 0.001) in HEV-infected women than in non-HEV-infected women. Women with HEV infection were more likely than those with other forms of viral hepatitis to have obstetric complications (relative risk, 4.1 [CI, 1.7 to 10.2] for antepartum hemorrhage and 1.9 [CI, 1.3 to 2.7] for intrauterine fetal death; P < 0.001 for both) and poor fetal outcomes (relative risk, 1.2 [CI, 1.0 to 1.4] for preterm delivery [P = 0.005] and 1.8 [CI, 1.2 to 2.5] for stillbirth [P = 0.026]).

- **Limitations**: The findings may not apply to community settings, to women who are asymptomatic or have only minor symptoms, or in the setting of an HEV epidemic.

### Myasthenia gravis associated with acute hepatitis E infection in immunocompetent woman [^1122oJpn]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a common cause of acute hepatitis in developing countries. The course of acute hepatitis E is usually benign, except in pregnant women and immunocompromised patients, who are prone to a lethal or chronic outcome of the disease. Since 2001, hepatitis E has been emerging in industrialized countries, and neurologic manifestations such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, brachial neuritis, transverse myelitis, and cranial nerve palsies have been reported in patients with acute or chronic forms of the disease. Most cases with neurologic manifestations have been characterized by infection with genotype 3 HEV. Data are not available to indicate whether this association between HEV infection and neurologic manifestations is related to a specific antigenic stimulus provided by HEV or is linked to the more comprehensive assessment for such neurologic conditions that is available in industrialized countries or to a reporting bias. We report a case of HEV infection in an immunocompetent woman who had muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) antibody–positive myasthenia gravis associated with HEV replication.

A 33-year-old woman was hospitalized in France for subacute asthenia and intermittent symptoms including dysarthria, dysphagia, muscle weakness, and diplopia. She had no family history of autoimmune disease and no notable personal medical history; she had not received any recent vaccinations and had not traveled outside France during the previous year. Physical examination showed no pyramidal, vestibular, or cerebellar syndromes, and all tendon reflexes were intact.

### Viral hepatitis in pregnancy [^112JZ2gf]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Low credibility.

- **Clinical and laboratory diagnosis**: Acute cases of HEV in pregnancy are not clinically distinguishable from other types of AVH. Asymptomatic infection is common. The incubation period is 2–6 weeks. When symptoms develop, patients suffer from low-grade fever, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. Approximately 40% of patients experience hepatitis-like symptoms, such as jaundice, pruritus, dark urine, and pale stools.

- **Chronic HEV infection**: Immunosuppressed individuals, particularly solid organ transplant recipients receiving immunosuppressive medication, may fail to clear the virus after primary infection, leading to chronic HEV infection lasting more than 6 months.

- **Laboratory diagnosis**: The diagnosis of HEV infection depends on the detection of HEV antigen, HEV RNA, and antibodies against HEV. Anti-HEV IgM antibodies can be detected during the acute phase and last 4–5 months, representing recent exposure, whereas anti-HEV IgG antibodies can last more than 10 years, representing remote exposure.

- **Serological diagnosis**: ELISA assays are used to measure specific anti-HEV IgG and IgM. Sera/plasma samples are tested for anti-HEV IgG and IgM. Positive anti-HEV IgM and/or rising anti-HEV IgG within 1 month could be considered diagnostic for active infection.

- **HEV antigens**: Detection of HEV antigen has been developed as an interesting, low-cost, and rapid diagnostic technique to ascertain HEV viraemia where facilities for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are unavailable.

- **Molecular diagnosis of HEV**: RT-PCR is used for detecting HEV RNA, offering a more conclusive method for confirming infection.

### Hepatitis E during pregnancy: Maternal and foetal case-fatality rates and adverse outcomes — a systematic review [^111ARrZE]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2019). Low credibility.

Hepatitis E virus infection during pregnancy can have severe consequences for both mother and child, including vertical transmission, fulminant hepatic failure, and even foetal or maternal mortality. This systematic review aims to describe maternal, foetal, and neonatal case-fatality rates, as well as the prevalence of adverse outcomes, in relation to hepatitis E virus infection during pregnancy. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and CINAHL using search terms such as pregnant, women, maternal, infant, foetal, neonatal, and hepatitis E virus. Data were extracted using predefined data collection forms, and all studies were quality assessed, either by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale or an adapted assessment scale for cross-sectional studies.

We identified 23 eligible studies, all observational, which were included in this systematic review, encompassing a total of 1338 cases. The median maternal, foetal, and neonatal case-fatality rates were 26% (IQR 17%-41%), 33% (IQR 19%-37%), and 8% (IQR 3%-20%), respectively. Adverse outcomes such as fulminant hepatic failure, preterm labour, postpartum haemorrhage, low birth weight, and vertical transmission were reported. The two studies that reported the highest prevalence of fulminant hepatic failure also reported the highest case-fatality rates, with a median prevalence of fulminant hepatic failure at 45.3%.

This systematic review found a high case-fatality rate among pregnant women infected with hepatitis E virus and a significant rate of adverse outcomes for these women and their children. The results from this review mainly apply to regions where the included studies were conducted.

### Burden of hepatitis E virus infection in pregnancy and maternofoetal outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113jJBZw]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Low credibility.

- **Meta-regression analysis of HEV infection prevalence**: Three studies with a total of 155 women reported data on HEV vertical transmission. The pooled estimate of vertical transmission was 36.9% (95% CI 13.3–64.2) (Fig. 3). All three studies diagnosed HEV infection using neonatal cord-blood samples.

- **Maternofoetal outcomes in HEV infection**: A total of 479 HEV positive and 490 HEV negative women from five studies were included to investigate the association between HEV infection and maternofoetal outcomes. HEV infection during pregnancy was associated with low birth weight (OR: 3.23; 95% CI: 1.71–6.10), small for gestational age (OR: 3.63; 95% CI: 1.25–10.49), preterm < 32 weeks (OR: 4.18; 95% CI: 1.23–14.20), and preterm < 37 weeks (OR: 3.45; 95% CI: 2.32–5.13) (Fig. 4). HEV infection during pregnancy was also associated with stillbirth (OR: 2.61; 95% CI: 1.64–4.14) and intrauterine deaths (OR: 3.07; 95% CI: 2.13–4.43), but not with miscarriage (OR: 1.74; 95% CI: 0.77–3.90) (Fig. 5). HEV infection during pregnancy increased the likelihood of maternal deaths (pooled OR 7.17; 95% CI: 3.32–15.47) (Fig. 5).

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on the management of liver diseases in pregnancy [^111arUA6]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

The EASL 2023 guidelines specifically address the management of hepatitis B virus infection in pregnant patients. They recommend initiating antiviral prophylaxis with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate at week 24–28 of gestation. This prophylaxis should continue up to 12 weeks after delivery in pregnant patients who have positive HBeAg or HBV DNA levels greater than 200,000 IU/mL.

### Hepatitis E, a vaccine-preventable cause of maternal deaths [^112Y6NuB]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

- **Contribution of hepatitis and hepatitis-like symptoms as direct or underlying causes of death in women of reproductive age, northwestern Bangladesh, 2001–2007**:
	- Defined as deaths of women who were pregnant or within 42 days of termination of the pregnancy, irrespective of the cause of death.

Verbal autopsy results and other epidemiologic evidence also implicate hepatitis E as the probable cause of most deaths from sporadic hepatitis-like illness in the rural JiVitA cohort, with sudden onset of symptoms in the days or weeks before death. Although our surveillance system did not enable laboratory-based differential diagnosis of individual cases, hepatitis A, B, and C are unlikely to play a major role in deaths in this population of women. Clinical studies of acute liver failure in Bangladesh have shown HEV to be the main etiologic agent responsible.

Serosurveys in rural Bangladesh have demonstrated nearly universal exposure to hepatitis A virus during childhood, with subsequent lifelong immunity, implying an extremely low probability of symptomatic hepatitis A virus infection during pregnancy. Hepatitis C virus is rare in low-risk rural populations, with a prevalence of IgG against hepatitis C virus of approximately 1.5%. Hepatitis B virus is endemic to rural Bangladesh, but the incidence of infection and illness are also low. Therefore, hepatitis E remains the most likely etiologic agent for these fatal hepatitis-like illnesses in pregnant women.

If these numbers are, as we suspect, representative of women of reproductive age and of the incidence of hepatitis throughout Bangladesh…

### Genotype specific pathogenicity of hepatitis E virus at the human maternal-fetal interface [^115kaD5e]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

Despite the scarce information concerning HEV-3 during pregnancy, the lack of clinical manifestations suggests that the pro-inflammatory response to HEV-3 may correspond to a minor bystander effect that is harmless to fetal development. It is also possible that elements of the maternal immune system might limit HEV-3 replication at the maternal-fetal interface, avoiding any pregnancy complications. We have previously demonstrated that Natural Killer cells from the maternal innate immune system can control the replication of human immunodeficiency virus and cytomegalovirus, preventing the development of congenital infection.

Most pregnancy diseases related to HEV-1 infection have been reported mainly in the second and third trimesters. Lessons learned from the TORCH pathogens have demonstrated that infections during early pregnancy are highly detrimental to fetal development. However, HEV-1-induced illness during the first trimester has not been well documented, although it might be detrimental to pregnancy outcomes. Even if our ex vivo model of first trimester pregnancy, similar to any other experimental model, has its limits, our findings within this model are the first suggesting that HEV-1 infection in early pregnancy may result in clinical symptoms that can be intermingled with pregnancy disorders, such as spontaneous abortion or preeclampsia. The immunological and hormonal changes in later terms may then worsen the outcome of the pregnancy. Additional studies using samples from term pregnancy and/or in utero infected women as well as other viral infections are needed to further understand these observations.

### Hepatitis C virus in pregnancy [^115pUtuu]. American Journal of Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

Despite recent advances in the pathogenesis, treatment, and public health response to hepatitis C virus (HCV), HCV as it specifically relates to pregnancy has been a neglected condition. HCV-monoinfected pregnant women have a 2–8% risk of viral transmission to their infant, but the mechanism and timing of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) are not fully understood, nor is the natural history of the illness in pregnant women and their offspring. Recognition of HCV-infected pregnant women is relevant because of the long-term health implications for the mother, potential adverse effects of infection on pregnancy outcomes, and the possibility of transmission to their infants. Certain risk factors for MTCT of HCV appear similar to those for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); however, unlike HIV, effective methods for prevention of HCV vertical transmission have not been developed. It is possible that a better understanding of HCV MTCT and pathogenesis in pregnancy will guide the development of useful prevention strategies, particularly as we enter an era where interferon-free drug cocktails may emerge as viable treatment options for HCV.

### Prevalence of hepatitis E virus and its association with adverse pregnancy outcomes in pregnant women in China [^116VWQaQ]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2023). Low credibility.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection has become a global concern, especially in pregnant women. However, the association between HEV prevalence and age, gravidity, and parity of pregnant women remains unclear. Pregnant women (n = 19,762) were enrolled for HEV prevalence and associated adverse pregnancy outcomes investigation in Qujing City, Yunnan Province of China from May 2019 to December 2020.

The seroprevalence of HEV was 11.6% (2,297/19,762; 95% CI: 11.2%-12.1%). About 11.4% (2,247/19,762; 95% CI: 10.9%-11.8%) were positive for anti-HEV IgG antibody, 0.1% (22/19,762; 95% CI: 0.1%-0.2%) were positive for anti-HEV IgM antibody, and 0.1% (28/19,762; 95% CI: 0.1%-0.2%) were positive for both anti-HEV IgM and IgG antibodies. Sixty-one out of 2,297 anti-HEV-antibodies-positive pregnant women were positive for HEV RNA. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all HEV isolates from pregnant women belong to genotype 4. Age, gravidity, and parity are associated with an increased prevalence of HEV.

Pregnant women positive for HEV-IgG antibody bear a higher risk for an adverse pregnancy history and liver injury, with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels than anti-HEV-negative pregnant women. Furthermore, seropositive pregnant women suffered a higher adverse maternal outcomes risk (crude odds ratio [cOR] = 1.29; 95% CI: 1.16–1.43; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.25–1.55 for anti-HEV-IgG-positive pregnant women and cOR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.02–1.86; aOR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.05–1.95 for anti-HEV-IgM-positive pregnant women).

### Clinical presentation of hepatitis E [^116SHdLR]. Virus Research (2011). High credibility.

Hepatitis E is a form of acute hepatitis caused by infection with the hepatitis E virus. The infection is transmitted primarily through the fecal-oral route, and the disease is highly endemic in several developing countries where contamination of drinking water is common. In these high-endemicity areas, hepatitis E occurs as outbreaks and sporadic cases of acute hepatitis. The illness often resembles that associated with other hepatotropic viruses and is usually self-limiting; however, in some cases, the disease progresses to acute liver failure. The infection is particularly severe in pregnant women. Patients with chronic liver disease who experience superimposed HEV infection can present with severe liver injury, referred to as acute-on-chronic liver failure.

In recent years, occasional sporadic cases of locally acquired hepatitis E have been reported in several developed countries, including those in Europe, the United States, and Asia. In these regions, in addition to acute hepatitis similar to that seen in highly endemic areas, chronic hepatitis E has been reported among immunosuppressed persons, particularly solid organ transplant recipients. HEV-infected mothers can transmit the infection to the fetus, leading to premature birth, increased fetal loss, hypoglycemia, hypothermia, and anicteric or icteric acute hepatitis in newborns. Occasional cases with atypical non-hepatic manifestations, such as acute pancreatitis, hematological abnormalities, autoimmune phenomena, and neurological syndromes, have been reported from both hyperendemic and non-endemic regions.

### Fetal and neonatal health consequences of vertically transmitted hepatitis E virus infection [^112vgVw3]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2014). Low credibility.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections lead to tens of thousands of deaths annually, mostly in developing countries. Hepatitis E poses a significant threat to the health of expectant mothers, a well-noted epidemiologic feature of the disease, but the contribution of vertically transmitted HEV infection to fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality has received limited attention. Evidence assembled at the time of writing suggests that mother-to-child HEV transmission may be frequent and deleterious to the fetus and newborn in pregnancies affected by hepatitis E. Additional work is required to resolve key questions.

1. **What risks do subclinical maternal HEV infections and infections early in pregnancy pose to fetal health and development?**
2. **Does vertical transmission occur during labor and/or breastfeeding and contribute appreciably to neonatal morbidity and mortality?**
3. **How do treatment decisions for severely ill mothers affect fetal and neonatal outcomes?**
4. **Can maternal vaccination effectively prevent vertical transmission of HEV?**

### Burden of hepatitis E virus infection in pregnancy and maternofoetal outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116rLfty]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Low credibility.

There is still a dearth of knowledge on the burden of HEV infection in the global population of pregnant women. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the global burden of HEV infection in pregnancy.

- **Methods**: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Knowledge, and Global Index Medicus to identify articles published until January 26, 2020. We considered cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies reporting the immunoglobulins M HEV seroprevalence in asymptomatic and symptomatic (jaundice or elevated transaminases) pregnant women, or investigating the association between HEV infection and maternofoetal outcomes. We used a random-effects model to pool studies. This review was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018093820.

- **Results**: For HEV prevalence estimates, we included 52 studies (11,663 pregnant women). The seroprevalence was 3.5% (95% confidence interval: 1.4–6.4) in asymptomatic women, most of whom were from high endemic areas. The prevalence in symptomatic women was 49.6% (42.6–56.7) with data only from HEV high endemic countries. In the multivariable meta-regression model, the prevalence was higher in symptomatic women compared to asymptomatic (adjusted prevalence odds ratio [aPOR]: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.61–1.91) and decreased with increasing year of publication (by 10-year) (aPOR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.84–0.96). The proportion of HEV vertical transmission was 36.9% (13.3–64.2). Risk of bias was low, moderate, and high, respectively, in 12 (23%), 37 (70%), and 4 studies (7%) addressing HEV prevalence estimation.

### Burden of hepatitis E virus infection in pregnancy and maternofoetal outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1132MMi4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Low credibility.

- **Results**

- **Study selection and characteristics**: In total, we identified 597 records, of which 54 were finally included (Supplementary Fig. 1). The agreement between review authors for study selection based on title and abstract (κ = 0.89) and data extraction (κ = 0.78) were moderate to high. Among the 54 included studies performed in 22 countries, 51 had been conducted to estimate HEV prevalence (Supplementary Table 4) and 5 to investigate the association between HEV and maternofoetal outcomes (Supplementary Table 5). The risk of bias was low, moderate, and high in 12 (23%), 37 (70%), and 4 studies (7%) addressing HEV prevalence estimation, respectively. All studies that assessed the association between HEV infection and maternofoetal outcomes had a moderate risk of bias. Overall, 53 (98%) studies were cross-sectional and one (2%) was case-control. Among the countries where studies were conducted, 29 (54%) were in South-East Asia, 10 in Eastern Mediterranean (18%), 6 in Africa (11%), 4 (7%) in Europe, 3 (6%) in Western Pacific, and 2 (4%) in The Americas. Clinically, pregnant women were symptomatic in 29 studies (54%) (Supplementary Table 6). The prevalence of viral hepatitis A, viral hepatitis B, viral hepatitis C, and viral hepatitis D varied from 0 to 14.6% (n = 23 studies), from 0 to 31.3% (n = 27 studies), from 0 to 13.5% (n = 23 studies), and from 0 to 1.5% (n = 3 studies), respectively.

### Burden of hepatitis E virus infection in pregnancy and maternofoetal outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111jMiKn]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Low credibility.

Using a pretested data extraction form, two review authors (JJB and AFM) independently extracted relevant information, including:

- **Study details**: First author, publication year, period of participants' recruitment
- **Location information**: Country, site, area, setting, WHO region
- **Study specifics**: Timing of data collection, study design, sampling method, sample size, samples tested for HEV
- **Participant data**: Number of participants with IgM of HEV in blood or stool, number of participants with maternofoetal complications

Additionally, for each country of study recruitment, data on the human development index (HDI) were retrieved. We defined two groups of pregnant women based on clinical presentation at HEV screening:

- **Symptomatic pregnant women**: Signs suggestive of acute hepatitis, including jaundice and/or elevated transaminases
- **Asymptomatic pregnant women**

When relevant data from included studies were not available, corresponding authors were contacted at least twice for clarification.

Methodological quality and risk of bias assessment involved:

- **Prevalence of HEV**: An adapted version of the tool developed by Hoy and colleagues (see Supplementary Table 2)
- **HEV infection and maternofoetal outcomes**: An adapted version of the ROBINS-I tool (see Supplementary Table 3)
- **Review process**: Two review authors (AFM and JJB) independently ran the assessment; discrepancies were arbitrated by a third review author (JRN)

### Risk factors for vertical transmission of hepatitis E virus infection [^1168HAuo]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2017). Low credibility.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection can be vertically transmitted; however, the factors contributing to transmission to fetuses remain unclear. A study was conducted involving 144 pregnant women with HEV infection. Cord blood and newborn samples were collected for analysis. Nutritional factors were evaluated based on anthropometric parameters and biochemical factors, while HEV viral load was quantified using real-time PCR. HEV-positive samples were sequenced.

Approximately 14.63% (6/41) of pregnant patients with acute liver failure (ALF) died before delivery. Vertical transmission was observed in 46.09% (59/128) of HEV-IgM-positive mothers. In the acute viral hepatitis group, 23.80% (10/42) of newborns were positive for HEV-RNA, compared to 29.41% (5/17) in the ALF group. No significant difference in the occurrence of vertical transmission was observed between HEV groups.

- **Viral load as a predictor**: Viral load emerged as a significant predictor for vertical transmission of HEV infection, adjusted for hemoglobin and folate levels in the derivation cohort group. By incorporating these variables, a new predictive score for vertical transmission of HEV was derived. Using these significant predictors, the probability of vertical transmission of HEV was effectively stratified in the validation group, with P > .05 indicating non-significance.

In conclusion, viral load was associated with vertical transmission of HEV infection. A valid prediction score model was generated and verified in a validation cohort group.

### Burden of hepatitis E virus infection in pregnancy and maternofoetal outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1161uw3M]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). High credibility.

The present findings suggest a high burden of HEV infection in pregnancy in high endemic countries, its association with poor maternal and foetal outcomes, and a high rate of vertical transmission. As such, this study supports the need for specific strategies to prevent exposure of pregnant women to HEV infection, especially in resource-limited settings, areas where HEV outbreaks are more likely to occur, and in HEV high endemic areas. The widespread use of hepatitis E vaccine among pregnant women in these settings and areas should be explored. Moreover, further studies are needed to identify plausible causal pathways for a better description of the association between HEV infection and poor maternal and foetal outcomes.

### Safety and effectiveness of a recombinant hepatitis E vaccine in women of childbearing age in rural Bangladesh: a phase 4, double-blind, cluster-randomised, controlled trial [^1125HpGC]. The Lancet Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) leads to high mortality in pregnant women in low-income countries. We aimed to evaluate the safety of an HEV vaccine and its effectiveness in preventing hepatitis E during pregnancy.

- **Methods**: In this phase 4, double-blind, cluster-randomised trial, 67 villages in Matlab, Bangladesh, were randomised 1:1 to receive HEV239 (a recombinant HEV vaccine) or a control vaccine (Hepa-B, a hepatitis B vaccine) using block randomisation with random number tables and blocks of size eight, stratified by cluster population size. Eligible non-pregnant women (aged 16–39 years) were vaccinated intramuscularly on day 0, at 1 month, and at 6 months, and followed up for 2 years after the last immunisation. The primary endpoint was hepatitis E in the pregnant, per-protocol population (those who received all three doses within 2 days of the scheduled dates), while safety was a secondary endpoint, assessed in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (participants who received at least one dose). Solicited adverse events were recorded for the first 7 days after each dose, and unsolicited events until 2 years following a participant's final dose. Pregnancy-related safety outcomes were assessed in the pregnant ITT population.

- **Findings**: Between Oct 2, 2017, and Feb 28, 2019, 19,460 participants were enrolled and received either HEV239 (9,478 [48.7%] participants, 33 clusters) or Hepa-B (9,982 [51.3%] participants, 34 clusters), of whom 17,937 (92.2%) participants received three doses and 17,613 (90.5%) were vaccinated according to protocol.

### Seroepidemiology of hepatitis E virus infection in an urban population in Zambia: Strong association with HIV and environmental enteropathy [^112DAX2M]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection causes major epidemics of infectious hepatitis, with high mortality rates in pregnant women. Recent reports indicate that HEV coinfections with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may have a more protracted course. However, the impact of HEV infections in communities heavily affected by HIV remains poorly studied. We set out to examine age-related seroprevalence in a community where we have previously carried out studies on environmental enteropathy.

- **Methods**: Blood samples from 194 children and 106 adults were examined for immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M antibodies for HEV. HEV data were correlated with HIV status and morphometric analysis of small intestinal biopsies.

- **Results**: Seroprevalence rose throughout childhood, from 8% in children aged 1–4 years to 36% in children aged 10–14 years. In adults, the overall prevalence was 42%, with 28% in HIV-seronegative adults and 71% in HIV-seropositive adults (odds ratio, 6.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.2–18; p = 0.0001). In adults, villous height and crypt depth measurements showed that HEV seropositivity was associated with worse enteropathy (P = 0.05 and P = 0.005, respectively).

- **Conclusions**: HEV infection is common in Zambia. In adults, it is strongly associated with HIV status and also with environmental enteropathy.

### Genotype specific pathogenicity of hepatitis E virus at the human maternal-fetal interface [^116cthzE]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection, particularly HEV genotype 1 (HEV-1), can result in fulminant hepatic failure and severe placental diseases. However, mechanisms underlying genotype-specific pathogenicity remain unclear and appropriate models are lacking. Here, we model HEV-1 infection ex vivo at the maternal-fetal interface using the decidua basalis and fetal placenta, comparing its effects to the less pathogenic genotype 3 (HEV-3). We demonstrate that HEV-1 replicates more efficiently than HEV-3 in both tissue explants and stromal cells, produces more infectious progeny virions, and causes severe tissue alterations. HEV-1 infection dysregulates the secretion of several soluble factors. These alterations to the cytokine microenvironment correlate with viral load and contribute to tissue damage. Collectively, this study characterizes an ex vivo model for HEV infection and provides insights into HEV-1 pathogenesis during pregnancy, linked to high viral replication, alteration of the local secretome, and induction of tissue injuries.

### Viral hepatitis in pregnancy [^112sJHD6]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Low credibility.

Viral hepatitis during pregnancy requires special management depending on the types of the viruses (hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E), the epidemiology of the virus, its chronicity, the presence of liver complications, as well as the availability of successful antiviral therapies. During viral hepatitis in pregnancy, considerable immunopathogenic effects may occur on the liver of both the mothers and the infants. Hepatitis A and hepatitis E represent the greatest risk for the mothers and infants among the viral hepatitis infections, potentially altering the outcome of pregnancy and the health of newly born infants. However, with HBV and HCV, the main effects are related to the underlying maternal liver diseases and the potential transmission of the virus to the infants. This review discusses the pathogenesis of acute and chronic viral hepatitis infection during pregnancy, their effect on the outcome of pregnancy, as well as the influence of the viral infection on maternal and infant outcomes.

### Antibodies to hepatitis E in Portuguese mothers and their newborns [^117V3TU4]. Journal of Medical Virology (2013). Low credibility.

The high mortality of pregnant women is one of the main features of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection in endemic countries. With the emergence of genotype 3 HEV in industrialized countries, attention should be given to pregnant women from these regions, as the effect of genotype 3 HEV in pregnancy is not yet known. In this study, archived sera dating from 1993 from mothers with no history of traveling to HEV endemic countries and their newborns were tested for anti-HEV IgG antibodies. Four of the 12 maternal sera were positive for IgG anti-HEV, indicating exposure to this virus. Their newborns were also positive, showing higher anti-HEV IgG levels. Overall, these findings demonstrate not only an efficient transplacental transport of anti-HEV IgG but also circulation of autochthonous HEV in Portugal in the early 1990s.

### Viral hepatitis and pregnancy [^114MHBEe]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

The management of viral hepatitis in the setting of pregnancy requires special consideration. There are five liver-specific viruses (hepatitis A, B, C, D, E), each with unique epidemiology, tendency to chronicity, risk of liver complications, and response to antiviral therapies. In the setting of pregnancy, the liver health of the mother, the influence of pregnancy on the clinical course of the viral infection, and the effect of the virus or liver disease on the developing infant must be considered. Although all hepatitis viruses can harm the mother and the child, the greatest risk to maternal health and, subsequently, the fetus is seen with acute hepatitis A virus or hepatitis E virus infection during pregnancy.

By contrast, the primary risks for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis D virus are related to the severity of the underlying liver disease in the mother and the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) for HBV and HCV. The prevention of MTCT is key to reducing the global burden of chronic viral hepatitis, and prevention strategies must take into consideration local health-care and socioeconomic challenges. This review presents the epidemiology of acute and chronic viral hepatitis infection in pregnancy, the effect of pregnancy on the course of viral infection and, conversely, the influence of the viral infection on maternal and infant outcomes, including MTCT.

### First case report of an acute genotype 3 hepatitis E infected pregnant woman living in south-eastern France [^112ZkKyJ]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2012). Low credibility.

In European countries, the epidemiology of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is not well known. Although the seroprevalence of HEV Immunoglobulin G reaches a few percent in European women, no acute hepatitis E during pregnancy has been described so far. Here, we report a case of an autochthonous HEV genotype 3 infection in a 41-year-old pregnant woman living in a non-endemic country. The acute hepatitis had a spontaneously good outcome for both the mother and the child. In non-endemic areas where hepatitis E infections are emerging, unexplained cytolysis, regardless of its level, in a pregnant woman could be investigated for HEV using biological molecular and serology tools.

### Burden of hepatitis E virus infection in pregnancy and maternofoetal outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11127riY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Low credibility.

To estimate the prevalence of hepatitis E virus (HEV), a total of 13,153 pregnant women were included in the meta-analysis for global prevalence and vertical transmission of HEV infection.

All data on symptomatic women were sourced solely from countries with high HEV endemicity. In the case of asymptomatic women, 14 studies were from high endemic regions, 3 from endemic regions, and 4 from non-endemic countries. The prevalence of HEV infection was 49.6% (95% CI: 42.6–56.7) among symptomatic women (Figure 1) and 3.5% (95% CI: 1.4–6.4) among asymptomatic pregnant women (Figure 2), with substantial heterogeneity (p < 0.0001). Funnel plots indicated no asymmetry, as confirmed by the Egger test.

	- **Figure 2**: Meta-analysis of IgM seroprevalence of HEV infection among asymptomatic pregnant women.

- **Table 1**: Meta-analysis prevalence of hepatitis E virus infection in the global population of pregnant women.

The human development index (HDI) did not show a difference in HEV prevalence for asymptomatic women. There was no data on symptomatic women from countries with a high HDI.

In a univariable meta-regression analysis, HEV prevalence was associated with clinical presentation (R²: 76.1%), year of publication (R²: 9.8%), HDI (R²: 24.6%), WHO regions (65.3%), and the HEV endemic profile of countries (R²: 0.0%). In the final multivariable model, two variables were included: clinical profile and year of publication, explaining the variance.

### Hepatitis E autochthonous infection in chronic liver disease [^1135U8Bv]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Hepatitis E virus is endemic in many parts of the developing world and causes a self-limiting hepatitis in young adults, except in pregnant women and patients with chronic liver disease, where the mortality is high. Locally acquired hepatitis E is increasingly recognized in the developed world. It is caused by hepatitis E virus genotype 3, affects the middle-aged and the elderly, and may be a zoonotic infection from pigs. We present a case of locally acquired hepatitis E infection in a patient with previously undiagnosed cirrhosis, which resulted in subacute liver failure and death. We describe our attempt to trace this infection to a free-range pig farm adjacent to the patient's place of employment. Hepatitis E infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with decompensated chronic liver disease, whatever their age or travel history. When found, the prognosis may be poor.

### Genotype specific pathogenicity of hepatitis E virus at the human maternal-fetal interface [^113Vm9um]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a single-stranded, positive polarity RNA virus that belongs to the Hepeviridae family. Human cases of hepatitis E are caused by Orthohepevirus A species, which comprises eight genotypes. Genotypes 1 and 2 are obligate human pathogens transmitted by the fecal-oral route and have been associated with large outbreaks and epidemics in developing countries. Genotypes 3, 4, and 7 are responsible for sporadic cases of zoonotic hepatitis E, primarily in industrialized countries.

HEV infection is usually asymptomatic or causes acute self-limiting illness. In countries with poor sanitation, HEV-1 infection during pregnancy often results in fulminant hepatic failure (FHF, in 15–30% of cases) associated with severe placental diseases, including eclampsia, hemorrhage, membrane rupture, spontaneous abortion, and stillbirths. These fatal outcomes resemble those reported for other harmful pathogens during pregnancy and can be attributed to dysfunctions at the maternal-fetal interface composed of the pregnant endometrium lining or decidua basalis (decidua), and fetal placenta. In western countries where genotype 3 (HEV-3) prevails, HEV infection is rather harmless during pregnancy.

The objective of this study was to examine the presence of hepatitis E viremia in neonates with congenital infections.

- **Methods**: We included 29 neonates with clinical signs and symptoms suggesting congenital infections, along with their mothers. The control group comprised 29 healthy neonates and their mothers. Laboratory evaluations were performed for each sample to assess liver function profiles and conduct virological studies for hepatitis viruses B, C, and E.

- **Results**: The most common viral markers in mothers were for hepatitis C immunoglobulin G (IgG) (41%), followed by hepatitis B surface antigen (34%) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) IgG (31%). The most common presentations in neonates were respiratory distress syndrome, followed by preterm birth and signs of sepsis (both 41%), and hepatosplenomegaly (13%).

- **Conclusions**: This study highlights the occurrence of HEV infection among other etiological conditions causing congenital infections. Vertical transmission from mothers was common in our patients. Although HEV often ran a milder course, more studies are needed.

### Burden of hepatitis E virus infection in pregnancy and maternofoetal outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116mBaG4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Low credibility.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the burden of HEV infection in pregnancy. Our main findings indicate a high burden of HEV infection among pregnant women, particularly those who are symptomatic. Moreover, HEV in pregnancy is associated with a two- to three-fold increase in intrauterine foetal demise, a three-fold increase in poor intrauterine foetal maturity, and a significant increase in maternal mortality. Furthermore, HEV prevalence has decreased over time among pregnant women.

Previous modeling studies utilizing a Global Burden of Disease approach estimated HEV seroprevalence in the general population aged 15 to 45 years (childbearing age for women) to be between 5% and 22%. Our findings among pregnant women are consistent with these estimates. Available evidence suggests that, apart from non-infectious causes, hepatitis E is a significant cause of jaundice during pregnancy as pregnant women are more vulnerable to HEV infection than to other viral hepatitis infections (A, B, and C). The high IgM seroprevalence (almost 50%) of HEV infection in symptomatic women may be attributed to the fact that all studies included in this analysis were from HEV endemic areas. We observed that higher HEV infection prevalence was associated with a low Human Development Index (HDI), although without a significant difference. HEV infection predominantly impacts resource-limited settings with poor sanitation and hygiene services, leading to water and food contamination. Indeed, HEV infection is known as a disease of financial, educational, and infrastructural challenges.

The study aimed to explore the spectrum, clinical, and biochemical progression of viral hepatitis E during pregnancy. In this prospective study, sera from 62 pregnant women with jaundice in the third trimester were analyzed for markers of hepatitis A, B, C, and E viruses. The cord blood samples of hepatitis E virus (HEV)-positive pregnant women at the time of delivery were tested for IgM anti-HEV antibodies through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and HEV-RNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.

The results indicated that 45.2% of the patients had HEV infection, with nine developing fulminant hepatic failure (FHF). HEV was responsible for 81% of FHF cases and 37.25% of acute viral hepatitis cases. Approximately two-thirds of the pregnant women with HEV infection had preterm deliveries, and the mortality rate among HEV-positive pregnant women was 26.9%. Vertical transmission occurred in 33.3% of cases.

The study concluded that one-third of the pregnant women with HEV infection experienced severe hepatitis in the third trimester, specifically FHF. Hepatitis E during pregnancy is associated with high rates of preterm labor and mortality.

### Viral hepatitis in pregnancy [^113HYxAw]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Low credibility.

Acute and chronic HBV infection during and after pregnancy is a significant concern. The development of acute hepatitis is occasionally observed during pregnancy, with HBV infection being part of the differential diagnosis. Non-immune patients with risk exposures such as sexual contact or blood exposure present symptoms similar to those in non-pregnant individuals. However, diagnosis could be delayed as symptoms like nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and abdominal discomfort may be attributed to pregnancy or conditions like hyperemesis gravidarum in the first trimester. Pregnancy alters immune function and associated liver injury. Thus, chronic inactive and non-replicative HBV infection in a pregnant woman is linked with an increased risk of HBV flare, typically characterized by elevated ALT and HBV DNA levels. Flares have been reported in over 10% of women with chronic hepatitis B, with the risk significantly increasing during the postpartum period. Although ALT levels can be significant, most flares are relatively mild, with few progressing to hepatic decompensation. Jaundice can occur, but the process is generally self-limited. When flares occur, other aetiologies, including coinfection with hepatitis A, C, D, or E and drug toxicity, should be considered as they can be misinterpreted as flares of HBV.

The linkage between HBV infection and other maternal complications of pregnancy, including eclampsia, preterm labor, and the development of gestational diabetes, is uncertain. However, some studies support these associations.

### Duration of hepatitis E viremia in pregnancy [^115WCTTg]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2010). Low credibility.

To investigate the duration of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection in pregnant and non-pregnant women with acute viral hepatitis (AVH) or fulminant hepatic failure (FHF), a prospective study was conducted. The study included 20 pregnant women with AVH, 20 non-pregnant women with AVH, 10 pregnant women with FHF, and 9 non-pregnant women with FHF, all with HEV infection. The women were followed up on days 7, 15, 30, 60, and 90 following recruitment for the presence of HEV-RNA.

Of the 59 patients with HEV infection, only 2 (3.4%) revealed HEV viremia at day 30, and none of the patients were viremic at days 60 and 90. The proportion of HEV viremia in pregnant women with AVH and FHF at day 15 was significantly higher than in non-pregnant women (88.3% vs. 27.6%; P < 0.001). Similarly, HEV viremia among patients with AVH was significantly higher in pregnant women compared with non-pregnant women (100% vs. 55%; P < 0.001).

In conclusion, HEV viremia may be prolonged in pregnancy.

### Treatment and prevention of viral hepatitis in pregnancy [^1168wFMF]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Low credibility.

Viral hepatitis in pregnancy may be caused by many types of viruses that cause systemic infection or target hepatocytes in their pathogenesis. Because viral hepatitis during pregnancy may represent acute or chronic infection or the reactivation of a prior infection, a high clinical suspicion, medical history review, and awareness of risk factors for the acquisition of infection are important management principles.

The route of infection varies widely and ranges from fecal-oral transmission for the hepatitis A and E viruses to vertical transmission for hepatitis B, blood-borne transmission for hepatitis C, and sexual transmission for the herpes simplex virus. For this reason, the exposure details about travel, food preferences, drug use, and sexual contacts are important to elicit. Although routine prenatal screening is recommended for chronic viral hepatitis caused by hepatitis B and C, most other causes of viral hepatitis in pregnancy are detected in the setting of compatible signs and symptoms (fatigue, abdominal discomfort, jaundice, scleral icterus) or incidentally noted transaminitis on routine labs.

Serologic testing is helpful for diagnosis, with molecular testing as indicated to guide the management of hepatitis B and C. Preventive vaccines for hepatitis A and B with established safety of use in pregnancy are recommended for women who are at risk of acquisition. Post-exposure prophylaxis for hepatitis A is a single dose of immunoglobulin, and vaccination can be used if immunoglobulin G is not available. Antiviral therapy with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is recommended.

### Viral hepatitis in pregnancy [^111Tef3K]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Low credibility.

- **Introduction**: Hepatitis E virus is the most common cause of acute viral hepatitis (AVH) in many lesser-developed countries, particularly among young adults. Acute cases of hepatitis E virus (HEV) are not clinically distinguishable from other types of AVH. Asymptomatic infection is common. There are an estimated 20 million HEV infections worldwide, leading to an estimated 3.3 million symptomatic cases of hepatitis E. In Asia and Africa, there have been many large water-borne outbreaks of HEV-caused AVH. In the United States and developed countries, most of the infections are zoonotic.

Although most patients with HEV infections recover fully, mortality rates of 1–4% in the general population have been reported. HEV morbidity in pregnant women is variable according to the geographic regions. In the Indian subcontinent, the mortality rate may reach 20–40% among pregnant women with a high incidence of stillbirth and spontaneous abortion. In Egypt, despite high seroprevalence, morbidity is very low in HEV-infected pregnant women and their offspring. The reasons for these variations are still unknown.

### Hepatitis e: source and route of infection, clinical manifestations and new developments [^115twZvH]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2013). Low credibility.

Hepatitis E was previously thought to be a disease of developing countries, causing significant morbidity and mortality in young adults, particularly among pregnant women and patients with pre-existing chronic liver disease. Recent studies have shown that hepatitis E is also an issue in developed countries. In this setting, hepatitis E is a zoonotic infection and causes acute infection mainly in middle-aged and elderly men and chronic infection in the immunosuppressed. The scope and burden of disease are still emerging. The diagnosis of hepatitis E should be considered in any patient with hepatitis, irrespective of their age or travel history.

### Hepatitis E and pregnancy: Current state [^112x6QAF]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is responsible for more than 50% of acute viral hepatitis cases in endemic countries. Approximately 2 billion individuals live in hepatitis E-endemic areas and, therefore, are at risk of infection. According to the World Health Organization, HEV causes about 20.1 million infections and 70,000 deaths every year. In developing countries with poor sanitation, this disease is transmitted through contaminated water and is associated with large outbreaks, affecting hundreds or thousands of people. In developed countries, autochthonous cases of HEV have been increasingly recognized in the past several years.

Hepatitis E virus typically causes an acute, self-limiting illness similar to other acute viral hepatitis, such as hepatitis A or B, with about a 0.2% to 1% mortality rate in the general population. However, the course of hepatitis E in pregnancy is different from the mild self-constraining infection described in other populations. During pregnancy, HEV infection can take a fulminant course, resulting in fulminant hepatic failure, membrane rupture, spontaneous abortions, and stillbirths. Studies from various developing countries have shown a high incidence of HEV infection in pregnancy, with a significant proportion of pregnant women progressing to fulminant hepatitis with a fatality rate of up to 30%. This review will highlight new aspects of HEV infection and pregnancy.

		**Table 6: Summary of birth, breastfeeding, and other considerations for the management of hepatitis in pregnancy**.

		- **Hepatitis A virus**: Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is an RNA hepatovirus transmitted via the fecal-oral route. The clinical syndromes range from asymptomatic infection to liver failure. Diagnosis is made by serologic testing (HAV immunoglobulin G/immunoglobulin M). Elevated ALT, AST, and bilirubin levels are common, typically rising before symptom onset and resolving within 2–3 months. Maternal management is supportive. Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) is rare, but HAV infection, particularly in the second and third trimesters, is associated with increased rates of gestational complications and preterm labor.

		- **Vaccination**: HAV vaccination is recommended for pregnant women considered to be at high risk of infection, such as those traveling to endemic regions, homeless women, and those with HIV or chronic liver disease. Both the vaccine and immunoglobulin for post-exposure prophylaxis can be safely used in pregnancy.

### Viral hepatitis in pregnancy [^111jMcn1]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Low credibility.

- **Hepatitis E as a zoonotic infection**: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) or agents serologically related to HEV have been isolated from various animals including swine, sheep, rats, mice, chickens, donkeys, camels, and horses. The experimental transmission of HEV genotypes across different animal species is controversial. Humans are the primary host for genotypes 1 and 2, although certain species of primates may be co-primary hosts in some regions. Genotype 3 is highly endemic in swineherds in North America, Europe, and parts of Asia, with anti-HEV prevalence ranging from 60 to 100%. Genotype 3 has also been isolated from a few human cases of acute viral hepatitis (AVH) in industrialized countries and the United States.

	- In developing countries, both genotypes 1 and 3 coexist. Genotype 1 has been isolated from human cases of hepatitis E, while genotype 3 was recovered from swine. Additionally, isolation of HEV-RNA from two donkey serum samples during HEV outbreaks in the Darfur area in Sudan is noteworthy, implying that HEV infection of donkeys may also occur. Recently identified genotypes 5 and 6 were found in wild boars and are endemic mainly in Japan. Additionally, genotypes 7 and 8 were identified in the Middle East and China, affecting camels and humans.

- **Virulence of HEV genotypes**: Hepatitis E virus genotypes correlate with the severity of infection. Genotype 3 does not cause disease in swine and appears to be attenuated in experimentally infected primates. Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggests that genotypes 3 and 4 are less pathogenic in humans than genotype 1. During the HEV Darfur outbreak, the number of…

### Autochthonous hepatitis E during pregnancy, France [^117B2W1o]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

In low-income countries, estimates of 20 million hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections and 70,000 deaths have been reported for 2005. An increased mortality rate in pregnant women is well described but unexplained; pregnant women with symptomatic HEV infection have a 10-fold higher probability of death, especially in countries of the Indian subcontinent and Africa, where genotypes 1 and 2 are prevalent. In addition, up to 50% mother-to-child transmission rates have been reported, resulting in both premature births and prenatal deaths. In high-income countries with high seroprevalence rates, infection is usually asymptomatic. Most symptomatic cases are caused by HEV genotype 3; illness ranges from mild to fulminant acute hepatitis, as well as chronic hepatitis in immunocompromised patients. No increased severity has been observed in the few cases reported during pregnancy.

We report two infections acquired during pregnancy in immunocompetent women in France, neither of whom reported having traveled abroad or eaten raw or undercooked pork. In accordance with hospital policy, patients were informed at hospital admission of the potential use of their anonymized medical data for research purposes.

The first case-patient was a 43-year-old woman, hospitalized at 39 weeks 2 days' gestation, who had nausea, headache, and increased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Hepatitis led to a cervical ripening and labor induction on the next day. At 39 weeks 5 days' gestation, she delivered a 3,040-g healthy baby. We diagnosed maternal HEV infection at admission by detectable Ig.

### Burden of hepatitis E virus infection in pregnancy and maternofoetal outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116SgJCB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Low credibility.

In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a global strategy to halt the transmission of viral hepatitis, advocating that individuals living with viral hepatitis should have access to safe, affordable, and effective prevention, care, and treatment services. Specifically, by 2030, the aims are to reduce the number of new hepatitis cases by 90% and to treat 80% of eligible individuals infected with viral hepatitis to reduce hepatitis-related deaths by 65%. Globally, it was estimated that about 1.34 million deaths in 2015 were due to viral hepatitis, with 95% attributable to chronic hepatitis B and C infections, and the remainder to hepatitis A and E infections. In the specific case of hepatitis E infection, global estimates suggest that about 20 million new cases of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections occur each year, 3.3 million of which are symptomatic. In 2015, WHO reported approximately 44,000 fatal cases of HEV, accounting for about 3.3% of all viral hepatitis-related mortality.

HEV is a water- and food-borne infection that can potentially cause acute outbreaks in populations with poor sanitation. However, zoonotic and transfusion-related transmissions have also been documented. At the time of writing, no specific treatment exists for HEV infection; consequently, its management relies mostly on supportive care. On the other hand, prevention focuses on reducing exposure through improved sanitation, safe food and drinking water, and vaccination. Compared to hepatitis B and C, HEV infection is less likely to result in chronic liver disease.

### Epidemiology and outcomes of hepatitis E virus-associated hospitalisations in the United States with a focus on pregnancy: A nationwide population study, 1998–2020 [^113BuHmY]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2024). High credibility.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is typically asymptomatic in developed countries but can be more severe in certain populations. This study describes the epidemiology of HEV-associated hospitalisations from 1998 to 2020 in the United States, investigates risk factors for inpatient mortality, and examines outcomes in pregnant women.

Data were extracted from the National Inpatient Sample using ICD-9/10 diagnostic codes. Demographic, clinical, and pregnancy data were analyzed using chi-square and logistic regression. We identified 3,354 cases of HEV-associated hospitalisations; 1,689 (50.4%) were female and 1,425 (42.5%) were non-Hispanic White. The median age was 50 (IQR: 37–59) years.

Hospitalisation rates for HEV ranged from 2.5 per 10,000,000 in 2008 to a peak of 9.6 per 10,000,000 people in the general U.S. population in 2004. The mortality rate was 5.2%.

- **Risk factors**:
	- Age ≥ 40 years (OR: 7.73; 95% CI: 1.57–38.09; p = 0.012), HIV infection (OR: 4.63; 95% CI: 1.26–16.97; p = 0.021), and coagulopathy (OR: 7.22; 95% CI: 2.81–18.57; p < 0.001) were associated with increased odds of mortality within the HEV cohort.

There were 226 pregnant women with HEV. Rates of maternal death, stillbirth, and preterm birth were similar between HEV and non-HEV pregnant cohorts. Hepatitis B and hepatitis C co-infection were significantly more common in the HEV pregnant cohort (p < 0.05). HEV-associated hospitalisations are uncommon in the United States but likely underdiagnosed. Certain risk factors can be used to predict the prognosis of these hospitalised patients. Pregnant women with co-infections require particular attention in clinical settings.

Regarding specific circumstances for hepatitis B virus infection, particularly concerning pregnant patients, the SOGC 2017 guidelines recommend considering antiviral therapy. It should be initiated at 28–32 weeks of gestation and continued until delivery, in collaboration with an adult infectious disease/gastroenterology or hepatology specialist. This approach is advised to prevent perinatal transmission in patients with hepatitis B DNA viral loads exceeding 200,000 IU/mL (> 10⁶ copies/mL).

### Burden of hepatitis E virus infection in pregnancy and maternofoetal outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115MQG5S]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Low credibility.

There is still a dearth of knowledge on the burden of HEV infection in the global population of pregnant women; therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the global burden of HEV infection in pregnancy.

- **Methods**: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Knowledge, and Global Index Medicus to identify articles published until January 26, 2020. We considered cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies reporting the immunoglobulins M HEV seroprevalence in asymptomatic and symptomatic (jaundice or elevated transaminases) pregnant women or investigating the association between HEV infection and maternofoetal outcomes. We used a random-effects model to pool studies. This review was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018093820.

- **Results**: For HEV prevalence estimates, we included 52 studies (11,663 pregnant women). The seroprevalence was 3.5% (95% confidence interval: 1.4–6.4) in asymptomatic women, most of whom were from high endemic areas. The prevalence in symptomatic women was 49.6% (42.6–56.7) with data only from HEV high endemic countries. In the multivariable meta-regression model, the prevalence was higher in symptomatic women compared to asymptomatic women (adjusted prevalence odds ratio [aPOR]: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.61–1.91) and decreased with increasing year of publication (by 10-year) (aPOR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.84–0.96). The proportion of HEV vertical transmission was 36.9% (13.3–64.2). Risk of bias was assessed as low, moderate, and high in 12 (23%), 37 (70%), and 4 studies (7%) addressing HEV prevalence estimation, respectively. HEV infection was associated with m.

### Low prevalence of hepatitis E infection among pregnant women in Madrid, Spain [^116VdK9M]. Journal of Medical Virology (2010). Low credibility.

Hepatitis E virus, a cause of sporadic hepatitis in developed countries, is present in Spain. The aims of this study were to determine whether the prevalence of IgG anti-hepatitis E virus antibodies has increased in recent years in Spain and to assess the prevalence in a study population at risk of developing the disease following the infection. Serum samples from 1,040 women in the first trimester of pregnancy were studied. The prevalence rate of 3.6% has not increased significantly since 1999 despite the large number of immigrants from endemic regions. IgM anti-HEV antibodies were detected in 0.67% of the patients, suggesting that although subclinical infection exists, the prevalence is very low. The reasons for the differences in the morbidity of HEV in pregnant women in different geographical areas remain unclear. Good hygienic measures and public health conditions are important factors for ensuring a low prevalence of hepatitis E in Spain.

### High mortality associated with an outbreak of hepatitis E among displaced persons in Darfur, Sudan [^114acHvj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes an acute onset of jaundice and a high case-fatality ratio in pregnant women. This study provides a clinical description of hospitalized case patients and assesses the specific impact on pregnant women during a large epidemic of HEV infection in a displaced population in the Mornay camp, with a population of 78,800, located in western Darfur, Sudan.

- **Methods**: We reviewed hospital records, with a sample of 20 clinical cases undergoing laboratory confirmation. These patients were tested for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to HEV (serum) and for amplification of the HEV genome (serum and stool). We performed a cross-sectional survey in the community to determine the attack rate and case-fatality ratio in pregnant women.

- **Results**: Over six months, 253 HEV cases were recorded at the hospital, of which 61 (24.1%) were in pregnant women. A total of 72 cases (39.1% of those for whom clinical records were available) were diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy. Of the 45 who died (case-fatality ratio, 17.8%), 19 were pregnant women (specific case-fatality ratio, 31.1%). Acute hepatitis E was confirmed in 95% (19/20) of cases sampled; 18 case-patients were positive for IgG (optical density ratio ≥ 3), for IgM (optical density ratio > 2), or both, while 1 was negative for IgG and IgM but positive for HEV RNA in serum. The survey identified 220 jaundiced women among the 1,133 pregnant women recorded over three months (attack rate, 19.4%). A total of 18 deaths were recorded among these jaundiced pregnant women (specific case-fatality ratio, 8.2%).

- **Conclusions**: The data underscores the severe impact of the HEV outbreak, particularly on pregnant women in the Mornay camp in Darfur, Sudan.

This systematic review was registered in the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews under registration number CRD42018093820. We utilized the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines to report this review.

- **Search strategy and selection criteria**: We conducted a comprehensive search of major electronic databases, including MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, and Global Index Medicus, to identify relevant studies on HEV infection in pregnant women. The search strategy was tailored to each database, with an example provided for PubMed (Supplementary Table 1). Studies published up to January 26, 2020, without language or country restrictions, were considered. References of relevant studies were screened for additional potential inclusions.

- **Study selection**: Two review authors (AF and SK) independently screened titles and abstracts of citations retrieved from the electronic search. Full texts of potentially eligible articles were further assessed. Disagreements were resolved through discussion, and a third author (JJB) provided input if consensus was not reached.

- **Inclusion and exclusion criteria**: Cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies were included. Excluded were letters, reviews, commentaries, editorials, and studies lacking primary data. Studies with participants selected based on other viral hepatitis infections or HIV, or with incomplete methodology descriptions, were also excluded.

### Seroprevalence of hepatitis E virus among pregnant women and control subjects in China [^116VrfMn]. Journal of Medical Virology (2015). Low credibility.

Hepatitis E infection, caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV), is an important global public health concern, particularly due to high mortality rates in pregnant women. China is generally considered an HEV-endemic area; however, epidemiological data for HEV among pregnant women are limited. Between June 2011 and July 2013, a case-control study was conducted to estimate the seroprevalence and potential risk factors associated with the acquisition of HEV infection by pregnant women in China.

Nine hundred and ninety pregnant women, who visited hospitals in Qingdao and Weihai for antenatal follow-up or medication, and 965 control subjects matched by age, gender, and residence were examined for the presence of anti-HEV IgG and IgM antibodies using enzyme immunoassays. Socio-demographic and behavioral characteristics of the study subjects were obtained. The overall prevalence of anti-HEV IgG in all 1,955 samples was 20.7%. In pregnant women, 16.2% of samples were anti-HEV IgG positive, whereas in control subjects, 25.3% of samples were anti-HEV IgG positive (P < 0.01). For anti-HEV IgM detection, 62 (3.2%) of the 1,955 serum samples were positive; the seroprevalence in pregnant women and control subjects was 2.6% and 3.6%, respectively. Age, contact with cats, contact with pigs, and exposure to soil were found to be associated with HEV infection. These findings demonstrate the high prevalence of HEV and the considerable potential for HEV transmission in pregnant women in China.

### Burden of hepatitis E virus infection in pregnancy and maternofoetal outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115s82dj]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Low credibility.

Narrative reviews suggested that HEV infection during pregnancy is a risk factor for poor maternal and foetal outcomes, particularly at a later stage of pregnancy. Although the physiopathology of HEV infection in pregnancy and its outcomes is not yet clear, it is possible that an interplay exists between hormonal changes (reduced oestrogen and progesterone receptor expression) and immunologic changes (suppression of T cell-mediated immunity to maintain the antigenic foetus in the maternal environment) during pregnancy, alongside a high HEV viral load.

Physiological changes in this hormonal and immunologic interplay, which should normally favour pregnancy evolution, become deleterious to both the foetus and the mother, affecting all stages of foetal growth and maturity. For foetal non-survival, only miscarriage was not associated with HEV infection. At the beginning of pregnancy, the interplay between these changes and the presence of HEV may not significantly increase the risk of miscarriage. During the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, the plasma concentration of cytokines begins to decrease. This gradual decrease leads to low plasma cytokine levels in late pregnancy, resulting in decreased immunity. This may explain why HEV infection is associated with a higher risk of poor foetal outcomes in late pregnancy.

### The two faces of hepatitis E virus [^116tQ43A]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) has at least two distinct epidemiological profiles: (1) large outbreaks and epidemics in developing countries, usually caused by HEV genotype 1, resulting in high morbidity and mortality among pregnant women and young children, and (2) very few symptomatic cases of HEV genotype 3. Most cases lack symptoms or a clear source of infection, yet there is frequent seroreactivity in 5%-21% of asymptomatic persons in developed countries.

We urge more epidemiological studies and public health interventions, including the promotion and development of existing and future vaccine candidates. There is also a pressing need for the availability of US Food and Drug Administration-approved serological assays for this underappreciated and poorly understood virus, a major cause of disease throughout the world.

### Risk factors and seroprevalence of hepatitis E evaluated in frozen-serum samples (2002–2003) of pregnant women compared with female blood donors in a southern region of Brazil [^117KZksQ]. Journal of Medical Virology (2018). Low credibility.

Hepatitis E has always been related to morbidity in pregnant women, yet its epidemiology is not well understood in Brazil. Therefore, we tested sera from 209 pregnant women and 199 female blood donors, collected at a single center in Curitiba, Brazil. The Wantai assay was used for testing the anti-hepatitis E virus (anti-HEV) immunoglobulin G (IgG), along with an in-house polymerase chain reaction process for testing HEV RNA. Anti-HEV was detected in 22.5% of the total group — 19% in the pregnant women group and 26% in the blood donor group (P = 0.11) — a much higher prevalence compared with other studies in Brazil.

Demographical analysis revealed that 92.4% were born in the South Region of Brazil, 4.9% in the Southeast, and 2.7% were from other regions of the country. Regarding their current location, 99% were residing in the South, 0.7% in the Southeast, and 0.2% in the Central-West regions. Factors such as income, education, race, number of pregnancies, and incidence of abortion did differ significantly when comparing both groups. Notably, age > 30 (P = 0.012) and having more than three pregnancies (P = 0.008) were related to anti-HEV positivity. All anti-HEV IgG-positive females were HEV RNA negative.

In conclusion, HEV positivity was found in one out of five young women, indicating an urgent need for further epidemiological studies in Brazil.

### Aetiology, clinical course and outcome of sporadic acute viral hepatitis in pregnancy [^112tD5sL]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2003). Low credibility.

Hepatitis E causes large-scale epidemics in endemic areas. During epidemics, the disease has increased incidence and severity in pregnant women. Sporadic acute viral hepatitis (AVH) is common in these regions, but the relationship between sporadic AVH and pregnancy has not been well studied. Over a 3-year period, we prospectively studied 76 pregnant women and 337 non-pregnant women of childbearing age with sporadic acute viral hepatitis to understand the aetiology, clinical course, and outcome of the disease.

The aetiology in sporadic AVH was as follows: hepatitis A virus (HAV) in six (1.5%) cases, hepatitis B virus (HBV) in 62 (15%), hepatitis C virus (HCV) in seven (1.7%), hepatitis D virus (HDV) co-infection in six (1.5%), hepatitis E virus (HEV) in 205 (49.6%), and hepatitis non-A-to-E (HNAE) in 127 (30.7%). Sixty-five (85.5%) pregnant women and 140 (41.5%) non-pregnant women had hepatitis E. The proportion of pregnant women was 31.7% in the HEV group and 5.3% in the non-HEV group [P < 0.001; OR = 8.3 (95% CI: 4.2–16.3)].

The prevalence of HEV in pregnant women across different stages was as follows: first trimester (76.9%), second trimester (88.9%), third trimester (83.8%), and puerperium (100%), with no significant difference (P = 0.09). Forty-seven (61.8%) of the 76 pregnant women developed fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) — 69.2% in the HEV group and 10% in the non-HEV group (P < 0.001). Meanwhile, 34 (10.1%) non-pregnant women developed FHF — 10% in the HEV group and 9.7% in the non-HEV group (P = 0.86). FHF occurred in 40% (four out of 10) of patients with HE in the first trimester, compared to 74.5% (41 out of 55) of patients in the second trimester and beyond (P = 0.015).
