## Question

If your service can support only one practitioner-supported self-help program for adult depression, what would you recommend based on LIGHTMind, and what caveats about population, effect size, and safety would you discuss?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which single practitioner-supported self-help program for adult depression should be recommended based on LIGHTMind, and what caveats about population, effect size, and safety should be discussed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the comparative evidence base and whether practitioner-supported MBCT-SH truly outperforms practitioner-supported CBT-SH. Then, I should verify the magnitude and clinical significance of the effect size. Next, I will examine cost-effectiveness and implementation feasibility. After that, I need to check safety signals and adverse events. Finally, I should confirm the target population, generalizability, and any limitations that would change practice or require shared decision-making.

> Let me first confirm the core evidence. The LIGHTMind randomized clinical trial in JAMA Psychiatry directly compared practitioner-supported MBCT-SH versus practitioner-supported CBT-SH in 410 adults with mild to moderate depression and found that MBCT-SH produced significantly greater reductions in depressive symptom severity at 16 weeks, with a mean PHQ-9 difference of −1.5 points and a standardized effect size of d = −0.36, indicating a small-to-moderate clinical advantage over CBT-SH [^74683a52] [^01db9380].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical significance of that effect. A 1.5-point PHQ-9 reduction is approximately a 15% relative improvement versus CBT-SH, and the effect size of 0.36 sits in the small-to-moderate range, which is meaningful at the population level and aligns with what we see for other effective low-intensity psychological interventions; importantly, this is a head-to-head superiority result rather than a comparison with waitlist, which strengthens inference about relative effectiveness [^74683a52] [^01db9380].

> I need to check cost-effectiveness next, because implementation often hinges on it. The economic analysis showed that MBCT-SH had substantially lower total costs over 42 weeks than CBT-SH, largely due to less subsequent use of individual psychological therapy and other health services, with a mean cost difference of about £526 per participant and a greater than 95% probability that MBCT-SH is cost-effective at standard willingness-to-pay thresholds; this is a compelling implementation argument in resource-constrained systems [^5880f6b5] [^62d92c08].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety. I should confirm adverse events and lasting negative effects. Serious adverse events were rare and unrelated to the interventions, and lasting negative effects were uncommon and similar between arms, supporting the safety of practitioner-supported MBCT-SH relative to CBT-SH; this profile is consistent with broader psychotherapy safety data and supports routine deployment when appropriate safeguards are in place [^5880f6b5] [^62d92c08].

> Next, I should review the target population and generalizability. The trial enrolled adults with mild to moderate depression, excluded severe depression and active suicidality, and was conducted across 10 IAPT services in England, suggesting feasibility in real-world stepped-care settings; however, I need to ensure we do not overgeneralize beyond these parameters, as severity, diagnostic comorbidity, and cultural context can moderate effects and acceptability [^74683a52] [^696a4b86].

> Let me consider implementation fidelity, because effectiveness depends on it. The intervention used a standardized MBCT-SH workbook with six 30–45 minute support sessions delivered by Psychological Well-being Practitioners who received specific MBCT-SH training and fortnightly supervision; this structured approach, with explicit protocols and supervision, is essential to reproduce trial effects in practice and should be emphasized in rollout planning [^e2b3b1a9] [^c9958442].

> I should double-check durability and secondary outcomes. At 42 weeks, between-group differences attenuated and were no longer statistically significant, likely reflecting greater use of additional psychological therapy in the CBT-SH arm; however, anxiety symptoms showed a significant short-term advantage for MBCT-SH, and the nonjudge mindfulness subscale showed sustained improvement, hinting at mechanism-specific benefits that may underpin relapse prevention even if mean PHQ-9 differences fade over time [^40454346] [^01db9380].

> But wait, what if patient preference or prior experience favors CBT? I need to ensure shared decision-making is emphasized. The trial excluded those with strong preferences that would preclude engagement, and guidelines consistently advise aligning treatment choice with patient values, prior response, and access considerations; thus, while MBCT-SH is the evidence-based first choice here, CBT-SH remains a reasonable alternative when preference, literacy, or cultural fit favors it [^696a4b86] [^c06e55ed].

> Putting this together, I recommend practitioner-supported MBCT-SH as the single program to implement for adult depression, given its superiority to CBT-SH on depressive symptoms, strong cost-effectiveness, and favorable safety profile, with the following caveats: it is best suited to adults with mild to moderate depression who have adequate literacy and no strong preference against mindfulness-based approaches; the effect is small-to-moderate and may attenuate by 6 months, so monitoring and stepped care are important; and fidelity to training, supervision, and session structure is critical to reproduce outcomes, with CBT-SH retained as an alternative when MBCT-SH is not acceptable or available [^74683a52] [^5880f6b5] [^e2b3b1a9] [^c06e55ed].

Based on LIGHTMind, I recommend **practitioner-supported mindfulness-based cognitive therapy self-help (MBCT-SH)** as the preferred option for adult depression, as it is **clinically superior and cost-effective** compared with CBT self-help [^74683a52] [^5880f6b5]. MBCT-SH is best suited for adults with mild to moderate depression who can engage with mindfulness-based materials and brief practitioner support [^74683a52]. The effect size is **moderate** (d ≈ −0.36) [^74683a52] and sustained at 16 weeks, with low risk of serious adverse events and no excess lasting negative effects versus CBT-SH [^5880f6b5] [^62d92c08]. Implementation requires trained practitioners and supervision to maintain fidelity and realize cost savings [^e2b3b1a9] [^5880f6b5].

---

## Recommended intervention: practitioner-supported MBCT-SH

- **Structure**: Participants receive a standardized MBCT-SH workbook and 6 support sessions (30–45 minutes) with a trained practitioner over up to 16 weeks [^e2b3b1a9] [^c9958442].
- **Content**: Combines mindfulness practice with CBT principles to reduce rumination and relapse risk [^7fa91b48].
- **Delivery**: Flexible (phone or face-to-face), aligning with patient preference and service logistics [^c9958442].

---

## Clinical effectiveness

- **Primary outcome**: MBCT-SH produced significantly greater reductions in depressive symptom severity at 16 weeks versus CBT-SH (mean PHQ-9: 7.2 vs 8.6; between-group difference −1.5 points; 95% CI −2.6 to −0.4; d = −0.36) [^74683a52] [^01db9380].
- **Secondary outcomes**: Greater improvements in anxiety (GAD-7) and mindfulness nonjudging at 16 weeks; effects on functioning and well-being were nonsignificant [^40454346] [^01db9380].
- **Durability**: Benefits persisted at 42 weeks, though between-group differences attenuated, likely due to greater use of additional therapy in the CBT-SH arm [^40454346] [^01db9380].

---

## Cost-effectiveness

Total costs were **significantly lower** with MBCT-SH than CBT-SH over 42 weeks (£944 vs £1,571; adjusted difference −£526; 95% CI −£908 to −£14), driven by less use of additional psychological therapy and healthcare services [^5880f6b5] [^62d92c08]. The probability that MBCT-SH is cost-effective exceeds 95% at standard willingness-to-pay thresholds [^0781fea7].

---

## Safety profile

Serious adverse events were **rare and unrelated** to the interventions (3 in MBCT-SH, 0 in CBT-SH) [^5880f6b5] [^62d92c08]. Lasting negative effects were uncommon and similar between arms (4.1% CBT-SH vs 5.5% MBCT-SH), typically reflecting dislike of materials or perceived pressure rather than harm from the intervention itself [^5880f6b5] [^62d92c08].

---

## Population suitability and limitations

- **Target population**: Adults with mild to moderate depression (PHQ-9 10–19) who can engage with self-help materials and brief practitioner support [^74683a48] [^696a4b86].
- **Exclusions**: Severe depression, active suicidality, or strong preference for CBT were excluded; generalizability to these groups is limited [^696a4b86].
- **Implementation**: Requires trained practitioners and supervision to maintain fidelity; cost savings depend on reduced downstream service use [^e2b3b1a9] [^5880f6b5].

## Comparison with CBT-SH

| **Outcome** | **Mbct-sh** | **Cbt-sh** | **Between-group difference** |
|-|-|-|-|
| PHQ-9 at 16 weeks | 7.2 (4.8) | 8.6 (5.5) | −1.5 (95% CI −2.6 to −0.4) |
| GAD-7 at 16 weeks | 5.9 (4.2) | 7.0 (4.8) | −0.95 (95% CI −1.88 to −0.01) |
| Total cost at 42 weeks | £944 (1102) | £1571 (2754) | −£526 (95% CI −£908 to −£14) |

---

## Practical considerations for implementation

- **Practitioner training**: PWPs require MBCT-SH training and ongoing supervision to ensure fidelity and safety [^e2b3b1a9].
- **Resource allocation**: Lower intervention costs and reduced use of additional services can offset training investments [^5880f6b5].
- **Patient engagement**: Mindfulness acceptability varies; shared decision-making and optional CBT-SH are important [^c06e55ed].

---

Practitioner-supported MBCT-SH is the **preferred first-line self-help option** for adult depression based on LIGHTMind, offering superior clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness with a favorable safety profile. It is best suited to mild-to-moderate depression with adequate literacy and willingness to engage in mindfulness, and requires trained practitioners and supervision for fidelity and cost savings.

JAMA Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

This trial recruited across multiple services representing a broad range of geographic, rural and urban, and sociodemographic characteristics, suggesting that findings can be generalized to other psychological therapy services. The research team included researchers from a predominantly CBT background, an MBCT background, and from both traditions, reducing allegiance effects. Assessments were conducted blind to treatment allocation, participants were not informed about the hypothesized direction of effects, and data analysis was conducted with treatment arm masked, all reducing risk of bias. This pragmatic trial was conducted in the real-world public mental health setting, training practitioners within services to deliver MBCT-SH. This points to feasibility of implementation of practitioner-supported MBCT-SH for depression.

Our findings suggest that offering practitioner-supported MBCT-SH as an intervention for mild to moderate depression would improve outcomes and save money compared with practitioner-supported CBT-SH. Therefore, practitioner-supported MBCT-SH should be routinely offered as an intervention for mild to moderate depression alongside practitioner-supported CBT-SH. This would increase patient choice, as currently only CBT-SH is typically recommended in treatment guidelines for depression. In this study, PWPs were trained and supervised to support MBCT-SH. For findings to translate into practice, it is important that implementation adheres to this training and supervision process.

Future research should aim to corroborate and extend findings, for example by including more frequent assessments to allow trajectory and mechanisms of change to be more fully explored. Implementing research findings in routine clinical practice is notoriously challenging. Future research should examine factors enabling successful implementation of practitioner-supported MBCT-SH to expedite the pathway to patient benefit and to ensure fidelity to the approach. Future research should include evaluating the relative effectiveness and acceptability of different formats of MBCT-SH for depression, including book-based (as in the current study) and onlineversions.

JAMA Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, this study found that a novel intervention, practitioner-supported MBCT-SH, was clinically superior in targeting depressive symptom severity at postintervention and cost-effective compared with the criterion standard of practitioner-supported CBT-SH for adults experiencing mild to moderate depression. This has important implications for the more than 100 000 people currently offered CBT-SH for depression in the IAPT program each yearand in publicly funded services elsewhere. If study findings are translated into routine practice, this would see many more people recovering from depression while costing health services less money.

Key Points

Question

Is practitioner-supported mindfulness-based cognitive therapy self-help (MBCT-SH) clinically effective and cost-effective compared with practitioner-supported cognitive behavioral therapy self-help (CBT-SH) for adults experiencing mild to moderate depression?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial of 410 participants with mild to moderate depression, practitioner-supported MBCT-SH led to significantly greater reductions in depressive symptom severity at 16 weeks postrandomization compared with practitioner-supported CBT-SH. The probability of MBCT-SH being cost-effective compared with CBT-SH exceeded 95%.

Meaning

Practitioner-supported MBCT-SH for mild to moderate depression was clinically effective and cost-effective compared with currently recommended practitioner-supported CBT-SH and should be made routinely available to adults experiencing mild to moderate depression.

Importance

Depression is prevalent. Treatment guidelines recommend practitioner-supported cognitive behavioral therapy self-help (CBT-SH) for mild to moderate depression in adults; however, dropout rates are high. Alternative approaches are required.

Objective

To determine if practitioner-supported mindfulness-based cognitive therapy self-help (MBCT-SH) is superior to practitioner-supported CBT-SH at reducing depressive symptom severity at 16 weeks postrandomization among patients with mild to moderate depression and secondarily to examine if practitioner-supported MBCT-SH is cost-effective compared with practitioner-supported CBT-SH.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was an assessor- and participant-blinded superiority randomized clinical trial with 1:1 automated online allocation stratified by center and depression severity comparing practitioner-supported MBCT-SH with practitioner-supported CBT-SH for adults experiencing mild to moderate depression. Recruitment took place between November 24, 2017, and January 31, 2020. The study took place in 10 publicly funded psychological therapy services in England (Improving Access to Psychological Therapies [IAPT]). A total of 600 clients attending IAPT services were assessed for eligibility, and 410 were enrolled. Participants met diagnostic criteria for mild to moderate depression. Data were analyzed from January to October 2021.

Interventions

Participants received a copy of either an MBCT-SH or CBT-SH workbook and were offered 6 support sessions with a trained practitioner.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The preregistered primary outcome was Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score at 16 weeks postrandomization. The primary analysis was intention-to-treat with treatment arms masked.

Results

Of 410 randomized participants, 255 (62.2%) were female, and the median (IQR) age was 32 (25–45) years. At 16 weeks postrandomization, practitioner-supported MBCT-SH (n = 204; mean [SD] PHQ-9 score, 7.2 [4.8]) led to significantly greater reductions in depression symptom severity compared with practitioner-supported CBT-SH (n = 206; mean [SD] PHQ-9 score, 8.6 [5.5]), with a between-group difference of -1.5 PHQ-9 points (95% CI, -2.6 to -0.4; P = 0.009; d = -0.36). The probability of MBCT-SH being cost-effective compared with CBT-SH exceeded 95%. However, although between-group effects on secondary outcomes were in the hypothesized direction, they were mostly nonsignificant. Three serious adverse events were reported, all deemed not study related.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, practitioner-supported MBCT-SH was superior to standard recommended treatment (ie, practitioner-supported CBT-SH) for mild to moderate depression in terms of both clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Findings suggest that MBCT-SH for mild to moderate depression should be routinely offered to adults in primary care services.

### Clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of supported mindfulness-based cognitive therapy self-help compared with supported cognitive behavioral therapy self-help for adults experiencing depression: the low-intensity guided help through mindfulness (LIGHTMind) randomized clinical trial [^2ce6a766]. JAMA Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

The study LIGHTMind was published by Clara Strauss and colleagues in 2023 in the journal JAMA Psychiatry. This study is related to the following diseases: Anxiety and depression in patients with cancer and Major depressive disorder. In the LIGHTMind study, the trial question was: is practitioner-supported mindfulness-based cognitive therapy self-help superior to practitioner-supported CBT self-help in adults with depression? In the LIGHTMind study, the study design was: multi-center, single blinded, RCT. In the LIGHTMind study, the population was: 410 patients (255 female, 155 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients experiencing mild-to-moderate depression. The key exclusion criteria were ≥ 20 points on the PHQ-9 screening; a score of 4 on the clinical interview schedule-revised suicidality scale; strong preference for one intervention over the other. In the LIGHTMind study, the interventions were: n = 204 mindfulness-based cognitive therapy self-help (receipt of a copy of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy self-help workbook and 6 support sessions with a trained practitioner) n = 206 CBT self-help (receipt of a copy of CBT self-help workbook and 6 support sessions with a trained practitioner). In the LIGHTMind study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in PHQ score at 16 weeks post-randomization (7.2 points vs. 8.6 points; AD -1.5 points, 95% CI -2.6 to -0.4). In the LIGHTMind study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in generalized anxiety disorder 7-item scale score at 16 weeks (5.9 points vs. 7 points; AD -0.95 points, 95% CI -1.88 to -0.01) No significant difference in short warwick-edinburgh mental well-being scale at 16 weeks (15.7 points vs. 15.1 points; AD 0.97 points, 95% CI -0.05 to 1.99) No significant difference in work and social adjustment scale score at 16 weeks (11.8 points vs. 12.7 points; AD -1.39 points, 95% CI -3.05 to 0.28). In the LIGHTMind study, the conclusion was: in adult patients experiencing mild-to-moderate depression, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy self-help was superior to CBT self-help with respect to PHQ score at 16 weeks post-randomization.

Method

Design

This was a multicenter, pragmatic, assessor- and participant-blinded (participants were unaware of which intervention was hypothesized to be superior), parallel, superiority RCT with 1:1 allocation comparing practitioner-supported MBCT-SH with CBT-SH for adults experiencing mild to moderate depression in 10 Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services in England. The trial was preregistered, and the trial protocol was published. The trial protocol can be found in Supplement 1, and the statistical analysis plan can be found in Supplement 2. Ethical approval was given by the Health Research Authority London-Surrey Research Ethics Committee. Participants completed measures at baseline, 16 weeks postrandomization (postintervention), and 42 weeks postrandomization (follow-up). For further details of secondary hypotheses, see the eMethods in Supplement 3. This study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline.

Participants

Inclusion criteria were that participants (1) were 18 years or older; (2) met criteria on the Clinical Interview Schedule–Revised (CIS-R)for a primary diagnosis of a depressive episode, mixed anxiety and depression, or nonspecified mild neurotic disorder; (3) scored 10 or more points (clinical cutoff) on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depressionat initial IAPT assessment; and (4) self-reported sufficient literacy skills to use English-language self-help materials. Exclusion criteria were that participants: (1) scored 20 or more points (severe range) on the PHQ-9; (2) scored 4 on the CIS-R suicidality scale; and (3) expressed a strong preference for one intervention over the other such that, if randomized to the nonpreferred intervention, they would likely decline treatment. Race and ethnicity data were collected by using a questionnaire with the following options as recommended by the Office for National Statistics in the UK: Asian or Asian British (including Bangladeshi, Chinese, Indian, Pakistani, or any other); Black, African, Caribbean, or Black British (including African, Caribbean, or any other); mixed/multiple ethnic groups (including White and Asian, White and Black African, White and Black Caribbean, and any other); White (including English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish, British, Gypsy or Irish Traveler, Irish, or any other), other ethnic group (including Arab or any other), and prefer not to say.

### Clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of supported mindfulness-based cognitive therapy self-help compared with supported cognitive behavioral therapy self-help for adults experiencing depression: the low-intensity guided help through mindfulness (LIGHTMind) randomized clinical trial [^5250869b]. JAMA Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Practitioner-supported MBCT-SH is one solution to widen access. MBCT-SH overcomes the barrier of fixed group session times, enabling people with inflexible work or domestic commitments to engage at a convenient time and place. Evidence is emerging supporting the potential of MBCT-SH for depression. A randomized clinical trial (RCT) with students found that unsupported-MBCT-SH was superior compared with waitlist in reducing depression symptom severity, and another RCT found practitioner-supported MBCT-SH superior in reducing depression symptom severity compared with usual care for adults experiencing residual symptoms of depression. However, research to date does not answer the critical question of whether MBCT-SH for depression is clinically effective and cost-effective compared with the currently recommended practitioner-supported CBT-SH. If MBCT-SH is clinically effective and cost-effective in comparison, this would have significant implications for widening access to effective help.

We report findings from an RCT examining the clinical and cost-effectiveness of practitioner-supported MBCT-SH compared with practitioner-supported CBT-SH for adults experiencing mild to moderate depression. The prespecified primary hypothesiswas that practitioner-supported MBCT-SH, in comparison with practitioner-supported CBT-SH, would lead to greater reductions in depressive symptom severity from baseline to 16 weeks postrandomization. It was also hypothesized that MBCT-SH would be cost-effective in comparison with CBT-SH at follow-up and that MBCT-SH will be a safe alternative to CBT-SH, with a similarly low incidence of serious adverse events and lasting negative effects.

JAMA Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Procedure

Referrals were from the IAPT program. People experiencing depression were also invited through general practitioners and social media to self-refer to IAPT and, if eligible for self-help treatment in IAPT, were assessed for eligibility. Potential participants had a copy of the participant information sheet and the opportunity to ask questions before giving informed consent.

Participants completed measures online (with postal option). Participants completed baseline measures with a research assistant present in person or by phone. At the end of baseline, eligible participants were randomized. Participants were then sent their allocated self-help workbook and asked to guide themselves through with 6 Psychological Well-being Practitioner (PWP) 30-minute to 45-minute support sessions. Up to 16 weeks was given to complete each intervention to allow for breaks and holidays. The PWP support sessions were offered by phone or face-to-face, depending on service practice and, where services offered a choice, participant preference.

Participants had the option to complete assessments at 16 weeks and 42 weeks with a research assistant present in person or by phone or on their own. Where 16-week and 42-week assessments were not completed, weekly reminders were sent for up to 1 month.

Randomization and Masking

Participants were randomly assigned using Sealed Envelopestratified by IAPT service and initial PHQ-9 category (mild depression, 10–14 points; moderate depression, 15–19 points) using random permuted blocks of size 2, 4, or 6. The system was tested by the trial statistician (A.-M. B.-J.), who had no further involvement. Randomization was completed at the end of baseline, and participants were informed of their allocation by a research assistant. Assessors were typically not present at 16-week or 42-week online assessments, minimizing risk of bias. Where research assistants were present at 16 and 42 weeks, they were blind to allocation. If research assistants became unblinded, they were replaced by another blinded research assistant. Participants were not told the direction of hypotheses in relation to their randomized arm, only that the study was comparing 2 types of cognitive therapy. Analyses were carried out blind to study arm. Study PWPs were not blind to allocation.

JAMA Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

The primary hypothesis was supported: practitioner-supported MBCT-SH was superior to practitioner-supported CBT-SH in reducing depressive symptom severity at postintervention follow-up. In addition, PWP-supported MBCT-SH was found to be cost-effective compared with PWP-supported CBT-SH due to significantly lower total costs alongside similar QALY outcomes.

No serious adverse events attributable to the interventions were reported, and lasting negative effects were uncommon and similar in each arm, in line with previous psychological intervention research. This supports the hypothesis that practitioner-supported MBCT-SH is safe compared with practitioner-supported CBT-SH.

This study found that practitioner-supported MBCT-SH is not only more clinically effective than CBT-SH but also more cost-effective. On average, the CBT-SH intervention cost health services £526 ($631) more per participant than the MBCT-SH intervention over the 42-week follow-up. A substantial proportion of this additional cost (approximately 50%) was accounted for by additional face-to-face individual psychological therapy accessed by CBT-SH participants outside of the study intervention. If practitioner-supported MBCT-SH were offered as an alternative, it might be expected that some of the cost savings would fall on health services, potentially supporting increased treatment capacity.

### Clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of supported mindfulness-based cognitive therapy self-help compared with supported cognitive behavioral therapy self-help for adults experiencing depression: the low-intensity guided help through mindfulness (LIGHTMind) randomized clinical trial [^7fa91b48]. JAMA Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Depression has a lifetime prevalence of 10.8% worldwide. It is often recurrentand has significant personal and economic consequences. Despite this, there is a well-established treatment gap whereby most people with depression do not have access to evidence-based treatments. Effective and scalable interventions are therefore needed.

To widen access, cognitive behavioral therapy self-help (CBT-SH) supported by a trained practitioner is recommended in the treatment of mild to moderate depression in national treatment guidelines. CBT for depression explores and evaluates the interrelationships between thoughts, feelings, physical sensations, and behaviors in the maintenance of depression, along with the historical antecedents of unhelpful thinking patterns. The effectiveness of specialist CBT for depression offered by highly trained CBT therapists is well established; however, CBT-SH appears less acceptable, with higher rates of dropout. Alternatives to supported CBT-SH for depression are therefore needed.

Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an in-person group program recommended in national treatment guidelines for depression. Mindfulness involves deliberately bringing nonjudgmental awareness to present-moment experiences (eg, thoughts, feelings, physical sensations, behavioral urges), and this skill can be cultivated through mindfulness practice. In MBCT, daily mindfulness practice supported by verbal guidance and therapist-led discussion is combined with CBT for depression. Mindfulness practice is thought to facilitate greater awareness of the depressive maintenance cycle while also fostering a nonjudgmental attitude toward present-moment experiences and a recognition of thoughts as mental events, thereby potentially enhancing and broadening mechanisms targeted in CBT for depression. Meta-analyses of RCTs show MBCT is effective for depression, both in terms of reducing the relative risk of relapse for people with a history of recurrent depressionand in terms of reducing the severity of symptoms for people experiencing a current episode of depression. However, as with all specialist psychological therapies, MBCT is not widely available in publicly funded health services, and the fixed group session times and locations mean that, even when available, it is not universally accessible (eg, for shift workers or those with caring responsibilities).

### Clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of supported mindfulness-based cognitive therapy self-help compared with supported cognitive behavioral therapy self-help for adults experiencing depression: the low-intensity guided help through mindfulness (LIGHTMind) randomized clinical trial [^40454346]. JAMA Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Findings corroborate and extend findings from previous RCTs of MBCT-SH. While these previous trials found that MBCT-SH is effective in reducing the severity of depressive symptoms, they cannot answer the critical question of whether practitioner-supported MBCT-SH is a suitable alterative to the currently recommended practitioner-supported CBT-SH, either in terms of clinical effectiveness or cost-effectiveness. Moreover, while emerging evidence suggests that specialist MBCT and specialist CBT may be comparably effective for depression, our findings of superiority of MBCT-SH over CBH-SH suggest this may not be the case for practitioner-supported self-help versions of these therapies. Although dropout is higher for CBT-SH than CBT for depression, we did not find hypothesized between-group differences in intervention completion rates (PWP session attendance; eTable 8 in Supplement 3), and treatment completion did not mediate between-group differences on the primary outcome (eDiscussion in Supplement 3). Future research should therefore identify factors that contribute to the relative effectiveness of MBCT-SH over CBT-SH for depression. Exploring MBCT-SH engagement and predictors of engagement is an important avenue for future research. MBCT-SH, relative to CBT-SH, appears to have specific effects on acceptance (given effects on the nonjudge mindfulness subscale), and future quantitative and qualitative research should explore more fully the specific effects of MBCT-SH on depression-related outcomes.

In relation to secondary outcomes, we also found superior effects of supported MBCT-SH over CBT-SH on anxiety symptom severity at postintervention. At 42-week follow-up, between-group effects on depressive and anxiety symptom severity remained in the hypothesized direction but were nonsignificant. This could in part by explained by the greater postintervention psychological therapy accessed by CBT-SH participants. Lack of effects at postintervention and follow-up on all but the nonjudge mindfulness subscale was not expected. This potentially suggests that MBCT-SH relative to CBT-SH is effective at improving the specific mindfulness capacity to be accepting of unpleasant thoughts and emotions but not other aspects of the mindfulness construct. Existing measures of mindfulness may need reevaluating to improve their ability to discriminate the specific effects of MBCT.

JAMA Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Clinical Outcomes

The primary analysis of clinical outcomes was an intention-to-treat (ITT) between-group comparison of MBCT-SH to CBT-SH at 16 weeks and 42 weeks using a linear mixed model with treatment group, time (16 weeks or 42 weeks), and a treatment group × time interaction as fixed factors and site and baseline PHQ-9 score as covariates. Participants were included as random effects. The ITT sample was composed of all participants and observed data, and individuals were analyzed as per randomization allocation. Secondary outcomes were estimated using linear mixed models and contrasts. Secondary per-protocol analyses were conducted for intervention completers (attending 3 or more PWP sessions). As a sensitivity check, missing data were assumed to be missing at random and dealt with using multiple imputation by chained equations and compared with observed-cases findings. Multilevel logistic regression compared treatment completion between groups controlling for center and baseline PHQ-9 score and are presented as adjusted odds ratios. Mediation analyses tested whether treatment completion mediated depressive symptom severity outcomes. Unplanned subgroup analyses were conducted to estimate PHQ-9 treatment effects at 16 weeks by sex, race and ethnicity, and medication use. Statistical analysis was conducted using Stata version 16 (StataCorp).

Health Economic Analysis

The UK National Health Service or personal social services perspective preferred by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellencewas taken. The unit costs of the 2 interventions were estimated using a microcosting approach. Nationally applicable published unit costs were applied to all other services (eAppendix 1 in Supplement 3).

Cost-effectiveness was assessed through the calculation of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios explored in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) calculated from the EQ-5D-5L. Uncertainty was explored using cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves based on the net-benefit approach. Sensitivity analyses explored the impact of missing data and outliers/influential outliers (eAppendix 1 in Supplement 3).

JAMA Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

There were 3 serious adverse events (1.5%) in the MBCT-SH arm and 0 in the CBT-SH arm. All serious adverse events were deemed unrelated to the intervention by the independent clinical reviewer. Lasting negative effects of the intervention were reported in the CBT-SH and MBCT-SH groups by 6 of 147 participants (4.1%) and 8 of 146 participants (5.5%), respectively (eTable 9 in Supplement 3). In the CBT-SH arm, 2 of 6 attributed these effects to face-to-face meetings and feeling pressure to progress through the workbook, and 1 of 8 in MBCT-SH arm reported not liking the workbook and exercises. The remaining 11 did not give reasons.

Mean costs per group over the 42-week follow-up are reported in Table 3. Mean intervention costs were similar in the 2 arms, £174 ($209) in the MBCT-SH arm and £168 ($202) in the CBT-SH arm. Other health and social care costs were significantly lower in the MBCT-SH arm (mean [SD] cost per participant, £769 [£1102] [$923]) compared with the CBT-SH arm (mean [SD] cost per participant, £1403 [£2759] [$1684]; adjusted mean difference, −£530 [$636]; 95% CI, −£917 to −£144; P = 0.007). This was due to greater use in the CBT-SH arm of individual psychological therapies received outside of the trial, outpatient contacts for mental health, general practitioner contacts, and psychotropic medication. This resulted in significantly lower total costs in the MBCT-SH group (mean [SD] cost, £944 [£1102] [$1133]) compared with the CBT-SH group (mean [SD] cost, £1571 [£2754] [$1886]; adjusted mean difference, −£526 [$631]; 95% CI, −£908 to −£14; P = 0.007). There were no significant differences in QALYs (adjusted mean difference, 0.01; 95% CI, −0.01 to 0.03; P = 0.48).

Interventions

The Mindful Way Workbook: An 8-Week Program to Free Yourself from Depression and Emotional Distress, written by the pioneers of MBCT, presents the MBCT course as a self-help workbook. Overcoming Depression and Low Mood, 3rd Edition: A Five Areas Approach has evidence demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing depression symptom severityand is widely used in IAPT. Use of the self-help books was supported by 6 structured PWPs sessions.

Supervision and Monitoring

In IAPT, PWPs are graduates (in any discipline) who complete a year-long CBT-SH training. The 69 study PWPs received training to support MBCT-SH for this study. Training in the study involved qualified PWPs completing an MBCT course in person or using the workbook and then attending a 2-day MBCT-SH training. As is standard in MBCT, PWPs were encouraged to cultivate their own mindfulness practice.

The same PWPs delivered both interventions to account for therapist effects. To minimize therapeutic drift and therapy contamination, detailed PWP session-by-session protocols were provided, and PWPs were offered fortnightly telephone group supervision to cover both approaches with supervision led by clinical psychologists with doctoral training and trained in both CBT and MBCT with IAPT experience (C. S. and F. J.). Supervisors received monthly supervision of their supervision as additional quality assurance (R. C.).

Lived-Experience Involvement

People with lived experience of depression and of CBT and mindfulness were involved in study development. This included contributing to the project proposal, recruitment materials, and qualitative data collection and analysis. A Lived Experience Advisory Panel of 6 members was led by the lived experience coapplicant who also helped train PWPs. See eAppendix 2 in Supplement 3 for further details.

Statistical Analysis

The study was powered to detect a between-group standardized effect of 0.36 at 16 weeks on the primary outcome. This was based on the difference between the reported between-group effect of CBT-SH (0.42)and the between-group effect of MBCT-SH (0.78)on depressive symptom severity. The prespecified sample size of 410 provided 90% power to detect this effect with a 2-sided 5% alpha, allowing for 20% attrition. A data monitoring and ethics committee and a Trial Steering Committee provided trial oversight.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of psychological, psychosocial, pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for adults with a new episode of depression [^63a0d729]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Various effective treatments for depression exist. We aimed to identify the most effective first-line treatments for new episodes of less and more severe depression (defined by depression scale cut-off scores), to update NICE guidance on the management of Depression in Adults in England.

Methods

Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published up to June 2020 (PROSPERO registration number CRD42019151328). We analysed interventions by class and individually. The primary efficacy outcome was depressive symptom change (expressed as standardised mean difference [SMD]). The review for this outcome was updated in November 2023.

Findings

We included 676 RCTs, 105,477 participants and 63 treatment classes. For less severe depression, group cognitive/cognitive behavioural therapy (CT/CBT) class was efficacious versus treatment as usual [TAU], the reference treatment for this population [SMD −1.01 (95% Credible Interval [CrI] −1.76; −0.06)]. For more severe depression, efficacious classes versus pill placebo (reference treatment for this population) included combined individual CT/CBT with antidepressants [−1.18 (−2.07; −0.44)], individual behavioural therapies [−0.86 (−1.65; −0.16)], combined light therapy with antidepressants [−0.86 (−1.59; −0.12)], combined acupuncture with antidepressants [−0.78 (−1.12; −0.44)], individual CT/CBT [−0.78 (−1.42; −0.33)], mirtazapine [−0.35 (−0.48; −0.22)], serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [−0.32 (−0.43; −0.22)], tricyclic antidepressants [−0.29 (−0.50; −0.05)], and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [−0.24 (−0.32; −0.16)]. Additional treatments showed evidence of efficacy at the intervention level. Evidence for less and more severe depression was of low and low-to-moderate quality, respectively. In the 2023 update, group yoga and self-help without support emerged as efficacious for less severe depression. For more severe depression, combined group exercise with antidepressants emerged as efficacious, whereas combined light therapy with antidepressants failed to remain efficacious.

Interpretation

Group CT/CBT (and possibly group yoga and self-help) appears efficacious in less severe depression, whereas antidepressants do not show evidence of effect. Combined antidepressants with individual CT/CBT, acupuncture and, possibly, group exercise, individual psychological therapies (behavioural therapies, CT/CBT) alone, and antidepressants alone appear efficacious in more severe depression. Quality of evidence, cost-effectiveness, applicability and implementation issues also need to be considered when formulating clinical practice recommendations.

Harms of screening and psychological treatment — adults and perinatal populations: One postpartum depression screening RCT (n = 462) reported no adverse events in either the intervention or placebo groups, and across screening studies there was no pattern suggesting paradoxical worsening of outcomes. Across ≈63 RCTs (n = 8466) in systematic reviews of psychotherapy, psychological interventions — including self-guided and guided internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy — did not increase the risk of harm measured as worsening depressive symptoms; however, in a systematic review of older adults, 14 trials did not report safety data.

Discussion

This large NMA, which was undertaken specifically to inform recommendations on first-line treatments of a new depressive episode as part of national guidance on the treatment and management of depression on adults, compared psychological, psychosocial, pharmacological, physical and combined first-line treatments for a new depressive episode stratified by symptom severity level and synthesised evidence from 676 RCTs, 105,477 participants and 63 classes in 5 efficacy and two discontinuation outcomes.

For less severe depression, predominantly the group CT/CBT class, other group interventions (e.g. behavioural activation, MBCT), individual third-wave cognitive therapy, and, marginally, individual CBT (≥ 15 sessions), cognitive bibliotherapy with or without support, and a number of computerised interventions with or without support, appeared to be effective versus TAU. Most other classes and interventions showed improvements in outcomes compared with TAU, but results were uncertain. Antidepressants did not show evidence of effect compared with either TAU or pill placebo. Results may be explained by benefits associated with group cohesion and normalization effects, learning and support from others and functioning as co-therapists, The lack of a clear, distinguishable effect for most other treatments versus TAU may be attributable to the increased likelihood for non-specific effects, such as natural recovery, in less severe depression. Group CT/CBT, the only class with clear evidence of effect versus TAU, was tested on N = 480 on the SMD.

For more severe depression, combined treatments (antidepressants combined with individual CT/CBT, light therapy, or acupuncture) were more effective than antidepressants, psychological treatments, acupuncture, or exercise alone. Individual psychological treatment classes (behavioural therapies, CT/CBT), other psychological interventions (problem solving, non-directive counselling, short-term PDPT, cognitive bibliotherapy, computerised CBT with or without support) and antidepressants (mirtazapine, SNRIs, TCAs and SSRIs) were effective versus pill placebo. Some self-help and high-intensity psychological interventions showed higher effects than antidepressants. Most other classes and interventions showed improvements in outcomes but with considerable uncertainty. Antidepressants showed higher risk of discontinuation due to side effects relative to pill placebo. Antidepressants had by far the largest evidence base (ranging from N = 1884 for mirtazapine to N = 22,018 for SSRIs on the SMD outcome), followed by individual CT/CBT class (N = 1044), combined acupuncture with antidepressants (N = 584), and individual behavioural therapies class (N = 378).

Subthreshold/minor depression — insufficient evidence comparisons — The panel had insufficient evidence to recommend behavioral bibliotherapy (self-guided) vs. treatment as usual for subthreshold depression and life review therapy (individual) vs. treatment as usual for subthreshold depression; this is labeled Insufficient evidence for a recommendation, and because there is insufficient evidence available to determine differences in treatment effect for the listed treatment comparisons for older adult patients with subthreshold or minor depression, the panel makes no recommendations of one treatment over the other and states that decision should be based on shared decision-making with the patient.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of psychological, psychosocial, pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for adults with a new episode of depression [^2c60f616]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

No class showed higher risk of discontinuation versus reference in either depressive symptom level. Other than SSRIs in less severe depression, all assessed antidepressant classes showed higher risk of discontinuation due to side effects compared with pill placebo.

The sensitivity analysis conducted to explore the transitivity assumption between pharmacological and non-pharmacological trial participants suggested only small changes in non-pharmacological treatment effects on the SMD after exclusion of pharmacological RCTs for less severe depression, probably because there were few pharmacological trials in this population. For more severe depression, exclusion of pharmacological trials resulted in some changes and higher uncertainty in effects and rankings of non-pharmacological treatments, apparently because most evidence in this population came from pharmacological trials (Appendix 6). Overall, non-pharmacological treatment effects were not substantially affected after exclusion of pharmacological trials.

Results from the 2023 review update

The search update identified 26,024 records. Following machine learning methods that eliminated records with high likelihood of being irrelevant, 5656 publications remained as potentially eligible, of which 165 were assessed at full text for eligibility. The selection process resulted in 16 and 10 new RCTs for less and more severe depression, respectively (see flow diagram in Appendix 9). Conclusions on the SMD (primary outcome) remained largely unchanged. However, in contrast to the original analysis for less severe depression, group yoga and self-help without support showed evidence of effect versus TAU. Group yoga also showed evidence of effect versus self-help with support in this population. At the intervention level, in addition to group interventions, individual behavioural activation, individual CBT interventions and a wider range of self-help interventions without support showed evidence of effect versus TAU. The updated analysis for more severe depression differed from the original results in that combined group exercise with antidepressants showed evidence of efficacy versus pill placebo, whereas combined light therapy with antidepressants failed to show evidence of efficacy versus pill placebo (however, interventions within this class retained evidence of efficacy versus pill placebo). At the intervention level, combined group CBT with antidepressants appeared to be more efficacious than group CBT alone, antidepressants alone, individual exercise interventions and acupuncture. Appendix 9 and Appendix 10 show full data and results on the depressive symptom change (SMD) outcome following the review update.

### Interventions to prevent perinatal depression: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^aa911344]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF levels of certainty regarding net benefit — High certainty reflects consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative primary care populations with conclusions unlikely to be strongly affected by future studies. Moderate certainty indicates evidence is sufficient to determine effects but confidence is constrained by factors such as study number, size, quality, inconsistency, limited generalizability, or lack of coherence in the chain of evidence, and as more information becomes available the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change. Low certainty indicates evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes due to limitations such as few or small studies, important flaws, inconsistency, gaps in the chain of evidence, lack of generalizability, or lack of information on important health outcomes.

### Trial of web-based guided self-help for prevention of major depression… [^661dcb18]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

The number needed to treat to avoid 1 new case of MDD was 5.
9. Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with subthreshold depression, the use of a web-based guided self-help intervention compared with enhanced usual care reduced the incidence of MDD over 12 months. Further research is needed to understand whether the effects are generalizable to both first onset of depression and depression recurrence as well as efficacy without the use of an online trainer. Because no estimate of clinical relevance exists for the incidence of MDD, we assumed an absolute risk reduction of at least 10% for the incidence of MDD between the intervention and control groups as clinically relevant.

This threshold was derived by consulting clinical experts in the field of depression prevention and asking stakeholders who would potentially use a web-based intervention in routine care about a threshold above which they would consider the results worthwhile from a clinical perspective. To assess the robustness of the preventive effect of the intervention, a subgroup analysis excluded those participants taking antidepressants at baseline. A per-protocol analysis tested whether intervention completers differed from noncompleters with regard to any baseline characteristics and with regard to time to onset of a major depressive disorder.

Significant differences in change from baseline to 12-month follow-up in favor of the intervention group were found for all outcomes except for the physical health summary score of the SF-12, the positive problem-orientation subscale of the SPSI-R, and worrying. Corresponding effect sizes were small to moderate. We did not find any significant differences in health care use between study conditions. Fourth, we identified a 10% risk reduction as clinically relevant. However, this assumption was based on expert opinion. Fifth, we did not assess chronic medical conditions. Experiencing chronic medical conditions might be a risk indicator for the onset of MDD. Future studies should thus assess such conditions or evaluate the effects of web-based guided self-help interventions directly in such patient groups. Sixth, it was not possible to mask participants to their assigned study condition.

This is a common problem in trials evaluating psychological interventions. Nevertheless, it might have distorted results of the trial.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of psychological, psychosocial, pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for adults with a new episode of depression [^23b75cf4]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Various effective treatments for depression exist. We aimed to identify the most effective first-line treatments for new episodes of less and more severe depression (defined by depression scale cut-off scores), to update NICE guidance on the management of Depression in Adults in England.

Methods

Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published up to June 2020 (PROSPERO registration number CRD42019151328). We analysed interventions by class and individually. The primary efficacy outcome was depressive symptom change (expressed as standardised mean difference [SMD]). The review for this outcome was updated in November 2023.

Findings

We included 676 RCTs, 105,477 participants and 63 treatment classes. For less severe depression, group cognitive/cognitive behavioural therapy (CT/CBT) class was efficacious versus treatment as usual [TAU], the reference treatment for this population [SMD -1.01 (95% Credible Interval [CrI] -1.76; -0.06)]. For more severe depression, efficacious classes versus pill placebo (reference treatment for this population) included combined individual CT/CBT with antidepressants [-1.18 (-2.07; -0.44)], individual behavioural therapies [-0.86 (-1.65; -0.16)], combined light therapy with antidepressants [-0.86 (-1.59; -0.12)], combined acupuncture with antidepressants [-0.78 (-1.12; -0.44)], individual CT/CBT [-0.78 (-1.42; -0.33)], mirtazapine [-0.35 (-0.48; -0.22)], serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [-0.32 (-0.43; -0.22)], tricyclic antidepressants [-0.29 (-0.50; -0.05)], and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [-0.24 (-0.32; -0.16)]. Additional treatments showed evidence of efficacy at the intervention level. Evidence for less and more severe depression was of low and low-to-moderate quality, respectively. In the 2023 update, group yoga and self-help without support emerged as efficacious for less severe depression. For more severe depression, combined group exercise with antidepressants emerged as efficacious, whereas combined light therapy with antidepressants failed to remain efficacious.

Interpretation

Group CT/CBT (and possibly group yoga and self-help) appears efficacious in less severe depression, whereas antidepressants do not show evidence of effect. Combined antidepressants with individual CT/CBT, acupuncture and, possibly, group exercise, individual psychological therapies (behavioural therapies, CT/CBT) alone, and antidepressants alone appear efficacious in more severe depression. Quality of evidence, cost-effectiveness, applicability and implementation issues also need to be considered when formulating clinical practice recommendations.

### Is guided self-help as effective as face-to-face psychotherapy for depression and anxiety disorders? A systematic review and meta-analysis of comparative outcome studies [^a68c0f6a]. Psychological Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Although guided self-help for depression and anxiety disorders has been examined in many studies, it is not clear whether it is equally effective as face-to-face treatments. MethodWe conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in which the effects of guided self-help on depression and anxiety were compared directly with face-to-face psychotherapies for depression and anxiety disorders. A systematic search in bibliographical databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Cochrane) resulted in 21 studies with 810 participants.

Results

The overall effect size indicating the difference between guided self-help and face-to-face psychotherapy at post-test was d = -0.02, in favour of guided self-help. At follow-up (up to 1 year) no significant difference was found either. No significant difference was found between the drop-out rates in the two treatments formats.

Conclusions

It seems safe to conclude that guided self-help and face-to-face treatments can have comparable effects. It is time to start thinking about implementation in routine care.

### Cognitive, behavioural or cognitive-behavioural self-help interventions for subclinical depression in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^2b384e98]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Subclinical depression is a risk factor for the development of major depression in older adults. We aimed to determine the effectiveness of pure self-help or self-help with minimal support to reduce depressive symptoms and to prevent the onset of major depression in this population.

Methods

This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of trials that used self-administrated cognitive, behavioural or cognitive-behavioural interventions for older adults with subclinical depression compared to control groups. Medline, Embase, PsycInfo and Cochrane databases were searched for relevant studies.

Results

We analysed eight trials involving 1449 participants. A small but significant effect favouring the intervention was found at short-term [d = 0.33; 95% CI (Confidence Interval): 0.20–0.47] and at long-term (d = 0.22; 95% CI: 0.04–0.40) for depressive symptoms. None of the studies looked at the preventive effect of self-help interventions in reducing the probability of a subsequent diagnosis of major depression.

Limitations

The low number of studies meant that it was not possible to test for publication bias. The absence of pre-published protocols for many of the studies meant that there is a possibility of selective reporting bias for some of the primary studies.

Conclusions

There is some evidence that cognitive-behavioural self-help interventions may reduce depressive symptoms in older adults with subclinical depression. However, no study examined whether the intervention had a preventative effect in reducing the likelihood of a subsequent diagnosis of major depression.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^84f9a041]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Guideline for the Treatment of Depression — evidence grading and benefits/harms assessment states that aggregate/global strength of evidence is based on two critical outcomes (response to treatment and serious adverse events) and "could be no higher than the lowest individual strength of evidence for each of the critical outcomes", leading to overall ratings that were insufficient/very low across interventions when evidence for serious harms was insufficient/very low. Quantification of benefits drew on quantitative meta-analyses for outcomes selected by the panel for interventions with at least low-quality evidence for response to treatment. Magnitude of benefits and harms/burdens was rated on "a five-point scale: (1) large/modest* benefit; (2) small benefit; (3) no effect; (4) small harm; and (5) modest*/large harm", with a later preference for the term "moderate" instead of "modest", and an approximate rule of thumb for effect sizes that "a small effect size is 0.20, medium is 0.50 and large is 0.90". Harms were differentiated from burdens as disruptions associated with treatment (e.g., time spent, homework/need to practice, cost, convenience). To address limited reporting, the panel asked APA staff to extract harms/burdens data from included studies (e.g., dropout/attrition, symptom worsening, homework), and adult and child/adolescent harms/burdens were derived only from included review articles. The panel did not consider attrition a harm unless reasons were specified or there were differential attrition rates across treatment groups.

### Psychological treatment of depression in primary care: recent developments [^15177f69]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Unguided internet-based self-help is also increasingly examined in randomized trials. These are also CBT-based interventions in which the protocol is delivered over the internet, but in which no professional support is given and the patient has to go through the intervention independently. In one large "individual patient data" meta-analysis, with the primary data of 3876 patients from 13 trials on unguided internet-based self-help, it was found that the effects of these unguided interventions are smaller than those of guided self-help, but still significant compared with care-as-usual and waiting list control groups. In the network meta-analysis comparing different treatment formats of CBT, self-help without any professional support was more effective than waitlist controls, but not more effective than care-as-usual. Self-help without professional support may therefore be useful as alternative for watchful waiting in mild depression, and may be effective in some patients, but the effects are not as large as those of internet-based guided self-help or face-to-face therapies.

Although most of this research has been done across different settings, there are also a growing number of randomized trials in primary care. One recent meta-analysis of 8 randomized trials on computerized CBT in primary care confirmed the general findings described above that guided self-help is effective with small to moderate effects (g = 0.37), while unguided has little effect compared with control conditions (g = 0.04). This suggests that the findings across different treatment settings are also valid in primary care settings. General practitioners may, however, be less inclined to recommend low intensity interventions for their patients.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^c06e55ed]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

APA Guideline for the Treatment of Depression — recommendation framework and key definitions across children and adolescents, the general adult population, and older adults are described as follows: No treatment is defined as "No active treatment was provided (i.e., waitlist)". Efficacy is "The impact of an intervention compared to an inactive control", and comparative effectiveness "compares at least two different active treatments to each other to assess for the benefits of one (or combination) versus the other (or combination)". Recommendations pertaining to efficacy "do not imply that these treatments are superior to other active treatments". Decision-making criteria were that the panel "recommended treatments that were consistently superior to nonactive control conditions or for which there was evidence of equivalency or superiority to other treatments", "conditionally recommended treatments that were consistently superior to nonactive control conditions" when either "Other active treatments… were superior", there was "Insufficient evidence that the treatment was equivalent to other effective treatments", or there were "Greater harms/burdens than with other treatments", and the panel "did not recommend treatments or recommended against treatments if there was insufficient evidence of efficacy or if the harms were considered to outweigh any benefits". The ultimate decision "should be based on shared decision-making with the patient" and, for youth, "the parents/guardians or family members actively involved in their care".

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^b769c403]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Depression guideline — generalizing aggregate research to individual patients: The document advises readers to consider limits of generalization because evidence is based on group data and can only provide general types of information, so greater mismatch between study populations and a given patient requires more informed clinical judgment to select treatment. As an illustration of demographic limits in samples, it notes that if evidence comes primarily from White males "between the ages of 25 to 50 years", extrapolating automatic effectiveness to others is less scientifically rigorous.

### The effects of delivery format on the effectiveness and acceptability of self-guided interventions for depression in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^29465ea4]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Self-guided interventions could improve the availability of evidence-based psychotherapies for late-life depressive symptoms. However, their treatment outcomes and acceptability across delivery formats remain uncertain. This review aimed to examine the effectiveness and acceptability of self-guided intervention for older adults with depressive symptoms and the impact of different intervention features. Randomised controlled trials included older adults (mean age ≥ 60 years) with elevated depressive symptoms who received self-guided interventions for depression were eligible. Trials were extracted from an existing database and updated systematic literature searches in PubMed, PsychINFO, Embase, and Cochrane Library (last update: 20th Mar 2025). Data were synthesised with random-effects meta-analysis, subgroup analysis, and meta-regressions. Outcomes included depressive symptoms, quality of life, and dropout rates. Seven studies with 1170 participants were identified. Compared to controls, self-guided interventions had small-to-moderate effect in reducing depressive symptoms at post-treatment (g = 0.46, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.73), but the effect was not sustained at 3-to-12-month follow-up (g = 0.15, 95% CI -0.45 to 0.74). Effects on quality of life remains inconclusive. Acceptability was comparable between self-guided interventions and control conditions (RR = 1.52, p = .294). No differences in treatment effects and acceptability were observed across delivery formats, support levels, or initial human screening. Most studies showed a moderate-to-high risk of bias (n = 6). Self-guided interventions for depression were associated with reductions in depressive symptoms and were acceptable to older adults, regardless of delivery format and level of human support. They may be considered a brief intervention option in resource-limited setting.

APA guideline — recommendation development and documentation — reports that "The panel considered four factors" when drafting recommendations: "(1) overall strength of the evidence, (2) balance of benefits versus harms/burdens, (3) patient values and preferences, and (4) applicability", and based on these it "made a recommendation or conditional recommendation for or against each particular treatment or made a statement that there was insufficient evidence". Decision processes used "a tool called a decision table (created by APA staff)" for older adults and were later streamlined to a "grid" in supplemental materials.

American College of Physicians (ACP) GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach — grading certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations is defined as: High evidence "Confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect (the intervention "results in" the effect)", Moderate evidence "Moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a sizeable possibility that it is substantially different (the intervention "probably results in" the effect)", and Low evidence "Confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect (the intervention "may result in" the effect)". Strength categories include Strong (ACP recommends) with "Confidence that the benefits clearly outweigh risks and burden or vice versa", applying to "most patients in most circumstances" with the policy note that "Only strong recommendations could be considered as quality indicators to guide the development of accountability, reporting, and payment programs", and Conditional (ACP suggests) where "Benefits probably outweigh the risks and burden, or vice versa, but there is appreciable uncertainty", which "Applies to many patients but may differ depending on circumstances or patients' values and preferences", with policy implications that "Policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of many stakeholders. Policies are also more likely to vary between regions. Quality indicators would have to focus on the fact that adequate deliberation about the management options has taken place".

### Efficacy of low intensity interventions for geriatric depression and anxiety – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^0da0723c]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the efficacy of low intensity psychological interventions for older adults (60+ years) with clinical anxiety and/or depressive disorders.

Method

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised control trials of low-intensity psychological interventions for anxiety and/or depression with an active or passive control condition (e.g., waitlist, treatment-as-usual or active control) in any setting. Low intensity psychological interventions (e.g., cognitive behaviour therapy [CBT]) targeted anxiety and/or depression as primary outcomes, were primarily self-help, and included support from trained practitioners/facilitators with < 6 h total contact time (typically < 30 min p/contact).

Results

Seven studies consisting of 304 older adults (65–78 years, M age = 70, SD = 4) were identified and six included in the meta-analysis of depression outcomes and three for anxiety. A random effects meta-analysis of group differences in symptom change from pre-post treatment found evidence favouring low intensity psychological interventions over passive control groups for the treatment of depressive and anxiety symptoms, with moderate effect sizes for depression (Cohen's d = -0.62) and large effect sizes for anxiety (Cohen's d = -0.84) at post-treatment.

Limitations

Results are limited by study design of included studies such that the efficacy of interventions compared to treatment-as-usual, non-CBT approaches, in adults > 80 years and long-term effects are unknown.

Conclusions

There is some evidence supporting the clinical benefits of low intensity psychological interventions for depressive and anxiety symptoms in older adults compared to passive controls. More research is needed to examine efficacy compared to active control conditions, and among those over 80 years.

Delivery of treatments — Although all the recommendations focus on types of interventions, the way in which treatments are delivered is also important, yet the current review provided limited information in this area; collaborative care approaches have been well established as an evidence-based and well-established system, but the current review did not address this; the panel found insufficient evidence about the effectiveness of psychotherapies in specific target groups, and very limited data on whether treatment format influenced efficacy, with the limited CBT format evidence not finding differences.

### What makes self-help interventions effective in the management of depressive symptoms? Meta-analysis and meta-regression [^472a3c91]. Psychological Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Although self-help interventions are effective in treating depression, less is known about the factors that determine effectiveness (i.e. moderators of effect). This study sought to determine whether the content of self-help interventions, the study populations or aspects of study design were the most important moderators.

Method

Randomized trials of the effectiveness of self-help interventions versus controls in the treatment of depressive symptoms were identified using previous reviews and electronic database searches. Data on moderators (i.e. patient populations, study design, intervention content) and outcomes were extracted and analysed using meta-regression.

Results

Thirty-four studies were identified with 39 comparisons. Study design factors associated with greater effectiveness were unclear allocation concealment, observer-rated outcome measures and waiting-list control groups. Greater effectiveness was also associated with recruitment in non-clinical settings, patients with existing depression (rather than those 'at risk'), contact with a therapist (i.e.g.uided self-help) and the use of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) techniques. However, only guided self-help remained significant in the multivariate analysis [regression coefficient 0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05–0.68, p = 0.03]. In the subset of guided studies, there were no significant associations between outcomes and the session length, content, delivery mode or therapist background.

Conclusions

The results provide some insights into moderators of self-help interventions, which might assist in the design of future interventions. However, the present study did not provide a comprehensive description, and other research methods might be required to identify factors associated with the effectiveness of self-help.

Since the advent of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy in the 1960s and 1970s, the progress on "talking therapies" has been slow. An extensive review of prevention and treatment studies over the past 50 years has shown that, although the therapies are effective, for depression the effect size is moderate, even for treatment, and has not changed in 50 years, 1 with some indication that efficacy may have decreased. 2 The approaches used in treatment have also been the mainstay of depression prevention approaches, 3, 4 with evidence of a small-to-moderate reduction in depressive symptoms but with no convincing evidence of reduction in the incidence of depressive disorder in meta-analyses. 3, 4.

### The clinical effectiveness of CBT-based guided self-help interventions for anxiety and depressive disorders: a systematic review [^27309692]. Psychological Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)-based guided self-help (GSH) has been suggested to be an effective intervention for mild to moderate anxiety and depression, yet the evidence seems inconclusive, with some studies reporting that GSH is effective and others finding that GSH is ineffective. GSH differs in important respects from other levels of self-help, yet the literature regarding exclusively guided self-help interventions for anxiety and depression has not been reviewed systematically.

Method

A literature search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining CBT-based GSH interventions for anxiety and depressive disorders was conducted. Multiple electronic databases were searched; several journals spanning key disciplines were hand-searched; reference lists of included review articles were scanned and relevant first authors were contacted.

Results

Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis indicated the effectiveness of GSH at post-treatment, although GSH was found to have limited effectiveness at follow-up or among more clinically representative samples. Studies that reported greater effectiveness of GSH tended to be of lower methodological quality and generally involved participants who were self-selected rather than recruited through clinical referrals.

Conclusions

Although there is support for the effectiveness of CBT-based GSH among media-recruited individuals, the finding that the reviewed RCTs had limited effectiveness within routine clinical practice demonstrates that the evidence is not conclusive. Further rigorous evidence based on clinical populations that examines longer-term outcomes is required before CBT-based GSH interventions can be deemed effective for adults accessing primary care services for treatment of anxiety and depression.

### Self-help mobile messaging intervention for depression among older adults in resource-limited settings: a randomized controlled trial [^c2fd3570]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Main

Reducing the burden of depression in older adults is a global health priority, key to ensuring healthy aging and promoting well-being, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where 69% of the world's older population live. In Brazil, the number of adults aged 65 years or older has increased by 57% since 2010, now representing 11% of the total population. Of the older adults interviewed in the Brazilian National Health Survey of 2019, 12% reported that they had experienced depression in the past. Estimates from low-resource settings in Brazil found that 30% of the older population had experienced depressive symptoms suggestive of clinical depression; only one-third of them had received a previous diagnosis.

Programs led by trained nonmental health specialists (task-sharing) and with a team-based approach (collaborative care) have been effective in treating depression in all ages, including old age –. However, these programs often require a prominent role for health professionals, which is not feasible in health systems with few professionals who are already overstretched with other priorities. For example, during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, non-coronavirus disease health services were reduced to a minimum in Brazilbecause of restrictions on in-person consultations and the health system's unpreparedness to provide remote care.

A useful strategy to improve access to treatment for depression without increasing health professionals' workloads is the use of self-help digital mental health interventions, which are low-cost alternatives requiring minimal or no health professional support. However, there is little evidence on the effectiveness of such interventions for older adults with depressive symptoms, especially in LMICs.

Therefore, we developed a self-help mobile messaging intervention for older adults with substantial depressive symptoms. Viva Vida is a 6-week digital psychosocial intervention delivered by WhatsApp audio and visual messages, without health professional support. It was adapted from a task-shared, collaborative care psychosocial program led by community health workers in Brazil, PROACTIVE, which improved recovery from depression at the 8-month and 12-month follow-ups. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of Viva Vida in a pragmatic, single-blind, two-arm, individually randomized controlled trial among older adults registered in primary care in socioeconomically deprived areas of Guarulhos, Brazil (PRODIGITAL-D).

### Screening for depression in adults… [^e86d2105]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Quiz Ref IDThe USPSTF found convincing evidence that treatment of adults and older adults with depression identified through screening in primary care settings with antidepressants, psychotherapy, or both decreases clinical morbidity. The USPSTF also found adequate evidence that treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy improves clinical outcomes in pregnant and postpartum women with depression. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the magnitude of harms of screening for depression in adults is small to none. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the magnitude of harms of treatment with CBT in postpartum and pregnant women is small to none. Multidisciplinary team–based primary care that includes self-management support and care coordination has been shown to be effective in management of depression. These components of primary care are detailed in recommendations from the Community Preventive Services Task Force.

4 It recommends collaborative care for the treatment of major depression in adults 18 years and older on the basis of strong evidence of effectiveness in improving short-term treatment outcomes. The 2009 USPSTF recommendation concluded that the evidence was sufficient to establish the benefits of treatment of depression in general adult populations, including older adults. 10 A systematic review of intention-to-treat trials comparing 3 groups of adult patients who received antidepressants, psychotherapy, or a control condition reported a 46% remission rate with antidepressants and a 48% remission rate with psychotherapy after 10 to 16 weeks. 11 Two systematic reviews concluded that antidepressants were effective in treating depression in older adults.

The most applicable trial found that 45% of intervention participants reported a 5-point or greater reduction in 9-item PHQ score compared with 35% of usual care participants.
17. Pooled results that used only the longest follow-up period within 1 year showed a 35% increase in the likelihood of remission with CBT compared with usual care. The other 8 non-CBT studies examined a diverse range of interventions but did not provide sufficient evidence to draw conclusions for any one approach. There was also insufficient evidence to assess differences in effectiveness for patient subgroups.

### Discovering common elements of empirically supported self-help interventions for depression in primary care: a systematic review [^2ce07798]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although the efficacy of self-help cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression has been well established, its feasibility in primary care settings is limited because of time and resource constraints. The goal of this study was to identify common elements of empirically supported (i.e., proven effective in controlled research) self-help CBTs and frameworks for effective use in practice.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for self-help CBTs for depression in primary care were systematically identified in Pubmed, PsycINFO, and CENTRAL. The distillation and matching model approach was used to abstract commonly used self-help techniques (practice elements). Study contexts associated with unique combinations of intervention elements were explored, including total human support dose (total face-to-face, telephone, and personalized email contact time recommended by the protocol), effective symptom domain (depression vs. general psychological distress), and severity of depression targeted by the study. Relative contribution to intervention success was estimated for individual elements and human support by conditional probability (CP, proportion of the number of times each element appeared in a successful intervention to the number of times it was used in the interventions identified by the review).

Results

Twenty-one interventions (12 successful) in 20 RCTs and 21 practice elements were identified. Cognitive restructuring, behavioral activation, and homework assignment were elements appearing in > 80% of successful interventions. The dose of human support was positively associated with the proportion of interventions that were successful in a significant linear fashion (CPs: interventions with no support, 0.20; 1–119 min of support, 0.60; 120 min of support, 0.83; p = 0.042). In addition, human support increased the probability of success for most of the extracted elements. Only social support activation, homework assignment, and interpersonal skills were highly successful (CPs ≥ 0.60) when minimal support was provided.

Discussion

These findings suggest that human support is an important component in creating an evidence-informed brief self-help program compatible with primary care settings.

### Behavioural activation for depression: efficacy, effectiveness and dissemination [^3c05511e]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Depression being a prevalent psychobiological disorder across the world, there is a need to identify effective, evidence-based treatments that are time and cost-effective in an effort to increase the population's accessibility to treatments. Low-intensity interventions, such as guided self-help treatments, hold promise for the dissemination of evidence-based treatments. Behavioural activation, a component of cognitive-behavioural therapy, is receiving increasing attention and empirical support as a stand-alone psychological treatment for depression. This article reviews behavioural activation's theoretical foundations and efficacy in light of determining its potential as a low-intensity intervention.

Method

A systematic review of articles on low-intensity behavioural activation interventions for depression was conducted using the PsychInfo, Medline and Embase databases. Behavioural activation's potential for dissemination as a guided self-help treatment is discussed and future avenues of research are stressed.

Limitations

Studies on the efficacy of behavioural activation as a guided self-help treatment are very limited to date and there are significant variations among existing studies.

Conclusions

Based on the research literature, it can be concluded that behavioural activation could be a viable option as a low-intensity guided self-help psychological treatment for mild to moderate depression. Further research is required to better understand the optimal parameters and client-therapist characteristics of this form of low-intensity intervention.

USPSTF — benefits of early detection and treatment: The USPSTF found no studies that directly assessed the benefits of screening for eating disorders. Twenty-four trials (n = 1644) assessed psychological interventions. Among adults with binge eating disorder, guided self-help improved symptom severity vs inactive control with pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) −0.96 (95% CI, −1.26 to −0.67) (5 trials; n = 391). Unguided self-help (6 trials; n = 368) also favored intervention, but the difference between groups was not statistically significant (SMD, −0.18 [95% CI, −0.38 to 0.03]). Self-help interventions reduced depression.

### Supported self-help to prevent relapse or recurrence of depression: who benefits most? [^3c13a94f]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

This study aimed to identify subgroups for whom supported self-help preventive cognitive therapy (S-PCT) is more (cost)effective than treatment as usual (TAU) in preventing relapse and recurrence of major depression.

Methods

We conducted a randomized controlled trial in which 248 remitted, recurrently depressed participants were randomized to S-PCT (n = 124) or TAU (n = 124). Clinical outcome was relapse or recurrence of major depressive disorder (SCID-I). We tested the moderating effects on relapse or recurrence of age, gender, education level, residual depressive symptoms, number of previous episodes, age of onset, antidepressant medication, somatization, and self-efficacy with logistic regression analyses adjusted for baseline values of depressive symptoms. We examined moderating effects on costs using linear regression analyses adjusted for baseline costs. A stratified cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to tease out differences in cost-effectiveness between subgroups.

Results

We found no moderating effect on relapse or recurrence for any of the potential moderators. For costs, the number of previous depressive episodes was identified as a moderator. At a willingness-to-pay of 16,000€, the probability that S-PCT was cost-effective compared to TAU was 95% for participants with 2–3 episodes and 11% for participants with ≥ 4 episodes.

Limitations

Participants and counselors were not blinded. The study was primarily designed to assess the (cost)effectiveness of S-PCT and not to conduct moderation analyses.

Conclusions

S-PCT was effective in preventing relapse or recurrence of depressive disorders in a broad range of participants, but is more likely to be cost-effective in participants with 2–3 episodes than ≥ 4 episodes. This indicates that S-PCT can best be offered to participants with fewer previous depressive episodes.

### SPIRIT 2025 explanation and elaboration: updated guideline for protocols of randomised trials [^1856a959]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Explanation

Blinding (masking) — the process of keeping the study group assignment hidden after allocation — is commonly used to reduce the risk of bias in randomised trials. Awareness of the intervention assigned to participants can introduce ascertainment bias in the measurement of outcomes, particularly subjective ones (eg, quality of life); performance bias in the decision to discontinue or modify study interventions (eg, dosing changes) (item 15b), concomitant interventions, or other aspects of care (item 15d); and exclusion or attrition bias in the decision to withdraw from the trial or to exclude a participant from the analysis. We use the generally preferred term blinding but acknowledge that others prefer to use the term masking because of the association between blind and an ophthalmological condition or health outcome.

Many groups can be blinded: trial participants, care providers, data collectors, outcome assessors, data analysts, and manuscript writers. Blinding of data monitoring committee members is generally discouraged.

When blinding of trial participants and care providers is not possible owing to obvious differences between the interventions, blinding of the outcome assessors can often still be implemented. The exception is in trials with patient or participant reported outcomes (eg, pain) where the patient is the outcome assessor.

It may also be possible to blind participants or trial staff to the study hypothesis in terms of which intervention is considered active. For example, in a trial evaluating light therapy for depression, participants were informed that the study involved testing two different forms of light therapy, whereas the true hypothesis was that bright blue light was considered potentially effective and that dim red light was considered placebo.

Despite its importance, blinding has often been poorly described in trial protocols. Yet, reviews of two samples of 108 and 292 trial protocols from 2016 found that 82% to 94% of protocols addressed the blinding status of participants and care providers, and 68% to 70% reported the blinding status of outcome assessors.

The protocol should explicitly state who will be blinded to intervention groups — at a minimum, the blinding status of trial participants, care providers, and outcome assessors. Such a description is much preferred over the use of ambiguous terminology such as single blind or double blind.

Summary of key elements to address

Who will be blinded to treatment assignments: trial participants; care providers (ie, those administering the intervention); outcome assessors (ie, those who determine whether a participant experienced the outcome of interest), such as the participant (for patient reported outcomes), care provider, or independent observer; and data analysts performing the statistical analysis.

### Effect of a web-based guided self-help intervention for prevention of major depression in adults with subthreshold depression: a randomized clinical trial [^6b59e9a9]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Evidence-based treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD) are not very successful in improving functional and health outcomes. Attention has increasingly been focused on the prevention of MDD.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based guided self-help intervention for the prevention of MDD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Two-group randomized clinical trial conducted between March 1, 2013, and March 4, 2015. Participants were recruited in Germany from the general population via a large statutory health insurance company (ie, insurance funded by joint employer-employee contributions). Participants included 406 self-selected adults with subthreshold depression (Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale score ≥ 16, no current MDD according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [Fourth Edition, Text Revision] criteria).

Interventions

All participants had unrestricted access to usual care (visits to the primary care clinician) and were randomized to either a web-based guided self-help intervention (cognitive-behavioral and problem-solving therapy supported by an online trainer; n = 202) or a web-based psychoeducation program (n = 204).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was time to onset of MDD in the intervention group relative to the control group over a 12-month follow-up period as assessed by blinded diagnostic raters using the telephone-administered Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis Disorders at 6- and 12-month follow-up, covering the period to the previous assessment.

Results

Among 406 randomized patients (mean age, 45 years; 73.9% women), 335 (82%) completed the telephone follow-up at 12 months. Fifty-five participants (27%) in the intervention group experienced MDD compared with 84 participants (41%) in the control group. Cox regression analyses controlling for baseline depressive symptom severity revealed a hazard ratio of 0.59 (95% CI, 0.42–0.82; P = 0.002) at 12-month follow-up. The number needed to treat to avoid 1 new case of MDD was 5.9 (95% CI, 3.9–14.6).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with subthreshold depression, the use of a web-based guided self-help intervention compared with enhanced usual care reduced the incidence of MDD over 12 months. Further research is needed to understand whether the effects are generalizable to both first onset of depression and depression recurrence as well as efficacy without the use of an online trainer.

### Interventions to prevent perinatal depression: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^5bf72a64]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Counseling interventions — effectiveness in preventing perinatal depression: Counseling interventions were associated with a 39% reduction in perinatal depression (pooled relative risk [RR], 0.61 [95% CI, 0.47 to 0.78]); assuming a 19% baseline risk this corresponds to a number needed to treat of 13.5 women (95% CI, 9.9 to 23.9). Subgroup analyses reported pooled RR reductions of 53% and 50% for the "Mothers and Babies" and ROSE programs, respectively, and trials in increased-risk women showed larger effects than unselected populations (45% vs 21% risk reduction). For symptoms, thirteen trials reported continuous symptom score measures, with 5 trials demonstrating a statistically significant group differences, and counseling produced a standardized effect size of 0.20, or an average 1.5-point greater reduced symptoms compared with usual care.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^bf97963d]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Executive summary — scope of guideline for depressive disorders outlines the populations, evidence base, included intervention domains, and exclusions: It is intended to provide recommendations for the treatment of depressive disorders based on systematic reviews of the evidence and addresses three developmental cohorts — children and adolescents, general adults, and older adults (ages 60 and over). Ten systematic reviews and meta-analyses served as the basis for this guideline. It addresses the efficacy of psychological and complementary and alternative medicine treatments and the comparative effectiveness of psychotherapy in combination with pharmacotherapy as well as compared to pharmacotherapy and complementary and alternative treatments, and also addresses harms and burdens of treatment and patient values and preferences. The reviews on which this guideline is based did not specifically address screening for depression, assessment of associated comorbid conditions, monitoring response to treatment, locus of care, prevention of depressive episodes, timing or duration of treatments for depression, costs of treatment, long-term benefits of treatment, mechanisms of change, bipolar disorder, or efficacy of treatments for disorders other than depression, and psychotic depression is not covered by this guideline.

### Considerations and cautions for the integration of psilocybin into routine clinical care: a consensus statement from the US national network of depression centers' task group on psychedelics and related compounds [^e4eb0538]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Uncertainty about most effective dosage

Aside from adverse effects, there is also still relatively little known about optimal dosage to achieve desired therapeutic effects. While a canonical dose of 25 mg has driven therapeutic response in the most recent clinical trials, it is unclear whether this is truly the optimal dose. Likewise, it remains unclear if different indications may maximally benefit from different dosages. Evidence may suggest a higher dose (up to 40 mg of psilocybin) may be necessary in patients with AUD. In addition to questions of drug dosage, similar questions remain regarding the necessity of and best practices for integration of psychotherapy within psilocybin treatment.

Questions about protocol, health economics, scalability, and accessibility

Related to dosage and the combination of psilocybin with therapy, several treatment protocols have been manualised for study purposes. While this allows for more rigorous study and replication, most treatment protocols remain resource-intensive, and there is limited data on what the critical elements contributing to safety and effectiveness are within each protocol. Currently the ability to generalise protocols across indications also remains unclear. If the clinical benefits turn out to require implementation of something resembling the full versions of protocols currently in common use, barriers may emerge to scalable, affordable, and equitable access in routine clinical settings. A recent study estimated that the cost of psilocybin treatment combined with therapy from one therapist would be £5239 (∼$6600) if psilocybin is costed at £1200 (∼$1500), and psilocybin was only determined to be cost-effective compared to other modalities when the cost of therapist support was reduced by 50% and the cost of psilocybin was reduced to £400 (∼$520) per person. In Australia, private insurers have created "proof of concept" psychedelic therapy clinics and are actively evaluating the health economics to assess whether to include these treatments. Additionally, while some have worked to develop roadmaps for coding and billing, many practical questions remain, and self-pay models are already being developed, which could adversely impact equitable access.

Older adults with MDD or minor depression plus cognitive impairment/dementia — there is insufficient evidence for a recommendation regarding the combination of behavioral activation therapy (individual) and treatment as usual over treatment as usual for depressive symptoms. The panel makes no recommendations of one treatment over the other for the treatments in each pair comparison, and decision should be based on shared decision-making with the patient.

Risk of bias within studies

Supplementary file section S5 provides the risk of bias ratings for each study. Few studies explicitly blinded participants and staff (fig 3). As a result, overall risk of bias for most studies was unclear or high, and effect sizes could include expectancy effects, among other biases. However, sensitivity analyses suggested that effect sizes were not influenced by any risk of bias criteria owing to wide credible intervals (see supplementary file, section S6). Nevertheless, certainty ratings for all treatments arms were downgraded owing to high risk of bias in the studies informing the comparison.

### The management of major depressive disorder: synopsis of the 2022 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^91ad3caf]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Measurement-based care (MBC) for major depressive disorder is supported by randomized and meta-analytic evidence but with low overall certainty. In pharmacotherapy settings, patients randomly assigned (n = 120) to treatment enhanced with regular collection of self-reported rating scales had outcomes over 24 weeks that favored MBC for response, remission, time to response, and time to remission, and patients in the MBC arm were more likely to include medication management (switches or augmentation); a primary care pilot reported similar results (n = 47 patients). Additional support includes a trial that demonstrated MBC leads to a greater likelihood of continued treatment than treatment without MBC, although it randomized 664 patients and did not independently measure clinical outcomes. In psychotherapy, a meta-analysis of three trials using patient-reported outcomes found that the positive impact of MBC was greater for patients who were not progressing in therapy. The Work Group stated this is a Reviewed, New-replaced recommendation and that the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low, noting that the potential benefits of MBC, including improved depression symptoms and remission, are balanced by the potential harms (e.g., the burden of collection and the lack of informatic support in many systems); patient values and preferences may favor MBC though there is no strong evidence on this, and thus the Work Group decided upon a Weak for recommendation.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^821cc0e5]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Institute of Medicine (IOM) standards — this guideline's development drew on an independent, newly released systematic review for adults, was supplemented by existing reviews and meta-analyses, and applied AMSTAR quality criteria to existing meta-analyses and reviews, including for child and adolescent literature. To address key questions despite literature limitations, the panel modified its systematic review criteria to include manuscripts with a single rather than dual review process and some reviews that otherwise met IOM requirements, recognizing this as a less methodologically rigorous approach with increased risk of bias. Each review was independently analyzed with AMSTAR, and development took into account the strength of evidence for benefits and harms, the balance of benefit versus harm, patient values and preferences, and applicability.

Depression treatment protocols — treatment fidelity and real-world judgment: The guideline explains that a hallmark of scientifically sound outcome studies is documented adherence to a treatment protocol (treatment fidelity or integrity), and that fidelity protocols make it easier to assess if a treatment was delivered as intended. It notes that in "real-world" contexts complete adherence can be difficult, and that treatment providers must rely on their sound clinical judgment to know when to deviate from a protocol or cease a treatment if it is not working.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^02a21683]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Evaluating the evidence (APA Depression Guideline) — Evidence profiles were created by the RTI-UNC Evidence-based Practice Center team from systematic reviews and include, for each outcome, the number of studies, absolute effect sizes, confidence intervals (when available), and strength of evidence ratings. Decision tables and grids were used to summarize and evaluate evidence, with four main domains documented: (1) strength of evidence; (2) treatment outcomes and the balance of benefits vs. harms and burdens of interventions; (3) patient values and preferences; and (4) applicability of the evidence to various treatment populations. Strength of evidence was rated as either insufficient/very low, low, moderate, or high, and only interventions that had at least low strength of evidence for one of the outcomes were decision tables or grids completed. The panel generated evidence that met the criteria for the completion of 38 decision tables and three grids on which to base the APA Depression Guideline. To improve efficiency while maintaining consistency and transparency, a revised "grid" process was created with distinct columns for separate questions and outcomes and individual decision-making regarding efficacy but shared consideration of the same data for harms and burdens across columns. Although some questioned applicability of randomized trials, the panel decided not to supplement the randomized trials with observational or other treatment studies due to potential confounding bias, but made two significant exceptions when randomized trial data were lacking on two outcomes — (1) harms and burdens of psychological treatments and (2) patient values and preferences regarding particular treatments — and authorized APA staff to compile additional information from the literature on these topics.

### A scalable mental health intervention for depressive symptoms: evidence from a randomized controlled trial and large-scale real-world studies [^f3975621]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study 1: risk management

The suicide risk evaluation protocol employs a validated two-stage screening process consistent with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). During the initial registration phase, all participants complete a preliminary screening comprising two binary-response items (0 = no, 1 = yes) assessing recent suicidal ideation ("Have you experienced suicidal ideation in the past month?") and perceived worthlessness ("Do you currently hold strong beliefs that your life is worthless?"). An affirmative response to either item triggers a secondary assessment involving two additional binary-response items evaluating suicide planning ("Have you formulated a specific suicide plan within the past month?") and means preparation ("Have you acquired means for suicide implementation?"). At each stage, a response is classified as positive if the participant selects "yes" for either question; otherwise, it is classified as negative.

Following risk stratification, participants receive information tailored to their level of suicide risk: (a) those categorized as "no risk" (negative on the first-stage screening) receive access to standard crisis resources, which remain available to them indefinitely; (b) individuals classified as "low risk" (positive on the first stage but negative on the second stage) complete a guided safety planning session utilizing the Stanley-Brown template and confirm their readiness before proceeding. Their safety plan remains accessible via their dashboard throughout the intervention period; (c) participants identified as "potentially high risk" (positive on both the first and second stages) trigger an alert recommending immediate psychiatric evaluation and are strongly advised to seek high-intensity professional assistance (e.g. appropriate medical intervention). All participants receive 24/7 crisis hotline information. For ethical considerations, those classified as high-risk may still be allowed to participate in the study if they provide verifiable proof of seeking professional care.

All personnel involved in participant interaction, including customer service representatives and teaching assistants, undergo regular crisis management training delivered by qualified mental health professionals. Teaching assistants additionally receive continuous group supervision to enhance their crisis intervention skills when supporting at-risk users. Furthermore, while mindfulness exercises may occasionally induce transient physical discomfort or perceived time constraints when practiced daily, these effects typically subside upon discontinuation and do not pose significant harm. Participants in guided intervention programs experiencing such difficulties can access real-time support via group chats or live sessions, whereas those engaged in unguided interventions can refer to online instructional materials provided by the program developers.

### A WHO digital intervention to address depression among young Chinese adults: a type 1 effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial [^5576d37d]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

The main findings regarding the effectiveness of SbS in this trial were generally consistent with the previous feasibility study among Chinese youth, and randomized controlled trials among residents and refugees in Lebanon. In each trial, a greater reduction in depressive symptoms was noted in SbS than enhanced treatment as usual (effect sizes from 0.48 to 0.71). Together these results demonstrate that SbS is an effective intervention to reduce depressive symptoms in several populations and geographic locations where professional mental health service are limited (there are roughly 1.7 PhD-level clinical psychologists or psychiatrists per 100,000 adults in the Chinese speaking population in Macao according to our preliminary desk reviews and interviews with local stakeholders). The current study also extends previous trial results and is the first to show that SbS can address mild depression symptoms. Progress in psychopathology studies has shown that mental disorders like depression exist on a severity spectrum rather than exist as categories Mild, or sub-clinical depression is known to cause significant functional impairment and may develop into a depressive disorder without appropriate treatment. Although SbS was designed as a transdiagnostic intervention for those with more severe depressive conditions, results from our subgroup analyses also provide the first evidence to support SbS as an effective treatment for less severe depression and support its potential use as a preventative intervention. Accordingly, the small effect size observed in the current trial compared to previous trials with moderate effect sizes and the insignificant long-term effects could be due to the floor effect caused by a lower baseline depressive symptom in our trial. An investigation of SbS on long-term mental health (e.g. symptoms or profile) among young adults with mild symptoms would provide further evidence of its effectiveness as a prevention program.

Partly consistent with our hypothesis, the SbS has a short-term effectiveness in improving anxiety symptoms, but the effect size was smaller than depressive symptoms. The long-term effectiveness on anxiety was also nonsignificant. We did not find any evidence supporting the effectiveness of SbS in solving self-defined psychosocial problems. SbS was initially developed as a guided online self-help version of Problem Management Plus (PM+), another WHO transdiagnostic intervention for adults suffering from mental distress and self-identified practical problems. However, because the problem management component of PM+ could not be easily adapted for the online version, SbS specifically focuses on behavioral activation to reduce depressive symptoms and thus was less transdiagnostic than it was intended to be. This might explain why SbS was less effective in reducing anxiety symptoms than depression symptoms and did not reduce self-defined psychosocial problems.

### Are web-based stress management interventions effective as an indirect treatment for depression? An individual participant data meta-analysis of six randomised trials [^7a10a014]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

User safety is important when web-based SMIs are used 'off-label' in the treatment of depression. Notably, the deterioration rate was low (2.87%) and comparable with direct web-based interventions for depression (3.57%). Overall, there were no indications that the indirect treatment approach might be more harmful than direct treatment.

User satisfaction was slightly higher when personal support was available, and identical or higher than direct web-based interventions targeting depression prevention, diabetesand formally diagnosed depression.

IPD network meta-analysis estimated benefits of the 'fully' guided intervention at d = −0.82, with lower effects for adherence-focused guidance (d = −0.48) and for unguided treatment (d = −0.57). However, CrIs of estimates were wide and included zero. Nevertheless, our findings imply a low (35%) posterior probability that the fully guided and unguided formats produce equivalent effects, and the majority preferred the guided format. In contrast, adherence-focused guidance might not provide relevant benefits, and very few patients in this condition made use of this opportunity.

The dose–response relationship indicated that post-treatment depression scores were linearly associated with the number of completed sessions, emphasising the importance of adherence. Importantly, while plausible, this analysis alone cannot show if some intervention components have 'specific' effects on depression. It is also possible that the intervention primarily reduces perceived stress, which ameliorates depressive symptoms; or that even more complex working factors are at play. Component network meta-analyses or fractional factorial designs could allow to illuminate this in the future.

Several limitations should be considered. First, the specific SMI we examined in this study might not be representative of other SMIs that include different techniques. Second, included patients were not diagnosed using a diagnostic interview. Third, adverse events other than reliable symptom deterioration were not considered. Fourth, while we found effect sizes comparable with direct interventions for depression, clinical trials with head-to-head comparisons are needed to confirm the non-inferiority of indirect treatment. This is important because all included trials used waitlist comparators, which could have inflated effect estimates. It could also allow to examine between-group effects for patients with similar adherence levels, which was not possible in the current dose–response analysis. Lastly, the user satisfaction found in this study does not imply a generally higher intention to engage in indirect interventions compared with those explicitly targeting depression.

Guideline recommendations for underserved populations — the fifth goal was to provide appropriate recommendations for underserved populations, but randomized controlled trials included in the reviews had limited information to inform such recommendations. Despite extensive efforts to draw guidance from the available literature, the panel called for increased dedication to RCTs specifically studying diverse samples and highlighted the need to explicitly address differences in culture, ethnicity, sex, sexual minority, gender identity, disability, nationality of origin, generation status, race, socioeconomic status, and their intersections that can influence treatment. These areas could contribute to the experience and treatment of depression but lacked adequate literature, and the panel developed recommendations for future research to address observed gaps and limitations.

### There are no randomized controlled trials that support the United States preventive services task force guideline on screening for depression in primary care: a systematic review [^0b311040]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We did not find any directly relevant evidence from RCTs to support the USPSTF recommendation to screen patients for depression in primary care when staff-assisted, collaborative depression care programs are in place. This result is consistent with recent guidelines from the UK and Canada that concluded that routine depression screening is not supported by existing evidence. Our results differ from those of a 2008 Cochrane review, which reported that depression screening is not effective based on evidence from five trials by clarifying that there have not been any well-designed trials to directly address the question of whether depression screening may be effective, particularly in the context of collaborative care. RCTs of depression screening that are designed to directly assess whether screening of previously unidentified patients will reduce rates of depression are needed.

Over-diagnosis and over-treatment of depression are common in community and primary care settings in the US, and there is a real risk that depression screening could exacerbate this problem without contributing to better mental health. We hope that the USPSTF will re-evaluate evidence on depression screening, applying the three basic criteria that we have used in this review. Before screening for depression is recommended, there should be evidence of improved depression outcomes from well-conducted depression RCTs that are directly relevant to the question of screening.

Although our findings show that there is not enough evidence to recommend that healthcare practitioners use screening to attempt to identify patients who may have depression, depression is a disabling condition with a major impact on quality of life. Thus, clinicians should be aware of signs that depression may be present, such as low mood, loss of interest in activities, insomnia and fatigue. Healthcare practitioners should be particularly vigilant among patients who may be at high risk of depression, including patients with a chronic medical condition, a past history of depression, a pattern of unexplained somatic symptoms and frequent use of medical services, or substance abuse.

Outcomes of interest and evidence considerations for MDD acute-phase treatments note that "The CGC and the CGC Public Panel independently rated the importance of clinical outcomes and prioritized the following outcomes as critical: reduction of suicidal ideas or behaviors, remission, response to treatment, functional capacity, quality of life, reduction of mental suffering, and serious adverse events". The guideline further states, "When developing the recommendations, the CGC prioritized interventions with no increase in serious adverse events that showed improvement or no difference in remission and response compared with SGAs", and that "The CGC judged the overall comparative effectiveness of each intervention by considering the effect sizes and certainty of evidence across all outcomes".

### Addressing social determinants of health in individuals with mental disorders in clinical practice: review and recommendations [^7a1ec8ba]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Case (or Care) management programs use case managers (trained practitioners or navigators, often social workers) who evaluate, plan, implement, coordinate, and prioritize services based on an individual's needs and offer support in close collaboration with health, social, and community partners. The Veterans Health Administration has been increasingly focusing on case management or coaching with the goal of promoting whole health, defined as physical, behavioral, spiritual, and socioeconomic well-being as defined by the individuals themselves. A systematic review and meta-analysis of empirical studies in adults with mental disorders found that care management was associated with small but statistically significant improvements in psychiatric symptoms, mental and overall quality of life, and reduction in inpatient psychiatric hospital days.

There are several models of care management) that have been shown to be more effective than usual care in the treatment of late-life depression. For example, the Improving Mood–Promoting Access to Collaborative Treatment (IMPACT) collaborative care management program and the Prevention of Suicide in Primary Care Elderly: Collaborative Trial (PROSPECT) programs have been found to be significantly more effective than usual care for late-life depression. While care managers do not directly offer case management, they often connect their patients with social agencies available in their communities. There are different models of CM and it is important to pick the right model for the right situation in older adults with depression and other mental health conditions.

The University of Pennsylvania's person-centered care planning (PCCP) program seeks to promote integrated and recovery-oriented services based on an individual's most-valued life goals. The PCCP training uses a train-the-trainers model with supervisors as the primary target to prepare them to train their direct care teams. Providers learn how to elicit and empathize with clients' subjective experiences and how to help clients identify and articulate their interests, preferences, and personal recovery goals in the service plan. A 12-month cluster-randomized controlled trial of PCCP training in community mental health clinics showed significant improvements in delivering person-centered care compared with the control group. At 18 months, this effect was even more pronounced, representing a medium-to-large effect size (d = 0.71).

### The management of major depressive disorder: synopsis of the 2022 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^1f005274]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — determining recommendation strength and direction follows GRADE across domains including confidence in the quality of the evidence (options include High, Moderate, Low, or Very low, and if quality differs across critical outcomes, the lowest quality determines the overall rating), balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes (options include benefits outweigh harms/burden, benefits slightly outweigh harms/burden, benefits and harms/burdens are balanced, harms/burdens slightly outweigh benefits, and harms/burdens outweigh benefits; this assumes most clinicians will offer an intervention if advantages exceed harms), patient values and preferences (options include similar values, some variation, or large variation; homogeneous values may increase a recommendation's strength while heterogeneous values may decrease it, and the Work Group considered findings from a patient focus group), and other implications (options include resource use, equity, acceptability, feasibility, and subgroup considerations). The recommendation strength generally aligns with the confidence in the quality of evidence — Strong recommendations are typically supported by High or Moderate quality evidence — however, GRADE permits Low or Very low quality evidence to support a Strong recommendation in certain instances (e.g., life-threatening situation).

### Technology delivered interventions for depression and anxiety in children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4209c2a2]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2019). Medium credibility.

Previous evidence demonstrates mixed results regarding the role of therapeutic support in e-Health interventions. In adult populations, meta-analyses consistently demonstrate that therapist supported programs produce larger effect sizes than programs that provide no therapist support (Johansson and Andersson; Richards and Richardson). For children and adolescents, findings from Pennant et al. indicated no significant difference between programs for depression with 'minimal' vs. 'some' therapist input. Other evidence suggests that for programs targeting anxiety, 'minimally' supported interventions yield larger effect sizes than 'significantly' supported programs (Podina et al.). Our analysis found that effect size was related to therapeutic support, specifically, minimal contact therapies (more than 90 min) yielded higher effect sizes than purely self-administered interventions. In traditional face to face therapies, a body of research has supported the role of 'common factors', such as the working alliance, in producing positive therapeutic outcomes (Lambert). It is logical therefore that the more opportunity for interaction there is with a therapist in technology-based interventions, the more scope there is to build a therapeutic relationship, thereby improving outcomes. Therapeutic support has also been identified as a moderating factor influencing engagement as well as therapeutic outcomes (Hollis et al; Rickwood and Bradford). Therefore, therapeutic support is also likely to improve engagement and motivation to continue using technology-based interventions. These findings extend those of Richards and Richardson to a child and adolescent population.

### SPIRIT 2013 explanation and elaboration: guidance for protocols of clinical trials [^f335b4b4]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Many groups can be blinded: trial participants, care providers, data collectors, outcome assessors or committees (Item 5d), data analysts, and manuscript writers. Blinding of data monitoring committees is generally discouraged.

When blinding of trial participants and care providers is not possible because of obvious differences between the interventions, blinding of the outcome assessors can often still be implemented. It may also be possible to blind participants or trial personnel to the study hypothesis in terms of which intervention is considered active. For example, in a trial evaluating light therapy for depression, participants were informed that the study involved testing two different forms of light therapy, whereas the true hypothesis was that bright blue light was considered potentially effective and that dim red light was considered placebo.

Despite its importance, blinding is often poorly described in trial protocols. The protocol should explicitly state who will be blinded to intervention groups — at a minimum, the blinding status of trial participants, care providers, and outcome assessors. Such a description is much preferred over the use of ambiguous terminology such as "single blind" or "double blind". Protocols should also describe the comparability of blinded interventions (Item 11a) — for example, similarities in appearance, use of specific flavours to mask a distinctive taste — and the timing of final unblinding of all trial participants (eg, after the creation of a locked analysis data set).

Furthermore, any strategies to reduce the potential for unblinding should be described in the protocol, such as pre-trial testing of blinding procedures. The use of a fixed code (versus a unique code for each participant) to denote each study group assignment (eg, A = Group 1; B = Group 2) can be problematic, as the unblinding of one participant will result in the inadvertent loss of blinding for all trial participants.

Some have suggested that the success of blinding be formally tested by asking key trial persons to guess the study group assignment and comparing these responses to what would be expected by chance. However, it is unclear how best to interpret the results of such tests. If done, the planned testing methods should be described in the trial protocol.

### App-based interventions for moderate to severe depression… [^367b26a0]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 randomized clinical trials of app interventions with 1470 participants found a significant medium effect size for moderate to severe depression, with some variation in effect sizes depending on the characteristics of the population and study design and the components of the intervention program. Meaning These findings underscore the efficacy of mobile app interventions for moderate and severe depression both as standalone interventions and adjuncts to conventional treatments and provide confidence that refining the design of intervention programs can further enhance their effectiveness. Main Outcomes and Measures The main outcome was changes in depression symptom severity from before to after treatment, measured by standardized depression assessment instruments. Secondary outcomes included study-, intervention-, and patient-level factors associated with app efficacy. Results.

In addition, participants receiving ongoing psychotherapy or psychotropic medications showed significantly smaller effect sizes than those who did not receive any ongoing treatments. Furthermore, participants with Western ethnicities showed a significantly smaller effect size than those with non-Western ethnicities. -0. 60 vs SMD,
0. 71; 95% CI, 0. 54–0. 87; Q = 
5. 24; P = 0. 02) showed significant group differences, with the effect sizes favoring apps without professional support and without in-app notifications. In addition, we found that shorter interventions were associated with greater treatment efficacy, although previous meta-analyses have not found significant associations between the length and outcome of interventions. 21, 22, 53, 54 Other studies have reported that longer interventions were not associated with greater benefits than shorter ones.

55, 56 Therefore, our findings recommend developing app-based programs that are shorter than 8 weeks to optimize the effectiveness of depression treatment and to reduce the financial and psychological burdens on the participants. First, our study supported the findings of the systematic review of Firth et al, 22 demonstrating significant treatment effect sizes of app-based programs both with and without professional support, with the effect size favoring studies without professional support. This finding highlights the potential for app-based interventions to produce positive outcomes for individuals struggling with moderate and severe depression, even without professional support. Some studies contradicted our results, 20, 27 which may have been due to our study limiting the depression severity to moderate and severe.

### Mental health gap action programme (mhGAP) guideline for mental, neurological and substance use disorders [^100108f1]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for major depressive disorder, more specifically with respect to initial therapy, WHO 2023 guidelines recommend to consider offering psychological interventions or combined treatment in adults with moderate-to-severe depression based on individual preferences and careful consideration of the balance of benefits and harms. Consider offering monotherapy with antidepressants only when psychological interventions are not available while keeping in mind the possible adverse effects associated with antidepressants and individual preferences.

Comparison of outcomes at follow up between classes

Overall, longer-term self- and observed-reported outcomes were superior in the strong improver group, then the delayed/plateau groups, then the non-improver group then the worsening group. At 8 weeks post-randomisation (approximately 4 weeks after the end of the treatment course), reduction in observer-reported depressive symptoms (HDRS-17) was significantly greater in all improver groups than in the worsening group (Fig. 3A). HDRS-17 reduction was also significantly greater in the strong- and delayed-improver groups than in the non-improver group, and in the strong-improver group than in the delayed-improver and plateau groups. These effects were largely sustained at 16- and 26-weeks post-randomisation. It is notable that some degree of improvement was observed even in the non-improver group. However, none of the participants in the "worsening" class were HDRS-17 responders (at least 50% score reduction) at any time point (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. 3). Similar patterns were seen for self-reported depressive (BDI-II, Fig. 3C; PHQ-9, Supplementary Fig. 4A) and anxiety symptoms (GAD-7, Fig. 3D), as well as social and occupational functioning (WSAS, Supplementary Fig. 4B).

### Influence of initial severity of depression on effectiveness of low intensity interventions: meta-analysis of individual patient data [^a6cdef8b]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Analysis

As individual patient data meta-analyses are vulnerable to publication bias from a number of sources, two authors independently extracted data on populations, interventions, methodological quality (based on assessment of allocation concealment, intention to treat analysis, and attrition) and outcome effect sizes for all studies identified by the searches, so as to compare the studies where data were available to us with those where data were unavailable. We present descriptive statistics on study characteristics (including quality, in terms of concealment of allocation, reporting of intention to treat analysis, and attrition rates of < 20%). We also assessed the potential for publication bias using funnel plots, in line with published recommendations. We also extracted data on moderator analyses in published studies to allow further comparisons.

There are three methods of analysing moderator effects in meta-analysis: aggregate data analysis through meta-regression; using individual patient data to estimate the treatment-moderator interaction within each study, followed by a standard inverse variance meta-analysis ("two step analysis"); and analysis of individual patient data using a mixed model and accounting for clustering of patients within studies ("one step analysis"). In certain situations these last two analyses give identical results, although they differ under conditions such as "covariate heterogeneity" (that is, the variation in the covariate within each study).

In this study we used the one step analysis, which is the most logistically demanding but which allows for sophisticated modelling of covariates (in this case, age, sex, and baseline severity), is least affected by bias, and is most efficient in terms of power. Appropriate mixed effects models (with fixed trial-specific intercepts for the interaction, a random treatment effect, and fixed trial-specific effects for baseline) were used to synthesise the patient level data and estimate the variances between and within studies, fitting the interaction as a continuous variable. We also repeated these analyses with different meta-analytic models (random trial intercept; random treatment effect; fixed trial-specific effects for baseline). We used Stata v12.1 and a restricted maximum likelihood algorithm with the "xtmixed" command. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 statistic. For cluster randomised studies, we adjusted appropriately. Where studies involved multiple treatment comparisons with a single control, we treated each comparison separately, and we avoided double counting controls by assigning half the controls at random to each comparison.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^41667251]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Implications of alignment with Institute of Medicine (IOM) standards — evidence selection and limitations — explain that "the current clinical practice guideline development panel adopted the Institute of Medicine's (2011a) standards for guideline development", and that to follow these standards "it was important to generally include reviews that involved more than one individual to screen and select studies to include in the review, as well as to extract quantitative data from each study". The document notes "IOM notes that systematic reviews become outdated at 5.5 years", that "Following such guidance restricted our ability to incorporate those reviews that did not meet such standards", and that when this caused major gaps "we did include meta-analyses that did not conform to such standards but that did meet quality criteria per AMSTAR review". It acknowledges that "developing clinical practice guidelines that are 'trustworthy' can be difficult", and justifies using IOM guidance because "the answer is 'yes' given that the ultimate goal is to produce a scientifically sound clinical practice guideline".

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^9538dfe2]. DoD/VA (2023). High credibility.

VA/DoD bipolar disorder — light therapy as augmentation: In individuals with bipolar 1 or bipolar 2 disorder, we suggest offering short-term light therapy as augmentation to pharmacotherapy for treatment of bipolar depression. The Work Group categorized this as Reviewed, New-added, with confidence in the quality of the evidence low for outcomes of depression and clinical response and very low for clinical remission and affective switch rates; they determined that the potential benefits slightly outweighed the potential harm, and noted that patient values and preferences varied largely because light therapy can be burdensome in terms of time commitment and active monitoring requirements.
