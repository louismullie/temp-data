## Question

Chronic outlet obstruction

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about chronic outlet obstruction. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining chronic outlet obstruction and its clinical contexts. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and staging model. Next, I will review diagnostic strategies, including urodynamics and imaging. After that, I need to examine management by etiology, including male BPH, female functional/anatomic BOO, and neurogenic DSD. Finally, I should consider prognosis, reversibility, and special populations, and close with a concise synthesis and key takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the definition and clinical contexts. Chronic outlet obstruction refers to a persistent impediment to urine flow from the bladder through the urethra, most commonly due to benign prostatic obstruction in men, but also encompassing urethral stricture, primary bladder neck obstruction, pelvic organ prolapse, and functional causes such as detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia; in women, iatrogenic obstruction after incontinence surgery is a frequent contributor, and in children, posterior urethral valves are the leading cause [^c15ed894] [^7235354e] [^ad292734].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology and staging model. Wait, let me verify the canonical sequence: a three-stage model is consistently described — hypertrophy, compensation, and decompensation — driven by chronic mechanical stress, ischemia-reperfusion injury, oxidative stress, and neurogenic changes; early hypertrophy and increased contractility can coexist with detrusor overactivity, while prolonged obstruction leads to fibrosis, denervation, and detrusor underactivity, with age of onset, severity, and comorbidities influencing the timeline to decompensation [^7d0af733] [^b863834d] [^1519584a] [^d0d020d9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about reversibility. I should confirm the evidence base. Human data suggest that functional recovery after de-obstruction is variable; while pressure-flow parameters often improve, detrusor underactivity may persist in a substantial subset, and prolonged obstruction with large-volume retention portends lower likelihood of recovery; molecular studies in humans show progressive gene expression changes that align with fibrosis and loss of contractility, reinforcing the concept of a point of no return in some patients [^56b35029] [^04b7e315] [^9795aab3].

> Next, I should review diagnostic strategy. I need to ensure I anchor on high-quality evidence. Symptoms alone are insufficient to diagnose BOO; urodynamic pressure-flow studies remain the reference standard, with the Abrams-Griffiths nomogram and BOOI/BCI informing obstruction and contractility, respectively; noninvasive measures such as uroflowmetry, postvoid residual, and bladder scan correlate with catheterized volumes and help screen for retention; in women, videourodynamics and cystoscopy are often required to distinguish anatomic from functional obstruction, and MRI can delineate complex pelvic anatomy; in men, IPSS thresholds around 20 modestly increase the likelihood of BOO but should not be used in isolation [^d3a205fd] [^c15ed894] [^7235354e] [^4709708f].

> Let me consider male BPH-related BOO management. I should double-check guideline direction. Medical therapy with alpha-1 blockers and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors reduces outlet resistance and can modestly reduce detrusor wall thickness, but symptoms may persist if remodeling is advanced; surgical options such as TURP, laser enucleation, or waterjet ablation improve flow and symptoms across prostate sizes, though storage symptoms may lag as detrusor remodeling resolves; importantly, an elevated PVR alone should not dictate surgery, and patients with chronic retention require evaluation for renal compromise and infection risk before intervention [^56b35029] [^30b29fc6] [^05bf7029] [^d47643b4].

> For female BOO, I need to check both functional and anatomic pathways. Functional BOO due to pelvic floor dyssynergia or primary bladder neck obstruction may respond to pelvic floor muscle relaxation training and, in selected cases, oral baclofen; uroselective alpha-blockers can be considered after shared decision-making, though evidence is limited; anatomic causes such as urethral stricture or iatrogenic obstruction often require urethral dilation, internal urethrotomy with self-dilation, or urethroplasty, with counseling on recurrence and continence risks; bladder neck incision is reserved for primary bladder neck obstruction with careful counseling on potential stress incontinence and stricture [^f4bf2ea8] [^da8be35c] [^18de0b14] [^cd34d0e4] [^708b7855] [^fd450a78] [^2f899b41] [^5dc135ce].

> For neurogenic DSD, I should confirm the surgical evidence. Botulinum toxin injection to the external sphincter improves urodynamic parameters and reduces residuals in small RCTs, but effects wane and reinjection is needed; sphincterotomy lowers voiding pressures more durably but carries irreversibility and incontinence risks; guideline-based care emphasizes individualized selection and close follow-up given the limited high-quality comparative data [^2eb879fd] [^6244ef00].

> I need to ensure I address prognosis and the timing of intervention. Early de-obstruction improves the likelihood of functional recovery, whereas prolonged obstruction with detrusor underactivity and fibrosis limits reversibility; persistent storage symptoms after relief of obstruction reflect ongoing detrusor remodeling and neurogenic changes, and in children with PUV, even after valve ablation, a high proportion have long-term bladder dysfunction, underscoring the need for longitudinal urologic and nephrologic surveillance [^56b35029] [^7d0af733] [^ad292734].

> But wait, what about special populations and emerging insights. In pediatrics, prenatal detection of severe bilateral urinary tract dilation mandates evaluation for BOO and early postnatal decompression; in adults with complex pelvic anatomy or prior surgery, MRI and videourodynamics refine diagnosis; and while animal data suggest antioxidant or HIF-pathway modulation may mitigate obstruction-related injury, translation to humans remains investigational, so I should caution against extrapolation to routine care [^ace94fc5] [^4709708f] [^a1b8ae00] [^f6632d2d].

> Let me reconsider the key takeaways to ensure internal consistency. Chronic outlet obstruction is a progressive disease with a staged remodeling sequence; accurate diagnosis relies on urodynamics rather than symptoms alone; management must be etiology-specific, with medical therapy appropriate for BPH and functional female BOO, and surgical de-obstruction for anatomic lesions or refractory cases; timing matters because delayed treatment risks irreversible detrusor decompensation; and persistent symptoms after de-obstruction reflect structural and neurogenic changes that may require adjunctive therapies and long-term follow-up [^c15ed894] [^7d0af733] [^30b29fc6] [^7235354e] [^56b35029].

Chronic outlet obstruction is a persistent blockage of urine flow from the bladder, most often due to **benign prostatic hyperplasia** in men [^c15ed894], but also from urethral strictures, bladder neck obstruction, or neurogenic causes [^4b0a1aee]. It leads to **bladder remodeling** with hypertrophy, fibrosis, and detrusor dysfunction, progressing from compensation to decompensation [^7d0af733] [^d0d020d9]. Clinically, patients present with weak stream, straining, incomplete emptying, frequency, urgency, and nocturia; complications include urinary retention, infections, stones, and renal impairment [^c15ed894] [^30b29fc6]. Diagnosis relies on uroflowmetry, postvoid residual, and pressure-flow urodynamics [^d3a205fd]; management includes medical therapy (alpha-blockers, 5α-reductase inhibitors), minimally invasive procedures, or surgery (TURP, laser therapy) [^30b29fc6], with outcomes dependent on obstruction severity and timing of intervention [^56b35029].

---

## Pathophysiology

Chronic outlet obstruction triggers **bladder remodeling** through three phases: hypertrophy, compensation, and decompensation [^7d0af733] [^d0d020d9]. Initially, the detrusor hypertrophies to overcome resistance, maintaining near-normal function (compensation) [^7d0af733]. With persistent obstruction, ischemia, oxidative stress, and fibrosis develop, leading to decompensation with detrusor underactivity and impaired emptying [^12a51f3c] [^0e8843b6]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Mechanical stress**: Increased intravesical pressure causes smooth muscle hypertrophy and extracellular matrix remodeling [^1519584a].
- **Ischemia-reperfusion injury**: Cyclic ischemia during filling/voiding drives oxidative stress and fibrosis [^12a51f3c].
- **Neurogenic changes**: Loss of intrinsic neurons and altered neurotransmitter signaling contribute to detrusor dysfunction [^98ae25c1].

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients with chronic outlet obstruction typically present with:

- **Voiding symptoms**: Weak stream, straining, hesitancy, intermittency, incomplete emptying [^c15ed894].
- **Storage symptoms**: Frequency, urgency, nocturia, occasional incontinence [^c15ed894].
- **Complications**: Acute urinary retention, recurrent UTIs, bladder stones, hydronephrosis, and renal impairment [^30b29fc6].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Accurate diagnosis requires a **combination of clinical assessment and objective testing**:

| **Diagnostic modality** | **Role in evaluation** |
|-|-|
| History and physical exam | Identify risk factors, symptom severity, and potential causes [^c15ed894] |
| Uroflowmetry | Reduced peak flow rate (< 10 mL/s) suggests obstruction [^notfound] |
| Postvoid residual (PVR) | Elevated PVR (> 100 mL) indicates incomplete emptying [^notfound] |
| Pressure-flow urodynamics | Gold standard; detrusor pressure > 40 cm H2O with Qmax < 12 mL/s defines obstruction [^notfound] |
| Imaging (ultrasound, MRI) | Assess prostate size, bladder wall thickness, stones, or anatomical abnormalities [^2bc5bbf5] |

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on severity, cause, and patient factors; **early intervention improves outcomes** [^56b35029].

---

### Medical management

Medical therapy is **first-line** for mild-to-moderate obstruction or as a bridge to definitive therapy:

- **Alpha-blockers**: Terazosin, tamsulosin, alfuzosin reduce smooth muscle tone and improve flow [^1ee54a43] [^8ff7c27a].
- **5α-reductase inhibitors**: Finasteride, dutasteride shrink prostate and reduce obstruction over months [^notfound].
- **Combination therapy**: Alpha-blocker plus 5α-reductase inhibitor for moderate-to-severe LUTS [^notfound].

---

### Surgical management

Surgery is indicated for **severe obstruction**, medical therapy failure, or complications:

- **Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)**: Gold standard for BPH-related obstruction [^notfound].
- **Laser therapies**: Holmium laser enucleation (HoLEP), greenlight photoselective vaporization (PVP) offer effective alternatives with lower bleeding risk [^ce6caffc].
- **Urethral procedures**: Dilation, internal urethrotomy, or urethroplasty for strictures [^708b7855] [^fd450a78].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis varies with obstruction severity, duration, and treatment timing. Early relief improves **reversibility of detrusor dysfunction**; delayed treatment risks permanent decompensation [^56b35029]. Persistent obstruction can cause **renal impairment** from hydronephrosis and chronic retention [^30b29fc6].

---

## Special considerations

- **Female patients**: BOO is underrecognized; causes include iatrogenic obstruction, urethral stricture, and pelvic organ prolapse [^7235354e] [^40747cf5].
- **Pediatric patients**: Posterior urethral valves are the most common cause, requiring early intervention to prevent renal damage [^ad292734] [^ace94fc5].
- **Neurogenic bladder**: Detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia requires specialized management, including botulinum toxin or sphincterotomy [^2eb879fd].

---

Chronic outlet obstruction is a progressive condition with significant morbidity if untreated. Early diagnosis and **targeted therapy** — medical or surgical — are essential to prevent irreversible bladder dysfunction and renal injury [^7d0af733].

Abstract

Studies on bladder dysfunction (BD), more specifically functional‐urodynamic changes in the bladder as a result of bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) have been summarized for this TT. Based on available, but limited evidence from human studies a three‐stage model can be hypothesized to characterize BOO‐induced bladder remodeling: hypertrophy, compensation (increased detrusor contractility during the voiding phase, often in combination with filling phase detrusor overactivity) followed by the phase of decompensation [detrusor underactivity]. The time between the start of compensation and eventual decompensation seems to be determined by age of onset, severity, and type of obstruction and clinical mitigating factors such as vascular and metabolic problems. Understanding the relative contributions of these factors may allow the development of personalized timelines and probabilities for these obstructed patients.

1 INTRODUCTION

Most studies on functional‐urodynamic changes in the bladder as a result of bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) have been done in the aging male with benign prostatic obstruction (BPO). Other prevalent causes of BOO include bladder neck obstruction (BNO), posterior urethral valves (PUV), and urethral strictures (US). Conceptually, bladder dysfunction (BD) might be induced by BOO but alternatively could be pre‐existing; also, a combination of these factors might be possible. BPO‐ or BOO‐associated BD has been classified as follows: (a) detrusor overactivity (DO) with or without reduced bladder compliance, (b) detrusor underactivity (DU) or (c) mixed pattern. 1 BD is clinically relevant, since it persists in up to one‐third of men after transurethral resection of the prostate. 2

This leads to several questions as follows:
1 How might BOO lead to BD and more particularly what is its structural, histological and biochemical background?
2 Is BD reversible after treatment of BOO and if so, is this always the case? In other words, can the detrusor recover after treatment?
3 If detrusor function does not recover, why is this? Is there a certain period of exposure to BOO that predisposes to nonrecovery or decompensation of the bladder? And if so, how can this point of no return be characterized? Or is decompensation mainly related to acute or acute on chronic retention?

Is age of onset of BOO relevant? Are any clinical mitigating factors involved?

These are the proceedings of the Think Tank: “ Do functional changes occur in the bladder due to bladder outlet obstruction? ” from the 2018 International Consultation on Incontinence‐Research Society (ICI‐RS) meeting.

7 WHEN AND UNDER WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES IS THE RECOVERY OF THE BLADDER POSSIBLE AFTER TREATMENT OF BOO?

Several studies have evaluated the effects of pharmacologic treatment for BPO on BWT. Treatment with α‐blockers has been shown to significantly reduce BWT in various studies. 37, 38, 39 De Nunzio et al 40 evaluated the effect of dutasteride add‐on therapy in patients with 27 “BPH” already being treated with α‐blockers. 40 After 24 weeks of treatment, they observed a significant reduction in DWT. Unfortunately, no correlation with the results of pressure‐flow studies and DWT measurements have been reported.

Regarding BWT and surgery, one study evaluated 51 patients with “BPH” who underwent transurethral resection of the prostate: a very small but statistically significant reduction in DWT 1 month after surgery was found. Patients with larger prostates and a high degree of obstruction showed the greatest reduction. 41

Functional changes in the bladder due to bladder outlet obstruction may not revert to normal after treatment: Thomas et al 42 could not demonstrate any long‐term symptomatic or urodynamic gains from TURP in men with both BPO and detrusor underactivity. On the other hand, decompensation was rare in this relatively small and selected group of untreated BPO patients with DU. 42 In the majority of older men presenting with large volume chronic retention and acute on chronic retention, bladder contractility may be beyond recovery as shown by a study that followed 228 men who were catheterized after going into acute retention: The cumulative rate of recurrent retention was 56% after 1 week and 68% after 1 year. 43

### Effect of chronic bladder outlet obstruction on blood flow of the rabbit bladder [^cd3c8cc5]. The Journal of Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

Previous studies have shown that the initial reaction of the rabbit bladder to partial bladder outlet obstruction is increased blood flow at day 1 and a return to baseline blood flow at 1 week. Mucosal and muscle blood flow followed this pattern but mucosal blood flow was always 4 to 5-fold greater. In this study we examined the effect of 4 weeks of outlet obstruction on bladder blood flow and correlated it with the severity of bladder contractile dysfunction.

Materials and Methods

A total of 14 male New Zealand White rabbits underwent partial outlet obstruction creation by standard methods. After 4 weeks the rabbits were anesthetized, and blood flow to the muscle and mucosa was determined by standard fluorescent microsphere technique. A section of each detrusor was used for in vitro contractility studies. Contractile responses to field stimulation, carbachol and potassium chloride were determined. A section of each detrusor tissue was fixed in formalin and used to determine the smooth muscle volume fraction.

Results

Four weeks of partial bladder outlet obstruction caused a significant and variable increase in bladder weight and a decrease in blood flow to bladder muscle without changes in the blood flow to mucosa. There was a clear correlation between the severity of contractile dysfunction, bladder weight and the magnitude of the decrease in blood flow in muscle. The smooth muscle volume fraction remained stable at approximately 40%.

Conclusions

Bladder decompensation was associated with decreased blood flow to bladder smooth muscle. Because compensated obstructed bladders with relatively normal contractile function are also hypertrophied but have normal blood flow, decreased blood flow in decompensated bladders is not simply a response to bladder hypertrophy. From this study we hypothesize that decreased blood flow to bladder smooth muscle is an etiological factor in bladder contractile dysfunction (bladder decompensation) secondary to partial outlet obstruction.

### Diagnosis and management of outlet obstruction in the female [^7235354e]. Current Opinion in Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Bladder outlet obstruction in women results from a remarkable diversity of underlying pathologies. The potential array of presenting symptoms often makes the diagnosis complex, although the condition is predominantly assessed by the urologist as a consequence of incontinence surgery. Recent advances in the diagnosis and management of outlet obstruction in women and the impact on clinical practice are outlined. Recent trials have defined the importance of early intervention for successful resolution of acute, surgically induced obstruction in women. Methods of management for persistent symptoms due to induced obstruction have been reported that render improved symptomatic response.

Recent Findings

We present strategies for diagnostic evaluation of bladder outlet obstruction, including history taking and physical exam, as well as a review of appropriate imaging modalities and utilization of videourodynamics. Common conditions resulting in bladder outlet obstruction are discussed along with disease-specific treatment strategies. Diagnostic definitions of obstruction have evolved and improved nomograms have been developed to define study populations.

Summary

Recent data have underscored the need for a structured management algorithm. Areas of future research should focus on understanding the natural history of outlet obstruction in women, especially when it occurs in women who have undergone surgery for incontinence and have developed obstruction. Lower urinary tract response to acute obstruction and method of optimal management remain to be defined.

### Effect of bladder filling volume on detrusor contractility in men with bladder outlet obstruction [^79d667d7]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2023). Medium credibility.

This study has several limitations. The different thresholds of bladder capacity were chosen arbitrarily to perform the stop‐tests (50%, 75%, and 100% of capacity). Thus, it was not possible to estimate contractility regardless of the bladder filling volume or to determine the optimal volume leading to the maximum contractility. Urodynamics and even more pressure‐flow studies do not reproduce the physiological conditions of filling and micturition and can therefore impact the ability to empty the bladder. However, as the subject was his own witness, this bias had little influence on the analysis. The stop‐test technique to measure detrusor contractility was performed at the very beginning of the void. Indeed, as the study was about the influence of the filling volume, the bladder volume at the time of the stop‐tests had to be perfectly controlled. Most studies performed the stop‐test in the middle of micturition, which may complicate the comparison of results.Finally, the order of filling volumes was not randomized and the stop‐tests were always performed in the same order. It has been suggested that the repetition of the measurements could lead to detrusor fatigue and therefore a decrease in the observed contractility,but the initial increase observed at 75% does not support this hypothesis and because of the relatively small number of measurements, the impact on the results is probably small.

This study opens several perspectives. First, the demonstration of the impact of bladder filling volume on contractility allows a better understanding of the phenomena of urinary retention in male patients with a bladder outlet obstruction. It also demonstrates the variability of the data obtained according to the conditions of the examination. Thus, the conditions to assess bladder contractility can impact the results, depending on the choice of the technique (nomogram vs. stop‐test), or the mode of realization (filling volume to optimize the pressure‐flow study, with normal desire to void vs. maximum capacity), and it would be interesting to define the optimal conditions. Finally, in clinical practice and real‐life management, this study suggests the possibility to recommend micturition at normal desire, without waiting for a strong desire in these patients with chronic bladder outlet obstruction, however further studies are required to confirm these results.

### De-obstruction of bladder outlet in humans reverses organ remodelling by normalizing the expression of key transcription factors [^04b7e315]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Benign prostatic hyperplasia can, independent of prostate size, cause bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) in elderly males termed benign prostatic obstruction (BPO). BPO is a dynamic chronic process accompanied by lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), including storage symptoms such as frequency, urgency and nocturia and voiding symptoms such as weak stream, delayed or intermittent voiding and incomplete emptying. Moderate to severe LUTS are found in approximately 25% of men aged 40 to 49 and in 50% aged 70 to 79. After exhausting less invasive medical treatment options, patients are offered surgical treatment, for example transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) to de-obstruct the bladder outlet. Although voiding parameters significantly improve, 20 to 40% of patients continue to experience at least some bothersome LUTS, inciting further research into the factors contributing to BPO-induced bladder dysfunction. Specifically, identifying the men at risk of irreparable bladder damage due to BPO and optimal timing of de-obstruction surgery are paramount to avoid loss of bladder function. Limited evidence from human studies and animal models, summarized in a recent report, supports the notion that BPO gradually progresses from inflammation to hypertrophy to fibrosis. BPO-induced bladder remodeling includes initial bladder hypertrophy during the compensated stage characterized by the increased detrusor contractility / pressure during voiding, and can be accompanied by detrusor overactivity (DO). This ultimately can lead to loss of bladder function (detrusor underactivity).

### De-obstruction of bladder outlet in humans reverses organ remodelling by normalizing the expression of key transcription factors [^9795aab3]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

In humans, the advancement of BPO-induced bladder remodelling is impossible to monitor, because several years can pass between the onset of symptoms and presentation in clinic. Nevertheless, it is possible to establish a correlation between the urodynamic phenotypes of BPO-induced lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) and the molecular alterations in the bladder, as we have recently shown in a comprehensive study of human bladder biopsies, obtained before TURP. The overall number of gene expression changes increased progressively: It was the lowest in BPO with detrusor overactivity and the highest in underactive decompensated bladders compared to controls without LUTD. Animal models of LUTD cannot replicate the chronic gradual longitudinal changes seen in human disease. To mimic human bladder outlet obstruction in rodents, the urethra is loosely ligated creating a partial bladder outlet obstruction (pBOO). In contrast to humans this causes acute obstruction resulting in a significant initial inflammatory impact immediately after surgery. There are other species-specific differences in immune processes, for example, the TNF-alpha-induced changes in human BPO are not observed in mouse pBOO, indicating a different pathophysiological mechanism of organ remodelling. Similarly, the acute partial obstruction induced in animals results in bladder stretch which is rarely encountered in humans and may affect the results generated by this model.

### Effect of bladder filling volume on detrusor contractility in men with bladder outlet obstruction [^45db8886]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2023). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

In case of bladder outlet obstruction in men, detrusor contractility depends on bladder filling volume, with reduced detrusor contractility when bladder is underfilled or overfilled. Moreover, contractility seems to progressively deteriorate with the evolution of lower urinary tract disorder, decreasing the detrusor capacity to respond to a high filling volume. This phenomenon could participate in the mechanisms of urinary retention in male patients with bladder outlet obstruction.

### De-obstruction of bladder outlet in humans reverses organ remodelling by normalizing the expression of key transcription factors [^2bc5bbf5]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

BPO induces significant remodelling in the human urinary bladder, which demonstrates a very similar reaction to increased outlet resistance as the heart subjected to pressure overload. Based on the observations made in animal models of pBOO, BOO is a chronic gradually progressive disease. Hypertrophy is the bladder’s initial response which most likely advances further until the final decompensatory stage, loss of contractility. On the molecular level, these processes are characterised by hypoxia and inflammatory response, which induce organ fibrosis. Indirect evidence collected in humans also points to the fact that BPO is a progressive disease, which can be delayed by pharmacological treatment with alpha-1 adrenergic antagonists and/or 5-alpha reductase inhibitors. In humans, monitoring urodynamic changes in the obstructed bladder after TURP allows the assessment of functional recovery, although drawing conclusions about the morphological alterations in the affected organ is difficult because a very limited number of studies offer relevant follow-up information. Increased bladder pressure and a reduced flow rate are the physiological parameters seen to be improved by therapeutic measures including surgical de-obstruction. Ultrasound measurements of the bladder or detrusor wall thickness, indicative of muscle hypertrophy, have been proposed to non-invasively monitor bladder remodelling during BPO, with significant differences observed between obstructed and non-obstructed patients. Bladder wall thickness was decreased one month after TURP surgery, indicating a recovery trend after de-obstruction. However, there were no symptomatic or urodynamic gains from de-obstruction in men with BPO and detrusor underactivity, implying that the timing of surgery is crucial for the outcome. Indeed, our previous study of the molecular changes in bladder dome biopsies from patients with different urodynamic phenotypes showed profound gene expression changes in BPO-induced detrusor underactivity leading to the loss of contractility.

### The effect of chronic bladder outlet obstruction on neuronal nitric oxide synthase expression in the intramural ganglia of the Guinea pig bladder [^98ae25c1]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

We examined the effect of chronic partial outlet obstruction on expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in the intramural ganglion cells of the guinea pig bladder.

Materials and Methods

Partial urethral ligation was done in young male guinea pigs. The animals were sacrificed 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 weeks after partial outlet obstruction and nNOS immunohistochemistry was done in the intramural neurons of the bladder. This was compared to controls (normal and sham operated). In addition, the mRNA expression of nNOS in bladders of 4-week sham operated and operated animals was also investigated using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.

Results

Two weeks after urethral obstruction a decrease in the number of nNOS positive intramural neurons was detected. This decrease was most drastic at 4 weeks. Cell counting showed a 60.6% decrease in the number of nNOS positive neurons compared to controls. Some neurons appeared to undergo degenerative changes, such as irregular outline, vacuolation and lysis. At 6 weeks the number of nNOS positive neurons increased from the nadir level at 4 weeks and the increase was sustained until 12 weeks, when the number of nNOS positive neurons was almost at the level of controls. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction also showed 42.4% down-regulation of nNOS expression 4 weeks after obstruction comparing with sham operation.

Conclusions

Partial urethral ligation resulted in an initial decrease in nNOS positive neurons, which have been due to actual neuronal loss and/or enzyme down-regulation. This may be attributable to regional hypoxia as a result of decreased blood flow consequent to high intravesical pressure created by partial ligation. The decrease in nNOS expression followed by a compensatory increase in nNOS positive neurons also suggests an attempt or mechanism to up-regulate nitric oxide bioactivity following increased bladder outlet resistance.

### Does this man with lower urinary tract symptoms have bladder outlet obstruction?: the rational clinical examination: a systematic review [^c15ed894]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on bladder outlet obstruction: 
- Definition: BOO is a condition characterized by an impediment to the flow of urine from the bladder to the urethra, leading to urinary retention and increased detrusor pressure.
- Pathophysiology: The pathophysiology of BOO is multifactorial and can be caused by a variety of conditions, involving anatomical, neurologic, and functional etiologies. Anatomical causes include BPH, urethral stricture, urethral diverticulum, urethral caruncle, urethral leiomyoma, uterine fibroids, pelvic organ prolapse, rectal cancer, bladder cancer, and bladder stones; neurologic causes include neurogenic bladder; and functional causes include dysfunctional voiding, primary bladder neck obstruction, and Fowler's syndrome.
- Epidemiology: The prevalence rates of LUTS due to BOO is estimated at 18.7-18.9% and 24.3-24.7% in women and men, respectively.
- Risk factors: Risk factors for BOO include age, with older individuals being more susceptible, and gender, with men being more prone due to conditions like BPH. Certain medical conditions like neurological disorders can also increase the risk of BOO. Additionally, iatrogenic causes such as post-surgical retentions (for example, after anti-urinary incontinence surgery) can also contribute to the development of BOO.
- Disease course: Clinically, BOO can present with a range of symptoms from mild urinary frequency and urgency to severe urinary retention. Other symptoms can include a weak or interrupted urine stream, straining to urinate, and a sensation of incomplete bladder emptying.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The prognosis of BOO largely depends on the underlying cause and the timeliness of treatment. If left untreated, BOO can lead to complications such as UTIs, bladder damage, and in severe cases, renal failure.

### Urethral orifice hyaluronic acid injections: a novel animal model of bladder outlet obstruction [^1133bd3e]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) is a common urological chronic condition in which the urine flow from the urinary bladder through the urethra is impeded. BOO can result from several diseases, including benign prostatic hyperplasia and urethral stricture in adults. To better understand the effect of this condition on bladder structure and function, several experimental animal models have been established. Those animal models that recreate BOO are critical to understanding the pathophysiology of many diseases related bladder function, and to evaluating the effects of various pharmacologic therapies.

The most widely used methodological approaches to creating BOO are the partial urethral obstruction (PUO) animal models. In these animal models, a ligature, cuff, or ring is surgically placed around the outlet of the catheterized bladder, so that when the catheter is removed, the bladder experiences increased urethral resistance [-]. Although animal models cannot perfectly recapitulate symptoms observed in clinic, evidence indicates that PUO rats have similar storage and micturition symptoms as human BOO patients [-].

However, massive trauma caused by open surgery causes some complications such as incision infection and bladder stone formation. It is also difficult to standardize the firmness of ligation, or exclude foreign material from rings in surgery PUO models. Therefore, establishing a relevant, reproducible, and minimally invasive BOO animal model would be useful.

Bulking agents have previously been injected to treat urinary incontinence in clinic. The injection seeks to increase bladder outlet resistance by oppressing the urethra and thereby reducing urinary leakage in patients with stress urinary incontinence. The establishment of a BOO animal model is possible by a similar principle. Hyaluronic acid is a viscous mucopolysaccharide found in the connective tissue space. It is ideal for BOO model establishment because it is stable and histocompatible. We aimed to establish a novel BOO animal model by hyaluronic acid periurethral injection, and to compare the effects and related complications of this technique with traditional PUO surgery.

### The effect of chronic partial bladder outlet obstruction on corpus cavernosum smooth muscle and rho-kinase in rabbits [^29ae889e]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2008). Low credibility.

Aim

The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of different severities in bladder dysfunction on corpus cavernosum physiology, morphology and expression of Rho-kinase in rabbits.

Methods

Male New Zealand rabbits were divided into control, 2 and 8 weeks of partial bladder outlet obstruction (PBOO) groups. Isolated cavernosal strips from all groups were precontracted with phenylephrine and the relaxant responses to electrical field stimulation (EFS), ATP, acetylcholine, and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were determined. Histological and molecular studies were performed.

Results

Corpus cavernosum smooth muscle (CCSM) from 8 weeks obstruction rabbits showed significant decreases in the contractile response to phenylephrine and further decreased relaxation responses to EFS in comparison to 2 weeks group. Relaxation induced by ATP, acetylcholine, and SNP were all significantly diminished at both 2 and 8 weeks obstruction equally. The ratio of smooth muscle to collagen decreased at 2 weeks and further dropped at 8 weeks obstruction. Expression of both isoforms of Rho-kinase were increased in both obstruction groups at 2 weeks obstruction and decreased significantly (from the 2 week obstructed values) at 8 weeks while remaining above control values.

Conclusion

The present study indicated that severe bladder dysfunction secondary to chronic PBOO induced significant physiological dysfunctions of CCSM as well as morphological changes. Activities of both ROK isoenzymes showed increases at 2- and 8-week obstructions. Increase in Rho-kinase expression/activity would be expected to make the CCSM more difficult to relax and also contribute to reduction of EFS-induced relaxation of CCSM after chronic PBOO.

### Do functional changes occur in the bladder due to bladder outlet obstruction?-ICI-RS 2018 [^1519584a]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2019). Medium credibility.

3 HOW DO HISTOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL CHANGES IN THE BLADDER CORRELATE WITH (CHANGING) URODYNAMIC FINDINGS?

Increased bladder pressure is the only urodynamic parameter that can be improved clinically. Although multiple treatment options exist for LUTS/BPO, mainly surgery, and to some extent α‐1 adrenergic antagonists and 5‐α reductase inhibitors, have been reported to improve BOO. 22, 23 The model of structural bladder remodeling with longstanding BOO explains failures of surgical and medical therapies when applied too late in its natural history. Currently, only a few clinical markers of structural bladder remodeling are available, including increased estimated bladder or detrusor weight and endoscopic evidence of trabeculation. Consequently, molecular mechanisms of bladder remodeling in BOO remain unclear. Further issues deserving investigations are timing and reversibility of BOO‐induced bladder remodeling.

Studies on human tissues indicate that BOO induces molecular and morphological‐structural alterations in multiple bladder compartments, namely urothelium, suburothelium, detrusor SMCs, detrusor ECM, and neurons. Cyclic stretch increased pressure, and hypoxia has been shown to modulate multiple signaling pathways involved in these alterations. The initial inflammatory response and ischemia are followed by progression to smooth muscle hypertrophy. 3 Combined with an increase of collagen content in the bladder wall 13, 15 this results in increased bladder wall thickness (BWT). 20 Apart from BOO, there is evidence that BWT or DWT is linked to urodynamic changes. DWT might, therefore, be a proxy for detrusor contractility. Rademakers et al 24 reported that a combination of low DWT and large bladder capacity accurately defines the presence of detrusor underactivity. De Nunzio et al 25 observed a correlation between increased DWT and detrusor overactivity. A summary of findings from these studies 24, 25 that correlate detrusor or bladder wall thickness (DWT/BWT) with detrusor dysfunction is presented in Table 1 A and 1 B.

### Partial outlet obstruction of the rabbit urinary bladder induces selective protein oxidation [^b9b4f0d4]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2008). Low credibility.

Aims

Oxidation of proteins is presumed to contribute to contractile dysfunction associated with partial outlet obstruction (PBOO) of the urinary bladder. The objective of this study was to determine the acute and chronic effects of PBOO on protein oxidation in urinary bladder detrusor smooth muscle (DSM) and mucosa, and to correlate these findings with in vitro contractile function.

Methods

Urinary bladders of New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits were obstructed for 1, 3, 7 and 14 days. Proteins were extracted from the bladder tissues and protein carbonyl formation was assessed using immunoblot assays. In vitro contractile response to field stimulation (32 Hz) and carbachol was evaluated in whole bladder strips at the same time points.

Results

Significant elevations in oxidation of DSM proteins were observed in the MW range of 29-65 kDa after 3 days and 14 days of obstruction. No changes in the oxidative status of mucosal proteins were detected as a result of short or long term obstruction. The intermediate filament protein, desmin (53-55 kDa) was detected in obstructed DSM samples in the same MW range as oxidized proteins. A significant decrease in contractile response to field stimulation and carbachol was observed after 1 day and 3-days respectively, and continued to deteriorate through 14 days.

Conclusion

The increase in protein oxidation at 14-days of obstruction correlates with impaired bladder contractility, suggesting that oxidatively modified proteins may contribute to the contractile and biochemical dysfunction associated with PBOO.

### Progressive bladder remodeling due to bladder outlet obstruction: a systematic review of morphological and molecular evidences in humans [^d0d020d9]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Bladder outlet obstruction (BOO), clinically defined as high-pressure/low-flow micturition pattern at urodynamic investigations, is a common urological condition in humans with benign prostatic obstruction (BPO) being the most frequent causative factor. It represents a key pathophysiological link between benign prostate enlargement (BPE) and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Besides symptoms, BOO can also lead to progressive tissue remodeling of the bladder and of the upper urinary tract with subsequent serious functional impairments. Based on the results from studies on animal models exposed to experimental partial outlet obstruction, the remodeling of the bladder involves the modulation of several signaling pathways as well as histological alterations occurring in almost all cellular compartments. These changes are described to progress through three sequential stages: hypertrophy, compensation and decompensation. In the hypertrophy stage, mechanical stress activates early signals that mediate bladder wall hypertrophy. At the same time, due to the occurrence of focal area of hypoxia, angiogenesis is stimulated thus enabling blood flow to increase relative to bladder mass. In the compensated stage bladder growth and angiogenesis stop. At some point, if obstruction persists, the bladder shifts to a decompensated state as a result of cyclical ischemia-reperfusion injury occurring during the micturition phase that leads to the activation of pathways involved in the progressive loss of smooth muscle, deposition of extracellular matrix and neuronal loss. The duration of these stages varies considerably according to the experimental models and is unpredictably. Data about the reversibility of these alterations are also lacking. H uman detrusor differs significantly from animal models and most of the species used for research don’t suffer from naturally occurring outflow obstruction. The aim of the present study was to summarize available evidences about BOO-induced morphological and molecular alterations occurring in the various compartments of human bladder.

### Fetal bladder outlet obstruction: embryopathology, in utero intervention and outcome [^b3ce8532]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Fetal bladder outlet obstruction (BOO), most commonly caused by posterior urethral valves (PUV), remains a challenging and multi-faceted condition. Evolving techniques, and refinement in ultrasound, optics and instrumentation, have increased our rate of prenatal diagnosis, and enabled valve ablation not only in smaller newborns, but also in fetuses. Long-term outcome studies have raised our awareness of the silent damage caused by bladder dysfunction and polyuria and encouraged their proactive management. In spite of our best efforts, the proportion of boys with PUV who progress to chronic and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has not changed in the last 25 years. Evidence suggests a reduction in perinatal mortality following prenatal intervention, probably resulting from amelioration of oligohydramnios at the crucial time of lung development between 16 and 28 weeks' gestation, but no improvement in postnatal renal outcome. There are no bladder functional outcome studies in patients who have undergone prenatal intervention and hence the long-term effect of in utero defunctionalisation of the bladder is not known. This aim of this review is to revisit the embryopathology of fetal BOO, in particular the renal and bladder structural and functional changes that occur with in utero obstruction. The effect of earlier prenatal diagnosis, and therapy, on postnatal outcome is also explored and compared with outcomes published for traditional postnatal treatment.

### Gastric outlet and duodenal obstruction from inflammatory pancreatic disease (...) [^ecf6e62c]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

• During a ten-year period, 16 patients with gastric outlet and duodenal obstruction due to inflammatory pancreatic disease were seen. The cause of obstruction was chronic pancreatitis in ten patients, pseudocysts with associated pancreatitis in five patients, and pancreatic abscess in one patient. All patients had nausea and vomiting, 14 had abdominal pain, and five had weight loss greater than 4. 5 kg. Diagnosis was made by plain abdominal film in one case, upper gastrointestinal tract roentgenographic series in 15 cases, and endoscopy in 11 cases. Mobilization of the duodenum relieved the obstruction in two patients. Fixed obstruction remained in 14 patients. This was relieved by gastrojejunostomy in 12 patients. Gastrojejunostomy was combined with drainage of a pseudocyst in three patients, a dilated pancreatic duct in three patients, and a dilated common bile duct in four patients. Obstruction was relieved by pseudocyst drainage in two patients.

### Nonneurogenic female bladder outlet obstruction: conservative and medical management [^01111fd6]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

In nonneurogenic female bladder outlet obstruction (BOO), management goals include reduction of outlet resistance to increase urinary outflow and improve bladder voiding to prevent or reduce lower and upper urinary tract (LUT and UUT) function deterioration. It also aims to reduce the patient's symptoms and to achieve a descent quality of life (QoL). After proper identification of BOO subtype (anatomical vs. functional) and/or diagnosis, treatment choices will differ accordingly. The aim of management is correction of the underlying etiology.Since significant progress has recently been achieved in the field of female BOO,the purpose of this article is to review and summarize the current literature.

### Antimuscarinics and bladder outlet obstruction: from a contraindication to an indication? [^dd60c5bd]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2010). Low credibility.

Aim

To review if the existing data support the new concept that antimuscarinic agents can be used for the treatment of bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) with coexisting overactive bladder (OAB).

Method

A literature search of Medline publications (up to 2008) on use of antimuscarinic agents for treatment BOO was performed and all data were presented. All relevant data from published studies in congress abstracts were as well included.

Results

The existing data show that this treatment effectively improves patient quality of life. Concerns about the possibility of urinary retention were shown to be unfounded. It seems that antimuscarinic agents do not affect voiding pressures and the use of antimuscarinic agents for BOO seems safe.

Conclusions

The combination of an alpha-blocker and antimuscarinic agent for the treatment of BOO with concomitant OAB seems promising.

### Effect of bladder filling volume on detrusor contractility in men with bladder outlet obstruction [^444f7091]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Affecting more than 20% of the population, lower urinary tract disorders are frequent. Among these, voiding dysfunction and urinary retention still raise pathophysiological, etiopathogenic and therapeutic questions. These voiding disorders can be related to a bladder outlet obstruction, most frequently benign prostatic hyperplasia in men, and/or an impaired detrusor contractility. Bladder outlet obstruction may itself lead to a progressive detrusor contractility alteration, decreasing the ability of the detrusor to respond to high bladder filling with thus a risk of urinary retention.A better understanding of the factors related to detrusor contractility is therefore essential for the diagnostic and therapeutic management of voiding disorders.

The detrusor contraction efficiency depends on many factors, including the smooth muscle fibers degree of elongation, and therefore on the bladder filling volume. This influence of bladder filling volume on detrusor contractility in healthy subjects was confirmed non‐invasively by Van Mastrigt and Huang Foen Chung in 2006 on 1020 volunteers.In addition to the filling volume, detrusor contractility could be influenced by other factors such as detrusor structural changes, bladder wall vascular alterations, bladder outlet obstruction severity, sensory afferent alterations, and time from the onset of the symptoms.

The relationship between detrusor contractility and bladder filling volume, found in healthy subjects, is not yet known in case of lower urinary tract disorders. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of bladder filling volume on detrusor contractility in case of bladder outlet obstruction in men. The secondary objectives were first to evaluate the impact of the desire to void on detrusor contractility, second to investigate the factors that can impact detrusor contractility in men with bladder outlet obstruction, and third, to verify the correlation between detrusor contractility measured by the stop‐test technique and the other pressure‐flow studies parameters.

### Functional consequences of chronic bladder ischemia [^12a51f3c]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2014). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), particularly in the elderly, seems to be multifactorial. One of the factors involved may be chronic ischemia of the bladder caused by bladder outflow obstruction (male) or atherosclerosis (male/female). The mechanisms by which chronic ischemia initiates and causes LUTS and progressive bladder dysfunction, and the time course of the effects, are incompletely known. Bladder ischemia and repeated ischemia/reperfusion during a micturition cycle may produce oxidative stress, leading to denervation of the bladder and the expression of tissue damaging molecules in the bladder wall. This may be responsible for the development of detrusor overactivity progressing to detrusor underactivity and inability to empty the bladder. The extent of bladder dysfunction in chronic bladder ischemia may depend on the degree and duration of ischemia. To prevent chronic bladder ischemia caused by atherosclerosis and to treat its consequences, more pathophysiological knowledge is needed. Several animal models of atherosclerosis-induced chronic bladder ischemia are available and should be useful tools for further research.

### Effect of bladder filling volume on detrusor contractility in men with bladder outlet obstruction [^8124290c]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Introduction

Bladder outlet obstruction alters detrusor contractility, reducing the bladder ' s ability to respond to large filling with a risk of urinary retention.

The objective was to assess the effect of bladder filling volume on detrusor contractility in men with bladder outlet obstruction.

Methods

A prospective multicenter study in two pelviperineology departments. Male patients eligible for urodynamics (IPSS score > 7) were included from January to July 2022. In case of absence of bladder outlet obstruction on pressure‐flow studies, they were secondarily excluded. The primary endpoint was the maximum isometric detrusor pressure during a stop‐test, corresponding to detrusor contractility, measured at 3 filling volumes (50%, 75%, and 100% of cystometric capacity).

Results

Fifty‐two patients performed urodynamics, of whom 12 were excluded because of lack of obstruction or inability to perform the stop‐test. Detrusor contractility was significantly higher for a 75% bladder filling than 50% and for a 75% filling than 100%, with a mean difference of 19.5; confidence interval (CI) 95% [14.3; 24.8] and 12.2; CI 95% [6.9; 17.5] cmH 2 O respectively (p < 0,01).

Conclusion

In case of bladder outlet obstruction in men, detrusor contractility depends on bladder filling volume, with reduced contractility when the bladder was underfilled or overfilled. This phenomenon could help to explain the mechanisms of urinary retention in men with bladder outlet obstruction.

### Is there evidence for pelvic floor muscle relaxation training in nonneurogenic female bladder outlet obstruction? – A narrative review [^3da77ac6]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Functional bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) in women is postulated to be caused by pelvic floor muscle (PFM) dyssynergia or increased tone. The aim of the present review was to investigate the effect of PFM relaxation training on PFM tone and female BOO symptoms.

Materials and Methods

This was a narrative review using an open search strategy on PubMed with the search terms "Bladder outlet obstruction" AND "female" AND ("pelvic floor muscles" OR "Kegel"). The risk of bias of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was scored with the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale (0-10).

Results

Only three RCTs were found. All three RCTs compared different types of exercise, and no trial compared relaxation training with no or sham treatment. None of the trials reported the effect between groups on the reduction of PFM tone. There was a tendency toward positive effect of PFM relaxation training to improve BOO symptoms in women. PEDro score varied between 4 and 7. Few studies yielded information on the immediate effect of any type of PFM relaxation technique on PFM tone.

Conclusion

Few RCTs have been conducted on the effect of PFM relaxation training on PFM tone and functional female BOO symptoms. There is an urgent need for RCTs with high methodological and interventional quality in addition to basic research on mechanisms of different relaxation techniques on PFM activity.

### Effect of bladder filling volume on detrusor contractility in men with bladder outlet obstruction [^3fc2ad79]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2023). Medium credibility.

2.5 Statistical analysis

Demographic data were described by the number of patients analyzed and associated percentages, or by means and their standard deviations.

For the primary objective, the measures of detrusor contractility at each stop test were compared in pairs by a random‐effect linear regression model: contractility at 50% filling versus contractility at 75% and contractility at 75% versus contractility at 100%. Because of the risk of alpha risk inflation, the significance level was set at 2.5%. The number of participants required was calculated at 40.

For the secondary objectives, different cofactors were included in the random‐effect linear regression model to assess their effect on contractility regardless of filling volume. The postvoid residual (PVR) was also included in the regression model to assess the influence of contractility on PVR. To assess the correlation between the stop‐test measure of contractility and the pressure‐flow study parameters (bladder contractility index [BCI], bladder outlet obstruction index [BOOI], detrusor pressure at maximum flow [PdetQmax]), a Spearman's correlation test was performed. Finally, the impact of the desire to void on contractility was assessed by a second random‐effect linear regression model. For secondary objectives, the alpha risk was set at 5%.

The statistical software R freeware (version 3.6.3; The R Foundation) was used for the statistical analyses.

### Does this man with lower urinary tract symptoms have bladder outlet obstruction?: the rational clinical examination: a systematic review [^d3a205fd]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Early, accurate diagnosis of bladder outlet obstruction in men with lower urinary tract symptoms may reduce the need for invasive testing (ie, catheter placement, urodynamics), and prompt early treatment to provide symptomatic relief and avoid complications.

Objectives

To systematically review the evidence on (1) the diagnostic accuracy of office-based tests for bladder outlet obstruction in men with lower urinary tract symptoms; and (2) the accuracy of the bladder scan as a measure of urine volume because management decisions rely on measuring postvoid bladder residual volumes.

Data Sources and Study Selection

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1950-March 2014), along with reference lists from retrieved articles were searched to identify studies of diagnostic test accuracy among males with lower urinary tract symptoms due to bladder outlet obstruction. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library (1950-March 2014) were searched to identify studies of urine volumes measured with a bladder scanner vs those measured with bladder catheterization. Prospective studies were selected if they compared 1 or more office-based, noninvasive diagnostic test with the reference test or were invasive urodynamic studies, and if urine volumes were measured with a bladder scanner and bladder catheterization.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

For the bladder outlet obstruction objective, 8628 unique citations were identified. Ten studies (1262 patients among 9 unique cohorts) met inclusion criteria. For the bladder scan objective, 2254 unique citations were identified. Twenty studies (n=1397 patients) met inclusion criteria.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The first main outcome and measure was the diagnostic accuracy of individual symptoms and questionnaires compared with the reference standard (urodynamic studies) for the diagnosis of bladder outlet obstruction in males with lower urinary tract symptoms. The second was the correlation between urine volumes measured with a bladder scanner and those measured with bladder catheterization.

Results

Among males with lower urinary tract symptoms, the likelihood ratios (LRs) of individual symptoms and questionnaires for diagnosing bladder outlet obstruction from the highest quality studies had 95% CIs that included 1.0, suggesting they are not significantly associated with one another. An International Prostate Symptom Score cutoff of 20 or greater increased the likelihood of bladder outlet obstruction (positive LR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.0), whereas scores of less than 20 had an LR that included 1.0 in the 95% CI (negative LR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.67-1.00). We found no data on the accuracy of physical examination findings to predict bladder outlet obstruction. Urine volumes measured by a bladder scanner correlated highly with urine volumes measured by bladder catheterization (summary correlation coefficient, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.91-0.95).

Conclusions and Relevance

In patients with lower urinary tract symptoms, the symptoms alone are not enough to adequately diagnose bladder outlet obstruction. A bladder scan for urine volume should be performed to assess patients with suspected large postvoid residual volumes.

### Influence of sildenafil on blood oxygen saturation of the obstructed bladder [^441da58a]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

There is growing evidence that ischemia of the bladder wall contributes to the initiation of bladder dysfunction. Several studies have shown effects in obstructed bladder that can be interpreted as long term results of hypoxia. Furthermore, there is an increasing interest in the nitric oxide (NO) pathway as a potential pharmacological target to treat lower urinary tract symptoms.

Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) is involved in the NO pathway and it has been immunolocalized both in the detrusor muscle cells and in the vascular endothelium. PDE5 inhibitors were found to improve several functional aspects of bladder dysfunction in human and animal studies [-]. The mechanisms behind this have not been fully elucidated yet, but it can be assumed that PDE5 inhibitors influence detrusor muscle cell action directly but also indirectly through enhancement of tissue microcirculation of the bladder tissue. In a previous study we have shown in a Guinea pig model of bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) that the oxygen saturation is significantly lower in the obstructed bladder compared to sham operated bladder, both during the voiding and filling phase.

The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of the PDE5 inhibitor Sildenafil citrate (SC), which enhances tissue microcirculation, on bladder function and blood oxygen saturation (BOS) in vivo in an animal model of bladder outlet obstruction.

### Inhibition of HIF reduces bladder hypertrophy and improves bladder function in murine model of partial bladder outlet obstruction [^a1b8ae00]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Posterior urethral valves are the most common cause of partial bladder outlet obstruction in the pediatric population. However, to our knowledge the etiology and the detailed mechanisms underlying pathological changes in the bladder following partial bladder outlet obstruction remain to be elucidated. Recent findings suggest that hypoxia and associated up-regulation of HIFs (hypoxia-inducible factors) have a key role in partial bladder outlet obstruction induced pathology in the bladder. We examined the effects of pharmacological inhibition of HIF pathways by 17-DMAG (17-(dimethylaminoethylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin) in pathophysiological phenotypes after partial bladder outlet obstruction.

Materials and Methods

Partial bladder outlet obstruction was surgically created in male C57BL/6J mice. The animals received oral administration of 17-DMAG or vehicle daily starting from the initiation of obstruction up to 5 days. Sham operated mice served as controls. Bladders were harvested from each group 2, 4 and 7 days postoperatively, and analyzed for histological and biochemical changes. Bladder function was assessed by in vitro muscle contractility recordings.

Results

Partial bladder outlet obstruction caused a significant increase in the bladder mass accompanying enhanced collagen deposition in the bladder wall while 17-DMAG treatment suppressed those increases. Treatment with 17-DMAG attenuated the degree of up-regulation of HIFs and their target genes involving the development of tissue fibrosis in obstructed bladders. Treatment with 17-DMAG improved the decreased responses of obstructed bladder strips to electrical field stimulation and KCl.

Conclusions

In vivo 17-DMAG treatment decreased partial bladder outlet obstruction induced pathophysiological changes in the bladder. HIF pathway inhibition has a potential clinical implication for the development of novel pharmacological therapies to treat bladder pathology associated with partial bladder outlet obstruction.

### Terazosin (Tezruly) [^1ee54a43]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia

The symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) are related to bladder outlet obstruction, which is comprised of two underlying components: static and dynamic. The static component is related to an increase in prostate size caused, in part by a proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the prostatic stroma. However, the severity of BPH symptoms and the degree of urethral obstruction do not correlate well with the size of the prostate. The dynamic component is a function of an increase in smooth muscle tone in the prostate and bladder neck. The degree of tone in this area is mediated by the alpha-1-adrenoceptors, which is reent in high density in the prostate stroma, prostatic capsule, prostatic urethra, and bladder neck. Blockade of the alpha-1 receptor decreases urethral resistance and may relieve the obstruction of BPH symptoms and improve urine flow

Hypertension

The mechanism of action of terazosin is selective blockade of the alpha-1 subtype of adrenergic receptors. The antihypertensive effect of terazosin results from a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. In animals, terazosin causes a decrease in blood pressure by decreasing total peripheral vascular resistance. The vasodilatory hypotensive action of terazosin appears to be produced mainly by antagonism of alpha-1 adrenoceptors. Terazosin decreases blood pressure within 15 minutes following oral administration.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)

Administration of terazosin 10 mg to patients with BPH resulted in significant improvement in both symptoms and peak urinary flow rate compared to placebo [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] .

Terazosin administration to normotensive men with BPH did not result in a clinically significant blood pressure lowering effect [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] .

Hypertension

Terazosin’s antihypertensive effects usually persist throughout the dosing interval (usually 24 hours), with the supine systolic and diastolic responses 5 to 10 mmHg and 3.5 to 8 mmHg greater, respectively than placebo.

Limited data show that the peak blood pressure response measured 2 to 3 hours post-dose is greater than about twice the trough (24 hour) response during chronic administration [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] .

### Surgical management of functional bladder outlet obstruction in adults with neurogenic bladder dysfunction [^2eb879fd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The most common type of functional bladder outlet obstruction in patients with neurogenic bladder is detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia (DSD). The lack of co-ordination between the bladder and the external urethral sphincter muscle (EUS) in DSD can result in poor bladder emptying and high bladder pressures, which may eventually lead to progressive renal damage.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of different surgical therapies for the treatment of functional bladder outlet obstruction (i.e. DSD) in adults with neurogenic bladder dysfunction.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 20 February 2014), and the reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing a surgical treatment of DSD in adults suffering from neurogenic bladder dysfunction, with no treatment, placebo, non-surgical treatment, or other surgical treatment, alone or in combination.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

We included five trials (total of 199 participants, average age of 40 years). The neurological diseases causing DSD were traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI), multiple sclerosis (MS), or congenital malformations.One trial compared placement of sphincteric stent prosthesis with sphincterotomy. For urodynamic measurements, results for postvoid residual urine volume (PVR) and cystometric bladder capacity were inconclusive and consistent with benefit of either sphincteric stent prosthesis or sphincterotomy at three, six, 12, and 24 months. Results for maximum detrusor pressure (Pdet.max) were also inconclusive at three, six, and 12 months; however, after two years, the Pdet.max after sphincterotomy was lower than after stent placement (mean difference (MD) -30 cmH2O, 95% confidence interval (CI) 8.99 to 51.01).Four trials considered botulinum A toxin (BTX-A) injection in the EUS, either alone or in combination with other treatments. The comparators included oral baclofen, oral alpha blocker, lidocaine, and placebo. The BTX-A trials all differed in protocols, and therefore we did not undertake meta-analysis. A single 100 units transperineal BTX-A injection (Botox®) in patients with MS resulted in higher voided urine volumes (MD 69 mL, 95% CI 11.87 to 126.13), lower pre-micturition detrusor pressure (MD -10 cmH2O, 95% CI -17.62 to -2.38), and lower Pdet.max (MD -14 cmH2O, 95% CI -25.32 to -2.68) after 30 days, compared to placebo injection. Results for PVR using catheterisation, basal detrusor pressure, maximal bladder capacity, maximal urinary flow, bladder compliance at functional bladder capacity, maximal urethral pressure, and closure urethral pressure at 30 days were inconclusive and consistent with benefit of either BTX-A injection or placebo injections. In participants with SCI, treatment with 200 units of Chinese manufactured BTX-A injected at eight different sites resulted in better bladder compliance (MD 7.5 mL/cmH2O, 95% CI -10.74 to -4.26) than participants who received the same injections with the addition of oral baclofen. Results for maximum uroflow rate, maximal cystometric capacity, and volume per voiding were inconclusive and consistent with benefit of either BTX-A injection or BTX-A injection with the addition of oral baclofen. However, the poor quality of reporting in this trial caused us to question the relevance of bladder compliance as an adequate outcome measure.In participants with DSD due to traumatic SCI, MS, or congenital malformation, the results for PVRs after one day were inconclusive and consistent with benefit of either a single 100 units transperineal BTX-A (Botox®) injection or lidocaine injection. However, after seven and 30 days of BTX-A injection, PVRs were lower (MD -163 and -158 mL, 95% CI -308.65 to -17.35 and 95% CI -277.57 to -39.03, respectively) compared to participants who received lidocaine injections. Results at one month for Pdet.max on voiding, EUS activity in electromyography, and maximal urethral pressure were inconclusive and consistent with benefit of either BTX-A or lidocaine injections.Finally, one small trial consisting of five men with SCI compared weekly BTX-A injections with normal saline as placebo. The placebo had no effect on DSD in the two participants allocated to the placebo treatment. Their urodynamic parameters were unchanged from baseline values until subsequent injections with BTX-A once a week for three weeks. These subsequent injections resulted in similar responses to those of the three participants who were allocated to the BTX-A treatment. Unfortunately, the report presented no data on placebo treatment.Only the trial that compared sphincterotomy with stent placement reported outcome measures renal function and urologic complications related to DSD. Results for renal function at 12 and 24 months, and urologic complications related to DSD at three, six, 12, and 24 months were inconclusive and consistent with benefit of either sphincteric stent prosthesis or sphincterotomy.Adverse effects reported were haematuria due to the cystoscopic injection and muscle weakness, of which the latter may be related to the BTX-A dose used.All trials had some methodological shortcomings, so insufficient information was available to permit judgement of risk of bias. At least half of the trials had an unclear risk of selection bias and reporting bias. One trial had a high risk of attrition bias, and another trial had a high risk of reporting bias.

Authors' Conclusions

Results from small studies with a high risk of bias have identified evidence of limited quality that intraurethral BTX-A injections improve some urodynamic measures after 30 days in the treatment of functional bladder outlet obstruction in adults with neurogenic bladder dysfunction. The necessity of reinjection of BTX-A is a significant drawback; a sphincterotomy might therefore be a more effective treatment option for lowering bladder pressure in the long-term.However, because of the limited availability of eligible trials, this review was unable to provide robust evidence in favour of any of the surgical treatment options. More RCTs are needed, measuring improvement on quality of life, and on other types of surgical treatment options for DSD since these are lacking. Future RCTs assessing the effectiveness of BTX-A injections also need to address the uncertainty about the optimal dose and mode of injection for this specific type of urological condition.

### Bladder outlet procedures in the setting of anticoagulation therapy [^ce6caffc]. Current Opinion in Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To assess the safety and bleeding risk in men on chronic oral anticoagulation, including antiplatelet therapies, undergoing bladder outlet procedures for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

Recent Findings

There are conflicting findings; however, most recent series show that when treating bladder outlet obstruction from BPH in patients on chronic anticoagulants, there is an increased risk of hemorrhagic complications for these men. There is also an increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications, especially when antithrombotic therapy is used for secondary prevention and is withdrawn perioperatively. Some have found bipolar electrosurgical vaporization of the prostate, laser vaporization, and enucleation of the prostate to provide superior hemostatic outcomes compared to classic monopolar transurethral resection of the prostate.

Summary

Extra caution should always be given to patients on chronic anticoagulation undergoing surgical procedures, given increased risk of bleeding and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications. For men with BPH undergoing bladder outlet procedures, photoselective vaporization of the prostate, Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate, and vaporization of the prostate with bipolar electrosurgical instruments may result in less bleeding complications. Further prospective randomized studies are needed to elucidate which methods provide better hemostasis and lower postoperative bleeding to best manage men with BPH on chronic antithrombotic therapy, especially when the anticoagulation therapy cannot be discontinued prior to therapy.

### Is It possible to regenerate the underactive detrusor? Part 2. electrical stimulation therapies, treatment of bladder outlet obstruction, constipation, and pelvic floor disorders-ICI-RS 2024 [^bdc70d3e]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Detrusor muscle weakness is commonly noted on urodynamics in patients with refractory voiding difficulty. No clinical therapy has been proven to augment the strength of a detrusor contraction.

Methods

This subject was discussed at a think-tank at the International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society (ICI-RS) held in Bristol, June 2024. The discussions of the think-tank are being published in two parts. This second part discusses the role of electrical stimulation therapies, treatment of bladder outlet obstruction, constipation, and pelvic floor disorders, in the enhancement of strength of a detrusor contraction.

Results

Electrical stimulation therapies, specifically sacral neuromodulation, have long been used in the salvage of patients with refractory nonobstructive voiding dysfunction. Clinical improvements can be noted in men following bladder outlet resistance reduction surgery especially, though not limited to those with demonstrable obstruction. Some patients may also show improvement with pelvic floor relaxation therapies and constipation care. However, there is a lack of high-quality urodynamic data to demonstrate an improvement in the strength of a detrusor contraction with these therapies. The think-tank recommends standards for future clinical studies examining treatments aimed at improving an underactive detrusor.

Conclusions

Studies need to examine whether clinical improvement following treatment of patients with an underactive detrusor is associated with improvement in strength of the detrusor contraction. New therapeutic options should apply specified standards for assessing and reporting the impact on detrusor contraction.

### Potential for recovery in bladder function after removing a urethral obstruction [^77142491]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2008). Low credibility.

Aims

We examined the relation between the loss of bladder function during obstruction and the potential for recovery of function after de-obstruction.

Methods

Guinea pigs received a partial urethral obstruction. Bladder pressure, urine flow rate, detrusor overactivity (DO), compliance and contractility were examined weekly for 2-4 weeks (short), 6-8 weeks (medium), or 9-12 weeks (long). Then the obstruction was removed and bladder function followed up to 7 weeks. The groups were compared to animals receiving only obstruction or a sham operation.

Results

During obstruction the three de-obstruction groups and the obstruction group progressively lost bladder function. Flow rate remained stable, compliance decreased, pressure, contractility and DO increased. After de-obstruction the response in the three de-obstruction groups varied. In S, bladder pressure and compliance normalized, contractility initially increased then decreased towards high normal values, DO remained high normal and flow rate increased. In M, bladder pressure and DO decreased to above average normal levels. Compliance improved but did not normalize. Contractility initially stabilized, then decreased to just above the normal range. Flow-rate increased. In L, bladder pressure and DO decreased to high normal. Compliance did not improve. Contractility decreased directly after de-obstruction, stabilizing at an above normal level, flow-rate increased.

Conclusions

The potential for functional recovery decreases with increasing loss of bladder function. At all stages of bladder dysfunction, voiding pressure appears to normalize after de-obstruction. However, contractility remains high and compliance low. Such a bladder may be more vulnerable to new events of outflow obstruction than a low contractile, normal compliant bladder.

### Angiotensin II increases corpus cavernosal contractility and oxidative stress in partial bladder outlet obstructed rabbits: relevance to erectile dysfunction [^c58b9742]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

We investigated the effect angiotensin II (Ang II), a corpus cavernosal smooth muscle (CCSM) constrictor peptide, has on tissue taken from rabbits following chronic partial bladder outlet obstruction (PBOO), as this model is characterized by an increase in corpus cavernosal collagen deposition and a marked reduction and impaired relaxation of CCSM cells.

Aim

To determine the interaction between Ang II and nitric oxide (NO) and the development of oxidative stress (OS) in a rabbit model of chronic PBOO.

Methods

Corpus cavernosal tissue was obtained from 12 sham-operated and 20 PBOO rabbits. Organ bath studies determined Ang II/NO interaction on CCSM function using losartan (AT1 receptor antagonist), sodium nitroprusside (SNP, NO donor), electrical field stimulation (EFS), and vardenafil (phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor). The role of OS in the Ang II response was also determined using diphenylene iodonium chloride (DPI), the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase inhibitor, which inhibits superoxide production and superoxide dismutase (SOD, the enzyme that accelerates the breakdown of superoxide).

Main Outcome Measure

Action of Ang II and AT1 receptor antagonist, as well as SOD and DPI on CCSM function.

Results

Ang II caused a dose-dependent contraction of CCSM strips that was enhanced in PBOO rabbits and inhibited by losartan, DPI, and SOD. CCSM relaxation induced by SNP/EFS was impaired in this model and improved by vardenafil and losartan.

Conclusions

These findings imply that the increased Ang II contractile response is a pathological consequence of PBOO and that AT1 receptor inhibition may be a therapeutic approach to treat ED associated with PBOO.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^05bf7029]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)—role of post-void residual (PVR) in surgical decision-making: An elevated PVR should not be used as the only indication for bladder outlet surgery, and patients with non-neurogenic chronic urinary retention should be evaluated for safety issues (renal insufficiency, chronic UTI) and for symptoms impacting urinary quality of life; safety and QoL issues can be treated with bladder drainage such as intermittent catheterization while the patient is being evaluated for bladder outlet obstruction (BOO).

### Meta-analysis with individual data of functional outcomes following aquablation for lower urinary tract symptoms due to BPH in various prostate anatomies [^d47643b4]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2021). High credibility.

Second, there were statistically significant and clinically important improvements in all key parameters (IPSS, IPSS QOL, Qmax and PVR) across subgroups of prostate size (<100 vs ≥100 and obstructive median lobe present or absent). These findings suggest that more complex anatomy (larger prostates with median lobes) can be more than adequately treated with Aquablation. For other technologies, these prostate subgroups are challenging, such as prostatic urethral lift and convective water vapour ablation, which are contraindicated in prostates over 100 mL and 80 mL, respectively. TURP and PVP are typically performed in prostates less than 80 mL due to the amount of time needed to properly address the amount of tissue.Enucleation and simple prostatectomy are applicable for large prostates but have their limitations. In further analysis, improvements in these parameters were similar among men with both large prostate volume (≥100 mL) and a median lobe.

There were statistically significant and clinically important improvement across all IPSS individual questions and in men with both simple and complex prostate anatomy. Several studies have shown improvements in storage symptoms after transurethral surgery for bladder outlet obstruction.As was seen in the current study, storage symptoms often take slightly longer to improve compared with voiding symptoms, likely as a result of neuromuscular changes that must take place in the detrusor muscle once the obstruction is removed.

Finally, urgency incontinence is a common symptom in men with LUTS/BPH. Incontinence is likely due to overactive bladder, which develops as a direct result of chronic bladder outlet obstruction through the increased sensitivity of cholinergic receptors and structural changes due to ischaemia of the detrusor muscle.For men with incontinence at baseline, relief of bladder outlet obstruction through waterjet-based prostate resection resulted in improved frequency and severity of incontinence. For men with low baseline incontinence scores (indicating no or only minor problems with incontinence), late scores returned to preoperative values after a brief perioperative rise.

### Male chronic pelvic pain: AUA guideline: part I evaluation and management approach [^520d09dc]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Prostate surgical procedures in CP/CPPS—Clinicians should not perform surgical procedures on the prostate to relieve pelvic pain but may discuss them as part of multimodal therapy in patients with coexisting pain and prostate cancer or bladder outlet obstruction (Expert Opinion). Transurethral resection of the prostate may be indicated for voiding symptoms attributed to BPH or BOO in men with concomitant pelvic pain but should not be offered as a treatment for the chronic pain itself, with an exception when pain can be demonstrated in real time in association with an obstructed void during live urodynamics testing or secondary to elevated PVRs; videourodynamics can identify bladder neck obstruction amenable to transurethral incision. Small series of radical prostatectomy report some improvement in NIH-CPSI, but significant side effects such as ED and incontinence must be considered, and although minimally invasive techniques have been developed, 8% of patients still suffer from a complication.

### Urodynamics and safety of the β ₃-adrenoceptor agonist mirabegron in males with lower urinary tract symptoms and bladder outlet obstruction [^8fc47b42]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Bladder outlet obstruction often presents as storage and voiding symptoms. We investigated urodynamic parameters in men with lower urinary tract symptoms and bladder outlet obstruction treated with the β₃ agonist mirabegron, a new therapy for overactive bladder symptoms.

Materials and Methods

A total of 200 men 45 years old or older with lower urinary tract symptoms and bladder outlet obstruction were randomized to receive once daily mirabegron 50 mg (70) or 100 mg (65), or placebo (65) for 12 weeks. The primary urodynamic parameters assessed were change from baseline to end of treatment in maximum urinary flow and detrusor pressure at maximum urinary flow (noninferiority margins -3 ml per second and 15 cm H2O, respectively). We evaluated adverse events and vital signs.

Results

Treatment with mirabegron 50 and 100 mg was noninferior to placebo based on the lower and upper limits of the 95% CI, respectively, for maximum urinary flow and detrusor pressure at maximum urinary flow. The adjusted mean difference vs placebo was 0.40 (95% CI -0.63, 1.42) and 0.62 ml per second (95% CI -0.43, 1.68) for maximum urinary flow, and -5.94 (95% CI -13.98, 2.09) and -1.39 cm H2O (95% CI -9.73, 6.96), respectively, for detrusor pressure at maximum urinary flow. The incidence of adverse events was similar for mirabegron and placebo.

Conclusions

Mirabegron did not adversely affect voiding urodynamics (maximum urinary flow and detrusor pressure at maximum urinary flow) compared with placebo after 12 weeks of treatment.

### Anterior colporrhaphy does not induce bladder outlet obstruction [^b3477daf]. International Urogynecology Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Concluding message

Urodynamic investigation on the first day after anterior colporrhaphy shows that anterior colporrhaphy carries a low risk of inducing bladder outlet obstruction. The explanation for postoperative development of abnormal PVR should therefore not only be sought in the effects of surgery on the bladder neck and urethra but also involves other non-anatomical explanations such as anxiety, pain and other psychological factors. These possible candidates should be evaluated in order to decrease the prevalence of abnormal PVR and optimise its treatment.

Different medical disciplines have discovered the toxin to treat mainly muscular hypercontraction. In urology, indications for botulinum-A toxin have been neurogenic detrusor overactivity, detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia, motor and sensory urge and, more recently, chronic prostatic pain. The available literature was reviewed using Medline Services. The keywords "botulinum-A toxin", "detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia", "neurogenic bladder", "spinal cord injury", "denervation", "chronic prostatic pain", "chronic urinary retention" were used to obtain references. A toxin injection is effective to treat detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia when injected either transurethrally or transperineally. After treatment, external urethral sphincter pressure, voiding pressure and post-void residual volume decreased. The effect lasts between 2 to 9 months depending on the number of injections. Best indications seem to be multiple sclerosis and incomplete spinal cord injury patients suffering from neurogenic detrusor overactivity and detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia. According to the previous results, the use of botulinum-A toxin injections into the external urethral sphincter has been extended to a variety of bladder obstructions and to decrease outlet resistance in patients with acontractile detrusor. In cases of successful treatment, spontaneous voiding re-occurs and catheterization can be resumed. Injections of the toxin into the external urethral sphincter also seem to have a beneficial effect on chronic prostatic pain, presumably by reducing hypertonicity and hyperactivity of the external urethral sphincter. Injections of botulinum-A toxin into the detrusor muscle has first been tested to treat neurogenic detrusor activity in spinal cord injured patients and in myelomeningocele children. Long lasting (mean 9 months) detrusor relaxation occurs after injection of usually 300 units of Botox). Continence is restored in about 95% of the patients and anticholinergic drugs can be markedly reduced or even stopped. Excellent results of botulinum-A toxin injections into the detrusor in neurogenic detrusor overactivity have lead to an expansion of this treatment to incontinence due to idiopathic detrusor overactivity. Although preliminary results are promising, adequate dosage of the toxin required for this indication is not yet known. In conclusion, it appears that botulinum toxin injection into either the external urethral sphincter or the detrusor offers new promising treatment options for many different urological dysfunctions. However, large controlled trials are absolutely required to establish the role of botulinum-A toxin injections in the fields of urology and neurourology on evidence based medicine.

### Is there evidence for pelvic floor muscle relaxation training in nonneurogenic female bladder outlet obstruction? – A narrative review [^68760272]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

For BOO the rationale for physical therapy and PFMT would be opposite to that of SUI/MUI and POP. For BOO the assumption is that the underlying cause is that the PFM are contracting when they should not (PFM dyssynergia) or that the PFM are overactive/have increased tone.Therefore, the rationale for the training would be to teach the women to perceive the difference between contraction and relaxation of the PFM, to improve the ability to relax before and during voiding and to reduce resting activity of the muscles. According to the International Urogynecological Association (IUGA)/International Continence Society (ICS) joint report on the terminology for the conservative and nonpharmacological management of female pelvic floor dysfunction, relaxation is the ability to control muscle activity such that muscles not specifically required for a task are quiet, and those that are required fire at the minimal level needed to achieve the desired results.General relaxation technique is defined as a technique that involves the whole body, with the aim of effecting a global relaxation, including a decrease in the skeletal and smooth muscles, a decrease in the heart rate and respiration rate, and an increase in parasympathetic activity. General relaxation techniques can also be used aimed at relaxing local muscles such as the PFM.Examples of general relaxation techniques are different breathing exercises. Local muscle relaxation is a progressive muscular relaxation technique (also known as Jacobsen's technique) monitoring tension in each specific muscle group, by contracting, then relaxing the tension, with attention paid to the contrast between tension and relaxation, also termed “contract–relax.”The aim of this narrative review was to give an overview of the current evidence for the effect of PFMT training (strength or relaxation training) for nonneurogenic female BOO.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction: diagnosis and evaluation [^4d5ce8b3]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD)—At initial evaluation, patients with NLUTD who spontaneously void should undergo post-void residual measurement (Clinical Principle). PVR is defined as the volume of urine left in the bladder at the end of micturition, provides valuable information regarding bladder emptying, and when elevated suggests an abnormality of bladder emptying due to detrusor underactivity (DU), bladder outlet obstruction (BOO), or both; a chronically elevated PVR can result in LUTS, as well as complications such as UTIs, bladder stones, and upper urinary tract deterioration.

### Partial bladder outlet obstruction reduces the tissue antioxidant capacity and muscle nerve density of the Guinea pig bladder [^0e8843b6]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2009). Low credibility.

Aims

Reactive nitrogen and oxygen species (RNOS) likely play a role in the development of bladder dysfunction related to bladder outlet obstruction. Antioxidants protect against these free radicals. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of bladder outlet obstruction on the endogenous antioxidant status of the bladder and to correlate this to bladder structure and function.

Methods

In 16 guinea pigs either a partial outlet obstruction or a sham operation was induced. The contractile responses of detrusor strips to electrical field stimulation (EFS), acetylcholine, potassium, and ATP were monitored 4 weeks after the operation. The nerve density in bladder tissue was determined by using the non-specific nerve marker PGP 9.5. Separate antioxidants and the total antioxidant status were assessed using the trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) test.

Results

Contractile responses of detrusor strips to EFS were for the greater part based on neurogenic stimulation. The nerve-mediated responses in strips from obstructed bladders were lower compared to the sham group. Obstructed bladders showed a patchy denervation and the nerve density was significantly lower compared to the sham group. The total antioxidant capacity, the glutathione and the glutathione reductase (GR) levels significantly decreased in obstructed bladders compared to the sham group.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates that the antioxidant status of guinea pig bladders exposed to outlet obstruction decreased which might be associated with the observed reduction in nerve density. The results strengthen the hypothesis that oxidative stress is involved in the pathophysiology of bladder dysfunction related to obstructed bladders. Neurourol. Urodynam. 28:461-467, 2009.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^26a12122]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Evaluation and differential diagnosis in suspected interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) should prioritize exclusion of overlapping conditions, as disorders such as bacterial cystitis, urinary calculi, vaginitis, carcinoma in situ of the bladder, and chronic bacterial prostatitis must be systematically excluded, and the role of other tests has poor specificity for IC/BPS. Clinicians should weigh test risks and benefits; urodynamic evaluation can identify bladder outlet obstruction or detrusor overactivity, but sensory urgency at low bladder volumes with or without detrusor overactivity is not specific for IC/BPS. In general, additional tests should be undertaken only if findings will alter the treatment approach.

### Endoscopic evacuation of durasphere [^278a4f7e]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Durasphere is a urethral bulking agent used to treat stress urinary incontinence secondary to intrinsic sphincter deficiency. Although rare, chronic outlet obstruction and urinary retention are possible complications of this "permanent" bulking agent. We describe the endoscopic evacuation of Durasphere causing bladder outlet obstruction 1 year after being injected.

### Chronic ischemia alters prostate structure and reactivity in rabbits [^4386be15]. The Journal of Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

Autopsy studies performed in men older than 80 years old have demonstrated that 90% have histological evidence of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Despite this fact pressure flow studies in men of this age who are referred for the evaluation of lower urinary tract symptoms have shown that only 40% have evidence of bladder outlet obstruction. To our knowledge the specific features of benign prostatic hyperplasia responsible for bladder outlet obstruction are not known. To investigate the possible etiological factors responsible for bladder outlet obstruction we determined whether chronic ischemia alters the structural and functional properties of the prostate.

Materials and Methods

Male New Zealand White rabbits weighing 3.5 to 4 kg. were divided into a chronic prostate ischemia (12), hypercholesterolemia (8) and age matched control (8) group. The chronic prostate ischemia group underwent balloon endothelial injury of the iliac arteries and received a 0.5% cholesterol diet, the hypercholesterolemia group received a 0.5% cholesterol diet only and controls received a regular diet. After 12 weeks using anesthesia iliac artery and prostatic blood flow was measured by an ultrasonic and laser Doppler flowmeter, respectively. The animals were then sacrificed and the prostate was processed for histological evaluation, immunohistochemical staining for vascular endothelial growth factor expression and organ bath studies.

Results

Iliac artery and prostatic blood flow was significantly decreased in the chronic prostate ischemia compared with the hypercholesterolemia and control groups. Histological findings included thickening and fibrosis of the prostatic stroma and cystic atrophy of the epithelium in the chronic prostate ischemia group as well as minor thickening of the stroma in the hypercholesterolemia group. These structural changes correlated with decreased vascular endothelial growth factor expression. Organ bath studies showed that chronic ischemia and to a lesser extent hypercholesterolemia impaired electrical field stimulation induced neurogenic relaxation of the prostatic tissue. Neurogenic relaxation of the prostatic tissue was improved by combined treatment with indomethacin and L-arginine in the hypercholesterolemia but not in the chronic prostate ischemia group. Nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside produced comparable relaxation in all 3 groups.

Conclusions

Chronic ischemia causes marked changes in prostatic structure and contractility. Ischemia induced glandular atrophy was consistently associated with decreased vascular endothelial growth factor expression. Decreased relaxation of the ischemic tissue to electrical field stimulation appears to involve the nitric oxide pathway. The nitric oxide precursor L-arginine reversed hypercholesterolemia induced impairment of prostatic tissue relaxation. Our study suggests that chronic ischemia results in thickening and fibrosis of the prostate, changing its mechanical properties. Chronic ischemia also impairs neurogenic relaxation in the prostate. We discuss the possible relationship of these changes to clinical bladder outlet obstruction.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^c464f7c6]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Determining the evidence strength—The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to determine the aggregate evidence quality for each outcome informing Guideline Statements, with evidence categorized as high, moderate, low, and very low, and assessment based on the aggregate risk of bias with limitations from inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias; upgrading is possible if the body of evidence indicates a large effect or if confounding factors would suggest either spurious effects or would reduce the demonstrated effect. The American Urological Association employs a 3-tiered strength of evidence system in which high certainty by GRADE translates to A category strength of evidence, moderate to B, and both low and very low to C.

### Effect of catheter size on urodynamic assessment of bladder outlet obstruction [^654ea3a2]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine the effect of cross-sectional catheter diameter on urodynamic measurement of bladder outlet obstruction as predicted by the Abrams-Griffiths nomogram.

Methods

Thirty-one patients with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia underwent free flow measurements followed by pressure-flow urodynamic evaluation using 5F and 10F urethral catheters in randomly assigned order. The measurements of voided volume, maximal flow rate (Qmax), postvoid residual volume, and detrusor pressure at maximal flow (PdetQmax) were compared. Data points were then plotted on the Abrams-Griffiths nomogram, and categorization of bladder outlet obstruction was assigned for each catheter size.

Results

The use of 10F catheters resulted in both a significant decrease in Qmax and increase in PdetQmax compared with the use of 5F catheters. Of 31 patients, 10 (32%) were incorrectly categorized as obstructed according to the Abrams-Griffiths nomogram when the larger sized catheter was used, and 17 (55%) experienced migration from a less obstructed to a more obstructed category.

Conclusions

The use of 5F catheters allows for more accurate diagnosis of bladder outlet obstruction. In urodynamic evaluations, the larger size 10F catheters should be avoided, especially in patients with borderline symptoms.

### Lrig2 and hpse2, mutated in urofacial syndrome, pattern nerves in the urinary bladder [^3bbcb3a0]. Kidney International (2019). Medium credibility.

Mutations in leucine-rich-repeats and immunoglobulin-like-domains 2 (LRIG2) or in heparanase 2 (HPSE2) cause urofacial syndrome, a devastating autosomal recessive disease of functional bladder outlet obstruction. It has been speculated that urofacial syndrome has a neural basis, but it is unknown whether defects in urinary bladder innervation are present. We hypothesized that urofacial syndrome features a peripheral neuropathy of the bladder. Mice with homozygous targeted Lrig2 mutations had urinary defects resembling those found in urofacial syndrome. There was no anatomical blockage of the outflow tract, consistent with a functional bladder outlet obstruction. Transcriptome analysis revealed differential expression of 12 known transcripts in addition to Lrig2, including 8 with established roles in neurobiology. Mice with homozygous mutations in either Lrig2 or Hpse2 had increased nerve density within the body of the urinary bladder and decreased nerve density around the urinary outflow tract. In a sample of 155 children with chronic kidney disease and urinary symptoms, we discovered novel homozygous missense LRIG2 variants that were predicted to be pathogenic in 2 individuals with non-syndromic bladder outlet obstruction. These observations provide evidence that a peripheral neuropathy is central to the pathobiology of functional bladder outlet obstruction in urofacial syndrome, and emphasize the importance of LRIG2 and heparanase 2 for nerve patterning in the urinary tract.

### Bladder outflow obstruction in women: clinical and basic evaluation [^4709708f]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Aim

Female bladder outflow obstruction is an underdiagnosed and undermanaged condition. This review article aims to illustrate the basic and clinical evaluation of patients who might have this condition.

Review

Clinical evaluation includes clinical history, examination, and basic investigations, including uroflowmetry and postvoid residual, urinalysis and culture, renal function assessment, ultrasound of kidneys and bladder, voiding cystourethrography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Based on the initial evaluation, if the concern of obstruction is high, the clinician might undergo further advanced evaluation.

Conclusion

Basic evaluation is the initial step in the diagnosis of female bladder outflow obstruction, the clinician need to have a high index of suspicion and often further advanced evaluation is needed to confirm the diagnosis.

### Perinatal urinary tract dilation: recommendations on pre-/ postnatal imaging, prophylactic antibiotics, and follow-up: clinical Report [^ace94fc5]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Severe bilateral urinary tract dilation—evaluation and early management are specified: The preceding recommendations in this report are not primarily aimed at cases of severe bilateral UTD; patients with severe bilateral UTD with dilated ureters, abnormal bladder morphology, and oligohydramnios should be evaluated for underlying causes of bladder outlet obstruction, which include posterior urethral valves, urethral atresia, prune belly syndrome, pelvic masses, and spinal dysraphism. If bladder outlet obstruction is suspected prenatally, parents should receive appropriate counseling regarding differential diagnoses, possible effects on bladder and kidney function, and possible postnatal evaluation and management strategies. Postnatally, infants with suspected bladder outlet obstruction should undergo prompt urology and nephrology consultation, bladder decompression, appropriate imaging, and initiation of antibiotic prophylaxis, ideally within 48 hours of life. Assessment of overall kidney function with serum testing is also necessary, but it should be remembered that serum creatinine in the neonate will reflect maternal creatinine in the first few days of life.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^30b29fc6]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)—utilization trends and evolving indications: Between 1999 and 2005 there was a 5% per year decrease in TURP with a further 19.8% decrease from 2005 to 2008, and patients now undergoing surgery are generally older with more comorbidities; the indication of “failure of medical therapy” rose from essentially 0% in 1988 to 87% in 2008, while long-standing bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) from BPH can progress to incomplete bladder emptying, bilateral hydroureteronephrosis, and acute and/or chronic renal insufficiency.

### Urethral orifice hyaluronic acid injections: a novel animal model of bladder outlet obstruction [^635b1e4f]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

The partial bladder neck ligation model is widely used in many studies on BOO, but the procedure is complex and there is a high risk of complications. Operative time and the degree of ligation are difficult to standardize, and severe inflammation around the urethral ligation can often result in excessive obstruction. Further, the fibrous scar in the abdominal skin and muscle, which does not occur in patients with BOO, may affect the accuracy studies using this model. Placing a metal ring loosely around the proximal urethra has been used to create BOO models. However, rejection of the foreign material is difficult to avoid.

Using bulking agents to increase bladder outlet resistance has been used in urinary incontinence treatment for some human patients. However, clinical case reports indicate that periurethral polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) injection can cause BOO in some patients.

Hyaluronic acid is an anionic, nonsulfated glycosaminoglycan that is distributed widely throughout connective, epithelial, and neural tissues. It is popular for filling soft tissue defects such as facial wrinkles or lip augmentation in plastic surgery because it is effective, easy to administer, and safe. Some urologists have attempted to use hyaluronic acid injection to treat vesicoureteral reflux in children [-]. Hyaluronic acid is biocompatible and can be exist stably in the body, so it could be used to observe long-term pathophysiological changes in some chronic diseases. Clinical trials indicate that hyaluronic acid can persist up to 6–18 after injection in humans. Therefore, hyaluronic acid appears to be a perfect agent to creating and simulating urinary obstruction. However, no reported BOO model has been produced by subcutaneous injection of hyaluronic acid.

### Tamsulosin hydrochloride [^8ff7c27a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) are related to bladder outlet obstruction, which is comprised of two underlying components: static and dynamic. The static component is related to an increase in prostate size caused, in part, by a proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the prostatic stroma. However, the severity of BPH symptoms and the degree of urethral obstruction do not correlate well with the size of the prostate. The dynamic component is a function of an increase in smooth muscle tone in the prostate and bladder neck leading to constriction of the bladder outlet.  Smooth muscle tone is mediated by the sympathetic nervous stimulation of alpha1adrenoceptors, which are abundant in the prostate, prostatic capsule, prostatic urethra, and bladder neck. Blockade of these adrenoceptors can cause smooth muscles in the bladder neck and prostate to relax, resulting in an improvement in urine flow rate and a reduction in symptoms of BPH.

Tamsulosin, an alpha1adrenoceptor blocking agent, exhibits selectivity for alpha1receptors in the human prostate. At least three discrete alpha1adrenoceptor subtypes have been identified: alpha1A, alpha1B, and alpha1D; their distribution differs between human organs and tissue. Approximately 70% of the alpha1receptors in the human prostate are of the alpha1Asubtype.

Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are not intended for use as an antihypertensive drug.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Urologic pharmacodynamic effects have been evaluated in neurologically impaired pediatric patients and in adults with BPH [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14)] .

### Effect of oral kohki tea on bladder dysfunction induced by severe partial outlet obstruction [^f6632d2d]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

Extracts of the leaves of Engelhardtia chrysolepis, a subtropical plant that grows wild in southern China, have been used medicinally in east Asia for hundreds of years. A standard extract named Kohki tea (Maruzen Pharmaceuticals, Onomichi City, Japan) is sold over the counter in Japan as a sweet tea shown to confer many beneficial effects on general health and well-being. The tea contains strong antioxidants, including several dihydroflavonol glycosides. The results of previous studies show that natural products with antioxidant activities provide protective effects on the bladder of rabbits with partial outlet obstruction. We determined in vivo and in vitro whether oral pretreatment of rabbits with Kohki tea protects the bladder from dysfunction induced by partial outlet obstruction.

Materials and Methods

A total of 28 New Zealand White rabbits were separated into 4 groups of 7 each. Rabbits in groups 1 and 2 were treated by gavage with 100 mg./kg. Kohki tea daily in distilled water, while those in groups 3 and 4 were given distilled water. After 4 weeks of daily oral administration each rabbit was sedated, the bladder was catheterized and cystometry was performed at a filling rate of 1 ml. per minute. At the completion of cystometry the rabbits were immediately anesthetized. Moderate outlet obstruction was created in groups 1 and 3, and sham surgery was performed in groups 2 and 4. Treatment was continued for an additional 4 weeks, when each rabbit was sedated and cystometry was repeated. After cystometry the bladder was exposed through a midline incision, excised, weighed and 4 strips of bladder body were cut for contractility studies. The balance of the bladder was separated between smooth muscle and mucosa by blunt dissection, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70C for biochemical analyses.

Results

Partial outlet obstruction stimulated similar increases in the bladder weight of all obstructed rabbits. Partial outlet obstruction resulted in a significant decrease in bladder compliance in all obstructed animals. However, the bladder of obstructed rabbits given Kohki tea were significantly more compliant than those given water. Voiding pressures in the control group and the obstructed group given distilled water were approximately equal, while obstructed rabbits given Kohki tea showed significantly higher maximal voiding pressure. The contractile responses to all forms of stimulation were reduced by obstruction to a significantly greater degree in the rabbits not given tea than in those given tea. Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-adenosine triphosphatase enzyme activity of the bladder was significantly reduced in obstructed rabbits given vehicle but activity was not reduced in obstructed rabbits given Kohki tea.

Conclusions

Kohki tea had a significant protective effect on bladder function, contractile responses and bladder biochemistry in rabbits with moderate to severe partial outlet obstruction.

### Male chronic pelvic pain: AUA guideline: part I evaluation and management approach [^22645975]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is defined by pain or discomfort in the pelvic region for at least three months within the past six months in the absence of identifiable causes of pain. Pain can occur in the perineum, lower abdomen/suprapubic area, testes, or penis, may occur with ejaculation or during urination, and is often associated with sexual dysfunction and ED. CP/CPPS may be associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), fibromyalgia, migraine, and chronic fatigue syndrome, and the clinical presentation can be quite variable. Variability includes many men presenting with symptom duration of less than three months; although these men would not be entered into a clinical trial, they should still be evaluated based on the presence of pain, and strict definitions used in research or clinical trials should be avoided in clinical practice. CP/CPPS is a diagnosis of exclusion, with confusable disorders including UTI, urogenital cancer, prior radiation or chemotherapy, urethral stricture, neurologic disease affecting the bladder, or bladder outlet obstruction (BOO). Pelvic pain or discomfort is the cardinal symptom distinguishing CP/CPPS from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is characterized by lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

### Chapter 2: pathophysiology of neurogenic detrusor overactivity and the symptom complex of "overactive bladder" [^58244c72]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2014). Low credibility.

It is now clearly recognized that the function of the lower urinary tract represents a complex interaction between the bladder and its outlet, acting under the control of the central nervous system. While in the past attention has principally focused on the motor (efferent) control of the bladder, sensory (afferent) innervation is now known to be an important therapeutic target. This change in emphasis is strongly supported by both basic science and clinical evidence demonstrating the efficacy of therapy directed at the afferent system. This chapter summarizes the neurophysiological control mechanism that underpins normal lower urinary tract function, emphasizing the importance of the afferent system as a potential therapeutic target.

### Preventive effect of hydrogen water on the development of detrusor overactivity in a rat model of bladder outlet obstruction [^915569dd]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Bladder ischemia and oxidative stress contribute to the pathogenesis of bladder dysfunction caused by bladder outlet obstruction. H2 reportedly acts as an effective antioxidant. We investigated whether oral ingestion of H2 water would have a beneficial effect on bladder function in a rat model of bladder outlet obstruction.

Materials and Methods

H2 water was made by dissolving H2 gas in ordinary drinking water using a hydrogen water producing apparatus. The bladder outlet obstruction model was surgically induced in male rats. Rats with obstruction were fed H2 water or ordinary drinking water. On week 4 postoperatively cystometry was performed. Oxidative stress markers and the bladder nerve growth factor level were determined. Bladder tissues were processed for pharmacological studies and histological analysis.

Results

The micturition interval and micturition volume significantly decreased in obstructed rats given ordinary drinking water. These decreases were significantly suppressed by oral ingestion of H2 water. Increased post-void residual volume in obstructed rats was significantly reduced by H2 water. Obstruction led to a significant increase in bladder weight, oxidative stress markers and nerve growth factor. H2 water significantly suppressed these increases without affecting bladder weight. There was no significant difference in histological findings between rats with bladder obstruction given H2 water and ordinary drinking water. Decreased responses of detrusor muscle strips from obstructed bladders to KCl, carbachol and electrical field stimulation were reversed by H2 water ingestion.

Conclusions

Results suggest that H2 water could ameliorate bladder dysfunction secondary to bladder outlet obstruction by attenuating oxidative stress.

### Chronic severe constipation: current pathophysiological aspects, new diagnostic approaches, and therapeutic options [^c1031445]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic constipation is a considerable problem because it significantly affects the quality of a patient's life. Constipation can be diagnosed at every age and is more frequent in women and among the elderly. In epidemiological studies, its incidence is estimated at 2-27% in the general population. Chronic constipation may be primary or secondary. However, primary constipation (functional or idiopathic) can be classified into normal transit constipation, slow transit constipation, and pelvic outlet obstruction. In this review we make an attempt to present the current pathophysiological aspects and new therapeutic options for chronic idiopathic constipation, particularly highlighting the value of patient assessment for accurate diagnosis of the cause of the problem, thus helping in the choice of appropriate treatment.

### New insights into bloating and abdominal distension: is it all outlet obstruction? [^287253f9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

The sensation of bloating, a common but poorly understood problem, is the subject of two papers in this issue. The first study showed that patients with bloating as their main complaint have delayed clearance of infused gas from the colon, while the second study showed that bloaters had impaired defecation. Together, these studies suggest that behavioral factors may be important in this important symptom complex and propose novel approaches to its treatment.

### The clinical significance of the subtypes of detrusor overactivity: a systematic review [^5ada2dad]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Definitions

This systematic review will incorporate defined terminology as described by the ICS to maintain consistency and precision across all discussions about detrusor overactivity. Relevant definitions used in this review are summarised in Table 1.

TABLE 1 
A table of defined terminology relevant to this systematic review.

If a treatable, suspected underlying cause of DO, such as bladder outflow obstruction, is identified, patients often undergo treatment for obstruction in the first instance. Owing to the symptoms which DO normally leads to, patients with DO, who have received treatment for any rectifiable underlying cause, are normally managed with a variety of treatments ranging from anticholinergics and beta‐3 adrenoceptor agonists to intradetrusor injections of OnabotulinumtoxinA or neuromodulation. While extensive research has investigated the effectiveness of these therapies on the general population with DO, there remains a notable gap in the literature currently, with few studies specifically assessing the clinical significance of PDO and TDO.

The aim of this systematic review is to ascertain any clinical significance between the different subtypes of DO in terms of demographics, underlying pathophysiology, symptomology, urodynamic parameters and response to treatment.

### The beneficial effect of coenzyme Q10 and lipoic acid on obstructive bladder dysfunction in the rabbit [^f08cdb72]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Recent evidence indicates that ischemia and reperfusion are major etiological factors in the bladder dysfunction that occurs after partial bladder outlet obstruction. Coenzyme Q10 and alpha-lipoic acid are found naturally in mitochondria and act as potent antioxidants. We investigated the beneficial effects of coenzyme Q10 plus alpha-lipoic acid in a rabbit model of bladder outlet obstruction.

Materials and Methods

Twenty male rabbits were divided into 5 groups. Group 1 served as control and group 2 received three weeks of coenzyme Q10 plus alpha-lipoic acid supplementation. Rabbits in group 3 underwent surgical partial bladder outlet obstruction for duration of four weeks and groups 4 and 5 were obstructed for seven weeks. In group 5, coenzyme Q10 plus alpha-lipoic acid supplementation was given following 4 weeks obstruction and continued till the end of the seven weeks. The contractile responses to various agents were determined. The protein nitration and carbonylation levels were studied by immunoblotting. Nerve function was determined by choline acetyltransferase activity and nerve density.

Results

The contractile responses to different forms of stimulations, including field stimulation, ATP, carbachol and KCl all showed decreases following 4 and 7 weeks obstruction. Treatment with coenzyme Q10 plus alpha-lipoic acid significantly restored contractile responses to all forms of stimulation. Treatment also had mitochondrial and neuronal effects and reduced protein nitration and carbonylation. Histologically there was less detrusor muscle hypertrophy.

Conclusions

The current study clearly demonstrates that coenzyme Q10 and alpha-lipoic acid supplementation can improve bladder function after outlet obstruction.

### ACR-ACNM-SNMMI-SPR practice parameter for the performance of radionuclide cystography [^327b1b32]. ACR/SNMMI/SPR/ACNM (2025). High credibility.

Radionuclide cystography—image acquisition and patient positioning—states that imaging is performed with a low-energy collimator, and during filling the pelvis and abdomen are imaged continuously in the posterior projection with the patient lying in a supine position, while during voiding, images are obtained continuously. If the camera set-up permits, adults and toilet-trained children who are able to sit may be imaged while seated upright on a bedpan or toilet; if seated imaging is not feasible or the patient cannot sit on a bedpan, imaging may be performed in the supine position. If reflux occurs during filling of the bladder, the volume at which reflux occurred should be recorded, and special care should be taken to estimate maximum bladder capacity in patients with a history of neurogenic bladder or chronic bladder outlet obstruction, with clinical judgement needed on a case-by-case basis. When the bladder fills to maximum capacity, the patient should be instructed to void with continuous image acquisition until the bladder is empty, and postvoid posterior images of the bladder should be obtained in either the supine or upright position after bladder emptying is complete. If the patient cannot void on request or voids incompletely, the degree of bladder emptying should be recorded, and on occasion, it may be appropriate to perform more than one cycle of bladder filling and voiding. At the end of the study, if there is substantial residual volume (RV), the bladder should be drained through the urinary catheter if it remains in place, and the drained volume should be recorded.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement on evaluation of obstructed defecation [^38cae35b]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Obstructed defecation—definitions, prevalence, and relationship to pelvic organ prolapse (POP) are outlined as follows: The sensation of anorectal obstruction or blocking is one of many criteria that may be used to diagnose constipation, and chronic constipation (symptoms > 6 months) is common, with a prevalence in the general population of approximately 14%. A more detailed definition is provided by the Rome classification system (currently Rome III diagnostic criteria). Causes of constipation vary widely and include systemic medical issues, obstructive intestinal disease, and medication adverse effects, most notably related to narcotic and anticholinergic medications; chronic constipation is often divided into disordered colonic transit (slow-transit constipation) and normal transit, which includes pelvic floor or anorectal dysfunction (outlet obstruction constipation or obstructive defecation syndrome). Obstructive defecation is incomplete rectal evacuation that may result from inadequate rectal propulsive forces and/or increased resistance to evacuation and can be related to dyssynergic defecation or anatomic abnormalities (rectoceles, enteroceles, internal rectal intussusception). Posterior compartment prolapse is a condition in which the posterior vaginal wall descends toward the vaginal opening and includes rectoceles, enteroceles, sigmoidocele, intussusception, and perineal descent, and among postmenopausal women, the prevalence of posterior vaginal wall prolapse is 18%. Anorectal dysfunction symptoms potentially prolapse related include constipation, feeling of incomplete bowel evacuation, straining to defecate, sensation of anorectal blockage, splinting or digitations, fecal urgency, and postdefecatory soiling; however, these symptoms can often be related to other etiologies, such as slow-transit constipation, which may require different treatment strategies.

### Posterior urethral valves: 10 years audit of epidemiologic, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects in yaoundégynaeco-obstetric and paediatric hospital [^ad292734]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Posterior urethral valve (PUV) is the most common lower urinary tract congenital anomaly in boys with an incidence of 1: 5000–1:8000 males. It is the leading cause of bladder outlet obstruction and renal insufficiency in male children. The incidence is unknown in our sub-region. In Nigeria, Uba et al. in Jos, reported 3–8 cases per annum and Jaja et al. in Port Harcourt observed that it accounted for 1 in 2447 children seen in their hospital.

This disease was first described by Morgagni in 1717 and later by Langenbeck in 1802. The exact embryology and aetiology of this condition are not known.

PUV has detrimental and wide-ranging effects on the global development of the kidney, bladder and the entire urinary system. This result from persistent and unrelieved pressure on the bladder leading to bladder diverticular, hydronephrosis and chronic to end-stage renal diseases (ESRD). The anomaly is associated with high mortality and morbidity including urosepsis, overflow urinary incontinence, chronic kidney diseases (CKD), hypertension, chronic anaemia, failure to thrive, poor quality of life and even death.

Early diagnosis can be made prenatally by regular and routine prenatal ultrasounds. The routine use of this modality has significantly increased early diagnosis and management of this pathology in most developed countries. As prenatal hydronephrosis usually prompts an early and complete work up at birth with a voiding cysto-urethrogram (VCUG) leading to early postnatal diagnosis. Prenatal ultrasound uptakes are still at low levels in our environment.

Initial continuous catheter drainage and or vesicostomy and eventual management by endoscopic valve resection, usually ameliorate the obstructive uropathy. However, it has been noted that even after surgical treatment of valves and relief of obstruction, about 70% of older children and adolescents continue to have persistent bladder dysfunction, poor quality of life, and worsening CKD and ESRD. Long-term management of PUV constitutes a challenge in the practice of pediatric urology in our environment due to lack of specialized centers as well as the paucity of trained pediatric urologists and nephrologists to evaluate and monitor these children. In the few highly specialized centers where valve ablation is done, most patients fail to turn up for follow-up visits due to an erroneous belief that it has been cured following the initial relief of the obstruction.

### Diagnosis and treatment of overactive bladder (non-neurogenic) in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^99f793fe]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) general principles—OAB is not a disease and no treatment is an acceptable choice after assessment, and clinicians should provide education regarding normal lower urinary tract function, what is known about OAB, the benefits vs. risks/burdens of alternatives, and that acceptable symptom control may require trials of multiple therapeutic options before it is achieved.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^cb62255d]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU Guideline on Overactive Bladder—shared decision‑making approach emphasizes that diagnosis and management are complex because research has not identified a unifying pathophysiology and diagnostic testing has not led to reliable patterns that can guide treatment; nascent research has focused on phenotyping OAB and identifying predictors of treatment outcomes, and incorporating these into shared decision‑making can help clinicians and patients select the best treatment modality and improve outcomes. The text states that we should strive for upfront and clear communication with patients regarding OAB as a poorly understood and chronic syndrome, with interventions designed to mitigate symptoms rather than to treat or resolve an underlying condition, and that shared decision‑making should include a plan of care with emphasis on multiple modalities acceptable to the patient to optimize response.

Table 2—class-specific considerations for antihypertensive therapy in kidney transplant recipients: Dihydropyridine CCBs attenuate the vasoconstrictive effect of calcineurin inhibitors and minimize risk for drug-drug interactions but may increase proteinuria; ARBs may suppress proteinuria but are associated with risk of hyperkalemia, risk of worsening anemia, and a hemodynamic effect on eGFR which may be confused with graft dysfunction; other options include diuretics, which may increase risk for acute kidney injury when used concurrently with ARB or calcineurin inhibitor, especially in the setting of acute illnesses that predispose to volume depletion, β Blockers, which are useful in patients with coronary artery disease, heart failure, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and α Blocker, which is useful in prostatic hypertrophy and bladder outlet obstruction but may predispose to symptomatic orthostasis.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^7388d1f7]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU overactive bladder guideline—literature search and study selection—states that “Databases were searched for studies published from January 2013 through November 2023,” and “In addition to the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases searches, reference lists of included systematic reviews and primary literature were scanned for potentially useful studies.” For all research questions, eligible designs were “randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, modelling studies with theoretical cohorts, and case-control studies,” and “For all Key Questions, studies had to enroll at least 30 patients per study arm.” The pharmacotherapy comparison Key Question “was limited to RCTs based on a priori knowledge of multiple trials evaluating OAB oral medications,” with exclusions including “Case series, letters, editorials, in vitro studies, studies conducted in animal models, and studies not published in English.” During full-text review, panel members paired with the methodologist completed “duplicate full-text study selection of 10% of studies undergoing full-text review.”
