## Question

How does metformin help with PCOS?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how metformin helps with PCOS. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of PCOS and whether metformin's mechanism maps onto it. Then, I should verify metformin's pharmacologic mechanisms and their relevance to PCOS. Next, I will review guideline positioning to anchor clinical use. After that, I should appraise the evidence by domain — metabolic, hormonal/reproductive, fertility, pregnancy, and adolescent care — and check for limitations and biases. Finally, I will translate this into a pragmatic, risk-stratified approach with dosing and safety, while noting where my initial assumptions might need correction as I go along.

> Let me first confirm the PCOS pathophysiology I'm targeting. PCOS is characterized by hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance that amplify ovarian and adrenal androgen production, contributing to hyperandrogenism, anovulation, and cardiometabolic risk; obesity synergistically worsens insulin resistance and clinical severity, so any intervention that reduces insulin should theoretically mitigate downstream features [^113icam2] [^112pBJgB] [^114ykfim].

> Now, I need to check whether metformin's mechanism aligns with that biology. Metformin reduces hepatic gluconeogenesis, increases peripheral glucose uptake, and enhances insulin sensitivity via AMPK activation; it also accumulates in the gut, inhibits mitochondrial complex I, and modulates gut microbiota and incretins, which can indirectly reduce hyperinsulinemia and hyperandrogenism without causing hypoglycemia, making it mechanistically plausible for PCOS [^111EFtmn] [^115qAjmS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify where guidelines place metformin clinically. The 2023 international guideline recommends metformin primarily for metabolic indications in adults with PCOS, especially with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m², and as a second-line option for cycle regulation when combined oral contraceptives are contraindicated or not tolerated. It is not first-line for hirsutism/acne, obesity per se, or ovulation induction, and it is not routinely recommended in pregnancy, aligning with a targeted rather than blanket approach [^111WRzTZ] [^111GXWnL] [^112uYBUj].

> Next, I should review metabolic outcomes. Metformin consistently improves insulin resistance indices and lowers fasting insulin, with modest weight/BMI reductions and favorable effects on lipids, particularly triglycerides; benefits appear greater in those with higher BMI or baseline insulin resistance, and extended-release formulations improve tolerability, though absolute weight loss is modest and should not be overpromised [^115cGrKh] [^114ykfim] [^111WRzTZ].

> I will now examine hormonal and reproductive effects. Metformin lowers total testosterone and free androgen index and can improve menstrual cyclicity, but it is less effective than combined oral contraceptives for cycle regulation and hirsutism. Combined therapy may yield additive biochemical benefits, yet clinical superiority is limited, so expectations should be calibrated to symptom targets and patient preference [^112eYHps] [^114GNNXz] [^112ufAmH].

> Wait, let me verify the fertility data because this is often misunderstood. Metformin increases ovulation versus placebo, but it is inferior to letrozole or clomiphene for ovulation, pregnancy, and live birth. Adding metformin to clomiphene can modestly improve ovulation and pregnancy rates, and metformin may reduce OHSS risk in IVF with agonist protocols, but it is not first-line for ovulation induction and should be framed as adjunctive or alternative when indicated [^114N54Uq] [^112YVDhs] [^1146Tawy].

> I should double-check pregnancy guidance. Metformin is not routinely recommended in pregnancy, but it may be considered selectively to reduce preterm birth or limit excess gestational weight gain in PCOS; evidence is mixed for preventing gestational diabetes or preeclampsia, and long-term offspring metabolic effects remain uncertain, so shared decision-making and individualized risk assessment are essential [^114He3Hn] [^112itjoo] [^1174jRr1].

> Let me consider adolescents specifically. In adolescents with PCOS or at risk, metformin can lower testosterone and improve menstrual regularity, with favorable metabolic effects, but evidence quality is limited. Guidelines allow consideration of metformin, particularly with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m², while emphasizing lifestyle and careful diagnostic caution in this age group [^111WRzTZ] [^115av4dT] [^114gshAp].

> But wait, what about safety and practicalities. Metformin is generally safe with mostly mild, dose-dependent gastrointestinal effects mitigated by slow titration and extended-release formulations; rare lactic acidosis risk rises with renal impairment, and long-term use warrants periodic vitamin B12 monitoring; these safety considerations should be integrated into dosing and follow-up plans [^111WRzTZ] [^111EFtmn] [^114pjZzG].

> Hold on, I should verify the strength and limitations of the evidence. Many trials are small, short-term, and heterogeneous in populations and outcomes, leading to low-to-moderate certainty. Meta-analytic benefits are modest on average, and individual response varies by phenotype, BMI, and insulin resistance, reinforcing the need for tailored therapy and realistic counseling [^113i3hP8] [^115W1pxZ].

> Let me translate this into a pragmatic approach. For adults with PCOS and metabolic features, especially BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² or impaired glucose tolerance, metformin is reasonable alongside lifestyle. For menstrual irregularity or hyperandrogenic symptoms, combined oral contraceptives are first-line, with metformin as adjunct or alternative when contraceptives are unsuitable. For infertility, letrozole is first-line, with metformin considered in clomiphene-resistant cases, in IVF OHSS prevention strategies, or when patient preference and metabolic risk align. In adolescents, metformin can be considered with caution and lifestyle emphasis. Throughout, use shared decision-making and monitor for GI intolerance, B12 status, and renal function as indicated [^111WRzTZ] [^112YVDhs] [^1146Tawy].

> Hmm, wait a minute — earlier I almost implied metformin is broadly "first-line for PCOS", but I should correct that to be precise: metformin is first-line for metabolic indications in appropriate adults, not for all PCOS symptoms, and it is not a substitute for lifestyle or for ovulation agents in infertility, which aligns with contemporary guideline hierarchies and the modest magnitude of average benefits seen in pooled analyses [^111WRzTZ] [^112YVDhs] [^115cGrKh].

Metformin helps PCOS by **improving insulin sensitivity** [^111EFtmn] and **reducing hyperinsulinemia**, which lowers androgen production and improves menstrual regularity and ovulation [^114N54Uq]. It is most beneficial for women with **insulin resistance** or obesity, modestly aiding weight loss and metabolic health, but is not first-line for ovulation induction or hyperandrogenic symptoms like hirsutism or acne [^111WRzTZ] [^112ufAmH]. Metformin is generally safe in pregnancy and may reduce preterm birth, but long-term offspring effects remain uncertain [^114He3Hn] [^1174jRr1]. It is best used as adjunct therapy alongside lifestyle measures and, when needed, ovulation agents such as letrozole or clomiphene [^112YVDhs].

---

## Mechanisms of action relevant to PCOS

Metformin's therapeutic effects in PCOS are mediated through several **interconnected mechanisms**:

- **Insulin sensitization**: Reduces hepatic gluconeogenesis and increases peripheral glucose uptake, lowering insulin and hyperinsulinemia [^111EFtmn] [^115qAjmS].

- **Reduction of hyperandrogenism**: Lower insulin decreases ovarian and adrenal androgen production, improving hirsutism and acne [^116WbzBg] [^115p5DG2] [^112pBJgB].

- **AMPK activation**: Enhances glucose uptake, fatty acid oxidation, and reduces inflammatory signaling, improving metabolic and reproductive outcomes [^111EFtmn].

- **Gut microbiota modulation**: Alters microbiota and increases GLP-1, aiding glycemic control and weight management [^111EFtmn].

---

## Clinical benefits of metformin in PCOS

Metformin provides **modest but meaningful benefits** across metabolic, reproductive, and pregnancy-related outcomes:

| **Clinical domain** | **Beneficial effects of metformin** |
|-|-|
| Metabolic | - Improved insulin sensitivity [^114GNNXz] <br/> - Reduced fasting insulin [^114N54Uq] <br/> - Modest weight loss (≈2–3 kg) [^117LjRtm] <br/> - Improved lipid profiles (↓ LDL, triglycerides) [^114N54Uq] [^114GNNXz] |
| Reproductive | - Improved menstrual regularity [^117LjRtm] <br/> - Increased ovulation rates [^114N54Uq] <br/> - Reduced androgen levels (testosterone, free androgen index) [^115cGrKh] |
| Pregnancy | - Reduced preterm birth [^114He3Hn] <br/> - Limited gestational weight gain [^114He3Hn] <br/> - Uncertain long-term offspring effects [^1174jRr1] |

---

## Limitations and side effects

Despite benefits, metformin has **important limitations**:

- **Modest efficacy**: Effects on weight, ovulation, and androgenic symptoms are modest compared to lifestyle and other pharmacotherapies [^114NxgEP] [^111WRzTZ].

- **Gastrointestinal side effects**: Nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort are common but usually mild and self-limiting [^111WRzTZ] [^114pjZzG].

- **Vitamin B12 deficiency**: Long-term use may cause B12 deficiency; periodic monitoring is advised [^111WRzTZ] [^114pjZzG].

- **Not first-line for ovulation**: Less effective than letrozole or clomiphene for ovulation induction; use as adjunct or alternative when first-line agents are contraindicated or ineffective [^112YVDhs] [^114KMFar].

---

## Comparison with other treatments

Metformin is **often compared** with other PCOS therapies:

- **Lifestyle interventions**: Diet and exercise are first-line and achieve greater weight loss and metabolic improvement than metformin alone [^111N8qV2].

- **Combined oral contraceptives (COCPs)**: Superior for menstrual regulation and hyperandrogenic symptoms; metformin is preferred for metabolic indications [^112ufAmH] [^112eYHps].

- **Ovulation induction agents**: Letrozole and clomiphene are superior to metformin for ovulation and live birth; metformin may be added to improve outcomes in selected patients [^111nYUPi] [^112vnaZr].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **individualized care**:

- **First-line therapy**: Lifestyle modification for all patients with PCOS [^112qQf35] [^111N8qV2].

- **Metformin use**: Recommended for adults with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m², or those with metabolic features, impaired glucose tolerance, or intolerance to COCPs [^111WRzTZ] [^116k5qxN].

- **Ovulation induction**: Letrozole is first-line; metformin may be used alone or with clomiphene in selected cases [^112YVDhs] [^114KMFar].

- **Pregnancy**: Metformin may be considered to reduce preterm birth and gestational weight gain, but long-term offspring effects are uncertain [^114He3Hn] [^114NxgEP].

---

## Specific patient populations benefiting from metformin

Certain subgroups benefit **more from metformin**:

- **Overweight/obese women**: Greater improvements in insulin sensitivity, weight, and metabolic parameters [^111WRzTZ] [^115cGrKh].

- **Women with insulin resistance**: Significant reductions in hyperinsulinemia and androgen levels [^114NxgEP] [^112YVDhs].

- **Adolescents**: Modest improvements in menstrual regularity and metabolic health; careful monitoring required [^111WRzTZ] [^115av4dT].

---

## Long-term outcomes and safety

Long-term, metformin is **generally safe**, with sustained metabolic benefits and no clear increase in major adverse events; however, vitamin B12 deficiency and gastrointestinal effects warrant monitoring, and long-term offspring effects from in utero exposure remain under study [^1174jRr1] [^111WRzTZ].

---

Metformin helps PCOS by **improving insulin sensitivity**, reducing hyperandrogenism, and enhancing menstrual regularity and ovulation, with modest weight and metabolic benefits. It is most useful in women with insulin resistance or obesity and is best used with lifestyle measures and, when needed, ovulation agents. Long-term safety is acceptable, but B12 monitoring and individualized risk–benefit discussions are essential.

Insulin sensitising agents

The pathophysiology of PCOS includes defective insulin secretion and function. Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are known to contribute to the high level of androgens in PCOS. Insulin helps to control ovarian function, and the ovaries are sensitive to high insulin levels. Theca cells produce high androgen as a response to excess insulin, which in turn contributes to the arrest of follicular maturation that predisposes to polycystic ovarian morphology, an indicator of PCOS. As well as its pivotal role in the pathology of PCOS, insulin resistance has a detrimental effect by predisposing PCOS patients to long-term health problems that including T2DM and CVD. Therefore, a therapeutic strategy to address insulin resistance, including pharmacotherapy and lifestyle intervention is crucial in the management of PCOS.

Thiazolidinediones

Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that is peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-γ) agonist. Pioglitazone principally acts by increasing peripheral glucose uptake, regulating adipogenesis and insulin action. Its effect in improving insulin resistance, hyperandrogenaemia and ovulatory dysfunction has been seen in women with PCOS. In a randomised control trial (RCT) investigating the effect of pioglitazone versus placebo in PCOS, pioglitazone resulted in significant reductions in fasting serum insulin and the free androgen index, whilst SHBG levels were increased. A meta-analysis comparing the effect of metformin and pioglitazone in treating PCOS reported a significant improvement in ovulation and menstrual cycle in the pioglitazone group. However, there was a marked increase in body mass index (BMI) score in the pioglitazone group compared with metformin. A randomised open-label study assessing the effect of pioglitazone, metformin and orlistat on mean insulin resistance (IR) and its biological variability in women with PCOS, reported a significant overall reduction in IR and IR variability. Despite the desirable effect of pioglitazone on the metabolic parameters in PCOS, there is considerable concern about the potential risk of myocardial damage, congestive heart failure and pulmonary oedema due to fluid retention. However, whilst the absolute risk is low in young women with PCOS, weight gain is a concern with thiazolidinediones in women with PCOS who are obese, and its use is an unlicensed indication.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^117MaXiA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Objective:

The aim was to formulate practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Participants:

An Endocrine Society-appointed Task Force of experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer developed the guideline.

Evidence:

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

Consensus Process:

One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Committees and members of The Endocrine Society and the European Society of Endocrinology reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of these guidelines. Two systematic reviews were conducted to summarize supporting evidence.

Conclusions:

We suggest using the Rotterdam criteria for diagnosing PCOS (presence of two of the following criteria: androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction, or polycystic ovaries). Establishing a diagnosis of PCOS is problematic in adolescents and menopausal women. Hyperandrogenism is central to the presentation in adolescents, whereas there is no consistent phenotype in postmenopausal women. Evaluation of women with PCOS should exclude alternate androgen-excess disorders and risk factors for endometrial cancer, mood disorders, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Hormonal contraceptives are the first-line management for menstrual abnormalities and hirsutism/acne in PCOS. Clomiphene is currently the first-line therapy for infertility; metformin is beneficial for metabolic/glycemic abnormalities and for improving menstrual irregularities, but it has limited or no benefit in treating hirsutism, acne, or infertility. Hormonal contraceptives and metformin are the treatment options in adolescents with PCOS. The role of weight loss in improving PCOS status per se is uncertain, but lifestyle intervention is beneficial in overweight/obese patients for other health benefits. Thiazolidinediones have an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio overall, and statins require further study.

### Descriptive review of the evidence for the use of metformin in polycystic ovary syndrome [^111bapNu]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Use of metformin in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is becoming increasingly accepted and widespread, but clinical practice is ahead of the evidence. Although a wide range of benefits in metabolic, reproductive, and clinical measures have been reported from non-randomised trials with metformin, close inspection of results from the adequately controlled studies shows that the benefits are modest. Our aim in this descriptive review is not to define practice guidelines but to improve clinicians' knowledge of the available published clinical evidence, concentrating on the few randomised controlled trials. We also highlight other issues, including hirsutism, acne, pregnancy, and neonatal outcome, that require more attention before clinical recommendations for the use of metformin in PCOS can be formalised. The potentially greater benefits achievable by lifestyle changes alone are also emphasised. We hope that the review will lead to more judicious use of metformin in PCOS and a more structured approach to research.

### Efficacy and safety of anti-androgens in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112c5kMa]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Anti-androgens and combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs) may mitigate hyperandrogenism-related symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, their efficacy and safety in PCOS remain unclear as previous reviews have focused on non-PCOS populations. To inform the 2023 International Evidence-based Guideline in PCOS, we conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the efficacy and safety of anti-androgens in the management of hormonal and clinical features of PCOS.

Methods

We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, All EBM reviews, and CINAHL up to 28th June 2023 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining oral anti-androgen use, alone or in combination with metformin, COCPs, lifestyle, or other interventions, in women of any age, with PCOS diagnosed by Rotterdam, National Institutes of Health or Androgen Excess & PCOS Society criteria, and using a form of contraception. Non-English studies and studies of less than 6 months duration or which used the same anti-androgen regimen in both/all groups were excluded in order to establish efficacy for the clinical outcomes of interest. Three authors screened articles against selection criteria and assessed risk of bias and quality using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) framework. Critical outcomes (prioritised during guideline development for GRADE purposes) included weight, body mass index (BMI), irregular cycles, hirsutism, liver function, and quality of life. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted where appropriate. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42022345640.

Findings

From 1660 studies identified in the search, 27 articles comprising 20 unique studies were included. Of these, 13 studies (n = 961) were pooled in meta-analysis. Seven studies had a high risk of bias, nine moderate and four low. Anti-androgens included finasteride, flutamide, spironolactone, or bicalutamide. In meta-analysis, anti-androgens + lifestyle were superior to metformin + lifestyle for hirsutism (weighted mean difference [WMD] [95% CI]: -1.59 [-3.06, -0.12], p = 0.03; I² = 74%), SHBG (7.70 nmol/l [0.75, 14.66], p = 0.03; I² = 0%), fasting insulin and fasting insulin: glucose ratio (-2.11 μU/ml [-3.97, -0.26], p = 0.03; I² = 0% and -1.12 [-1.44, -0.79], p < 0.0001, I² = 0%, respectively), but were not superior to placebo + lifestyle for hirsutism (-0.93, [-3.37, 1.51], p = 0.45; I² = 76%) or SHBG (9.72 nmol/l [-0.71, 20.14], p = 0.07; I² = 31%). Daily use was more effective for hirsutism than use every three days (-3.48 [-4.58, -2.39], p < 0.0001, I² = 1%), and resulted in lower androstenedione levels (-0.30 ng/ml [-0.50, -0.10], p = 0.004; I² = 0%). Combination treatment with anti-androgens + metformin + lifestyle resulted in lower testosterone compared with metformin + lifestyle (-0.29 nmol/l [-0.52, -0.06], p = 0.01; I² = 61%), but there were no differences in hirsutism when anti-androgens + metformin + lifestyle were compared with either anti-androgens + lifestyle or metformin + lifestyle. In limited meta-analyses (n = 2 trials), combining anti-androgens with COCP resulted in poorer lipid profiles compared with COCP ± placebo, with no differences in other outcomes.

Interpretation

Current evidence does not support the use of anti-androgens preferentially to COCPs to treat hyperandrogenism in PCOS. Anti-androgens could be considered to treat hirsutism in PCOS, where COCPs are contraindicated, poorly tolerated, or present a sub-optimal response after a minimum 6-month period, with consideration of clinical context and individual risk factors and characteristics.

### When should an insulin sensitizing agent be used in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome? [^111zj88q]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with insulin resistance and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. The attendant hyperinsulinaemia is also thought to contribute to the mechanism of anovulation in PCOS. Both metabolic and reproductive abnormalities are amplified by obesity and the treatment of first choice for overweight or obese women with PCOS is modification of diet and lifestyle. Nevertheless, changes in diet and exercise are, for many subjects, not easy to sustain and there seems an obvious place for insulin sensitizing agents in management of both reproductive and metabolic disturbances. Of the available agents affecting insulin sensitivity, metformin has been the most widely used but despite an enormous literature reporting beneficial effects on reproductive, cutaneous and metabolic manifestations of PCOS, its efficacy is unproven apart from in those subjects with impaired glucose tolerance or frank diabetes. Metformin at least has an assured safety record whereas both efficacy and safety of other insulin sensitizing agents in women of reproductive age, such as thiazolidinediones and glucagon-like peptide analogues, remains to be established.

### Drug insight: insulin-sensitizing drugs in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome – a reappraisal [^112kC13Q]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

The recognition that insulin resistance has a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) revolutionized our understanding of this complex disorder. PCOS causes major metabolic and reproductive morbidities, including substantially increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus and the metabolic syndrome. Insulin-sensitizing drugs (ISDs) ameliorate reproductive abnormalities, restore ovulation and regular menses, increase pregnancy rates and reduce androgenic symptoms in affected women with PCOS. Accordingly, ISDs, specifically metformin, have been widely adopted as therapy for this condition. A recent, large, randomized, multicenter, clinical trial that assessed live-birth rates rather than surrogate end points suggested that metformin alone is inferior to clomiphene citrate in treating infertility associated with PCOS. There is, furthermore, no evidence to support the use of metformin during pregnancy to prevent spontaneous abortions or gestational diabetes mellitus in women with PCOS. Renewed safety concerns about thiazolidinediones followed recent studies that reported increased cardiovascular morbidity with these agents. These concerns might preclude thiazolidinedione use in otherwise healthy women with PCOS. Finally, although ISDs improve insulin action and cardiovascular disease risk, there is no evidence that they provide long-term health benefits in PCOS. This article discusses the role of ISDs in PCOS in light of these new data.

### Metformin use in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): opportunities, benefits, and clinical challenges [^112ZdhHA]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

In this review, we explore the functions of metformin and provide a comprehensive synthesis of current evidence on metformin use in women with PCOS, including during pregnancy, examining its efficacy for a broad range of metabolic, hormonal, reproductive, and pregnancy outcomes. By critically evaluating the available literature, this review seeks to clarify the therapeutic utility of metformin as a management option in PCOS and to identify key knowledge gaps to inform future research.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^115fUtFh]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) infertility — general principles include that all fertility treatment in PCOS should be guided by the fertility treatment algorithm (Algorithm 2). Those with PCOS should be reassured that pregnancy can often be successfully achieved either naturally or with assistance. Prenatal vitamins supplementation should be commenced with ovulation induction therapy aligned to routine preconception care. Pregnancy should be excluded prior to ovulation induction therapy. The use of ovulation induction agents, including letrozole, metformin and clomiphene citrate, is off-label in many countries, and where off-label use of ovulation induction agents is allowed, healthcare professionals need to inform women and discuss the evidence, possible concerns, and side effects. There should be ongoing monitoring of patients for adverse effects, and infants for congenital anomalies, in all studies conducted with ovulation induction agents and these should be reported in any published papers.

### Role of metformin in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^114fAdto]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common endocrinological disorder affecting 4–12% of women and also the most controversial. Metformin was logically introduced to establish the extent to which hyperinsulinaemia influences the pathogenesis of the condition. Early studies were very encouraging. Randomized controlled studies and several metaanalyses have changed the picture and put the drug that was once heralded as magic in a much contracted place. More work is needed to establish its right place in particular with regards to the prevention of many gestational and long-term complications.

### Consensus on women's health aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): the amsterdam ESHRE / ASRM-sponsored 3rd PCOS consensus workshop group [^111Vnk1e]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Treatment with metformin in anovulatory PCOS — the use of metformin was found to have no benefit with respect to enhancing either fertility or live-birth rates, and its routine use is not recommended; a meta-analysis also showed no effect on miscarriage risk when metformin was administered before pregnancy. One small randomized controlled trial reported a reduced rate of severe pregnancy complications when metformin was taken through pregnancy, although a subsequent larger multicenter trial by the same group found no benefit in reducing pregnancy complications or altering fetal weight.

### Association of metformin with pregnancy outcomes in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome undergoing in vitro fertilization: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11714d9f]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), among the most common endocrinopathies associated with reproductive and metabolic disorders, affects 9% to 18% of women. According to the World Health Organization, PCOS belongs to group II of ovulation disorders and accounts for approximately 80% of women with anovulatory infertility. Stein and Leventhalfirst described PCOS in 1935, but it still presents dilemmas in reproductive medicine.

To date, the most widely accepted diagnostic criteria for PCOS is the Rotterdam criteria (2003), which require that women must meet 2 of the following items: oligo-ovulation or anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries. Additionally, other well-known disorders characterized by androgen excess should be excluded.

The heterogeneous manifestations of PCOS include infertility, obesity, inappropriate gonadotropin secretion (ie, elevated levels of circulating luteinizing hormone), pregnancy complications, cardiovascular disease, and psychological problems. In addition, metabolic features, especially insulin resistance with accompanying compensatory hyperinsulinemia, are common in women with this disorder. Given that a significant association between testosterone and insulin levels in PCOS has been observed, it is plausible that insulin resistance could play a role in the pathogenesis of PCOS.

Targeting insulin resistance has improved ovulation and fertility in women with PCOS. During the last decades, this recognition led to many studies regarding the possible role of insulin-sensitizing agents, particularly metformin, in the treatment of PCOS. Metformin, a biguanide that lowers blood glucose levels in individuals with hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes, is widely used among women with PCOS. The main pharmacologic action of metformin is to reduce the absorption of glucose from the gastrointestinal tract, inhibit the production of hepatic glucose, and increase insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in the periphery, but the underlying mechanisms of these actions remain unclear.

In the 1990s, a series of studies involving relatively small head-to-head trials (many uncontrolled) indicated that metformin could reduce insulin resistance, increase ovulation, and improve outcomes among women with PCOS undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles without, or sometimes with, clomiphene citrate or gonadotrophins. Nevertheless, the exact role of metformin in the management of PCOS is still controversial.

### Metformin lowers insulin resistance in PCOS patients… [^115p5DG2]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Insulin-sensitizing agents, such as metformin, decrease insulin levels and reduce ovarian hyperandrogenism in women with PCOS. Obese adolescents with PCOS are at high risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus because of severe insulin resistance and high circulating levels of insulin; however, metformin can reduce insulinemia and decrease FAH. Arslanian and associates studied the effect of three months of metformin treatment on glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and concentrations, and ACTH-stimulated adrenal androgen activity. Insulin concentrations dropped significantly, with evidence of improved hepatic insulin sensitivity. No significant change occurred in any lipid parameter. Total and free testosterone levels decreased significantly, and six patients reported improvement in menstrual cyclicity. Hormone response to ACTH stimulation was significantly reduced after treatment.

The authors conclude that in obese adolescents with PCOS and impaired glucose tolerance, metformin can improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, reduce insulinemia, and lower elevated androgen levels. The drop in the exaggerated adrenal response to ACTH stimulation with treatment may correct FAH. The side effects of three months of metformin treatment are minimal and easily tolerated. Further blinded, placebo-controlled studies are needed to confirm these effects of metformin. This study included some women who reported previous treatment with clomiphene citrate and some who did not. Forty-eight patients began taking metformin at a dosage of 500 mg twice daily for six weeks, and the dosage was increased to 500 mg three times daily if there was no ovulatory response. After six weeks on the highest dosage of metformin with no response, 50 mg per day of clomiphene citrate was added to the metformin regimen for a maximum of six cycles.

An ovulatory response occurred in 40 percent of patients with metformin alone, and 60 percent responded after the addition of low-dose clomiphene. After three months of treatment, 20 women conceived. Side effects of metformin were self-limiting, but 10 percent of patients had to reduce the dosage. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of metformin as a fertility drug. — r. s.

5 | DISCUSSION

The International Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS and the related translation program aims to provide clinicians with a quality, reliable source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide consistent clinical practice and to empower women with evidence-based information. All recommendations were formulated after an assessment of the best available evidence, multidisciplinary clinical expertise, consumer preferences and structured review by the five GDGs. Detailed methods for stakeholder engagement and guideline development can be found at. The guideline provides 166 recommendations: EBR = 31, CCR = 59, and CPP = 76. Overall evidence is low to moderate quality, requiring significant research expansion in this neglected, yet common condition.

We endorse the Rotterdam PCOS Diagnostic Criteria in adults (two of oligo- or anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound), after exclusion of related disorders. Where both oligo- or anovulation and hyperandrogenism are present, ultrasound is not necessary for diagnosis. In adolescents, both oligo-anovulation and hyperandrogenism are required, with ultrasound not recommended for diagnosis. Ultrasound criterions are refined with advancing technology. Antimüllerian hormone levels are not yet adequate for diagnosis of PCOS. Insulin resistance is recognized as a key feature of PCOS, yet clinical measurement is not recommended at the current time. Once diagnosed, assessment and management includes reproductive, metabolic, and psychological features. Education, self-empowerment, multidisciplinary care, and lifestyle intervention for prevention or management of excess weight are prioritized. Depressive and anxiety symptoms should be screened, assessed and managed and health professionals should be aware of other impacts on emotional wellbeing and quality of life. Combined oral contraceptive pills are first-line pharmacological management for menstrual irregularity and hyperandrogenism, with no specific formulation recommended and with low dose preparations preferred. Metformin is recommended in addition or alone, primarily for management of metabolic features. Letrozole is first-line pharmacological infertility therapy; with clomiphene and metformin both having a role alone and in combination. In women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility, gonadotrophins are second line. In the absence of an absolute indication for IVF, women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility, could be offered IVF third line where other ovulation induction therapies have failed.

### Metformin for polycystic ovary syndrome… [^1154Gk5q]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

From more than 90 articles on metformin and PCOS, the author identified 21 studies that reported clinical outcomes or significant aspects of the clinical pharmacology of met-formin related to PCOS. Metformin does not produce hypoglycemia but is thought to act on several cellular processes, including hepatic glucose production, intestinal absorption of glucose, gluconeogenesis, and the use of insulin-mediated glucose in peripheral tissues. In one large clinical trial of 3, 234 adults with elevated fasting and postglucose-load plasma glucose concentrations, metformin reduced the risk of progression to diabetes by 31 percent compared with placebo. Even greater reductions were achieved with the addition of aggressive lifestyle modifications. The author emphasizes the need for both lifestyle changes and metformin therapy to reduce the risk of diabetes in women with PCOS. 2 that is necessary for the return of ovulation.

In one study of 150 obese women, a 10 percent reduction in BMI was achieved with metformin therapy. In another study, metformin plus a low-calorie diet was superior to the low-calorie diet alone for weight loss in women with PCOS. The weight loss action of metformin appears to be caused by the reduction in insulin resistance as well as by appetite suppression. Metformin is the only antidiabetic agent associated with weight loss rather than weight gain and is, thus, particularly suitable for therapy in patients with PCOS. The effects of metformin on menstrual function and infertility may be caused by decreased insulin resistance and lowered testosterone levels. In a long-term study of 23 women with PCOS, one half of those treated with metformin resumed regular menstruation. The effect appears to increase with duration of treatment. Studies of women who were treated for at least six months report that more than 90 percent of women resumed regular menstruation. 12 absorption.

The author concludes that metformin in dosages of 1, 500 to 2, 550 mg per day addresses the major aspects of PCOS management and is expected to become more widely used to treat this syndrome. Because of the gastrointestinal side effects of metformin, the usual starting dosage is 500 mg taken with the largest meal of the day. If tolerated, the dosage is gradually increased to 500 mg with each meal. Clinical effect does not usually occur at dosages of less than 1, 000 mg per day, and the optimal effect may not be apparent for several months.

Pharmacological therapy in PCOS

There is currently no ideal medical PCOS therapy that fully reverses underlying hormonal disturbances and treats all clinical features. The OCP does improve hyperandrogenism and insulin sensitisers (primarily Metformin) reduce insulin resistance in PCOS. Generally, medical therapy is targeted to symptoms and should not be used as an alternative to lifestyle therapy in PCOS (Figure 2). Simple medical therapy is summarised in Appendix 2. The OCP has long been used in PCOS to induce regular cycles, protect the endometrium and treat hyperandrogenism. Mechanisms of action include a significant first pass hepatic effect, increasing production of hepatic proteins including sex hormone binding globulin. This reduces free circulating androgen levels, even with low dose OCPs. This important mechanism of antiandrogenic action does not occur with progestin alone or non-oral oestrogen containing contraceptive preparations. The OCP also reduces ovarian androgen production. There has been concerning data that the OCP can increase insulin resistance and worsen glucose tolerance. Studies are inadequate and data conflicting with more research needed, however consideration should be given to cardiometabolic effects of medical therapy and low dose OCP preparations may be a preferable alternative, with similar efficacy and reduced cardiometabolic effects.

Metformin has had an increasing role in PCOS management, improving clinical features (ovulation, cycle regulation, and potentially hirsutism) with positive cardiometabolic effects. It does not appear to induce weight loss, although based on studies in DM2 it may assist in preventing future weight gain. Based on International Diabetes Federation recommendations, metformin has a role in prevention of diabetes where lifestyle therapy is inadequate. Given the increased insulin resistance and high risk of DM2, this includes PCOS especially if other risk factors including excess weight, family history of DM2, metabolic syndrome or prediabetes exist. In infertility, the role of metformin remains controversial. It does reduce hyperstimulation in those on other fertility therapies, however more research here is important. When using metformin it is better tolerated if started at 500 mg of slow release daily and increased over weeks to months to reach 2 g daily. Lactic acidosis is a rare side effect in those with other significant illnesses including renal impairment. It is important to note that neither metformin nor the OCP are approved by most regulatory authorities specifically for PCOS. The OCP is indicated for contraception and metformin for the treatment of diabetes. However, both treatments are recommended by international and national endocrine societies and are evidence based. A detailed discussion of infertility therapy is beyond the scope of this review, however clomiphene is generally used as initial medical therapy.

### Metformin useful for treating PCOS in adolescents… [^115RK1cM]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common hormonal disorder in women that is characterized by excessive androgen and menstrual dysfunction. Originally believed to be a cosmetic and fertility problem, PCOS can increase risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. The cause of PCOS is not fully understood, but insulin resistance and hyper-insulinemia can increase androgen production in the ovaries and adrenal glands. Studies have found that weight loss and the use of insulin-sensitizing agents have improved clinical status and hyperinsulinemia, and reduced excessive androgens in women with the syndrome. However, these studies do not address PCOS in adolescents. Bridger and colleagues evaluated insulin-sensitizer use with healthy lifestyle counseling in adolescents with the disorder. The study included 22 adolescent women diagnosed with PCOS.

Participants had to be at least 12 years of age, have initiated menarche at least two years before the enrollment, and have no other cause for hyperinsulinemia or hyperandrogenism. Baseline data were collected before the study for height, weight, blood pressure, and hirsutism score. A baseline laboratory assessment also was performed and included a 75-g glucose tolerance test, with blood sugar and insulin measurements at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. Lipid panels and testosterone and progesterone levels were included in the first blood draw. Every adolescent participated in counseling, which included information about healthy eating and physical activity. Participants received metformin or placebo for 12 weeks, at which time the laboratory assessment was repeated. The metformin group had a significant reduction in mean serum testosterone levels compared with the placebo group and was 2. 5 times more likely to have menses.

Insulin sensitivity showed improvement in the metformin group, but it did not reach statistical significance. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels improved significantly in the metformin group, but there was no change in triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein, or total cholesterol levels. There also was no change in body mass index or hirsutism score at the end of the study. The authors conclude that metformin lowers testosterone levels and improves menstrual regularity in adolescent women with PCOS. They also note an improvement in HDL cholesterol but none in other lipid parameters. There is a trend toward improvement in insulin sensitivity in the metformin group, but long-term follow-up studies need to be performed to determine if it is significant.

### Metformin and combined oral contraceptive pills in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115ByaPV]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Context

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects more than 1 in 10 women.

Objective

As part of the 2023 International PCOS Guidelines update, comparisons between combined oral contraceptive pills (COCP), metformin, and combination treatment were evaluated.

Data Sources

Ovid Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, All EBM, and CINAHL were searched.

Study Selection

Women with PCOS included in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Data Extraction

We calculated mean differences and 95% CIs regarding anthropometrics, metabolic, and hyperandrogenic outcomes. Meta-analyses and quality assessment using GRADE were performed.

Data Synthesis

The search identified 1660 publications; 36 RCTs were included. For hirsutism, no differences were seen when comparing metformin vs COCP, nor when comparing COCP vs combination treatment with metformin and COCP. Metformin was inferior on free androgen index (FAI) (7.08; 95% CI 4.81, 9.36), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) (-118.61 nmol/L; 95% CI -174.46, -62.75) and testosterone (0.48 nmol/L; 95% CI 0.32, 0.64) compared with COCP. COCP was inferior for FAI (0.58; 95% CI 0.36, 0.80) and SHBG (-16.61 nmol/L; 95% CI -28.51, -4.71) compared with combination treatment, whereas testosterone did not differ. Metformin lowered insulin (-27.12 pmol/L; 95% CI -40.65, -13.59) and triglycerides (-0.15 mmol/L; 95% CI -0.29, -0.01) compared with COCP. COCP was inferior for insulin (17.03 pmol/L; 95% CI 7.79, 26.26) and insulin resistance (0.44; 95% CI 0.17, 0.70) compared with combination treatment.

Conclusions

The choice of metformin or COCP treatment should be based on symptoms, noting some biochemical benefits from combination treatment targeting both major endocrine disturbances seen in PCOS (hyperinsulinemia and hyperandrogenism).

### Effects of different insulin sensitisers in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112bgArJ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Characteristic features of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) include insulin resistance and an increased risk for type 2 diabetes. To promote improved insulin sensitivity, insulin sensitisers have been used in PCOS. However, direct comparisons across these agents are limited. This study compared the effects of metformin, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone in the management of PCOS to inform the 2023 International Evidence-based PCOS Guideline.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature.

Patients

Women with PCOS and treatment with insulin sensitisers.

Measurements

Hormonal and clinical outcomes, as well as side effects.

Results

Of 1660 publications identified, 13 randomised controlled trials were included. Metformin was superior in lowering weight (mean difference [MD]: -4.39, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -7.69 to -1.08kg), body mass index (MD: -0.95, 95% CI: -1.41 to -0.49kg/m 2) and testosterone (MD: -0.10, 95% CI: -0.18 to -0.03nmol/L) versus rosiglitazone, whereas there was no difference when comparing metformin to pioglitazone. Adding rosiglitazone or pioglitazone to metformin did not improve metabolic outcomes. However, rosiglitazone seemed superior to metformin in lowering lipid concentrations.

Conclusions

Metformin should remain the first-line insulin sensitising treatment in adults with PCOS for the prevention and management of weight and metabolic features. The addition of thiazolidinediones appears to offer little benefit.

### Contemporary approaches to the management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^111eTeoJ]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common disorder in women in their reproductive years and is characterized by androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovarian morphology. It is also associated with several metabolic abnormalities, particularly insulin resistance and obesity, which play an important role in the pathophysiology of PCOS and, in particular, negatively influence ovarian function and fertility. This review article summarizes the available treatment for women with PCOS. Specifically, current and potentially new therapies are discussed.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^111PxC7f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Letrozole is the preferred first line pharmacological infertility therapy, with clomiphene in combination with metformin; gonadotrophins or ovarian surgery primarily having a role as second line therapy. In vitro fertilization (IVF) could be offered, potentially with in vitro maturation, as third line therapy, where other ovulation induction therapies have failed and in the absence of an absolute indication for IVF in women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility. Given the underlying risk for pregnancy complications in PCOS, single embryo transfer should be preferred.

Overall, evidence in PCOS is low to moderate quality. Based on high prevalence and significant health impact, greater priority, education, models of care, funding, and research are recommended. Guideline translation will be extensive including multilingual education outputs and evidence-based resources for consumers (the ASKPCOS app), healthcare professionals and policy makers.

The guideline recommendations are protected under copyright, however a clear process for adaption of guideline recommendations to regional context is available by contacting the author for correspondence online. The translation program will be free and internationally accessible, building on the existing range of codesigned resources including the patient focused, evidence-based PCOS APP (AskPCOS), used in 186 countries and based on a rigorously developed question prompt list. Multi-faceted patient codesigned resources will aim to enhance health literacy with comprehensive PCOS-related health information available in multiple formats and in 15–20 languages. Internationally accessible resources include education modules for healthcare professionals at different career stages and disciplines, healthcare professional accredited courses, practice resources and tools, webinars with international expert panels, and e-health information resources that will be available online. Importantly, the Guideline and translation of the Guideline is expected to improve patient experiences through the provision of timely and accurate diagnosis, of accessible evidence-based information and of improved multi-disciplinary support. Ultimately, this international initiative may serve as an exemplar for large scale collaborative engagement, pooling of resources, avoidance of duplication and inconsistency with consensus-based statements, and codesign of best quality consistent guidelines with processes for local adaption and healthcare impact. Key elements include extensive collaboration, broad stakeholder representation, consumer partnership, distributive leadership, adequate funding, robust project management and governance, adherence to best practice and integrated comprehensive translation, and evaluation. We sincerely thank the partner and collaborating organizations, consumer groups and members of the GDGs for their substantive commitment to the international partnership to optimize health outcomes for women with this common, heterogeneous, and much neglected condition.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114sxcpZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim was to formulate practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Participants

An Endocrine Society-appointed Task Force of experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer developed the guideline.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

Consensus Process

One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Committees and members of The Endocrine Society and the European Society of Endocrinology reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of these guidelines. Two systematic reviews were conducted to summarize supporting evidence.

Conclusions

We suggest using the Rotterdam criteria for diagnosing PCOS (presence of two of the following criteria: androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction, or polycystic ovaries). Establishing a diagnosis of PCOS is problematic in adolescents and menopausal women. Hyperandrogenism is central to the presentation in adolescents, whereas there is no consistent phenotype in postmenopausal women. Evaluation of women with PCOS should exclude alternate androgen-excess disorders and risk factors for endometrial cancer, mood disorders, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Hormonal contraceptives are the first-line management for menstrual abnormalities and hirsutism/acne in PCOS. Clomiphene is currently the first-line therapy for infertility; metformin is beneficial for metabolic/glycemic abnormalities and for improving menstrual irregularities, but it has limited or no benefit in treating hirsutism, acne, or infertility. Hormonal contraceptives and metformin are the treatment options in adolescents with PCOS. The role of weight loss in improving PCOS status per se is uncertain, but lifestyle intervention is beneficial in overweight/obese patients for other health benefits. Thiazolidinediones have an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio overall, and statins require further study.

### Impact of metformin on the clinical and metabolic parameters of women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114hfiRJ]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Metformin is usually administered at a starting dose of 500 mg QD, increasing to the highest dose of 2000 mg QD if tolerated; sustained-release (SR) metformin is a preferred alternative for metformin intolerance. Although the duration of metformin treatment is unclear, the studies presented here were not less than 2 months with the longest being at over 7 years.

This study followed a comprehensive and systematic method to search for relevant databases and grey sources and only included RCTs. Steps were taken to minimise the risk of bias, and we excluded observational studies and non-randomised clinical trials. To the authors' knowledge, this review is the most comprehensive and up-to-date systematic review and meta-analysis on the effect of metformin in women with PCOS.

The limitations of this study include that the majority of the RCTs were small, and the statistical power used to calculate the sample size was not fully reported. Moreover, all trials were of short duration; therefore, the long-term effects of metformin in women with PCOS are not apparent.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — metformin in pregnancy is presented as follows: Metformin could be considered in some circumstances (e.g., risk for preterm birth) to reduce preterm delivery and limit excess gestational weight gain, in pregnant women with PCOS. Women should be counselled that the consequences of metformin exposure on long- term offspring health remain unclear and there is a suggestion of increased childhood weight, although causality is not certain. Side effects of metformin are mostly mild, transient gastrointestinal symptoms and are not worse in pregnancy.

### Metformin or oral contraceptives for adolescents with polycystic ovarian syndrome: a meta-analysis [^115av4dT]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common disease. There is limited evidence to support various treatment choices. This leads to variable treatment practices.

Objectives

To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the use of metformin versus oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for the treatment of PCOS in adolescents aged 11 to 19 years.

Data Sources

We performed literature searches through Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and gray literature resources, up to January 29, 2015.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Two reviewers screened titles and abstracts of identified citations, assessed full text eligibility, and extracted information from eligible trials.

Results

Four RCTs met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The reviewed evidence came from 170 patients. Overall, OCP treatment resulted in modest improvement in menstrual cycle frequency (weighted mean difference [WMD] = 0.27, P < .01, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.33 to -0.21) and mild reduction of acne scores (WMD = 0.3, P = .02, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.55). While metformin resulted in greater BMI reduction (WMD = -4.02, P < .01, 95% CI -5.23 to -2.81) it was associated with decreased dysglycemia prevalence (risk ratio: 0.41, P = .02, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.86) and improved total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels. Metformin and OCPs were similar in terms of impact on hirsutism.

Conclusions and Limitations

Current evidence is derived from very low to low quality evidence. Therefore, treatment choice should be guided by patient values and preferences while balancing potential side effects. Future high quality RCTs are needed to address several questions for the treatment of adolescents with PCOS.

3 METFORMIN: PHARMACOLOGY AND MECHANISMS

Metformin is a first‐line insulin sensitiser indicated for the management of T2D. As a synthetic biguanide chemically related to galegine (originating from the plant Galega officinalis), metformin is rapidly absorbed, with a half‐life of approximately 5–6 h, depending on the formulation (immediate or extended release). Unlike many pharmacotherapies, metformin is not bound to plasma proteins, bypasses hepatic metabolism, and is excreted intact in urine. While these properties minimise drug‐to‐drug interactions, metformin can accumulate in those with renal impairment, with a very rare complication being lactic acidosis.

The mechanisms of metformin action in PCOS are outlined in Figure 1. The key therapeutic effects of metformin involve reducing hepatic gluconeogenesis, enhancing peripheral glucose utilization, and increasing insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle or adipose tissue, without causing weight gain or hypoglycaemia. Metformin has also been recently shown to enhance the release of glucose from the blood into the intestinal tract. In line with this, high concentrations of metformin accumulate in the intestine — increasingly considered a primary site of metformin action — where it inhibits mitochondrial complex I, reduces NAD+ availability, and promotes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate in enterocytes. This intestinal lactate is then transported to the liver where it contributes to gluconeogenesis in a form of gut‐liver cross‐talk, promoting a splanchnic glucose–lactate–glucose cycle that may help regulate systemic glucose levels, despite its energetic inefficiency. These multifaceted properties have made metformin a cornerstone of therapy in the management of T2D, and increasingly in PCOS, particularly in women with metabolic features of PCOS. At a molecular level, metformin exerts its effects primarily via activation of the 5′ adenosine monophosphate‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) signalling pathway, but this does not account for all the reported actions of metformin as detailed elsewhere. Activation of AMPK suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis, enhances glucose uptake via glucose transporter‐4 (GLUT4) translocation, and promotes fatty acid oxidation by inhibiting acetyl‐CoA carboxylase (ACC). Additionally, activated AMPK inhibits nuclear factor kappa B signalling and inflammasome activation, thus improving vascular and endothelial function. AMPK‐independent mechanisms include inhibition of mitochondrial complex I, as noted above in the context of intestinal action. This inhibition also occurs in other tissues, particularly in the liver, where it reduces ATP production and alters cellular redox potential, thereby suppressing gluconeogenesis and improving glucose homeostasis. Metformin also modulates gut microbiota composition and promotes gut hormones including GLP‐1 and peptide YY (PYY) which mediate hunger and satiety. These actions can mitigate obesity and insulin resistance, features which are central to PCOS, and can reduce hyperinsulinemia‐driven hyperandrogenism, which contributes to ovulatory dysfunction and infertility. The complex, multiorgan effects of metformin are also potentially useful during pregnancy, a period marked by naturally heightened insulin resistance and altered pre‐prandial and post‐prandial glucose metabolism. The insulin‐sensitising, immunomodulating, and gut hormone‐regulating effects of metformin, and its protective effects against endothelial dysfunction, suggest a role in preventing adverse outcomes including excess GWG, GDM, macrosomia, and preeclampsia, often exacerbated in PCOS pregnancies.

### Effects of metformin withdrawal after long and short term treatment in PCOS: observational longitudinal study [^1157hd6P]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Metformin plays a consolidated role in management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It decreases hyperinsulinemia, hyperandrogenemia, improves menstrual cycles and pregnancy rates. Although these favorable effects are individually modest, they seem to be collectively sufficient to confer therapeutic benefits in metabolic and reproductive aspects of the syndrome. By reducing cardiovascular risk factors, metformin also has a promising position in prevention of cardiometabolic sequelae of PCOS, rated as 1.43-fold increased risk of coronary arterial disease, cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, angina, heart failure, and ischemic heart disease in reproductive age PCOS patients.

Treatment with metformin is well established for patients with PCOS and impaired glucose homeostasis or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), when lifestyle intervention (LSI) is insufficient and for management of menstrual irregularity if women are unable to take oral contraceptives. The latest international guidelines further advise a consideration of metformin as adjunct to LSI in adult women with PCOS with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m 2, regardless of the presence of glucose disturbances and menstrual irregularity, for management of weight and preventing or slowing progression to adverse cardiometabolic outcomes.

The evidence supporting these recommendations and current clinical practice are mainly provided from short term studies and meta-analysis designed from 3 up to 12 months. Long-term studies are very limited. The longest prospective study lasted 4 years and reported initial weight reduction in the first year followed by stabilization of weight along 4 years, particularly in women with BMI over 25 kg/m 2. At first year on metformin and diet, insulin resistance (IR) as assessed by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) was 33% lower than entry levels and remained the same for the following years. Furthermore, long-term treatment with metformin-diet appers to be antiatherogenic by virtue of reductions of LDL-C and increments in HDL-C. The longest 10 year-retrospective study demonstrated that metformin treatment of overweight-obese women with PCOS resulted in reduction and stabilization of weight, improvements of menstrual function and androgen profile and in low conversion rate to diabetes. However, less than 25% of patients remained adherent to metformin for more than 5 years with further dropout to only 6% of those still adherent to metformin at the 10th year of follow up.

Given the lack of long term data, it is not known whether metformin should be considered as a symptomatic or as a curative therapy. It is also not clear for how long metformin should be prescribed or whether there is any treatment legacy effects after its suspension.

### Evidence-based and potential benefits of metformin in the polycystic ovary syndrome: a comprehensive review [^113BbaM1]. Endocrine Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Metformin is an insulin sensitizer widely used for the treatment of patients affected by type 2 diabetes mellitus. Because many women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are insulin resistant, metformin was introduced in clinical practice to treat these patients also. Moreover, metformin's effect has other targets beside its insulin-sensitizing action. The present review was aimed at describing all evidence-based and potential uses of metformin in PCOS patients. In particular, we will analyze the uses of metformin not only for the treatment of all PCOS-related disturbances such as menstrual disorders, anovulatory infertility, increased abortion, or complicated pregnancy risk, hyperandrogenism, endometrial, metabolic and cardiovascular abnormalities, but also for the prevention of the syndrome.

To address these challenges and advance the field, high‐quality, well‐controlled, and adequately powered clinical trials conducted with long‐term follow‐up are now needed. Additionally, integrated analyses of individual patient data from RCTs are essential but, as yet, have not been conducted in the context of PCOS. In pregnancy, the Metformin in Pregnancy Study (MiPS)represents a key step toward outcome harmonization to evaluate maternal and offspring health, including in PCOS; however, broader consortia are needed to clarify the effects of metformin across different PCOS phenotypes, populations and life stages.

### A review of therapeutic options for managing the metabolic aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome [^114pjZzG]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

In women with PCOS, metformin is usually prescribed at starting doses of 500–850 mg daily and can be titrated up to 2000 mg/day if tolerated. Higher metformin doses have been beneficial in reducing weight and improving lipid profiles, particularly in obese PCOS population. There is also evidence of the development of vitamin B12 deficiency with long-term metformin use. – Therefore, due to metformin intolerance and its associated adverse events, it is important to consider other therapeutic options for the treatment of metformin intolerant women with PCOS.

3.4 Values and preferences

Taken together, the data in general populations and in our meta-analysis in women with PCOS support the role of lifestyle change for prevention and treatment of metabolic dysfunction. We found little evidence to support lifestyle change as an infertility treatment, although other reports and national guidelines have found a benefit. We attribute the failure to document additional benefits to the lack of well-designed studies in this area. Despite the relative lack of evidence that weight loss improves PCOS per se, we recommend lifestyle change in overweight and obese women with PCOS. There may also be some benefit in prevention of weight gain in women with PCOS who exercise regularly and eat sensibly.

Use of metformin in adults

3.5 We suggest against the use of metformin as a first-line treatment of cutaneous manifestations, for prevention of pregnancy complications, or for the treatment of obesity (2|⊕⊕○○).

3.6 We recommend metformin in women with PCOS who have T2DM or IGT who fail lifestyle modification (1|⊕⊕⊕○). For women with PCOS with menstrual irregularity who cannot take or do not tolerate HCs, we suggest metformin as second-line therapy (2|⊕⊕⊕○).

Quality Appraisal of the Evidence

Quality appraisal of the included studies, in terms of risk of bias (RoB), was performed by J.M. and M.F. using RoB2. Individual quality items included methods of randomization and group allocation; blinding of patients, carers, investigators, or outcome assessors; methods of outcome assessment and reporting; methods of data analysis; statistical issues; and trial pre-registration. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and re-inspection of the full-text article. Each study was adjudged as having an overall low RoB, some concerns, or high RoB. We used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) method to estimate the certainty of the evidence. GRADE assessments were conducted in duplicate by J.M. and M.F.

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers (J.M. and M.F.) extracted data from included studies, using a specially developed data extraction form according to selection criteria. Extracted data included a description of the study (authors, country, year of publication, setting, diagnostic criteria for PCOS), participants (mean age and BMI), intervention (dose and duration of metformin and COCP) and study results according to outcome. All units were recalculated to SI units and SD.

Statistical Analysis

Meta-analyses were performed using Review Manager 5.4.1. For continuous outcomes we calculated mean differences (MD) and 95% CI and for dichotomous outcomes odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI. Due to clinical heterogeneity from differences in metformin dose, type of COCP, and duration of treatment, random effects models were used for the meta-analyses.

We performed subgroup analyses according to BMI, age (adults and adolescents), and type of COCP. Regarding BMI, studies were sorted into 3 categories; those with participants with a BMI < 25 kg/m 2, those with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2, and studies using other BMI cutoffs (BMI not classified). Participants aged 10 to 19 years were classified as adolescents. Subgroup analyses according to type of COCP were classified into COCP containing CPA and other COCP.

Funnel plots were inspected for the assessment of publication bias.

It further states, "Good practice in PCOS and IVF is the use of a GnRH antagonist protocol as it gives the flexibility of using a GnRH agonist trigger, freeze all strategy to reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. However, if using a GnRH agonist long protocol then metformin could be considered". If metformin is used, "the following could be considered" including "Commence metformin at the start of GnRH agonist treatment", "Gradually titrate metformin up to a dose of between 1000mg to 2500mg daily in order to minimize side effects", and "Stopping metformin therapy at the time of the pregnancy test or pregnancy, unless the metformin therapy is otherwise indicated".

4.2 Systematic reviews and meta‐analyses in non‐pregnantpopulations

Several systematic reviews and meta‐analyses have evaluated the efficacy of metformin in PCOS compared with placebo or lifestyle, pharmacological agents, or alternative treatments (Table S1). A meta‐analysis of 32 RCTs found that metformin, alone or with lifestyle intervention, led to greater reductions in BMI and improvements in menstrual cycle duration and frequency compared with placebo, although no additional benefits were observed over lifestyle alone. Metformin also improved a range of hormonal and metabolic outcomes including total testosterone, fasting glucose, and lipid profiles, with greater benefit in those with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2. Two additional meta‐analyses examining metformin monotherapy (n = 18 and n = 14 RCTs) showed significant reductions in total testosterone, FAI, and AMH levels compared with placebo, with stronger effects observed in younger women or those with baseline AMH > 4.7 ng/mL. Cardiovascular improvements have also been reported, with a systematic review of 12 studies finding that metformin significantly improved endothelial function and carotid intima‐media thickness, suggesting a role in reducing early cardiovascular risk markers.

Consistent with primary data, pooled analyses have demonstrated further benefits with combination treatments. A systematic review of 16 RCTs showed that adding metformin to DPP‐4 inhibitors significantly improved glycemic control, while adding it to thiazolidinediones improved lipid profiles and adding it to GLP‐1 receptor agonists enhanced anthropometric outcomes, compared with metformin alone; however, hormonal effects were inconclusive. Moreover, a meta‐analysis of 8 RCTs found that GLP‐1 receptor agonists combined with metformin improved weight, BMI, waist circumference, HOMA‐IR, fasting glucose, and SHBG, without increasing adverse events. Building on this, two other meta‐analyses, each comprising 9 RCTs, compared exenatide (alone or with metformin) to metformin alone and reported greater reductions in weight, waist circumference, and FAI, along with improvements in SHBG and the Matsuda index, again with no increase in adverse events.

5 SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS

Based on the available evidence, metformin in PCOS is effective for improving insulin resistance, regulating menstrual cycles, and reducing androgen levels, with additional benefits for ovulation and some metabolic outcomes — particularly in women with elevated BMI or glucose intolerance. However, current data do not support the use of metformin as a first‐line therapy for weight loss, ovulation induction, or treatment of hyperandrogenic symptoms such as hirsutism or acne. These findings are broadly consistent with those of the 2023 International PCOS Guideline, which recommends metformin as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention in women with metabolic risk, and as a second‐line treatment in selected clinical scenarios including anovulatory infertility and impaired glucose tolerance.

For metformin use in PCOS pregnancies, both primary and pooled data suggest that metformin is generally safe and may reduce early pregnancy loss, late miscarriage, preterm delivery, excess GWG, and the need for insulin treatment in women with PCOS. However, findings related to GDM, PIH, and preeclampsia are inconsistent, likely due to heterogeneity in study designs, diagnostic criteria, and the inclusion of varying populations and treatments. Similar inconsistencies are seen across neonatal and offspring outcomes. Many meta‐analyses combine data from women with PCOS and metabolic comorbidities, such as GDM, which may confound the results and reduce applicability specifically to the PCOS population. Limited long‐term follow up and high attrition rates in long‐term studies further complicate interpretation. These limitations suggest caution when drawing conclusions and highlight the need for more rigorous, stratified analyses of integrated primary data (vs. aggregate‐level data) to clarify the efficacy of metformin in PCOS during pregnancy.

Key limitations across the PCOS literature include the notable variations in study populations, outcomes, diagnostic criteria, treatment targets and regimens, as well as methodological limitations, which collectively hinder interpretation and generalizability of findings. Baseline risk factors such as BMI, insulin resistance, ethnicity, family history, comorbidities, and the use of concomitant medications (e.g. anti‐hypertensives, thyroid hormones, antidepressants), as well as behavioural factors such as diet, physical activity, and breastfeeding, vary widely across studies and are often poorly controlled. Study design limitations — such as inadequate randomisation, blinding, dose inconsistency, poor adherence, and delayed metformin initiation — further affect the reliability of results. While systematic reviews have sought to integrate existing data generating larger cohorts, this inherent heterogeneity and the inability to explore confounders with aggregate data preclude meta‐analysis for certain outcomes and raise concerns around the accuracy of pooled estimates for others.

Other extensive meta‐analyses have been conducted examining fertility and ovulation outcomes in PCOS. The most recent is a technical report informing the 2023 International PCOS Guidelinewhich included meta‐analyses of 36 RCTs comparing metformin with placebo, CC, letrozole, and FSH. Metformin improved live birth, clinical pregnancy, and ovulation rates versus placebo. While metformin and CC were comparable for live birth, their combination outperformed CC alone in improving ovulation and live birth rates. Adding metformin to letrozole was superior to metformin plus CC, but not superior to letrozole alone, for clinical pregnancy and ovulation rates, although these findings were of low certainty due to high risk of bias. No benefit was seen for metformin plus FSH over FSH alone. Earlier meta‐analyses of 35 RCTs and 21 RCTs found similar results; one showed that metformin improved clinical pregnancy rates and reduced the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology compared with placebo or no treatment; and the other reported that metformin modestly improved clinical pregnancy rates compared with placebo (47.7% vs. 42.9%) in non‐obese women with PCOS, but had comparable efficacy to CC. While adding metformin to CC reduced miscarriage risk compared with placebo, it was associated with a higher miscarriage rate than CC alone and lower clinical and multiple pregnancy rates than letrozole. Additionally, a broader systematic review of 38 studies encompassing both pregnant and non‐pregnant women highlighted the potential role of metformin in restoring ovulatory cycles and enhancing pregnancy rates and outcomes compared with placebo or no treatment.

### A systematic review of the reproductive system effects of metformin in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome [^114CfMVi]. Fertility and Sterility (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the effectiveness of metformin in restoring regular menstrual cycles and ovulation and achieving pregnancy in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Design

Systematic review of pertinent studies identified using the bibliographic databases MEDLINE and EMBASE. References of selected articles identified were hand-searched for additional relevant citations.

Patient(S)

Women with PCOS undergoing treatment with metformin alone, metformin combined with other methods of ovulation induction such as clomiphene citrate (CC) or gonadotropin injections, or metformin combined with in vitro fertilization (IVF).

Result(S)

Thirty published studies were included in the overall review. Studies consisted of 12 randomized controlled trials, two cohort studies, and 16 uncontrolled descriptive studies. Due to a strong variability in the use of metformin according to study population, exposure, and outcome of interest, it was not possible to combine the data of the 12 randomized controlled trials to perform a meta-analysis. Limited data on predominately obese PCOS patients demonstrate that metformin alone improves both restoration of regular menses and spontaneous ovulation, but there are no data supporting an improvement in pregnancy rate. The addition of metformin to CC results in an improved ovulation and pregnancy rate in both unselected and CC-resistant PCOS women. There are insufficient data to make any conclusions on the effect of metformin on FSH ovulation induction or IVF.

Conclusion(S)

The effectiveness and role of metformin in the treatment of PCOS anovulatory infertility in clinical practice is difficult to assess from currently available research. Further well-designed prospective, perhaps multicenter, randomized controlled trials with the primary end point of pregnancy or live-birth rate are required.

Metformin — adults and adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): Metformin alone should be considered in adults with PCOS and a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 for anthropometric and metabolic outcomes including insulin resistance, glucose, and lipid profiles; metformin alone could be considered in adolescents at risk of or with PCOS for cycle regulation, acknowledging limited evidence; and metformin alone may be considered in adults with PCOS and BMI < 25 kg/ m2, acknowledging limited evidence. Where metformin is prescribed the following need to be considered: shared decision making needs to consider feasibility and effectiveness of active lifestyle intervention and women should be informed that metformin and active lifestyle intervention have similar efficacy; mild adverse effects, including gastrointestinal side-effects are generally dose dependent and self-limiting; starting at a low dose, with 500mg increments 1–2 weekly and extended-release preparations may minimize side effects and improve adherence; suggested maximum daily dose is 2.5 g in adults and 2g in adolescents; use appears safe long-term, based on use in other populations, however indications for ongoing requirement needs to be considered; and use may be associated with low vitamin B12 levels, where monitoring should be considered.

### Metformin use in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): opportunities, benefits, and clinical challenges [^115W1pxZ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Metformin, a synthetic biguanide, is widely used to manage type 2 diabetes, and is commonly prescribed in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) to address insulin resistance and associated metabolic and reproductive disturbances. PCOS is characterised by hormonal imbalances such as hyperandrogenism and anovulation, metabolic abnormalities including insulin resistance and increased cardiometabolic risk, and higher rates of pregnancy complications. However, the role of metformin in the multifaceted nature of PCOS remains debated. This review synthesises the mechanisms of action of metformin and its effects on metabolic, hormonal, reproductive, and pregnancy-related outcomes in PCOS. In non-pregnant women, metformin improves insulin resistance, menstrual regularity, and androgen levels, particularly in those with obesity or insulin resistance, and may enhance fertility when combined with other treatments. However, it is not effective as a first-line therapy for weight loss, ovulation induction, or treatment of clinical hyperandrogenic features, including hirsutism or acne. In pregnancy, metformin may reduce early pregnancy loss, miscarriage, and preterm birth, though findings for gestational diabetes and preeclampsia are inconsistent. Evidence is limited by study heterogeneity, varying diagnostic criteria, and the use of aggregate data in meta-analyses, all of which make interpretation challenging. Future research should prioritise well-powered clinical trials, individual patient data meta-analyses, and longer-term follow-up studies, particularly in pregnancy, to better define the populations most likely to benefit from metformin use across the PCOS spectrum. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition that affects up to 1 in 10 women of reproductive age. It is characterised by irregular or absent periods, signs of elevated male hormones (high androgens or excess hair growth), and/or polycystic ovaries seen on ultrasound. These features can lead to fertility problems, acne, psychological distress, and an increased risk of various disorders such as depression, type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Many women with PCOS also experience challenges during pregnancy, including a higher risk of miscarriage, preterm birth, and gestational diabetes. Metformin is a medication most often used to manage diabetes. In women with PCOS, it can help improve how the body responds to insulin, which may also reduce male hormone levels, improve menstrual cycles, and support fertility. This review examines the role of metformin in treating PCOS-both before and during pregnancy-by summarising key findings from the available evidence. In women who are not pregnant, metformin can help improve insulin resistance, hormone levels, and menstrual regularity, particularly among those who are overweight or have signs of insulin resistance. However, metformin alone is not a first-choice treatment for weight loss, ovulation problems, or symptoms such as acne and unwanted hair growth. When combined with other treatments, such as hormone therapy or fertility medications, it may offer additional benefits. During pregnancy, metformin is considered safe for use in women with PCOS and may lower the risk of early pregnancy loss and preterm birth. However, its effects on preventing gestational diabetes or high blood pressure are less clear, with mixed results across studies. Some research suggests that babies exposed to metformin in the womb may have slightly larger head sizes or a higher risk of being overweight in early childhood, but the long-term health effects remain unknown. Overall, metformin can be a helpful part of treatment for some women with PCOS, especially those with insulin resistance or certain pregnancy risks. Still, it is not a one-size-fits-all solution. More high-quality research is needed to better understand which women benefit most and to assess any long-term effects on children exposed to metformin during pregnancy.

4 EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: METFORMIN EFFICACY IN PCOS

4.1 Randomised controlled trials in non‐pregnantpopulations

Several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have assessed the efficacy of metformin (either alone or in combination with other treatments) in managing hormonal, reproductive, and metabolic features in adolescents and adults with PCOS (Table S1). However, its effects vary by treatment duration, metabolic profile, and individual characteristics. Below is a summary of findings from trials in general/mixed and selected PCOS populations.

4.1.1 General and mixedpopulations

Among general PCOS populations, metformin has demonstrated variable but frequently beneficial effects across metabolic, hormonal, and reproductive outcomes when compared with placebo, other pharmacological agents, or lifestyle and alternative treatments. Compared with placebo, short‐term trials (3–4 months; n = 29–40) using 1500 mg/day metformin reported reductions in luteinising hormone (LH), follicle‐stimulating hormone (FSH), blood pressure, fasting insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA‐IR), waist circumference, and testosterone, but no effects on other androgens or lipids. A three‐month trial (n = 118) examining bone parameters also found that using 1500–2000 mg/day metformin may reduce bone turnover by lowering markers of formation and resorption compared with placebo. Longer trials (6 months; n = 27–100) using metformin doses of 1500–1700 mg/day reported similar metabolic improvements, including improved lipid profile, insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, and testosterone compared with placebo, while AMH and adiponectin remained unchanged. In a 14‐month cross‐over study of women with PCOS and hirsutism (n = 16), metformin reduced weight and hair growth and improved cycle frequency compared with placebo, with no change in sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and free androgen index (FAI). One stratified trial (n = 116) reported phenotype‐specific effects, whereby 1700–2550 mg/day of metformin for 6 months reduced dehydroepiandrosterone‐sulphate (DHEA‐S) levels and improved hirsutism and ovulation in lean hyper‐ or normoinsulinemic women with PCOS; and reduced waist‐to‐hip ratio (WHR) and cycle duration in overweight or obese normoinsulinemic women, respectively.

### Does metformin improve clinical features of polycystic… [^113JNQh2]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Does metformin therapy improve the clinical features of polycystic ovary syndrome and increase the likelihood of ovulation. Cochrane Abstract Polycystic ovary syndrome is characterized by anovulation, hyperandrogenemia, and insulin resistance. Hyperinsulinemia is associated with an increase in cardiovascular risk and the development of diabetes mellitus. If insulin-sensitizing agents such as metformin are effective in treating features of polycystic ovary syndrome, they could have health benefits wider than simply treating the symptoms of the syndrome. Background. Meta-analysis showed that metformin is effective in achieving ovulation in women with polycystic ovary syndrome, with odds ratios of 3. 88 for metformin versus placebo and
4. 41 for metformin and clomiphene versus clomiphene alone.

Metformin is an effective treatment for anovulation in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Its choice as a first-line agent seems justified, and there is some evidence of benefit on parameters of the metabolic syndrome. Ovulation rates are higher when combined with clomiphene, but there is no evidence to indicate whether there is an increased multiple pregnancy rate with this combination. Evidence-Based Answer Metformin therapy improves fasting insulin levels and blood pressure. It has no clinically significant effect on body weight, waist: hip ratio, or LDL cholesterol level. Metformin, taken with or without clomiphene, appears to be an effective first-line agent for ovulation induction in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. The safety and efficacy of continuing metformin therapy during pregnancy has not been established.

Based on this review, advantages of metformin therapy for patients with polycystic ovary syndrome include clinically significant improvements in insulin resistance and blood pressure. Statistically significant lowering of LDL cholesterol levels was noted in patients taking metformin; however, the effect was too small to be clinically relevant. In addition, the reviewers found increased rates of ovulation in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome who were treated with metformin or metformin with clomiphene.

### The management of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome [^113icam2]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2014). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in women. The syndrome is typified by its heterogeneous presentation, which includes hirsutism (a function of hypersecretion of ovarian androgens), menstrual irregularity and infertility (that is due to infrequent or absent ovulation). Furthermore, PCOS predisposes patients to metabolic dysfunction and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aetiology of the syndrome has a major genetic component. Obesity exacerbates the insulin resistance that is a feature of PCOS in many women and amplifies the clinical and biochemical abnormalities. In clinical practice, the choice of investigations to be done depends mainly on the presenting symptoms. The approach to management is likewise dependent on the presenting complaint. Symptoms of androgen excess (hirsutism, acne and alopecia) require cosmetic measures, suppression of ovarian androgen function and anti-androgen therapy, alone or in combination. Ovulation rate is improved by diet and lifestyle intervention in overweight individuals but induction of ovulation by, in the first instance, anti-estrogens is usually required. Monitoring of glucose is important in overweight women and/or those with a family history of T2DM. Metformin is indicated for women with impaired glucose tolerance but whether this drug is otherwise useful in women with PCOS remains debatable.

Study Question

What is the recommended assessment and management of those with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), based on the best available evidence, clinical expertise, and consumer preference?

Summary Answer

International evidence-based guidelines address prioritized questions and outcomes and include 254 recommendations and practice points, to promote consistent, evidence-based care and improve the experience and health outcomes in PCOS.

What Is Known Already

The 2018 International PCOS Guideline was independently evaluated as high quality and integrated multidisciplinary and consumer perspectives from six continents; it is now used in 196 countries and is widely cited. It was based on best available, but generally very low to low quality, evidence. It applied robust methodological processes and addressed shared priorities. The guideline transitioned from consensus based to evidence-based diagnostic criteria and enhanced accuracy of diagnosis, whilst promoting consistency of care. However, diagnosis is still delayed, the needs of those with PCOS are not being adequately met, evidence quality was low and evidence-practice gaps persist.

Study Design, Size, Duration

The 2023 International Evidence-based Guideline update reengaged the 2018 network across professional societies and consumer organizations with multidisciplinary experts and women with PCOS directly involved at all stages. Extensive evidence synthesis was completed. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-II (AGREEII)-compliant processes were followed. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied across evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation and ultimately recommendation strength and diversity and inclusion were considered throughout.

Participants/ Materials, Setting, Methods

This summary should be read in conjunction with the full Guideline for detailed participants and methods. Governance included a six-continent international advisory and management committee, five guideline development groups, and paediatric, consumer, and translation committees. Extensive consumer engagement and guideline experts informed the update scope and priorities. Engaged international society-nominated panels included paediatrics, endocrinology, gynaecology, primary care, reproductive endocrinology, obstetrics, psychiatry, psychology, dietetics, exercise physiology, obesity care, public health and other experts, alongside consumers, project management, evidence synthesis, statisticians and translation experts. Thirty-nine professional and consumer organizations covering 71 countries engaged in the process. Twenty meetings and five face-to-face forums over 12 months addressed 58 prioritized clinical questions involving 52 systematic and 3 narrative reviews. Evidence-based recommendations were developed and approved via consensus across five guideline panels, modified based on international feedback and peer review, independently reviewed for methodological rigour, and approved by the Australian Government National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC).

Main Results and The Role Of Chance

The evidence in the assessment and management of PCOS has generally improved in the past five years, but remains of low to moderate quality. The technical evidence report and analyses (∼6000 pages) underpins 77 evidence-based and 54 consensus recommendations, with 123 practice points. Key updates include: i) further refinement of individual diagnostic criteria, a simplified diagnostic algorithm and inclusion of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels as an alternative to ultrasound in adults only; ii) strengthening recognition of broader features of PCOS including metabolic risk factors, cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, very high prevalence of psychological features, and high risk status for adverse outcomes during pregnancy; iii) emphasizing the poorly recognized, diverse burden of disease and the need for greater healthcare professional education, evidence-based patient information, improved models of care and shared decision making to improve patient experience, alongside greater research; iv) maintained emphasis on healthy lifestyle, emotional wellbeing and quality of life, with awareness and consideration of weight stigma; and v) emphasizing evidence-based medical therapy and cheaper and safer fertility management.

Limitations, Reasons For Caution

Overall, recommendations are strengthened and evidence is improved, but remain generally low to moderate quality. Significantly greater research is now needed in this neglected, yet common condition. Regional health system variation was considered and acknowledged, with a further process for guideline and translation resource adaptation provided.

3.5–3.6 Evidence

Metformin use has been suggested for a number of comorbidities in women with PCOS. Some of these have been discussed in other guidelines including hirsutism and treatment of cardiovascular risk factors in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and T2DM in patients at metabolic risk. We agree with the suggestion that metformin should not be used for hirsutism. Metformin studies have not been sufficiently powered to study acne. We agree with the recommendation that lifestyle management be considered first-line therapy for women with PCOS at increased metabolic risk.

Metformin has been associated with weight loss in some trials, but not in our meta-analysis. A systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that there was significant weight loss in trials using metformin compared with placebo in women with PCOS. The absolute weight lost was estimated to be 2.7 kg, equaling a 2.9% decrease in body weight, comparable to what occurs with orlistat treatment. However, metformin did not increase weight loss in patients using diet and exercise programs. Taken together, when weight loss and lifestyle modifications are used to treat obesity, there is no benefit to adding metformin. Therefore, diet and exercise, not metformin, should be the first line of therapy in obese women with PCOS. Metformin may remain a treatment consideration if the patient fails with diet and exercise.

One of the most important clinical outcomes demonstrated during metformin treatment was the improvement in menstrual cyclicity, leading to the possibility that metformin could be used to regulate menses. A systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated an improvement in ovulation rate in women taking metformin. It is unknown whether ovulation occurs at a rate that is adequate to protect against endometrial carcinoma. Trials directly comparing metformin with oral contraceptives demonstrate that metformin is not as effective as oral contraceptives for menstrual cycle regulation.

In patients with IGT, lifestyle modification with exercise and diet can decrease the progression to T2DM by 58% vs a 31% decrease with metformin. Furthermore, these benefits persist for up to 10 years after initiation, with lifestyle modification reducing diabetes incidence by 34% and metformin reducing it by 18%. However, intensive lifestyle modification, not metformin, was the only therapy that restored normal glucose tolerance in subjects with IGT. Similar trials in women with PCOS and IGT are too small and limited in duration to determine whether metformin prevented T2DM or caused regression to normal glucose tolerance. Metformin is recommended for prevention of diabetes in women with PCOS and IGT when lifestyle modification is not successful.

### Metformin increases fertility in patients with PCOS… [^117CQmTB]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical Question: Is metformin more effective than clomiphene for improving fertility in nonobese women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Setting: Outpatient Study Design: Randomized controlled trial. Allocation: Concealed Synopsis: Metformin and clomiphene have been used to increase fertility in women with PCOS. This is the first study to evaluate the medications head-to-head. One hundred women between 20 and 34 years of age with a body mass index lower than 30 kg per m 2 were randomly assigned to receive metformin 850 mg two times per day or clomiphene 150 mg three times per day. Each patient also received placebos of the opposite drug. Before starting the medications, the patients received a progesterone challenge, and medication was started on the third day of progesterone-induced menstruation. The main outcome, pregnancy rate, was assessed via intention to treat.

Five patients receiving metformin and three receiving clomiphene dropped out and were not included in the analysis. At the end of six months of treatment, 31 patients taking metformin became pregnant compared with 16 taking clomiphene. If all the patients lost to follow-up in the clomiphene group became pregnant and none of those taking metformin did, the pregnancy rate would still be significantly higher with metformin. Three women would need to be treated with metformin instead of clomiphene for six months for one additional woman to become pregnant. The rate of side effects was similar in each group, and one patient in each group dropped out because of side effects. Bottom Line: In nonobese women with PCOS, metformin is more effective than clomiphene for improving the rate of conception.

### Metformin use in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): opportunities, benefits, and clinical challenges [^1177QWCw]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Metformin, a synthetic biguanide, is widely used to manage type 2 diabetes, and is commonly prescribed in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) to address insulin resistance and associated metabolic and reproductive disturbances. PCOS is characterised by hormonal imbalances such as hyperandrogenism and anovulation, metabolic abnormalities including insulin resistance and increased cardiometabolic risk, and higher rates of pregnancy complications. However, the role of metformin in the multifaceted nature of PCOS remains debated. This review synthesises the mechanisms of action of metformin and its effects on metabolic, hormonal, reproductive, and pregnancy‐related outcomes in PCOS. In non‐pregnant women, metformin improves insulin resistance, menstrual regularity, and androgen levels, particularly in those with obesity or insulin resistance, and may enhance fertility when combined with other treatments. However, it is not effective as a first‐line therapy for weight loss, ovulation induction, or treatment of clinical hyperandrogenic features, including hirsutism or acne. In pregnancy, metformin may reduce early pregnancy loss, miscarriage, and preterm birth, though findings for gestational diabetes and preeclampsia are inconsistent. Evidence is limited by study heterogeneity, varying diagnostic criteria, and the use of aggregate data in meta‐analyses, all of which make interpretation challenging. Future research should prioritise well‐powered clinical trials, individual patient data meta‐analyses, and longer‐term follow‐up studies, particularly in pregnancy, to better define the populations most likely to benefit from metformin use across the PCOS spectrum.

Plain Language Summary

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition that affects up to 1 in 10 women of reproductive age. It is characterised by irregular or absent periods, signs of elevated male hormones (high androgens or excess hair growth), and/or polycystic ovaries seen on ultrasound. These features can lead to fertility problems, acne, psychological distress, and an increased risk of various disorders such as depression, type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Many women with PCOS also experience challenges during pregnancy, including a higher risk of miscarriage, preterm birth, and gestational diabetes.
Metformin is a medication most often used to manage diabetes. In women with PCOS, it can help improve how the body responds to insulin, which may also reduce male hormone levels, improve menstrual cycles, and support fertility. This review examines the role of metformin in treating PCOS — both before and during pregnancy — by summarising key findings from the available evidence.
In women who are not pregnant, metformin can help improve insulin resistance, hormone levels, and menstrual regularity, particularly among those who are overweight or have signs of insulin resistance. However, metformin alone is not a first‐choice treatment for weight loss, ovulation problems, or symptoms such as acne and unwanted hair growth. When combined with other treatments, such as hormone therapy or fertility medications, it may offer additional benefits.
During pregnancy, metformin is considered safe for use in women with PCOS and may lower the risk of early pregnancy loss and preterm birth. However, its effects on preventing gestational diabetes or high blood pressure are less clear, with mixed results across studies. Some research suggests that babies exposed to metformin in the womb may have slightly larger head sizes or a higher risk of being overweight in early childhood, but the long‐term health effects remain unknown.
Overall, metformin can be a helpful part of treatment for some women with PCOS, especially those with insulin resistance or certain pregnancy risks. Still, it is not a one‐size‐fits‐all solution. More high‐quality research is needed to better understand which women benefit most and to assess any long‐term effects on children exposed to metformin during pregnancy.

### A review of therapeutic options for managing the metabolic aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome [^112U3AEh]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age. Metabolic sequelae associated with PCOS range from insulin resistance to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Insulin resistance plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of PCOS and it is a reliable marker for cardiometabolic risk. Although insulin sensitising agents such as metformin have been traditionally used for managing metabolic aspects of PCOS, their efficacy is low in terms of weight reduction and cardiovascular risk reduction compared with newer agents such as incretin mimetics and SGLT2 inhibitors. With current pharmaceutical advances, potential therapeutic options have increased, giving patients and clinicians more choices. Incretin mimetics are a promising therapy with a unique metabolic target that could be used widely in the management of PCOS. Likewise, bariatric procedures have become less invasive and result in effective weight loss and the reversal of metabolic morbidities in some patients. Therefore, surgical treatment targeting weight loss becomes increasingly common in the management of obese women with PCOS. Newer emerging therapies, including twincretins, triple GLP-1 agonists, glucagon receptor antagonists and imeglemin, are promising therapeutic options for treating T2DM. Given the similarity of metabolic and pathological features between PCOS and T2DM and the variety of therapeutic options, there is the potential to widen our strategy for treating metabolic disorders in PCOS in parallel with current therapeutic advances. The review was conducted in line with the recommendations from the international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome 2018.

4.1.2 Overweight and Obesepopulations

In PCOS populations with overweight or obesity, metformin has demonstrated variable effects on metabolic and reproductive outcomes. In short‐term trials (3–6 months; n = 18–122), metformin at doses of 1000–2000 mg/day improved insulin resistance and reduced WHR, testosterone, free fatty acids, and total cholesterol when compared with EE‐CA or placebo. However, its effects on BMI, body composition, insulin, metabolic markers, and menstrual frequency were inconsistent. Some trials (n = 76–105) reported modest improvements over 6–12 months when metformin was combined with a hypocaloric diet, with or without flutamide, leading to reductions in BMI, waist and hip circumference, fasting glucose, insulin, and triglycerides. Yet, others (n = 38–122) found no significant changes in these outcomes after 6 months despite improved insulin resistance.

### Metformin and combined oral contraceptive pills in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112ufAmH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Results from this extensive systematic review and meta-analysis will advise the pending 2023 PCOS guideline update. The guideline will recommend COCP to be used over metformin for management of irregular cycles and hirsutism, and metformin over COCP for metabolic indications in PCOS. While our meta-analyses indicated that the combined treatment with metformin and COCP improved biochemical hyperandrogenism, insulin levels, and insulin resistance more than COCP alone, no difference was seen in clinical outcomes.

For women with PCOS, the choice of treatment should be based on clinical symptoms. Combination treatment appears to be beneficial in high metabolic risk groups, targeting the 2 major endocrine disturbances seen: hyperinsulinemia and hyperandrogenism. Our results, including several sub-analyses, add to the current evidence base and contribute toward reaching the ultimate goal of shared decision-making and effective, tailored, and individualized treatment for patients with PCOS.

Currently, treatment of PCOS in general populations is often symptom‐ and context‐dependent, but generally comprises lifestyle management as first‐line therapy, including diet modification and physical activity. Education and counselling around the chronic nature of the condition and psychological support are also vital aspects of management for women with PCOS. Pharmacotherapies are commonly used to manage PCOS, depending on individual needs and symptoms. Cosmetic light therapy, along with the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) is the recommended treatment for management of menstrual irregularities and hyperandrogenic symptoms such as hirsutism and acne, with anti‐androgens as second‐line pharmacological treatments when COCPs are contraindicated or poorly tolerated. For individuals seeking fertility treatment, ovulation‐induction agents such as letrozoleare recommended as first‐line therapy. For metabolic features of PCOS including obesity, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and dysglycemia, alongside lifestyle modification, metformin is recommended first line, and in some cases, glucagon‐like peptide 1 (GLP‐1) receptor agonists or metabolic surgery. Given the broad spectrum of symptoms and outcomes associated with PCOS, a tailored combination of lifestyle and pharmacological therapies is essential to improve quality of life and mitigate comorbidities in women with PCOS.

In pregnancy, however, the treatment of PCOS can present unique challenges. While lifestyle and/or weight management remain important and can improve pregnancy outcomes, the physiological demands of pregnancy, combined with the metabolic and endocrine disturbances characteristic of PCOS, often necessitate additional pharmacological support. However, pharmacological options used to manage PCOS in non‐pregnant individuals are unsuitable during pregnancy including the COCP and GLP‐1 receptor agonists (e.g. exenatide), due to contraindications and safety concerns. Anti‐androgens, including spironolactone and finasteride, are contraindicated due to teratogenicity. Similarly, thiazolidinediones, which can improve insulin sensitivity and metabolic features pre‐pregnancy, have raised concerns around growth restriction and teratogenicity, precluding their use in pregnancy. While metformin has been used in pregnancy for decades, and offers a potentially safe pharmacological option for managing metabolic disturbances in PCOS pregnancies, its efficacy and long‐term safety have been questioned. Potential benefits include preventing early pregnancy loss and limiting excess GWG in PCOS pregnancies, but there are conflicting reports regarding its efficacy for other outcomes such as GDM, preterm birth, and preeclampsia. Furthermore, concerns regarding its long‐term safety, particularly for offspring metabolic health, continue to fuel debate and contribute to inconsistent clinical recommendations around the use of metformin during pregnancy.

1 INTRODUCTION

Metformin is a widely used biguanide and insulin sensitizer with complex physiological actions that are yet to be fully elucidated. It is known that metformin enhances insulin sensitivity, facilitates receptor‐mediated intestinal and peripheral glucose uptake, and reduces gluconeogenesis. Collectively, these actions stabilize blood glucose levels and can limit ongoing weight gain with modest potential weight loss. With prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) as conditions driven by insulin resistance, impaired insulin secretion, or both, with resulting hyperglycemia, metformin is recommended in the prevention and management. Metformin is also recommended by International Evidence‐based Guidelines for the general management of metabolic symptoms in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a highly prevalent endocrine disorder that affects approximately 10–13% of women of reproductive age.

While metformin is a preferred pharmacotherapy for the management of T2DM and metabolic symptoms of PCOS, its use in pregnancy is more controversial. Here, indications include T2DM, PCOS, and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), the latter defined as hyperglycemia with first onset in pregnancy. Pre‐gestational diabetes and GDM currently affect 1–2% and 14% of pregnancies, respectively. While a detailed discussion of the efficacy and role of metformin in these conditions is beyond the scope of this review, indications in T2DM, PCOS, and GDMhave recently been reviewed elsewhere.

2 METHODS

We searched electronic databases including PubMed and Google Scholar to identify studies examining the use of metformin in women with PCOS. In addition, we manually checked the included studies in the reviews to ensure no relevant studies were missed. We included randomised controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta‐analyses examining the use of metformin in both pregnant and non‐pregnant women with PCOS. Studies with observational designs or without original data, and those not available in English, were excluded, as were studies in women without PCOS at study entry or who did not receive metformin as an intervention. The search was not systematic and is not intended to introduce new findings, but to provide a broad overview of the existing literature on metformin use in PCOS.

### Insulin-lowering agents in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^112pBJgB]. Endocrine Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a medical condition that has brought multiple specialists together. Gynecologists, endocrinologists, cardiologists, pediatricians, and dermatologists are all concerned with PCOS patients and share research data and design clinical trials to learn more about the syndrome. Insulin resistance is a common feature of PCOS and is more marked in obese women, suggesting that PCOS and obesity have a synergistic effect on the magnitude of the insulin disorder. Hyperinsulinemia associated with insulin resistance has been causally linked to all features of the syndrome, such as hyperandrogenism, reproductive disorders, acne, hirsutism, and metabolic disturbances. Women with PCOS should be evaluated for cardiovascular risk factors, such as lipid profile and blood pressure. Modification of diet and lifestyle should be suggested to those who are obese. Several insulin-lowering agents have been tested in the management of PCOS. In particular, metformin is the only drug currently in widespread clinical use for treatment of PCOS. In a high percentage of patients, treatment with metformin is followed by regularization of menstrual cycle, reduction in hyperandrogenism and in cardiovascular risk factors, and improvement in response to therapies for induction of ovulation.

### Use of metformin in polycystic ovary syndrome [^116WyY72]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have a myriad of phenotypic and clinical features that may guide therapeutic options for metabolic protection and ovulation induction. The use of metformin may prove beneficial in a subset of the population of women with PCOS. Hyperinsulinemia, as demonstrated by elevated insulin levels on a 2-hour 75-g load glucose tolerance test, is an important parameter in deciding whether or not to initiate metformin therapy to women with PCOS with the hope of preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Cardiovascular risk factors including markers of subclinical inflammation, and dyslipidemia may also be improved by metformin therapy. For ovulation induction, metformin is not as effective as clomiphene citrate as first-line therapy for women with PCOS. There are no clear data to suggest that metformin reduces pregnancy loss or improves pregnancy outcome in PCOS, and it is currently recommended that metformin be discontinued with the first positive pregnancy test result, unless there are other medical indications (eg, type 2 DM). This review addresses practical management guidelines for the uses of metformin in women with PCOS.

Pharmacological principles of treatment in PCOS

Recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of adolescents with PCOS include the use of the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) and/or metformin in those with a clear diagnosis or in adolescents deemed 'at risk' of PCOS for the management of symptoms. These recommendations were made following review of the evidence for the efficacy of COCP, metformin and antiandrogens alone or in combination for the management of hormonal or clinical PCOS features in adolescents and adult women with PCOS. These recommendations were also based on the need for interventions and longitudinal follow-up to address PCOS symptoms in adolescents who are 'at risk' but do not yet meet full diagnostic criteria. Whilst diagnosis is recommended where both irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism are present, when only one of these is detected, symptom reduction and future reassessment was deemed preferable to prematurely labelling or over-diagnosing an adolescent as having PCOS. This approach addressed the conundrum that healthcare professionals involved in the medical management of adolescent girls face in potentially over-diagnosing normal pubertal girls, girls with transient menstrual irregularities, or under-diagnosing girls who will likely evolve to a PCOS phenotype. Additionally, medications such as COCP are commonly prescribed in adolescents for contraception and other indications.

The following practice points should apply to all medications used in PCOS to inform adolescents and their families and to guide health professionals when considering or recommending pharmacotherapy: (1) an individual's personal characteristics, preferences and values are of importance when recommending pharmacotherapy; (2) the benefits, adverse effects and contraindications in PCOS and in general populations should be considered; and (3) the fact that COCPs, metformin and other pharmacological treatments are generally 'off-label' for the treatment of PCOS should be discussed where allowed, with adolescents and their families to consider the evidence and potential side effects for each option. However, off-label use is predominantly evidence based for other conditions and is allowed in many countries. Off-label prescribing occurs when a medication is prescribed for an indication, a route of administration, or a patient group that is not included in the approval product information document for that medication by the relevant regulatory body. Prescribing off-label is unavoidable and most commonly means that there has not been a submission to request evaluation of the indication or of that patient group for any given medication. The latter is very common in paediatric practice. Off-label use of metformin in adolescents with PCOS has been described.

Metformin

Metformin is a member of the biguanide family with proven safety and efficacy. Metformin has long been used in the management of T2DM and it is one of the insulin sensitising agents commonly used in the treatment of PCOS, though it is still an unlicensed indication in PCOS. The mechanism of action of metformin is through inhibition of hepatic glucose production, increased glucose uptake and increased insulin sensitivity in the peripheral tissues. The common side effects associated with metformin are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal bloating; however, the prevalence of these symptoms is variable, and the severity of the side effects can be reduced by titrating the dose guided by the severity of the symptoms, or by using modified-release preparations. Women with PCOS are at an increased risk of having prediabetes or T2DM. Despite this clear association, obesity sometimes confounds the link between PCOS and T2DM. Thus, prevention of T2DM in this cohort is crucial, and there is reliable evidence for the use of metformin to reduce the risk of T2DM in high-risk women with PCOS. In a study comparing metformin and lifestyle intervention in women with PCOS, a significant reduction in BMI was observed in both groups; however, reduction in androgen levels was only seen in the metformin group. In an RCT of obese and morbidly obese women with PCOS assessing the effect of metformin on body weight, a significant decrease in BMI independent of lifestyle modification was reported. In a study of 3234 non-diabetic participants with elevated fasting plasma glucose randomised to either metformin or lifestyle intervention with a mean follow up nearly 3 years, lifestyle changes reduced the new incidence of T2DM by almost 60%. In contrast, metformin reduced it by just over 30%; however, this effect was lost entirely following the washout period. This was further confirmed in a similar study where the impact of metformin no longer existed after 12 months of withdrawal. Women with PCOS are also at an increased risk of CVD owing to the hyperinsulinemia, high androgen levels, obesity and dyslipidaemia. There is evidence that obesity and PCOS independently affect vascular endothelial function; however, the association between high insulin levels and CVD is independent of obesity. Women with PCOS have worse lipid profiles compared with the healthy population and they typically have low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and high triglyceride levels that are both strong predictors of CVD. Thus, the management of dyslipidaemia is crucial in PCOS. Metformin improves dyslipidaemia by either a direct effect on the hepatic metabolism of free fatty acids or indirectly by reducing hyperinsulinemia. Many studies have reported that metformin has a significant impact on dyslipidaemia;, however, there was no beneficial effect of metformin on total cholesterol levels.

### Role of metformin for ovulation induction in infertile patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): a guideline [^111nYUPi]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Low credibility.

Metformin alone compared with placebo increases the ovulation rate in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) but should not be used as first-line therapy for anovulation because oral ovulation induction agents such as clomiphene citrate or letrozole alone are much more effective in increasing ovulation, pregnancy, and live-birth rates in women with PCOS. There is fair evidence that metformin alone does not increase rates of miscarriage when stopped at the initiation of pregnancy and insufficient evidence that metformin in combination with other agents used to induce ovulation increases live-birth rates.

### Effect of the combined oral contraceptive pill and / or metformin in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review with meta-analyses [^114GNNXz]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has a prevalence of 8%-13%. Given the prevalence, diverse health impacts and variation in care, rigorous evidence-based guidelines are needed in PCOS management. This systematic review with meta-analyses aimed to investigate the effect of the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) and/or metformin in the management of hormonal and clinical features of PCOS, to inform international guidelines.

Methods

Electronic databases were searched systematically from inception until 11 January 2017 to inform the guideline process. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials which investigated the effect of COCPs and/or metformin alone or combined on hormonal and clinical features in women with PCOS. Outcomes were prioritized as critical for informing a decision about an intervention or important or not important, according to GRADE. Articles were assessed by one author against selection criteria, in consultation with a second author. Data were double extracted independently by four authors, and data quality appraisal was completed. Meta-analyses were conducted, where appropriate.

Results

Fifty-six studies were eligible for inclusion. Outcomes prioritized by women and health professionals included the following: irregular cycles, insulin resistance, weight, BMI, thromboembolic events and gastrointestinal effects. In low-quality evidence in adolescents, meta-analyses demonstrated that metformin was better than COCP for BMI (mean difference [MD] -4.02 [-5.23, -2.81], P < 0.001); COCP was better than metformin for menstrual regulation (MD -0.19 [-0.25, -0.13], P < 0.00001). In low-quality evidence in adults, meta-analyses demonstrated that metformin was better than placebo for BMI (MD -0.48 [-0.94, -0.02], P = 0.04); metformin was better than COCP for fasting insulin (MD 4.00 [2.59, 5.41], P = 0.00001), whereas COCP was better than metformin for irregular cycles (MD 12.49 [1.34, 116.62], P = 0.03). Combined oral contraceptive pill alone was better than the combination with an anti-androgen for BMI (MD -3.04 [-5.45, -0.64], P = 0.01). Metformin was associated with generally mild gastrointestinal adverse events. Differences in statistical significance were observed when outcomes were subgrouped by BMI.

Conclusions

This review identified that COCP therapy has benefits for management of hyperandrogenism and menstrual regulation. Metformin combined with the COCP may be useful for management of metabolic features. There is minimal evidence of benefits of adding an anti-androgen to COCP therapy. Metformin alone has benefits for adult women for management of weight, hormonal and metabolic outcomes, especially for women with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2. There is inadequate evidence to suggest the optimal COCP formulation, or dosing regimen and formulation of metformin.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) inositol — position relative to metformin and implementation states: Inositol (in any form) could be considered in women with PCOS based on individual preferences and values, noting limited harm, potential for improvement in metabolic measures, yet with limited clinical benefits including in ovulation, hirsutism or weight; metformin should be considered over inositol for hirsutism and central adiposity, noting that metformin has more gastrointestinal side effects than inositol; women taking inositol and other complementary therapies are encouraged to advise their healthcare professional; specific types, doses or combinations of inositol cannot currently be recommended in adults and adolescents with PCOS, due to a lack of quality evidence; shared decision making should include discussion that regulatory status and quality control of inositol in any form can differ from those for pharmacological products and doses and qualities may vary; and policy makers and healthcare professionals have a responsibility to ensure women have access to unconflicted, evidence-based information to inform shared-decision making, whilst also acknowledging and respecting individual values and preferences, including for complementary therapies.

Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) — diagnostic definitions and treatment guidance include the following: "Of the three definitions of PCOS, the one suggested by NIH, as well as the definition put forward by the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society, includes the presence of hyperandrogenism as a required criterion", whereas "the Rotterdam definition… allows for several possible phenotypes, being defined by two of three of the following criteria: menstrual irregularity, polycystic ovaries on ultrasound and hyperandrogenism. Thus, it is possible for PCOS to be diagnosed in the absence of documented hyperandrogenism". For management, "prior to initiation of any intervention, emphasis should be given to the importance of lifestyle management, especially weight reduction", and "the recommended first-line treatment for ovulation induction remains the anti-estrogen clomifene citrate (CC)". "The use of aromatase inhibitors for ovulation induction seems to be as effective as CC, but insufficient evidence is currently available on its efficacy and safety", while "Metformin alone is less effective than CC", and adding metformin to CC "should be restricted to women with glucose intolerance"; accordingly, "the routine use of this drug in ovulation induction is not recommended". If ovulation fails or no pregnancy occurs, "the proposed second-line intervention includes either exogenous gonadotropins or laparoscopic ovarian surgery (LOS)", with exogenous gonadotropins "associated with increased chances for multiple pregnancies" requiring "careful monitoring of ovarian response".

3.5–3.6 Values and preferences

The committee believes that a priority should be placed on effective treatment. Although the preferred treatment for prevention of T2DM is diet and lifestyle modification, there are a significant number of women who will fail this option. Although metformin treatment incurs expense and has the potential for side effects, the committee feels that metformin may provide an option for treatment of IGT in those women who fail lifestyle management.

Treatment of infertility

3.7 We recommend clomiphene citrate (or comparable estrogen modulators such as letrozole) as the first-line treatment of anovulatory infertility in women with PCOS (1|⊕⊕⊕○).

3.8 We suggest the use of metformin as an adjuvant therapy for infertility to prevent OHSS in women with PCOS undergoing IVF (2|⊕⊕○○).

3.7–3.8 Evidence

Clomiphene and metformin have been studied extensively for infertility in PCOS with multiple large multicenter trials. In almost all of these, clomiphene has had improved pregnancy rates vs metformin, as well as providing comparable rates to injectable gonadotropins. A recent meta-analysis of insulin sensitizers for the treatment of infertility in PCOS concluded that "the use of metformin for improving reproductive outcomes in women with PCOS appears to be limited". In this review, there was no evidence that metformin improved live birth rates, whether it was used alone (pooled OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.16–6.39) or in combination with clomiphene (pooled OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.75–1.47). Metformin has been recommended for use in infertility treatment partly because it is thought to be associated with monofollicular ovulation and lower multiple pregnancy rates. None of the trials have been adequately powered to detect differences in multiple pregnancy rates, although multiple pregnancies with metformin have been rare in these trials (≤ 5%) and more common (around 5%) with clomiphene. The benefit of multiple pregnancy reduction must be balanced against the substantially lower pregnancy rates and lower fecundity per ovulation with metformin alone.

### Metformin in polycystic ovary syndrome: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114N54Uq]. BMJ (2003). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess the effectiveness of metformin in improving clinical and biochemical features of polycystic ovary syndrome.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Randomised controlled trials that investigated the effect of metformin compared with either placebo or no treatment, or compared with an ovulation induction agent.

Selection Of Studies

13 trials were included for analysis, including 543 women with polycystic ovary syndrome that was defined by using biochemical or ultrasound evidence.

Main Outcome Measure

Pregnancy and ovulation rates. Secondary outcomes of clinical and biochemical features of polycystic ovary syndrome.

Results

Meta-analysis showed that metformin is effective in achieving ovulation in women with polycystic ovary syndrome, with odds ratios of 3.88 (95% confidence interval 2.25 to 6.69) for metformin compared with placebo and 4.41 (2.37 to 8.22) for metformin and clomifene compared with clomifene alone. An analysis of pregnancy rates shows a significant treatment effect for metformin and clomifene (odds ratio 4.40, 1.96 to 9.85). Metformin has an effect in reducing fasting insulin concentrations, blood pressure, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol. We found no evidence of any effect on body mass index or waist:hip ratio. Metformin was associated with a higher incidence of nausea, vomiting, and other gastrointestinal disturbance.

Conclusions

Metformin is an effective treatment for anovulation in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Its choice as a first line agent seems justified, and there is some evidence of benefit on variables of the metabolic syndrome. No data are available regarding the safety of metformin in long term use in young women and only limited data on its safety in early pregnancy. It should be used as an adjuvant to general lifestyle improvements and not as a replacement for increased exercise and improved diet.

### Metformin use in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): opportunities, benefits, and clinical challenges [^114NxgEP]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

6 CONCLUSIONS

Metformin improves insulin resistance, menstrual regularity, and androgen levels in women with PCOS, particularly among those with obesity or insulin resistance. It may also support fertility and pregnancy outcomes when combined with other therapies. However, current evidence does not support the use of metformin as a first‐line therapy for weight loss, ovulation induction, or treatment of hyperandrogenic symptoms such as hirsutism or acne. Metformin use in pregnancy is generally safe and may reduce pregnancy loss and preterm birth, but long‐term offspring impacts remain unclear, suggesting targeted rather than routine use. Meta‐analyses using harmonized individual‐level data from RCTs are an important next step to advancing research in this area, with the potential to uncover critical insights and identify PCOS subgroups who may benefit from metformin use both in and outside of pregnancy.

Role of exercise in lifestyle therapy

3.3 We suggest the use of exercise therapy in the management of overweight and obesity in PCOS (2|⊕⊕○○). Although there are no large randomized trials of exercise in PCOS, exercise therapy, alone or in combination with dietary intervention, improves weight loss and reduces cardiovascular risk factors and diabetes risk in the general population.

Role of weight loss in lifestyle therapy

3.4 We suggest that weight loss strategies begin with calorie-restricted diets (with no evidence that one type of diet is superior) for adolescents and women with PCOS who are overweight or obese (2|⊕⊕○○). Weight loss is likely beneficial for both reproductive and metabolic dysfunction in this setting. Weight loss is likely insufficient as a treatment for PCOS in normal-weight women.

Use of metformin

3.5 We suggest against the use of metformin as a first-line treatment of cutaneous manifestations, for prevention of pregnancy complications, or for the treatment of obesity (2|⊕⊕○○).

3.6 We recommend metformin in women with PCOS who have T2DM or IGT who fail lifestyle modification (1|⊕⊕⊕○). For women with PCOS with menstrual irregularity who cannot take or do not tolerate HCs, we suggest metformin as second-line therapy (2|⊕⊕⊕○).

Treatment of infertility

3.7 We recommend clomiphene citrate (or comparable estrogen modulators such as letrozole) as the first-line treatment of anovulatory infertility in women with PCOS (1|⊕⊕⊕○).

3.8 We suggest the use of metformin as an adjuvant therapy for infertility to prevent ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in women with PCOS undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) (2|⊕⊕○○).

Use of other drugs

3.9 We recommend against the use of insulin sensitizers, such as inositols (due to lack of benefit) or thiazolidinediones (given safety concerns), for the treatment of PCOS (1|⊕⊕⊕○).

3.10 We suggest against the use of statins for treatment of hyperandrogenism and anovulation in PCOS until additional studies demonstrate a favorable risk-benefit ratio (2|⊕⊕○○). However, we suggest statins in women with PCOS who meet current indications for statin therapy (2|⊕⊕○○).

### A review of therapeutic options for managing the metabolic aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome [^113JbPEF]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age. Metabolic sequelae associated with PCOS range from insulin resistance to type2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Insulin resistance plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of PCOS and it is a reliable marker for cardiometabolic risk. Although insulin sensitising agents such as metformin have been traditionally used for managing metabolic aspects of PCOS, their efficacy is low in terms of weight reduction and cardiovascular risk reduction compared with newer agents such as incretin mimetics and SGLT2 inhibitors. With current pharmaceutical advances, potential therapeutic options have increased, giving patients and clinicians more choices. Incretin mimetics are a promising therapy with a unique metabolic target that could be used widely in the management of PCOS. Likewise, bariatric procedures have become less invasive and result in effective weight loss and the reversal of metabolic morbidities in some patients. Therefore, surgical treatment targeting weight loss becomes increasingly common in the management of obese women with PCOS. Newer emerging therapies, including twincretins, triple GLP-1 agonists, glucagon receptor antagonists and imeglemin, are promising therapeutic options for treating T2DM. Given the similarity of metabolic and pathological features between PCOS and T2DM and the variety of therapeutic options, there is the potential to widen our strategy for treating metabolic disorders in PCOS in parallel with current therapeutic advances. The review was conducted in line with the recommendations from the international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome 2018.

### Metformin and combined oral contraceptive pills in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Xm6PW]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

This review presents the most up-to-date evidence on COCP and metformin treatment in women with PCOS. Strengths of the report include the rigorous processes, including PICO developed by clinicians, researchers, and patients; and the large number of RCTs included. Because critical appraisal is inherently subjective, both RoB and GRADE assessments were conducted by 2 authors independently. Several subgroup analyses were included to highlight benefits in population subgroups of interest. Limitations include those inherent in the included studies, with many studies having a high RoB, mainly due to often poorly described randomization processes or lack of blinding. Certainty of evidence was also affected by inconsistency of effect sizes and small sample sizes. Several studies did not provide data on BMI.

Identified research gaps include the lack of larger studies on adolescents with PCOS and on the comparison of metformin with combination treatment. Additional high-quality studies are needed to assess symptoms, especially related to clinical hyperandrogenism rather than biochemical markers of hyperandrogenism. Future directions include understanding mechanisms of action and factors that may impact on medication responses, such as genotype and phenotype of PCOS.

### Impact of metformin on the clinical and metabolic parameters of women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^117Adnee]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review has outlined the up-to-date evidence supporting metformin's effectiveness in managing PCOS. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive systematic review to report the effects of metformin on anthropometric outcomes, insulin resistance indices, lipid profiles and CRP, androgen hormones and fertility outcomes of women with PCOS. When metformin was administered at various therapeutic doses and compared with placebo, there were statistically significant reductions in mean body weight, BMI, WC, fasting blood glucose, total testosterone, 17-OHP and LDL-C, and an increase in the pregnancy rate in women with PCOS. However, we should acknowledge that metformin is not a fertility drug such as clomiphene citrate (CC); it indirectly induces ovulation by reducing the insulin level and is less effective in ovulation induction than CC. However, CC acts directly by inhibiting the negative feedback on HPO-axis and induces ovulation. However, using metformin as an add-on therapy to CC significantly increases ovulation and the pregnancy rate in PCOS. These findings are in line with the findings of previous studies. Legro et al. in an RCT of 626 infertile women with PCOS, participants were randomised to receive metformin plus placebo, CC plus placebo, or the combination for 6 months. There was a high pregnancy rate and live birth rate with CC than with metformin. In an RCT of obese women with PCOS evaluating the effect of metformin on body weight, a significant decrease in BMI independent of lifestyle changes was reported. Women with PCOS are also at a higher risk of developing CVD due to hyperinsulinemia, high androgen levels, obesity and dyslipidaemia. There is evidence that obesity and PCOS independently affect the vascular endothelial function, however, the associations between hyperinsulinemia and CVD are independent of body weight. Women with PCOS also have dyslipidaemia, manifested as a low HDL and high triglyceride levels, a strong CVD predictor of CVD. Thus, the management of dyslipidaemia is crucial in PCOS. Metformin improves dyslipidaemia by directly affecting the hepatic metabolism of free fatty acids or indirectly by reducing hyperinsulinemia by enhancing the insulin senseitivty; however, there was no beneficial effect of metformin on total cholesterol levels. A recent network meta-analysis of 101 RCTs assessed the effects of 55 interventions in obese women with PCOS and found superior efficacy for flutamide and cyproterone acetate on hormonal and metabolic paratmeters.

### Impact of metformin on the clinical and metabolic parameters of women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114ykfim]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous endocrine condition that affects women of reproductive age, with a prevalence of up to 20%.PCOS is characterised by biochemical and clinical features of excess androgen, menstrual irregularities and polycystic ovarian morphology. In PCOS, high insulin contributes to excess ovarian androgen production, and insulin enhances steroid hormone release in the ovaries. High androgen levels are the drive for hirsutism and reduced fertility levels in women with PCOS. Women with PCOS have a significantly higher rate of impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In addition, nearly 70% of women with PCOS will develop the metabolic syndrome (MS), characterised by the constellation of dyslipidaemia, central adiposity, hypertension and impaired glucose tolerance, all predisposing factors to coronary heart disease and diabetes. A therapeutic approach targeting weight loss and improving insulin resistance is the cornerstone in managing PCOS and preventing its related complications, however, significant weight loss is still challenging in PCOS. Lifestyle intervention is the first-line therapy causing significant though minimal weight reduction. Pharmacological options for managing PCOS exist; however, their actual impact in clinical practice is still relatively unexplored. Metformin is a member of the biguanide family primarily used to manage T2DM. Metformin is also widely used in managing women with PCOS; it reduces androgen levels by improving insulin sensitivity and reducing the cardiometabolic risks associated with hyperinsulinemia in PCOS.

Abstract

Context

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects more than 1 in 10 women.

Objective

As part of the 2023 International PCOS Guidelines update, comparisons between combined oral contraceptive pills (COCP), metformin, and combination treatment were evaluated.

Data Sources

Ovid Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, All EBM, and CINAHL were searched.

Study Selection

Women with PCOS included in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Data Extraction

We calculated mean differences and 95% CIs regarding anthropometrics, metabolic, and hyperandrogenic outcomes. Meta-analyses and quality assessment using GRADE were performed.

Data Synthesis

The search identified 1660 publications; 36 RCTs were included. For hirsutism, no differences were seen when comparing metformin vs COCP, nor when comparing COCP vs combination treatment with metformin and COCP. Metformin was inferior on free androgen index (FAI) (7.08; 95% CI 4.81, 9.36), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) (−118.61 nmol/L; 95% CI −174.46, −62.75) and testosterone (0.48 nmol/L; 95% CI 0.32, 0.64) compared with COCP. COCP was inferior for FAI (0.58; 95% CI 0.36, 0.80) and SHBG (−16.61 nmol/L; 95% CI −28.51, −4.71) compared with combination treatment, whereas testosterone did not differ. Metformin lowered insulin (−27.12 pmol/L; 95% CI −40.65, −13.59) and triglycerides (−0.15 mmol/L; 95% CI −0.29, −0.01) compared with COCP. COCP was inferior for insulin (17.03 pmol/L; 95% CI 7.79, 26.26) and insulin resistance (0.44; 95% CI 0.17, 0.70) compared with combination treatment.

Conclusions

The choice of metformin or COCP treatment should be based on symptoms, noting some biochemical benefits from combination treatment targeting both major endocrine disturbances seen in PCOS (hyperinsulinemia and hyperandrogenism).

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

This systematic review is reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline, and was developed to inform clinical practice recommendations in the update of the International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS. This review was part of a larger evidence synthesis covering several pharmacological treatments including COCP, metformin, and anti-androgens and, although each intervention review is reported separately (due to different eligibility criteria), the combined protocol was registered a priori on the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO): CRD42022345640. The methodology utilised in this systematic review is endorsed by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australiaand the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE)and has been previously described in detail in the 2018 guidelinesand in the publicly available Technical Report.

The present systematic review addresses the following clinical question:

Are anti-androgen pharmacological agents, alone or in combination, effective for management of hormonal and clinical PCOS features and weight in adolescents and adults with PCOS?

The Participant-Intervention-Comparison-Outcome (PICO) framework was adopted, with selection criteria developed a priori by the multi-disciplinary guideline development group, including consumers. These eligibility criteria are outlined in Table 1. The search strategy, including database selection and search terms (Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and keywords), was developed in consultation with technical and content experts, clinicians with expertise in PCOS management, and a skilled medical librarian. As this was part of a larger evidence synthesis, a variety of keywords relating to PCOS, anti-androgens, metformin, COCP, and relevant outcomes, were used in the search strategy (Supplementary Material). The following databases were searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, APA PsycInfo, all evidence-based medicine (EBM) reviews (all via Ovid processing), and CINAHL (via EBSCO). The previous 2018 International Evidence-based Guidelines in PCOS searched from inception to 11th January 2017. For the current systematic review, we incorporated the studies identified in the 2018 guideline and reran the search from 2017 to 8th July 2022, with a further updated search on 28th June 2023.

### Recommendations from the international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^115PeCn8]. Fertility and Sterility (2018). Low credibility.

Study Question

What is the recommended assessment and management of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), based on the best available evidence, clinical expertise, and consumer preference?

Summary Answer

International evidence-based guidelines including 166 recommendations and practice points, addressed prioritized questions to promote consistent, evidence-based care and improve the experience and health outcomes of women with PCOS.

What Is Known Already

Previous guidelines either lacked rigorous evidence-based processes, did not engage consumer and international multidisciplinary perspectives, or were outdated. Diagnosis of PCOS remains controversial and assessment and management are inconsistent. The needs of women with PCOS are not being adequately met and evidence practice gaps persist.

Study Design, Size, Duration

International evidence-based guideline development engaged professional societies and consumer organizations with multidisciplinary experts and women with PCOS directly involved at all stages. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II-compliant processes were followed, with extensive evidence synthesis. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied across evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation and ultimately recommendation strength.

Participants/Materials, Setting, Methods

Governance included a six continent international advisory and a project board, five guideline development groups, and consumer and translation committees. Extensive health professional and consumer engagement informed guideline scope and priorities. Engaged international society-nominated panels included pediatrics, endocrinology, gynecology, primary care, reproductive endocrinology, obstetrics, psychiatry, psychology, dietetics, exercise physiology, public health and other experts, alongside consumers, project management, evidence synthesis, and translation experts. Thirty-seven societies and organizations covering 71 countries engaged in the process. Twenty face-to-face meetings over 15 months addressed 60 prioritized clinical questions involving 40 systematic and 20 narrative reviews. Evidence-based recommendations were developed and approved via consensus voting within the five guideline panels, modified based on international feedback and peer review, with final recommendations approved across all panels.

Main Results and The Role Of Chance

The evidence in the assessment and management of PCOS is generally of low to moderate quality. The guideline provides 31 evidence based recommendations, 59 clinical consensus recommendations and 76 clinical practice points all related to assessment and management of PCOS. Key changes in this guideline include: i) considerable refinement of individual diagnostic criteria with a focus on improving accuracy of diagnosis; ii) reducing unnecessary testing; iii) increasing focus on education, lifestyle modification, emotional wellbeing and quality of life; and iv) emphasizing evidence based medical therapy and cheaper and safer fertility management.

Limitations, Reasons For Caution

Overall evidence is generally low to moderate quality, requiring significantly greater research in this neglected, yet common condition, especially around refining specific diagnostic features in PCOS. Regional health system variation is acknowledged and a process for guideline and translation resource adaptation is provided.

Wider Implications Of The Findings

The international guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS provides clinicians with clear advice on best practice based on the best available evidence, expert multidisciplinary input and consumer preferences. Research recommendations have been generated and a comprehensive multifaceted dissemination and translation program supports the guideline with an integrated evaluation program.

Study Funding/Competing Interest(S)

The guideline was primarily funded by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (NHMRC) supported by a partnership with ESHRE and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. Guideline development group members did not receive payment. Travel expenses were covered by the sponsoring organizations. Disclosures of conflicts of interest were declared at the outset and updated throughout the guideline process, aligned with NHMRC guideline processes. Full details of conflicts declared across the guideline development groups are available at https://www.monash.edu/medicine/sphpm/mchri/pcos/guideline in the Register of disclosures of interest. Of named authors, Dr Costello has declared shares in Virtus Health and past sponsorship from Merck Serono for conference presentations. Prof. Laven declared grants from Ferring, Euroscreen and personal fees from Ferring, Euroscreen, Danone and Titus Healthcare. Prof. Norman has declared a minor shareholder interest in an IVF unit. The remaining authors have no conflicts of interest to declare. The guideline was peer reviewed by special interest groups across our partner and collaborating societies and consumer organizations, was independently assessed against AGREEII criteria and underwent methodological review. This guideline was approved by all members of the guideline development groups and was submitted for final approval by the NHMRC.

### Metformin use in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): opportunities, benefits, and clinical challenges [^1119QyLf]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine condition among reproductive‐aged women, affecting 10%–13% of this population. Underpinned by endocrine abnormalities, the multifaceted nature of PCOS includes diverse metabolic, reproductive, dermatological, and psychological sequelae, which vary depending on lifestyle, environmental, ethnic, and genetic factors. The heterogenous and evolving nature of symptoms across the lifespan in PCOS contributes to its complex presentation and has historically made diagnosis challenging. Based on the International Evidence‐based Guideline PCOS diagnostic criteria, which builds on the earlier consensus‐based Rotterdam criteria, PCOS is diagnosed in adults on the basis of two of three components: (i) clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, (ii) ovulatory dysfunction, including anovulation or chronic oligo‐ovulation, and (iii) polycystic ovary morphology or elevated anti‐Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels, after exclusion of other possible aetiologies. Testing for the latter of these criteria (ultrasound or AMH) is only required where the first two criteria are not met. In adolescents, both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction are required, and ovarian features are not included as they are non‐specific for PCOS at this life stage.

### Treatment considerations for the cardiometabolic signs of polycystic ovary syndrome: a review of the literature since the 2013 endocrine society clinical practice guidelines [^111jctzM]. JAMA Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Polycystic ovary syndrome is characterized by an excess in androgen levels, ovarian dysfunction, and polycystic ovarian morphology but is also associated with metabolic dysfunction and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. To our knowledge, there are few therapeutic recommendations for these cardiometabolic risk factors and little evidence of their long-term clinical relevance to cardiovascular health.

Objective

To determine metabolic and/or cardiovascular outcomes in polycystic ovary syndrome treatment literature since the publication of the most recent Endocrine Society clinical practice guidelines in 2013.

Evidence Review

We searched PubMed using a string of variations of polycystic ovary syndrome, therapy/treatment, and adolescence, and we included English-language original research articles published while the 2013 clinical practice guidelines were disseminated (ie, articles published from January 1, 2011, to June 1, 2015). Articles that appeared relevant based on a review of titles and abstracts were read in full to determine relevancy. References from relevant articles were reviewed for additional studies.

Findings

Four topic areas emerged: (1) lifestyle modification, (2) metformin vs placebo or estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives, (3) insulin-sensitizing agents, and (4) estrogen-progestin formulations. Most studies assessed the role of metformin as a monotherapy or dual therapy supplement and found significant benefit when including metformin in polycystic ovary syndrome treatment regimens. Studies showed improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors and, in several, androgen excess and cutaneous and menstrual symptoms. Studies were limited by sample size (range,22–171), few adolescent participants, and short-term outcomes.

Conclusions and Relevance

Findings show potential for metformin and estrogen-progestin dual therapy but warrant longitudinal studies examining outcomes from adolescence through middle age to determine the effect on long-term cardiovascular health.

Management of IGT and T2D in PCOS — there are no large-scale interventional studies specifically related to treatment in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS); diet and lifestyle changes and treatment with metformin, insulin-sensitizing drugs, and other oral hypoglycemic agents may be considered; thiazolidinediones should be used with extreme caution or arguably avoided altogether in women of reproductive age; preliminary studies of bariatric surgery have produced encouraging results in reversing metabolic and endocrine abnormalities.

DISCUSSION

The International Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS and the related translation program aims to provide clinicians with a quality, reliable source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide consistent clinical practice and to empower women with evidence-based information. All recommendations were formulated after an assessment of the best available evidence, multidisciplinary clinical expertise, consumer preferences and structured review by the five GDGs. Detailed methods for stakeholder engagement and guideline development can be found at. The guideline provides 166 recommendations: evidence-based recommendations (EBR) = 31, clinical consensus recommendations (CCR) = 59, and clinical practice points (CPP) = 76. Overall evidence is of low to moderate quality, requiring significant research expansion in this neglected, yet common condition.

We endorse the Rotterdam PCOS Diagnostic Criteria in adults (two of oligo- or anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound), after exclusion of related disorders. Where both oligo- or anovulation and hyperandrogenism are present, ultrasound is not necessary for diagnosis. In adolescents, both oligo-anovulation and hyperandrogenism are required, with ultrasound not recommended for diagnosis. Ultrasound criteria are refined with advancing technology. Antimüllerian hormone levels are not yet adequate for diagnosis of PCOS. Insulin resistance is recognized as a key feature of PCOS, yet clinical measurement is not recommended at the current time. Once diagnosed, assessment and management includes reproductive, metabolic, and psychological features. Education, self-empowerment, multidisciplinary care, and lifestyle intervention for prevention or management of excess weight are prioritized. Depressive and anxiety symptoms should be screened, assessed, and managed and health professionals should be aware of other impacts on emotional wellbeing and quality of life. Combined oral contraceptive pills are first-line pharmacological management for menstrual irregularity and hyperandrogenism, with no specific formulation recommended and with low-dose preparations preferred.
