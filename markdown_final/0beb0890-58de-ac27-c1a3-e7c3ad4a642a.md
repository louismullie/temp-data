## Question

Should blood cultures be collected with staph aureus uti

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether blood cultures should be collected when Staphylococcus aureus is isolated from the urine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether this is uncomplicated cystitis versus complicated UTI or suspected S. aureus bacteremia. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about when to obtain blood cultures in UTI and in S. aureus bacteremia. Next, I will review the evidence on the clinical significance of S. aureus bacteriuria and its association with bacteremia and complications. After that, I need to weigh benefits versus harms of blood cultures, including diagnostic yield, stewardship, and false positives. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and outline concrete actions and exceptions, making sure I double-check any conflicting data before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because the answer hinges on it. S. aureus in urine is uncommon and often reflects hematogenous seeding rather than a primary urinary pathogen, so I need to distinguish isolated bacteriuria from febrile UTI, pyelonephritis, urosepsis, or known S. aureus bacteremia, and I should also consider host factors like immunocompromise, indwelling devices, recent urologic procedures, or structural abnormalities that increase the risk of complications and metastatic infection [^fd4bdc02] [^582cd13b].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidelines. The EAU recommends obtaining two sets of blood cultures before antibiotics in patients with urosepsis, which applies when S. aureus is the uropathogen and there is systemic instability or sepsis physiology, and ESCMID advises considering blood cultures in ED patients with UTI and systemic symptoms when there is antibiotic pretreatment, a chronic indwelling catheter, or immunocompromise, while IDSA guidance emphasizes obtaining cultures before antibiotics in complicated UTI and tailoring therapy to culture results, which indirectly supports blood cultures when S. aureus is involved in a complicated presentation [^8dce3681] [^9a9ca191] [^5186fdd7] [^7a7b5d11] [^e6fdfc78].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify the clinical significance of S. aureus bacteriuria itself. Multiple studies show that concomitant S. aureus bacteriuria with S. aureus bacteremia is common and correlates with more complicated disease, including endocarditis and vertebral osteomyelitis, and that S. aureus bacteriuria can be a marker of hematogenous seeding rather than a primary urinary infection, which strengthens the case for blood cultures when S. aureus is in the urine in the right clinical context [^3c41d266] [^208d5168] [^ea565549] [^aaa41180].

> I need to check the diagnostic yield and potential harms of blood cultures. In complicated UTI cohorts, blood cultures are positive in roughly 20–30% and can reveal uropathogens not isolated from urine, particularly when antibiotics were already given, but false positives from contamination are common and can drive unnecessary antibiotics and longer length of stay, so I should balance pretest probability and collection technique before ordering them indiscriminately [^84f3f41b] [^13e7bced] [^c7b2d77c].

> Let me consider the stewardship perspective. Diagnostic stewardship frameworks advise against low-yield blood cultures and emphasize right test, right patient, right time; in uncomplicated cystitis or in patients with high likelihood of colonization or contamination, routine blood cultures add little and may cause harm, whereas in high-risk presentations they are appropriate and actionable, so I should align ordering with guideline triggers and local contamination mitigation practices [^f0a90e48] [^13e7bced] [^26b1b48d].

> Now, I will synthesize a risk-stratified recommendation. Yes, obtain blood cultures when S. aureus is isolated from urine in the following scenarios: suspected or confirmed urosepsis or systemic instability, complicated UTI with fever and flank pain or prostatitis, immunocompromised hosts, indwelling urinary catheters or recent urologic instrumentation, persistent bacteremia or unclear source, or when the patient is already on antibiotics where discordant results are more likely. Conversely, avoid routine blood cultures for uncomplicated cystitis without systemic features or in clearly colonized, asymptomatic patients with indwelling devices where bacteriuria is expected [^8dce3681] [^9a9ca191] [^5186fdd7] [^84f3f41b] [^582cd13b].

> Wait, let me verify the practical steps so I don't miss anything. If blood cultures are indicated, obtain two sets from different venipuncture sites before initiating antibiotics when feasible, use appropriate volumes and both aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and if the patient already has a urinary catheter, replace it and collect urine from the newly placed device to improve diagnostic clarity. If S. aureus bacteremia is confirmed, follow standard SAB pathways including echocardiography and evaluation for metastatic foci, and tailor antibiotic therapy to susceptibilities with attention to source control [^04b7bb6d] [^375810f9] [^fd4bdc02].

> But wait, what if the urine culture grows S. aureus in an asymptomatic, chronically catheterized patient with no systemic signs? I should double-check that this likely represents colonization or contamination rather than true infection, and in that case blood cultures are not indicated and treating the bacteriuria is discouraged unless there is a clear indication, reinforcing the need to integrate symptoms, signs, and host factors before deciding to culture blood [^cd47c166] [^bc264dcc] [^6d8b22e6].

> In summary, I should confirm that the correct answer is contextual. Yes, obtain blood cultures when S. aureus in urine accompanies systemic symptoms, complicated UTI, sepsis, immunocompromise, indwelling devices, recent urologic procedures, or persistent bacteremia, because the yield is meaningful and results change management. No, do not obtain blood cultures for uncomplicated cystitis or asymptomatic colonization scenarios where the pretest probability of bacteremia is low and the risk of false positives outweighs benefit, and always pair this with proper collection technique and guideline-concordant follow-up if bacteremia is identified [^8dce3681] [^5186fdd7] [^84f3f41b] [^fd4bdc02].

---

In general, **blood cultures are indicated** for Staphylococcus aureus UTIs when there are systemic features (fever, chills, hypotension, altered mental status) [^5186fdd7], immunocompromise, indwelling urinary devices, recent urologic procedures, or poor clinical response, because S. aureus bacteriuria often reflects hematogenous spread and carries a risk of bacteremia and metastatic infection [^3c41d266] [^fd4bdc02]. Routine blood cultures are not required for uncomplicated, non-severe S. aureus UTIs without systemic features, but should be obtained before antibiotics when systemic involvement is suspected or risk factors are present [^7a7b5d11] [^8dce3681].

---

## Clinical significance of S. aureus in urinary tract infections

S. aureus is an **uncommon uropathogen** and is often associated with complicated UTIs, particularly in patients with indwelling urinary catheters, recent urologic procedures, or immunocompromised states [^582cd13b]. The presence of S. aureus in urine cultures may indicate:

- **Hematogenous spread**: S. aureus bacteriuria can be secondary to bacteremia from distant sources, such as endocarditis, osteomyelitis, or skin and soft tissue infections [^3c41d266] [^fd4bdc02].

- **Metastatic infections**: S. aureus bacteremia is associated with high rates of metastatic infections, including endocarditis, vertebral osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis [^fd4bdc02].

- **Increased severity**: S. aureus UTIs are often associated with more severe clinical presentations, including systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, and septic shock [^ea565549].

---

## Indications for blood cultures in S. aureus UTIs

Current guidelines and expert consensus recommend obtaining **blood cultures** in the following scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for blood cultures** |
|-|-|
| Systemic symptoms (fever, chills, hypotension, altered mental status) | Strong indication [^5186fdd7] |
| Immunocompromised patients | Strong indication [^5186fdd7] |
| Indwelling urinary catheters or recent urologic procedures | Strong indication [^5186fdd7] |
| Poor clinical response to initial antibiotic therapy | Strong indication [^notfound] |
| Uncomplicated, non-severe S. aureus UTI without systemic features | Not routinely indicated [^7a7b5d11] |

---

## Evidence supporting blood cultures in S. aureus UTIs

Several studies have highlighted the **clinical importance** of obtaining blood cultures in S. aureus UTIs:

- **Bacteremia risk**: Studies have demonstrated that S. aureus bacteriuria is frequently associated with bacteremia, particularly in patients with systemic symptoms or risk factors [^3c41d266] [^208d5168].

- **Metastatic infections**: Concurrent S. aureus bacteriuria and bacteremia are associated with increased risk of metastatic infections, including endocarditis and osteomyelitis [^3c41d266] [^fd4bdc02].

- **Clinical outcomes**: Patients with S. aureus bacteriuria and bacteremia have higher rates of complications and mortality compared to those without bacteremia [^ea565549].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), European Association of Urology (EAU), and European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) provide the following **recommendations**:

- **IDSA guidelines**: Recommend obtaining blood cultures in patients with complicated UTIs, particularly when systemic symptoms are present or when S. aureus is isolated from urine cultures [^notfound].

- **EAU guidelines**: Recommend obtaining blood cultures in patients with urosepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) [^8dce3681].

- **ESCMID guidelines**: Recommend considering blood cultures in patients with systemic symptoms, immunocompromised states, or indwelling urinary devices [^5186fdd7].

---

## Potential risks and benefits of obtaining blood cultures

Benefits include early detection of bacteremia, enabling timely initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy and reducing the risk of metastatic infections and complications, as well as improved clinical outcomes through targeted therapy and reduced morbidity and mortality [^fd4bdc02]. Risks include false positives, which may lead to unnecessary antibiotic use and increased healthcare costs, and false negatives, which may occur if blood cultures are obtained after antibiotic initiation or due to inadequate sample volume [^13e7bced] [^04b7bb6d].

---

## Clinical judgment and patient-specific factors

Clinical judgment should guide the decision to obtain blood cultures, considering patient-specific factors such as age, comorbidities, severity of illness, and response to initial therapy. In elderly patients, those with chronic illnesses, or those with indwelling urinary devices, the threshold for obtaining blood cultures should be lower due to the higher risk of complications [^5186fdd7].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Blood cultures are indicated for Staphylococcus aureus UTIs when systemic symptoms, immunocompromise, indwelling urinary devices, or poor clinical response are present. Routine blood cultures are not required for uncomplicated, non-severe S. aureus UTIs without systemic features. Clinical judgment and patient-specific factors should guide the decision to obtain blood cultures, balancing the potential benefits of early bacteremia detection against the risks of false positives and unnecessary antibiotic use.

Suggested duration of therapy by site of infection

UTI, urinary tract infection.

Antibiotic durations should always be individualized to the patient and their clinical status. Many studies have underrepresentation of critically ill patients.

# 7 days is recommended in patients with community-acquired pneumonia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

* Consider prolonged courses of 14 days with non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli due to an increased risk of relapse/recurrence with shorter courses.

¶ After definitive source control.

† Trials excluded immunocompromised patients, patients with indwelling prostheses, infectious syndromes that required prolonged durations, or organisms that required prolonged durations of treatment (i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus lugdunensis). Most evidence for shorter courses is in bacteremia from gram negative bacteria secondary to urinary tract infections. Control of the primary source and blood culture clearance should also be achieved.

### The additional value of blood cultures in patients with complicated urinary tract infections [^84f3f41b]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2014). Low credibility.

We evaluated 800 hospitalized patients with a complicated urinary tract infection, from whom both a blood and a urine culture were obtained on the first day of antibiotic treatment. Urine cultures were positive in 70% of patients, and blood cultures were positive in 29%. In 7% of patients, uropathogens caused bacteraemia with a pathogen that was not isolated from urine. Receiving antibiotic therapy at the moment of hospitalization was the only factor independently associated with discordant culture results (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.18–3.61). For those receiving antibiotics at the moment of hospitalization, blood cultures have additional diagnostic value over urine cultures.

### Blood cultures for women with uncomplicated acute pyelonephritis: are they necessary? [^41a0ed63]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

To assess the utility of blood cultures in the management of uncomplicated pyelonephritis in women, we prospectively collected data from 583 cases. Discordant cases were defined as those for which the pathogens isolated from urine and from blood were different. We found that 97.6% of cases were nondiscordant. Clinical and microbiological evolution of infection did not differ between the 2 groups, and no changes of antibiotic therapy were required on the basis of blood culture results. Blood culture may not be routinely required for the evaluation of uncomplicated pyelonephritis in women.

### Clinical significance of Staphylococcus aureus bacteriuria in a nationwide study of adults with S. aureus bacteraemia [^3c41d266]. The Journal of Infection (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the clinical significance of Staphylococcus aureus bacteriuria (SABU) in adults with S. aureus bacteraemia (SAB).

Methods

All individuals ≥ 18 years old diagnosed with SAB in Iceland between December 1st 2003 and November 30th 2008 were retrospectively identified. Data was collected from medical records. Concomitant SABU was defined as growth of S. aureus in a urine sample taken within 24 h of the index blood culture.

Results

SABU was seen in 27 of 166 (16.3%) SAB patients having urine cultured before administration of antibiotics, but after excluding those with SAB of urinary tract origin SABU was seen in 16 of 152 (10.5%). In this latter cohort SABU was independently associated with having endocarditis (RR 6.68; 95% CI 1.53–17.3) and admission to intensive-care unit (RR 2.84; 95% CI 1.25–4.44), while for having complicated SAB the RR was 1.56 (95% CI 0.96–1.80). No correlation was seen with mortality or relapse rates.

Conclusions

SABU appears to be secondary to SAB in some cases while it is the primary infection causing SAB in others. In patients with SAB of non-urinary tract origin SABU should probably be regarded as distant haematogenous seeding and a marker of deep tissue dissemination, thus affecting general management and treatment duration.

### Isolation of Staphylococcus aureus from the urinary tract: association of isolation with symptomatic urinary tract infection and subsequent staphylococcal bacteremia [^373092a2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Staphylococcus aureus is frequently isolated from urine samples obtained from long-term care patients. The significance of staphylococcal bacteriuria is uncertain. We hypothesized that S. aureus is a urinary pathogen and that colonized urine could be a source of future staphylococcal infection.

Methods

We performed a cohort study of 102 patients at a long-term care Veterans Affairs facility for whom S. aureus had been isolated from clinical urine culture. Patients were observed via urine and nasal cultures that were performed every 2 months. We determined the occurrence of (1) symptomatic urinary tract infection concurrent with isolation of S. aureus (by predetermined criteria), (2) staphylococcal bacteremia concomitant with isolation of S. aureus from urine, and (3) subsequent episodes of staphylococcal infection.

Results

Of 102 patients, 82% had undergone recent urinary catheterization. Thirty-three percent of patients had symptomatic urinary tract infection at the time of initial isolation of S. aureus, and 13% were bacteremic. Eight-six percent of the initial urine isolates were methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Seventy-one patients had follow-up culture data; 58% of cultures were positive for S. aureus at ≥ 2 months (median duration of staphylococcal bacteriuria, 4.3 months). Sixteen patients had subsequent staphylococcal infections, occurring up to 12 months after initial isolation of S. aureus; 8 late-onset infections were bacteremic. In 5 of 8 patients, the late blood isolate was found to have matched the initial urine isolate by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing.

Conclusions

S. aureus is a cause of urinary tract infection among patients with urinary tract catheterization. The majority of isolates are methicillin-resistant S. aureus. S. aureus bacteriuria can lead to subsequent invasive infection. The efficacy of antistaphylococcal therapy in preventing late-onset staphylococcal infection in patients with persistent staphylococcal bacteriuria should be tested in controlled trials.

### Infrastructure and current practice of blood culture diagnostics in patients with sepsis: teachings and recommendations from the European sepsis care survey [^78d4f4c6]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Comparisons of the results of the ESCS with published evidence

The ESCS was designed based on the recommendations and suggestions of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) and tried to investigate the compliance of Europe health care systems with early sepsis recognition, diagnosis and management. One similar study is published from China and showed that the existence of sepsis bundles of care was more frequent in tertiary hospitals than in secondary hospitals. In this context, microbiological diagnostics using blood cultures, which represent the golden standard for the detection of bloodstream infections, is of particular importance.

A summary of the retrieved PubMed search is presented in Table 1. A close look at the Table taking into consideration the retrieved answers to the ESCS suggests that in all suggested practices for sepsis care the feedback of the health-care professionals (HCPs) who completed the ESCS shows that the average adherence is more than 80% with two exceptions: availability of microbiology diagnosis limited to 10% and antibiotic stewardship for the selection of the most appropriate antibiotic limited to 65%. It is evident that these two factors influence each other. However, the biggest limitation is the lack of a continuous microbiology service and the timely limited processing of blood cultures. The process around blood cultures involves sampling, transport to the laboratory, loading of samples into an incubator, extracting positive samples, pathogen identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. All steps are required to provide the prescribing clinician with information around appropriate antimicrobials, but only very few hospitals provided all 24/7 (24 h daily for every day). This is in line with results of a previous survey in 2019 that revealed limited laboratory opening hours.

The experts of the ESA decided to provide some suggestions for the improvement of microbiology diagnostics with emphasis on the need for collection and processing of blood cultures. A similar attempt has recently been published by experts appointed by the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID). The ESCMID experts did not identify published evidence to support recommendations and the majority were graded based on good clinical practice and expert opinion. However, these recommendations are limited to community-acquired pneumonia, urinary tract infection and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. We positioned the following statements:

In a prospective study involving 642 patients with febrile urinary tract infection (UTI), we found antimicrobial pretreatment (odds ratio [OR], 3.3), an indwelling urinary catheter (OR, 2.8), and malignancy (OR, 2.7) to be independent risk factors for bacteremia with a uropathogen that was not cultured or recognized in the urine. Although the diagnostic value of blood cultures has been questioned in UTI, we advocate performing blood cultures for patients with these risk factors.

### Identification and validation of clinical phenotypes inbloodstream infection and their association with mortality (FEN-AUREUS study) [^692fb99e]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Variables and definitions

The variables considered to derive the clinical phenotypes were collected within the first 24 h from blood culture extraction and included age, gender, comorbidities, blood chemistry and blood cell counts, likely S. aureus -portal of entry, source of bacteraemia, severity of infection and methicillin-susceptibility. The full list of variables is shown in Table 1. Additionally, variables related to early clinical management, such as antibiotic treatment, source control or ID consultation, and centre, were included. The main endpoint was 30-day all-cause mortality; patients discharged before day 30 were contacted by phone at the end of the follow-up period to assess their status.

Table 1
Features and outcomes of patients in the derivation cohort and in the phenotypes obtained.

The probable portal of entry for SAB refers to the anatomical site through which the pathogen is believed to have entered the bloodstream. This was determined based on specific criteria (Supplementary Table S1), with only permitted one portal per case. They were classified as vascular catheter-related, skin and soft tissues, respiratory tract, and genito-urinary tract. If no probable portal could be determined, the entry was classified as unknown.

The site of infection refers to the primary organ site where the infection was located at the time the first positive blood culture was taken. The site of infection might or might not coincide with the portal of entry (e.g. a vascular catheter may be the portal of entry in a patient who later develops knee arthritis as the site of infection). Eventually, more than one source could be identified in a patient. Sources were determined based on clinical data, imaging studies, and isolation of the microorganism in specific source-related samples. Sources considered are listed in Supplementary Table S1.

Source control was defined as follows: if the bacteraemia was associated with a removable intravascular device, the source was considered controlled if the device was removed within 3 days. Alternatively, if the bacteraemia was related to a removable non-device source, such as an abscess, the source was considered controlled if the non-device related source was addressed (e.g. drained or surgically removed) within the same timeframe.

### Predictors of bacteremia in emergency department patients with suspected infection [^b0ae15cd]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

The goal of this study is to identify clinical variables associated with bacteremia. Such data could provide a rational basis for blood culture testing in emergency department (ED) patients with suspected infection.

Methods

This is a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort of ED patients with suspected infection. Data collected included demographics, vital signs, medical history, suspected source of infection, laboratory and blood culture results and outcomes. Bacteremia was defined as a positive blood culture by Centers for Disease Control criteria. Clinical variables associated with bacteremia on univariate logistic regression were entered into a multivariable model.

Results

There were 5630 patients enrolled with an average age of 59.9 ± 19.9 years, and 54% were female. Blood cultures were obtained on 3310 (58.8%). There were 409 (12.4%) positive blood cultures, of which 68 (16.6%) were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and 161 (39.4%) were Gram negatives. Ten covariates (respiratory failure, vasopressor use, neutrophilia, bandemia, thrombocytopenia, indwelling venous catheter, abnormal temperature, suspected line or urinary infection, or endocarditis) were associated with all-cause bacteremia in the final model (c-statistic area under the curve [AUC], 0.71). Additional factors associated with MRSA bacteremia included end-stage renal disease (odds ratio [OR], 3.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9–7.8) and diabetes (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1–3.6) (AUC, 0.73). Factors strongly associated with Gram-negative bacteremia included vasopressor use in the ED (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.7–4.6), bandemia (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 2.3–5.3), and suspected urinary infection (OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 2.8–5.8) (AUC, 0.75).

Conclusions

This study identified several clinical factors associated with bacteremia as well as MRSA and Gram-negative subtypes, but the magnitude of their associations is limited. Combining these covariates into a multivariable model moderately increases their predictive value.

### Prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in culture-proven sepsis and outcomes associated with inadequate and broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic use [^05f79347]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Broad-spectrum antibiotics are recommended for all patients with suspected sepsis to minimize the risk of undertreatment. However, little is known regarding the net prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens across all patients with community-onset sepsis or the outcomes associated with unnecessarily broad empiric treatment.

Objective

To elucidate the epidemiology of antibiotic-resistant pathogens and the outcomes associated with both undertreatment and overtreatment in patients with culture-positive community-onset sepsis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study included 17 430 adults admitted to 104 US hospitals between January 2009 and December 2015 with sepsis and positive clinical cultures within 2 days of admission. Data analysis took place from January 2018 to December 2019.

Exposures

Inadequate empiric antibiotic therapy (ie, ≥ 1 pathogen nonsusceptible to all antibiotics administered on the first or second day of treatment) and unnecessarily broad empiric therapy (ie, active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA]; vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus [VRE]; ceftriaxone-resistant gram-negative [CTX-RO] organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa; or extended-spectrum β-lactamase [ESBL] gram-negative organisms when none of these were isolated).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Prevalence and empiric treatment rates for antibiotic-resistant organisms and associations of inadequate and unnecessarily broad empiric therapy with in-hospital mortality were assessed, adjusting for baseline characteristics and severity of illness.

Results

Of 17 430 patients with culture-positive community-onset sepsis (median [interquartile range] age, 69 [57–81] years; 9737 [55.9%] women), 2865 (16.4%) died in the hospital. The most common culture-positive sites were urine (9077 [52.1%]), blood (6968 [40.0%]), and the respiratory tract (2912 [16.7%]). The most common pathogens were Escherichia coli (5873 [33.7%]), S aureus (3706 [21.3%]), and Streptococcus species (2361 [13.5%]). Among 15 183 cases in which all antibiotic-pathogen susceptibility combinations could be calculated, most (12 398 [81.6%]) received adequate empiric antibiotics. Empiric therapy targeted resistant organisms in 11 683 of 17 430 cases (67.0%; primarily vancomycin and anti-Pseudomonal β-lactams), but resistant organisms were uncommon (MRSA, 2045 [11.7%]; CTX-RO, 2278 [13.1%]; VRE, 360 [2.1%]; ESBLs, 133 [0.8%]). The net prevalence for at least 1 resistant gram-positive organism (ie, MRSA or VRE) was 13.6% (2376 patients), and for at least 1 resistant gram-negative organism (ie, CTX-RO, ESBL, or CRE), it was 13.2% (2297 patients). Both inadequate and unnecessarily broad empiric antibiotics were associated with higher mortality after detailed risk adjustment (inadequate empiric antibiotics: odds ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.03–1.37; P = 0.02; unnecessarily broad empiric antibiotics: odds ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.06–1.40; P = 0.007).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, most patients with community-onset sepsis did not have resistant pathogens, yet broad-spectrum antibiotics were frequently administered. Both inadequate and unnecessarily broad empiric antibiotics were associated with higher mortality. These findings underscore the need for better tests to rapidly identify patients with resistant pathogens and for more judicious use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for empiric sepsis treatment.

### Principles of diagnostic stewardship: a practical guide from the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America diagnostic stewardship task force [^13e7bced]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). High credibility.

Diagnostic stewardship focus — blood, urine, respiratory cultures, and Clostridioides difficile testing — highlights priority targets: for blood cultures, they are "one of the most commonly ordered microbiologic tests in hospitalized patients with low positivity and high risk of false-positive results (up to half of all positive blood cultures represent contaminants)", with additional concerns that "a significant number of blood cultures are collected as single blood cultures and/or with inappropriate blood volume" and that "inappropriate testing may overestimate central-line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs)". For urine cultures, they are "one of the most common drivers of inappropriate antimicrobial use in hospitalized patients", have "common clinical false-positive results (positive tests due to colonization without UTI)", and "inappropriate testing may overestimate catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs)". For respiratory cultures, there is a "high risk of positive results representing colonization, especially among patients with comorbidities, in the intensive care unit, or with tracheostomy", and they are a "common driver of inappropriate antibiotic use in hospitalized patients". For C. difficile testing, "inappropriate testing may detect colonization and expose patients to unnecessary antibiotics" and "inappropriate testing may overestimate nosocomial C. difficile cases".

### Are blood cultures necessary in the management of women with complicated pyelonephritis? [^e0aa536e]. The Journal of Infection (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

Data from previous studies suggest that blood cultures in women with uncomplicated acute pyelonephritis (APN) are of limited value. Our objective was to assess the role of blood cultures in the management of complicated APN in women, and to examine the demographic and clinical characteristics, and the outcome as related to the bacteremic status of these patients.

Methods

Data from medical records of 158 women hospitalized with complicated APN over a 2-year period were analyzed retrospectively. It included demographic, clinical and laboratory data, details of the empiric antimicrobial therapy, urine and blood culture results, complications and clinical outcome.

Results

Out of 158 women with complicated APN, in 155 (98%) pathogens grew in the urine culture, and 33 (20.9%) of them had bacteremia. In the great majority of patients (98.7%), the blood cultures were sterile, or contained the same phenotypically profiled pathogen that was isolated from the urine. Only in two patients (1.3%), the blood cultures grew pathogens different from those found in the urine. The initial empiric antimicrobial therapy was not changed in any of the patients. No significant difference existed between the bacteremic and nonbacteremic patients in the demographic and clinical characteristics, the severity of disease or the outcome.

Conclusion

In the management of complicated APN, routine cultures of blood should be reevaluated.

### Quantifying the relationship between Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and S. aureus bacteriuria: a retrospective analysis in a tertiary care hospital [^efa454f7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

In this retrospective cohort study, patients who had Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia but who lacked signs and symptoms of urinary tract infection due to S. aureus and who did not have an indwelling urinary catheter had a likelihood of S. aureus bacteriuria of 2.5% (2 of 79 patients). Therefore, we strongly question the theory that S. aureus bacteremia causes S. aureus bacteriuria.

### Comparative study of the bacterial distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens in older and younger patients with urinary stones [^5e6b1a20]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

In general, overuse and misuse of antimicrobials have contributed tocontinued resistance development, posing a serious public health burden. A typical example is the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, which is responsible for considerable difficult-to-treat infections in humans. The increasing antimicrobial resistance of uropathogens is challenging the paradigm of empirical antibiotic therapy for UTIs patients with urolithiasis, underlining the need for developing appropriate treatment strategies. New strategies with safe and effective approaches to manage UTIs with stones could have an important role in the older people.

One of the limitations of our study is that uropathogens isolated from upper and lower urinary stones were not distinguished and compared. Furthermore, it is preferable to combine stone culture results (even blood culture if necessary), as midstream urine cultures might not completely reflect the reality of UTIs. Moreover, the effects of high susceptibility and resistant antibiotics after the patients were treated needed to be evaluated in the future. Given that not all patients underwent surgery, we do not have a complete stone composition. Given the retrospective study design, it is possible that there are clinical parameters related to the treatment decisions and clinical outcomes we did not include or miss. Additionally, we excluded a significant number of patients with diabetes, chronic urinary retention and incomplete medical records, which may limit the impact and generalizability of our findings.

### Predictors of mortality of streptococcal bacteremia and the role of infectious diseases consultation: a retrospective cohort study [^dbf80900]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

In our institution, infectious diseases consultants are informed of patients with positive blood cultures after species identification. In contrast to Staphylococcus aureus and Candida spp. infectious diseases consultation for streptococcal bacteremia is not mandatory. Follow-up blood cultures until sterilization were performed in patients exhibiting persistent symptoms or suspected of having infected endocarditis. Additionally, although not as common as in cases of S. aureus bacteremia or candidemia, clinicians often ordered follow-up blood cultures for patients with bacteremia involving any Gram-positive coccus.

The date of collection of the first positive blood culture was defined as bacteremia onset. A new episode was included if more than 30 days had passed since the cessation of antibiotic treatment for the initial bacteremia. The classification of bacteremia cases as community, healthcare-associated, or nosocomial followed the criteria established by Friedman et al Sepsis or septic shock were defined in accordance with the criteria proposed by the Sepsis-3 International Consensus. The diagnosis of infective endocarditis was made by the endocarditis team. The determination of the infection site was based on the assessment by the infectious diseases consultant, taking into account clinical, radiological, microbiological, and operative findings. Appropriate antimicrobial treatment was defined as the initiation of at least 1 antimicrobial agent with in vitro activity against the infecting isolate. Source control was considered warranted in the following situations: (1) removal of venous catheter in patients with catheter-related bacteremia or bacteremia of unknown origin with the presence of a venous catheter; (2) imaging-guided or surgical drainage of infected collections; (3) joint fluid drainage (arthrotomy, arthroscopy, needle aspiration); (4) cardiac surgery in endocarditis patients when indicated for heart failure; and (5) correction of urinary tract obstruction.

Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia — infection control specimen collection and empiric therapy emphasize timely evaluation and cultures. Perform a comprehensive assessment of patient for severity of illness (including signs and symptoms of shock) and localizing signs and symptoms of infection, and evaluate central venous line site for presence of infection. Every effort should be made to collect bacterial culture specimens before administration of antibiotics; however, empiric antibiotic therapy should NOT be delayed for the purposes of specimen collection only. For patients with signs of fever, neutropenia, or sepsis, antibiotics should be administered as soon as possible, and recommend stress dose steroids for patients with sepsis. Both aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures of appropriate volume (based on age and weight) should be collected based on institutional guidelines, and consider obtaining a urine culture in all febrile patients and infants, or in any patient with genitourinary symptoms or with a urinary catheter in place before empirical antibiotics are dispensed.

Pyelonephritis in pregnancy — initial management recommends inpatient care and targeted antibiotics, stating that "clinicians initially should manage pyelonephritis in pregnancy in the inpatient setting". Empiric therapy "should have adequate renal tissue penetration and be targeted against the most likely pathogens", then "should be adjusted as needed based on urine culture and sensitivity". "Parenteral antibiotics should be continued until the patient is clinically improving", and "patients should complete a total of 14 days of antibiotic therapy". Diagnostic stewardship includes that patients "should have a midstream or catheterized urine specimen collected", which "should be obtained before antibiotics are initiated, but treatment should not be delayed while awaiting culture results". Regarding blood cultures, they "may not be clinically useful", with "one study" reporting they were "positive in 21% of patients but rarely changed clinical management".

### Principles of diagnostic stewardship: a practical guide from the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America diagnostic stewardship task force [^f0a90e48]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). High credibility.

SHEA position paper — diagnostic stewardship is defined as modifying the ordering, performing, or reporting of diagnostic tests to improve the diagnosis and treatment of infections and other conditions, and is described as interventions prioritizing the right test, for the right patient, to prompt the right action. Historically a laboratory activity focused on optimizing specimen collection, processing, and reporting to ensure accurate test results and interpretation, more recently there has been increasing understanding that test results can strongly influence antimicrobial utilization, including that up to 80% of hospitalized patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria are inappropriately treated with antibiotics. A wide array of healthcare professionals, including physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and infection preventionists, can play a role in optimizing test use and these stakeholders should be involved in the development and implementation of diagnostic stewardship initiatives. Diagnostic stewardship has traditionally focused on inpatients; however, it has expanded to other healthcare settings including ambulatory and long-term care settings, with targets varying by population such as optimizing testing for group A Streptococcus in ambulatory settings versus urine cultures and C. difficile testing for nursing homes. An awareness and understanding of pretest probability of infection is essential for designing interventions; many interventions function by increasing test use in high-value settings and discouraging or blocking testing in low-value settings where there is a low probability of disease and greater potential for false-positives results that may result in patient harm, such as blood culture for cystitis. The most common type of inappropriate microbiologic testing is overtesting, which can lead to diagnostic errors in the form of overdiagnosis, unnecessary antimicrobial treatment, and excess cost.

### The clinical significance of concurrent Staphylococcus aureus bacteriuria in patients with S. aureus bacteremia [^aaa41180]. The Journal of Infection (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the clinical significance of Staphylococcus aureus bacteriuria (SABU) in patients with S. aureus bacteremia (SAB).

Methods

We reviewed clinical data for 203 patients with SAB from January 2006 to July 2007 in a tertiary care hospital. In all patients, blood and urine cultures were performed concurrently. Among these cases, we compared clinical data between patients with and without SABU. To rule out mere colonization of S. aureus through indwelling urinary catheters (IDUC), we excluded patients using IDUC and then repeated the analyses.

Results

Concurrent SABU was observed in 31 of 203 patients (15.3%). In patients without an IDUC, 25 of 128 (19.5%) were positive for SABU. Concurrent SABU was associated with methicillin-susceptible, community-onset SAB, urinary tract obstruction/surgery, urinary tract infection, and vertebral osteomyelitis in patients with SAB. In patients without an IDUC, methicillin-susceptible SAB, urinary tract obstruction, urinary tract infection, and vertebral osteomyelitis were associated with concurrent SABU. Finally, concurrent SABU was not associated with the severity and fatality of SAB.

Conclusion

We found that SABU was not a result of colonization via IDUC, but instead is a frequent concomitant of SAB. In septic conditions, especially without IDUC, SABU may indicate SAB with foci of infection in the urinary tract or the vertebral column.

### Is first-line antimicrobial therapy still adequate to treat MRSA in the ICU? A report from a highly endemic country [^4bd25760]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections cause great concern in intensive care units (ICUs). Although strict infection control protocols have reduced staphylococcal colonization, the ICU still represents a reservoir for MRSA infections, playing a role in their circulation to multiple wards and hospitals. In critically ill patients, lack of adequate treatment may lead to increased mortality. For this reason, broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy is often justified among critically ill patients.

We retrospectively analyzed the characteristics of S. aureus bloodstream infections (SA-BSI) from two Italian University hospitals during 2010–2014. A total of 17/337 (5%) were ICU patients; of these, 16 (94%) had MRSA-BSI compared with 36% (116/320) from other wards (P < 0.001). Lower adequate first-line therapy (defined as therapy administered within 48 h of the positive blood culture and effective against a susceptible pathogen) and infectious diseases (ID) specialist consultation were documented in ICU versus non-ICU patients (18 versus 60% and 53 versus 24%, P < 0.001 and P = 0.02, respectively). When only MRSA infections were considered, adequate therapy and ID consultation remained more common in non-ICU patients (Table 1; difference not significant). Inadequate therapy for non-ICU and ICU patients was mainly associated with beta-lactam use (62/104 versus 10/12, respectively, P = 0.19). Patients with MRSA infections in the ICU displayed a lower Charlson score, longer hospitalizations, higher rates of nosocomial infections, endocarditis, and central venous catheter (CVC) and urinary catheter placement. Source control, including CVC removal, was significantly higher in ICU versus non-ICU patients (Table 1). A stepwise logistic regression analysis identified ICU stay (odds ratio (OR) 19.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.4–384.2, P < 0.001), presence of intravascular devices other than CVCs for over 72 h (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1–13.2, P = 0.04), and pulmonary source of infection (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.2–9.4, P = 0.02) as factors associated with MRSA-BSI. Overall crude 7- and 30-day mortality was similar for MRSA- (Table 1) and SA-BSI (13 versus 18% in non-ICU and 25 versus 29% in ICU patients, respectively). Multivariate analysis identified as independent factors for 7-day mortality among patients with MRSA an inadequate targeted treatment (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04–0.86, P = 0.03), absence of ID consultation (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.04–0.6, P = 0.004), and occurrence of endocarditis (OR 4.8, 95% CI 1.4–17.5, P = 0.01) or septic shock (OR 15.9, 95% CI 4.6–66.7, P < 0.001). High Charlson score (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.1–1.5, P = 0.004) and septic shock (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.0–7.9, P = 0.04) were significantly associated with 30-day mortality.

### Procalcitonin and pyuria-based algorithm reduces antibiotic use in urinary tract infections: a randomized controlled trial [^017f8c7d]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Results

We screened 394 patients, of whom 269 were not eligible due to the exclusion criteria, patient refusal, or other reasons. Thus, 125 patients were enrolled in the ITT analysis and 3 (2%) patients were lost to follow-up. As predefined, 96 (77%) patients with microbiologically confirmed UTIs and no protocol violations constituted the PP analysis (Figure 2).

Figure 2
Flow diagram of patients in trial.

In five patients, the final diagnosis was retrospectively different from a UTI: one patient with an infected kidney cyst with Klebsiella oxytoca in blood cultures and two patients with prostatitis with Staphylococcus aureus in blood and urine cultures and with Escherichia coli in urine culture, respectively, received prolonged courses of antibiotics. One patient with severe sepsis due to Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis died during the initial hospitalization, and another patient was diagnosed with fibromyalgia syndrome as explanation for costovertebral angle tenderness and had a sterile urine culture.

The baseline characteristics were generally well-balanced except for the distribution of patients with bacteremia, namely 19 (30%) in the control group and 9 (15%) in the PCT-pyuria group (P = 0.045; Table 1); 95 (76%) of the 125 patients were women and 84 (67%) had a febrile UTI. The median age was 73 years (range, 19–96 years); 35 (28%) were treated as outpatients.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^8dd1ee01]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Along with abundance and purity, additional factors also dictate how each colonial morphotype is characterized by the laboratory. These include the method of collection (invasive versus non-invasive), characteristics of the patient (pediatric versus adult, etc.), as well as the identity of the organisms themselves. Species generally considered urogenital flora (e.g. viridans Streptococcus and coagulase-negative staphylococci other than S. saprophyticus) are infrequently pursued. Various guidelines synthesize these parameters as a framework for working up isolates, including whether to perform definitive taxonomic ID and phenotypic AST. Typically, complete ID/AST is performed for each of one or two cultured urinary isolates. For voided urine, isolation of a uropathogen at > 10⁵ CFU/mL is interpreted as the highest evidence of clinical significance, a threshold that shifts down by 1 log for invasively collected specimens. With properly collected specimens, diagnostic cultures from healthy individuals typically generate no colonies (cases of ASB notwithstanding), yielding a reference value of No Growth Observed.

Although guidelines help ensure intra-laboratory standardization, traditional culture protocols are beset by key shortcomings. First and foremost, one must recognize the workflow limitations of culture in relation to diagnostic turnaround and clinical impact. Initial culture data are not available the same day as specimen collection, and traditional phenotypic AST adds at least 1 more day to final reporting. By the time definitive laboratory results can guide care, a patient may have already received several days of empiric therapy. Timeframe aside, the practice of inferring clinical significance from cultured bacterial concentrations stems from historical studies with circumscribed scope. A threshold of 10⁵ CFU/mL derives from work focusing on the reproducibility of semi-quantitative data in the context of ASB, as well as the progression of patients to pyelonephritis. Nevertheless, this same approach is now applied to virtually every patient population for whom a culture is desired. A urine culture is now even employed for motivations outside the diagnosis of UTI proper, including evaluation of patients for bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis. As many laboratories attest, the broad application of a method that was initially developed around a narrow focus can led to poor sensitivity/specificity in many scenarios.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "Urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^cc33e945]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Materials & Methods

All consecutive patients bearing an isolated diagnostic code for UTI/cystitis within a single healthcare system during July 2019 were identified by the ICD‐10 diagnostic code (Appendix SA). The healthcare system utilized was a large tertiary medical center in a major metropolitan city with high patient volumes. July 2019 was selected to avoid any alterations in treatment delivery resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. Patients demonstrating clinical signs or hemodynamic features of bacteremia, positive blood cultures, medical comorbidities associated with complicated UTI (e.g. indwelling catheter, recent urologic surgery, pregnancy, immunodeficiency, or transplant), or those admitted for inpatient care were excluded, resulting in a cohort of 909 patients.

2.1 Data Collection

Manual chart review was utilized to extract demographic (e.g. age, gender), clinical (e.g. symptoms), and microbial (e.g. features of microscopic urinalysis, urine microbiological testing) data from patients who met inclusion criteria. We also catalogued antibiotic treatments used, alternative diagnoses explored, and urine culture and susceptibility results. Symptoms were designated as "acute" if arising < 7 days before the encounter and "chronic" when present for > 28 days before presentation. The presence of "UTI symptoms", specified by the American Urological Association and expert consensus, was defined as either dysuria or hematuria with at least one additional urinary symptom, including urinary urgency, urinary frequency, worsening incontinence, or suprapubic pressure in the absence of any vaginal symptoms. "Mental Status Changes" (MSC) captured symptomatology such as altered mental status, confusion, and lethargy. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, or Enterococcus faecalis were defined as the most common "uropathogenic" bacteria, while all other species were designated as atypical bacteria. Risk factors for complicated UTIs such as anatomic abnormalities of the urinary tract, systemic disease, immunodeficiency, pregnancy, or history of multidrug resistance bacteria were not collected. Clinical definitions are defined in Appendix SB.

### Probable enterotoxin-associated toxic shock syndrome caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis [^71ea06cf]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Staphylococcus epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococcal species are most often recognized as pathogens, either in prematurely born infants or in settings of indwelling medical devices, including central lines or bladder catheters. In the absence of such risk factors, certain coagulase-negative staphylococci such as S. saprophyticus are well recognized to cause urinary tract infections in young women. S. epidermidis urinary tract infections in older adults, by contrast, are related to bladder catheterization and can be complicated by bacteremia. Pediatric case reports suggest that S. epidermidis can cause pyelonephritis in children with no predisposing risk factors, and caution is warranted that this organism not be uniformly dismissed as a skin contaminant.

In our patient, with negative blood cultures, the question remains as to the significance of the pure urine culture of S. epidermidis. Even if discounted as a cause of bacteriuria, its presence as a skin colonizer may hold clinical significance in this child, whose clinical presentation including persistent hallucinations is consistent with a toxigenic illness (toxic shock syndrome-like), in whom no other convincing pathogen could be determined, and whose timing of clinical recovery was consistent with an expected response to antibiotics. Neurologic abnormalities are common in cases of TSS. It is formally possible, but highly unlikely, that there was some obscure locus of S. aureus infection which was not observed.

### New testing guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia [^7ceef8ba]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this article is to review diagnostic testing recommendations outlined in the current American Thoracic Society (ATS)/Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline and the 2021 ATS guideline for noninfluenza respiratory viruses.

Recent Findings

Diagnostic testing in CAP with gram stain, lower respiratory and blood cultures, Streptococcal and Legionella urinary antigens are not routinely recommended unless identified as severe CAP or with risk factors for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Influenza virus testing remains a strong recommendation during periods of community viral spread. An additional 2021 ATS clinical practice guideline reviewed the use of molecular testing for noninfluenza viral pathogens in adults with suspected CAP and recommended testing in those hospitalized with severe CAP and/or various immunocompromising conditions.

Summary

Diagnostic testing remains an important component of confirming and treating CAP. The CAP guideline includes recommendations surrounding diagnostic testing with lower respiratory gram stain and culture, blood cultures, Legionella and Pneumococcal urinary antigen, influenza viral testing and serum procalcitonin. There is a strong recommendation to obtain influenza virus testing during periods of community spread. However, the use of other diagnostics such as gram stain, lower respiratory and blood culture, and urinary antigen testing are dependent on severity of illness and whether a patient has been identified as having strong risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa infection. The 2021 ATS clinical practice document did not routinely recommend testing noninfluenza respiratory viruses unless identified as having severe CAP and/or various immunocompromising conditions.

Urinary tract infections — key laboratory diagnosis points state that in the absence of signs and symptoms consistent with urinary tract infection, a urine culture is typically not recommended, and urine collected for culture should not be kept at room temperature for more than 30 minutes, with specimens held at refrigerator temperatures or in a preservative tube if not processed within 30 minutes. Reflex to culture based on a positive pyuria screen may be considered, but if a reflex algorithm is implemented, it should be a locally approved policy guided by clinicians and laboratorians. Three or more species of bacteria in a urine specimen usually indicates contamination at the time of collection and interpretation remains challenging.

Due to the high prevalence of methicillin-resistant S aureus, empiric therapy should include coverage for methicillin-resistant S aureus and be guided by local infection rates, antibiotic sensitivities, and dialysis center policies. Once the final organism and sensitivities are identified, patients should receive long-term antibiotic treatment according to the CDC or IDSA guidelines, for 4 to 6 weeks for uncomplicated S aureus.

### Updated recommendations from the ATS and IDSA | AAFP… [^1605bed7]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Routine blood cultures, sputum cultures, and urinary antigen testing are not beneficial in patients with nonsevere CAP.
- The Pneumonia Severity Index is recommended to determine the need for hospitalization, whereas the ATS/IDSA criteria for severe CAP are recommended to predict the need for intensive care. | Major criteria Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation Severe shock requiring vasopressors Minor criteria Blood urea nitrogen ≥ 20 mg per dL Confusion or disorientation Core temperature < 96. 8°F Hypotension requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation Multilobar. Diagnostic Testing BLOOD AND SPUTUM CULTURES Routine blood and sputum cultures have not been shown to improve patient outcomes in CAP. Sputum cultures are recommended before treatment initiation only if the patient has severe CAP, and particularly if he or she is intubated; if the patient has a history of methicillin-resistant.

Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection or if he or she is being empirically treated for these pathogens; or if the patient was hospitalized and received parenteral antibiotics within the previous 90 days. Lower respiratory tract samples from intubated patients with severe CAP should be sent for Gram stain and culture soon after intubation because of the higher risk of MRSA or P. aeruginosa infection, and because endotracheal aspirates have a higher yield than sputum samples. Blood cultures should be obtained if the patient has severe CAP; was previously or is currently being treated empirically for MRSA or P. aeruginosa infection, particularly respiratory infections; or if the patient was hospitalized and received parenteral antibiotics within the previous 90 days. The yield of blood cultures is low in adults without severe CAP, and empiric therapy is rarely changed based on these results.

URINARY ANTIGEN TESTING Urinary antigen testing for Legionella or pneumococcus has not been shown to improve outcomes. Based on low-quality evidence, the ATS/IDSA guideline suggests that routine urine testing for pneumococcal antigen be performed only in severe cases of CAP and that urine testing for Legionella antigen be performed only in cases of severe CAP, exposure to a Legionella outbreak, or travel to an endemic area.

### Concomitant Staphylococcus aureus bacteriuria is associated with complicated S. aureus bacteremia [^208d5168]. The Journal of Infection (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To identify factors associated with complicated Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) in adults.

Methods

Prospective observational multicenter study during 2 years in Nice University Hospital and during 6 months in the Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou, Paris, including all adult inpatients with SAB assessed by an Infectious Diseases (ID) specialist.

Results

We included 104 SAB (79 in Nice and 25 in Paris), of which 45 were complicated, including 18 endocarditis and 23 bone and joint infections. A concomitant urine sample was performed in 65% of the cases, showing S. aureus bacteriuria 23/68 (34%) times. Blood cultures were drawn 48-96h after an appropriate antibiotic therapy had been started in 70 of the 104 cases (67%) and were positive in 28 cases (40%).

Conclusions

The 3 following factors were found to be associated with complicated SAB in univariate analysis: community acquisition (56% vs 26%, P = 0.002), concomitant bacteriuria (47% vs 19%, P = 0.016) and persistent bacteremia (55% vs 26%, P = 0.016). This last factor was associated with endocarditis, but not with other complications such as bone and joint infections.

### Follow-up blood cultures in young infants with bacteremic urinary tract infections [^21fa6f93]. Hospital Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Researchers in previous studies suggest that the clinical yield of follow-up blood cultures (FUBCs) is low in infants with bacteremic urinary tract infection (UTI) because persistent bacteremia is rare; however, no researchers have analyzed the practice of routinely obtaining FUBCs. In our study, we evaluate outcomes in infants with FUBCs, examine opportunities for improvement of blood culture practices, and add important information to inform both clinical practice as well as further study.

Design

This retrospective cohort study included infants < 90 days of age with bacteremia and UTI with the same pathogen at 22 hospitals that make up Intermountain Healthcare between 2002 to 2020. Infants with culture proven meningitis, osteomyelitis, central line infection, and infections occurring during NICU hospitalization were excluded.

Results

Total number of patients with bacteremic UTI was 174, 153 (88%) patients had at least 1 FUBC, 14 of 153 (9%) had a positive FUBC with same organism, and 4 of 153 (3%) were contaminants. The length of stay was longer for patients with positive FUBCs. Patients with Escherichia coli are more likely to have a negative FUBC. Readmissions within 30 days were similar among infants with positive FUBCs, negative FUBCs, and no FUBCs.

Conclusions

FUBCs in infants with bacteremic UTI should not be routinely performed, especially for E coli, and it is unclear whether FUBCs improve outcomes.

### Prospective evaluation of blood cultures in a Turkish university hospital: epidemiology, microbiology and patient outcome [^f2540cb6]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2003). Low credibility.

The aims of this prospective study were to: (1) determine the rate of blood culture contamination; (2) describe and compare the epidemiologic, clinical and microbiological characteristics of hospital- and community-acquired bloodstream infections; and (3) determine the mortality resulting from bloodstream infections. The rate of true bacteremia was 12.1%, and 10.7% of cultures were contaminated. Of the 567 episodes of bloodstream infection, 73.4% were hospital-acquired, and 26.6% were community-acquired. The most commonly isolated microorganisms were staphylococci (44%, methicillin resistant 69.4%), enterococci (15%) and Escherichia coli (12.5%) in hospital-acquired episodes, and Brucella spp. (21.9%), E. coli (19.2%) and Staphylococcus aureus (14.6%, methicillin resistant 9.1%) in community-acquired episodes. While the overall mortality rate was 25.4%, death attributable to bloodstream infections was 16.6% in hospital-acquired episodes and 13.9% in community-acquired episodes. The highest mortality occurred in patients with bacteremia due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (37.5%) in hospital-acquired episodes, and in patients with bacteremia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (50%) in community-acquired episodes. Underlying diseases, severity of illness, presence of bladder catheter, previous use of antibiotics, tracheal intubation and adequacy of treatment were found to be significantly associated with death.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^33829b7b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Urinalysis with reflex-to-culture algorithms — pyuria thresholds and exceptions indicate there is no single laboratory parameter or combination of parameters that can sufficiently predict whether the patient has a urinary tract infection or if bacteria will be recovered in culture, and that pyuria alone is likely the best marker in terms of negative predictive value, with leukocyte esterase or white blood cells (WBCs) increasing the likelihood of a positive culture, although detection methods have not been standardized. Although > 10 WBCs per low power field is a commonly adopted threshold for a urinalysis with reflex to culture (UARC) algorithm, this threshold cannot be effectively applied to all patient groups, and exceptions are recommended for patients who are pregnant and for patients with urologic abnormalities or undergoing urologic procedures. Laboratory algorithms should take into account local patient populations and should be guided by both clinicians and laboratorians, and in older adults with mental status changes or other signs classically localizing UTI symptoms, bacteriuria may be unrelated and a thoughtful approach should be taken before interpretations are made.

### Improving antimicrobial use through better diagnosis: the relationship between diagnostic stewardship and antimicrobial stewardship [^eed71186]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). High credibility.

Diagnostic stewardship and antimicrobial stewardship — complementary interventions across patient diagnosis and treatment — are described as providing a critically important opportunity to improve diagnosis and complement downstream antimicrobial stewardship activities, and they can be incorporated at any point during the patient care pathway where diagnostic testing and reporting occurs. In a febrile patient, diagnostic stewardship informs antibiotic selection across the pathway: in patient evaluation, clinical decision support (CDS) can help direct diagnostic testing towards appropriate patient populations in evidence-based scenarios given known risk factors and symptoms; during patient testing, patient testing can guide sampling of proper specimen with appropriate collection techniques, and improper or contaminated specimens can be detected; in initial diagnosis and empiric therapy, Gram stain and rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results are reported with real-time decision support to assist in interpretation; in refining diagnosis and adjusting therapy, interim results with context or guidance can be reported (e.g., "no MRSA isolated" or "no Pseudomonas isolated"); and in finalizing diagnosis and therapy, antimicrobial susceptibilities can be reported (e.g., selective antibiotic susceptibility reporting). These approaches should be, and often are, used concomitantly to reach their common goals, including complementary roles to reduce inappropriate urinalysis and urine-culture testing and treatment of bacteriuria in asymptomatic patients with indwelling urinary catheters, accomplished through a combination of CDS, best-practice advisory alerts, specimen rejection protocols, laboratory result reporting guidance, handshake stewardship, and audit and feedback.

### Improving antimicrobial use through better diagnosis: the relationship between diagnostic stewardship and antimicrobial stewardship [^5e930282]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). High credibility.

Diagnostic stewardship — planning, balancing metrics, and safety monitoring — urine cultures generally should be discouraged in patients without urinary symptoms; however, in certain situations urine cultures should be obtained, such as in young infants, pregnant patients, or those undergoing invasive urologic procedures, even in the absence of symptoms. For this reason, planning ahead and creating balancing metrics are critical; for example, when planning to reduce urine cultures, one balancing metric could be hospital-onset bacteremia from a urinary source or failure to obtain urine cultures where indicated, and passive monitoring of patient-centered safety measures should occur along with review of aggregate data following implementation of a diagnostic stewardship intervention. Multiple potential clinical indications exist for most diagnostic tests; consequently, the impact of diagnostic stewardship interventions may only be readily apparent after the intervention has been implemented, and instead of creating exceptions it may be best to make alternative ordering processes specific to certain departments or clinics.

### Principles of diagnostic stewardship: a practical guide from the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America diagnostic stewardship task force [^c89f0cc7]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). High credibility.

Diagnostic stewardship — urine cultures — Avoid testing in nonspecific clinical syndromes (eg, leukocytosis, isolated fever, fatigue, and fall), do not order based on odor or smell, and educate on prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria and lack of treatment benefit. For collection, do not collect from catheter bag and only culture urine if pyuria present on urinalysis. For reporting, use selective and cascade reporting to help tailor antibiotic choices and add comments to nudge toward only using antibiotics with true symptoms of UTI.

### Maximizing positive outcomes for patients with staphylococcal infections [^99371d34]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2009). Low credibility.

Maximizing positive outcomes for serious Gram-positive infections, such as those caused by Staphylococcus species, requires an aggressive treatment approach. Although specific approaches will depend upon many factors, the underlying common strategy should recognize the positive contribution of minimizing complications and inpatient treatment duration and the efficient use of healthcare resources, while also focusing on rapid resolution of infection and safety and tolerability. To advance the standard of care for patients, we need to utilize therapies that enable such a range of factors to be improved. Treatment guidelines are useful to establish evidence-based standards of care, but they are updated infrequently and there is currently no pan-European consensus for the treatment of staphylococcal infections. With the benefit of the clinical experience that has been acquired for the most recently licensed antibiotics, together with an appreciation of the appropriate usage of older agents, there are good prospects for achieving positive outcomes earlier and in a greater range of patients with staphylococcal infections, and treatment guidelines should be updated regularly to reflect this.

### Community acquired infections in older patients admitted to hospital from care homes versus the community: cohort study of microbiology and outcomes [^b2e15268]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Data extraction, linkage and analysis

The exposure variable was residence in a nursing or residential home, collectively termed care homes. The addresses for all nursing and residential homes were taken from Health Board records and any patient who was registered at one of these addresses was identified as a care home resident.

The primary outcome was death, in or outside hospital, within 30 days of admission with infection. This was ascertained from the National Register of Deaths. Covariates for the mortality analysis were place of residence, sepsis severity, resistance of isolates, age, sex and Charlson Index of co-morbidity.

A Charlson Index of co-morbidity was calculated for each individual from hospital discharge codes for the current admission and any other admissions in the previous year. Case note reviews were performed to extract details about evidence of site (LRTI, SSTI, UTI or other) and severity of infection. We used a previously published method to stratify severity of infection according to markers of sepsis (presence of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome in the context of infection) and severe sepsis (Standardised Early Warning System score ≥ 4).

Microbiological information including sensitivity data were obtained from Central Vision.

Data about initial antimicrobial therapy and results of all microbiology tests were reviewed independently by two Infectious Diseases physicians (CM and PD) in order to address three questions about each microbial isolate from cultures:

1. Was the isolate clinically significant?

2. If significant, was it a "resistant" pathogen, i.e. meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), or Gram negative bacteria resistant to cefuroxime, co-amoxiclav and/or ciprofloxacin?

3. If significant, was it sensitive to at least one antimicrobial included in the initial therapy?

Decisions about the clinical significance of each microbial isolate were made depending on the site of culture. Blood cultures: all isolates were coded as clinically significant with the exception of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Skin: only Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) isolates were coded as clinically significant, as there were no streptococci isolated from any skin samples in the study. Sputum: Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarhalis, Klebsiella spp. Pseudomonas spp. and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were classified as clinically significant, and other isolates (e.g. Escherichia coli (E. coli) or other coliforms) were classified as not significant. Urine: all isolates were coded as clinically significant.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^d49b6f40]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Additional blood tests, and imaging can be useful depending on the subgroup of cUTI, both for initial diagnosis and subsequently (Table 2), with the rationale for their use often different at different stages in the infection. For example, USS of the kidneys and urinary tract during the acute phase can neither rule in nor rule out an upper UTI (pyelonephritis) or vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). Therefore, the role of acute USS in children with urosepsis, septic shock, poor urine flow, abdominal or bladder mass and increased creatinine is to determine whether there is acute obstruction that needs urgent surgical intervention.USS may be performed for different reasons, including failure to respond with suitable antibiotics within 48 hours to investigate for renal abscess, or for recurrent UTI to assess for other urological abnormalities needing intervention.

All children should be reassessed 48 hours after diagnosis for (1) clinical response to treatment, (2) confirmation of the diagnosis and (3) potential targeting of antibiotics according to susceptibility (aim to the narrow antimicrobial spectrum).

Treatment should be stopped if the UTI diagnosis is not confirmed, that is, most cases with a negative urine culture with no prior antibiotics to explain this. If the response to treatment is atypical and does not follow the expected trajectory after 48 hours, reassessment for the cause is imperative, rather than simply switching to IV or broader-spectrum antibiotics (although either of these could be needed). Depending on the clinical situation, repeat urine culture, inflammatory markers, serum creatinine and renal USS may be needed to confirm the UTI diagnosis and assess for complications. Other investigations may be needed to seek an alternate/additional diagnosis.

How Should Children With cUTI be Treated?

Treatment of cUTI involves consideration of antibiotic route, choice and duration and supportive management. The majority of RCTs and meta-analyses of childhood UTIs exclude those with cUTIs, so recommendations largely rely on a synthesis of retrospective studies (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 2,) and expert opinion to provide a practical empirical guideline to initiate treatment (Table 3). Due to the variability of complicating features even within subgroups, a further individualized approach is often needed, considering local antibiograms, past urine cultures, antibiotic exposure, hospital admissions, urine catheterization and other host factors, including allergies.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^6f1f4d02]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Neutropenia and asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) — urinary source frequency and screening implications: With current management strategies for high-risk neutropenia patients, the urinary tract is an infrequent source for bacteremia. In a retrospective review of hospitalized febrile neutropenia, patients with ANC ≤ 1500 cells/mm³ within 4 weeks of chemotherapy had low urinary tract infection (UTI) rates, with only 2.8% overall, including 2.9% in those with ANC ≤ 100 cells/mm³, and only 1 of 109 had bacteremia from a urinary source. While no studies specifically address screening, screening for bacteriuria with specific antimicrobial treatment, if present, has not been reported to provide important additional benefits. Patients with low-risk neutropenia (< 7 days, clinically stable, ANC > 100 cells/mm3) have a lower risk of infection and are assumed to have risks similar to nonneutropenic populations.

Complicated UTI with Gram-negative bacteremia — In patients presenting with complicated UTI with associated Gram-negative bacteremia and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course (7 days) of antimicrobial therapy rather than a longer course (14 days) (conditional recommendation, low certainty in the evidence). An effective antimicrobial agent for bacteremic patients means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the bloodstream, urine, and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy.

### Redefining Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a structured approach guiding diagnostic and therapeutic management [^203a6047]. The Journal of Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) is characterized by a unique ability to involve metastatic infections in almost every organ system in the body. Around 20% of the patients with SAB die within 30 days. In patients with SAB, the distinction between uncomplicated and complicated SAB is therapeutically important, as guidelines recommend different treatment durations for these two entities. However, this dichotomous classification strategy can incompletely reflect the heterogeneity of SAB. In this viewpoint, we discuss the limitations of the currently used definitions for SAB. We then propose a new approach to define the extent of infection in patients with SAB, providing an individualized framework for diagnosis and treatment.

### Urinary tract infection in male patients: challenges in management [^38cfbfed]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections in male patients share many of the management principles as used in the management of female patients, including the need to accurately define the clinical syndrome, choose empirical therapy based on the severity of illness and the potential for antimicrobial resistance, and consider the need for source control in severely ill patients. The microbiology of the causative organisms is more unpredictable compared to female patients, and data to inform treatment decisions from clinical trials specific to male patients are relatively scarce.

### European society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases guidelines for antimicrobial stewardship in emergency departments (endorsed by European association of hospital pharmacists) [^4efd28ca]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Scope

This European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to support a selection of appropriate antibiotic use practices for patients seen in the emergency department (ED) and guidance for their implementation. The topics addressed in this guideline are (a) Do biomarkers or rapid pathogen tests improve antibiotic prescribing and/or clinical outcomes? (b) Does taking blood cultures in common infectious syndromes improve antibiotic prescribing and/or clinical outcomes? (c) Does watchful waiting without antibacterial therapy or with delayed antibiotic prescribing reduce antibiotic prescribing without worsening clinical outcomes in patients with specific infectious syndromes? (d) Do structured culture follow-up programs in patients discharged from the ED with cultures pending improve antibiotic prescribing?

Methods

An expert panel was convened by European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases and the guideline chair. The panel selected in consensus the four most relevant antimicrobial stewardship topics according to pre-defined relevance criteria. For each main question for the four topics, a systematic review was performed, including randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Both clinical outcomes and stewardship process outcomes related to antibiotic use were deemed relevant. The literature searches were conducted between May 2021 and March 2022. In April 2022, the panel members were formally asked to suggest additional studies that were not identified in the initial searches. Data were summarized in a meta-analysis if possible or otherwise summarized narratively. The certainty of the evidence was classified according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria. The guideline panel reviewed the evidence per topic critically appraising the evidence and formulated recommendations through a consensus-based process. The strength of the recommendations was classified as strong or weak. To substantiate the implementation process, implementation trials or observational studies describing facilitators/barriers for implementation were identified from the same searches and were summarized narratively.

Recommendations

The recommendations on the use of biomarkers and rapid pathogen diagnostic tests focus on the initiation of antibiotics in patients admitted through the ED. Their effect on the discontinuation or de-escalation of antibiotics during hospital stay was not reported, neither was their effect on hospital infection prevention and control practices. The recommendations on watchful waiting (i.e. withholding antibiotics with some form of follow-up) focus on specific infectious syndromes for which the primary care literature was also included. The recommendations on blood cultures focus on the indication in three common infectious syndromes in the ED explicitly excluding patients with sepsis or septic shock. Most recommendations are based on very low and low certainty of evidence, leading to weak recommendations or, when no evidence was available, to best practice statements. Implementation of these recommendations needs to be adapted to the specific settings and circumstances of the ED. The scarcity of high-quality studies in the area of antimicrobial stewardship in the ED highlights the need for future research in this field.

### Primary measure: blood culture contamination rate… [^c7b2d77c]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

What to know
- Microbiology laboratories identify probable contamination by isolating skin commensal bacteria such as Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus from one set out of two blood culture sets.
- Learn how to classify organisms such as potential blood culture contaminants and calculate the blood culture contamination rate.
- CDC recommends laboratories calculate and report their blood culture contamination rate at least monthly. Overview The microbiology laboratory determines a probable contaminated blood culture by the identification of a skin commensal organism in one set out of multiple sets collected in a 24-hour period. Understanding how often this occurs at the institutional level is critically important to maintaining quality practices at your facility and improving patient care. The primary measure is a way for you to calculate the relative incidence of contaminated blood cultures at your facility.

This allows you to monitor compliance with best practices and determine if mitigation strategies are needed. CDC encourages laboratories to evaluate their blood culture contamination rate at least monthly. This section provides a method to help you determine which specimens are eligible for inclusion when calculating the BCC rate and understand how to classify and report potential contaminants. Primary measure eligibility criteria If your laboratory identifies the presence of a skin commensal organism in a blood culture set, you should only include that set in the primary measure calculation if all the following criteria are met:

- Patient is at least 18 years old.
- Patient may be present in any hospital department such as the intensive care unit, emergency department, inpatient floors, and step-down units.
- Institutions may choose to include outpatients in their analysis.
- At least two blood culture sets are collected in a 24-hour period.

Reporting the presence of commensal organisms in eligible sets If your laboratory identifies the presence of a skin commensal organism in a set that meets the primary measure eligibility criteria, you could report the test result to the clinician as follows: "Single-set positive out of two sets may indicate the presence of possible skin contaminant, clinical correlation required. Please call the laboratory if further work–up is needed. " This comment alerts the clinician of a probable contaminant event and allows them to evaluate the clinical situation and determine next steps, if needed.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^cd8ef029]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) with sepsis — empiric antibiotic selection: For patients with sepsis due to complicated UTI, we suggest initially selecting among the following antibiotics, using the four-step assessment (Figure 1.1): third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, piperacillin-tazobactam, or fluoroquinolones, and rather than newer agents (novel beta lactam-beta lactamase inhibitors, cefiderocol, plazomicin) or older aminoglycosides (conditional recommendation, very low to moderate certainty of evidence). Agents with broader spectrum of activity against organisms other than Enterobacterales (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococci, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) may be considered for patients with sepsis in whom the diagnosis of cUTI is not clear or who are suspected to have cUTI due to these pathogens.

Educate HCP about the importance of urine culture stewardship and provide indications for urine cultures. (Quality of evidence: LOW) Consider requiring clinicians to identify an appropriate indication for urine culturing when placing an order for a urine culture. The indication should be supported by the literature,– and should be appropriate for the specific patient population. Include guideline-based remindersfor the specific circumstances. Below is a simple example of appropriate and inappropriate reasons to culture urine are referenced online on the CDC website, though several other lists are available in the literature specific to particular clinical settings (eg, ICU, emergency department, nursing home, and catheterized versus non-catheterized patients): Appropriate uses of urine culture include the following: Presence of symptoms suggestive of a urinary tract infection (UTI): Flank pain or costovertebral angle tenderness Acute hematuria New pelvic discomfort New onset or worsening sepsis without evidence of another source on history, physical examination, or laboratory testing Fever or altered mental status without evidence of another source on history, physical examination, or laboratory testing In spinal-cord-injury patients and other highly complex patients (eg, patients with > 40% total body burn, recipients of kidney transplants with graft failure) symptoms may include increased spasticity, autonomic dysreflexia, and/or sense of unease. Inappropriate uses of urine cultures include the following: Odorous, cloudy, or discolored urine in the absence of other localizing signs and symptoms Reflex urine cultures based on urinalysis results, such as pyuria, in the absence of other indications (absence of pyuria suggests diagnosis other than CAUTI) Urine culture to document response to therapy unless symptoms fail to resolve.
Provide training on appropriate collection of urine. Specimens should be collected and should arrive at the microbiology laboratory as soon as possible, preferably within an hour. If delay in transport to the laboratory is expected, samples should be refrigerated (no more than 24 hours) or collected in preservative urine transport tubes. (Quality of evidence: LOW)
Train clinicians to consider other methods for bladder management (eg, intermittent catheterization, or external male or female collection devices) when appropriate before placing an indwelling urethral catheter. (Quality of evidence: LOW)
Share data in a timely fashion and report to appropriate stakeholders. (Quality of evidence: LOW)

### Low-risk Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia patients Do not require routine diagnostic imaging: a multicenter, retrospective, cohort study [^f0a22bc6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, this study advocates for a structured approach along with risk stratification for the management of SAB patients. Several days after bacteremia onset, patients with low risk of clinically significant metastatic infections can be identified using easily obtainable clinical parameters. This strategy necessitates the performance of (repeated) bedside ID consultation, the collection of follow-up blood cultures, and a critical review of disease evolution. Our study found that metastatic infections were rare using this approach and that the omission of radiological imaging was not associated with lower 90-day relapse-free survival, suggesting that routine imaging may be unnecessary for low-risk SAB patients. To enhance the effectiveness of risk stratification beyond 10% of the overall SAB population, further investigations should concentrate on identifying additional factors that ascertain patients at low risk for metastatic infections.

### Diagnostic and commensal Staphylococcus pseudintermedius genomes reveal niche adaptation through parallel selection of defense mechanisms [^22ffb653]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Study cohort and identification

Human clinical specimens were cultured in the Barnes-Jewish Hospital Clinical Microbiology Laboratory in St. Louis, MO, USA, according to laboratory standard operating procedures. Isolates from these specimens (n = 181), primarily from human wounds, tissue, respiratory tract, and drainage, were collected as part of routine clinical care, with cultures submitted from patients with clinical symptoms suggestive of infection. Clinical specimens were plated to agar medium according to the laboratory's standard operating procedures for each specimen type. In general, specimens were plated to sheep's blood, chocolate, and MacConkey agar (Remel, Lenexa, KS, USA). Isolates of S. pseudintermedius were most commonly obtained from the sheep's blood agar plate. All human diagnostic isolate collection occurred between December 2011 and July 2019. The diagnostic canine and feline SIG isolates were selected from a collection of isolates recovered from submissions to the Kansas State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. These isolates were recovered from specimens submitted for clinical culture, primarily from animal urinary tract and skin and soft tissue infections (n = 100), with primary isolation occurring between January 2016 and June 2019. Isolates recovered from nondescript specimen types ("swab"), duplicate submissions from the same veterinarian-owner combination (over the entire study period), and non-viable isolates were not eligible for inclusion in this study and were replaced with the next eligible isolate until a total of 25 isolates were identified per calendar year. Colonizing isolates (from human nares, axillae, or inguinal folds and from dogs nares, mouth, or dorsal fur) and household environmental surface isolates (e.g. bed linens, kitchen table, refrigerator door handle, bathroom countertop, bathroom faucet handles, bathroom light switch, toilet seat, bathtub, television remote control, computer keyboard and mouse, and telephone) were collected through two S. aureus surveillance projects among households with children with recent S. aureus infections – the Staph Household Intervention for Eradication (SHINE; NCT02572791) and Household Observation of MRSA in the Environment 2 (HOME2; NCT01814371) as previously described, (Pet = 108, Human = 31, Surface = 151). All samples were selected from the first timepoint in which a SIG isolate was recovered from a specific individual, pet, or environment site. For human samples, the nares were prioritized, followed by the axillae, and then the inguinal folds. In pets, the nares or mouth sample was prioritized, followed by the dorsal fur sample. In each of these studies, participants performed a decolonization regimen to eradicate S. aureus carriage from the skin and nares, consisting of intranasal mupirocin application and daily chlorhexidine gluconate body washes or dilute bleach-water baths.

### Routine blood cultures in the management of pyelonephritis in pregnancy for improving outcomes [^90cb832d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Pyelonephritis is a type of urinary tract infection (UTI) that affects the upper urinary tract and kidneys, and is one of the most common conditions for hospitalisation among pregnant women, aside from delivery. Samples of urine and blood are obtained and used for cultures as part of the diagnosis and management of the condition. Acute pyelonephritis requires hospitalisation with intravenous administration of antimicrobial agents. Several studies have questioned the necessity of obtaining blood cultures in addition to urine cultures, citing cost and questioning whether blood testing is superfluous. Pregnant women with bacteraemia require a change in the initial empirical treatment based on the blood culture. However, these cases are not common, and represent approximately 15% to 20% of cases. It is unclear whether blood cultures are essential for the effective management of the condition.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of routine blood cultures to improve health outcomes in the management of pyelonephritis in pregnant women.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register without language or date restrictions (31 December 2014).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials comparing outcomes among pregnant women with pyelonephritis who received initial management with or without blood cultures. Cluster-randomised trials were eligible for inclusion in this review but none were identified. Clinical trials using a cross-over design were not eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed one trial report for inclusion.

Main Results

We identified one trial report but this was excluded. No clinical trials met the inclusion criteria for this review.

Authors' Conclusions

There are no large-scale randomised controlled trials to assess outcomes in the management of pyelonephritis in pregnancy with or without blood cultures. Randomised controlled trials are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of managing pyelonephritis in pregnant women with or without blood cultures, and to assess any adverse outcomes as well as the cost-effectiveness of excluding blood cultures from treatment.

### Redefining Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a structured approach guiding diagnostic and therapeutic management [^9be2fa77]. The Journal of Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

The current duration of therapy in patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) is based on differentiating complicated from uncomplicated disease. While this approach allows clinicians and investigators to group SAB patients into broadly similar clinical categories, it fails to account for the intrinsic heterogeneity of SAB. This is due in part to the fact that risk factors for metastatic infection and confirmed metastatic infection are considered as equivalent in most scoring systems. In this viewpoint, we propose a two-step system of categorizing patients with SAB. Initially, patients with SAB would be categorized as 'high risk' or 'low risk' for metastatic infection based upon an initial set of diagnostic procedures. In the second step, patients identified as 'high-risk' would undergo additional diagnostic evaluation. The results of this stepwise diagnostic evaluation would define a 'final clinical diagnosis' to inform an individualized final treatment plan.

### Intensive care unit-acquired urinary tract infections in a regional critical care system [^6cee1f41]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Definitions

An ICU-acquired UTI was defined using a modification of the criteria of Costel and colleagues as those patients with a positive urine culture (at least 100,000 colony-forming units/ml of one or two organisms) first identified on ICU day 3 (48 hours) or later. Patients with positive urine cultures within 48 hours of ICU discharge were also considered to have ICU-acquired UTIs. A bacteremic/fungemic UTI was defined as a UTI with a concomitantly positive blood culture with the same organism within a 48 hour period. A surgical patient was any patient recorded as having an operative diagnosis or admitted from the trauma ward, post cardiac surgery care unit, or directly from the operating room. Severity of illness and intensity of care at admission were assessed using the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) and the Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (TISS) scores, respectively. Shock was deemed to be present if a vasopressor infusion was required. Laboratory testing was performed in accordance with standard guidelines as described previously with the exception that, as of June 2001, only cultures either positive by screening by an ATPase–luciferase assay or by specific physician request were cultured. Antimicrobial-resistant organisms were defined as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis or faecium, or any Gram-negative organisms resistant to one or more of ciprofloxacin, tobramycin/gentamicin, ceftazidime, piperacillin, or imipenem.

### Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) with associated S. aureus bacteriuria (SABU) as a predictor of complications and mortality [^ea565549]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteremia (SAB) is associated with a high rate of complications, most of which are related to hematogenous seeding into deep tissues or prosthetic material. SA bacteriuria (SABU) has been described in association with SAB, but has not been evaluated as a predictor for complicated bacteremia, which was the objective of our study. METHODS (DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS): We conducted a retrospective study of patients admitted to the hospital with SAB. The 118 patients included in the study were divided in 2 cohorts: a group with SABU and a group without SA in the urine. We followed the 2 cohorts for an average of 8 months and evaluated the differences in complications and mortality.

Results

SABU was found in 28 of 118 patients with SAB. Eighteen patients (64%) in this group had complications from the bacteremia, while in the group without SABU only 33% (30/90 patients) had complications (P = 0.004). The SABU group also had more deaths (32% vs. 14%; P = 0.036).

Conclusions

In this population of hospitalized patients with SAB, the presence of SABU was associated with an increased risk of early complications, including septic shock, and with higher mortality. A routine urine culture in search of SABU may be a helpful tool for detection of those patients with SAB who are at increased risk of complications and death.

### The changing landscape of uncomplicated Gram-Negative bacteremia: a narrative review to guide inpatient management [^9c5f4d1c]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Gram-negative bacteremia secondary to focal infection such as skin and soft-tissue infection, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, or urinary tract infection is commonly encountered in hospital care. Current practice guidelines lack sufficient detail to inform evidence-based practices. Specifically, antimicrobial duration, criteria to transition from intravenous to oral step-down therapy, choice of oral antimicrobials, and reassessment of follow-up blood cultures are not addressed. The presence of bacteremia is often used as a justification for a prolonged course of antimicrobial therapy regardless of infection source or clinical response. Antimicrobials are lifesaving but not benign. Prolonged antimicrobial exposure is associated with adverse effects, increased rates of Clostridioides difficile infection, antimicrobial resistance, and longer hospital length of stay. Emerging evidence supports shorter overall duration of antimicrobial treatment and earlier transition to oral agents among patients with uncomplicated Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia who have achieved adequate source control and demonstrated clinical stability and improvement. After appropriate initial treatment with an intravenous antimicrobial, transition to highly bioavailable oral agents should be considered for total treatment duration of 7 days. Routine follow-up blood cultures are not cost-effective and may result in unnecessary healthcare resource utilization and inappropriate use of antimicrobials. Clinicians should incorporate these principles into the management of gram-negative bacteremia in the hospital.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^99949f99]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Cystitis and pyelonephritis — quantitative urine culture thresholds and test utilization specify that the standardized threshold in symptomatic patients is > 100 000 CFU/mL for organisms identified as common pathogens, though many sites now use either 10 000 CFU/mL or 1000 CFU/mL based on the method of collection or patient population as a baseline for culture workup and clinical significance. Laboratories typically provide antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) for potential pathogens recovered in significant gram numbers as part of standard laboratory protocol. The Gram stain is not routinely utilized for the diagnosis of uncomplicated urinary tract infection, but it may have limited utility in patients with febrile urinary tract infection (pyelonephritis, prostatitis, urosepsis) where high numbers of gram-negative bacilli may be present in urine screen. Because urine may be readily contaminated with urogenital microbiota, proper specimen collection is essential for urine culture and should be performed using a process that minimizes contamination from the perineal and superficial mucosal microbiota.

### ACP best practice No 167: the laboratory diagnosis of urinary tract infection [^a24bbfbe]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection is common, and it is not surprising that urine specimens make up a large proportion of those samples submitted to the routine diagnostic laboratory. Many of these specimens will show no evidence of infection and several methods can be used to screen out negative samples. Those that grow bacteria need to be carefully assessed to quantify the degree of bacteriuria and hence clinical relevance. To influence treatment, a final report should be produced within 24 hours of specimen receipt, with turnaround times continuously monitored. Much work needs to be done to determine the cost effectiveness involved in processing urine specimens and the evidence base for the final report provided.

### The utility of risk factors to define complicated Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in a setting with low methicillin-resistant S. aureus prevalence [^16cf540a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Risk factors have low to moderate predictive value to identify complicated SAB. Using risk factors to define complicated SAB, as recommended by IDSA guidelines, may increase the proportion of patients with complicated SAB by 20%. Because classification is used to guide the duration of antibiotic treatment, this will inadvertently lead to unnecessary prolonged antibiotic use. These findings illustrate that in patients with SAB, better criteria, in addition to reliable additional diagnostic procedures, are needed to optimize clinical management.

Which Investigations Are Needed at Diagnosis and During Complicated UTI?

Patient history and clinical review underpin the diagnosis of UTI and assessment of complicating features at presentation (GRADE D).
Urine collection should be done by clean catch, catheterization or suprapubic aspiration and urine analysis, culture and susceptibility testing should be undertaken for all children (GRADE C).
Additional blood investigations for cUTI may include inflammatory markers, full blood count, blood culture, urea, creatinine and electrolytes (GRADE C).
An acute ultrasound scan is helpful in some clinical situations (GRADE D).
All children with cUTI should be reassessed for treatment response at 48 hours. If progress is atypical, consider complications and/or differential diagnosis (GRADE D).
Repeat urine testing is only needed if there is inadequate treatment response (GRADE D).

All children, irrespective of uUTI or cUTI, need urinary investigations to confirm UTI diagnosis – (Table 2). Key investigations and their interpretation are given below.

TABLE 2.
Summary of Diagnostic and Other Initial Investigations in Children With cUTI

As with uncomplicated UTI, clean catch urine collection is preferred due to its noninvasive nature, with catheterization or suprapubic aspiration being the gold standards if collection is difficult or diagnosis is uncertain. In infants under 2 months, clean catch methods are challenging and can result in up to 38% contaminated samples, so catheterization or suprapubic aspiration is advised. Up to 88% of specimens collected via a urine bag with a positive culture will be false positives, so they should only be used in nonurgent situations as an initial screening measure; a negative result confirms the absence of a UTI.

Urine Dipstick Analysis

If leukocyte esterase is greater than trace, pyuria is present. Dipsticks may be false negatives in children with < 3 months with high voiding frequency or with Enterococcus spp. or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These pathogens have a reduced ability to convert nitrate to nitrite, and Enterococcus spp. may not induce a strong inflammatory response to increase leukocyte esterase.– Dipsticks may be false positives due to contamination, fever of a different cause, localized or systemic inflammatory processes, for example, Kawasaki disease.

Urine Microscopy

Pyuria is present with ≥ 5 WBC/high-powered field with standardized or automated microscopy or ≥ 10 WBC/mm³ on a hemocytometer. Because of low sensitivity, negative urine microscopy does not exclude UTI.

Urine collection and transport for suspected urinary tract infection — handling and special populations are detailed with explicit directives. Skin cleansing is still generally recommended. Use of urine transport media with preservative or refrigeration immediately after collection decreases the proliferation of microorganisms, whereas urine samples that are delayed in processing and held at room temperature for extended periods of time (> 4hours) are likely to demonstrate moderate to large increases in colony counts that are misleading and, in the majority of cases, are not recommended for culture. Straight or "in-and-out" catheterization of a properly prepared patient usually provides a less contaminated specimen, and while urine samples collected via a midstream void or straight catheterization are preferred to optimize urine culture performance, some diagnostic testing, specifically NAAT for STI, requires a first voided sample for optimal performance. Culture from indwelling catheters is therefore strongly discouraged, and if culture is required the specimen should be taken from the sampling port of a newly inserted device that has been in place for < 48 hours. Cultures of Foley catheter tips and urine from the bag of a catheterized patient are of no clinical value and should be rejected, and bagged urine collections, primarily used for pediatric patients, should be strongly discouraged in favor of straight catheterization. For patients with stents or stones, culture of the removed stent or stone is appropriate, but results should be interpreted in the context of the pathogens identified, the method of device or stone removal, and other laboratory data, including urine culture. For chronic or recurrent UTI, urine culture conditions and interpretive and reporting criteria (ie, lower reporting thresholds) may require modifications, while expanded quantitative urine culture (EQUC) can recover additional potential urinary tract pathogens but data do not support routine use of these methods for all patient populations. Specimens obtained by more invasive means, such as cystoscope or suprapubic aspirations, are routinely cultured to allow for recovery of bacteria in concentrations as low as 1000 CFU/mL.

Culturing urine in febrile ICU patients with suspected UTI — For febrile ICU patients with pyuria and in whom urinary tract infection (UTI) is suspected, we recommend replacing the urinary catheter and obtaining urine cultures from the newly placed catheter (best-practice statement). The presence of urinary tract symptoms (if ascertainable)/signs and pyuria (defined as 5–10 WBC/hpf) on urinalysis should be used to justify urine culture. In those with urinary catheters, asymptomatic bacteriuria may result in false diagnoses of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI). In patients who are unable to attest to symptoms and have no other obvious source or suspicion of infection, the urinary catheter should be replaced. A urinalysis should be sent from a newly placed catheter and if WBCs are present, a urine culture should then be obtained.

### Management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a review… [^fd4bdc02]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Observations Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia causes metastatic infection in more than one-third of cases, including endocarditis, septic arthritis, vertebral osteomyelitis, spinal epidural abscess, psoas abscess, splenic abscess, septic pulmonary emboli, and seeding of implantable medical devices. Patients with S aureus bacteremia commonly present with fever or symptoms from metastatic infection, such as pain in the back, joints, abdomen or extremities, and/or change in mental status. Risk factors include intravascular devices such as implantable cardiac devices and dialysis vascular catheters, recent surgical procedures, injection drug use, diabetes, and previous S aureus infection. Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia is detected with blood cultures. Prolonged S aureus bacteremia is associated with a 90-day mortality risk of 39%.

All patients with S aureus bacteremia should undergo transthoracic echocardiography; transesophageal echocardiography should be performed in patients at high risk for endocarditis, such as those with persistent bacteremia, persistent fever, metastatic infection foci, or implantable cardiac devices. Other imaging modalities, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, should be performed based on symptoms and localizing signs of metastatic infection. Staphylococcus aureus is categorized as methicillin-susceptible or methicillin-resistant based on susceptibility to β-lactam antibiotics. Initial treatment for S aureus bacteremia typically includes antibiotics active against MRSA such as vancomycin or daptomycin. Once antibiotic susceptibility results are available, antibiotics should be adjusted. Cefazolin or antistaphylococcal penicillins should be used for MSSA and vancomycin, daptomycin, or ceftobiprole for MRSA.

Phase 3 trials for S aureus bacteremia demonstrated noninferiority of daptomycin to standard of care and noninferiority of ceftobiprole to daptomycin. Source control is a critical component of treating S aureus bacteremia and may include removal of infected intravascular or implanted devices, drainage of abscesses, and surgical debridement.

### Lower respiratory tract infection within sickle-cell adult patients with severe acute chest syndrome-the STAPHACS study [^97423da8]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is the most common acute pulmonary complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). It may progress to a life-threatening event requiring the use of mechanical ventilation, with a mortality rate ranging from 3%to 50% when acute respiratory distress syndrome develops. Lung infection may account for 30% of the aetiologies of ACS. The causal relationship between Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and ACS has been described for many years. However, this microorganism has been identified in only 4% of cases in the largest series published to date. To our knowledge, there is no specific study focusing on acute lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) associated with S. aureus in SCD adult patients with ACS, in the pneumococcal vaccine era. The objectives of this pilot study were to describe S. aureus LRTI in SCD patients with severe ACS, in terms of prevalence, clinical and laboratory findings and outcomes.

We conducted a retrospective observational study from April 2015 to December 2017 in SCD patients with ACS admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Tenon Hospital, Paris, France, a tertiary university hospital and referral center for SCD. The definition of ACS combined fever or chest pain and a new pulmonary infiltrate of at least one segment on thoracic imaging. ACS was considered to be associated with S. aureus (alone or associated with another microorganism) when respiratory tract samples or blood cultures yielded S. aureus, in the absence of any identifiable clinical source other than the lung. Patients with ACS associated with S. aureus (S. aureus group) were compared to patients with ACS in whom another microorganism was identified or in whom no microbiological documentation was obtained despite a comprehensive microbiological workup (control group). The workup included i) respiratory tract samplings (sputum, tracheal aspirate [TA], or bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL]) with Gram staining and quantitative culture for bacterial microorganisms; ii) blood cultures; iii) urinary antigen testing for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila. Additionally, a respiratory multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) test (FilmArrayTM Respiratory Panel system) has been available in our unit since 2016.

### Purple urine bag syndrome: a unique clinical case and management considerations [^6ae0b0f2]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnosing PUBS primarily involves identifying colored urine within drainage bags. However, it is essential to adopt an approach to determine its underlying cause effectively. Urinalysis plays a role in diagnosing PUBS by detecting pH levels, suggesting an alkaline urine environment conducive to the formation of indigo and indirubin. It is important to conduct urine culture and sensitivity tests to determine the pathogens responsible for the UTI, which helps confirm the diagnosis and aids in selecting appropriate antibiotics. Additionally, blood tests may be needed to evaluate reactions and identify any illnesses.

It is crucial to evaluate and perform laboratory investigations to rule out potential causes of urine discoloration, such as hematuria or the effects of certain medications. Clinical assessment is essential in identifying underlying tract abnormalities and UTIs. Recognizing these issues allows for an evaluation and timely administration of antibiotics, which can help prevent UTI progression and complications. When managing UTI-related urine discoloration, the focus should be on addressing the infection itself and optimizing catheter care. It is essential to use antibiotics that target bacteria-producing urease. Additionally, following catheter care practices, such as insertion, regular maintenance and timely changes can significantly reduce the risk of infection.

After reviewing existing research, it was found that the common bacteria associated with PUBS are Providencia stuartii, Providencia rettgeri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, various Proteus species, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus species, Morganella morganii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Occasionally, there have been reports of Citrobacter spp, Staphylococcus spp, Streptococcus spp. in cases of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus being linked to PUBS.

Recent studies suggest that PUBS is generally a condition that does not cause issues and often goes unnoticed. Therefore, experts recommend replacing the catheter and bag as the solution without resorting to antibiotics or extensive diagnostic procedures, such as urine cultures. These measures are typically reserved for patients with symptoms of underlying UTI. For individuals without symptoms, it is important to focus on treating the cause rather than just addressing the discoloration of the urine bag. In order to prevent PUBS recurrence, it is advisable to change drainage bags and using long-term indwelling catheters. Additionally, treating UTI-related urine discoloration usually leads to improvement within a day. This highlights the significance of monitoring symptoms and conducting urinalysis and urine cultures to track progress and evaluate treatment effectiveness.

### Blood culture use in the emergency department… [^a9d4bc56]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

CMS indicates Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services; ED, emergency department; JCAHO, Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations; UTI, urinary tract infection. Blood culture collection data were not recorded in the 2005 and 2006 surveys. In 2002, the JCAHO and CMS announced a core measure for routine blood culture collection in the ED for all patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia to benchmark the quality of care. © 2025 Routine blood cultures for all patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia have limited utility, and false-positive results lead to inappropriate antimicrobial use and longer hospital stays. 1 As a result, performance measures and practice guidelines that promoted obtaining blood cultures in all such patients were modified from 2005 through 2007 to recommend routine collection in only the sickest patients.

1, 2 Using a national sample of emergency department visits, we examined patterns of obtaining cultures in adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. We included all visits by patients 18 years or older with community-acquired pneumonia who were subsequently hospitalized. Blood culture collection during the visit was recorded as a checkbox on the NHAMCS data collection form. As a control group, we examined the trend in collecting cultures in patients hospitalized for a urinary tract infection, a diagnosis with no change in recommendations during the study period. In contrast, culture rates for urinary tract infection remained stable, with a substantial difference in culture use between the 2 conditions over time.

In multivariable analysis, disease severity did not predict culture collection, and admission to the intensive care unit was associated with a lower odds of obtaining cultures. Several nonclinical factors were strong predictors, including hospital ownership and region. The appropriate use of cultures could reduce potential harms from inappropriate antibiotic use and longer hospital stays, 6 as well as decrease the summative cost of the test itself. 7 Further attention is warranted to the judicious use of blood cultures in the management of pneumonia.

### Procalcitonin levels in bloodstream infections caused by different sources and species of bacteria [^4a712422]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to evaluate procalcitonin (PCT) diagnostic accuracy in discriminating gram-negative (GN) from gram-positive (GP) bloodstream infections and determining the relationship between PCT levels, infection sites, and pathogen types.

Methods

Clinical and laboratory data were collected from patients with blood culture (BC)-positive sepsis between January 2014 and December 2015. PCT levels at different infection sites were compared, as was the presence of GN and GP bloodstream infection. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated to assess diagnostic accuracy.

Results

Of the 486 monomicrobial BCs, 254 (52.26%) were positive for GN bacteria (GNB), and 202 (42.18%) for GP bacteria (GPB). Median PCT levels were higher in BCs positive for GN (2.42ng/ml, IQR: 0.38–15.52) than in those positive for GPB (0.49ng/ml, IQR: 0.13–5.89) (P < 0.001). In the ROC analysis to differentiate between GNB and GPB, the area under the curve was 0.628 (95% CI: 0.576–0.679). When the cutoffs for PCT were 10.335 and 15.000ng/ml, the specificity of GNB infection was 80.2% and 84.2%, respectively. PCT levels caused by GNB differed between Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumanni/Burkholderia cepacia, Klebsiella pneumonia and Acinetobacter baumanni. PCT levels caused by GPB differed between Staphylococcus epidermidis/Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus hominis/Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis/S.hominis/S. haemolyticus. Among patients with known infection sites, there were statistical differences in PCT levels between abdominal infection and pneumonia/infective endocarditis, urinary tract infection and pneumonia/catheter-related infection/infective endocarditis.

Conclusion

PCT can distinguish between GNB and GPB infection, as well as between different bacterial species and infection sites.

### Redefining Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a structured approach guiding diagnostic and therapeutic management [^3f63c597]. The Journal of Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Need for a new classification

Clinicians need a classification for SAB that directs the diagnostic work-up and individualizes antibiotic treatment (Fig. 1). This framework can also be used to identify knowledge gaps for future research (Table 1). This proposed classification system begins after the initial positive blood culture with a requisite evaluation for every patient with SAB, including physical examination, repeat blood cultures, and echocardiography. Risk stratification based upon these results could then define patients at high or low risk of metastatic infection. Patients identified as high risk for complications could then undergo a more extensive diagnostic work-up to find or exclude these complications, in contrast to the patient without risk factors present at baseline or with negative results from the initial work-up ('low-risk SAB'). Ideally, the result of the more in-depth diagnostic work-up would delineate the extent and nature of the patient's S. aureus infection. This 'final clinical diagnosis', and not a designation of complicated SAB solely on the basis of the presence of factors that are associated with metastatic infections, would correspond with a certain treatment strategy for the average patients with this clinical picture, including route of administration, duration, and load reduction. The last step is to establish the final treatment plan for the individual patient by further streamlining or changing duration of the treatment based on clinical factors. Of course, for this classification to work in clinical decision making, it must be able to accurately identify the absence of metastatic infections in patients with SAB, even when traditional evaluations fail to identify one.

### Proposed primary endpoints for use in clinical trials that compare treatment options for bloodstream infection in adults: a consensus definition [^407e4037]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To define standardized endpoints to aid the design of trials that compare antibiotic therapies for bloodstream infections (BSI).

Methods

Prospective studies, randomized trials or registered protocols comparing antibiotic therapies for BSI, published from 2005 to 2016, were reviewed. Consensus endpoints for BSI studies were defined using a modified Delphi process.

Results

Different primary and secondary endpoints were defined for pilot (small-scale studies designed to evaluate protocol design, feasibility and implementation) and definitive trials (larger-scale studies designed to test hypotheses and influence clinical practice), as well as for Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative BSI. For pilot studies of S. aureus BSI, a primary outcome of success at day 7 was defined by: survival, resolution of fever, stable/improved Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and clearance of blood cultures, with no microbiologically confirmed failure up to 90 days. For definitive S. aureus BSI studies, a primary outcome of success at 90 days was defined by survival and no microbiologically confirmed failure. For pilot studies of Gram-negative BSI, a primary outcome of success at day 7 was defined by: survival, resolution of fever and symptoms related to BSI source, stable or improved SOFA score and negative blood cultures. For definitive Gram-negative BSI studies, a primary outcome of survival at 90 days supported by a secondary outcome of success at day 7 (as previously defined) was agreed.

Conclusions

These endpoints provide a framework to aid future trial design. Further work will be required to validate these endpoints with respect to patient-centred clinical outcomes.

This study included a sample of adult patients admitted to nonintensive care unit settings in HMS hospitals with a positive urine culture between July 1, 2017, and June 30, 2022. Patients were consecutively reviewed with the first patient included daily. Patients were ineligible for inclusion if they met any of the following criteria: (1) age younger than 18 years; (2) pregnant and/or breastfeeding; (3) altered urinary tract anatomy, urologic surgery during hospitalization, or urinary stent or nephrostomy tube in place during hospitalization; (4) intensive care unit admission within 3 days before or after urine culture; (5) under hospice care on admission; (6) patient directed discharge; (7) concomitant infection (abstractors excluded any patient with documented antibiotic treatment for a concomitant bacterial infection during the hospital encounter unless the infection was potentially related to the UTI [eg, bacteremia, CDI]); (8) active treatment and/or prophylaxis for UTI on admission; (9) solid organ or bone marrow transplant recipient; (10) HIV with CD4 count less than 200 cells/mm 3; (11) neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 0.5 cells/μL on hospital day 1 or 2); or (12) within the 30 days after discharge from index hospitalization already abstracted for that patient.

For this study, patients were excluded if they had specific signs or symptoms of a UTI defined per IDSA ASB guidelines, (Box). Patients with isolated candiduria and Staphylococcus aureus bacteriuria were also excluded as candiduria frequently represents colonization or contamination, and Staphylococcus aureus in urine usually represent hematogenous spread, (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1).

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^465e300c]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Urine specimen collection and bag limitations — Many clinicians think that a urine collection bag affixed to the perineum has a low contamination rate if the patient's perineum is properly cleansed and rinsed before application, the bag is removed promptly after voiding, and the specimen is refrigerated or processed immediately; however, a "positive" culture result from a specimen collected in a bag cannot be used to document a UTI and confirmation requires culture of a specimen collected through catheterization or SPA, so many clinicians prefer to obtain a definitive urine specimen through catheterization initially.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^f1779365]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Table 2 — suspected sepsis antibiotics: out-of-hospital evidence is insufficient to make a recommendation; in the emergency department, we recommend prompt administration, reserving very short time thresholds for those with infection and shock given insufficient data to specify a threshold, administer broad-spectrum therapy when the source is unconfirmed based on local susceptibility, and target therapy to identified sources such as pneumonia or UTI per source-specific guidelines.

### Outpatient management of fever and neutropenia in adults treated for malignancy: American Society of Clinical Oncology and Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guideline update [^9c7b43d4]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for febrile neutropenia, more specifically with respect to microbiological cultures, ASCO 2018 guidelines recommend to obtain cultures from other sites (such as urine, lower respiratory tract, CSF, stool, or wounds) as clinically indicated.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^6d8b22e6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is a common finding in many populations, including healthy women and persons with underlying urologic abnormalities. The 2005 guideline from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommended that ASB should be screened for and treated only in pregnant women or in an individual prior to undergoing invasive urologic procedures. Treatment was not recommended for healthy women; older women or men; or persons with diabetes, indwelling catheters, or spinal cord injury. The guideline did not address children and some adult populations, including patients with neutropenia, solid organ transplants, and nonurologic surgery. In the years since the publication of the guideline, further information relevant to ASB has become available. In addition, antimicrobial treatment of ASB has been recognized as an important contributor to inappropriate antimicrobial use, which promotes emergence of antimicrobial resistance. The current guideline updates the recommendations of the 2005 guideline, includes new recommendations for populations not previously addressed, and, where relevant, addresses the interpretation of nonlocalizing clinical symptoms in populations with a high prevalence of ASB.
