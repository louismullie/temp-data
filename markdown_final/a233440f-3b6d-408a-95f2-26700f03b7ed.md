## Question

How is rhythmic music used for treating Parkinson's disease patients

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how rhythmic music is used to treat Parkinson's disease, including mechanisms, evidence, delivery formats, individualization, safety, and practical implementation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology of PD gait and timing deficits. Then, I should verify the neurophysiological rationale for rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS). Next, I will review the clinical evidence across modalities, followed by an appraisal of individual variability and predictors of response. After that, I need to examine delivery formats, including closed-loop systems and group interventions. I will then consider safety, dual-task effects, and fall risk. Finally, I should synthesize practical clinical guidance and highlight gaps and future directions, ensuring each claim is supported by appropriate citations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem we are trying to address. In PD, basal ganglia dysfunction disrupts internal timing and automaticity, producing bradykinesia, shortened stride length, increased stride-to-stride variability, and freezing of gait, with gait variability serving as a marker of disability and disease severity; these deficits are often refractory to dopaminergic therapy, underscoring the need for non-pharmacological strategies that restore timing and rhythmicity [^116vDr4Q] [^112Syw49] [^113TdVu2].

> Now, I need to check the mechanistic rationale for RAS. External rhythmic cues can entrain motor output by engaging cerebello–thalamo–cortical circuits that bypass impaired basal ganglia timing, while also modulating attention and arousal. Neuroimaging work shows abnormal phasic activation patterns in salience, motor, and basal ganglia networks during rhythm perception in PD, supporting the idea that RAS may normalize aberrant network dynamics and facilitate movement initiation and maintenance [^114G8mR3] [^115aB9VT] [^117C15tf].

> Next, I should review the strength of evidence for RAS on gait. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and consistency. Meta-analytic and systematic reviews indicate significant improvements in walking velocity, stride length, and motor function with music-based movement therapy and RAS, with effect sizes around 0.18–0.20 m/s for velocity and clinically meaningful gains in balance and motor scores; randomized trials also show RAS reduces falls in fall-prone PD cohorts, reinforcing its clinical relevance beyond laboratory settings [^112HwHhb] [^115JoV7i] [^112HwHhb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universality. I should double-check individual variability. About half of patients show a positive response to cueing, while a subset worsens, often due to poor beat perception or dual-task interference. Musically trained individuals and those with better perceptual abilities are more likely to benefit, whereas those with higher baseline gait performance may have less room for improvement and can exhibit deleterious effects under cueing, emphasizing the need for patient selection and tempo calibration [^113ByTry] [^112EoSua] [^112RtxuQ].

> I will now examine delivery formats, starting with closed-loop, music-based RAS. Autonomous systems like MR-005 personalize tempo progression to real-time gait metrics, amplify moderate-to-vigorous walking, increase daily steps by clinically meaningful margins, and reduce stride time variability during uncued walking, suggesting motor learning. Benefits dissipate upon device withdrawal, indicating the cue itself is a key contextual driver of behavior and gait quality [^111aywkU] [^11713faM] [^112mjjPn].

> Let me consider adaptive phase-synchronized music as well. BeatMove aligns music tempo and beat phase to the user's cadence in real time, achieving faster and more stable walking patterns even in patients with impaired rhythmic skills. Preliminary data suggest substantial gains in comfortable walking speed, likely reflecting both motivational and entrainment effects, though larger randomized trials are needed to confirm durability and generalizability [^116ZAaas] [^1126tjkk].

> Next, I should review group-based music interventions. Group therapeutic singing acutely improves speech and facial expression and may modestly improve global motor scores, while structured group programs like the Ronnie Gardiner Method enhance mood, alertness, and perceived quality of life, though objective motor gains are inconsistent. These programs likely leverage social connectedness, enjoyment, and rhythmic multitasking to augment engagement and adherence [^117WRwFE] [^111P7W4N] [^1178MGJR].

> But wait, what about safety and dual-task effects? I need to ensure we do not overgeneralize. In constrained environments, concurrent music does not necessarily impair obstacle avoidance, but in dual-task settings, PD gait can deteriorate with music, particularly when attention is diverted. Thus, cue selection, task complexity, and environment must be individualized, and patients with freezing may require slower cue frequencies to avoid destabilization [^115zFtQs] [^115BuTu5] [^1124hNxa].

> I should confirm practical clinical guidance. Pre-assessment of beat perception and synchronization capacity helps identify likely responders; preferred, high-groove music enhances adherence via reward engagement; tempo is typically set near the individual's cadence with small upward progressions to avoid dual-task overload; and combining RAS with medication optimization, balance training, and assistive devices yields additive benefits in real-world mobility, aligning with personalized rehabilitation frameworks [^113A9W3H] [^113ByTry] [^112Syw49].

> Let me reconsider limitations and future directions so I do not overstate conclusions. Evidence quality varies, with many studies small and short-term; durability beyond 8 weeks is uncertain, and access to closed-loop devices remains limited; future work should prioritize larger RCTs with extended follow-up, head-to-head comparisons of cue modalities, and integration of neuroimaging to link behavioral gains to network plasticity, while developing scalable, home-based delivery models [^115JoV7i] [^111aywkU] [^1119H3UP].

> In summary, rhythmic music treats PD by externally scaffolding impaired internal timing through auditory-motor entrainment, engaging compensatory cerebellar and cortical circuits, and enhancing motivation and adherence. Clinically meaningful improvements in gait speed, stride length, variability, and falls are achievable when interventions are appropriately selected, calibrated, and sustained, but benefits are heterogeneous and require individualized implementation and, in many cases, ongoing access to cueing to maintain effects [^114G8mR3] [^115JoV7i] [^112HwHhb].

Rhythmic music is used in Parkinson's disease to **improve gait and reduce freezing** via rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) [^115JoV7i], which entrains motor timing and bypasses basal ganglia deficits [^114G8mR3]. RAS increases **gait speed and stride length** [^115JoV7i] and reduces variability and freezing [^116vDr4Q] [^115JoV7i], with benefits lasting weeks after training [^111oyxW6]. Individual response varies with rhythmic ability and musical training [^113ByTry]; **personalized, closed-loop systems** [^111aywkU] and group music interventions [^111P7W4N] enhance adherence and outcomes. Music is safe, enjoyable, and cost-effective, making it a practical adjunct to standard care [^114VopxG] [^116JC68h].

---

## Mechanisms of action

Rhythmic music engages **auditory-motor entrainment**, aligning movement timing with external beats and compensating for impaired internal timing in PD [^114G8mR3]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Auditory-motor entrainment**: External rhythms activate cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuits, bypassing basal ganglia dysfunction to stabilize gait timing [^114G8mR3] [^114nWCwr].

- **Dopaminergic modulation**: Music activates reward circuits, increasing motivation and engagement via dopamine release [^112fSG1N].

- **Attentional focus**: Rhythmic cues direct attention to gait, reducing freezing and improving movement initiation [^116jxr1N].

---

## Clinical evidence of benefit

Multiple studies and meta-analyses show **significant improvements** in motor symptoms with rhythmic music:

| **Outcome measure** | **Evidence of improvement** |
|-|-|
| Gait speed | Significant increases in walking speed with RAS [^114NHQDb] [^115JoV7i] |
| Stride length | Improved stride length and reduced variability [^112HwHhb] [^112mjjPn] |
| Freezing of gait | Reduced frequency and duration of freezing episodes [^115JoV7i] [^111oyxW6] |
| Balance and motor function | Improved balance, motor scores, and quality of life with music-based movement therapy [^115JoV7i] [^113HxzTa] |

---

## Individual variability and personalization

Response to rhythmic music varies with **rhythmic ability**, musical training, and cognitive function [^113ByTry]. Patients with better beat perception and musical training benefit more, whereas those with poor rhythmic skills may experience minimal or negative effects [^112RtxuQ]. Personalization — tailoring tempo, genre, and delivery — improves outcomes and adherence [^113A9W3H] [^111aywkU].

---

## Delivery methods and settings

Rhythmic music is delivered in several ways:

- **Closed-loop RAS systems**: Real-time, adaptive systems (e.g. MR-005) personalize cues to gait, improving adherence and outcomes [^111aywkU] [^112M9FaR].

- **Group interventions**: Group singing and music therapy improve mood, social connection, and motor symptoms [^111P7W4N] [^1178MGJR].

- **Home-based programs**: Portable devices and apps enable convenient, sustained use [^11746m7u].

---

## Safety considerations and limitations

Rhythmic music is generally safe, but some patients may experience **dual-task interference** or worsened gait in complex environments [^115BuTu5]. Careful selection, personalization, and monitoring mitigate risks [^113ByTry].

---

## Integration with standard care

Rhythmic music complements standard care by addressing gait and freezing that are only partially responsive to medication [^112Syw49]. It is best integrated as part of a **multidisciplinary approach**, including medication, physical therapy, and occupational therapy [^1165xGeh].

---

## Long-term adherence and sustainability

Adherence is enhanced by enjoyment, social interaction, and perceived benefit [^114nWCwr]. Sustained use of rhythmic music interventions can maintain **gains in gait and quality of life**, though long-term durability varies and may require ongoing support [^112c2TWM] [^115iDZJ3].

---

## Cost-effectiveness and accessibility

Rhythmic music interventions are **cost-effective and accessible**, requiring minimal equipment and offering scalable delivery via digital platforms and community programs [^112M9FaR].

---

Rhythmic music is a **valuable adjunct** in Parkinson's disease, improving gait, reducing freezing, and enhancing quality of life through mechanisms such as auditory-motor entrainment and dopaminergic modulation. Personalization and integration with standard care optimize outcomes, and adherence is supported by enjoyment and social engagement [^115JoV7i].

### Rhythmic abilities and musical training in Parkinson's disease: do they help? [^1127FinT]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Rhythmic auditory cues can immediately improve gait in Parkinson's disease. However, this effect varies considerably across patients. The factors associated with this individual variability are not known to date. Patients' rhythmic abilities and musicality (e.g. perceptual and singing abilities, emotional response to music, and musical training) may foster a positive response to rhythmic cues. To examine this hypothesis, we measured gait at baseline and with rhythmic cues in 39 non-demented patients with Parkinson's disease and 39 matched healthy controls. Cognition, rhythmic abilities and general musicality were assessed. A response to cueing was qualified as positive when the stimulation led to a clinically meaningful increase in gait speed. We observed that patients with positive response to cueing (n = 17) were more musically trained, aligned more often their steps to the rhythmic cues while walking, and showed better music perception as well as poorer cognitive flexibility than patients with non-positive response (n = 22). Gait performance with rhythmic cues worsened in six patients. We concluded that rhythmic and musical skills, which can be modulated by musical training, may increase beneficial effects of rhythmic auditory cueing in Parkinson's disease. Screening patients in terms of musical/rhythmic abilities and musical training may allow teasing apart patients who are likely to benefit from cueing from those who may worsen their performance due to the stimulation.

### Do metronomes improve the quality of life in people with Parkinson's disease? A pragmatic, single-blind, randomized cross-over trial [^113A1c4V]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of acoustic cueing using metronomes on the quality of life of people with moderate to severe Parkinson's disease.

Study Design

Pragmatic, single-blind, randomized cross-over trial.

Participants

Forty-two people aged 50–85 years, in Hoehn and Yahr stage II-IV and on stable medication. Eight were lost to follow-up.

Intervention

Participants were randomized using concealed allocation to either an early group (n = 21) to receive an electronic metronome without therapy but limited support (5–10 minutes instruction and on-demand telephone assistance) for four weeks, or a late group (n = 21) to receive the same intervention at 10 weeks. In both groups the beat frequency was initially set to be comfortable for walking.

Outcomes Measures

Primary and secondary outcomes were measured at baseline, 4, 10 and 14 weeks using the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire 39 (PDQ-39), the Short Form 36 version 2 (SF-36 version 2) and a falls diary.

Results

There were positive effects in six domains of the SF-36 version 2 and eight domains of the PDQ-39, although only one mean difference was clinically important: the role limitation (emotional) domain of SF-36 version 2 (a mean difference of 3.77, 95% confidence interval (CI), -2.68 to 10.22), a secondary outcome. None of these changes were statistically significant. There were no statistically significant differences in falls rates over the study period. Ten participants (24%) wanted to continue with their metronomes at the end of the study.

Conclusion

To demonstrate metronomes are beneficial on the role limitation domain of the SF-36 version 2 in people with moderate to severe Parkinson's disease a sample size of 600 would be required.

### Stress and mindfulness in Parkinson's disease-a survey in 5000 patients [^116AjVmh]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients perceived a positive effect of mindfulness on their symptoms. Those who practiced mindfulness experienced improvement due to mindfulness for all reported symptoms (Fig. 3b), when comparing the effect against a score of 5 (no change): tremor (MD = 0.89, [95% CI 0.79–0.98]), gait (MD = 0.61, [95% CI 0.52–0.70]), slowness of movement (MD = 0.39, [95% CI 0.31–0.47]), dyskinesia (MD = 0.35, [95% CI 0.25–0.45]), depressed mood (MD = 1.03, [95% CI 0.93–1.13]), anxiety (MD = 1.04, [95% CI 0.94–1.14]), and sleeping problems (MD = 0.60, [95% CI 0.50–0.70]). All changes were significant (p < 0.0071 corrected). Again, an MD of −2.0 would indicate a mean score of 3.0 on the 9-point scale used for this question, where 1 stood for 'symptom worsens a lot' and 9 stood for 'symptom improves a lot'. Highest effects were seen for depression and anxiety, for which, respectively, 60.2% and 64.7% noticed improvement (scores higher than 5). Interestingly, when dividing mindfulness users according to how often they reported to practice mindfulness, we showed that there is a positive correlation between the frequency of mindfulness use and the perceived improvement on Parkinson's symptoms (Fig. 3c). People who did not practice mindfulness had various reasons for this (Fig. 3d). The most frequent response, chosen by 748 of 1736 PD responders (43.4%), was that they never thought about the option of doing mindfulness, but would be interested.

If applicable, patients could complete other strategies they had to reduce stress in free text fields. Frequently mentioned were religion (reading the bible or praying) (n = 265), music (listening to music, singing, or playing musical instruments) (n = 150), reading (n = 82), art/creativity (n = 80), anxiolytic/antidepressant medication (n = 75), and looking for social support (meeting or talking with friends/family) (n = 74).

### Biological principles for music and mental health [^112xeSPj]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Applications of rhythm in mental health

So far, the clinical value of NRT has mainly been studied in the context of music therapies aimed at improving sensory and motor functions (including speech). However, even in these contexts, mental health benefits are often apparent. For example, in a 2021 meta-analysis of 17 randomized controlled studies testing musical interventions in Parkinson's disease, a sub-analysis of 8 studies with mental health measures found significant benefits for mood, motivation, and emotional well-being in music conditions compared to standard care (SMD = 0.38, N = 273 patients). Positive mental health outcomes have also been observed in response to receptive music therapy after stroke. For example, one widely-cited study found that listening to music for at least one hour per day over a two-month period significantly lowered self-reported depression at 3 months post-stroke, as compared to standard medical care and rehabilitation. Intriguingly, this study also reported benefits of music listening for cognitive function (memory and attention) in a well-controlled comparison to audio-book listening.

The capacity of rhythm to entrain activity in broad auditory-motor networks and simultaneously increase positive affect can also be hypothesized to account for a significant proportion of the benefits of musical treatments for anxiety and depression (see Section "Applications of tonality in mental health"). Specifically, engaging these networks with high-groove rhythms may provide an efficient way to disrupt maladaptive patterns of brain activity associated with negative affect and self-focused negative rumination. Related to this hypothesis, there is growing evidence that groove is important for understanding the effects of music on cognition, particularly in the context of repetitive effortful work, which can often generate negative affect. For example, in one recent study, listening to a high-groove drum loop for just 3 min was found to be more effective than noise at improving performance on a subsequent repetitive behavioral task measuring context-dependent response inhibition (a "Stroop" test). This effect of rhythm was specific to participants who reported enjoying the drum loop and its groove. These participants also exhibited significantly greater (dorsolateral) prefrontal cortical activity during the Stroop test in the drum-loop condition, as measured using functional Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy.

### Conceptualizing how group singing may enhance quality of life with Parkinson's disease [^1126niHw]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2014). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Abstract Purpose: Group singing could be a promising component of neurorehabilitative care. This article aims to conceptualize how group singing may enable people with Parkinson's disease (PD) to synchronize their movement patterns to musical rhythm and enhance quality of life.

Method

Spanning the medical and social sciences, the article draws conceptually on literature on PD, group singing and rhythm in music; personal experience; and reasoning.

Results

Conceptualizing PD in terms of disruptions to social and biological rhythms, we hypothesize how group singing may produce two socio-psychological states - connectedness and flow - that may entrain rhythm in people with PD. The states connect during group singing to elicit and enhance motor processes but may also reawaken after the group singing, through the recall and reactivation of the musical rhythms encoded during group singing.

Conclusions

In people with PD, this continuity of flow is hypothesized to be conducive to rhythmic entrainment during and after group singing and in turn to reduced deficits in motor timing and emotional processing, and improvements in quality of life. Empirical studies are needed to test this hypothesis in people with movement disorders such as PD. Implications for Rehabilitation Musical rhythm in group singing may enhance quality of life, and rehabilitation, in people with PD. Use group singing to produce two socio-psychological states - connectedness and flow - that may yield these health benefits. Include people with PD in singing groups to facilitate perceptual exposure to familiar music with melodic distinctiveness and a regular beat.

### Abnormal phasic activity in saliency network, motor areas, and basal ganglia in Parkinson's disease during rhythm perception [^117C15tf]. Human Brain Mapping (2019). Medium credibility.

Behavioral studies indicate that persons with Parkinson's disease have complexity dependent problems with the discrimination of auditory rhythms. Furthermore, neuroimaging studies show that rhythm processing activates many brain areas that overlap with areas affected by Parkinson's disease (PD). This study sought to investigate the neural correlates of rhythm processing in PD and healthy controls, with a particular focus on rhythmic complexity. We further aimed to investigate differences in brain activation during initial phases of rhythm processing. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to scan 15 persons with Parkinson's disease and 15 healthy controls while they listened to musical rhythms with two different levels of complexity. Rhythmic complexity had no significant effect on brain activations, but patients and controls showed differences in areas related to temporal auditory processing, notably bilateral planum temporale and inferior parietal lobule. We found indications of a particular sequential or phasic activation pattern of brain activity, where activity in caudate nucleus in the basal ganglia was time-displaced by activation in the saliency network-comprised of anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral anterior insula-and cortical and subcortical motor areas, during the initial phases of listening to rhythms. We relate our findings to core PD pathology, and discuss the overall, rhythm processing related hyperactivity in PD as a possible dysfunction in specific basal ganglia mechanisms, and the phasic activation pattern in PD as a reflection of a lack of preparatory activation of task-relevant brain networks for rhythm processing in PD.

### How often does music and rhythm improve patients' perception of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease? [^113sVzU9]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Of the clinic patients, 46 (92%) reported normal hearing and 47/50 (94%) enjoyed listening to music. Sixteen out of 50 (32%) had formal musical training (average 5 years). Previous dance training was less frequent (10/50, 20%) and of a shorter duration (average 3.2 years).

The entire clinic sample (100%) reported no change in their PD symptoms when listening to music, although 32/50 (64%) reported pleasant calm feelings. Therefore, despite the common benefit of experience relaxation while listening to music, there were surprisingly no perceived improvements in PD symptoms in this randomly selected cohort of patients.

Of the choir sample, four patients (50%) had received musical training (average 5.2 years) and none had previous dance training. Apart from pleasure and a rewarding effect (in 7/8 patients), six patients reported no subjective beneficial effects from listening to music on their Parkinsonian symptoms. Two patients reported a general amelioration of their symptoms with a reduction of tremor.

This study provides preliminary evidence that a subjective beneficial effect of music on PD symptoms is uncommon. Although there is evidence for music stimulation as a potential therapy from clinical and neuroimaging studies, it appears that patients with mild to moderate PD are often not aware of any significant effects on their motor function from listening to music. This largely negative result could be due to the insensitivity of our questionnaire, or it may be that the lack of such a subjective benefit is due to poor memory or awareness of actual benefits. Contributing factors may be the cognitive deficits that can arise even in early stages of PD, or inaccurate perception of movement.

Our data do not of course indicate a lack of objective benefit of music on motor signs. However, the low rate of positive responses (2/58 patients) poses a challenge for therapeutic studies. Music and rhythm therapies may need to train subjects to be more aware of their own state, or to target therapies at the subgroup of patients who have experienced musical benefit.

### Nonpharmacological treatments for patients with Parkinson's disease [^1165xGeh]. Movement Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Since 2013, a number of studies have enhanced the literature and have guided clinicians on viable treatment interventions outside of pharmacotherapy and surgery. Thirty-three randomized controlled trials and one large observational study on exercise and physiotherapy were published in this period. Four randomized controlled trials focused on dance interventions, eight on treatment of cognition and behavior, two on occupational therapy, and two on speech and language therapy (the latter two specifically addressed dysphagia). Three randomized controlled trials focused on multidisciplinary care models, one study on telemedicine, and four studies on alternative interventions, including music therapy and mindfulness. These studies attest to the marked interest in these therapeutic approaches and the increasing evidence base that places nonpharmacological treatments firmly within the integrated repertoire of treatment options in Parkinson's disease.

### Group-based music intervention in Parkinson's disease-findings from a mixed-methods study [^113KFz6Y]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

The first theme describes the expectations versus the results, and two categories explain the content. The category 'Anticipations' describes how most patients anticipated that the music would engage them, and how the therapists anticipated that the patients would get more out of it if the training was experienced as enjoyable. The category 'Experienced effects' highlights perceptions of training effects. Generally, the training was perceived as energizing; that the brain 'perked up'. Patients described feelings of improved posture and dexterity with less tremor, a smoother body, improved mood and being more cheerful, and improved endurance with better ability to concentrate. The training gave transfer effects on everyday living. Lack of training effects were also reflected upon: ' The tests will ultimately reveal whether there were any effects ' (Group 2). The therapists noted subtle changes such as improved mood, endurance, a better ability to stay focused, and movement timing. The patients' symptoms fluctuated, which made it difficult to observe effects.

The second theme describes perspectives on the treatment contents, and two categories explain the content. The category 'The therapy itself' illuminates how patients agreed that the therapy was something out of the ordinary, but the 'nonsense-words' were hard to learn. The training was easygoing, positive, and fun: 'It's a winning concept! It's a combination of the programme itself, the rhythm of the music, the fellowship, and the enthusiastic leaders'. 'Yes, the programme is so much fun that you become exhilarated'. 'I agree, there is a lot of physical activity for one hour, and this gives you endorphins, and that is the "joy substance" of the body'. 'Yes, and there is much memory training' (Group 5). To coordinate arms and legs and say the correct words was a real challenge. When the concentration was broken, one was lost. The therapists observed that the patients prioritized the movements, while the words were lost. The patients needed much visual support, that is, the therapist pointed at the note system. This meant that the therapists were unable to observe the participants at all times. Therefore, for safety reasons, it was experienced as advantageous to have two instructors.

### Feasibility of external rhythmic cueing with the google glass for improving gait in people with Parkinson's disease [^115UsYFz]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

New mobile technologies like smartglasses can deliver external cues that may improve gait in people with Parkinson's disease in their natural environment. However, the potential of these devices must first be assessed in controlled experiments. Therefore, we evaluated rhythmic visual and auditory cueing in a laboratory setting with a custom-made application for the Google Glass. Twelve participants (mean age = 66.8; mean disease duration = 13.6 years) were tested at end of dose. We compared several key gait parameters (walking speed, cadence, stride length, and stride length variability) and freezing of gait for three types of external cues (metronome, flashing light, and optic flow) and a control condition (no-cue). For all cueing conditions, the subjects completed several walking tasks of varying complexity. Seven inertial sensors attached to the feet, legs and pelvis captured motion data for gait analysis. Two experienced raters scored the presence and severity of freezing of gait using video recordings. User experience was evaluated through a semi-open interview. During cueing, a more stable gait pattern emerged, particularly on complicated walking courses; however, freezing of gait did not significantly decrease. The metronome was more effective than rhythmic visual cues and most preferred by the participants. Participants were overall positive about the usability of the Google Glass and willing to use it at home. Thus, smartglasses like the Google Glass could be used to provide personalized mobile cueing to support gait; however, in its current form, auditory cues seemed more effective than rhythmic visual cues.

### Rhythmic auditory cueing to improve walking in patients with neurological conditions other than Parkinson's disease – what is the evidence? [^116UBRg8]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate whether synchronising over-ground walking to rhythmic auditory cues improves temporal and spatial gait measures in adults with neurological clinical conditions other than Parkinson's disease.

Method

A search was performed in June 2011 using the computerised databases AGELINE, AMED, AMI, CINAHL, Current Contents, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and PUBMED, and extended using hand-searching of relevant journals and article reference lists. Methodological quality was independently assessed by two reviewers. A best evidence synthesis was applied to rate levels of evidence.

Results

Fourteen studies, four of which were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), met the inclusion criteria. Patient groups included those with stroke (six studies); Huntington's disease and spinal cord injury (two studies each); traumatic brain injury, dementia, multiple sclerosis and normal pressure hydrocephalus (one study each). The best evidence synthesis found moderate evidence of improved velocity and stride length of people with stroke following gait training with rhythmic music. Insufficient evidence was found for other included neurological disorders due to low study numbers and poor methodological quality of some studies.

Conclusion

Synchronising walking to rhythmic auditory cues can result in short-term improvement in gait measures of people with stroke. Further high quality studies are needed before recommendations for clinical practice can be made.

### Music-based interventions in neurological rehabilitation [^114XJJQc]. The Lancet: Neurology (2017). Medium credibility.

During the past ten years, an increasing number of controlled studies have assessed the potential rehabilitative effects of music-based interventions, such as music listening, singing, or playing an instrument, in several neurological diseases. Although the number of studies and extent of available evidence is greatest in stroke and dementia, there is also evidence for the effects of music-based interventions on supporting cognition, motor function, or emotional wellbeing in people with Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, or multiple sclerosis. Music-based interventions can affect divergent functions such as motor performance, speech, or cognition in these patient groups. However, the psychological effects and neurobiological mechanisms underlying the effects of music interventions are likely to share common neural systems for reward, arousal, affect regulation, learning, and activity-driven plasticity. Although further controlled studies are needed to establish the efficacy of music in neurological recovery, music-based interventions are emerging as promising rehabilitation strategies.

### Amplifying walking activity in Parkinson's disease through autonomous music-based rhythmic auditory stimulation: randomized controlled trial [^114p9FhD]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Our research group recently investigated the feasibility and proof-of-concept of delivering a real-world walking intervention via an autonomous, closed-loop, music-based digital RAS system (MR-005, MedRhythms, Inc, Portland, ME, USA) designed for people with PD. The results from the single-arm pilot study provided preliminary evidence supporting the potential benefits of the intervention for improving both real-world walking and gait quality during RAS-cued conditions. Approaches in adopting behaviors associated with new interventions such as community-based walking with autonomous RAS include identifying and targeting modifiable determinants of action. Habits, as defined in psychology, are behavior patterns that are learned through context-dependent repetition. That is, through repeated performance, the link between context and behavior is reinforced leading to more automatic habitual responses. The cue-enriched delivery of music-based RAS has potential for harnessing habits for walking, which could be advantageous in promoting regular and sustainable walking regimens. Habit formation during adoption of new walking regimens has not been examined in PD.

### Rhythmic abilities and musical training in Parkinson's disease: do they help? [^112EoSua]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Gait parameters

Patients and controls both engaged in the task as shown by the increase of cadence in both groups. This effect was however more apparent in participants with a PR to cueing than in those with a NPR (F (1,74) = 6.01, p < 0.05; Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Spatio-temporal gait parameters in patients with Parkinson's diseaseand controls at baseline and with cueing. Participants are divided into two categories depending on their response to cueing (positive vs. non-positive). In patients with positive response speed and stride length improved while in patients with non-positive response both worsened. Error bars indicate standard deviation

As expected, patients and controls with PR improved significantly their gait speed with cueing. The improvement in patients with PR was such (+19% relative to the baseline), that they reached the speed of controls at baseline (1.26 m/s, for the overall group, t < 1). Gait speed at baseline in patients and controls with PR was lower than in participants with NPR to cueing. Participants with PR to cueing had room for improvement, thus avoiding a ceiling effect. Interestingly, patients with NPR, in spite of their less impaired performance without cues, did not maintain their gait speed with cues, but rather showed worsening of their performance (lower gait speed by −5%).

Similar effects were observed for stride length. At baseline, patients and controls with PR showed shorter strides than participants with NPR to cueing. Patients and controls with PR significantly increased their stride length with cueing (by 14 cm and 6 cm, respectively), while only patients with NPR exhibited a deleterious effect of cueing on stride length, significantly smaller when walking with cues (by 11 cm).

Finally, in both patients and controls with NPR, cueing had a deleterious effect on stride length variability, increased relatively to the baseline (F (1,74) = 8.10 p < 0.01).

### Group therapeutic singing improves clinical motor scores in persons with Parkinson's disease [^111P7W4N]. BMJ Neurology Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusion

The results of this study provide the preliminary behavioural evidence suggesting that GTS improves motor symptoms beyond the typical pharmacological effect for some persons with PD. Any improvement in symptoms is worthy of continued research to further the understanding and implementation of music and singing in the treatment of persons with PD.

### Effects of music-based movement therapy on motor function, balance, gait, mental health, and quality of life for patients with Parkinson's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115JoV7i]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To conduct a systematic review evaluating the effects of music-based movement therapy on motor function, balance, gait, mental health, and quality of life among individuals with Parkinson's disease.

Data Sources

A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Physiotherapy Evidence Database was carried out to identify eligible papers published up to December 10, 2020.

Review Methods

Literature selection, data extraction, and methodological quality assessment were independently performed by two investigators. Publication bias was determined by funnel plot and Egger's regression test. "Trim and fill" analysis was performed to adjust any potential publication bias.

Results

Seventeen studies involving 598 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Music-based movement therapy significantly improved motor function (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor subscale, MD = -5.44, P = 0.002; Timed Up and Go Test, MD = -1.02, P = 0.001), balance (Berg Balance Scale, MD = 2.02, P < 0.001; Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test, MD = 2.95, P = 0.001), freezing of gait (MD = -2.35, P = 0.039), walking velocity (MD = 0.18, P < 0.001), and mental health (SMD = -0.38, P = 0.003). However, no significant effects were observed on gait cadence, stride length, and quality of life.

Conclusion

The findings of this study show that music-based movement therapy is an effective treatment approach for improving motor function, balance, freezing of gait, walking velocity, and mental health for patients with Parkinson's disease.

### Tango for treatment of motor and non-motor manifestations in Parkinson's disease… [^112fSG1N]. ClinicalTrials (2012). Low credibility.

Tango for Treatment of Motor and Non-motor Manifestations in Parkinson's Disease. ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Traditional exercise programs can meet these needs but often they are not very appealing for older adults including patients with PD. Unfortunately more than half of individuals with PD does not meet the recommended daily level physical activity. There is a connection between music and level of Dopamine, which is pivotal for establishing and maintaining behavior. According to recent study music-induced emotional states can increase dopamine release, partially explaining how musical experiences are so valued and why music is an especially potent pleasurable stimulus for most people, and is frequently used to affect emotional states. The development of interventions which combine exercise, with accessibility, enjoyability, good motivation to practice regularly improving mood and stimulating cognition would be ideal for individuals with PD.

Dance may provide all of these characteristics, and so may be an affective useful and accessible intervention to improve motor impairments. Dance requires dynamic balance and permanent adjustment to the environment at the same time. It promotes enjoyment and encouragement interest in continuing participation. Habitual social dancers have superior balance, gait function, and reaction times compared with age-matched nondancers. Regular dancing improves balance and functional mobility, and increases motivation to continue healthful exercise-related behaviours in older adults. Why Argentinean tango. Better improvements of balance and complex gait were observed in elderly participants in tango lessons compared with a walking group. Beneficial effect of Argentine tango was also suggested, compared to traditional exercise for improving balance and functional mobility in patients with PD.

Furthermore, a positron emission tomography study has shown increased activity in the basal ganglia when tango movements were performed with a metered and predictable beat. Tango requires particular motor skills, including frequent initiation and cessation, a variety of movement speeds, rhythmic variation, and spontaneous multidirectional perturbations. These features target motor impairments with movement initiation, turning, and bradykinesia. Interesting, tango could also effectively address freezing of gait, because some step patterns mimic the rehabilitation exercises designed for those with FOG. Tango appeared to have a larger effect on freezing compared to other styles of dancing. Tango involves the practicing of control of movement speed and size, which may improve walking velocity and stride length. It also adds slow and quick steps of varying lengths and requires continual adjustment of these features.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Participants

For this study, 15 volunteers with PD (6 female) were recruited with the help of the National Parkinson's organization of Norway. Fifteen healthy controls (8 female) were recruited, group‐matched for age, education level, as well as for musical expertise. A minimum Mini Mental Status (MMS) (Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975) test score of 24 was set as a criterion in both groups to exclude patients with cognitive impairment indicative of dementia. All participants were right handed by self‐report. The Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale III (UPDRS‐III) (Fahn et al. 1987) was administered in the PD‐group. All PD‐participants — except one newly diagnosed de novo patient — were in medication regimens (LDOPA, D2‐agonists, inhibitors) at the time of the fMRI‐scan. (See Table 1 for an overview of the groups). All procedures were approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REK no 2014/1915) and carried out in accordance with the code of Ethics of the World Medical Association, Declaration of Helsinki. Before the tests, all participants gave written informed consent to participate in the study. Participants were compensated with 100NOK for participation in this study.

### The ronnie gardiner rhythm and music method-a feasibility study in Parkinson's disease [^115aGD71]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the feasibility of the novel intervention, Ronnie Gardiner Rhythm and Music (RGRM™) Method compared to a control group for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).

Method

Eighteen patients, mean age 68, participating in a disability study within a neurological rehabilitation centre, were randomly allocated to intervention group (n = 12) or control group (n = 6). Feasibility was assessed by comparing effects of the intervention on clinical outcome measures (primary outcome: mobility as assessed by two-dimensional motion analysis, secondary outcomes: mobility, cognition, quality of life, adherence, adverse events and eligibility).

Results

Univariable analyses showed no significant differences between groups following intervention. However, analyses suggested that patients in the intervention group improved more on mobility (p = 0.006), cognition and quality of life than patients in the control group. There were no adverse events and a high level of adherence to therapy was observed.

Conclusions

In this disability study, the use of the RGRM™ Method showed promising results in the intervention group and the adherence level was high. Our results suggest that most assessments chosen are eligible to use in a larger randomized controlled study for patients with PD.

Implications For Rehabilitation

The RGRM™ Method appeared to be a useful and safe method that showed promising results in both motor and cognitive functions as well as quality of life in patients with moderate PD. The RGRM™ Method can be used by physiotherapists, occupational, speech and music therapists in neurological rehabilitation. Most measurements were feasible except for Timed-Up-and-Go.

### Amplifying walking activity in Parkinson's disease through autonomous music-based rhythmic auditory stimulation: randomized controlled trial [^111eBds6]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

It is also important to acknowledge the worsening in variability that occurred with the Active-Control group. The results suggest that the technology-free walking program performed by the Active-Control group failed to promote task-specific training on walking rhythmicity, thereby carrying a cost on gait variability. This finding reinforces the need for walking interventions with multi-objective targets that include walking quality (gait variability) together with intensity and amount of walking.

Daily walking activity, a vital component of human behavior, is reduced in PD. Rehabilitation experts recognize the urgent need to design effective PD interventions to promote regular, habitual walking activity, Our study uniquely documented how habits pertaining to 'walking for exercise' form in people with PD. We quantified habit strength using the Self-Report Habit Index (SRHI), which is a standardized and reliable measure of habit strength for health behaviors, including physical activity. Habits are automatically recurring behaviors that arise from contextual cues associated with the behavior. In this study, we posited that the MR-005 system would deliver strong contextual (music-based) cues during walking that would promote stronger habits for walking in favor of the Amped-PD group over the Active-Control group. However, our findings revealed that habits were effectively increased by engaging in real-world walking interventions, whether participants used RAS or not. This outcome may be explained by two considerations. First, in addition to RAS, other elements of the intervention may have emerged as contextual cues for participants' habit formation. Particularly, both groups used a study diary (tracking log) and received weekly phone check-ins with the physical therapist. The collective effects of these procedures may have served as cue mechanisms that promoted regular engagement in the walking activity, high adherence, high repetition of the behavior, and ultimately a perceived improvement in habit strength in both groups. Second, the relatively brief intervention length may not have been sufficient to reveal between-group differences with habit formation. While the current study shows that walking with autonomous RAS is habit-forming, we expect that longer intervention periods will show divergence in group responses, where stronger associations of walking with autonomous RAS will outweigh effects of other contextual cues (e.g. diary). Nonetheless, our finding on strengthening of habits was very encouraging, given that habit control is principally governed by basal ganglia circuitry, which is compromised in PD. Our study sample included people with mild-to-moderate PD with low disease burden, which suggested that habit formation may be more amenable in earlier stages of PD than in later stages. This evidence extended support for initiating habit-forming gait interventions early in the course PD, to take advantage of the responsiveness to behavioral change approaches that may have a favorable impact on walking activity in subsequent stages of the disease.

### Amplifying walking activity in Parkinson's disease through autonomous music-based rhythmic auditory stimulation: randomized controlled trial [^116FV7xW]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

In regards to habit and walking outcomes, while the Amped-PD group had an improvement in habit strength at 8 weeks, we saw a drop in walking outcomes at study completion after 8 weeks when the device was withdrawn. This incongruity between walking activity and habit is largely due to withdrawal of RAS system itself which served as an important contextual cue for the walking behavior. Future studies are needed to examine habit and walking activity with long-term use and more continuous access to the RAS device to more robustly examine their association.

To our knowledge, our study was the first to use the SRHI in connection with PD walking interventions. We therefore explored its construct validity by examining the relationship between behavior repetition and habit strength. Our findings demonstrated that 16% of the variance in amount of walking intervention explained by habit formation, consistent with findings of a systematic review on the use of SRHI on health behaviors (i.e. R² ≈ 0.20). This finding suggested that regular engagement in a walking intervention is an important driver of habit formation. However, it is noteworthy that while strengthening habits were achieved through either intervention, only the Amped-PD intervention resulted in combined improvements in habit strength, amplified real-world walking activity, and improved gait variability. Thus, the critical ingredients of the walking intervention through MR-005 matters. Building walking habits is critical; however, simply engaging in walking (not enhanced by MR-005) is not sufficient to achieve robust changes in clinically-relevant walking activity outcomes.

### Quantitative measurements of alternating finger tapping in Parkinson's disease correlate with UPDRS motor disability and reveal the improvement in fine motor control from medication and deep brain stimulation [^111Losdr]. Movement Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is the primary outcome measure in most clinical trials of Parkinson's disease (PD) therapeutics. Each subscore of the motor section (UPDRS III) compresses a wide range of motor performance into a coarse-grained scale from 0 to 4; the assessment of performance can also be subjective. Quantitative digitography (QDG) is an objective, quantitative assessment of digital motor control using a computer-interfaced musical keyboard. In this study, we show that the kinematics of a repetitive alternating finger-tapping (RAFT) task using QDG correlate with the UPDRS motor score, particularly with the bradykinesia subscore, in 33 patients with PD. We show that dopaminergic medication and an average of 9.5 months of bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (B-STN DBS) significantly improve UPDRS and QDG scores but may have different effects on certain kinematic parameters. This study substantiates the use of QDG to measure motor outcome in trials of PD therapeutics and shows that medication and B-STN DBS both improve fine motor control.

Results

Clinical and neuropsychological evaluations

Clinical and neuropsychological evaluations of patients and controls are presented in Table 1. Patients were comparable to controls in terms of general cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment score). However, patients exhibited more depressive symptoms, and more apathy than controls. Moreover, they were more concerned than controls by the fact that they might fall.

### Group-based music intervention in Parkinson's disease-findings from a mixed-methods study [^116JC68h]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

With respect to clinical practice, this study does not support the efficacy of the Ronnie Gardiner Method in producing gains in dual-task ability, balance, cognition, or freezing of gait, in patients with Parkinson's disease. There are, however, indications that the therapy was socially and psychologically beneficial. The therapy was appreciated for its playfulness, the use of music, and the engaging therapists. In addition, the therapy was safe to use, and the attendance rate was high. The group-based music intervention may therefore be useful in cases when motivation for physical exercise is low.

Clinical messages

The group-based music intervention, the Ronnie Gardiner Method, did not improve dual-task ability, cognition, balance, or freezing of gait in patients with Parkinson's disease.
A short-term reduction for concerns about falling was found, but not for balance.
Patient-reported outcomes and interviews indicate that the group-based therapy adds value to mood, alertness, and quality of life.

### Music to move persons with Parkinson's disease: a personalized approach [^113A9W3H]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

The importance of the case report is twofold. First, listening to music can serve as a compensation strategy to optimize walking and reduce FOG. Importantly, the subjective effect was greatest when listening to his favorite music, suggesting that an emotional component (presumably by activation of the limbic system) was a contributing factor. Further working mechanisms may involve the music acting as an external rhythmic cue, enabling a shift from automatic to goal-directed gait control. This could also explain why many patients indicate that certain rhythms work better for them than others, because cueing frequencies must be tailored to the patient's individual needs and abilities. Moreover, compared to regular walking, dancing movements likely involve alternative motor programs that are less dependent on automatized movement generation by the basal ganglia. Second, although our patient experienced no subjective benefits from dopaminergic medication at home, we actually observed a substantial difference between the dopaminergic ON and OFF states during formal testing in the clinic. Recognizing ON and OFF states and appreciating the effect of dopaminergic medication can be difficult for patients, particularly after a long disease duration. Objective verification of the treatment response can then be helpful, if needed by maximizing the contrast testing patients in both a practically defined OFF state and a clear ON state, after intake of a supramaximal levodopa dose. Understanding the actual degree of dopaminergic responsiveness helps to optimize the pharmacotherapy regime, and this was also illustrated here: increasing the levodopa dose improved FOG in daily life. Our patient benefited most from the combined effect of both medication, favorite music and a walker. As basal ganglia circuitries are presumably still involved in the production of dancing movements, optimization of dopaminergic treatment probably has a complementary effect. This leads to our conclusion that optimal FOG management typically requires a multifaceted and personalized approach.

### Gait ecological assessment in persons with Parkinson's disease engaged in a synchronized musical rehabilitation program [^117DrxCz]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Healthy individuals' beat perception ability influences their footstep synchronization with music. The immediate effect on gait parameters observed during auditory cueing in PwPDs appears to be linked to their rhythmic abilities as measured with the Battery for the Assessment of Auditory Sensorimotor and Timing Abilities (BAASTA), and to musical training. Since the response to the cueing therapy can be predicted by the synchronization performance in hand tapping and gait tasks, the adaptability of the stimulation proposed by BeatMove is a way to address the variability of individual responsiveness.

As encouraging as these results are, a large-sample randomized study is required. It is currently in progress and compares walking in the absence of cueing (effect of physical activity), walking with music but no interactive cueing (assessing the motivating aspect of music), and walking with interactive music (examining the potential reduction in dual-tasking and activation of the reward prediction mechanism).

Phase synchronization of music with gait in PwPDs is a promising rehabilitation tool. BeatMove is a digital mobile device delivering in-phase synchronized music and measuring gait improvements in real-time. Its incorporation in a rehabilitation program such as the BeatPark program improved the walking performance and adherence of PwPDs, likely attributable to its motivational properties.

### Amplifying walking activity in Parkinson's disease through autonomous music-based rhythmic auditory stimulation: randomized controlled trial [^11713faM]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Intensity and amount of real-world walking

During both the walking intervention and follow-on periods, the groups differed significantly in terms of daily minutes of moderate intensity walking gained relative to baseline. During the 6-week walking intervention period (Fig. 3A), the Amped-PD group gained 23.38 ± 8.84 min compared to 6.91 ± 18 min gained by the Active-Control group (F (1,34) = 12.89, p = 0.001), which are considered large effects (Cohen's d effect size: 1.2). Similarly, during the 2-week follow-on period, (Fig. 3A), the Amped-PD group gained 20.85 ± 11.1 6 min compared to 8.0 ± 20.18 min gained by the Active Control group (F (1,34) = 5.91, p = 0.021; Cohen's d: 0.82). The between-group difference in daily moderate intensity minutes gained disappeared after eight weeks at post-program completion, when both groups returned to baseline levels (F (1,34) = 0.01, p = 0.932).

### Amplifying walking activity in Parkinson's disease through autonomous music-based rhythmic auditory stimulation: randomized controlled trial [^112mjjPn]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

The resultant improvements in STV during uncued walking at the completion of training provided encouraging and intriguing evidence of motor learning, even in the presence of PD, consistent with other studies that have explored this possibility –. Other studies have demonstrated immediate, short-term carryover effects of RAS leading to improvements in variability only when RAS tempos were faster than baseline walking speeds. Therefore, our intervention's delivery of progressively fast tempos in addition to the high volume of practice (i.e. 30 min, 5x/week x 6 weeks of walking intervention) were likely contributors to training-related effects on gait variability. Given that our assessments of variability were performed at the completion of the intervention, studies that examine longer retention and no-intervention periods are needed to examine durability of these effects.

The observed difference in intervention training effects on STV may have been influenced by group differences in baseline STV, which were higher (worse) in the Amped-PD group [4.2 ± 2.4%COV] than in the Active-Control Group [2.9 ± 0.80%COV] (p = 0.043). Indeed, a recent systematic review supported the idea that RAS effects on gait variability can be relatively pronounced in individuals with higher gait variability at baseline. Tosserams and colleaguesextended this idea to a variety of gait compensation strategies (including external cueing): individuals with higher baseline variability tend to show larger improvements. While a plausible interpretation of our results, we propose two additional points for consideration. First, the Active-Control group had baseline STV that approximated CoV in other studies involving people with PD (e.g. 2.6 ± 1.0% in the study by Hausdorff et al; 2.4 ± 0.6% in the study by Lo et al.). Notably, the study by Hausdorff et al. showed significant RAS-related reductions in CoV from 2.6% to 2.2%, demonstrating a propensity for improvement. Thus, baseline STV in the Active-Control group, although lower than in the Amped-PD group, was still abnormally high, did not suffer from ceiling effects, and could have been improved if the intervention had involved RAS. Second, although the Amped-PD group demonstrated a significant inverse relationship between baseline STV and training-related effects on STV at 6-weeks (rₛ(19) = −0.80, p < 0.001) and 8 weeks (rₛ(19) = −0.56, p = 0.01), no such relationships were found in the Active Control group. Thus, baseline STV may have mattered only for the Amped-PD group. Traditional methods for examining confounding baseline effects (e.g. ANCOVA, linear mixed model) were not appropriate for this dataset due to violations of model assumptions. Future studies with larger samples with more balanced gait variability at baseline between groups are needed to more directly examine training-related responses on gait variability adjusted to baseline gait variability.

### Rhythmic abilities and musical training in Parkinson's disease: do they help? [^111BHwp6]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Music is a universal trait of humankind. The majority can move to the beat, react emotionally to music, recognize well-known tunes, and sing proficiently. These skills, which can be improved via dedicated training, are generally referred to as "musicality", and vary considerably among individuals. Remarkably, individual differences in musicality may play a critical role in understanding the variability of the response to music-based interventions in neurological rehabilitation. In particular, rhythmic skills and the ability to move to the beat of music may predict the well-known response to rhythmic auditory cueing (RAC) on gait of patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD). – In PD, the dysfunctional basal-ganglia-cortical circuitry is associated with timing distortions in the perception and production of rhythmic events. – Providing an external rhythmic cue is likely to compensate for the impaired internal generation of rhythm, as suggested recently. The magnitude of this effect and whether RAC improves or deteriorates motor performance may depend on individual differences in rhythmic skills.

In patients with PD, the immediate beneficial effect of RAC on gait (increased speed, stride length and reduction of freezing episodes) has largely been demonstrated. – However, these effects have only been described at the group level. Even though the effect of stimulation can vary significantly form one study to the other (e.g. with average effect sizes for stride length between 0 and 0.5), individual variability of this response and its determinants have not been examined so far, nor the possibility of deleterious effects of cueing in some patients. Finally, oftentimes music is used by the general population to improve motivation and performance in motor activities, such as in sport. For example, most people run and walk while using music-based applications implemented in mobile devices. Similar music-based applications are already proposed to patientsbut the risks associated with the potential deleterious effects of music delivered by these technologies in patients with PD have never been addressed.

Discussion

Patients with PD responded very differently to RAC. Some of them significantly increased their speed and did longer steps, while others in spite of relatively unimpaired gait without the stimulation, worsened dramatically their performance. In some cases RAC can thus hamper gait kinematics, a result which is at odds with the generally observed beneficial effects of the stimulation. –, We uncovered factors linked to PR or NPR pertaining to rhythmic abilities and other aspects of musicality (i.e. perception and musical training), baseline gait performance, and cognitive functioning.

Patients who positively responded to cueing could track the beat of an auditory stimulus, while patients with NPR struggled with beat perception. This ability was linked to patients' ability to synchronize their steps to the beat of music while walking with cues. Notably, this finding is not merely the result of instructions, as participants were not explicitly told to synchronize their steps to the beat. Rather, it is likely that patients can positively respond to cueing because they can still capitalize on spared beat perception and synchronization mechanisms. PR to cueing was also associated with some aspects of patients' musicality. Fine grained perceptual skills and musical training positively affected the response to cueing. Surprisingly, the patients who benefited most from the cues were also those with poorer cognitive flexibility.

In spite of the oft-reported timing and rhythmic deficits in PD, – many patients could still synchronize to the beat, a fact which was associated to a PR to the cues. In contrast, patients who were unable to align their steps to the beat may have found themselves in a dual-task situation whereby rhythmic cues rather disturbed gait. The deleterious effect of dual tasks on gait is well known in PD.

Significantly, controls and almost one third of the patients benefited from cueing even if they did not align their steps to the beat. Other factors such as emotional and motivational aspects may also contribute to improve gait. Music is typically a motivating stimulus, known for its ability to engage emotions and stimulate the reward system, while acting on the dopaminergic system. Walking with music may be a rewarding activity in itself. However, our results show no influence of the type of stimulus. Walking with music was expected to be more rewarding than with a metronome. Moreover, patients with PR to cueing did not report being in general more engaged in musical tasks or emotionally driven than the others. An alternative explanation, which deserves further inquiry, is that auditory stimuli altogether are more arousing while walking as compared with no stimulation.

Statistical analyses

To ensure adequate power, the chosen sample size of patients was comparable or larger than in previous studies showing an effect of cueing on gait (e.g. 11). Patients with PD were compared to controls for demographic and neurological variables using t -tests. As no effect of the type of rhythmic stimulus was observed on gait, data were pooled before running subsequent analyses.

Spatio-temporal gait parameters were entered in 2 × 2 mixed-design ANOVAs with Group (patients vs. controls) as between-subject factor and Condition (baseline vs. cueing) as within-subject factor. As no significant interactions were found in the ANOVAs only main effects of Group (patients vs. controls) and Condition (cueing vs. baseline) are reported. Normality of distributions was assessed with Shapiro-Wilk tests, and heteroscedasticity with Bartlett tests of homogeneity of variances. Tests revealed that in most of the cases the two assumptions were met. Participants with PR and NPR to cueing were compared via 2 × 2 × 2 ANOVAs using Group (patients vs. controls) and Response (PR vs. NPR) as between-subject factors, and Condition (baseline vs. cueing) as the within-subject factor. Whenever the triple interaction was significant (p < 0.05), the interaction was decomposed by running separate 2 × 2 ANOVAs for patients and controls. For the assessment of rhythm perception and production, synchronization, and musicality, patients' individual performances were transformed into z -scores based on the mean and standard deviation of controls. Transformation into z -scores was performed separately for individuals with PR and NPR to cueing. Finally, in order to compare patients with NR to cueing (n = 6) to all other patients, given the small sample size, non-parametric tests were used (Wilcoxon rank sum tests).

### Feasibility of external rhythmic cueing with the google glass for improving gait in people with Parkinson's disease [^11746m7u]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

New mobile technologies like smartglasses can deliver external cues that may improve gait in people with Parkinson's disease in their natural environment. However, the potential of these devices must first be assessed in controlled experiments. Therefore, we evaluated rhythmic visual and auditory cueing in a laboratory setting with a custom-made application for the Google Glass. Twelve participants (mean age = 66.8; mean disease duration = 13.6 years) were tested at end of dose. We compared several key gait parameters (walking speed, cadence, stride length, and stride length variability) and freezing of gait for three types of external cues (metronome, flashing light, and optic flow) and a control condition (no-cue). For all cueing conditions, the subjects completed several walking tasks of varying complexity. Seven inertial sensors attached to the feet, legs and pelvis captured motion data for gait analysis. Two experienced raters scored the presence and severity of freezing of gait using video recordings. User experience was evaluated through a semi-open interview. During cueing, a more stable gait pattern emerged, particularly on complicated walking courses; however, freezing of gait did not significantly decrease. The metronome was more effective than rhythmic visual cues and most preferred by the participants. Participants were overall positive about the usability of the Google Glass and willing to use it at home. Thus, smartglasses like the Google Glass could be used to provide personalized mobile cueing to support gait; however, in its current form, auditory cues seemed more effective than rhythmic visual cues.

### Amplifying walking activity in Parkinson's disease through autonomous music-based rhythmic auditory stimulation: randomized controlled trial [^116vDr4Q]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Stride-to-stride variations in stepping are linked with basal ganglia function, and heightened (worse) stride time variability is believed to be due to loss of walking automaticity. Thus, gait variability serves as an important marker of stability of walking performanceand a measure of the neurodynamics of walking. Importantly, STV is associated with disease severity and disability in PD. Following the 6-week walking intervention period, the Amped-PD group demonstrated significant improvement (reduction) in STV during uncued walking, whereas the Active-Control group demonstrated worsened (increased) STV. Similar patterns and trends were observed at the 8-week assessment. The absence of between-group differences in other gait-related secondary outcomes suggested that benefits on gait variability were independent and likely a product of task-specific training with the autonomous closed-loop RAS system. The modest within-group improvements in fast gait speed and stride length following each intervention were likely attenuated by minimal deficits on walking speeds at baseline. Nonetheless, these changes in walking demonstrated a response in the desired direction. Longer interventions are needed to examine each intervention's comprehensive effects on gait variability and other walking quality metrics.

Limitations

While this was a preliminary study, there are limitations to consider. The criteria for diagnosis of PD is unknown due to the nature of the study site. There is the possibility that other neurodegenerative diseases may have been present in the participant sample. In addition, we did not control specifically for the timing or dose of medication, but rather maintained the same day and time for the GTS intervention. For both of these limitations, the study design reflects the typical delivery of the intervention in which GTS is offered at a particular time regardless of each individual's medication and the participants may have other diagnoses other than PD that are unknown at the time of the intervention. Finally, given the nature of the intervention and study design, there is the potential of a placebo effect and study bias. Further long-term research including an appropriate control is needed.

The immediate response to cueing was linked to some aspects of patients' musicality, such as self-assessed perception and musical training. The activities engaging the neural circuitries for beat perception such as learning to play an instrument or singing might thus be put to use in rehabilitation. Whether previous musical training influences the specific neuronal pathways underpinning the beneficial effects of cueing is an open question. Rhythmic cues provide a regular temporal scaffolding supporting motor coordination (e.g. by directing patients' attention towards the onsets of individual steps), thus probably compensating for patients' impaired internal timing. The underlying mechanism would be underpinned by compensatory cortico-subcortical networks such as cerebello–thalamo–cortical circuitries, typically affected only later in the disease, or by the residual activity of cortico-striatal networks. Patients having received some form of musical training may be better equipped to benefit from RAC than non-musicians. In sum, musical experience, as observed in other neurodegenerative disorders or in stroke, may play a neuroprotective role in PD.

### Amplifying walking activity in Parkinson's disease through autonomous music-based rhythmic auditory stimulation: randomized controlled trial [^117F6fbv]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to daily minutes of moderate intensity walking, we also examined between-group differences in the percentage of time spent walking at moderate intensity within individual intervention sessions. During the walking intervention period, the Amped-PD group spent 83.11 ± 16.40% of sessions walking at moderate intensity. In contrast, the Active-Control group spent 46.07 ± 35.49% of the time at that level (F (1,30) = 14.96, p < 0.001). Similarly, during the follow-on period, the Amped-PD group spent a greater percentage of sessions walking at moderate intensity (76.63 ± 27.77%) compared to the Active-Control group (37.91 ± 59.69%, F (1,29) = 11.86, p = 0.002)

A similar pattern of between-group and within-group results was observed for daily step counts. During the walking intervention period (Fig. 4A), the Amped-PD group gained significantly more daily steps relative to baseline (3343 ± 1642) compared to an almost negligible 172 ± 4009 steps gained by the Active Control group (F (1,34) = 10.39, p = 0.003), revealing large effect size following the Amped-PD intervention (d: 1.08). During the follow-on period, the between-group difference in daily steps gained approached significance ((F (1,34) = 3.57, p = 0.067, d = 0.63), with the Amped-PD group gaining 2543 ± 2555 steps relative to baseline compared to the Active-Control group gaining 614 ± 2759 steps. The magnitudes of daily step count gains in the Amped-PD group during the intervention and follow-on periods were 1.86–2.44 times a published minimum detectable change (MDC) value of 1366 steps, signifying that the changes were clinically meaningful. In contrast, the Active-Control group had gains below the MDC threshold during both periods. The between-group differences in daily step count gains during training dissipated at post-program completion (F (1,34) = 1.65, p = 0.207, d = 0.43). Moreover, the Active-Control group had a notable reduction in daily steps at study completion, which exceeded the MDC value.

### Structural and functional neuroplasticity in music and dance-based rehabilitation: a systematic review [^1119H3UP]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

In this section, we aim to highlight some limitations of the present review. First, it is important to emphasize that the primary outcomes considered — namely, neuroimaging-derived structural and functional changes — represent highly restrictive selection criteria. These criteria were chosen to address a gap in the literature by focusing on the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these interventions, with the specific goal of elucidating neuroplasticity mechanisms, including structural and functional brain changes. As a result, numerous studies examining variables such as gait, balance, movement, voice, and quality of life — factors that are crucial for understanding the broader clinical impact of music- and dance-based interventions — were not included in this review. For this reason, studies on conditions such as Parkinson's disease, in which music- and dance-based treatments have been extensively investigated and have demonstrated significant clinical effects on motor symptoms, balance, functional mobility, and cognitive function, were not discussed. Despite these limitations, our study remains relevant as it aims to complement existing literature by providing novel insights into the underlying brain mechanisms, which are often underexplored.

Below, a structured overview of the limitations of the studies included in this review is provided.

Sample

Despite the wide variability in the neurological disorders of the studies included in this systematic review, some trials have enrolled a relatively small number of participants. This limitation is due to the fact that some studies focus on rare pathologies or conditions, such as HD and MCS, which limits the possibility of recruiting large samples.

Replicability

The studies in this systematic review covered various neurological pathologies and provided interventions targeting different circuits and functions. A common limitation was that imaging analyses were conducted on sub-samples from the original behavioral RCT, often lacking comprehensive clinical data and data analyses reports. This discrepancy can hinder the replicability and robustness of the findings.

Follow-up

Only one study included in this systematic review reported data on follow-up; limiting the ability to draw robust conclusions about the efficacy of the treatment over time.

Variability of biomarkers

Virtually each included study investigated a different neuroimaging marker, including GMV, WM integrity, anisotropy, FC, and brain activation, complicating the synthesis of findings about the overall effectiveness of music- and dance-based interventions on neuroplasticity. Compounding this issue is the absence of standardized assessment scales for evaluating the quality of neuroimaging measurements. Without such objective criteria, it becomes difficult to systematically assess and compare the reliability of the neuroimaging findings across studies.

### Good vibrations: tactile cueing for freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease [^116jxr1N]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating symptom of Parkinson disease (PD), described as having a feeling of the feet being 'glued to the floor'. FOG occurs in 20–60% of persons in later stages of PD. It highly impairs mobility, causes falls and reduces the quality of life. FOG improves only partially in response to pharmacological treatment; therefore, non-pharmacological treatments, such as external cueing, are a key complementary treatment modality. External cues include rhythmic temporal or spatial stimuli that can help to initiate or to continue movements, such as gait. Visual and auditory cueing effectively reduce FOG. The response to cueing, however, varies greatly between people with PD; indeed, not all persons with PD respond to cueing, and for some, gait may even worsen. Although the exact working mechanism of various types of cueing remains unknown, this specific compensation strategy aims to shift the habitual (internally driven) motor control of a person with PD to a more goal-directed (externally driven) control. In very practical terms, this means that people with FOG can overcome their FOG episodes by focusing their attention on gait via the external cues. Just like the more widely studied auditory and visual cues, tactile cues act in the same way to draw a person's attention to the act of walking.

### Group-based music intervention in Parkinson's disease-findings from a mixed-methods study [^115WA55R]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Music-based interventions have been suggested as adjunct management options for patients with Parkinson's disease. Dancing, for example, has been shown to improve cognitive dual-tasking, gait-related outcomes, and global cognition. Impaired motor-cognitive dual-tasking is a common deficit in patients with Parkinson's disease, which may be improved with targeted interventions. To increase the attractiveness, musical elements may be incorporated within such interventions, and the social benefits may be further enhanced if the intervention is group-based.

The music-based intervention Ronnie Gardiner Method involves multitasking activities that require the participants to quickly shift attention between motor and cognitive tasks by interpreting visual symbols, synchronizing arms and legs in complex coordinated movements, while simultaneously pronouncing a certain word to the beat of music. Apart from multitasking, the training has the potential to improve bradykinesia, balance, freezing of gait, and cognitive function in patients with Parkinson's disease. The therapy is practitioner-led and usually group-based for the benefits of social experiences and emotional well-being.

Few studies have evaluated the music-based group therapy to date. A randomized controlled trial on stroke survivors found long-term effects on the perception of recovery, balance, grip strength, and working memory compared to controls. With respect to Parkinson's disease, a small feasibility study revealed no between-group differences, but some tendencies towards improved mobility, cognition, and quality of life within the intervention group. A larger study is therefore needed to further investigate possible effects for patients with Parkinson's disease.

When evaluating novel complex interventions, both objective and subjective evaluations should be considered. Including qualitative approaches provides a more in-depth understanding about the intervention. To further broaden the perspectives, the delivering professionals should be included in the evaluation. The aim of this randomized trial was to evaluate the Ronnie Gardiner Method in Parkinson's disease and to gain insights into participants' and therapists' experiences of the group-based music intervention to optimize the contents, delivery, and acceptability and to facilitate further development.

### Group-based music intervention in Parkinson's disease-findings from a mixed-methods study [^111AhLbW]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

It should also be noted that 50% of the patients scored less than the normal cut-off (26/30)on the MoCA, and this is likely to have affected the ability to learn the complex dual-task movements for many participants, as well as to have contributed to the non-significant results. Research shows that patients with Parkinson's disease may experience difficulties in learning new complex motor skills and therefore require longer time than healthy adults, and this was confirmed by the therapists in this study. Future studies should examine the results obtained for different sub-groups, although this will require a larger sample.

The reduction regarding concerns about falling is in line with other exercise intervention studies. There is, however, a risk that the reduction may in fact increase the risk of falls in the absence of improved mobility and balance. Whether the results are clinically meaningful in terms of fewer falls remains therefore to be investigated, but since 80% of the patients experienced poor balance at baseline these findings may be of relevance.

There has been a call for the development of activities that encourage social interaction to improve well-being in patients with Parkinson's disease. The music-based group therapy under study includes sensory stimulation and music in pleasant social contexts, and thus has the potential to increase task enjoyment and improve the effectiveness of motor rehabilitation interventions. Patients from the intervention group were united in the perception that the activities were enjoyable ('a winning concept'), which may be a contributing factor to becoming more cheerful and alert. This is in agreement with qualitative studies on stroke survivors. Having fun together as a group in a stimulating activity may indeed add value in terms of peer support, motivation through group accountability, and social interactions that may have effects above and beyond the intervention itself.

The short-term improvements in self-perceived quality of life in the intervention group confirmed the positive trend of our previous feasibility study. Our findings are contrasting to a recently published systematic review and meta-analysis that found no evidence that music-based movement therapies (including dancing) led to quality of life improvements in patients with Parkinson's disease. The intervention group did not reach the minimal clinically important difference for Parkinson Disease Questionnaire-39. Although mean changes in our study were minor, they may have important clinical implications for patients with Parkinson's disease. In contrast, the worsening of the control group did exceed the minimal clinically important difference.

### Group therapeutic singing improves clinical motor scores in persons with Parkinson's disease [^117WRwFE]. BMJ Neurology Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Incorporating music into current treatment strategies for Parkinson's disease (PD) is beneficial, yet the underlying mechanism remains a challenge to understand. Various forms of dance and drumming improve functional mobility, postural instability and walking rate, while singing improves voice, respiratory control and swallow. These results are domain specific demonstrating improvements in outcome measures that are associated with the exercise/therapy or target area. Given that increased physical activity has many positive benefits in persons with PD, detangling the effects of music from the effects of increased physical activity/exercise is difficult. Examining the effects of music on non-domain specific outcome measures may provide further direction in understanding underlying mechanisms.

Group therapeutic singing (GTS) involves sitting and singing within a group for an hour, with no overt physical activity. In previous studies, Stegemöller et al found improvements in voice, respiratory control, swallow, quality of life after 8 weeks of GTS. Participants in these studies also reported that the groups were fun and relieved stress, they felt better and were able to move better after GTS. These results would suggest that GTS may have an effect on multiple symptoms, including motor symptoms of PD. Examining the effects of GTS on clinical motor symptoms may differentiate the effects of singing from physical activity, providing further insight into how music alone benefits person with PD. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine the effect of aa single session of GTS on the clinical evaluation of speech and facial expression, bradykinesia, gait and posture, and tremor using the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). Given the previous results of GTS, we hypothesised that only speech and facial expression will improve after 1 hour of GTS.

### Heightened orofacial, manual, and gait variability in Parkinson's disease results from a general rhythmic impairment [^113F2Qe3]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Among the symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), patients often experience a poor appraisal of rhythmic events. When patients are asked to move spontaneously or to the beat of an auditory stimulus (e.g. a metronome or music), timing deficits are found consistently in tasks such as manual tapping. These rhythmic abilities are known to engage subcortico-cortical networks involving the basal ganglia and the cerebellum, – some of which are affected in the progression of the disease. Rhythmic disorders in PD are found in other motor abilities, such as orofacial rhythmic coordination (e.g. oral diadochokinesis tasks), where patients have difficulties in keeping a steady — isochronous — oral rhythm, or gait, typically showing altered stride timing. Rhythm disorders in PD manifest also in perceptual tasks, in the absence of motor output, such as extracting the beat from a musical sequence. Altogether, these findings point towards a general rhythm disorder, so-called "general dysrhythmia", putatively linked to the malfunctioning of a neural circuitry devoted to rhythm processing, which might characterize PD and manifest across different effectors.

This hypothesis entails that rhythmic impairments across these domains should be correlated. Moreover, poor performance across rhythmic motor tasks should be accounted for by rhythmic non-motor tasks. Indeed performing a beat perception task recruits similar subcortico-cortical rhythm structuresas motor tasks. Evidence is scant on the relations between the three aforementioned motor domains and to date, studies have investigated only one or two effectorsat the same time in the same patients. Moreover, in none of these studies was rhythm assessed in a non-motor task. The above-mentioned hypothesis of general dysrhythmia is appealing as it would provide a parsimonious account of a number of rhythm disorders in PD. In fact, regarding rhythm-based management interventions, beneficial effects of training rhythmic skills in a given motor domain (e.g. gait) may theoretically and ideally transfer to other domains (e.g. oral articulation). Thus, the goal of this study is to fill this gap, to test the possibility that rhythm disorders in various motor domains in PD may derive from a common impaired central mechanism for rhythm processing. To this aim: (1) we examined relations between rhythm skills in oral diadochokinesia, finger tapping, and gait tasks and (2) we tested whether rhythm perception could predict rhythmic performance across these three motor domains.

### Effects of external rhythmical cueing on gait in patients with Parkinson's disease: a systematic review [^114NHQDb]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To critically review studies evaluating the effects of external rhythmical cueing on gait in patients with Parkinson's disease.

Methods

Articles published from 1966 to January 2005 were searched by two physiotherapists in MEDLINE, PiCarta, PEDRo, Cochrane, DocOnline, CINAHL and SUMSEARCH. To be included, articles had to investigate the effects of external rhythmical cueing (i.e., auditory, visual or tactile cueing) on gait parameters in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Both controlled and noncontrolled studies were included. Based on the type of design and methodological quality a meta-analysis or best-evidence synthesis was applied.

Results

Twenty-four studies (total number of patients = 626) out of the 159 screened studies were evaluated in this systematic review. Two out of 24 were randomized controlled trails (RCT), both of high methodological quality. One RCT did not focus specifically on external rhythmical cueing of individual patients with Parkinson's disease, but on group exercises in general, including walking with cues. All other studies were pre-experimental studies. Best-evidence synthesis showed strong evidence for improving walking speed with the help of auditory cues. Insufficient evidence was found for the effectiveness of visual and somatosensory cueing.

Conclusion

Only one high-quality study, specifically focused on the effects of auditory rhythmical cueing, suggesting that the walking speed of patients with Parkinson's disease can be positively influenced. However, it is unclear whether positive effects identified in the laboratory can be generalized to improved activities of daily living (ADLs) and reduced frequency of falls in the community. In addition, the sustainability of a cueing training programme remains uncertain.

### A comparison of Irish set dancing and exercises for people with Parkinson's disease: a phase II feasibility study [^116PNy5C]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

We have shown the feasibility of a RCT of Irish set dancing compared to standard physiotherapy for people with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Both of the programs were delivered successfully over a 6 month time period with very good attendance and good adherence. People with Parkinson's disease appeared to have the potential to benefit from dancing classes that incorporate elements such as rhythmical music, large amplitude fast movements, dancing with partners and step routines. What is not known is whether other dance genres, such as ballroom dancing, Tango, modern dance, square dancing, jazz ballet or classical ballet are more effective at improving movement, balance and quality of life in people with PD. Moreover the therapeutic effects of the different elements of Irish dancing, such as reel, polka and jig steps have not been quantified. The study did not compare dancing genres or the content and duration of dancing. The extent to which different types of music contribute to outcomes also remains open to question.

In terms of outcome measures, we were able to quantify motor disability using the motor component of the UPDRS, the Timed Up and Go, the Berg Balance Scale and the modified Freezing of Gait Questionnaire. Of these the UPDRS was best able to discriminate change and was quick and easy to administer. We also found it feasible to measure life quality using the PDQ-39.

There were a small number of limitations of this pilot study. Firstly, PD medications were not controlled, simply documented and testing did not always occur at peak dose in the medication cycle despite being always in the same hour. In addition the content of the standard physiotherapy treatment program reflected clinical practice in Italy and may not necessarily reflect contemporary clinical practice in other parts of the world even if the physiotherapy program was in according to the KNGF Guidelines for physical therapy in Parkinson's disease. The clinical relevance also needs to be considered given the modest effect sizes reported in this trial. Although modest changes were seen, this is argued to be clinically significant given that Parkinson's disease is a progressive and debilitating disease for which any benefits to mobility and quality of life can be considered to be helpful.

### Heightened orofacial, manual, and gait variability in Parkinson's disease results from a general rhythmic impairment [^113TdVu2]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience rhythm disorders in a number of motor tasks, such as (i) oral diadochokinesis, (ii) finger tapping, and (iii) gait. These common motor deficits may be signs of "general dysrhythmia", a central disorder spanning across effectors and tasks, and potentially sharing the same neural substrate. However, to date, little is known about the relationship between rhythm impairments across domains and effectors. To test this hypothesis, we assessed whether rhythmic disturbances in three different domains (i.e., orofacial, manual, and gait) can be related in PD. Moreover, we investigated whether rhythmic motor performance across these domains can be predicted by rhythm perception, a measure of central rhythmic processing not confounded with motor output. Twenty-two PD patients (mean age: 69.5 ± 5.44) participated in the study. They underwent neurological and neuropsychological assessments, and they performed three rhythmic motor tasks. For oral diadochokinesia, participants had to repeatedly produce a trisyllable pseudoword. For gait, they walked along a computerized walkway. For the manual task, patients had to repeatedly produce finger taps. The first two rhythmic motor tasks were unpaced, and the manual tapping task was performed both without a pacing stimulus and musically paced. Rhythm perception was also tested. We observed that rhythmic variability of motor performances (inter-syllable, inter-tap, and inter-stride time error) was related between the three functions. Moreover, rhythmic performance was predicted by rhythm perception abilities, as demonstrated with a logistic regression model. Hence, rhythm impairments in different motor domains are found to be related in PD and may be underpinned by a common impaired central rhythm mechanism, revealed by a deficit in rhythm perception. These results may provide a novel perspective on how interpret the effects of rhythm-based interventions in PD, within and across motor domains.

### Rhythmic abilities and musical training in Parkinson's disease: do they help? [^111KzhXS]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Musicality

Patients did not differ from controls overall in terms of musicality (Gold-MSI global index: 58.26 ± 15.60 vs. 55.24 ± 17.8, respectively, p = 0.4). Control participants with PR and NPR to cueing did not differ in any of the measures of the Gold-MSI (mean performance: 55.40 ± 17.6, p = 0.20).

Patients with PR to cueing (Fig. 3d) showed higher scores for perceptual abilities (t (36) = 2.28, p < 0.05), and musical training (t (34.1) = 1.80, p < 0.05) than patients with NPR; a trend towards significance was found for the Gold-MSI global index (t (32.5) = 1.61, p = 0.06). In contrast, no differences between the two sub-groups were found for the other measures (active engagement with music, singing abilities, and emotion). Thus, highly musical patients, namely in terms of self-assessed perceptual skills and musical training, were the ones who mostly benefited from cueing.

### Amplifying walking activity in Parkinson's disease through autonomous music-based rhythmic auditory stimulation: randomized controlled trial [^111aJMRZ]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

Data analyses was performed using SPSS Statistics (IBM, version 29). Study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at Boston University Medical Center. All measurements were taken from distinct participant samples. Normality of distribution was examined based on skewness and kurtosis, and the Shapiro-Wilk test. We used parametric and non-parametric statistics depending on normality of data distribution and other related test assumptions. To examine between-group differences for all primary outcomes, we ran a one-way ANOVA or Kruskall-Wallis test to compare change scores at the 6-Week and 8-Week clinical assessments relative to baseline. To examine within-group differences, we ran a Friedman's ANOVA on absolute values of all primary outcomes across their respective timepoints, with multiple post-hoc comparisons corrected using Bonferroni adjustments. As exploratory analyses on the relationship between habit strength and adherence, we ran a linear regression between SRHI at the 8-Week clinical assessment and total walking sessions completed for the study. For all secondary outcomes, we ran between-group analyses using non-parametric statistics to compare change scores at the 6-Week and 8-Week clinical assessments relative to baseline, using two-tailed tests with alpha set at 0.05. To fully convey the effect the intervention as intended, the study results reported above were based on a completer analysis. The reported results were consistent with an intention-to-treat analysis using "last-observation-carried-forward" data imputation (see Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). All statistical tests were two-sided, with central tendencies reported as mean and standard deviation.

The study's sample size was based on a priori power analysis using G*Power. With ANOVA set as statistical test, a total sample size of 36 across 2 groups was adequately powered (power = 0.80) with alpha of 0.05 to detect an effect size (f = 0.49) for the effects of intervention on the primary outcome of change in moderate intensity minutes. For the purpose of the power analyses, we focused on moderate intensity minutes as this directly hinges on the fundamental premise of the intervention. Thus, conceptually, the effects of other outcomes rely on successful engagement in moderate intensity walking enabled by the RAS intervention. To account for at least 20% attrition across groups, a total sample of 44 was set as the target sample size (22 per group).

### Amplifying walking activity in Parkinson's disease through autonomous music-based rhythmic auditory stimulation: randomized controlled trial [^112c2TWM]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

The Amped-PD group clearly engaged in intervention sessions that were substantially more vigorous than in the Active-Control group, where close to 80% of the entire session's duration was performed at moderate-to-vigorous intensities. In contrast, the Active-Control group walked at moderate intensities less than half the session's duration. We have shown previously that the MR-005 system was capable of eliciting immediate gait-enhancing benefits during use, improving walking speed, stride length, cadence and variability. Lab-based studies have shown energy cost savings during faster walking, and penalties for walking slower in people with PD. Taken together, the gait-improving benefits of MR-005, along with presumed improvements on gait efficiencies associated with faster walking may enabled access to latent capacities to engage in more vigorous walking. At study completion, the intensity of walking for both groups returned to baseline. In support of our hypothesis, the withdrawal of the autonomous RAS system from the Amped-PD group at study completion resulted in walking intensities returning to baseline levels due to removal of the technology that enabled access to latent capacities for more vigorous walking. This suggests the need for continuous access to the autonomous RAS system for daily use. Further, the ongoing improvements on walking activity while using the autonomous RAS system offer potential application for use as assistive aid especially for users with more gait impairments. It will be important for future studies to examine prolonged (e.g. 6-month) impact of MR-005 use on natural walking activity and how it might compare with standard-of-care walking interventions. The extent to which it might result in a more long-lasting change in walking activity following use has not yet been determined. This issue is especially important, given the degenerative nature of PD, expected natural declines in walking activity without intervention, and the known health benefits of regular moderate intensity walking.

### Music to move persons with Parkinson's disease: a personalized approach [^114d2VV2]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gait impairments, and freezing of gait (FOG) in particular, are common and disabling for many people with Parkinson's disease (PD). During FOG episodes, patients feel as if their feet are suddenly being 'glued to the floor'. Treatment can be challenging but remains critically important as a good mobility is vital for independence and quality of life. Optimal management involves both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Non-pharmacological interventions include the use of compensation strategies, which should be tailored to each individual's preferences and abilities. Clinical experience suggests that what works for one patient may not work for the next, but there is still relatively little documentation of this individualized response to non-pharmacological interventions. Here, we illustrate the importance of personalizing non-pharmacological interventions, and also demonstrate the value of objectively evaluating the effects of dopaminergic medication.

### The use of rhythmic auditory cues to influence gait in patients with Parkinson's disease, the differential effect for freezers and non-freezers, an explorative study [^1124hNxa]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

To study the effect of rhythmic auditory cues on gait in Parkinson's disease subjects with and without freezing and in controls.

Method

A volunteer sample of 20 patients (10 freezers, 10 non-freezers) and 10 age-matched controls performed five randomized cued walking conditions in a gait-laboratory. Auditory cues were administered at baseline frequency, at an increased step frequency of 10 and 20% above baseline and at a decreased step frequency of 10 and 20% below baseline. Mean step frequency, walking speed, stride length and double support duration were collected.

Results

Rhythmical auditory cueing induced speed changes in all subjects. Stride length was not influenced by rhythmical auditory cues in controls, whereas patients showed a larger stride length in the -10% condition (p < 0.01). Freezers and non-freezers showed the same response to rhythmical auditory cues. Within group analysis for stride length showed different cueing effects. Stride length decreased at the +10% condition for freezers (p < 0.05), whereas it increased for non-freezers.

Conclusions

This study points to fact that physiotherapists might need to carefully adjust the cueing frequency to the needs of patients with and without freezing. On the basis of the present results we recommend to lower the frequency setting for freezers, whereas for non-freezers an increase of up to +10% may have potential therapeutic use.

### Abnormal phasic activity in saliency network, motor areas, and basal ganglia in Parkinson's disease during rhythm perception [^115aB9VT]. Human Brain Mapping (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Behavioral studies indicate that persons with Parkinson's disease have complexity dependent problems with the discrimination of auditory rhythms. Furthermore, neuroimaging studies show that rhythm processing activates many brain areas that overlap with areas affected by Parkinson's disease (PD). This study sought to investigate the neural correlates of rhythm processing in PD and healthy controls, with a particular focus on rhythmic complexity. We further aimed to investigate differences in brain activation during initial phases of rhythm processing. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to scan 15 persons with Parkinson's disease and 15 healthy controls while they listened to musical rhythms with two different levels of complexity. Rhythmic complexity had no significant effect on brain activations, but patients and controls showed differences in areas related to temporal auditory processing, notably bilateral planum temporale and inferior parietal lobule. We found indications of a particular sequential or phasic activation pattern of brain activity, where activity in caudate nucleus in the basal ganglia was time‐displaced by activation in the saliency network — comprised of anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral anterior insula — and cortical and subcortical motor areas, during the initial phases of listening to rhythms. We relate our findings to core PD pathology, and discuss the overall, rhythm processing related hyperactivity in PD as a possible dysfunction in specific basal ganglia mechanisms, and the phasic activation pattern in PD as a reflection of a lack of preparatory activation of task‐relevant brain networks for rhythm processing in PD.

### Novel challenges to gait in Parkinson's disease: the effect of concurrent music in single-and dual-task contexts [^115BuTu5]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effect of concurrent music on parkinsonian gait in single- and dual-task contexts.

Design

A counterbalanced repeated-measure design.

Setting

A university balance research laboratory.

Participants

People with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) (n = 10) (67 ± 7 y) and healthy age-matched (65 ± 6 y) control subjects (n = 10).

Intervention

Subjects walked at a self-selected pace along an unobstructed walkway in 4 differing test conditions. Test conditions were differentiated by the presence of music accompaniment (no music/music) and the presence of a secondary cognitive task (single/dual). Single- and dual-task conditions were randomized; trials were blocked by the presence of music and counterbalanced between subjects. Music was self-selected by subjects. The cognitive task consisted of serial subtractions (3's). Subjects were not instructed to attend to the music nor were they provided with instructions regarding task prioritization.

Main Outcome Measures

Mean gait velocity, stride length, and the percentage of the gait cycle spent in double-limb support.

Results

Gait among the PD patients was adversely affected by concurrent music. In contrast, gait performance in the control subjects showed no significant difference between no music and music conditions. The added requirement of a cognitive task differentially influenced gait performance in PD patients and control subjects, with PD patients displaying a further decrease in spatiotemporal parameters of gait and control subjects displaying a marginal improvement.

Conclusions

Gait impairments associated with PD are exacerbated in the presence of concurrent music, an effect that is further exaggerated by the addition of a cognitive task. These results have implications for patient safety in multitasking situations.

### Amplifying walking activity in Parkinson's disease through autonomous music-based rhythmic auditory stimulation: randomized controlled trial [^111aoST1]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

The study was a prospective, single-blinded (assessor), 2-arm randomized controlled trial examining the effects of using MR-005, an investigational, autonomous, closed-loop digital RAS system that uses music as an auditory modality (MedRhythms, Inc, USA) to improve walking in persons with mild-to-moderate PD. We conducted the trial (clinicaltrials.gov registration #: NCT05421624, registered on June 6, 2022) at Boston University from August 2022 to November 2023. All aspects of the study protocol were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and under approval of the Boston University – Charles River Campus Institutional Review Board (#6518). Signed informed consents were obtained prior to study enrollment. The trial (Fig. 1 and 2) was initiated with a phone screen, followed by an in-person clinical screening assessment to determine full eligibility to participate in the study. Enrolled participants first underwent a baseline assessment that included PD-specific assessments, instrumented walking tests, and real-world (naturalistic) monitoring of customary daily walking activity. Participants subsequently engaged in a 6-week walking intervention period (i.e. defined schedule and remotely monitored), either delivered with the MR-005 system (experimental Amped-PD group) or without any specific delivery modality or RAS (Active-Control group). See Intervention section for details on MR-005. Regardless of group, participants wore an activity monitor on select days during this phase of the trial. Following a clinical reassessment, all participants were instructed to engage in a follow-on period (i.e. ad lib) for two additional weeks. The Amped PD group retained possession of MR-005 for use as desired during this period, and real-world walking activity was monitored in all participants on select days. Participants returned for a final post-intervention clinical reassessment, 8 weeks after the baseline assessment. Amped PD participants returned MR-005 to the research team at that time. Following the final clinical assessment, all participants underwent an additional period of real-world activity monitoring. No important changes to study design were implemented after trial commencement.

### Choral singing therapy following stroke or Parkinson's disease: an exploration of participants' experiences [^1178D8BQ]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

People with stroke or Parkinson's disease (PD) live with reduced mood, social participation and quality of life (QOL). Communication difficulties affect 90% of people with PD (dysarthria) and over 33% of people with stroke (aphasia). These consequences are disabling in many ways. However, as singing is typically still possible, its therapeutic use is of increasing interest. This article explores the experiences of and factors influencing participation in choral singing therapy (CST) by people with stroke or PD and their significant others.

Method

Participants (eight people with stroke, six with PD) were recruited from a community music therapy choir running CST. Significant others (seven for stroke, two for PD) were also recruited. Supported communication methods were used as needed to undertake semi-structured interviews (total N = 23).

Results

Thematic analysis indicated participants had many unmet needs associated with their condition, which motivated them to explore self-management options. CST participation was described as an enjoyable social activity, and participation was perceived as improving mood, language, breathing and voice.

Conclusions

Choral singing was perceived by people with stroke and PD to help them self-manage some of the consequences of their condition, including social isolation, low mood and communication difficulties.

Implications For Rehabilitation

Choral singing therapy (CST) is sought out by people with stroke and PD to help self-manage symptoms of their condition. Participation is perceived as an enjoyable activity which improves mood, voice and language symptoms. CST may enable access to specialist music therapy and speech language therapy protocols within community frameworks.

### The possible price of auditory cueing: influence on obstacle avoidance in Parkinson's disease [^115zFtQs]. Movement Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Under carefully controlled conditions, rhythmic auditory cueing can improve gait in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). In complex environments, attention paid to cueing might adversely affect gait, for example when a simultaneous task-such as avoiding obstacles-has to be executed. We primarily examined whether concurrent auditory cueing interferes with an obstacle avoidance task in patients with PD. The secondary aim was to study differences between patients with and without freezing of gait.

Methods

Nineteen patients with PD (8 with freezing) were examined on a treadmill in 4 conditions: normal walking; walking with auditory cueing; walking with an obstacle avoidance task; and walking with auditory cueing and obstacle avoidance. Outcome measures included kinematic gait parameters and obstacle crossing parameters.

Results

Auditory cueing improved gait in PD, without negative effects on concurrent obstacle avoidance. Additionally, freezers avoided obstacles less efficiently than non-freezers.

Conclusions

PD patients are able to successfully execute an obstacle avoidance task, when auditory cueing is administered simultaneously. The different obstacle avoidance behavior in freezers may contribute to their higher fall risk.

### Encoding of sequence boundaries in the subthalamic nucleus of patients with Parkinson's disease [^112Zs26R]. Brain (2014). Low credibility.

Sequential behaviour is widespread not only in humans but also in animals, ranging in different degrees of complexity from locomotion to birdsong or music performance. The capacity to learn new motor sequences relies on the integrity of basal ganglia-cortical loops. In Parkinson's disease the execution of habitual action sequences as well as the acquisition of novel sequences is impaired partly due to a deficiency in being able to generate internal cues to trigger movement sequences. In addition, patients suffering from Parkinson's disease have difficulty initiating or terminating a self-paced sequence of actions. Direct recordings from the basal ganglia in these patients show an increased level of beta (14–30 Hz) band oscillatory activity associated with impairment in movement initiation. In this framework, the current study aims to evaluate in patients with Parkinson's disease the neuronal activity in the subthalamic nucleus related to the encoding of sequence boundaries during the explicit learning of sensorimotor sequences. We recorded local field potential activity from the subthalamic nucleus of 12 patients who underwent deep brain stimulation for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease, while the patients in their usual medicated state practiced sequences of finger movements on a digital piano with corresponding auditory feedback. Our results demonstrate that variability in performance during an early phase of sequence acquisition correlates across patients with changes in the pattern of subthalamic beta-band oscillations; specifically, an anticipatory suppression of beta-band activity at sequence boundaries is linked to better performance. By contrast, a more compromised performance is related to attenuation of beta-band activity before within-sequence elements. Moreover, multivariate pattern classification analysis reveals that differential information about boundaries and within-sequence elements can be decoded at least 100 ms before the keystroke from the amplitude of oscillations of subthalamic nucleus activity across different frequency bands, not just from the beta-band. Additional analysis was performed to assess the strength of how much the putative signal encoding class of ordinal position (boundaries, within-sequence elements) is reflected in each frequency band. This analysis demonstrates that suppression of power in the beta-band contains the most class-related information, whereas enhancement of gamma band (31–100 Hz) activity is the second main contributor to the encoding. Our findings support the hypothesis that subthalamic nucleus-mediated gating of salient boundary elements during sequence encoding may be a prerequisite for the adequate acquisition of action sequences and the transition to habitual behaviour.

### Effects of multimodal balance training supported by rhythmical auditory stimuli in people with advanced stages of Parkinson's disease: a pilot randomized clinical trial [^113HxzTa]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

Non-pharmacological interventions such as physiotherapy are recognized as important elements in the overall clinical management of motor impairments in PD, but evidence of physiotherapy in advanced disease stages is sparse. A recent trial found positive effects of multimodal balance training in people with mild to moderate PD, with greater and more sustained effects when rhythmical auditory stimuli were added. It is unclear whether such multimodal balance training is also effective in people with advanced PD (Hoehn & Yahr stage 4).

Methods

We performed a pilot prospective single-blind, randomized clinical trial to study the effectiveness of multimodal training with and without rhythmical auditory stimuli. We screened 76 people with Parkinson's disease and Hoehn & Yahr stage 4 by telephone; 35 patients were assigned randomly into two groups: (1) multimodal balance training with rhythmical auditory stimuli (RAS-supported intervention, n = 17) and (2) multimodal balance training without rhythmical auditory cues (n = 18). Training was performed for 5 weeks, two times/week. Primary outcome was the Mini-BESTest (MBEST) score immediately after the training period. Assessments were performed by the same two blinded assessors at baseline, immediately post intervention, and after one and 6-months follow-up.

Results

Immediately post-intervention, both intervention groups improved significantly on Mini-Best scores, without differences between both intervention modalities. In both groups, results were retained at one-month follow-up. At 6-months follow-up, the effects were retained only in the RAS-supported intervention group. For both intervention groups, no improvements were found on secondary outcome measures for gait.

Conclusion

Both RAS-supported multimodal balance training and regular multimodal balance training improve balance in PD patients in advanced disease stages. Effects appear to sustain longer in the RAS-supported training group.

### Amplifying walking activity in Parkinson's disease through autonomous music-based rhythmic auditory stimulation: randomized controlled trial [^112M9FaR]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The lack of accessible and sustainable gait interventions that collectively target intensity, amount, and quality of walking in PD marks a critical gap in the rehabilitation of individuals of PD. The current clinical trial presents evidence of the effectiveness of a walking intervention delivered by an autonomous, closed-loop music-based RAS system. In comparison to the Active-Control intervention, the Amped-PD intervention using the MR-005 system amplified moderate-to-vigorous walking intensities, increased daily steps, and improved (reduced) gait variability. While both interventions cultivated "walking for exercise" habits, only the intervention with the MR-005 system yielded a combination of strengthened habits, amplified walking activity, and improved gait quality. Findings from this study advance our understanding on the potential of technology-driven gait rehabilitation that is safe, personalized, habit-forming, and translatable for community use by people with PD.

Left alone, people with PD experience natural declines in daily walking intensity and amount of walking year after yearat rates that outpace the decline of other walking-related impairments and participation restrictions. Conversely, people with PD who purposefully engage in regular moderate intensity exercise have a better clinical course of PD, including slower declines in postural control and gait functions. In the current study, we capitalized on the benefits of auditory-motor entrainment delivered via a closed-loop music-based RAS intervention to promote increased walking activity in the community. Our findings demonstrated that MR-005 effectively led to significant and substantial improvements in both daily walking intensity and amount during use, indicative of additive benefits on top of customary walking activity. Notably, the Amped-PD group achieved improvements in daily moderate intensity walking that approximated or exceeded 30 min during both the 6-week walking intervention period and the 2-week follow-on period. By extension, this number of daily moderate intensity minutes of walking equated to ≥ 150 min per week, thus harmonizing with public health guidelines for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. These increases in real-world walking activity with the autonomous RAS intervention significantly surpassed the effects induced by a closely matched control intervention of brisk walking without RAS. Furthermore, there were no significant changes in daily walking intensity and volume with brisk walking without RAS.

### Gait ecological assessment in persons with Parkinson's disease engaged in a synchronized musical rehabilitation program [^117DyMZ2]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The main motor impairments allowing the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD), rigidity, akinesia, tremor, and postural instability, have an impact on gait. Gait impairments are reflected by a reduction in step length, an increase in cadence, higher variability in postural control, freezing of gait, etc. These walking impairments are among the most disabling symptoms of PD. A large number of studies have demonstrated the positive effects of physical activity on health parameters and physical capacities of persons with PD (PwPDs), especially gait. Chronic aerobic exercises (dance, Nordic walking, cycling on stationary home trainer, etc.) have also shown positive effects on the progression of motor symptoms –.

Despite the benefits of chronic aerobic exercises, adherence to the recommended program remains a challenge necessitating the development of highly motivational tools. Music and dance activities are well-suited in this context as they enhance movement and have a high intrinsic motivation impact. The rhythm conveyed by music (e.g. its underlying beat of pulse) has a cueing effect facilitating gait initiation and regularity of step alternation in PD –. The strong motivating effect of musical rhythmic cueing involves a positive emotional reaction sustained by the activation of reward dopaminergic system activation –. Overall, music could serve as a powerful tool to enhance movement and promote exercise.

### Tremor [^114aYVCh]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Tremor, defined as a rhythmic and involuntary movement of any body part, is the most prevalent movement disorder, affecting millions of people in the United States. All adults have varying degrees of physiological tremor so it is imperative to distinguish physiological tremor from pathological tremor types. Tremor is not inherently dangerous, but it can cause significant disability at home and in the workplace. Common tremors like essential tremor and Parkinson disease tremor can be recognized by most clinicians at the early stages for the initiation of disease-specific medical therapies. Less common tremors, such as those induced by drugs or brain lesions, are also important to recognize because they may be more refractory to medical therapies and may require earlier referral to a neurological specialist. In patients with the most progressive and severe tremors that are resistant to medical therapies, surgical interventions are available and typically target deep brain regions with stimulation or lesioning. This Grand Rounds review describes the evaluation and evidence-based management of the most common tremors, essential tremor and Parkinson disease tremor.

### The effect of rhythmic somatosensory cueing on gait in patients with Parkinson's disease [^111vwa48]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Gait and gait related activities in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) can be improved with rhythmic auditory cueing (e.g. a metronome). In the context of a large European study, a portable prototype cueing device was developed to provide an alternative for rhythmic auditory cueing: rhythmic somatosensory cueing (RSC, a miniature vibrating cylinder attached to the wrist). We investigated whether PD patients could adapt their walking pattern using RSC under conditions of changing walking speed and the presence of potentially distracting visual flow while walking on a treadmill.

Methods

A total of 17 patients with PD participated (mean age 63.4 ± 10.3 years; Hoehn-Yahr score 2.5 ± 0.9, mean Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score 49.8 ± 13.7, mean disease duration 7.7 ± 5.1 years). They performed systematic walking speed manipulations under 4 conditions in a random order: (1) no cue, no visual flow, (2) no cue, visual flow, (3) cue, no visual flow and (4) cue, visual flow. Visual flow in the form of a virtual corridor that moved at the current walking speed was projected on a 2 x 2 m rear-projection screen. The cueing rhythm was set at -10% of preferred stride frequency at each speed. Stride frequency was assessed using peaks in the trajectories of thigh sagittal plane segmental angles.

Results

Walking with RSC resulted in lower stride frequencies, and thus larger step lengths (p-values < 0.05), regardless of walking speed. The presence of visual flow did not impair the use of RSC, as evidenced by the lack of differences between conditions 3 and 4 (p > 0.05).

Conclusion

Rhythmic somatosensory cueing may be a viable alternative for auditory cueing and is robust to changes in walking speed and visual distractors.

### Restoring walking ability in older adults with arm-in-arm gait training: study protocol for the AAGaTT randomized controlled trial [^112X6VX8]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

In the context of an aging population, the high incidence of falls among older people is a cause for concern. Approximately one in three older people falls each year. In addition to high direct costs, the consequences of falls include functional deficits, loss of mobility, and impaired quality of life. Strategies can be implemented to reduce the incidence of falls and their negative consequences if those at risk are identified early. A recent systematic review concluded that exercise programs reduce the rate of falls and the number of older people who fall (high certainty evidence). Effective interventions usually consist of balance and functional exercises. It is still unclear whether regular walking has specific effects on reducing the risk of falling. It is not excluded that incorporating more walking into the daily lives of older people may expose them to more opportunities to fall. Making walking safer could be one solution.

Walking while synchronizing gait to rhythmic auditory cues, such as walking to the beat of upbeat music, has substantial benefits for improving walking capacity in older adults. Initially proposed to treat specific pathologies such as Parkinson's disease, rhythmic gait training also benefits the general older population in terms of gait performance (faster speed and longer strides). Similarly, a meta-analysis showed that rhythmic gait training may increase walking speed. In patients with Parkinson's disease, recent evidence from a randomized controlled trial suggests that rhythmic gait training may reduce the number of falls. However, it remains uncertain whether this beneficial effect on fall risk generalizes to all older people. It has also been proposed to improve locomotor function by synchronizing gait with other types of sensory cues. For example, aligning steps to visual cues displayed on the walking surface is an effective means of improving gait in Parkinson's disease. Training with visual feedbacks is also used to improve static and dynamic balance, with likely benefits in the older population. Overall, there is strong evidence to support the use of external cues, either auditory or visual, to improve the efficacy of gait training in older people. However, further studies are needed to better define the most efficient way to deliver such gait training and to confirm its true effectiveness in reducing falls.

### Amplifying walking activity in Parkinson's disease through autonomous music-based rhythmic auditory stimulation: randomized controlled trial [^117RCQSr]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Habitual moderate intensity walking has disease-modifying benefits in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the lack of sustainable gait interventions that collectively promote sufficient intensity, daily amount, and quality of walking marks a critical gap in PD rehabilitation. In this randomized controlled trial (clinicaltrials.gov#: NCT05421624, registered on June 6, 2022), we demonstrate the effectiveness of a real-world walking intervention delivered using an autonomous music-based digital rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) system. In comparison to an active-control arm (N = 20) of moderately intense brisk walking, the autonomous RAS system used in the experimental arm (N = 21) amplified moderate-to-vigorous walking intensities, increased daily steps, and improved (reduced) gait variability. While regular engagement in real-world walking with or without RAS each cultivated habits for walking, only the RAS intervention yielded a combination of strengthened habits and improved gait outcomes. Findings from this study supported the use of a personalized, autonomous RAS gait intervention that is effective, habit-forming and translatable to real-world walking in individuals with PD.

Results

Participants

Fifty-six people with PD were screened for eligibility. Please see CONSORT Diagram (Fig. 1) and CONSORT Checklist (Supplementary Table 1) for details. Forty-four participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to one of the two intervention arms, with equal sample sizes in each. In the Amped-PD group, 21 out of 22 participants completed the full 8-week study (Fig. 2), while one participant dropped out early. In the Active-Control group, 20 out of 22 participants completed the 6-week walking intervention period, while two participants dropped out. Additionally, one participant in the Active-Control group did not complete the final 2-week follow-on period. In summary, the number of participants eligible for analyses was 21 for Amped-PD group and 20 for Active-Control group, with some exclusions per analysis.

Real-world step assessment (moderate intensity minutes, daily steps) was performed at Baseline, during the intervention, during the follow-on period and at post-program completion. In-lab clinical assessments of gait stride time variability (STV) were performed at Baseline, Post 6-Week Assessment, and Post-8-Week Assessment. Self-reports of habit for "walking for exercise" were obtained at baseline and Post-8-week Assessment.

Both groups were comprised of older adults with idiopathic PD (Hoehn & Yahr Stage 2.2.5 (range 1–3), mild disease severity and relatively low disease burdenbased on the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scoreand the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39. Demographic characteristics were similar across groups (Table 1). Both groups were physically and cognitively high functioning, displaying only mild impairments of balance, walking capacity, and walking endurance. Participants in both groups reported moderate confidence in their physical capability to walk at a moderately fast pace on the Self-Efficacy for Walking Duration Scale. No changes in medications were noted during the trial.

### Group-based music intervention in Parkinson's disease-findings from a mixed-methods study [^112hXe62]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

This was a single-blinded, parallel group randomized controlled trial, integrating data from qualitative methods. The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board of Linköping (Dnr 2016/179–31), and all participants signed an informed consent form after receiving oral and written information. The trial was registered at(NCT02999997). The study was conducted following the recommendations of Consolidating Standards for Reporting Clinical Trials (CONSORT) with the extension to the reporting guidelines for music-based interventions and the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative data (COREQ).

The following inclusion criteria were used for this study: community-dwelling individuals from 18 years of age with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and Hoehn and Yahrup to stage 3, stable medication ⩾four months, and capacity to walk 10 m without gait assistance. To enhance the generalizability of the findings, any medical treatment, even surgical, was accepted. Neurologists screened medical records from the Departments of Neurology and Geriatrics to identify potential study participants of both genders, who were then contacted by telephone by the first author (P.P.) between December 2016 and August 2017.

Recruited patients underwent a full clinical assessment by specialists in movement disorders at the University hospital and were excluded if they had other neurological deficits or serious health conditions that would compromise participation; significant visual or hearing impairments that would make participation impossible; or severe motor fluctuations. Demographic data included age, gender, disease duration, education level, and fall history the last 12 months. In relation to fall history, patients were asked: 'Are you experiencing poor balance?' with a 'Yes' or 'No' response option. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scalewas also included.

After the initial examination, included patients were referred to an occupational therapist for cognitive tests, followed by physical tests by the first author. The same assessors performed cognitive and physical re-evaluations within two weeks post-intervention and three months post-intervention. Both assessors remained blind to group allocation at all evaluations.

### Abnormal phasic activity in saliency network, motor areas, and basal ganglia in Parkinson's disease during rhythm perception [^1134Kubq]. Human Brain Mapping (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

In Parkinson's disease (PD), the progressive death of dopaminergic neurons in the Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNpc) in the basal ganglia disrupts several subcortico‐cortical loops in motor, associative, and limbic circuitry (Alexander, DeLong, & Strick, 1986; Lanciego, Luquin, & Obeso, 2012; Middleton & Strick, 2000), causing increasing motor and nonmotor symptoms with disease progression (Aarsland et al. 2004; Xia & Mao, 2012). Some motor symptoms in PD are responsive to dopaminergic pharmacological treatment (Mazzoni, Shabbott, & Cortes, 2012; Xia & Mao, 2012), but some gait‐specific symptoms (Knutsson, 1972) are relatively unresponsive (Blin, Ferrandez, & Serratrice, 1990; Smulders, Dale, Carlson‐Kuhta, Nutt, & Horak, 2016). However, while people with advanced stages of Parkinson's disease have problems with volitional movement, external rhythms facilitate movement (McIntosh, Brown, Rice, & Thaut, 1997), and in therapy, simple isochronous pulsed rhythms seem to be particularly effective in improving gait‐related symptoms (Thaut, McIntosh, McIntosh, & Hoemberg, 2001). Studies on rhythm perception in PD have found discrimination deficits, that is, difficulties in judging, when subsequent rhythms are identical or different. Some studies find this deficit to be more pronounced for simpler rhythms (Biswas, Hegde, Jhunjhunwala, & Pal, 2016; Grahn & Brett, 2009), while one study shows a more generalized deficit (Cameron, Pickett, Earhart, & Grahn, 2016). The effect of dopamine replacement therapies on rhythm perception indicates that medication improves beat detection in simple rhythms (Cameron et al. 2016; Geiser & Kaelin‐Lang, 2011), but has adverse effects on more complex rhythms (Cameron et al. 2016). Rhythm and rhythmic complexity modulate neural activity in areas and widespread networks across the brain and imaging studies in PD show abnormal activity in many of these areas, some of which are directly related to the pathology of PD. A better understanding of the modulatory effects of rhythmic complexity on behavior and the neural correlates, thereof could provide more specific knowledge about the neural basis for the temporal (Parker, Lamichhane, Caetano, & Narayanan, 2013; Schwartze & Kotz, 2015) and rhythm specific (Biswas et al. 2016; Cameron et al. 2016; Grahn & Brett, 2009) deficits in the disease.

### Study details | NCT07068217 | Effect of metronome-based structured rhythmic exercise program on freezing and gait parameters in parkinson disease… [^111CHYqE]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Effect of Metronome-Based Structured Rhythmic Exercise Program on Freezing and Gait Parameters in Parkinson DiseaseClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Background: Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, leading to motor symptoms such as resting tremor, freezing episodes, gait disturbances, rigidity, and bradykinesia. It is estimated that approximately 6. 1 million people worldwide live with PD. With disease progression, freezing episodes and gait impairments intensify, significantly limiting independence and increasing both fall risk and mortality. Although a definitive cure is lacking, symptom management relies on pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. In PD patients, adaptability to environmental changes and the ability to process sensory inputs and generate motor responses become impaired.

Therefore, sensory re-education using auditory, somatosensory, or visual cues is employed. External cues support motor learning by facilitating initiation and maintenance of movement. By promoting cortical reorganization, these cues can improve gait quality, reduce freezing severity, and enhance participation in daily life. A commonly used method in this context is Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation. Administered with metronome beats or music, RAS provides external cues via the auditory system to reorganize gait patterns. In patients experiencing freezing, motor blocks during gait can be overcome through rhythmic stimulation. Numerous studies have reported that RAS improves gait speed, step length, and cadence. Despite its benefits, there is a paucity of methodologically robust, standardized trials evaluating the effects of RAS on real-world symptoms such as gait disturbances and freezing.

Therefore, there is a clear need for structured interventions based on metronome-driven rhythmic cues and clinical trials assessing their impact. Furthermore, investigating feasibility in home settings via telerehabilitation is valuable for enhancing accessibility of such interventions. Purpose: To assess the effects of a structured rhythmic exercise program using metronome cues on freezing episodes, gait parameters, balance, fall risk, and quality of life in PD patients. REG: The structured exercise program will be conducted with metronome cues tailored to each participant's cadence using the "Google Metronome" app. EG: Participants will perform the same exercises at their own pace, without rhythmic cues. At the first visit, the demographic information form containing the demographic information and clinical features of all volunteers will be recorded with the necessary information.

### Group-based music intervention in Parkinson's disease-findings from a mixed-methods study [^111haZSn]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

The category 'Design of treatment sessions' shows that the patients agreed that twice weekly one-hour sessions were just right, and this opinion was shared by the therapists. Many of the exercises were performed sitting down by choice, even when the therapists gave the option to stand up. One man from the face-to-face interviews said: 'I preferred to stand up while doing the exercises, it's a bit like dancing, at least sway a little (laughing). If you get it to work, it's more fun than to just sit down and "boom", "chic", and so on. Music affects you very much physically!' The therapists prioritized movement quality: 'If they are unstable, it's better if they sit down and do the movements properly; otherwise they will fail to perform them correctly'.

The difficulty of the exercises was also reflected upon. Many patients had great difficulties in learning the complex skills, and the therapists found it difficult to negotiate the right level to fit everyone, because the group was heterogeneous. Instead they tried to compromise, but this had consequences for the patients who were quick learners: 'I had expected the training to be much harder and more challenging, I wanted to challenge my abilities more than it did. Only at the end they increased the speed and it became more challenging to me' (man, individual interviews). For this patient, the exercises soon became repetitive.

There were conflicting ideas about how to improve the sessions. Patients suggested adding more homework, but the therapists disagreed; in their experience, homework was rarely carried out. Patients also suggested to combine the therapy with other therapy-specific activities, because 'this is not enough as physical exercise', and 'to make the long journey worth the while'. This was, however, not supported by the therapists, as they believed that the patients would then suffer from lack of energy that would compromise the outcome of one or the other activity. Both patients and the therapists reported that the patients were exhausted after each session, and this slowed down all movements notably.

### Unleashing creativity in people with Parkinson's disease: a pilot study of a co-designed creative arts therapy [^11115BuJ]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the worlds' fastest growing neurodegenerative condition, affecting millions worldwide. PD is characterized by motor dysfunctions such as tremor, bradykinesia, and stiffness. Beyond these motor symptoms, PD also involves a wide range of non-motor features that profoundly affect the health-related quality of life and well-being of individuals. Anxiety and depression are particularly prevalent non-motor symptoms. These motor and non-motor symptoms have debilitating consequences, including diminished social engagement, autonomy, and self-efficacy — i.e. the belief in one's ability to succeed in one's own actions.

Conventional medical management, while essential, cannot address all multifaceted consequences of PD, especially non-motor symptoms that require a person-centered and lifestyle-oriented approach. A multidisciplinary and holistic approach is likely needed, fueling interest to generate evidence for non-pharmacological interventions. Among these, interventions within creative arts therapy represent a promising approach. For example, creative arts therapy in the visual art domain has been suggested to increase visual-cognitive skills and emotional well-being in people with PD, with improvements in emotional expression, social interaction, and overall life satisfaction. Music intervention have shown to have beneficial effects on motor function, speech, and mood, but also stigma and anxiety reduction. Dance for people with PD increased executive functioning, spatial awareness, cognitive flexibility as well as reduced anxiety, depression, and apathy. Positive effects of engaging in creative activities (including, e.g. dance, music, theater, visual arts) have also been described outside the PD field. Studies in older adults have reported, for example, increased well-being and personal growth, while community programs noted greater social engagement, less isolation, decreased experience of stigma, and better community ties. These findings raise the intriguing question whether it is possible to investigate art just as if it were a drug, including a focus on efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and adverse effects.

### NCT01573260 | Tango for treatment of motor and non… [^11625cuH]. ClinicalTrials (2012). Low credibility.

Tango for Treatment of Motor and Non-motor Manifestations in Parkinson's Disease. ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Traditional exercise programs can meet these needs but often they are not very appealing for older adults including patients with PD. Unfortunately more than half of individuals with PD does not meet the recommended daily level physical activity. There is a connection between music and level of Dopamine, which is pivotal for establishing and maintaining behavior. According to recent study music-induced emotional states can increase dopamine release, partially explaining how musical experiences are so valued and why music is an especially potent pleasurable stimulus for most people, and is frequently used to affect emotional states. The development of interventions which combine exercise, with accessibility, enjoyability, good motivation to practice regularly improving mood and stimulating cognition would be ideal for individuals with PD.

Dance may provide all of these characteristics, and so may be an affective useful and accessible intervention to improve motor impairments. Dance requires dynamic balance and permanent adjustment to the environment at the same time. It promotes enjoyment and encouragement interest in continuing participation. Habitual social dancers have superior balance, gait function, and reaction times compared with age-matched nondancers. Regular dancing improves balance and functional mobility, and increases motivation to continue healthful exercise-related behaviours in older adults. There is also evidence that exercise has a positive impact on cognitive function in vulnerable populations. Musical exercise improved cognitive function in residents of long- term care facilitations without diagnosis of dementia and in patients with established Alzheimer's disease.

Particularly dance produces clinically important changes in measures of mental status and behaviour in patients with moderate to severe dementia. Why Argentinean tango. Better improvements of balance and complex gait were observed in elderly participants in tango lessons compared with a walking group. Beneficial effect of Argentine tango was also suggested, compared to traditional exercise for improving balance and functional mobility in patients with PD. Furthermore, a positron emission tomography study has shown increased activity in the basal ganglia when tango movements were performed with a metered and predictable beat. Tango requires particular motor skills, including frequent initiation and cessation, a variety of movement speeds, rhythmic variation, and spontaneous multidirectional perturbations. These features target motor impairments with movement initiation, turning, and bradykinesia.

Interesting, tango could also effectively address freezing of gait, because some step patterns mimic the rehabilitation exercises designed for those with FOG.

### How often does music and rhythm improve patients' perception of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease? [^111hLt9t]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Dear Sirs,

There is a strong interest in combining pharmacological treatments with non-drug therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD). One such non-pharmacological therapy is music and rhythm stimulation, with anecdotal benefits and favorable preliminary clinical studies. It is suggested that the rhythmic properties of music reduce certain motor features of PD, perhaps by entraining the brain mechanisms that control timing, sequencing and coordination of movements. Early investigations into the effect of auditory rhythms on movement and PD were promising, and their benefits and possible modes of action confirmed by recent neuroimaging studies. However, we noticed an apparent discrepancy between the evolving literature on music, rhythm and PD, and the frequency of spontaneously reported benefits of music from patients in the clinic. We therefore asked: how commonly do patients themselves perceive an improvement in their motor symptoms with music and rhythm?

We designed and administered a written structured music questionnaire (Supplementary Material) to 50 patients with idiopathic PD (age 65.47 ± 7.8, stage I–III H&Y) during their routine visit to the Cambridge University PD Research Clinic. In addition, eight members of a PD choir (age 68.84 ± 6.9, II–III H&Y) completed the questionnaire, providing a highly motivated and musically experienced patient group. Participants completed the questionnaire (with multiple choice and open-ended questions) sitting in a quiet room. They were asked about (1) handedness, (2) symptomatic hearing problems (Y/N/details), (3) enjoyment of music (Y/N), (4) hours spent weekly listening to music, (5) styles of music listened to (free text), (6) formal musical training (instrument, type and years of training) and dance training (style, type and years of training), (7) current weekly time playing/performing music (Y/N/hours), and (8) whether they had ever noticed a beneficial effect of music on their PD symptoms (Y/N/free text details). Statistical analysis used IBM SPSS Statistics Version 19.

### Group-based music intervention in Parkinson's disease-findings from a mixed-methods study [^115XRBj6]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate a group-based music intervention in patients with Parkinson's disease.

Design

Parallel group randomized controlled trial with qualitative triangulation.

Setting

Neurorehabilitation in primary care.

Subjects

Forty-six patients with Parkinson's disease were randomized into intervention group (n = 26), which received training with the music-based intervention, and control group (n = 20) without training.

Interventions

The intervention was delivered twice weekly for 12weeks.

Main Measures

Primary outcome was Timed-Up-and-Go subtracting serial 7's (dual-task ability). Secondary outcomes were cognition, balance, concerns about falling, freezing of gait, and quality of life. All outcomes were evaluated at baseline, post-intervention, and three months post-intervention. Focus groups and individual interviews were conducted with the intervention group and with the delivering physiotherapists.

Results

No between-group differences were observed for dual-task ability. Between-group differences were observed for Falls Efficacy Scale (mean difference (MD) = 6.5 points; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.0 to 10.0, P = 0.001) and for Parkinson Disease Questionnaire-39 items (MD = 8.3; 95% CI = 2.7 to 13.8, P = 0.005) when compared to the control group post-intervention, but these were not maintained at three months post-intervention. Three themes were derived from the interviews: Expectations versus Results, Perspectives on Treatment Contents, and Key Factors for Success.

Conclusion

Patient-reported outcomes and interviews suggest that the group-based music intervention adds value to mood, alertness, and quality of life in patients with Parkinson's disease. The study does not support the efficacy in producing immediate or lasting gains in dual-tasking, cognition, balance, or freezing of gait.

### Gait ecological assessment in persons with Parkinson's disease engaged in a synchronized musical rehabilitation program [^1126tjkk]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

After 4 weeks of training, 5 sessions/week, with synchronized music, we obtained an increase in speed of 0.40 m/s (+41%) measured at a comfortable rate. In comparison, one 5 week, 3 sessions/week in silence, rehabilitation program of gait, walking over ground has shown an increase in speed of 0.06 m/s (+5%), and a 3-week home music (with predefined tempo) gait training has shown an increase in speed of 0.15 m/s (+25%). A controlled study on gait with cueing (metronome and preferred pace), at home and supervised by physiotherapists, has shown an increase in speed of 0.05 m/s. Another study similar to ours in terms of ecological setting, duration, and training conditions, has reported an increase in distance at the 6MWT of 12 m (2.5%) compared to 24 m (5.6%) in ours.

The larger increase we noticed in gait parameters during the use of BeatMove, compared to other solutions, could be linked to the motivational effect of real-time phase synchronization with music. Indeed, BeatMove is the only existing device synchronizing music and gait not only in frequency but also in phase, which is a major difference. While both frequency and phase synchronization are important for the successful cueing of biological systems, phase synchronization provides a more detailed and context-specific form of coordination. First, because it ensures that specific events or activities occur at the same point in the oscillatory cycle, it allows for a more precise timing. Second, as it reveals their specific relationships more clearly, it increases the functional connectivity between the two systems, enabling more targeted and efficient communication between them. Third, phase synchronization allows for the transfer of information at specific points in the oscillatory cycle, enabling more efficient and context-specific communication between the two systems. Finally, it increases robustness to frequency variations, making it a valuable mechanism for regulating complex biological processes. The larger increase of speed that we obtained with BeatMove compared to other cueing methods probably results from this step-by-step in-phase synchronization of the musical tempo to the walking cadence. In practice, whatever the motor state of the PwPD, music will pick him up where he is, even in severe "off" states.

### A motor learning-based intervention to ameliorate freezing of gait in subjects with Parkinson's disease [^111oyxW6]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Freezing of gait (FOG) is an episodic gait disturbance that is commonly seen in Parkinson's disease (PD). To date, treatment efficacy is limited. We tested the hypothesis that an intervention that utilizes motor learning provided through intensive cueing can alleviate this symptom. Fifteen subjects with PD suffering from FOG participated in a 6 week progressive motor learning program (three training sessions per week — open trial). A training session included FOG-provoking situations (e.g., turns). Prior to each presumed FOG provocation (e.g., just before a turn), rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) was elicited and the subject was trained to walk rhythmically, coordinate left-right stepping and to increase step size, utilizing the RAS cueing. Net training duration increased from week to week and secondary cognitive tasks while walking were added to increase FOG propensity. FOG symptom burden was assessed before, immediately, and 4 weeks after the training period. The mean number of FOG episodes (± SEM) per 10 m of walking in a standardized gait assessment decreased from 0.52 ± 0.29 in the pre-testing to 0.15 ± 0.04 in the post-testing (p < 0.05). The duration of FOG episodes decreased from 4.3 ± 2.1 to 2.6 ± 0.6 s (p < 0.05). Additional measures (e.g. FOG questionnaire, gait speed) varied in their responsiveness to the treatment. These effects were retained 4 weeks after the training. The results of this open label study support the possibility that a motor learning-based intervention is apparently effective in reducing FOG burden, suggesting that RAS can deliver 'anti-FOG' training.

### Amplifying walking activity in Parkinson's disease through autonomous music-based rhythmic auditory stimulation: randomized controlled trial [^114VopxG]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Both groups demonstrated high adherence during the 6-week walking intervention period. During the 2-week follow-on period, the Amped-PD group maintained high engagement with MR-005, whereas the Active-Control group had a slight reduction in engagement. Our study implemented a relatively short intervention in comparison to usual clinical trials in PD. It is possible that longer intervention durations will reveal more pronounced divergence in adherence rates between groups. Future studies are needed to test this hypothesis.

It is noteworthy that none of the Amped-PD participants experienced any serious adverse events or any fall-related events during 8 weeks of community-based walking at moderate-to-vigorous intensities. In contrast, there were two serious adverse events in the Active-Control intervention involving non-injurious falls during the walking intervention. Specifically, one participant tripped due to a toe catch, and another participant fell due to festinating gait. These occurrences, unfortunately represent common challenges and risks during daily walking in PD. Based on user-reported accounts, Amped-PD participants noted improvements in walking quality such as reduced toe scuffing, longer strides, and prevention of shuffling gait during cued walking. These participant comments align with the observed action of MR-005, which is to improve gait mechanics (quality) during walking. Additionally, MR-005 has an integrated multi-tiered decision-making approach that considers real-time user performance and gait quality to determine appropriate tempo progression (See Methods). Together, these intervention components serve as important safety features that are critical in mitigating some of the inherent risks associated with community walking and gait disability in PD.

### Rhythmic auditory stimulation for reduction of falls in Parkinson's disease: a randomized controlled study [^112HwHhb]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective:

To test whether rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) training reduces the number of falls in Parkinson's disease patients with a history of frequent falls.

Design:

Randomized withdrawal study design.

Subjects:

A total of 60 participants (aged 62–82years) diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (Hoehn and Yahr stages III or IV) with at least two falls in the past 12months.

Intervention:

Participants were randomly allocated to two groups and completed 30minutes of daily home-based gait training with metronome click-embedded music. The experimental group completed 24weeks of RAS training, whereas the control group discontinued RAS training between weeks 8 and 16.

Main Measures:

Changes in clinical and kinematic parameters were assessed at baseline, weeks 8, 16, and 24.

Results:

Both groups improved significantly at week 8. At week 16-after the control group had discontinued training-significant differences between groups emerged including a rise in the fall index for the control group (M = 10, SD = 6). Resumption of training reduced the number of falls so that group differences were no longer significant at week 24 (M experimental = 3, SD = 2.6; M control = 5, SD = 4.4; P > 0.05). Bilateral ankle dorsiflexion was significantly correlated with changes in gait, fear of falling, and the fall index, indicating ankle flexion as a potential kinematic mechanism RAS addresses to reduce falls.

Conclusion:

RAS training significantly reduced the number of falls in Parkinson's disease and modified key gait parameters, such as velocity and stride length.

### Amplifying walking activity in Parkinson's disease through autonomous music-based rhythmic auditory stimulation: randomized controlled trial [^113EA6bA]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Building on our prior work, the current study was an 8-week prospective, assessor blinded randomized controlled trial with experimental and active control arms. It was designed to more rigorously examine the effects of autonomous RAS system for increasing daily moderate intensity walking, daily amount of walking, and improving stride time variability (STV, an indicator of walking automaticity and disability,) in persons with PD. We also were interested in examining the habit-strengthening potential of walking with autonomous RAS system for promoting regular moderate intensity walking. Participants in both arms were first instructed to engage in six weeks of routine real-world walking in the community. For participants in the experimental "Amped-PD" group, the walking intervention was delivered via MR-005. For participants in the Active-Control group, no specific delivery modality was used. For the final 2-week "follow-on" period of the trial, both groups engaged in real-world walking as desired, without specific instructions from or monitoring by the research team. We hypothesize that engaging in the Amped-PD intervention compared to the Active-Control intervention will generate larger gains in moderate intensity walking and consequently higher daily steps during the 6-week intervention and 2-week follow-on periods. We further hypothesize that moderate walking intensity and daily steps will return to baseline following the withdrawal of the RAS intervention at study completion. These gains will be accompanied by larger training-related improvements in gait rhythmicity (reduced stride time variability) and stronger habits for walking in favor of the Amped-PD intervention over the Active-Control intervention.

### Rhythmic abilities and musical training in Parkinson's disease: do they help? [^113ByTry]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Rhythmic auditory cues can immediately improve gait in Parkinson's disease. However, this effect varies considerably across patients. The factors associated with this individual variability are not known to date. Patients' rhythmic abilities and musicality (e.g., perceptual and singing abilities, emotional response to music, and musical training) may foster a positive response to rhythmic cues. To examine this hypothesis, we measured gait at baseline and with rhythmic cues in 39 non-demented patients with Parkinson's disease and 39 matched healthy controls. Cognition, rhythmic abilities and general musicality were assessed. A response to cueing was qualified as positive when the stimulation led to a clinically meaningful increase in gait speed. We observed that patients with positive response to cueing (n = 17) were more musically trained, aligned more often their steps to the rhythmic cues while walking, and showed better music perception as well as poorer cognitive flexibility than patients with non-positive response (n = 22). Gait performance with rhythmic cues worsened in six patients. We concluded that rhythmic and musical skills, which can be modulated by musical training, may increase beneficial effects of rhythmic auditory cueing in Parkinson's disease. Screening patients in terms of musical/rhythmic abilities and musical training may allow teasing apart patients who are likely to benefit from cueing from those who may worsen their performance due to the stimulation.

### Rhythmic abilities and musical training in Parkinson's disease: do they help? [^115WThuz]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

To date there are no guidelines for using RAC as an individualized clinical tool. The ability to track the beat of rhythmic cues may allow predicting a patient's response to cueing, as suggested for healthy young adults. Moreover, other aspects of musicality such as perceptual skills, emotional response to music, and musical training, as well as clinical and cognitive functioning may also modulate the beneficial effect of cueing. To this end, we examined patients' individual gait response to various rhythmic stimuli, tested their motor and non-motor rhythmic performance, and assessed their general musicality. The differences between patients with positive response (PR) and non-positive response (NPR) to cueing were examined. The ultimate goal was to provide guidelines to identify patients who will most likely benefit from RAC, while excluding those patients who are at risk of seeing their performance worsened by cueing.

### Gait ecological assessment in persons with Parkinson's disease engaged in a synchronized musical rehabilitation program [^114nWCwr]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

With real-time measurement of performances through digital mobility outcomes, PwPDs can track their progress. This can serve as an additional motivational tool to encourage the maintenance of exercise over time. Furthermore, for research purposes this tracking can provide critical data to optimize the duration and intensity of the program –.

Using music instead of a metronome, with the personalized choice of music genresis enjoyable and rewarding –. Enjoyment is a predictor of physical activity participation and adherence. Reactivating the dysfunctional dopaminergic reward systemin PwPDs could be especially useful. Musical cueing could induce a restoration of gait rhythmicity, increasing the activity of basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits or activating compensatory cerebello-thalamo-cortical loops.

Impairment of rhythmic skills is associated, for some PwPDs, with a poor immediate response to rhythmic cues, likely due to a detrimental dual-tasking effect. Poor synchronization capacities are also associated with a less pronounced longer-term effect of cueing in a rehabilitation protocol. BeatMove delivers real-time music beats, temporally adjusted to the steps of the PwPDs' in phase. This synchronized music allows the beneficial effect of cueing in all PwPDs, even those with impaired rhythmic skills.

The possibility to alleviate motor impairments of PwPDs with auditory cueing is known since the seminal work of Thaut et al. (1993). Providing an external clock would be prone to compensated for self-initiated and self-paced movements timing difficulties due to basal ganglia dysfunction. The missing internal cue would be at the origin of PwPDs difficulty to initiate and maintain cyclic movements such as walking. The explanatory hypotheses which apply to PwPDs' improved gait performance under the influence of auditory stimulation are twofold and not mutually exclusive: (i) the residual activation of the basal ganglia by auditory cueing, and (ii) the compensatory mechanisms which originate from Supplementary Motor Area (SMA) – and/or from the cerebellum. The existence of compensatory mechanisms, such as the overactivation of the cerebellumand motor cortexmeasured with neuroimaging in PwPDs during sensory-motor coordination, raises the question of their evocation by auditory stimulation. In support of these hypothesis, the cerebellar hyper-activation negatively correlated with the activation of the contralateral putamen during auditory-paced movements, and progresses with the disease.

### Amplifying walking activity in Parkinson's disease through autonomous music-based rhythmic auditory stimulation: randomized controlled trial [^111aywkU]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Habitual moderate intensity walking has disease-modifying benefits in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the lack of sustainable gait interventions that collectively promote sufficient intensity, daily amount, and quality of walking marks a critical gap in PD rehabilitation. In this randomized controlled trial (clinicaltrials.gov#: NCT05421624, registered on June 6, 2022), we demonstrate the effectiveness of a real-world walking intervention delivered using an autonomous music-based digital rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) system. In comparison to an active-control arm (N = 20) of moderately intense brisk walking, the autonomous RAS system used in the experimental arm (N = 21) amplified moderate-to-vigorous walking intensities, increased daily steps, and improved (reduced) gait variability. While regular engagement in real-world walking with or without RAS each cultivated habits for walking, only the RAS intervention yielded a combination of strengthened habits and improved gait outcomes. Findings from this study supported the use of a personalized, autonomous RAS gait intervention that is effective, habit-forming and translatable to real-world walking in individuals with PD.

a Components of MR-005 autonomous rhythmic auditory stimulation system. b Instructions on independent use of MR-005 system. c Self-managed real-world walking program. Informed consent was obtained for the use of participant images in the figure.

Each session with MR-005 began with an autonomous baseline assessment of the participant's walking using approximately 20 viable strides as reference to define at what tempo the music should start. Upon successful system calibration, music-based rhythmic cues were introduced, and participants were prompted to "walk to the beat of the music". The closed-loop rhythmic stimulation (Fig. 8C) was then achieved through continuous relay of real-time gait metric data from the shoe-worn sensors to the software to evaluate user's entrainment (i.e. alignment of walking to music tempo), gait variability, and gait symmetry. A participant's successful achievement of entrainment and gait quality criteria referenced to proprietary thresholds prompted the algorithm to progress music tempos by 5% at two-minute intervals. If the system determined that user's gait did not meet performance criteria, it superimposed an additional rhythmic cue over the music until performance improved. As needed, the system also reduced the tempo to better align with participant's cadence, thereby enhancing the likelihood that they could "re-entrain". Once gait performance improved, system algorithms would again progress the music tempo. Walking with rhythmic cueing provided by MR-005 application was automatically capped at 30 minutes

Intervention of control arm: active-control intervention

Participants in the Active-Control intervention were instructed to engage in walking in the community as the Amped PD group, but without using MR-005 or any RAS. They were instructed to walk at self-selected speeds slightly faster than their comfortable speed. Participants were asked to monitor the duration of their walking sessions using their personal watch or digital timer.

### Rhythmic abilities and musical training in Parkinson's disease: do they help? [^117KTWAY]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Effects of RAC on gait

At baseline, patients exhibited lower gait velocity and bilateral coordination, shorter stride length, and higher gait variability than controls (Table 2). The two groups were comparable in terms of cadence. Patients and controls increased their cadence and their velocity in trials with cueing.

a For a difference between patients and controls at pre-test

In spite of the aforementioned group effects of RAC, there were important inter-individual differences (Fig. 1). Participants were divided into two categories based on their response to RAC relative to the baseline. An improvement in gait speed larger than the smallest clinically significant difference in PD (0.06 m/s) characterized participants with a PR to cueing. Participants with a smaller or a negative difference were considered as participants with a NPR. Finally, a reduction in gait speed by more than the smallest clinically significant difference in PD (0.06 m/s)characterized participants with a negative response (NR) to cueing.

Fig. 1
Individual responses to rhythmic cueing expressed as the difference in gait speed between cueing and the baseline, in patients with Parkinson's disease and controls. Patients who aligned their steps to the beat also increased their speed; this is not the case of controls

Twenty-two patients and 20 controls had a PR to cueing, while 17 patients and 19 controls showed a NPR. In particular, six patients and six controls showed a NR with a significant worsening of gait performance (−0.18 ± 0.09 m/s and −0.17 ± 0.11 m/s, respectively). Patients spontaneously synchronized their steps to the beat more often than controls did (synchronization score: 0.40 ± 0.34 vs. 0.20 ± 0.26, respectively; t (73.7) = 3.01, p < 0.01). Better step synchronization to the beat was associated to greater improvement with cueing in patients (R² = 0.16, F (1, 37) = 7.1, p = 0.01) but not in controls (R² = 0.002, F < 1, p = 0.78).

### Group-based music intervention in Parkinson's disease-findings from a mixed-methods study [^113ExrUt]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study shows that the group-based music intervention may add value to psychological aspects such as mood, alertness, and quality of life, in patients with Parkinson's disease. The study does not, however, support the efficacy of the therapy in producing immediate or lasting improvements in motor-cognitive dual-tasking, cognitive function, balance, or freezing of gait, when compared with the control group. Supplementary interviews revealed that small improvements were noted by patients and therapists in the intervention group, but none were reproduced in the functional tests. The results therefore suggest that the Ronnie Gardiner Method should not be adopted in clinical practice in preference to more robust evidence-based movement therapies, including dancing, in Parkinson's disease.

There are several possible reasons to consider with respect to why the intervention was not effective. First, the focus was on stability and movement quality, and the challenge of the exercises may therefore have been too low to improve balance during dual-task conditions. Second, the intervention was not individualized, which meant that the group could only progress at the rate of the poorest responder in the group. This was frustrating to some patients, and the therapists found it difficult to negotiate the right level of challenge. A more personalized approach would most likely improve the conditions for training effects. Finally, the short-term improvement for quality of life and the reduction of concerns about falling may be due to the placebo effect, especially since no cognitive or motor outcomes were improved in the intervention group compared to the control group. It should also be considered that the study was underpowered and had a large amount of missing data, which makes the results less clear.

### Evaluation of compensation strategies for gait impairment in patients with parkinson disease [^112Syw49]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Gait impairment is common and disabling in individuals with Parkinson disease (PD). Reduced stride length, increased gait variability, and reduced arm swing are examples of continuous gait deficits that typically occur in persons with PD. As the disease progresses, episodic gait deficits, including freezing of gait (FOG) and festination, can also come into play. The presence of gait impairment often leads to falls and fall-related injuries and significantly affects functional mobility, independence, and quality of life.

As dopaminergic medication and deep brain stimulation (DBS) usually have an only moderate effect on gait impairment, the application of compensation strategies has become an essential part of gait rehabilitation in PD. These strategies are typically self-invented by persons with PD and comprise a wide range of "detours" to overcome gait impairment and improve functional mobility. Examples include improved gait when walking to the beat of music, counting while walking, walking backward, climbing stairs, or when walking on a floor with a specific visual pattern. While often applied in the context of FOG, compensation strategies also improve continuous gait deficits.

To date, compensation strategies in PD have usually been reported in the form of anecdotal case reports. With the exception of external cueing (e.g. rhythmic auditory stimulation), the efficacy of these strategies has rarely been investigated in a systematic manner. In 2019, a comprehensive framework of 7 distinct categories of strategies was proposed: external cueing, internal cueing, changing the balance requirements, altering the mental state, action observation or motor imagery, adopting a new walking pattern, and alternatives to walking. This framework served as the basis for a large-scale survey on the perception of compensation strategies in 4,324 persons with PD and gait impairment, providing Class IV evidence that compensation strategies are effective. However, the study also confirmed that the efficacy of specific strategies varies per person, highlighting the need for an individually tailored approach. It is still insufficiently understood what the underlying working mechanisms of these strategies are and which patient characteristics may be associated with the individual efficacy of the various compensation strategies. This is hampering the ability of healthcare professionals to provide much-needed personalized gait rehabilitation.

### Amplifying walking activity in Parkinson's disease through autonomous music-based rhythmic auditory stimulation: randomized controlled trial [^114sf5FW]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Participants

Participants were recruited from the Greater Boston area and surrounding New England locales through patient registries at the BU Center for Neurorehabilitation, patient support groups, Parkinson newsletters, flyers, and through word-of-mouth. Participants with idiopathic, typical Parkinson's disease were included based on the following inclusion criteria: 40–85 years of age, mild to moderate disease severity (Modified Hoehn & Yahr stages 1–3), able to walk independently without physical assistance or an assistive device for at least 10 min, and stable PD medications for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment. We excluded those who were less than 40 years of age, had atypical Parkinsonism, had moderately or significantly disturbing freezing of gait during daily walking based on the New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire(i.e. self-reported scoring of 2: Moderately or 3: Significantly on item 7 which asks "How disturbing are the freezing episodes for your daily walking?), had a history of more than one fall for any reason or a singular fall that was PD-related over the previous 3 months, had a Mini-Mental State Exam score less than 24, had self-reported significant hearing impairment, or who reported the presence of other orthopedic, neurologic, and medical conditions that impacted walking and mobility. Individuals who were receiving ongoing physical therapy for gait rehabilitation at the time of the study and those who were already performing regular walking > 3x/week for at least 30 minutes also were excluded.

Randomization and blinding

Upon completing the baseline assessment (i.e. first study visit), participants were randomly assigned to either the Amped-PD group or the Active-Control group. Randomization was accomplished using REDCap-generated sequences of equal sizes between groups. The allocation list was concealed from researchers, and group allocation was fully automated through REDCap, randomization module. All clinical assessments (i.e. baseline, 6-week, 8-week) were performed by research physical therapists (NW, TCB) who were blinded to participant group assignment. All intervention-related procedures were managed separately by an unblinded interventionist/physical therapist (JAZ). Participants were not blinded to the intervention and were advised to avoid discussing or disclosing their group assignment with blinded assessors to ensure overall fidelity of blinding.

Effects of Amped-PD and Active-Control interventions on daily walking based on walking amount (step counts).

a Between-group comparisons on changes in daily step counts. b Within-subject comparisons on daily step counts by group. Red bars refer to Amped-PD. Gray bars refer to Active-Control. Blue dashed line denotes minimum detectable change (MDC) in daily steps relative to baseline. Values equal or greater than the MDC line signify change in daily steps that is greater than measurement error. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation.

With regard to within-group changes, the Amped-PD group (Fig. 4B) also demonstrated significant increases in daily steps (χ²(3) = 30.78, p < 0.001) during both the walking intervention period (12155 ± 3127 steps, Ζ = 1.60, p = 0.001) and follow-on period (11346 ± 2655 steps, Ζ = 1.15, p = 0.029) relative to their baseline (8812 ± 3542 steps). The increases were not maintained at the completion of study when MR-005 was no longer available (Ζ = 0.35, p = 1.00). The Active-Control group had no significant within-group changes in daily steps during the walking intervention or follow-on periods, albeit the results approach significance (χ²(3) = 7.73, p = 0.052), which was mainly due to a reduction in daily steps at study completion.

### A double-blind, controlled trial of circadian effective light therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease [^117DCe5a]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite current medical therapy for Parkinson's Disease (PD), many experience persistent motor symptoms and significant unmanaged non-motor issues. Previous studies suggest that light therapy (LT) provides benefits for motor and non-motor features of PD. This study evaluated Circadian Effective LT (CELT) with a spectral band between 460 and 545 ​nm for the motor and non-motor features of PD. We conducted a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial of CELT in people with Parkinson's disease on standard-of-care therapy. Ninety-two participants (45 active, 47 control) were randomized 1:1 to active or control CELT for 1 ​h each evening for 6 months. Patients were evaluated in their 'ON state'. The mean (SE) change on the primary endpoint of the MDS-UPDRS parts 1–3 was -17.7(2.8) active vs -9.7(3.5) control, for a LSM difference of -8.0 (4.4) (p ​ = ​0.074, 95% Confidence Interval: -16.7, 0.8), reflecting a trend toward improvement over control. Key secondary endpoints included PDQ-39 and CGI which favored active treatment (-5.7 ​ ± ​2.7; p ​ = ​0.038, and -0.4 ​ ± ​0.2; p ​ = ​0.066 respectively), while PDSS-2 Disturbed Sleep showed no difference between groups. Other secondary endpoints that supported the overall treatment effect of CELT included ESS (-1.52 ​ ± ​0.78; p ​ = ​0.054) and CGI-E (-0.3 ​ ± ​0.2; p ​ = ​0.088). Daily LT, with a circadian effective targeted spectrum of light, was well tolerated by PD patients, had no serious adverse effects and showed improvement in both motor and non-motor MDS-UPDRS and other scores. Larger double-blind studies are warranted to further assess the effectiveness of CELT in PD. CLINICALTRIALS.GOV REGISTRATION: NCT02175472.

### Gait ecological assessment in persons with Parkinson's disease engaged in a synchronized musical rehabilitation program [^116ZAaas]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

PD is associated with impaired rhythmic skills. PwPDs are not always able to synchronize correctly their movements to the beat of the music. A synchronization deficit can induce a deleterious effect of musical cueing on PwPDs' gait. An adaptive cueing, synchronizing in real-time the music tempo and beats to PwPDs' steps could allow a beneficial effect even in PwPDs with altered beat perception. An important added value of this approach is to ensure the personalization of the stimulation.

We recently developed a music-based digital solution called BeatMove (Originally called BeatWalk, the application has been renamed BeatMove in 2022), able to deliver an adapted music, synchronized in real-time with the PwPDs' gait. The app delivers interactive musical stimulation, finding the optimal compromise between PwPDs' individual rhythmic capacities and the stimulus features. One major functionality of its algorithm is that the music tempo overall stays aligned with the walking tempo at all times, allowing a continuous synchronization (in frequency and in phase) between the step and the musical beat, which maximizes the cueing benefits. The real-time control of the beat-step relative phase is used to attract walkers toward a target cadence which is defined as the cadence measured during the first minute of walking +10%. The temporal gap between the foot landing and the occurrence of the musical beat is finely tuned so that the beat is delivered slightly before each foot contacts the ground, as long as the PwPDs walks at a cadence lower than the target one. As PwPDs increase their step frequency, the gap between beat occurrence and foot contact shortens. This is a subliminal manipulation which allows to reach a target value of +10% of the spontaneous walking cadence, yielding a faster and more stable walking pattern of PwPDs. This parametrization of the system (+10%) allows the best compromise between the maintenance of a given frequency and the tendency of the adaptive stimulus to cooperate. By only partially closing the gap between their cadence and the targeted one, PwPDs could experiment with a significant phase change. BeatMove, therefore, promotes physical activity through performance feedback (e.g. traveled distance, duration, and number of sessions) and the pleasure of music listening. It allows PwPDs to walk outdoors while listening to step-synchronized music of various genres. The use of BeatMove for 1-month in the rehabilitation program called BeatPark (The BeatPark rehabilitation program consisted of 30-minute walking sessions, without a cane or human assistance, outdoor, five times a week, for 4 weeks.) has produced an improvement in PwPDs' performances on a Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), measured in a laboratory setting, before and after this program, in a silent condition.

### Amplifying walking activity in Parkinson's disease through autonomous music-based rhythmic auditory stimulation: randomized controlled trial [^116zBXUq]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Finally, the Amped-PD group perceived the walking intervention to be more helpful in improving overall walking and physical activity than the Active-Control group, based on their higher scores on the Global Rating of Change scale. This rating was complemented by our user experience interview data, revealing a prominent theme related to physical benefits and functional improvements following the Amped-PD intervention. The interview data also revealed a favorable influence on affect, where participants reported enjoyment, motivation, and engagement related to the walking intervention. Positive impact on one's affect is important in promoting long-term engagement, and enjoyment related to music cues has been shown to even have associated gait improvements in people with PD. Finally, we also obtained user feedback on technology considerations that would further enhance the user experience. Participants valued the integration of encouraging prompts commonly used by physical therapists in gait rehabilitation, and the ability to select specific songs instead of music genre. These suggestions highlight the value placed on personalized gait interventions. All in all, these data indicated an overall positive user experience on engaging in a community-based walking intervention with the autonomous music-based RAS system.

Altogether, our study findings suggest that music-based RAS facilitates more typical walking patterns in PD and enhancing rhythmicity (reduced variability) that are likely to help individuals sustain walking activities at greater amounts and intensities. The heterogeneity of motor problems across individuals, as well as variations in walking for each individual due to task, environment, and other personal factors critically underscores the need for a personalized gait interventions. Our study findings offer preliminary evidence in support of the potential of an autonomous, music-based RAS system in providing a personalized approach that is sustainable, effective, and engaging.

Our study has several limitations. The intervention duration utilized in this study was relatively short. Subsequent studies with longer treatment durations are needed to explore its impact on long-term adherence to walking intervention and to examine training-related effects on other gait and clinical outcomes. Next, our study participants included people with PD who were relatively high functioning based on walking capacity and performance. While our results show encouraging findings impacting walking activity, gait quality, and habit formation, future studies should examine the effects of this intervention on participants who have greater levels of gait disability and disease severity to enhance generalization of results.

### Abnormal phasic activity in saliency network, motor areas, and basal ganglia in Parkinson's disease during rhythm perception [^114Cm9KY]. Human Brain Mapping (2019). Medium credibility.

2.4 Experimental design

Before scanning, the participants underwent familiarization with the sound of the stimuli and the sound of the scanner. The stimuli were presented via headphones from a laptop computer. The familiarization consisted of playing a recording of scanner noise alone, musical excerpts of the rhythms used in the study (approx. 20 s) without scanner noise, and musical excerpts superimposed on top of scanner noise (approx. 20 s). This was followed by a short explanation of a covert attentional oddball omission task for a second part of the study, not further described or analyzed in this article (this analysis will be reported elsewhere and is simply referred to as "oddball" later in this article). For the second part of the familiarization period, the participants were provided with protective in‐ear foam plugs and the volume of the presentation was turned up to simulate the experience of the sound levels in the scanner, to minimize surprise for the participants in the scanner. All participants indicated that they could clearly hear the stimuli.

The participants kept the in‐ear foam plugs in place and were escorted to the scanner room, where they were placed comfortably in the scanner and fitted with MRI‐compatible headphones with additional physical noise cancelation‐foamed shells, and MRI‐compatible video goggles. During stimulus presentation of the first 16 s analyzed in this article, participants listening passively without performing any additional task. The presentation of stimuli and synchronization with the scanner was implemented in E‐Prime (Ver 2.3 Professional, Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA).

Before each trail, a short written instruction was presented via goggles ("Get ready", 4.5 s), followed by a blank screen and a silence period ranging (jittered) from 13 to 19 s. At the start of each music stimulus, a small fixation cross appeared in the goggles to minimize head movement. Each stimulus (two rhythms in two modalities) was presented 4 times during the scan, and the sequence of stimuli was randomized. The total scan time was 33 min ([4.5 s READ + 13~19 s jittered SILENCE + 16 s LISTENING + 88 s oddball] × 16 stimuli blocks). See Figure 1 for a schematic representation of the paradigm and stimulus presentation.

### Amplifying walking activity in Parkinson's disease through autonomous music-based rhythmic auditory stimulation: randomized controlled trial [^114G8mR3]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

PD research over the last several decades has included a focus on rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS), a rehabilitation intervention leveraging the potent effects of auditory-motor entrainment to facilitate rhythmicity and stability in motor control during walking –. Auditory-motor entrainment bypasses the internal rhythm deficits related to PD basal ganglia dysfunctionby accessing cerebellar pathways involved in movement regulation. Further, RAS facilitates gait-related sensory-motor processing in the parietal areas. RAS improves gait quality by increasing stride length, improving the timing of leg muscle activation, and reducing step variability, which together enable faster walking speeds, and moderate intensity walking. While clinical studies have supported RAS-based intervention. its translation to real-world environments has been limitedby barriers associated with its traditionally open-loop approach. In this approach, a trained individual is required to select and manually adjust isochronous (i.e. fixed tempo) rhythmic cues based on their evaluation of user gait characteristics. Further, the open-loop approach requires high levels of user vigilance, is prone to error accumulation, and fails to adapt to changing contexts and environments. Recent advances in user-worn digital technology have spawned the development of closed-loop (personalized) RAS systems, which autonomous deliver individualized cues based on user's real-time gait performance. Closed-loop RAS fosters natural and stable entrainment, thereby making them potentially suitable for sustaining moderate-intensity walking and improving gait quality. However, the potential of closed-loop RAS interventions for reducing walking disability in PD has received only preliminary scientific scrutiny to date. Moreover, the effectiveness of closed-loop RAS used in real-world applications directed at increasing daily walking activity (e.g. daily walking intensity and amount) has not been examined.

### Group-based music intervention in Parkinson's disease-findings from a mixed-methods study [^1178MGJR]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective:

To evaluate a group-based music intervention in patients with Parkinson's disease.

Design:

Parallel group randomized controlled trial with qualitative triangulation.

Setting:

Neurorehabilitation in primary care.

Subjects:

Forty-six patients with Parkinson's disease were randomized into intervention group (n = 26), which received training with the music-based intervention, and control group (n = 20) without training.

Interventions:

The intervention was delivered twice weekly for 12 weeks.

Main measures:

Primary outcome was Timed-Up-and-Go subtracting serial 7's (dual-task ability). Secondary outcomes were cognition, balance, concerns about falling, freezing of gait, and quality of life. All outcomes were evaluated at baseline, post-intervention, and three months post-intervention. Focus groups and individual interviews were conducted with the intervention group and with the delivering physiotherapists.

Results:

No between-group differences were observed for dual-task ability. Between-group differences were observed for Falls Efficacy Scale (mean difference (MD) = 6.5 points; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.0 to 10.0, P = 0.001) and for Parkinson Disease Questionnaire-39 items (MD = 8.3; 95% CI = 2.7 to 13.8, P = 0.005) when compared to the control group post-intervention, but these were not maintained at three months post-intervention. Three themes were derived from the interviews: Expectations versus Results, Perspectives on Treatment Contents, and Key Factors for Success.

Conclusion:

Patient-reported outcomes and interviews suggest that the group-based music intervention adds value to mood, alertness, and quality of life in patients with Parkinson's disease. The study does not support the efficacy in producing immediate or lasting gains in dual-tasking, cognition, balance, or freezing of gait.

### Home-based exergaming to treat gait and balance disorders in patients with Parkinson's disease: a phase II randomized controlled trial [^117Qy7WL]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Procedures

Patients had an assessment at inclusion (baseline), followed by randomization to the Active training or Control group for 6–9 weeks (Figure 1, single‐blind period). During this single‐blind period, patients played with the videogame 'Toap Run' designed to treat gait and balance disorders for PD patients, 2–3 times/week for a total of 18 sessions. The first two sessions took place at the institute, and the two following at home with a research assistant. Subsequently, patients played independently at home using a web‐based platform. Participants were allowed to contact the investigator by telephone if needed.

FIGURE 1
Flowchart of the study design.

The Active training group played with full‐body movements performed upright in front of a RGB‐D Kinect® motion sensor (Version 2, Microsoft, USA). The motion sensor was placed below a television screen, positioned approximately 2 m in front of the patient. The Control group played seated with a keyboard without any physical efforts. The participants' movements (Active) or keyboard pushes (Control) induced the displacements of a small animal (the avatar) in real time, to gain points by collecting coins and avoiding obstacles (Methods in Appendix S1; Figure 2). For Active training, the required movements consisted of large amplitude and rapid movements of all four limbs, pelvis, and trunk, with lateral, vertical, and forward displacements of the legs, to reinforce foot lifting and postural control. Visual (schematic representation of movements) and auditory (rhythmic music) cues were used to encourage movements. Patients received real‐time and online feedback while playing, in the form of an auditory or visual stimulus. In addition, their performance was graded at the end of each session.

Intervention of experimental arm: Amped-PD intervention

Participants in the Amped PD group were instructed to use MR-005 during the 6-week walking intervention period (Fig. 8A–C; informed consent obtained for use of participant images in the figure). MR-005 was designed to leverage auditory-motor entrainment to deliver rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) and improve walking performance in people with PD. System components included a pair of shoe-worn inertial sensors, a bone-conducting headset, and a hand-held touchscreen device that housed proprietary software including the auditory stimuli (Fig. 8A). The system played popular and familiar music based on each user's preferred music genre (e.g. classic rock, country, oldies, etc.), with songs proprietarily screened for therapeutic utility by the manufacturer. Participants allocated to the Amped-PD intervention received instruction on how to independently operate the MR-005 system on their first study visit, immediately following their baseline assessment (Fig. 8B). Instructions included proper wear of shoe sensors and headset, device initialization, and charging of system components. Participants were instructed to walk with the MR-005 system on generally level surface suitable for long straight ahead walking, in environments with minimal obstacles as possible (e.g. pedestrian traffic, vehicles, pets, and other safety hazards).

Introduction

Improving walking is a top priority for enhancing quality of life in people with Parkinson disease (PD). The chronic and degenerative nature of PD requires easily accessible and sustainable interventions that effectively delay or reverse walking disability –. Habitual walking at moderate intensities in sufficient quantities can alleviate motor symptoms in PD and promote improvements in gait and balance. However, regular engagement in moderate intensity walking can be challenging for people with PD, who typically experience motor (e.g. loss of walking automaticity, bradykinesia) and non-motor (e.g. depression, lack of motivation) impairments. Commonly impaired gait quality mechanics in PD, such as increased variability in stepping patterns, limit walking stability and further contribute to gait disability in PD. The development of rehabilitation interventions to address this complex array of neurophysiologic impairments, limited real-world walking performance, and reduced engagement in society is needed to counter gait disability.
