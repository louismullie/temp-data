## Question

peritonsillar abscess vs. retropharyngeal abscess

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about peritonsillar abscess (PTA) versus retropharyngeal abscess (RPA). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about epidemiology and who gets each condition. Then, I should examine anatomy and pathophysiology to understand origin and spread. Next, I will assess clinical presentation and key bedside differentiators. After that, I need to check microbiology and empiric coverage. I will now examine diagnostic strategies, including when to use ultrasound, CT, or MRI. Then, I should review treatment pathways, including medical versus surgical decisions. I need to ensure I cover complications and prognosis. Finally, I will consider special populations and mimics, especially Kawasaki disease, and synthesize practical decision points with airway safety up front [^114YnPGN] [^111ztnzF] [^113Lfefc] [^113xyjrB] [^1146d9xE].

> Let me first confirm the epidemiology to anchor pretest probabilities. PTA is the most common deep infection of the head and neck, occurring primarily in adolescents and young adults and often managed as an outpatient problem, with large U.S. datasets showing tens of thousands of ED visits annually and a slight male predominance, which supports a typical adult distribution for PTA [^114YnPGN] [^112QmHFN]. Hold on, I should verify RPA demographics; in contrast, RPA is predominantly a pediatric disease with the highest incidence in children under 5 years and boys, with national data showing rising incidence across early childhood, underscoring that age is a powerful differentiator at presentation [^111ztnzF]. But wait, what if an adult has RPA? Adults can develop RPA, often as a complication of spread from other deep spaces or PTA, and concurrent RPA among adult inpatients with PTA has increased over time, so I should not exclude it solely on age in the appropriate clinical context [^1112HiCE].

> Next, I should review anatomy and pathophysiology to anticipate routes of spread. PTA localizes to the peritonsillar space between the tonsillar capsule and superior constrictor; pathogenesis likely begins with tonsillar mucosal infection and may involve Weber gland ducts superiorly, reconciling the historic tonsillitis and salivary gland hypotheses, which explains the frequent superior pole location and clinical contiguity to the oropharynx [^115rm58v]. Let me verify the RPA origin; in children, RPA often originates in retropharyngeal lymph nodes, whereas in adults it more commonly represents extension from peritonsillar or parapharyngeal spaces, and crucially, PTA can rupture or track into parapharyngeal and retropharyngeal spaces with potential caudal spread to the mediastinum, which escalates the level of concern and surgical urgency [^112NUAnU] [^113Lfefc].

> Now, I need to compare clinical presentations carefully. PTA typically presents with severe unilateral sore throat, trismus, muffled "hot potato" voice, drooling, dysphagia, and a peritonsillar bulge with contralateral uvular deviation on exam, and these features often drive a largely clinical diagnosis at the bedside in adults and older children [^114YnPGN] [^111NWu5Q]. Wait, let me consider RPA signals; RPA more often features fever, sore throat, neck pain with refusal to flex or torticollis, drooling, and potentially stridor or obstructive sleep symptoms, and in infants can present subtly with sleep apnea or poor oral intake, which should heighten my suspicion despite minimal intraoral findings [^114D2awn] [^116XhcMZ] [^116hn24L]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; bilateral PTA can blunt classic asymmetry and uvular deviation, so absence of lateralizing oropharyngeal signs does not fully exclude PTA if other features like trismus and toxic appearance are present [^117SkuSa] [^1123pePp].

> I should double-check the microbiology because it drives empiric therapy. Both PTA and RPA are typically polymicrobial, with Group A Streptococcus and oral anaerobes predominating and a high prevalence of beta-lactamase–producing organisms, so empiric regimens should cover streptococci and anaerobes with beta-lactamase stability or a beta-lactam plus inhibitor while awaiting cultures if obtained [^112E9xSX]. Let me reconsider whether microbiology differentiates the two; there is no robust, consistent organism-level separation between PTA and RPA in most series, so clinical context and anatomy, not culture patterns, guide distinctions and management urgency [^112E9xSX].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach and the role of imaging. For PTA, diagnosis is primarily clinical, and when uncertainty exists, intraoral or transcervical ultrasound can accurately confirm or exclude pus and guide drainage, reducing CT use and ED length of stay; CT may assist when deep extension or equivocal bedside findings exist, and certain CT features such as ring enhancement and larger size may predict successful drainage, but routine CT can increase resource use without improving core outcomes, so I should reserve it for specific indications [^114YnPGN] [^116v588D] [^115Rs4Hx] [^114nyk2c] [^111JjPxg]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said CT is mandatory for PTA; that would be incorrect — ultrasound and clinical assessment are often sufficient, with CT reserved for atypical or complicated cases, which I should emphasize explicitly [^116v588D] [^114YnPGN]. For RPA, contrast-enhanced CT of the neck is generally the most helpful and widely used diagnostic test to define extent and plan drainage, whereas MRI can struggle to distinguish pus from edema and may require sedation in younger children, so I need to balance diagnostic clarity with logistics and safety; point-of-care ultrasound may assist in select pediatric cases, but CT remains the practical standard in most settings [^114D2awn] [^113Lfefc] [^116RdRPM] [^114E9zaH].

> I will now examine treatment pathways and the decision to drain. For PTA, drainage plus antibiotics has long been standard, but evidence shows that medical therapy alone can be effective in many patients, with about 73% success and low short-term complication rates, and randomized evidence has not conclusively favored needle aspiration over incision and drainage, so individualized decisions based on severity, abscess size, trismus, and setting are reasonable, often allowing outpatient care with close follow-up and adjunct steroids for symptom relief in selected cases [^1146d9xE] [^113xyjrB] [^114YnPGN] [^111vbxJo]. I should confirm the RPA strategy; RPA typically requires hospital admission, intravenous antibiotics, airway vigilance, and a relatively low threshold for operative drainage, with nearly half of pediatric cases undergoing surgery and higher morbidity than PTA, so delays in escalation can carry real risk and warrant early ENT involvement [^111ztnzF] [^111J2t18]. But wait, what if imaging suggests nonpurulent retropharyngeal edema, such as in some viral or COVID-related contexts? Conservative management may be sufficient when carefully selected by imaging and clinical stability, but this should not distract from the need to secure the airway and rule out true abscess or mediastinal spread when in doubt [^1179tHGB] [^116HNG1U] [^111YYvW6].

> Next, I should review complications and prognosis to calibrate urgency. PTA generally has low mortality and is often outpatient, but it can extend into parapharyngeal or retropharyngeal spaces and, rarely, lead to catastrophic complications like mediastinitis or even intracranial seeding such as brain abscess, which is why recognizing deep extension is pivotal and may change operative planning and imaging scope to include the mediastinum when indicated [^114YnPGN] [^113Lfefc] [^111YYvW6] [^115SCzKM]. I need to ensure I quantify RPA risk; adult nationwide data show higher morbidity around 10–16% and mortality around 1–3% for para/retropharyngeal abscesses, with frequent needs for airway procedures and intensive care, underscoring that RPA is not just "another sore throat" but a deep neck infection with real potential for deterioration, including stridor and airway compromise at the bedside exam [^111J2t18] [^116XhcMZ].

> Hold on, I should verify important mimics and special populations that change management. Kawasaki disease can mimic RPA radiographically with retropharyngeal low-density lesions lacking rim enhancement and mass effect, remain febrile despite antibiotics, and present with neck pain or torticollis before classic KD features evolve; labs may show higher CRP/AST/ALT and lower WBC versus true RPA, and these cases respond to IVIG rather than antibiotics or drainage, so after about 48–72 hours of antibiotics without improvement and with suggestive imaging, I should reconsider KD to avoid unnecessary surgery and prevent coronary complications through timely IVIG [^113J19cE] [^111sgmKn] [^116KfVHC] [^113PX6Ho] [^116jXQfP]. Let me also consider infectious mononucleosis and bilateral disease; atypical viral-associated peritonsillar infections and bilateral PTA presentations can muddle the picture and may warrant a lower threshold for imaging or ultrasound when classic unilateral findings are absent, to avoid delayed drainage or missed alternative diagnoses [^111jnkjY] [^117SkuSa] [^1123pePp].

> Finally, I need to synthesize practical differentiators with an airway-first mindset. If a young child presents with fever, neck pain, torticollis or refusal to flex, drooling, or stridor and minimal intraoral asymmetry, I should think RPA, secure the airway as needed, obtain contrast-enhanced CT to define extent, start IV antibiotics, and involve ENT early, while remaining vigilant for mediastinal extension on imaging if infrahyoid disease is suspected [^114D2awn] [^116XhcMZ] [^111YYvW6]. If an adolescent or adult presents with severe unilateral sore throat, trismus, muffled voice, and peritonsillar bulge with uvular deviation, I should consider PTA, proceed with bedside ultrasound-guided drainage when appropriate, start antibiotics covering streptococci and anaerobes, and reserve CT for uncertainty or suspected deep extension, with outpatient management feasible in many stable cases and a recognized role for medical therapy alone in selected patients [^114YnPGN] [^116v588D] [^1146d9xE] [^113xyjrB]. Hold on, I should verify one more thing before concluding; because PTA can extend into deep spaces and adults with PTA can develop concomitant RPA, any red flags such as neck rigidity, chest pain, crepitus, or systemic toxicity should prompt imaging escalation and a broader surgical strategy to prevent missed deep neck or mediastinal disease [^1112HiCE] [^113Lfefc] [^111YYvW6].

Peritonsillar abscess (PTA) and retropharyngeal abscess (RPA) are **distinct deep neck infections** [^116RdRPM] with differing clinical features, imaging findings, and management. PTA typically presents with **unilateral peritonsillar swelling, uvular deviation, and trismus** [^114YnPGN] and is treated with needle aspiration or incision and drainage [^113xyjrB] plus antibiotics [^1146d9xE]. RPA presents with **midline posterior pharyngeal bulge, neck stiffness, and stridor** [^116XhcMZ] [^114D2awn], and typically requires CT or MRI for diagnosis [^113Lfefc]; management often includes surgical drainage with airway management [^111J2t18]. PTA is more common in adolescents and young adults [^114YnPGN], whereas RPA predominates in children under 5 years [^111ztnzF]. PTA complications include airway obstruction and Lemierre's syndrome, whereas RPA can cause mediastinitis [^111YYvW6] and epidural abscess.

| **Feature** | **Peritonsillar abscess (PTA)** | **Retropharyngeal abscess (RPA)** |
|-|-|-|

Adjunct corticosteroids provide symptom relief [^113xyjrB] [^1146d9xE] [^114YnPGN] | Airway stabilization and IV antibiotics are initial priorities [^111J2t18]. Surgical drainage via transoral or transcervical approaches is often required [^114D2awn] [^113Lfefc] |
| Complications | Complications include airway obstruction, Lemierre's syndrome, and extension into parapharyngeal or retropharyngeal spaces. PTA can also progress to sepsis [^114YnPGN] [^117XvmsF] [^113Lfefc] | - Airway obstruction <br/> - Mediastinitis [^111YYvW6] <br/> - Epidural abscess <br/> - Sepsis [^114D2awn] [^113Lfefc] |

### Peritonsillar abscess [^114YnPGN]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Peritonsillar abscess is the most common deep infection of the head and neck, occurring primarily in young adults. Diagnosis is usually made based on clinical presentation and examination. Symptoms and findings generally include fever, sore throat, dysphagia, trismus, and a "hot potato" voice. Drainage of the abscess, antibiotic therapy, and supportive therapy for maintaining hydration and pain control are the cornerstones of treatment. Most patients can be managed in the outpatient setting.

Peritonsillar abscesses are polymicrobial infections, and antibiotics effective against group A streptococcus and oral anaerobes should be first-line therapy. Corticosteroids may be helpful in reducing symptoms and speeding recovery. Promptly recognizing the infection and initiating therapy are important to avoid potentially serious complications such as airway obstruction, aspiration, or extension of infection into deep neck tissues.

Patients with peritonsillar abscess are usually first encountered in the primary care outpatient setting or in the emergency department. Family physicians with appropriate training and experience can diagnose and treat most patients with peritonsillar abscess.

### Randomized trial comparing intraoral ultrasound to landmark-based needle aspiration in patients with suspected peritonsillar abscess [^114dEWre]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Traditionally, emergency physicians (EPs) have used anatomic landmark-based needle aspiration to drain peritonsillar abscesses (PTAs). If this method failed, an imaging study and/or consultation with another service for drainage was obtained. Recently, some EPs have used ultrasound (US) to guide PTA drainage. This study seeks to determine which initial approach leads to greater successful drainage.

The primary objective of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of EPs for detecting PTA or peritonsillar cellulitis (PTC) using either intraoral US or initial needle aspiration after visual inspection (the landmark technique [LM]). Secondary objectives included the successful aspiration of purulent material in patients with a PTA in each group, the use of computed tomography (CT) scanning in each group, and the otolaryngology (ENT) consultation rate in each group.

This was a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial of a convenience sample of adult patients who presented to a single, large, urban university hospital. Patients were enrolled if they presented with signs and symptoms that were judged to be a PTA. These patients were randomized to receive intraoral US or to undergo LM drainage. The US was performed using an 8–5 MHz intracavitary transducer immediately prior to the procedure. The probe was then withdrawn, and the provider who performed the US also conducted the needle aspiration. The LM was performed using visual landmarks in a superior to inferior approach until pus was obtained or at least two sticks were completed.

### Microbiology and management of peritonsillar, retropharyngeal, and parapharyngeal abscesses [^112E9xSX]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis, and management of peritonsillar, retropharyngeal, and parapharyngeal abscesses in children. The predominant anaerobic organisms isolated in peritonsillar, lateral pharyngeal, and retropharyngeal abscesses are Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, and Peptostreptococcus species. Aerobic organisms include group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes), Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus influenzae. Anaerobic bacteria can be isolated from most abscesses whenever appropriate techniques for cultivation are used, while S. pyogenes is isolated in only about one third of cases. More than two thirds of deep neck abscesses contain beta-lactamase producing organisms.

Management of tonsillar, peritonsillar, and retropharyngeal abscesses is similar. Systemic antimicrobial therapy should be administered in large doses upon diagnosis; however, when pus is formed, antimicrobial therapy is effective only with adequate surgical drainage. Untreated abscesses may rupture spontaneously into the pharynx, causing catastrophic aspiration. Other complications include the extension of infection laterally to the side of the neck or dissection into the posterior mediastinum through fascial planes and the prevertebral space. Death may occur from aspiration, airway obstruction, erosion into major blood vessels, or extension to the mediastinum.

### MRI of acute neck infections: Evidence summary and pictorial review [^113Lfefc]. Insights into Imaging (2023).

Imaging is necessary when PTAs are clinically suspected of rupturing into adjacent parapharyngeal and retropharyngeal spaces. This deep extension is a severe complication in which the infection breaches the muscles and fascia that define the mucosal space. Once in the parapharyngeal space, an infection can spread more caudally into the submandibular space or laterally into the carotid space. Retropharyngeal abscesses may reach the mediastinum. Deeply extending disease can also lead to necrotizing fasciitis, a rapidly progressing and life-threatening soft tissue infection.

The clinical implication of differentiating between simple PTA and deeply extending disease is significant, as the latter usually requires surgical intervention in the operating room. In PTAs, purulent fluid often exhibits a mixed intermediate signal intensity on T2-weighted images, making it challenging to differentiate from adjacent edematous tissue. Similarly, low ADC in purulent fluid resembles that of neighboring high-cellularity lymphoid tissue in the tonsil. Consequently, post-gadolinium T1-weighted images are likely needed to accurately define pharyngotonsillar abscesses, although the degree of improvement in diagnostic accuracy following the use of an intravenous contrast agent remains unknown.

Muscles and fascia between the mucosal space and parapharyngeal space are not always reliably discerned due to surrounding edema. Therefore, differentiating between PTA and deeply extending abscesses is not easy. By definition, deep abscesses may extend more caudally, beyond the inferior aspect of the periton.

### Needle aspiration versus incision and drainage for the treatment of peritonsillar abscess [^113xyjrB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

Peritonsillar abscess is a common infection presenting as a collection of pus in the peritonsillar area. The condition is characterized by a severe sore throat, difficulty in swallowing and pain on swallowing, fever and malaise, and trismus. Needle aspiration and incision and drainage are the two main treatment modalities currently used. The effectiveness of one versus the other has not been clearly demonstrated and remains an area of debate.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and risks of needle aspiration versus incision and drainage for the treatment of peritonsillar abscess in older children (eight years of age or older), adolescents, and adults.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 7); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 25 August 2016.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials comparing needle aspiration with incision and drainage.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were recurrence rate (proportion of patients needing repeat intervention) and adverse effects associated with the intervention. Secondary outcomes were time to resumption of normal diet, complications of the disease process, and symptom scores. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome.

### Retropharyngeal abscess: Epiglottitis of the new millennium [^114D2awn]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

From 1993 through 1999, 26 children with retropharyngeal abscess and 2 children with acute epiglottitis were cared for by pediatric otolaryngologists in northern Virginia. Fever, sore throat, dysphagia, refusal to swallow, dysphonia, drooling, and neck extension are common presenting signs and symptoms in acute epiglottitis and retropharyngeal abscess. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the oropharynx was performed in all cases and was the most helpful diagnostic test.

### An evidence-based review of the treatment of peritonsillar abscess [^111Hn52Y]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Peritonsillar abscess (PTA) is a commonly seen condition, but remains controversial. An evidence-based review was conducted to address three primary questions: Are steroids beneficial? Which technique is optimal for acute surgical management? When is tonsillectomy appropriate?

A MEDLINE search was undertaken to identify relevant literature using specific search terms. This resulted in the identification of pertinent articles, which were reviewed and graded according to evidence quality.

Forty-two articles were analyzed. No published studies were found regarding the use of steroids in PTA. Five level I clinical studies on surgical techniques suggested that needle aspiration, incision and drainage, and quinsy tonsillectomy are all effective initial management strategies. The overall PTA recurrence rate ranges from 10% to 15%.

In conclusion, grade C evidence suggests that several initial surgical drainage methods are equally effective, with a low recurrence rate. The literature does not specifically discuss different treatments for children and adults.

### Computed tomographic and clinical findings predictive of successful peritonsillar abscess drainage [^114nyk2c]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Low credibility.

Prompt diagnosis of a peritonsillar abscess (PTA) is critical to prevent complications such as airway compromise. Bedside drainage and medical therapy are the mainstays of treatment, but there is a lack of research into clinical and radiographic markers predictive of successful PTA drainage. In this study, we sought to identify those factors.

We retrospectively analyzed all patients who presented to our emergency department from January 2013 to December 2023 with PTA, for whom a CT neck was obtained. Patient demographics, medical history, radiographic imaging, procedures performed, and clinical course were collected. A multivariable analysis was conducted to determine which factors were predictive of successful PTA drainage.

One hundred thirty-two patients met the inclusion criteria; 72 were males. The mean age was 41 years. Patients who had successful PTA drainage had larger abscesses with the largest cross-sectional dimension of 26.38 mm compared to 20.02 mm (p < 0.001). They were also more likely to have soft palate effacement (53.7% vs. 34.0%, p = 0.028) and continuous ring enhancement on CT (75.0% vs. 50.9%, p = 0.003), whereas patients with unsuccessful drainage were more likely to have a higher temperature (99.40°F vs. 98.67°F, p = 0.003).

Clinical and CT parameters were useful in predicting successful PTA drainage. Soft palate effacement, continuous ring enhancement, and size of the abscess were statistically significant predictors and can be used to guide management.

### Association of air pollution with increased risk of peritonsillar abscess formation [^113Aystu]. JAMA Otolaryngology–Head & Neck Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Several studies reported an association between peritonsillar abscess formation and climate conditions, including seasonal changes; however, the results were inconsistent. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between meteorological conditions and/or air pollution and peritonsillar abscess formation.

In this nested case-control study, 3,819 participants with peritonsillar abscesses were matched (1:4) for age, sex, income, region of residence, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia with 15,276 control participants. The Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service-National Sample Cohort (HIRA-NSC) data from 2002 through 2013 were used.

The meteorological data included:

- **Temperature measurements**: Mean daily temperature (°C), highest daily temperature (°C), lowest daily temperature (°C), daily temperature difference (°C)
- **Other meteorological factors**: Relative humidity (%), spot atmospheric pressure (hPa)
- **Air pollution measurements**: Sulfur dioxide ([SO2], parts per million [ppm]), nitrogen dioxide (NO2, ppm), ozone (O3, ppm), carbon monoxide (CO, ppm), particulate matter less than 10 μg (PM10, μg/m3)

These factors were measured for the previous 14 days, 10 days, 7 days, 5 days, or 3 days before the matched index date in 94 or 273 locations hourly. The crude and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of meteorological data for peritonsillar abscess formation were analyzed using unconditional logistic regression analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to age and sex.

The male-to-female ratio of study participants was examined to understand the demographics of the sample.

### Safety of reduced antibiotic prescribing for self limiting respiratory tract infections in primary care: Cohort study using electronic health records [^117XvmsF]. BMJ (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to determine whether the incidence of pneumonia, peritonsillar abscess, mastoiditis, empyema, meningitis, intracranial abscess, and Lemierre's syndrome is higher in general practices that prescribe fewer antibiotics for self limiting respiratory tract infections (RTIs).

- **Design**: Cohort study.

- **Setting**: The study included 610 UK general practices from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink.

- **Participants**: Registered patients with 45.5 million person years of follow-up from 2005 to 2014.

- **Exposures**: The exposures measured were the standardized proportion of RTI consultations with antibiotics prescribed for each general practice, and the rate of antibiotic prescriptions for RTIs per 1000 registered patients.

- **Main outcome measures**: The study focused on the incidence of pneumonia, peritonsillar abscess, mastoiditis, empyema, meningitis, intracranial abscess, and Lemierre's syndrome, adjusting for age group, sex, region, deprivation fifth, RTI consultation rate, and general practice.

Results indicated that from 2005 to 2014 the proportion of RTI consultations with antibiotics prescribed decreased from 53.9% to 50.5% in men and from 54.5% to 51.5% in women. New episodes of meningitis, mastoiditis, and peritonsillar abscess decreased annually by 5.3%, 4.6%, and 1.0%, respectively, whereas new episodes of pneumonia increased by 0.4%. Age and sex standardised incidences for pneumonia and peritonsillar abscess were higher for practices in the lowest fourth of antibiotic prescribing compared with the highest fourth. The adjusted relative risk increases for a 10% reduction in antibiotic prescribing were 12.8% (95% confidence interval 7.8% to 17.5%, P).

### Assessment and causes of stridor [^116XhcMZ]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2016). High credibility.

Among other possible causes, stridor can be caused by:

- **Infections and inflammation**: Peritonsillar abscess, bacterial tracheitis, acute epiglottitis, diphtheria, retropharyngeal abscess, laryngitis

- **Structural abnormalities**: Subglottic hemangioma, laryngomalacia, bronchogenic cyst, laryngeal stenosis, tracheomalacia, goiter

- **Neurological and functional conditions**: Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, bulbar palsy, vocal cord paralysis, vocal cord dysfunction

- **External compression and mass effects**: Riedel's thyroiditis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, superior vena cava syndrome, laryngeal papillomatosis, laryngeal cancer

- **Other respiratory and allergic causes**: Post-extubation stridor, tracheal stenosis, smoke inhalation, foreign body aspiration, angioedema, anaphylaxis, croup, laryngeal edema

In addition, stridor can be caused by medications such as:

- **Medications**: Budesonide, ondansetron, ofloxacin, pyrantel, ondansetron hydrochloride, acetaminophen

### Comparison of medical versus surgical management of peritonsillar abscess: A retrospective observational study [^111NWu5Q]. The Laryngoscope (2016). Low credibility.

To compare clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients presenting with peritonsillar abscess (PTA) treated with either initial medical or surgical management, a retrospective observational cohort study was conducted. A consecutive cohort of patients presenting between 2010 and 2014 with the final diagnosis of PTA (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code 475) were included. Comparisons between groups were evaluated using two-sample t-tests, Wilcoxon rank sum, χ², and Fisher exact tests.

Among 297 patients who presented with PTA during the 5-year period, 97 (33%) underwent primary medical management, and 200 (67%) received surgical treatment. Patients who received initial surgical management had larger abscess sizes (2.6 vs. 1.3 cm, P < .001) and were more likely to have muffled voice (79% vs. 47%, P < .001), drooling (29% vs. 17%, P = 0.03), peritonsillar bulge (91% vs. 66%, P < .001), trismus (65% vs. 22%, P < .001), and dysphagia (86% vs. 73%, P = 0.008). There was no difference in the rates of imaging (55% vs. 59%), antibiotic administration (100% in both groups), length of hospital stay (median 2 vs. 1 day, P = 0.27), or complications (1% vs. 2%, P = 0.6). Patients treated medically were more likely to be admitted to the hospital (22% vs. 11%, P = 0.014) and less likely to receive steroids (78% vs. 95%, P < .001). There was no difference in return visits (20% medical vs. 14% surgical, P = 0.17) or failure rates (5% medical vs. 3% surgical, P = 0.30).

Initial medical management can be considered in patients with peritonsillar abscess, as there are comparable outcomes between medical and surgical management in specific cases.

### National trends in retropharyngeal abscess among adult inpatients with peritonsillar abscess [^1112HiCE]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

To describe national trends in retropharyngeal abscess (RPA) complicating peritonsillar abscess (PTA) and to determine factors associated with RPA in patients with PTA, a cross-sectional analysis was conducted using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 2003 to 2010.

PTA patients aged 18 years or older, with or without RPA, were extracted according to ICD-9-CM codes. The cohort was analyzed using descriptive statistics and multivariate regression modeling to identify factors associated with RPA.

Of the 91,647 (95% CI: 86,433–95,449) patients identified with PTA, 885 (1.0%) also had a concurrently coded RPA. The annual rate of concomitant RPA increased from 0.5% (95% CI: 0.3%-0.8%) to 1.4% (95% CI: 1.0%-2.0%) between 2003 and 2010 (P < .001). PTA patients with RPA more frequently underwent tonsillectomy (23.5% vs. 11.1%), endotracheal intubation (7.1% vs. 1.5%), and mechanical ventilation (13.2% vs. 2.0%) than those without RPA (all P < .001). PTA patients with RPA were significantly older (41 vs. 34 years old), had a longer hospital stay (6.4 vs. 2.5 days), and had more procedures (2.5 vs. 0.9) when compared to patients without RPA (all P < .001).

Upon multivariate regression analysis, factors associated with RPA included the age groups of 40 to 64 years (odds ratio: 2.256, P < .001) and 65 and older (odds ratio: 2.086, P = 0.045). Median total charges for PTA inpatients with concomitant RPA were approximately $8,700 greater (P < .001) when compared to patients with PTA alone.

The incidence of RPA among adult inpatients with PTA is increasing.

### Magnetic resonance imaging findings in pediatric neck infections-a comparison with adult patients [^112NUAnU]. Pediatric radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Some of the false-positive abscesses in children highlight the need to understand how the proportional anatomical, as well as functional differences between children and adults, result in different pathologies. Differentiation between actual suppurative lymphadenitis (intranodal abscess formation) and lymphadenitis may be difficult even with MRI (Fig. 6). Suppurative lymphadenitis is much less common among adults than children. The proportional distribution of lymph nodes is different in children, and in the retropharyngeal space particularly, lymph nodes are frequently affected, although true retropharyngeal abscesses are apparently quite rare. According to our earlier observations, when the retropharyngeal space is affected in adults, it is most likely due to the spreading of infection from other deep spaces of the neck, usually from the peritonsillar and parapharyngeal spaces.

Children had significantly lower CRP than adults, despite having similar rates of abscess formation. This highlights the significance of imaging and suggests that low CRP does not exclude an abscess in children. The specific risks related to MRI use include an excessive rise in patient body temperature (especially relevant for patients with high fever) and potential harm related to unknown magnetizing foreign body objects. These risks can be controlled with careful patient selection and preparation. Body temperature was not routinely measured during or immediately after MRI, but all the scans remained at the recommended specific energy absorption rate limits. The majority of the children receive…

### Retropharyngeal abscess-like as an atypical presentation of Kawasaki disease: a case report and literature review [^111sgmKn]. Pediatric rheumatology online journal (2023). Low credibility.

More than 50% of Kawasaki disease (KD) patients have atypical presentations that may result in delayed or missed diagnosis and, consequently, high rates of vascular damage. We present in this paper a case of KD that presented with a retropharyngeal abscess-like lesion, which is a rare presentation.

Previous literature has shown that 90% of KD patients present with variable head and neck manifestations such as facial exanthema, conjunctivitis, oral mucosal changes, and pharyngitis. Less common presentations include otitis media, torticollis, deep neck infection-like symptoms, meningismus, and acute tonsillitis.

Lymphadenopathy as a KD criterion is the least common diagnostic feature (50–75%), as the incidence of the other criteria occurs in 80–90% of the cases. Lymphadenopathy is described as the initial presenting symptom in 12% of cases. Deep neck infection-like presentation is described in less than 5% of all the patients with head and neck manifestations. Signs and symptoms of retropharyngeal involvement, such as stridor, neck pain, and dysphagia, are less common in KD than in retropharyngeal abscesses.

Peritonsillar, retropharyngeal, and parapharyngeal swelling are uncommonly reported as initial manifestations of KD. The precise pathophysiology of the association of KD with retroparapharyngeal pathology is unclear, with inflammation and edema hypothesized as the main mechanisms.

Tashiro et al. described the typical ultrasound appearance of lymphadenopathy in KD patients as multiple hypoechoic–enlarged nodes forming a palpable mass resembling a cluster of grapes.

### Acute retropharyngeal and parapharyngeal abscesses: A case series [^114ACR2g]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2023). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnosis circumstances, predisposing factors, investigations, and therapeutic management of retropharyngeal and parapharyngeal abscesses.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with retropharyngeal or parapharyngeal abscess from 2001 to 2021 was performed. Epidemiological characteristics, clinical signs, investigations, medical treatment, and surgical interventions were analyzed for each patient.

- **Results**: A total of 30 patients with retropharyngeal or parapharyngeal abscess were identified. Computed tomography was performed in all cases, and magnetic resonance imaging was performed in three cases. Twelve patients had a "pure" retropharyngeal abscess, nine patients had a prestyloid abscess, one patient had a prestyloid abscess associated with a peritonsillar abscess, three patients had a retrostyloid abscess, and five patients had a prestyloid abscess associated with a retropharyngeal abscess or a retrostyloid abscess. The median long axis of the abscess was 42 cm. All patients received intravenous antibiotics for a median period of 8 days [4–30]. Seventeen patients required surgical trans-cervical drainage. Other patients underwent transoral or transnasal drainage. The pus culture revealed no growth in six cases, streptococcus (four cases), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (two cases), Klebsiella (two cases), Enterobacter (one case), Fungi (two cases), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (a twelve-year-old boy). It was not documented in twelve cases.

### Peritonsillar abscess: Complication of acute tonsillitis or Weber's glands infection [^115rm58v]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

To review the literature concerning the two primary hypotheses put forth to explain the pathogenesis of peritonsillar abscess: "the acute tonsillitis hypothesis" (peritonsillar abscess is a complication of acute tonsillitis) and "the Weber gland hypothesis" (peritonsillar abscess is an infection of Weber's glands).

- **Data sources**: PubMed, EMBASE.

- **Review methods**: Data supporting or negating one hypothesis or the other were elicited from the literature.

- **Conclusions**: Several findings support the acute tonsillitis hypothesis. First, the two main pathogens in peritonsillar abscess have been recovered from pus aspirates and bilateral tonsillar tissues with high concordance rates, suggesting that both tonsils are infected in patients with peritonsillar abscess. Second, studies report signs of acute tonsillitis in the days prior to and at the time of peritonsillar abscess. Third, antibiotic treatment reduces the risk of abscess development in patients with acute tonsillitis. However, some findings suggest involvement of the Weber's glands in peritonsillar abscess pathogenesis. First, high amylase levels have been found in peritonsillar pus. Second, the majority of peritonsillar abscesses are located at the superior tonsillar pole in proximity to the Weber's glands. We propose a unified hypothesis whereby bacteria initially infect the tonsillar mucosa and spread via the salivary duct system to the peritonsillar space, where an abscess is formed.

- **Implications for practice**: Our findings support the rationale for antibiotic treatment of patients with severe acute tonsillitis.

### Clinical features of Kawasaki disease initially mimicking retropharyngeal abscess: A retrospective analysis [^112SSYeb]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Cases of Kawasaki disease (KD) initially presenting as retropharyngeal abnormality are reported in Table 2. All patients initially presented with fever and neck swelling without the additional clinical criteria for the diagnosis of classic KD. The initial clinical presentation was concerning for possible deep neck bacterial infection, prompting us to order imaging studies and initiate antibiotic therapy. They had a delayed diagnosis because their conditions were misdiagnosed as retropharyngeal abscess and they underwent antibiotic, corticosteroids, or surgical drainage treatment in the early phase of the disease. They all had a persistent fever unresponsive to antibiotics.

Antibiotic therapy was escalated to suit the conditions of 3 patients. Surgical drainage was performed on 1 child, but no purulent discharge was obtained after incision, and no microorganisms were cultured. The rash of 4 patients, when it appeared secondarily, was mistaken for an allergic reaction to antibiotics. An accurate diagnosis was made in these cases when fever persisted and other characteristic features of KD eventually developed. The mean time between the onset of illness and KD diagnosis was 6.80 days. After establishing the diagnosis, all patients received high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and aspirin treatment followed by rapid clinical improvement.

Such delays in diagnosis and appropriate treatment led to 2 patients (20.00%) demonstrating abnormal findings on echocardiography (coronary artery dilatation) during the acute illness. All patients were discharged with partial or complete recovery.

### Observation of retropharyngeal fluid collection in 2 COVID-19 positive patients [^1179tHGB]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, is growing; yet, much remains unknown, and unique presentations are abundant. One potential presentation is retropharyngeal edema, defined as fluid in the retropharyngeal space. Multiplanar imaging with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is ideal for characterizing and diagnosing these fluid collections rapidly, as possible life-threatening complications may develop, such as airway obstruction and mediastinitis. We discuss the presentation, imaging identification, treatment, and recovery of retropharyngeal fluid collection in two COVID-19 cases. The significance of this article is to suggest conservative management as a viable treatment option for retropharyngeal fluid collection, as opposed to incision and drainage, in the setting of COVID-19.

### Bilateral peritonsillar abscess revisited [^1123pePp]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Bilateral peritonsillar abscess is uncommon. When it does occur, patients usually present with a sore throat; other clinical signs and symptoms may differ from those usually associated with unilateral peritonsillar abscess. We describe two cases of bilateral peritonsillar abscess that were successfully treated with needle aspiration of both sides using a 14-gauge intravenous cannula. Needle aspiration is an accepted form of treatment for unilateral peritonsillar abscess, but to the best of our knowledge, its use as a sole treatment modality (with observation under intravenous antibiotic coverage) for bilateral peritonsillar abscess has not been previously reported in the literature. We also believe that the incidence of acute bilateral peritonsillar abscess may be higher than the rates that have been reported in the literature. Finally, we recommend that the threshold for imaging be low for any patient who is suspected of having acute bilateral peritonsillar abscess to avoid any delay in diagnosis and treatment.

### Peritonsillar abscess due to temporomandibular joint septic arthritis: an uncommon cause of a common disease [^112fyfrH]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Peritonsillar abscess is a common presentation of complicated acute tonsillitis. Temporomandibular joint septic arthritis is an uncommon clinical entity, and its complications are even rarer. We present a case of a man in his late 30s who presented with a painful swelling in the left preauricular region along with increasing trismus. A diagnosis of peritonsillar abscess due to septic arthritis was made based on clinical history and examination. The patient recovered fully after antibiotic treatment and abscess drainage. This is the first case report of temporomandibular septic arthritis leading to peritonsillar abscess.

### Retropharyngeal abscess-like as an atypical presentation of Kawasaki disease: A case report and literature review [^113J19cE]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). High credibility.

Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute, self-limiting vasculitis of childhood, typically presenting before the age of five years, with a peak age incidence between 6 months and 2 years. The vasculitis predominantly affects medium-sized arteries, with a striking predilection for the coronary arteries, leading to coronary artery aneurysms (CAAs) in 15–25% of untreated cases, thus causing the most important life-threatening complication of KD. KD is the major cause of acquired heart disease in the developed world, with consequences including myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, and sudden death.

Due to the non-specific symptoms and a lack of specific confirmatory laboratory tests, the diagnosis is based on clinical criteria. This is often challenging as only 40% of KD patients present with conclusive clinical criteria, with the remainder presenting with incomplete or atypical symptoms.

The incidence of CAA decreases to < 5% after timely treatment with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (2 g/kg/day) therapy, which is most effective if commenced within the first ten days of signs. Awareness of unusual clinical KD manifestations is important, as it may raise the index of suspicion and expedite treatment.

In this article, we describe a patient who presented with an atypical retropharyngeal abscess-like lesion, unresponsive to several antibiotics regimens and surgical drainage, but who promptly responded to immunoglobulin treatment once a diagnosis of KD was suspected. Additionally, we present a literature review of similar cases spanning recent years.

### Clinical features of Kawasaki disease initially mimicking retropharyngeal abscess: A retrospective analysis [^113PX6Ho]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Although no sex difference was observed in children with incomplete Kawasaki disease (IKD) initially presenting as retropharyngeal abnormality, patients with retropharyngeal low-density lesions were older than those without. This suggests that the more mature mucosal immune system in older patients might result in a more intense inflammatory response.

In the early phase of the clinical course, symptoms of IKD initially presenting as a retropharyngeal abnormality include fever, sore throat, neck pain, torticollis or limitation of motion, neck irritation, and lymphadenopathy. Some patients experienced dysphagia, dyspnoea, salivation, and hoarseness. Severe cases can lead to wheezing and upper airway obstruction.

Distinguishing children with IKD initially presenting as retropharyngeal abnormality from those with retropharyngeal abscess in the early phase is challenging. On the day of admission, the two diseases had similar early clinical presentations, with no significant differences in major signs or symptoms between the two groups. The rate of hoarseness in group A, group B, and group C was 20.00%, 15.00%, and 12.50%, respectively. However, there was no significant difference between groups, likely due to the small sample size.

Previous studies revealed that hoarseness is a prevalent presenting sign of acute Kawasaki disease (KD) in younger children, possibly related to viral infection and immunological diseases, occurring in 11.6–30.0% of patients. In contrast, in children with retropharyngeal abscess, hoarseness often results from compression.

### Chronic retropharyngeal abscess presenting as obstructive sleep apnea [^117SNq3o]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic retropharyngeal abscess (RPA) in children is an unusual condition that has rarely been reported in the literature. Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has many etiologies that have been well described, but there have been no reports of a chronic RPA presenting with severe OSA.

We describe an infant who presented with severe OSA due to oropharyngeal narrowing by a chronic abscess. An intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging study confirmed the presence of an RPA. Treatment included tracheostomy, surgical drainage, and intravenous followed by oral antibiotics. Physicians evaluating children with recent onset severe OSA following a respiratory infection should include suppurative oropharyngeal pathology in the differential diagnosis. A recent drainage of a head or neck abscess should strengthen that suspicion.

### Retropharyngeal and parapharyngeal abscesses among children and adolescents in the United States: Epidemiology and management trends, 2003–2012 [^111ztnzF]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2016). Low credibility.

The epidemiology and hospital course of children with retropharyngeal abscess (RPA) or parapharyngeal abscess (PPA) have not been fully described at the national level in the United States.

- **Methods**: Pediatric discharges for PPA and RPA were evaluated using the Kids' Inpatient Database from 2003, 2006, 2009, and 2012. Cases were identified using International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes 478.22 and 478.24 for PPA and RPA, respectively. Nationally representative incidence data were calculated using weighted case estimates and US census data. Demographic and cost analyses were conducted using unweighted analyses.

- **Results**: There were 2,685 hospital discharges for PPA and 6,233 hospital discharges for RPA during the four study years combined. The incidence of RPA increased from 2.98 per 100,000 population among children under 20 years old in 2003 to 4.10 per 100,000 in 2012. The incidence of PPA peaked at 1.49 per 100,000 in 2006. Incidences were highest among children under 5 years old and boys in all age groups for both PPA and RPA. Winter-to-spring seasonality was also evident for both. PPA was managed surgically in 58.1% of cases, and RPA was managed surgically in 46.7%. Surgery was performed most often on the day of admission or the following day, was more frequent at teaching hospitals, and was associated with higher hospital charges. The mean hospital length of stay was longer for children who had surgery versus those who did not (4.4 vs 3.1 days for PPA and 4.8 vs 3.2 days for RPA, respectively; both P < .001).

### Bilateral peritonsillar abscess: Case report and literature review [^117SkuSa]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2011). Low credibility.

Although uncommon, bilateral peritonsillar abscess (PTA) may still present with symptoms found in unilateral cases but lack hallmark findings such as an asymmetric tonsillar bulge and uvular deviation. We present the case of an 18-year-old woman deemed to have a bilateral PTA based on physical examination and radiographic imaging. She underwent successful surgical drainage with needle aspiration, followed by incision and drainage. A computed tomography with intravenous contrast should be obtained when a patient displays signs suggestive of a bilateral PTA but the diagnosis is not certain. To our knowledge, this is the first report of two different bacterial species cultured from contralateral abscesses during the same encounter.

### Retropharyngeal abscess presenting with sleep apnea syndrome [^116hn24L]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Retropharyngeal abscess (RPA) is the second most common deep neck space infection after peritonsillar abscess in the pediatric population. Major signs and symptoms on physical examination include fever, hypersalivation, odynophagia, reduced oral intake, sore throat, neck swelling, torticollis, limitation in neck mobility, and voice changes. In this paper, the authors present a case of RPA with unusual and interesting presenting symptoms in a 10-month-old infant exhibiting new-onset and worsening snoring and sleep apnea. The purposes of this manuscript are to present the authors' experience with this patient, emphasize the diagnosis, clinical course, and management of RPA in infants, and signify the importance of including RPA in the differential diagnosis of patients with sleep apnea syndrome.

### Association between computed tomographic scan and timing and treatment of peritonsillar abscess in children [^1117BEp3]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

There is not a consensus on the best diagnostic algorithm for children with a potential peritonsillar abscess. The association of computed tomographic (CT) scanning in children with a peritonsillar abscess and the intervention chosen by the treating physician, or the potential delay of treatment associated with such imaging, has not yet been explored.

To determine if the use of a CT scan is associated with a difference in clinical intervention for peritonsillar abscess and to determine if use of a CT scan is associated with a delay of this intervention, a retrospective case-control study was conducted. The study examined therapeutic interventions based on the presence or absence of a diagnostic CT scan in children diagnosed with peritonsillar abscess from November 1, 2006, to November 1, 2015. Children who presented either to the emergency department or to their pediatrician with a peritonsillar abscess were divided into two groups: those diagnosed without the use of a CT scan (controls; n = 38) and those diagnosed with the use of a CT scan (cases; n = 30).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Patients were examined for two outcomes: admission or no admission. The groups were also examined for the type of intervention performed: bedside procedure (needle aspiration or incision and drainage), surgical procedure in the operating room (needle aspiration, incision and drainage, or tonsillectomy), no procedure, or both bedside and surgical procedure. In addition, the time to an otolaryngology consultation and to each of the above interventions was calculated.

### Retropharyngeal abscess in a post-lung transplant cystic fibrosis patient with prior cervical fusion: a case study [^115mcPkX]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), especially those post-lung transplant, are at an increased risk for upper airway disorders such as chronic sinusitis and nasal polyps due to the inherent mucociliary clearance disturbance caused by CF pathophysiology and long-term use of anti-rejection medications. This increased risk of upper airway disorders may predispose healthcare providers to misdiagnose a patient with CF, with more common disorders such as sinusitis or nasal polyps, which may make a retropharyngeal abscess (RPA) more difficult to diagnose. The relative infrequency of RPA may also predispose healthcare providers to exclude RPA in the differential diagnosis for patients with CF presenting with upper airway symptoms.

Additionally, patients with CF are accustomed to frequent sinusitis and nasal polyps, decreasing the likelihood that they will report infection concerns to healthcare providers in a timely manner. The combination of anti-rejection medication from bilateral lung transplantation and hardware from prior cervical fusion compound the risk of developing an infection such as RPA in this patient. Prompt diagnosis of RPA is critical due to the potential for airway compression and respiratory arrest caused by the space-occupying abscess. Traditionally, a CT scan with contrast is the optimal imaging modality for an isolated RPA. MRI was used in addition to CT for this patient due to their history of spine surgery and neurologic sequelae on presentation. Prompt otolaryngology evaluation with awake flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy is also important to assess airway patency. An RPA, if not treated early, can lead to severe complications.

### Clinical features of Kawasaki disease initially mimicking retropharyngeal abscess: A retrospective analysis [^117DXhtm]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Low credibility.

The characteristics of Group A and Group C are summarized in Table 1. No statistically significant differences were found in demographic data or most clinical manifestations between the two groups, including sex, age, and major clinical symptoms and signs. The patients in both groups mainly presented with fever, neck pain, and restricted neck movements on admission. The rate of hoarseness in Group A and Group C was 20.00% and 12.50%, respectively. However, there was no significant group difference, which was probably related to the small sample size.

The fever duration was not significantly different between the two groups. However, there was a significantly shorter fever duration before antibiotic therapy (2.50 (1.37–3.63) vs. 4.19 (1.47–6.91), p = 0.005) and longer fever duration after antibiotic therapy (4.50 (3.42–5.58) vs. 1.31 (0.57–2.06), p = 0.000) in the KD children initially presenting with retropharyngeal abnormalities. When compared with retropharyngeal abscesses, significantly more children in the KD group experienced fever lasting ≥ 3 days after antibiotic therapy (9 (90.00%) vs. 3 (18.75%), p = 0.001).

### Retropharyngeal abscess and mediastinitis in a well-appearing infant with prolonged fever [^114ttopM]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

Fever is a common presenting chief complaint in the pediatric emergency department. We report the case of a well-appearing 11-month-old female with 2 weeks of daily fevers who was found to have an extensive retropharyngeal abscess with mediastinal and extrapleural extension. We review the literature on retropharyngeal abscesses and mediastinitis in children and note that this patient is unusual, as she presented with such extensive disease with minimal symptoms. This case demonstrates the importance of a thorough history and broad differential diagnosis when evaluating children presenting with prolonged fevers.

### Emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and readmissions of patients with a peritonsillar abscess [^112QmHFN]. The Laryngoscope (2017). Low credibility.

To determine the demographics and treatment outcomes of patients with a peritonsillar abscess (PTA) and to provide guidance for treatment options, the 2012 National Emergency Department Database, 2012 National Inpatient Sample, and 2013 Nationwide Readmissions Database were used. These databases analyzed patients with a PTA who presented to emergency departments (ED), were admitted, and/or readmitted to hospitals in the United States. Outcomes were used to create a decision model to compare initial medical versus surgical management.

An estimated 62,787 ED visits, 15,095 inpatient admissions, and 267 readmissions for PTA were recorded. The average age was 29 years, with a slight male predominance. The majority of patients seen in the ED (80%) were treated without surgery and discharged home, whereas patients admitted to the hospital were more likely to undergo surgery (50%). The tonsillectomy rate was 11%, and the complication and readmission rates were less than 2%. Medical therapy was used more often than surgical therapy in many cases.

Peritonsillar abscess mostly occurs in adults and leads to a significant number of ED visits, admissions, and readmissions. A trial of medical management of PTA appears to be safe, although surgery is highly successful and associated with low morbidity.

### An outpatient medical treatment protocol for peritonsillar abscess [^111vbxJo]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Several surgical methods are used to treat peritonsillar abscess, but no protocol for outpatient medical treatment has yet been published. Between February 2002 and February 2005, we treated 98 peritonsillar abscess patients with an outpatient medical regimen involving hydration, antibiotics, steroids, and effective pain control. All patients were Native Americans, who are known to have a particularly high incidence of peritonsillar abscess. The medical regimen was generally successful, as only 4 patients (4.1%) subsequently required post-treatment needle aspiration or incision and drainage. We conclude that the medical protocol described herein provides practitioners with a viable noninvasive alternative for treating peritonsillar abscess.

### Clinical features of Kawasaki disease initially mimicking retropharyngeal abscess: A retrospective analysis [^115MeovQ]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Low credibility.

In laboratory findings, Kawasaki disease (KD) initially presenting as a retropharyngeal abnormality showed lower white blood cell (WBC) counts (16.35 [12.13–20.56] vs. 20.81 [17.31–24.31], p = 0.040) and higher C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (94.19 [78.68–109.69] vs. 58.14 [38.33–77.96], p = 0.011) compared to retropharyngeal abscess controls, with statistically significant differences. There were significantly higher levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (91.00 [15.04–166.94] vs. 13.75 [10.07–17.43], p = 0.002) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (65.60 [28.89–102.31] vs. 25.25 [20.50–30.00], p = 0.013) in the KD group.

The total and direct bilirubin levels in group A were higher than in group C. While this may have clinical relevance for patients with incomplete KD (IKD), it was not statistically significant, likely due to small sample sizes. The troponin I level was significantly higher in group A compared to group C; however, it remained below normal, and the difference was not substantial enough to hold clinical relevance. Other laboratory test results, including median levels of platelets, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), sodium (Na), and coagulation function, showed no differences between the two groups.

### Clinical features of Kawasaki disease initially mimicking retropharyngeal abscess: A retrospective analysis [^116bBfTB]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Incomplete Kawasaki disease (IKD) initially presenting as a retropharyngeal abnormality is very rare and prone to misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis, often leading to poor prognosis. Most patients were misdiagnosed with retropharyngeal abscesses. Here, we describe and compare IKD patients initially presenting with retropharyngeal abnormalities, typical KD patients without retropharyngeal abnormalities, and retropharyngeal abscess patients.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective case–control study comparing IKD patients initially presenting with retropharyngeal abnormalities to both KD patients without retropharyngeal abnormalities and retropharyngeal abscess patients admitted to Shenzhen Children's Hospital between January 2016 and December 2021.

- **Results**: We evaluated data from 10 IKD patients initially presenting with retropharyngeal abnormalities (Group A), 20 typical KD patients (Group B), and 16 surgical drainage-confirmed retropharyngeal abscess patients (Group C). Compared to Group B, we observed that Group A was older and had a more intense inflammatory response. On the day of admission, Groups A and C had similar early clinical presentations, and there were no significant differences in any major signs or symptoms. Close observation for the development of new KD signs and symptoms and unresponsiveness to empirical antibiotic therapy after 3 days is extremely important. The CRP (p = 0.011), AST (p = 0.002), and ALT (p = 0.013) levels were significantly higher, and the WBC (p = 0.040) levels were significantly lower in Group A than in Group C.

### The surgical treatment of peritonsillar abscess: A retrospective analysis in 584 patients [^116Ph3cd]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Low credibility.

There are three surgical treatment options for patients with peritonsillar abscess (PTA): needle aspiration, incision and drainage (ID), and abscess tonsillectomy (ATE). The updated German national guideline (2015) included changes in the treatment of PTA. The indication for tonsillectomy (TE) in patients became more stringent, and preference was given to ID in certain cases.

- **Study design**: Retrospective analysis.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective systematic analysis of patient data using the in-house electronic patient records and considered a 4-year period from 2014 to 2017. About 584 patients were identified. Our aim was to analyze the influence of the updated guideline on clinical practice.

- **Results**:
	- 236 of 584 patients (40.4%) underwent ATE with contralateral TE.
	- In 225 patients (38.5%), unilateral ATE was performed.
	- Mean surgery time was significantly shortened when only unilateral ATE was performed.
	- Concerning postoperative bleeding, we noted a tendency toward a lower incidence after ATE in comparison to ATE with contralateral TE.
	- Less than 1% of patients who underwent ATE had to be revised surgically due to postoperative hemorrhage.
	- After the revision of the guideline, unilateral ATE and ID were conducted more frequently.

- **Conclusion**: These results support that ATE in an inpatient setting is a considerably safe and effective primary therapeutic option. ID represents a favorable treatment option for patients with PTA and comorbidities; nevertheless, patient compliance is required, and insufficient drainage or recurrence of PTA may occur.

### Brain abscess from a peritonsillar abscess in an immunocompetent child: a case report and review of the literature [^115SCzKM]. Pediatric Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

A brain abscess is uncommon but potentially lethal. Common predisposing risk factors include congenital cyanotic heart disease, immunocompromised status, and the presence of septic foci. We describe a left frontal brain abscess accompanied by fever, headache, and weight loss over a 3-month period. The presumptive source of the brain abscess involved a left peritonsillar abscess. To the best of our knowledge, one similar case was reported in the literature in 1929. The specific signs of peritonsillar abscess in our patient included trismus, decreased phonation, and a muffled voice. The peritonsillar abscess was not clinically diagnosed but was incidentally detected on lower axial sections of cranial magnetic resonance imaging. Fever and trismus improved after surgical drainage of the peritonsillar abscess. The cerebral abscess was conservatively treated with intravenous antibiotics. The patient developed hydrocephalus as a sequela to the involvement of the basal meninges.

### Pediatric peritonsillar abscess: Outcomes and cost savings from using transcervical ultrasound [^115Rs4Hx]. The Laryngoscope (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was twofold: First, to analyze the clinical outcomes of children stratified by ultrasound into three diagnoses — acute tonsillitis, peritonsillar phlegmon, and abscess. Second, to compare the clinical outcomes and financial impact between children who underwent the ultrasound protocol and those who did not.

- **Study design**: Retrospective analysis was conducted between two cohorts: an ultrasound protocol group and a control group.

- **Methods**: Children with peritonsillar abscess (PTA) diagnosed in the emergency department (ED) were enrolled during a 2-year period for transcervical ultrasound evaluation of bilateral tonsillar fossae. Data from a cohort of patients with PTA prior to ultrasound screening were also collected from retrospective chart review. Outcome variables were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression.

- **Results**: Seventy-eight children (mean 12.3 years) were enrolled in the ultrasound protocol, compared to 101 children (mean 13.6 years) evaluated using traditional methods of examination and/or computed tomography (CT) imaging. Demographics between the two groups were not significantly different. Only one-third of patients presumed to have PTA by ED staff had ultrasound findings consistent with abscess. The overall treatment failure rate was 8%, requiring readmission or surgical intervention for abscess. Length of stay, surgical drainage, and radiation exposure from CT scans were significantly reduced in the ultrasound group (P < 0.006). Differences in readmission rates and mean charges between the two groups did not reach significance.

- **Conclusion**: Peritonsillar abscess is a common infection in the pediatric population, and the use of transcervical ultrasound offers measurable benefits in reducing treatment failures and minimizing unnecessary interventions.

### Clinical features of Kawasaki disease initially mimicking retropharyngeal abscess: A retrospective analysis [^116KfVHC]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Low credibility.

In addition, the patients could be distinguished by careful in-depth analysis of laboratory parameters and neck radiological findings. Our study shows that AST, ALT, and CRP levels were significantly higher and WBC levels were significantly lower in IKD initially presenting as retropharyngeal abnormalities than in retropharyngeal abscesses. This may be because IKD is a systemic disease and might involve liver injury. ALT and AST are indices of liver function damage. The exact etiology of abnormalities of liver function tests in IKD has not been established. Hypotheses include generalized inflammation, vasculitis, congestive heart failure secondary to myocarditis, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory antipyretics, toxin-mediated effects, or a combination of these events. Since retropharyngeal abscess is more a local infection, this does not appear to affect liver function.

In some previous reports, these laboratory findings also differed slightly between the two diseases, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Furthermore, neck radiological findings, such as the presence of ring enhancement and mass effects on the airway, are also useful tools for distinguishing these two diseases. In all of our IKD children, the main finding was retropharyngeal low density without ring enhancement and mass effects on the airway. Roh et al. reported that the majority, 34 (61%) out of 56 patients with retropharyngeal low density, were diagnosed with KD, and retropharyngeal low density without rim enhancement was seen in all KD patients.

### Clinical features of Kawasaki disease initially mimicking retropharyngeal abscess: a retrospective analysis [^116WebTB]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Low credibility.

All procedures performed in this study involving human participants were in accordance with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. This study employed retrospective medical record reviews of children who were admitted with discharge diagnoses suggestive of Kawasaki disease (KD) or retropharyngeal abscess in Shenzhen Children's Hospital between January 2016 and December 2021.

There were 1,516 children with discharge diagnoses of KD and 123 children with discharge diagnoses of retropharyngeal abscess in the Inpatient Discharge Registry. Ultimately, we included 10 IKD patients initially presenting as retropharyngeal abnormality (group A), 20 KD patients without retropharyngeal abnormality (group B), and 16 surgical drainage confirmed retropharyngeal abscess patients (group C).

In 1,516 KD patients, 10 patients (0.66%) initially presented as retropharyngeal abnormality (group A), and they were suspected of having a retropharyngeal abscess based on their clinical findings. These were accompanied by retropharyngeal low-density areas on CT, leading to their admission or transfer to the pediatric ENT department. They all were finally diagnosed with IKD according to the American Heart Association diagnosis criteria in 2017.

In addition, for each KD case initially presenting as a retropharyngeal abnormality, two control children were randomly selected from the KD without retropharyngeal abnormality group (Group B). Furthermore, 16 patients (13.01%) were confirmed by incision and drainage of the abscess (group C) out of the 123 retropharyngeal abscess patients.

### Clinical features of Kawasaki disease initially mimicking retropharyngeal abscess: a retrospective analysis [^116PQMQL]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Currently, the specific mechanisms of Kawasaki disease (KD)-induced retropharyngeal abnormalities remain unclear. However, the clinical and operative details, as well as the retropharyngeal abnormality of all cases, disappeared following immunoglobulin treatment rather than antibiotic therapy, suggesting that inflammation and oedema were likely the main mechanisms, consistent with previously reported literature. In our reported cases and previous cases, surgical exploration of the retropharyngeal area did not reveal areas of fluctuance or abscess, and cultures of the inflammatory exudate were sterile. Additionally, it is important to note that there are no reported cases of KD with coexisting retropharyngeal abscess.

The retropharyngeal space is anterior to the prevertebral muscles and lies posterior to the pharynx and oesophagus. This space extends from the skull base to the superior mediastinum (the T1-T6 vertebrae). There is loose connective tissue and abundant lymph nodes within the retropharyngeal space. Lymphadenopathy can lead to lymphatic circulation disorders, accumulation of lymph in the posterior pharyngeal wall, formation of hypodense oedematous areas, and imaging findings similar to posterior pharyngeal abscess. This could explain why the retropharyngeal low-attenuation area seen in neck radiological findings is its extension without significant ring enhancement and mass effects on the airway. The inflammatory responses in the mucosal immune system produce excess levels of inflammatory cytokines during the acute phase of KD. Retropharyngeal low-density lesions in IKD might be caused by a similar mechanism.

### Clinical features of Kawasaki disease initially mimicking retropharyngeal abscess: A retrospective analysis [^116jXQfP]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Although IKD initially presenting as a retropharyngeal abnormality is rare, the careful observation of the signs and symptoms of this disease, along with a comprehensive analysis of laboratory tests and neck radiological findings, could lead to early detection. This may reduce unnecessary antibiotic use, avoid invasive procedures such as surgical aspiration, and prevent serious complications. The possibility of KD should be considered in children showing deep neck inflammation unresponsive to empirical antibiotic therapy after three days and low-density cervical lesions demonstrating minimal to no enhancement. When children initially present with retropharyngeal abnormalities, pediatricians, otolaryngologists, and radiologists should be aware of it as an atypical presentation of KD.

### Observation of retropharyngeal fluid collection in 2 COVID-19 positive patients [^116DvBgE]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, is growing; yet, there remains much we do not understand, and unique presentations are abundant. One potential presentation is retropharyngeal edema, defined as fluid in the retropharyngeal space. Multiplanar imaging with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is ideal for characterizing and diagnosing these fluid collections rapidly, as possible life-threatening complications may develop, such as airway obstruction and mediastinitis. Here, we discuss the presentation, imaging identification, treatment, and recovery of retropharyngeal fluid collection in 2 COVID-19 cases.

The significance of this article is to suggest conservative management as a viable treatment option for retropharyngeal fluid collection, as opposed to incision and drainage, in the setting of COVID-19.

### Peritonsillar abscess outcomes with and without computed tomography: A retrospective cohort study [^111JjPxg]. The Laryngoscope (2024). Low credibility.

Peritonsillar abscess (PTA) is a common deep space head and neck infection, which can be diagnosed with or without computed tomography (CT). CT poses a risk for false positives, leading to unnecessary abscess drainage attempts without benefit, whereas needle or open aspiration without imaging could potentially lead to missed abscesses in need of treatment. This study considered the utility and impact of obtaining CT scans in patients with suspected PTA by comparing outcomes between CT and non-CT usage.

- **Methods**: Retrospective cohort analysis using TriNetX datasets compared the outcomes of two cohorts: PTA without CT and PTA with CT. Measured outcomes included incision and drainage; quinsy adenotonsillectomy; recurrent PTA (rePTA); airway emergency/obstruction; repeat emergency department (ED) visits; and need for antibiotics, opiates, or steroids. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated using a cohort analysis.

- **Results**: The CT usage group had increased odds of receiving antibiotics (OR 3.043, [2.043–4.531]), opiates (OR 1.614, [1.138–1.289]), and steroids (OR 1.373, [1.108–1.702]), as well as a higher likelihood of returning to the ED (OR 5.900, [3.534–9.849]) and developing a rePTA (OR 1.943, [1.410–2.677]). No significant differences were observed in the incidence of incision and drainage, quinsy adenotonsillectomy, or airway emergency/obstruction.

- **Conclusion**: Our study indicated that CT scans for PTA diagnosis were associated with increased prescription of antibiotics, opioids, steroids, return ED visits, and rePTA. Future prospective trials are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of CT scans in the management of PTA.

### Retropharyngeal abscess-like as an atypical presentation of Kawasaki disease: a case report and literature review [^11391b3R]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Low credibility.

Kawasaki disease requires a high index of suspicion and awareness of unusual presentations. In our case and literature review, Kawasaki disease mimicked a retropharyngeal abscess that was refractory to antibiotics and surgical intervention. Thus, Kawasaki disease should be kept in mind as one of the differential diagnoses for patients with febrile lymphadenitis and/or retropharyngeal abscess who do not respond to antibiotic treatment in the relevant clinical context. This awareness can prevent delay in diagnosis and detrimental sequelae.

### Giant retropharyngeal abscess in an adult as a complication of acute tonsillitis: case report [^116nHRRN]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2009). Low credibility.

A retropharyngeal abscess is an uncommon condition that can lead to severe and potentially fatal complications if it is not identified and treated promptly. Clinical and radiological evaluations are crucial and must be considered together before proceeding with surgical drainage for a suspected retropharyngeal abscess. In cases where airway obstruction is a concern, emergent surgical management with tracheotomy may be necessary. This report describes a 22-year-old man who developed a massive retropharyngeal abscess due to inadequate treatment of acute tonsillitis. The patient responded well to surgical drainage and empiric antibiotic therapy.

### MRI of acute neck infections: Evidence summary and pictorial review [^111YYvW6]. Insights into Imaging (2023). Low credibility.

Mediastinal extension

Severe infections can spread to the mediastinum, either posteriorly from the retropharyngeal space or anteriorly through visceral and anterior cervical spaces. Subtle reactive edema (ME) should not be mistaken for treatable mediastinal disease. Accurate delineation of mediastinal abscesses is important. Although small mediastinal abscesses may be treated conservatively, widespread abscesses may require surgery following a clinical multidisciplinary evaluation. Extending the imaging field of view from the neck to the mediastinum is straightforward with contrast-enhanced CT but requires more time and effort with MRI because sequences may need to be specifically tailored for the mediastinum. This requires more scanning time and radiologist supervision. In the chest area, susceptibility effects caused by interfaces between soft tissues and air cause artifacts that may degrade diagnostic performance.

- **Mediastinal extension in imaging**: Mediastinal extension of abscesses can be observed on axial T2-weighted and fat-suppressed post-contrast T1-weighted images in infants. Note the somewhat degraded image quality at this level. The patient underwent thoracoscopy 3 days after MRI because the condition worsened during medical management.

Necrotizing fasciitis

Necrotizing fasciitis of the head and neck is a rapidly progressing and life-threatening infection caused by bacteria. The infected tissue becomes necrotic as a process involving vasculitis with microthrombosis and edema of the subcutaneous tissues progresses, leading to severe systemic toxicity in the later stages.

### A novel approach to enhance visualization during drainage of peritonsillar abscess [^114hWFss]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Routine emergency department care for uncomplicated peritonsillar abscess involves needle aspiration or incision and drainage. The standard technique involves the use of a tongue blade and an auxiliary light source. Here, we describe the novel use of a disassembled disposable vaginal speculum with a fiberoptic light, which is becoming commonplace in many emergency departments. This novel approach to managing peritonsillar abscess greatly enhances visualization and facilitates peritonsillar abscess drainage.

### Cannula aspiration of peritonsillar abscesses [^11215GA3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Peritonsillar abscesses may be treated by needle aspiration, incision and drainage, or abscess tonsillectomy. A modification of the technique of needle aspiration is described. This technique minimizes the risk of vascular damage during needle aspiration and is more reassuring to the patient.

### A pilot study on pediatric mononucleosis presenting with abscess [^111jnkjY]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2020). Low credibility.

To describe this new clinical entity, diagnosis, and potential management of pediatric intratonsillar/peritonsillar abscesses in children affected by infectious mononucleosis, we conducted a study.

After institutional review board approval, a retrospective chart review was performed. The review included patients who had undergone testing for infectious mononucleosis as well as a computed tomography scan of the head and neck. Patients who did not have imaging of the palatine tonsils or had insufficient testing for diagnosing infectious mononucleosis were excluded.

- **Main findings**: One hundred patients were included in the study. Fifteen had a peritonsillar abscess and twenty-nine had an intratonsillar abscess. Among the patients with a peritonsillar abscess, four (26.7%) tested positive for Monospot or Epstein-Barr virus IgM, while two (13.3%) had positive rapid strep or culture results. In patients with an intratonsillar abscess, eight (27.6%) tested positive for Monospot or Epstein-Barr virus IgM, and two (6.9%) had a positive rapid strep or culture result. Of those with bilateral intratonsillar abscesses, five of twelve (41.7%) patients showed laboratory markers for infectious mononucleosis, compared to three of seventeen (17.6%) with unilateral intratonsillar abscess. This difference was not statistically significant (Fischer's, p = 0.218).

In conclusion, in this cohort of patients undergoing computed tomography scans and acute infectious mononucleosis testing, intratonsillar and peritonsillar abscess were more commonly associated with positive mononucleosis markers than with streptococcus markers.

### Otolaryngology consultation for peritonsillar abscess in the pediatric population [^115fcf83]. The Laryngoscope (2000). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess clinical outcomes of children seen in consultation for peritonsillar abscess treated without the routine use of computed tomography or needle aspiration.

- **Study design**: Retrospective review of patients evaluated in the emergency department for possible peritonsillar abscess. Patient outcomes are reviewed with a statistical analysis of children grouped according to age.

- **Methods**: A series of 102 patients, ages 8 months to 19 years, were evaluated by the emergency department with otolaryngology consultation for possible peritonsillar abscess. All patients were admitted and given intravenous fluid replacement, antibiotics, and analgesia. Patients who responded to 24 hours of medical treatment were discharged, whereas patients who did not respond underwent elective tonsillectomy.

- **Main outcome measure**: Outcome of patients evaluated for peritonsillar abscess treated without immediate surgery, needle aspiration, or computed tomography. Outcomes are correlated with age and clinical findings.

- **Results**: Fifty-two patients were discharged after initial medical therapy. Fifty patients underwent elective tonsillectomy; 40 of these patients were found to have abscesses at the time of surgery. When analyzed according to age, patients ages 8 months to 6 years were more likely to respond to medical treatment than children ages 7 to 12 and 12 to 19 (P = 0.023). Significant differences in the mean age of children requiring surgery (11.0 years) compared with those who responded to medical treatment (7.9 years) were observed (P = 0.003).

### The use of ultrasound imaging in evaluation of peritonsillar infections [^116v588D]. The Laryngoscope (2015). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the safety and patient tolerance of intraoral ultrasound, as well as its efficacy in diagnosing peritonsillar infections.

This prospective single-cohort study involved adult patients over 18 years old, who were evaluated for possible peritonsillar abscess. Twenty-four patients were assessed in the emergency department for peritonsillar infection. Signs and symptoms such as uvular deviation, trismus, and fluctuance were recorded. Intraoral ultrasound was performed, and the presence or absence of abscess was documented. Additionally, eight patients underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan. Needle aspiration was performed by an otolaryngology physician on appropriate patients. The presence of purulence confirmed a peritonsillar abscess.

Intraoral ultrasound was successfully performed on 87.5% (21/24) of patients. The probe could not access the peritonsillar space in 12.5% (3/24) of patients due to trismus. The positive predictive value of ultrasound in diagnosing an abscess was 78.6% (11/14), and the negative predictive value was 100% (7/7). The specificity was 70% (7/10), and the sensitivity was 100% (11/11). A CT scan of the neck, obtained in 8 out of 24 patients, was found to be 100% sensitive and specific in diagnosing an abscess.

In conclusion, intraoral ultrasound is a sensitive imaging modality at our institution and serves as a strong initial imaging choice in patients with peritonsillar infections. Ultrasound can reliably rule out the presence of an abscess, potentially eliminating the need for a CT scan of the neck.

### Observation of retropharyngeal fluid collection in 2 COVID-19 positive patients [^116HNG1U]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Retropharyngeal edema is defined as the presence of nonpurulent fluid within the retropharyngeal space. Although the disease process is not entirely understood, the fluid is thought to collect within the retropharyngeal space due to alterations in the lymphatic system. This accumulation of fluid is distinguishable on CT or magnetic resonance imaging. Etiologies include noninfectious causes, such as internal jugular vein thrombosis and radiotherapy, as well as infections originating around the retropharyngeal space.

- **Infections**: Infections in the retropharyngeal and surrounding spaces are potentially fatal, as they can spread to the carotid sheath and posterior mediastinum through what is known as the "danger space" and ultimately involve the heart and lungs.

Here, we have presented two cases of retropharyngeal edema that developed in COVID-19 positive patients and discussed presentation, treatment options, recovery, and early identification of retropharyngeal fluid collection on CT. Our understanding of the novel coronavirus has improved in recent months; however, there remains much we do not understand about the virus, and unique presentations, such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome, are abundant. We believe the two cases presented demonstrate COVID-19 as a potential infectious etiology for retropharyngeal edema. To our knowledge, retropharyngeal fluid collection has not been reported within the literature, although it has been documented that retropharyngeal infections have occurred in COVID-19 patients and arise more frequently in men.

In the cases described, because of benign findings on incision and drainage (I & D) in cases…

### Treatments and outcomes of adult parapharyngeal and retropharyngeal abscess: 1882 cases from a Japanese nationwide database [^111J2t18]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2022). High credibility.

Although parapharyngeal and retropharyngeal abscesses are potentially fatal deep neck abscesses, there is limited evidence for the treatment courses for adult patients with these abscesses. We aimed to describe the practice patterns and clinical outcomes of adult patients undergoing emergency surgery for parapharyngeal or retropharyngeal abscesses using a nationwide database.

We identified patients aged 18 years and older who underwent emergency surgery for parapharyngeal (para group, n = 1148) or retropharyngeal (retro group, n = 734) abscesses from July 2010 to March 2020 using a nationwide inpatient database. We performed between-group comparisons of the baseline characteristics, treatment course, and outcomes.

Compared with the retro group, the para group was more likely to be older (median, 66 vs. 60 years; P < 0.001) and have several comorbidities, such as diabetes (21% vs. 16%; P = 0.010) and epiglottitis (33% vs. 26%; P = 0.002), except for peritonsillar abscess (14% vs. 22%; P < 0.001) and tonsillitis (2.1% vs. 13%; P < 0.001). Regarding intravenous drugs administered within 2 days of admission, approximately half of the patients received steroids, non-antipseudomonal penicillins, and lincomycins. The para group received more comprehensive treatments, such as tracheostomy, intensive care unit admissions, and swallowing rehabilitation, compared to the retro group. Moreover, it demonstrated higher in-hospital mortality (2.7% vs. 1.1%; P = 0.017) and morbidity (16% vs. 9.7%; P < 0.001).

### Empiric treatment for peritonsillar abscess: A single-center experience with medical therapy alone [^1146d9xE]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2021). High credibility.

The purpose of this study was to compare the use of medical therapy alone (MTA) with surgical therapy (ST) for the empiric treatment of peritonsillar abscess (PTA).

A cohort of patients treated for PTA at our institution from May 2013 to February 2019 was analyzed. Demographics, disease characteristics, management strategies, and treatment outcomes were compared between the treatment groups. Primary outcomes included treatment failure, defined as the need for follow-up surgical intervention, and complications within two weeks of empiric treatment.

The results showed that 306 patients (72.7%) received MTA, while 115 (27.3%) underwent ST. There was no significant difference in the rate of treatment failure between the MTA (7.2%) and ST (6.1%) groups (p = 0.879). Complications were rare in both groups (1.6% with MTA versus 0.9% with ST; p = 0.898). Dysphagia (p = 0.011), trismus (p = 0.045), larger abscesses (p < 0.001), and hospital admission (p < 0.001) were more common in the ST group. Corticosteroid prescriptions were a common component of MTA (53.3%) and less often used with ST (33.9%; p = 0.001). After adjusting for abscess size, there remained no significant difference in the rate of treatment failure between groups. Univariate analyses demonstrated no significant independent predictors of treatment failure, including age, sex, race, tonsillitis history, smoking history, presenting signs and symptoms, abscess size, hospital admission, and corticosteroid prescriptions.

Conclusively, MTA may be a safe and effective alternative to surgical drainage for the empiric treatment of PTA.

### MRI of acute neck infections: Evidence summary and pictorial review [^116RdRPM]. Insights into Imaging (2023). Low credibility.

Pediatric neck infections, especially retropharyngeal and lateral lymphadenitis, present unique challenges. For many younger children who require MRI, sedation or anesthesia becomes necessary. Choosing an appropriate emergency imaging method for suspected neck infections involves balancing the potential harm of radiation against the possible immediate or long-term harm associated with anesthesia. About a third of children require sedation with spontaneous breathing, whereas a minority need general anesthesia and intubation.

The diagnostic accuracy of MRI and the clinical significance of MRI biomarkers, such as edema patterns, are similar between adults and children. However, there are anatomical differences in neck proportions and in the distribution and function of lymph nodes between the two groups. This results in differing profiles of neck infections that require emergency imaging. Children experience a higher number of retropharyngeal infections and lateral lymphadenitis compared with adults, who have more pharyngotonsillar and odontogenic infections.

Retropharyngeal infections in children can manifest as "true" deep infections bound by fascial planes of the deep space or as suppurative lymphadenitis (nodal abscess). The key to differentiating these on imaging is the collection's shape and location: the former often appears as a long, thin collection in the midline, while the latter presents as a rounded collection off-midline (paramedian). In cases of true abscess or significant infrahyoid extension of edema, imaging of the mediastinum may be warranted.

### Retropharyngeal abscess-like as an atypical presentation of Kawasaki disease: A case report and literature review [^116Sdkad]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Low credibility.

Forty-one percent of the patients had cardiac manifestations compared to less than twenty percent in the general pediatric population diagnosed with Kawasaki disease.

In summary, we present our patient and review 17 cases reported over 30 years (since 1990), presenting with clinical presentation and radiological findings consistent with the presence of a retropharyngeal abscess. Nearly all patients were treated with antibiotics and surgical exploration without improvement. All the cases responded promptly to IVIG therapy. Cardiac involvement was more common than expected in other cases of KD.

### Point of care ultrasound (POCUS) diagnosis of deep neck space abscess: A case series [^114E9zaH]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Para and retropharyngeal abscesses are deep neck infections of early childhood that can be complicated by serious sequelae such as airway obstruction, cervical necrotizing fasciitis, mediastinitis, aspiration pneumonia, jugular thrombosis, or aneurysm of the carotid artery. Traditionally, these infections were diagnosed with computed tomography (CT) of the neck, which exposes sensitive structures to radiation and may require sedation.

We present a case series of four children diagnosed using point of care ultrasound (POCUS) with para or retropharyngeal abscess later confirmed on CT. All four had alternative working diagnoses on pediatric emergency physician or otolaryngology physical examination prior to investigation with POCUS. We also describe a novel imaging approach that allows for easier identification of deep neck anatomic landmarks. Pediatric emergency physicians should be skilled in imaging the deep neck spaces in order to avoid delayed diagnosis of deep neck space abscess and its potentially catastrophic sequelae.
