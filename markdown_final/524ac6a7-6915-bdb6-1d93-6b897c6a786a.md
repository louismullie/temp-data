## Question

Simvastatin to atorvastatin conversion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about converting simvastatin to atorvastatin, specifically regarding dose equivalence, safety, and monitoring. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic and guideline-based intensity framework. Then, I should verify dose-equivalence data from head-to-head trials and meta-analyses. Next, I will review safety constraints, especially simvastatin 80 mg and drug interactions. After that, I need to consider patient-specific factors like risk category, age, and comorbidities. Finally, I will outline a practical conversion algorithm, monitoring, and follow-up plan, and I will double-check for any exceptions or caveats that could change management decisions.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and intensity framework, because I need to ensure the conversion preserves the intended LDL-C lowering intensity. High-intensity statins lower LDL-C by about 50% or more and include atorvastatin 40–80 mg and rosuvastatin 20–40 mg, whereas moderate-intensity regimens lower LDL-C by about 30–49% and include atorvastatin 10–20 mg, rosuvastatin 5–10 mg, and simvastatin 20–40 mg; simvastatin 10 mg is low intensity, and simvastatin 80 mg is not recommended for initiation or titration due to myopathy risk, which I should keep front and center as I map doses [^1e9724fd] [^180dfb34] [^fd7d5c32].

> Wait, let me verify the dose-equivalence data before I commit to a fixed ratio. A dose-specific meta-analysis of randomized trials indicates atorvastatin is roughly 2–4 times more potent than simvastatin for LDL-C lowering, supporting a simvastatin-to-atorvastatin milligram ratio around 2:1 to 4:1, with the most consistent mapping placing simvastatin 20 mg near atorvastatin 10 mg and simvastatin 40 mg near atorvastatin 20 mg, acknowledging that HDL effects differ and simvastatin tends to raise HDL more at higher doses [^a6184d3c]. I should also cross-check with guideline tables and contemporary summaries that list simvastatin 20–40 mg as moderate intensity and atorvastatin 10–20 mg as moderate intensity, reinforcing that simvastatin 20 mg aligns with atorvastatin 10 mg and simvastatin 40 mg aligns with atorvastatin 20 mg for LDL-C lowering expectations [^1e9724fd] [^180dfb34] [^fd7d5c32].

> Hold on, I should verify the upper-end conversion carefully, because simvastatin 80 mg is a special case. Given the FDA warning against initiating or titrating to simvastatin 80 mg due to myopathy risk, conversion should not aim for an atorvastatin dose that merely matches simvastatin 80 mg milligram-for-milligram; instead, I should convert to high-intensity atorvastatin, typically 40–80 mg, recognizing that atorvastatin 40 mg generally achieves greater LDL-C reduction than simvastatin 80 mg and that atorvastatin 80 mg is reserved for patients who need maximal LDL-C lowering and can tolerate it, with close monitoring for hepatotoxicity and muscle symptoms [^1e9724fd] [^180dfb34] [^fd7d5c32]. I initially thought simvastatin 80 mg might map to atorvastatin 40 mg on a 2:1 basis, but wait, that understates atorvastatin's potency; atorvastatin 40 mg typically lowers LDL-C by about 46–51%, which exceeds simvastatin 80 mg's effect, so the correct approach is to use atorvastatin 40–80 mg when converting from simvastatin 80 mg, individualized to tolerance and LDL-C goal [^af3ee97d] [^a6184d3c].

> Next, I should review safety and drug–drug interactions, because these can override simple dose mapping. Simvastatin is metabolized by CYP3A4 and is vulnerable to interactions with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, which increase exposure and myopathy risk; atorvastatin is also CYP3A4-metabolized, but the FDA explicitly advises against simvastatin 80 mg and highlights interaction risks, whereas atorvastatin does not carry a blanket 80 mg prohibition, though caution is still warranted at high doses and with interacting drugs [^1e9724fd] [^180dfb34] [^fd7d5c32]. I need to check for interacting agents like azole antifungals, macrolides, HIV protease inhibitors, and others, and adjust the atorvastatin dose or choose an alternative statin if interaction risk is high, prioritizing safety and tolerability [^notfound].

> I will now examine patient-specific factors that modify the conversion. For very high-risk patients, such as those with clinical ASCVD or LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, I should target high-intensity therapy when tolerated, so simvastatin 40 mg would convert to atorvastatin 40–80 mg rather than 20 mg, while simvastatin 20 mg would convert to atorvastatin 20–40 mg if higher intensity is indicated; conversely, in older adults, those with prior statin intolerance, or multiple interacting drugs, I should favor moderate intensity and consider lower starting doses with cautious titration, balancing efficacy and safety [^1e9724fd] [^180dfb34] [^fd7d5c32]. But wait, what if the patient is on simvastatin 10 mg? That is low intensity, so converting to atorvastatin 5–10 mg would be reasonable if the goal is to maintain low intensity, or to 10–20 mg if intensification is desired and tolerated [^1e9724fd] [^180dfb34] [^fd7d5c32].

> Let me synthesize a practical conversion algorithm, and I will double-check each step against the evidence before finalizing. For simvastatin 10 mg, convert to atorvastatin 5–10 mg if maintaining low intensity, or 10–20 mg if intensifying; for simvastatin 20 mg, convert to atorvastatin 10–20 mg, typically 10 mg to match moderate intensity; for simvastatin 40 mg, convert to atorvastatin 20–40 mg, typically 20 mg to match moderate intensity; for simvastatin 80 mg, convert to atorvastatin 40–80 mg to achieve high intensity while avoiding the myopathy risk of simvastatin 80 mg, with close monitoring and dose individualization based on tolerance and LDL-C response [^a6184d3c] [^1e9724fd] [^180dfb34] [^fd7d5c32].

> I should confirm the monitoring plan, because conversion without follow-up risks under- or overtreatment. Check a fasting lipid panel 4–12 weeks after the switch to assess LDL-C response, liver enzymes if clinically indicated, and ask about muscle symptoms; if LDL-C is above goal, titrate atorvastatin upward in 10–20 mg increments to the maximally tolerated dose, and if still above goal, add ezetimibe or consider a PCSK9 inhibitor per guideline pathways, recognizing that doubling a statin dose yields only about 6% additional LDL-C reduction on average [^1e9724fd] [^180dfb34] [^fd7d5c32] [^e93acd3f]. Hold on, I should verify that this incremental effect size is consistent; yes, pooled analyses show a 4–7% additional LDL-C reduction with dose doubling, supporting combination therapy when additional lowering is needed [^e93acd3f].

> Let me consider special scenarios that could alter the conversion. If the patient is on a CYP3A4 inhibitor that is unavoidable, I should avoid simvastatin and use a lower atorvastatin dose or choose a statin with fewer CYP3A4 interactions, such as pravastatin or rosuvastatin, to mitigate myopathy risk; if the patient has documented statin-associated muscle symptoms, I should use a lower starting dose, consider alternate-day or intermittent dosing with a longer half-life statin, or switch to a hydrophilic agent with different metabolism, documenting tolerance and response carefully [^9315d9a5] [^aec55ff0] [^d91b11df]. I need to ensure I also account for age, renal function, and diabetes, as these can influence both potency needs and tolerability, guiding dose selection and titration cadence [^1e9724fd] [^180dfb34] [^fd7d5c32].

> In summary, I should double-check that the conversion preserves the intended statin intensity and addresses safety. A reliable, evidence-aligned approach is simvastatin 10 mg to atorvastatin 5–10 mg, simvastatin 20 mg to atorvastatin 10 mg, simvastatin 40 mg to atorvastatin 20 mg, and simvastatin 80 mg to atorvastatin 40–80 mg, with individualized adjustments for risk category, tolerability, and drug interactions, followed by lipid monitoring and stepwise intensification if needed [^a6184d3c] [^1e9724fd] [^180dfb34] [^fd7d5c32].

When converting simvastatin to atorvastatin, **atorvastatin is more potent** [^a6184d3c], so lower milligram doses are needed to match LDL-C lowering. Use a **2:1 to 3:1 simvastatin:atorvastatin ratio** (e.g. simvastatin 20–40 mg ≈ atorvastatin 10–20 mg; simvastatin 40–80 mg ≈ atorvastatin 20–40 mg) [^a6184d3c] [^af3ee97d]. Avoid simvastatin 80 mg due to myopathy risk [^1e9724fd]; convert to atorvastatin 40–80 mg if high-intensity therapy is needed [^fd7d5c32]. Monitor lipids 4–12 weeks after switching and adjust to the lowest effective dose to maintain LDL-C goals and minimize adverse effects [^1e9724fd].

---

## Pharmacological differences influencing conversion

Simvastatin and atorvastatin differ in **potency, pharmacokinetics, and drug interactions**, which guide conversion:

- **Potency**: Atorvastatin is 2–4 times more potent than simvastatin for LDL-C lowering, so lower mg doses achieve comparable effects [^a6184d3c] [^13f43368].
- **Half-life**: Atorvastatin has a longer half-life (~14 h) than simvastatin (~2–3 h), enabling once-daily dosing and steadier LDL-C control [^7a0564e6].
- **Metabolism**: Both are CYP3A4 substrates, but simvastatin has higher myopathy risk, especially at 80 mg or with CYP3A4 inhibitors [^1e9724fd] [^b44e70ec].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dose conversion

Head-to-head trials and meta-analyses inform **dose equivalence**:

| **Simvastatin dose** | **Atorvastatin dose** | **Expected ldl-c reduction** |
|-|-|-|
| 10 mg | 5–10 mg | ~30% |
| 20 mg | 10 mg | ~30–40% |
| 40 mg | 20 mg | ~40–50% |
| 80 mg | 40–80 mg | ≥ 50% |

---

These mappings align with the **2:1 to 3:1 simvastatin:atorvastatin ratio** and guideline intensity categories [^1e9724fd] [^180dfb34].

---

## Recommended conversion strategy

Based on potency and safety, **use the following conversions**:

- **Simvastatin 10 mg**: Convert to atorvastatin 5–10 mg (low intensity).
- **Simvastatin 20 mg**: Convert to atorvastatin 10 mg (moderate intensity).
- **Simvastatin 40 mg**: Convert to atorvastatin 20 mg (moderate intensity).
- **Simvastatin 80 mg**: Convert to atorvastatin 40–80 mg (high intensity) only if high-intensity therapy is indicated and monitored closely [^1e9724fd].

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

- **Myopathy risk**: Avoid simvastatin 80 mg; if converting from it, use atorvastatin 40–80 mg cautiously with monitoring [^1e9724fd].
- **Drug interactions**: Review CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. amiodarone, diltiazem, verapamil, azole antifungals) and adjust doses or choose alternatives to reduce myopathy risk [^9315d9a5].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Consider age, renal/hepatic function, and comorbidities when selecting the final dose [^9503c6c1].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

After switching, **obtain a fasting lipid panel 4–12 weeks later** to assess LDL-C response and adherence, then monitor every 3–12 months as clinically indicated. Assess for muscle symptoms and check CK if symptoms occur, especially with high-intensity dosing or interactions [^1e9724fd].

---

## Clinical outcomes and safety profile

Clinical trials show that **atorvastatin achieves greater LDL-C reductions** than simvastatin at comparable doses, with similar or improved cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk patients [^afa873a5] [^dc70161d]. Atorvastatin has a favorable safety profile, though liver enzyme elevations and myalgias can occur; serious myopathy is rare but risk rises with higher doses and interacting drugs [^afa873a5].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Start low, titrate to goal**: Begin at the converted dose and titrate to LDL-C target based on response and tolerance [^1e9724fd].
- **Patient education**: Explain reasons for switching, expected benefits, and warning signs of myopathy [^notfound].
- **Alternative therapies**: If atorvastatin is not tolerated, consider rosuvastatin, pravastatin, or ezetimibe-based regimens per guidelines [^1e9724fd].

---

Converting simvastatin to atorvastatin uses a **2:1 to 3:1 ratio**, with atorvastatin requiring lower mg doses for comparable LDL-C lowering. Avoid simvastatin 80 mg and monitor lipids and tolerability after switching to ensure safe, effective lipid control [^a6184d3c] [^1e9724fd].

### A dose-specific meta-analysis of lipid changes in randomized controlled trials of atorvastatin and simvastatin [^a6184d3c]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The available statins exhibit differences in the potency with which they alter serum lipid levels.

Objective

Meta-analyses were conducted to assess the relative potency of atorvastatin and simvastatin (the 2 most commonly prescribed statins) across all possible dose combinations in terms of changes in total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C).

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, National Health Service (NHS) Centre for Reviews and Dissemination database, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects were searched for randomized, head-to-head trials of atorvastatin and simvastatin in patients aged ≥ 18 years with elevated levels of serum TC and LDL-C. Reference lists of the identified articles, letters, and editorials also were reviewed. The manufacturers of atorvastatin and simvastatin products were contacted for relevant unpublished data. All studies were reviewed and rated for quality by 2 independent reviewers. The maximum quality score was 4 points; trials with a score of < 2 points were considered to be of poor quality and were excluded from analysis. Dose comparisons were abstracted in pairs from each trial. Meta-analyses were conducted on the fixed-dose pairs for each lipid parameter. Weighted mean differences in the change in TC, LDL-C, TG, and HDL-C were estimated using the Der Simonian and Laird random-effects model.

Results

Seventeen published trials and 1 unpublished study were included in the meta-analyses. Atorvastatin treatment was associated with significantly greater reductions in TC, LDL-C, and TG in the majority of dose comparisons with simvastatin. The potency of atorvastatin and simvastatin was comparable at dose ratios between 1:2 and 1:4. Higher doses of simvastatin were more effective in increasing HDL-C levels than atorvastatin, with no apparent dose-equivalence point. The HDL-C advantage of simvastatin was greatest when simvastatin 80 mg was compared with atorvastatin 80 mg (weighted mean difference, -4.35%; 95% CI, -5.64 to -3.08, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

In these meta-analyses, atorvastatin was 2 to 4 times as potent as simvastatin in reducing TC, LDL-C, and TG, indicating that the dose equivalence of atorvastatin and simvastatin lay between 1:2 and 1:4. In contrast, simvastatin was more effective than atorvastatin in increasing HDL-C, but without any indication of a point of dose equivalence.

### Are statins created equal? Evidence from randomized trials of pravastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin for cardiovascular disease prevention [^e3345b02]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The relative efficacy of different statins for long-term cardiovascular prevention remains largely undetermined.

Methods

Using adjusted indirect comparison, we compared 3 statins (pravastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin) based on published randomized placebo-controlled trials for long-term cardiovascular prevention. A systematic literature search between 1980 and 2004 was conducted. Randomized placebo-controlled trials of the 3 statins, which studied cardiovascular diseases or death as the outcome, enrolled ≥ 1000 participants, and had ≥ 1-year follow-up, were included. Trials were grouped according to the statin under study. A pooled relative risk (RR) was derived from each set of trials using a random-effects model. Adjusted indirect comparisons using pooled RRs were made between statins with regard to prespecified clinical outcomes.

Results

Eight placebo-controlled trials met the inclusion criteria, including 4 pravastatin trials (n = 25,572), 2 simvastatin trials (n = 24,980), and 2 atorvastatin trials (n = 13,143). All trials had a similar degree of lipid reduction. Graphical and statistical assessments showed minimal heterogeneity in the trials' effect sizes. Adjusted indirect comparisons did not reveal a statistically significant difference between statins in reducing fatal coronary heart disease and nonfatal myocardial infarctions (simvastatin vs pravastatin: RR 0.93 [95% CI 0.84–1.03]; atorvastatin vs simvastatin: RR 0.84 [95% CI 0.66–1.08]; atorvastatin vs pravastatin: RR 0.79 [95% CI 0.61–1.02]). We were unable to detect differences either in outcomes for fatal and nonfatal strokes, all cardiovascular deaths, and all-cause mortality.

Conclusion

Evidence from published statin randomized placebo-controlled trials suggests that pravastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin, when used at their standard dosages, show no statistically significant difference in their effect on long-term cardiovascular prevention.

### Approximate equivalent rosuvastatin doses for temporary statin interchange programs [^4681e2c6]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate approximate doses of rosuvastatin equivalent to the other hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) for a temporary substitution program.

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted to locate clinical trials directly comparing rosuvastatin with other statins that evaluated the magnitude of cholesterol lowering.

Data Synthesis

The mean low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol values from the clinical trials were assessed. Study results indicate that rosuvastatin is not equivalent to other statins on a milligram-to-milligram basis.

Conclusions

Rosuvastatin appears to be at least 2 and 4 times as potent as atorvastatin and simvastatin, respectively, and at least 8 times as potent as pravastatin and lovastatin.

### Impact of switching from high-efficacy lipid-lowering therapies to generic simvastatin on LDL-C levels and LDL-C goal attainment among high-risk primary and secondary prevention populations in the United Kingdom [^24acf7cd]. Clinical Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

High cholesterol, especially high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity/mortality. Switching from high-efficacy lipid-lowering therapies (HETs) to simvastatin might lead to sub-optimal control of LDL-C. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of switching from HETs to generic simvastatin on LDL-C levels and LDL-C goal attainment among the high-risk primary and secondary prevention populations in the United Kingdom.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study was conducted using Clinical Practice Research Datalink database. Included were individuals with more than 2 months of prescriptions of the following HETs between August 1, 2004 and December 31, 2008: simvastatin/ezetimibe fixed dose (S/E), simvastatin and ezetimibe co-administration (S+E), atorvastatin and ezetimibe co-administration (A+E), rosuvastatin and ezetimibe co-administration (R+E), rosuvastatin monotherapy, and atorvastatin monotherapy. For each baseline HET, we used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to estimate the least squares mean (LSM) difference in the percentage change from baseline in LDL-C between switchers and non-switchers, and logistic regression to estimate the odds ratio of attaining the LDL-C goal (< 3 mmol/L for primary prevention and < 2 mmol/L for secondary prevention, by JBS2) at follow-up. Propensity score adjusted analyses were conducted to reduce selection bias.

Findings

30,148 patients met the eligibility criteria with 83.8% received atorvastatin, 9.5% rosuvastatin and 2.6% S/E and S+E combined. 89.1% of patients switching from atorvastatin switched to an equivalent or higher dose of simvastatin (dose equivalency was determined by relative efficacy of one statin to other statins), while 100% of those switching from simvastatin/ezetimibe and 96.8% of those switching from rosuvastatin switched to lower than equivalent dose of simvastatin. Compared to non-switchers, the adjusted least squares mean differences in the percentage change in LDL-C levels from baseline were 18.74% (p = 0.0003), 16.73% (p < 0.0001), and -0.11% (p = 0.9044) when switching from simvastatin/ezetimibe, rosuvastatin, and atorvastatin, respectively. The odds of LDL-C goal attainment at follow-up among switchers from simvastatin/ezetimibe, rosuvastatin, and atorvastatin were 0.40 (95% CI: 0.23–0.70), 0.36 (95% CI: 0.26–0.51) and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.92–1.15) relative to non-switchers respectively.

Implications

Among the high risk CVD population in UK, switching to simvastatin from HET, especially rosuvastatin and simvastatin/ezetimibe, resulted in an increase in LDL-C levels and lower goal attainment. These historical data reinforce the appropriateness of the changes in the new Joint British Guideline (JBS3) which no longer recommends starting simvastatin 40 mg.

### Switching from high-efficacy lipid-lowering therapies to simvastatin and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal attainment in coronary heart disease / coronary heart disease-equivalent patients [^2b7213d4]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The availability of generic simvastatin in 2006 has prompted substantial changes in formulary recommendations for lipid-management agents.

Objective

To assess the impact of switches from high-efficacy lipid-lowering therapy to simvastatin on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and goal attainment in coronary heart disease (CHD) or CHD risk-equivalent patients in a managed care setting.

Methods

In this retrospective observational study, we estimated the least squares mean difference in the percent change from baseline LDL-C and the odds ratios for LDL-C goal attainment rates (< 100 mg/dL and < 70 mg/dL) at follow-up for each baseline high-efficacy lipid-lowering therapy with the analysis of covariance and logistic regressions, respectively.

Results

We identified 18,061 patients who, between September 1, 2004 and October 31, 2008, were either switched from or remained on their initial high-efficacy LDL-C lowering therapy: ezetimibe/simvastatin fixed-dose combination (E/S), rosuvastatin, or atorvastatin. The difference in percent change in LDL-C levels from baseline were 25.2 (95% confidence interval 21.2–29.2), 13.0 (6.0–20.0), and 3.1 (0.3–5.9) greater in switchers to simvastatin in the E/S, rosuvastatin, and atorvastatin comparisons, respectively, after adjusting for age, sex, and starting dose of the initial therapy. For switchers, the percent of patients at LDL-C < 100 mg/dL at follow-up decreased from 83.5% to 63.8% in the E/S, 67.7% to 52.7% in the rosuvastatin, and 65.1% to 60.2% in the atorvastatin cohorts. The percent of patients at LDL-C < 70 mg/dL at follow-up was lower for all switcher groups compared with nonswitchers.

Conclusions

Among CHD/CHD risk-equivalent patients, switching to simvastatin was associated with increases in LDL-C levels and lower LDL-C goal attainment rates. The public health impact of this phenomenon on population risk and CHD events remains to be determined.

### Comparison of the efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin across doses (STELLAR* trial) [^1b5db209]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

The primary objective of this 6-week, parallel-group, open-label, randomized, multicenter trial was to compare rosuvastatin with atorvastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin across dose ranges for reduction of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Secondary objectives included comparing rosuvastatin with comparators for other lipid modifications and achievement of National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III and Joint European Task Force LDL cholesterol goals. After a dietary lead-in period, 2,431 adults with hypercholesterolemia (LDL cholesterol ≥ 160 and < 250 mg/dl; triglycerides < 400 mg/dl) were randomized to treatment with rosuvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg; atorvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg; simvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg; or pravastatin 10, 20, or 40 mg. At 6 weeks, across-dose analyses showed that rosuvastatin 10 to 80 mg reduced LDL cholesterol by a mean of 8.2% more than atorvastatin 10 to 80 mg, 26% more than pravastatin 10 to 40 mg, and 12% to 18% more than simvastatin 10 to 80 mg (all p < 0.001). Mean percent changes in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the rosuvastatin groups were +7.7% to +9.6% compared with +2.1% to +6.8% in all other groups. Across dose ranges, rosuvastatin reduced total cholesterol significantly more (p < 0.001) than all comparators and triglycerides significantly more (p < 0.001) than simvastatin and pravastatin. Adult Treatment Panel III LDL cholesterol goals were achieved by 82% to 89% of patients treated with rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg compared with 69% to 85% of patients treated with atorvastatin 10 to 80 mg; the European LDL cholesterol goal of < 3.0 mmol/L was achieved by 79% to 92% in rosuvastatin groups compared with 52% to 81% in atorvastatin groups. Drug tolerability was similar across treatments.

### Achieving LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B target levels in high-risk patients: measuring effective reductions in cholesterol using rosuvastatin therapY (MERCURY) II [^cea71f49]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines for patients at a high risk of coronary heart disease set a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) target of < 100 mg/dL. This target can be difficult to attain with diet and current therapy.

Methods

In a 16-week multinational trial, 1993 high-risk patients were randomized to rosuvastatin 20 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg, atorvastatin 20 mg, simvastatin 20 mg, or simvastatin 40 mg for 8 weeks. Patients either remained on starting treatment or switched to lower or milligram-equivalent doses of rosuvastatin for 8 more weeks.

Results

At 16 weeks, more patients achieved their LDL-C target by switching to rosuvastatin 10 mg than staying on atorvastatin 10 mg (66% vs 42%, P < .001) or simvastatin 20 mg (73% vs 32%, P < .001). Changing to rosuvastatin 20 mg brought more patients to their LDL-C target than staying on atorvastatin 20 mg (79% vs 64%, P < .001) or simvastatin 40 mg (84% vs 56%, P < .001). More very high risk patients achieved an LDL-C target of < 70 mg/dL when changed to rosuvastatin from atorvastatin or simvastatin (within-arm comparisons P < .01). More hypertriglyceridemic patients (triglycerides ≥ 200 mg/dL) met LDL-C, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and apolipoprotein B targets by changing to rosuvastatin. Switching to rosuvastatin produced greater reductions in LDL-C, total cholesterol, non-HDL-C, apolipoprotein B, and lipid ratios. All treatments were well tolerated, with no differences among treatment groups in skeletal muscle, hepatic, or renal toxicity.

Conclusion

Rosuvastatin 10 or 20 mg is an effective and safe therapeutic option for high-risk patients to achieve their lipid and apolipoprotein targets.

### Investigating the prevalence, predictors, and prognosis of suboptimal statin use early after a non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome [^43ba5e73]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2016). Low credibility.

Previous secondary prevention cohorts have reported elevated risk estimates for statin nonadherence or discontinuation/persistence of 1.01–5.26 for MACE and 1.25–5.00 for mortality, with the majority reporting statistically significant results. Our study results of increased adjusted risks of time to MACE or ACM associated with both suboptimal statin use and the statin nonadherence/discontinuation subgroup in particular are in keeping with these findings. This emphazises the generalizability of these clinically relevant findings across secondary prevention populations, settings, and study designs.

In this study of NSTE-ACS patients, the statin dose reduction/switching statin subgroup was not significantly associated with increased risks of time to MACE or ACM. One other prospective study has investigated statin dose reduction/switching after ACS, but included both NSTE-ACS and ST-elevation ACS patients and reported a significantly increased risk for adverse clinical outcomes (HR 2.7, 95% CI 1.7–5.1). Our smaller number of dose reduction/switching cases (n = 61) may have accounted for this subgroup only showing a nonsignificant trend for increased risk. Two other observational studies have investigated the influence of switching from atorvastatin to simvastatin, on cardiovascular events, using mixed primary/secondary prevention populations identified using electronic healthcare databases. The UK-based study found a modestly increased cardiovascular event risk (HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.02–1.64), whereas the US-based study found no association. However, in both these studies, most patients were on atorvastatin ≤ 20 mg/day, and it has been noted that the proportion of switches from atorvastatin to a lower rather than equivalently potent simvastatin regimen increases as the initial atorvastatin dose increases. This is particularly relevant in post-ACS patients, as practically all switches from atorvastatin 80 mg/day are to another statin of lower equivalent potency. Overall, persistent adherence to high-potency statin therapy after an ACS appears optimal; however, if necessary, reducing the dose or switching statin appears preferable to statin nonadherence or complete discontinuation.

### Individualized dose-response to statins associated with cardiovascular disease outcomes [^53e3321d]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Current standards of care rely on clinical risk factors to inform choice of statin intensity, and our findings regarding the impact of dose-response traits on ASCVD outcomes suggest that approaches to statin therapy could be further refined by incorporating ED 50 and E max into automated clinical decision support if/when these traits are more readily available. Deidentified EHRs provide a rich repository of real-world, practice-based clinical data that can be utilized for applications of pharmacogenetic research, including investigations of dose-response that are not feasible in the clinical trial setting. Furthermore, data from routine care may better reflect the actualities of day-to-day clinical medicine because practice-based data contain the full width and breadth of demographic factors and relevant clinical comorbidities, while randomized trials apply numerous exclusions and control for as many elements as possible in order to resolve their specific desired endpoint.

Individualized statin dose-response

In this study, we demonstrate that dose-response traits describing the relationship between statin use — specifically atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin — and LDL-C changes can be obtained following data extraction of statin exposure events and LDL-C measurements from longitudinal clinical data. As anticipated, the order of potency was simvastatin < atorvastatin < rosuvastatin. Although estimated measures of efficacy represented by E max were similar across statin types, there was much more variability in the distribution of efficacy for simvastatin compared to atorvastatin or rosuvastatin, which aligns with prior studies finding that some patients are unable to reduce LDL-C to the desired target despite dose escalation and close follow-up. From our results, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin exhibit the most consistent lipid-lowering effect, and this finding supports the use of these statin agents as high-intensity statins for primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD.

Statin exposure

For the dose-response analyses, we generated a statin exposure variable, taking into account the different statins and their relative potency as well as SLCO1B1 genotype and pharmacokinetic interactions with co-administered drugs known to affect statin concentrations to a clinically relevant extent. When generating the predicted statin exposure variable, equipotent doses was converted using simvastatin as reference, e.g. 10 mg atorvastatin was defined an exposure similar to 20 mg simvastatin, 10 mg rosuvastatin as an exposure similar to 40 mg simvastatin, and 10 mg pravastatin as an exposure similar to 5 mg simvastatin. As pharmacokinetic differences may alter the effective dose of statins, the calculated dose equivalents were corrected for the expected exposure changes of drug-drug interactions. To identify potential pharmacokinetic drug interactions with statins, we searched a database established by the Norwegian Medicines Agency. Three identified interactions were considered of clinical relevance among the included simvastatin-treated patients, and those were amlodipine, diltiazem and amiodarone, which are CYP3A4 inhibitors increasing serum levels of simvastatin about 1.5-fold, 3-fold, and 1.7-fold, respectively. For atorvastatin, pravastatin and rosuvastatin, no clinically relevant interactions were identified in the database searches.

Statin therapy evidence notes and FDA caution — dose considerations for atorvastatin and simvastatin: All of these randomized controlled trials demonstrated a reduction in major cardiovascular events, and individual responses to statin therapy varied in RCTs and should be expected to vary in clinical practice. Evidence from 1 RCT only supports down-titration if unable to tolerate atorvastatin 80 mg in the IDEAL study. Although simvastatin 80 mg was evaluated in RCTs, initiation of simvastatin 80 mg or titration to 80 mg is not recommended by the FDA because of the increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^0ada0523]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In a multicenter, double-blind, 6 week study, 1,902 patients with primary hyperlipidemia, who had not met their NCEP ATP III target LDL-C goal, were randomized to one of eight treatment groups: ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets (10 mg/10 mg, 10 mg/20 mg, 10 mg/40 mg, or 10 mg/80 mg) or atorvastatin (10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, or 80 mg).

Across the dosage range, when patients receiving ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets were compared to those receiving milligram-equivalent statin doses of atorvastatin, ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets lowered total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and non-HDL-C significantly more than atorvastatin. Only the 10 mg/40 mg and 10 mg/80 mg ezetimibe and simvastatin tablet doses increased HDL-C significantly more than the corresponding milligram-equivalent statin dose of atorvastatin. The effects of ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets on TG were similar to the effects seen with atorvastatin (see Table 9).

In a multicenter, double-blind, 24 week, forced-titration study, 788 patients with primary hyperlipidemia, who had not met their NCEP ATP III target LDL-C goal, were randomized to receive coadministered ezetimibe and simvastatin equivalent to ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets (10 mg/10 mg and 10 mg/20 mg) or atorvastatin 10 mg. For all three treatment groups, the dose of the statin was titrated at 6 week intervals to 80 mg. At each pre-specified dose comparison, ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets lowered LDL-C to a greater degree than atorvastatin (see Table 10).

### Comparison of efficacy and safety of atorvastatin (10mg) with simvastatin (10mg) at six weeks. ASSET investigators [^dfce9b8f]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

The 6-week efficacy and safety of atorvastatin versus simvastatin was determined during a 54-week, open-label, multicenter, parallel-arm, treat-to-target study. In all, 1,424 patients with mixed dyslipidemia (triglyceride 200 to 600 mg/dl [2.26 to 6.77 mmol/L]) were stratified to 1 of 2 groups (diabetes or no diabetes). Patients were then randomized to receive either atorvastatin 10 mg/ day (n = 730) or simvastatin 10 mg/day (n = 694). Efficacy was determined by measuring changes from baseline in lipid parameters including low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B. Compared with simvastatin, atorvastatin produced significantly greater (p < 0.0001) reductions from baseline in LDL cholesterol (37.2% vs 29.6%), total cholesterol (27.6% vs 21.5%), triglycerides (22.1% vs 16.0%), the ratio of LDL cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (41.1% vs 33.7%), and apolipoprotein B (28.3% vs 21.2%), and a comparable increase from baseline in HDL cholesterol (7.4% vs 6.9%). Atorvastatin was also significantly (p < 0.0001) more effective than simvastatin at treating the overall patient population to LDL cholesterol goals (55.6% vs 38.4%). Fewer than 6% of patients in either treatment group experienced drug-attributable adverse events, which were mostly mild to moderate in nature. Diabetic patients treated with either statin had safety characteristics similar to nondiabetics, with atorvastatin exhibiting superior efficacy to simvastatin. In conclusion, atorvastatin, at a dose of 10 mg/day, is more effective than simvastatin 10 mg/day at lowering lipids and reaching LDL cholesterol goals in patients with mixed dyslipidemia. Both statins are well tolerated with safety profiles similar to other members of the statin class.

Efficacy of More Intensive Therapy With Respect to Target Levels

The percentage of patients who achieved on‐treatment target levels for LDL‐C (< 2.33 mmol/L, < 90 mg/dL), non–HDL‐C (< 2.85 mmol/L, < 110 mg/dL), and LDL‐P (< 990 nmol/L) corresponding to the 20th population equivalent of the MESA cohort are shown in Figure 7 A. With the starting dose of statin (either simvastatin 40 mg/day or atorvastatin 20 mg/day), ∼41.1% of the patients achieved target levels for LDL‐C, 37.7% were at target levels for LDL‐P, and 26.8% for non–HDL‐C. After 6 weeks of treatment with all 3 intensive lipid‐lowering therapies, the percentages of patients who achieved target levels of LDL‐C and LDL‐P increased substantially, with the largest improvements in LDL‐C. Percent achievement of LDL‐C target levels was 51.4% for doubling the statin dose, 72.2% for switching to R10, and 75.2% for switching to ES10/20. The percentages of patient attainment for LDL‐P were 54.1%, 57.0%, and 62.4% for doubling the statin dose and switching to R10 and ES10/20, respectively. Percentages of patient attainment for non–HDL‐C were 62.2%, 57.0%, and 64.7%, respectively, for statin dose‐doubling and switching to R10 and to ES10/20.

### Dose-comparison study of the combination of ezetimibe and simvastatin (vytorin) versus atorvastatin in patients with hypercholesterolemia: the vytorin versus atorvastatin (VYVA) study [^b2dc8194]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is the primary therapeutic target in the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) guidelines. This study tested the hypothesis that ezetimibe/simvastatin, a lipid-lowering agent that inhibits both intestinal cholesterol absorption and cholesterol synthesis, provides greater LDL-C reductions than atorvastatin across dose ranges.

Methods

This multicenter, double-blind, 6-week parallel-group study randomized 1902 patients with LDL-C above ATP III goal to atorvastatin (10, 20, 40, or 80 mg) or to ezetimibe/simvastatin (10/10, 10/20, 10/40, or 10/80 mg). Patients were stratified by prerandomization LDL-C level.

Results

At each milligram-equivalent statin dose comparison, and averaged across doses, ezetimibe/simvastatin provided greater LDL-C reductions (47%-59%) than atorvastatin (36%-53%). Ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/40 and 10/80 mg also provided significantly greater high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) increases than atorvastatin 40 and 80 mg. Triglyceride reductions were similar for all comparisons. More ezetimibe/simvastatin than atorvastatin patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or CHD risk equivalents attained the ATP III LDL-C goal of < 100 mg/dL and the optional LDL-C target of < 70 mg/dL. C-reactive protein reductions were similar between treatment groups. Consecutive elevations in alanine aminotransferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase occurred in significantly more atorvastatin patients than ezetimibe/simvastatin patients. No myopathy or liver-related adverse events led to study discontinuation with either drug.

Conclusions

Ezetimibe/simvastatin was more effective than atorvastatin in lowering LDL-C at each dose comparison and provided greater increases in HDL-C at the 40- and 80-mg statin dose. Ezetimibe/simvastatin is a highly efficacious, well-tolerated treatment option for hypercholesterolemic patients.

### Effects of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin on non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoproteins, and lipid ratios in patients with hypercholesterolemia: additional results from the STELLAR trial [^08f22531]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apolipoprotein (apo) B, and lipid and apolipoprotein ratios that include both atherogenic and antiatherogenic lipid components have been found to be strong predictors of coronary heart disease risk.

Objective

The goal of this study was to examine prospectively the effects of rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin across dose ranges on non-HDL-C, apo B, apo A-I, and total cholesterol (TC):HDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C):HDL-C, non-HDL-C:HDL-C, and apo B:apo A-I ratios in patients with hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL and < 250 mg/dL and triglycerides < 400 mg/dL) in the Statin Therapies for Elevated Lipid Levels compared Across doses to Rosuvastatin (STELLAR) trial.

Methods

In this randomized, Multicenter, parallel-group, open-label trial (4522IL/0065), patients ≥ 18 years of age received rosuvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg; atorvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg; simvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg; or pravastatin 10, 20, or 40 mg for 6 weeks. Pairwise comparisons were prospectively planned and performed between rosuvastatin 10, 20, and 40 mg and milligram-equivalent or higher doses of comparators.

Results

A total of 2268 patients were randomized to the rosuvastatin 10- to 40-mg, atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin groups. Fifty-one percent of patients were women, the mean (SD) age was 57 (12) years, and 19% had a documented history of atherosclerotic disease. Over 6 weeks, rosuvastatin significantly reduced non-HDL-C, apo B, and all lipid and apolipoprotein ratios assessed, compared with milligram-equivalent doses of atorvastatin and milligram-equivalent or higher doses of simvastatin and pravastatin (all, P < 0.002). Rosuvastatin reduced non-HDL-C by 42.0% to 50.9% compared with 34.4% to 48.1% with atorvastatin, 26.0% to 41.8% with simvastatin, and 18.6% to 27.4% with pravastatin. Rosuvastatin reduced apo B by 36.7% to 45.3% compared with 29.4% to 42.9% with atorvastatin, 22.2% to 34.7% with simvastatin, and 14.7% to 23.0% with pravastatin. The highest increase in apo A-I (8.8%) was observed in the rosuvastatin 20-mg group, and this increase was significantly greater than in the atorvastatin 40-mg and 80-mg groups (both, P < 0.002).

Conclusion

Rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg was more efficacious in improving the lipid profile of patients with hypercholesterolemia than milligram-equivalent doses of atorvastatin and milligram-equivalent or higher doses of simvastatin and pravastatin.

### Disparate effects of atorvastatin compared with simvastatin on C-reactive protein concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes [^7a0564e6]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This study shows that among patients with type 2 diabetes, there is a greater reduction of hsCRP with atorvastatin compared with equivalent doses of simvastatin, even though their lipid profiles were similar. The variability of hsCRP was also less with atorvastatin compared with simvastatin.

The best clinical outcomes for patients on statin treatment seem to occur when there is a reduction in hsCRP in addition to the reduction of LDL. It is therefore hypothesized that among very-high-risk patients undergoing statin therapy, the dual goals of LDL and hsCRP reduction should be considered a new clinical target for therapy. From the current study findings, it seems that patients are more likely to attain these two goals if they are treated with atorvastatin rather than simvastatin.

One of the features of hsCRP measurement that complicates interpretation of results is its wide intra-individual variability. Our data have shown that patients taking atorvastatin not only had lower hsCRP concentrations, but had markedly less biological variability than when taking equivalent doses of simvastatin. A single value on atorvastatin treatment is therefore more likely to reflect the true hsCRP concentration of the patient. However, the potential clinical benefits of this reduced variability are less clear than that of purely lowering average hsCRP values.

Looking for existing evidence that atorvastatin leads to fewer cardiovascular events than simvastatin at the same degree of LDL lowering is hampered by the fact that most clinical trials involving the two agents have deliberately aimed to show a difference in LDL. Nonetheless, in these comparative studies, event rates have been more favorable with atorvastatin in both randomized controlled studies and observational studies.

There was a significant deterioration of median hsCRP and its variability when patients on atorvastatin were changed over to simvastatin. On the other hand, median hsCRP and its variability improved when patients on simvastatin were changed over to atorvastatin. The difference in variability of hsCRP and direct LDL could be due to the difference in stability of lipids while taking a relatively short half-life statin such as simvastatin (2–3 h) compared with that of a longer half-life statin such as atorvastatin (24 h). These changes may need to be taken into account when considering switching patients between the two statins on any grounds.

In conclusion, an equivalent lipid-lowering dose of atorvastatin improves hsCRP as well as reduces the variability compared with simvastatin in type 2 diabetic patients.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin (Vytorin) [^1e9d1ebf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In a multicenter, double-blind, controlled, 23-week trial, 710 patients with known CHD or CHD risk equivalents, as defined by the NCEP ATP III guidelines, and an LDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL were randomized to one of four treatment groups: coadministered ezetimibe and simvastatin equivalent to VYTORIN (10/10, 10/20, and 10/40) or simvastatin 20 mg. Patients not reaching an LDL-C < 100 mg/dL had their simvastatin dose titrated at 6-week intervals to a maximal dose of 80 mg. At Week 5, the LDL-C reductions with VYTORIN 10/10, 10/20, or 10/40 were significantly larger than with simvastatin 20 mg (see Table 9).

In a multicenter, double-blind, 6-week trial, 1902 patients with primary hyperlipidemia were randomized to one of eight treatment groups: VYTORIN (10/10, 10/20, 10/40, or 10/80) or atorvastatin (10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, or 80 mg).

Across the dosage range, when patients receiving VYTORIN were compared to those receiving milligram-equivalent statin doses of atorvastatin, VYTORIN lowered total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and non-HDL-C significantly more than atorvastatin. Only the 10/40 mg and 10/80 mg VYTORIN doses increased HDL-C significantly more than the corresponding milligram-equivalent statin dose of atorvastatin. The effects of VYTORIN on TG were similar to the effects seen with atorvastatin. (See Table 10 .)

Percent of individuals who reached (A) the 20th percentile target levels for‐C,‐P, and non–‐C or (B) the 5th percentile target levels based on the Multi‐Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis cohort. Baseline corresponds to either simvastatin 20 mg or atorvastatin 10 mg. 2× statin indicates doubling the statin dose to simvastatin 40 mg or atorvastatin 20 mg; E/S, ezetimibe/simvastatin;‐C, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol;‐P, low‐density lipoprotein particle number; non–‐C, non–high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol R, rosuvastatin.

For the more‐stringent targets, equivalent to the 5th percentile based on the MESA cohort 25, 38 (LDL‐C < 1.8 mmol/L, 70 mg/dL, and non–HDL‐C < 2.3 mmol/L, 90 mg/dL), the improvements in LDL‐C and non–HDL‐C were consistently greater for E/S 10/20 and R10 than those for doubling the statin dose (Figure 7 B). With low‐dose starting statin, either simvastatin (20 mg/day) or atorvastatin (10 mg/day), the percentage of patients achieving this LDL‐C target was less than 0.6%. With more‐intensive therapy, the percentage of individuals reaching the LDL‐C target level improved with doubling the statin dose, R10 and ES 10/20 (24.3%, 42.4%, and 52.6%, respectively). Similarly, the percentage of patients reaching the target level for non–HDL‐C increased substantially from 1.7% at the initial starting dose to 17.6%, 29.8%, and 41.4% with 2×statin, R10, and ES10/20, respectively. The percentage of individuals achieving the target level for LDL‐P (770 nmol/L) also improved from 11.2% at the starting dose to 18.9%, 25.8%, and 27.1%, with 2× statin, R10, and ES 10/20, respectively.

### Achievement of 2011 European low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals of either [^0f4b65de]. Atherosclerosis (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Guidelines published in 2011 by the European Atherosclerosis Society and the European Society of Cardiology recommend a goal of either low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) < 70 mg/dl (~1.8 mmol/l) or ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C for patients at very high cardiovascular risk. The aim of this study was to determine the percentage of high-risk patients from the VOYAGER individual patient data meta-analysis treated with rosuvastatin 10–40 mg, atorvastatin 10–80 mg or simvastatin 10–80 mg who achieved this goal.

Methods

We analysed 25,075 patient exposures from high-risk patients. Paired comparisons were made between each rosuvastatin dose and an equal or higher dose of either atorvastatin or simvastatin, with a series of meta-analyses that included only randomised studies that directly compared rosuvastatin and its comparator treatments.

Results

As statin dose increased, higher percentages of patients achieved LDL-C < 70 mg/dl or ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction. A greater percentage achieved this goal with rosuvastatin 10–40 mg (43.8–79.0%) than with equal or double milligram doses of atorvastatin (16.1–65.2%) or simvastatin (0–39.7%). Paired comparisons showed statistically significant differences for: rosuvastatin 10 mg vs. atorvastatin 10–20 mg and simvastatin 10–20 mg; rosuvastatin 20 mg vs. atorvastatin 20–40 mg and simvastatin 20–80 mg; and rosuvastatin 40 mg vs. atorvastatin 40–80 mg and simvastatin 40–80 mg (all p < 0.001).

Conclusion

These data from VOYAGER highlight the importance of an effective statin at an appropriate dose to achieve treatment goals for LDL-C in patients with very high cardiovascular risk.

### A 52-week, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, double-dummy study to assess the efficacy of atorvastatin and simvastatin in reaching low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride targets: the Treat-to-target (3T) study [^dc70161d]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines for the prevention of coronary heart disease call for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction as the primary target of treatment and reduction of triglycerides (TG) as an additional target.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of atorvastatin and simvastatin to reduce LDL-C and TG concentrations and to meet 3 target lipid levels: LDL-C ≤ 2.6 mmol/L; TG ≤ 1.5 mmol/L; and both LDL-C ≤ 2.6 mmol/L and TG ≤ 1.5 mmol/L.

Methods

The Treat-to-Target (3T) Study was a 52-week, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group study. Using the double-blind, double-dummy technique, adult patients aged 35 to 75 years with cardiovascular disease and dyslipidemia, defined as LDL-C concentration ≥ 4.0 mmol/L (≥ 155 mg/dL), were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive once-daily oral treatment with 20 mg atorvastatin or 20 mg simvastatin. Fasting (12-hour) blood samples for the estimation of lipid levels and clinical laboratory values were collected after 4, 8, 12, 26, and 52 weeks. The dose was doubled after 12 weeks if the target National Cholesterol Education Program level of LDL-C (≤ 2.6 mmol/L [100 mg/dL]) was not reached at 8 weeks.

Results

The intent-to-treat analysis included 552 patients (418 men, 134 women) randomized to receive atorvastatin and 535 (404 men, 131 women) randomized to receive simvastatin. The number of patients enrolled in the study allowed the evaluation fo the drugs' effects on TG. Patient demogrpahic characteristics were similar for the 2 treatment groups, and there were no differences in baseline lipid values. Compared with simvastatin, atorvastatin produced significantly greater reductions in LDL-C (8 weeks: -46% vs -40%, P < 0.001; 52 weeks: -49% vs -44%, P < 0.001) and in TG (8 weeks: -23% vs -14%, P < 0.001; 52 weeks: -24% vs -16%, P < 0.001). Compared with simvastatin-treated patients, a significantly greater number of atorvastatin-treated patients reached the LDL-C target after 8 weeks (45% vs 24%; P < 0.001). Fewer atorvastatin patients needed to have their dose doubled; nevertheless more atorvastatin patients reached the LDL-C target after 52 weeks (61% vs 41%; P < 0.001). Both statins were well tolerated. Muscular symptoms occurred in 12 patients (2.2%) in the atorvastatin group and in 13 patients (2.4%) in the simvastatin group.

Conclusions

Atorvastatin 20 or 40 mg/d for up to 1 year of treatment was significantly more effective than simvastatin 20 or 40 mg/d in reducing LDL-C and TG levels and at achieving recommended lipid targets in this selected patient population with cardiovascular disease and dyslipidemia. Both statis were well tolerated.

### Effects of low doses of simvastatin and atorvastatin on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia [^7861c8d6]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Simvastatin 40 to 80 mg/d has been found to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels significantly more than atorvastatin at equipotent doses (ie, 20–80 mg/d). Data on the effects of lower doses of the 2 drugs on HDL-C levels are conflicting.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of simvastatin 20 mg/d and atorvastatin 10 mg/d on HDL-C levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia.

Methods

Patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol [TC] > 250 mg/dL) who were not taking any lipid-lowering agents and who were following a low-fat diet were randomized to receive 1 of 2 treatments: simvastatin 20 mg/d or atorvastatin 10 mg/d. Serum TC, triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and HDL-C levels were measured using standard methods after 2 months of therapy. In a secondary analysis, lipids and lipoprotein cholesterol were measured after 1 year in patients who continued treatment.

Results

Of the 240 patients enrolled (108 men and 132 women; age range, 23–77 years, mean [SEM] 56.7 [0.69]), 235 completed the study. After 2 months of therapy, TC, LDL-C, and serum TG levels decreased significantly versus baseline in both groups (P < 0.001), with no significant differences between treatment groups. HDL-C levels increased by 9.0% (P < 0.001 vs baseline) in the simvastatin group and by 4.3% (P < 0.02) in the atorvastatin group. The difference between the 2 groups in the percentage increase in HDL-C was statistically significant (P < 0.05). In 113 patients who continued treatment, HDL-C levels at 1 year were still significantly higher than baseline levels in the simvastatin group (6.3%, P = 0.034), but not in the atorvastatin group (2.8%, P = 0.587).

Conclusions

The findings from this study suggest that the HDL-C-increasing effect of simvastatin 20 mg is significantly greater than that of atorvastatin 10 mg. Since increasing HDL-C levels is thought to lower the risk for atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease, these results warrant further investigation.

### High-dose atorvastatin vs usual-dose simvastatin for secondary prevention after myocardial infarction: the IDEAL study: a randomized controlled trial [^afa873a5]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Evidence suggests that more intensive lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) than is commonly applied clinically will provide further benefit in stable coronary artery disease.

Objective

To compare the effects of 2 strategies of lipid lowering on the risk of cardiovascular disease among patients with a previous myocardial infarction (MI).

Design, Setting, and Participants

The IDEAL study, a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end-point evaluation trial conducted at 190 ambulatory cardiology care and specialist practices in northern Europe between March 1999 and March 2005 with a median follow-up of 4.8 years, which enrolled 8888 patients aged 80 years or younger with a history of acute MI.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive a high dose of atorvastatin (80 mg/d; n = 4439), or usual-dose simvastatin (20 mg/d; n = 4449).

Main Outcome Measure

Occurrence of a major coronary event, defined as coronary death, confirmed nonfatal acute MI, or cardiac arrest with resuscitation.

Results

During treatment, mean LDL-C levels were 104 (SE, 0.3) mg/dL in the simvastatin group and 81 (SE, 0.3) mg/dL in the atorvastatin group. A major coronary event occurred in 463 simvastatin patients (10.4%) and in 411 atorvastatin patients (9.3%) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.89; 95% CI, 0.78–1.01; P = 0.07). Nonfatal acute MI occurred in 321 (7.2%) and 267 (6.0%) in the 2 groups (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71–0.98; P = 0.02), but no differences were seen in the 2 other components of the primary end point. Major cardiovascular events occurred in 608 and 533 in the 2 groups, respectively (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77–0.98; P = 0.02). Occurrence of any coronary event was reported in 1059 simvastatin and 898 atorvastatin patients (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.76–0.91; P < .001). Noncardiovascular death occurred in 156 (3.5%) and 143 (3.2%) in the 2 groups (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.73–1.15; P = 0.47). Death from any cause occurred in 374 (8.4%) in the simvastatin group and 366 (8.2%) in the atorvastatin group (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.85–1.13; P = 0.81). Patients in the atorvastatin group had higher rates of drug discontinuation due to nonserious adverse events; transaminase elevation resulted in 43 (1.0%) vs 5 (0.1%) withdrawals (P < .001). Serious myopathy and rhabdomyolysis were rare in both groups.

Conclusions

In this study of patients with previous MI, intensive lowering of LDL-C did not result in a significant reduction in the primary outcome of major coronary events, but did reduce the risk of other composite secondary end points and nonfatal acute MI. There were no differences in cardiovascular or all-cause mortality. Patients with MI may benefit from intensive lowering of LDL-C without an increase in noncardiovascular mortality or other serious adverse reactions.

### Use of lipid-lowering therapy after ischaemic stroke and expected benefit from intensification of treatment [^6a990eca]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study population

Home-dwelling patients from the multicentre, prospective Nor-COAST (Norwegian COgnitive Impairment After STroke) cohort study were included (n = 729), online supplemental figure S1. Patients admitted with ischaemic stroke at five Norwegian stroke units were consecutively included between May 2015 and March 2017. Patients were assessed with self-report questionnaires, clinical examinations and blood sampling after 3 and 18 months (online supplemental methods). We excluded patients who died within the first 3 months (n = 29), nursing home patients (n = 36) and patients lacking medication information (n = 3). Patients between 45 and 80 years (n = 462) were included as we used a risk prediction model derived and validated in this age range.

First (step 1) by adding/up-titrating to high intensity statin, and next (step 2) by adding ezetimibe. *Assuming already on maximally tolerated statin dose. Proportions are n of the total population (n = 427). Patients with no LLT, are patients who have discontinued prescribed LLT between discharge and 3 months. LDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; LLT, lipid-lowering therapy; HIS, high-intensity statin.

Use of LLT

LLT was identified using the following Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system codes: C10AA, C10AX and C10B. We used the Defined Daily Doses (DDDs)to convert to atorvastatin equivalent doses by the following formula: (Dose of statin/DDD for that statin)×DDD for atorvastatin = atorvastatin equivalent dose. High-intensity statins (HIS) was defined as ≥ 40 mg atorvastatin, ≥ 20 mg rosuvastatin or 80 mg simvastatin per day. We measured medication adherence by the 4-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-4), where a score of 4 points was defined as high adherence.

### Meta-analysis of comparative efficacy of increasing dose of atorvastatin versus rosuvastatin versus simvastatin on lowering levels of atherogenic lipids (from VOYAGER) [^e93acd3f]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Statins are the most commonly prescribed agents for lowering levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Although dose-dependent reductions in levels of atherogenic lipids are observed with all statins, the impact of increasing dose has not been fully elucidated. An individual patient data pooled analysis was performed of 32,258 patients in studies comparing the efficacy of rosuvastatin with that of atorvastatin or simvastatin. The impact of increasing dose on lowering LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B was investigated. Doubling the dose of each statin was accompanied by a 4% to 7% greater degree of lowering of all atherogenic lipids. A stronger correlation was observed between changes in LDL cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol (r = 0.92, p < 0.001) or apolipoprotein B (r = 0.76, p < 0.001) than triglycerides (r = 0.14, p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, baseline lipid level (p < 0.0001) and increasing statin dose (p < 0.0001) were strong predictors of achieving treatment goals in high-risk patients. Increasing age was a strong independent predictor of achieving goal for all atherogenic lipids (p < 0.0001). Achieving LDL cholesterol goals was also more likely in women (p < 0.0001), patients with diabetes (p < 0.0001), and patients without atherosclerotic disease (p = 0.0002). In contrast, normal triglyceride levels were more often observed in men (p < 0.0001) and patients without diabetes mellitus (p = 0.03). In conclusion, doubling statin dose was associated with greater lowering of LDL cholesterol by 4% to 6% and non-HDL cholesterol by 3% to 6%. Greater lipid goal achievement with increasing dose supports the use of high-dose statin therapy for more effective cardiovascular prevention.

Statin drug doses — moderate- and high-dose options are listed as follows: atorvastatin 10–20 mg (moderate) and 40–80 mg (high); rosuvastatin 5–10 mg (moderate) and 20–40 mg (high); simvastatin 20–40 mg (moderate; high-dose N/A); pravastatin 40–80 mg (moderate; high-dose N/A); lovastatin 40–80 mg (moderate; high-dose N/A); fluvastatin 80 mg (XL) or 40 mg BID (moderate; high-dose N/A); pitavastatin 1–4 mg (moderate; high-dose N/A). Statin doses listed as "moderate" are equivalent to moderate intensity; statin doses listed as "high" are equivalent to high intensity. In patients who are intolerant of statins: after washout (e.g., 1 month), re-challenge with same or a different statin or lower dose, and if that fails, a trial of intermittent (nondaily) dosing; intensified patient care (e.g., phone calls, emails, patient education, drug regimen simplification) may improve adherence to lipid-lowering medications.

Switching statins in SAMS — tolerability considerations note that "All seven FDA-approved statins are pharmacologically unique, with differences in biotransformation pathways, half-life, elimination routes, and lipophilicity (Table 7)". "Switching to a statin that is metabolized by a different enzyme system, avoids various transporters, or is less lipophilic may improve drug tolerability". Evidence cited includes that "fluvastatin and pravastatin are better tolerated as compared to atorvastatin and simvastatin17, but this may be related in part to their lower LDL-C lowering efficacy". The statement also highlights that "The low milligram amount with pitavastatin dosing (1, 2, or 4 mg) may be more psychologically appealing to patients who prefer the "lowest milligram strength".

### Comparison of effects of ezetimibe / simvastatin versus simvastatin versus atorvastatin in reducing C-reactive protein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels [^a971edef]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

The lowering effects of ezetimibe/simvastatin combination therapy on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) were compared with those of simvastatin or atorvastatin monotherapy in a large cohort of patients with primary hypercholesterolemia. To compare ezetimibe/simvastatin with simvastatin, data were combined from 3 identical, prospective 12-week trials in which patients were randomized to receive placebo; ezetimibe 10 mg; ezetimibe 10 mg added to simvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg; or simvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg. To compare ezetimibe/simvastatin with atorvastatin, data were analyzed from a phase III double-blind, active-controlled study in which patients were randomized equally to receive ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/10, 10/20, 10/40, or 10/80 mg or atorvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg for 6 weeks. When averaged across doses, ezetimibe/simvastatin produced significantly greater reductions compared with simvastatin alone in LDL cholesterol (52.5% vs 38.0%, respectively) and CRP levels (31.0% vs 14.3%, respectively). At each individual simvastatin dose, co-administration with ezetimibe produced significant further CRP reductions versus simvastatin alone. Ezetimibe/simvastatin was significantly more effective at lowering LDL cholesterol than atorvastatin when pooled across doses (53.4% vs 45.3%, respectively) and in each milligram-equivalent dose comparison. Reductions in CRP of similar magnitude were observed with ezetimibe/simvastatin and atorvastatin when averaged across doses and at each milligram-equivalent statin dose comparison. In conclusion, the lipid-modulating and anti-inflammatory effects of ezetimibe/simvastatin provide additional benefits not realized by statin monotherapy alone.

### Comparative efficacy study of atorvastatin vs simvastatin, pravastatin, lovastatin and placebo in type 2 diabetic patients with hypercholesterolaemia [^b979efbc]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2000). Low credibility.

Although there is little information from primary or secondary prevention trials on cholesterol-lowering medication in diabetic patients, the reduction of elevated cholesterol is widely recommended for this group. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends drug therapy in diabetic patients if low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol remains at > 130 mg/dl, or > 100 mg/dl in patients with macroangiopathy, after dietary intervention. When cholesterollowering medication is indicated, the choice of the drug must take into account the other lipid abnormalities that are often present and the need to maintain optimal glycaemic control. In the present study we compared the efficacy and safety of the novel HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor atorvastatin at the dose of 10 mg/day with simvastatin, lovastatin and pravastatin at doses of 10, 20 and 20 mg/day, respectively, and placebo, in type 2 diabetic patients with moderate elevation of LDL-cholesterol with or without elevation of triglycerides. All the quoted agents are enzyme inhibitors effective in lowering LDL-cholesterol in humans. The efficacy endpoints were the mean per cent changes in plasma LDL-cholesterol (primary), total cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol concentrations from baseline to the end of treatment (24 weeks). Atorvastatin at a dose of 10 mg/day produced: (1) a significant reduction in LDL-cholesterol (-37%) in comparison with equivalent doses of simvastatin (-26%), pravastatin (-23%), lovastatin (-21%), and placebo (-1%); (2) HDL-cholesterol increases (7.4%) comparable to or greater than those obtained with simvastatin (7.1%), pravastatin (3.2%), lovastatin (7.21%), and placebo (-0.5%); (3) a significantly greater reduction in total cholesterol (- 29%) than that obtained with simvastatin (-21%), pravastain (-16%), lovastatin (-18%), and placebo (1%); and (4) a significantly greater reduction in triglycerides than that obtained with all the other drugs and placebo. In all treatment groups no significant variation in fibrinogen concentration was observed. All reductase inhibitors studied had similar levels of tolerance. There were no incidents of persistent elevations of serum aminotransferases or myositis.

### Prediction of clinical irrelevance of PK differences in atorvastatin using PK / PD models derived from literature-based meta-analyses [^001db597]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

To support the development of a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of ezetimibe and atorvastatin for the treatment of dyslipidemia, bioequivalence (BE) studies were conducted across a combined dose range (10/10, 10/20, 10/40, and 10/80mg of ezetimibe/atorvastatin). In the BE trials, all parameters met traditional BE bounds except for atorvastatin peak plasma concentration (Cmax) at two intermediate doses. Literature-based metadata analysis predicted that the observed difference in Cmax between an ezetimibe+atorvastatin FDC and coadministration of these agents translates directly into a non-clinically significant change of < 1.2% absolute difference in the percentage lowering of low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol. Both FDC doses were confirmed to be clinically equivalent to coadministration in the subsequent clinical equivalence trials. These data suggest that modeling of dose-response relationships may be useful in predicting clinical equivalence, lowering cost/timelines through effective powering of studies, and predicting the effectiveness of new dosage formulations without the need for additional clinical efficacy trials in regulatory settings.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin (Vytorin) [^eeec8445]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In a multicenter, double-blind, 24-week, forced-titration trial, 788 patients with primary hyperlipidemia were randomized to receive coadministered ezetimibe and simvastatin equivalent to VYTORIN (10/10 and 10/20) or atorvastatin 10 mg. For all three treatment groups, the dose of the statin was titrated at 6-week intervals to 80 mg. At each pre-specified dose comparison, VYTORIN lowered LDL-C to a greater degree than atorvastatin (see Table 11).

In a multicenter, double-blind, 6-week trial, 2959 patients with primary hyperlipidemia, were randomized to one of six treatment groups: VYTORIN (10/20, 10/40, or 10/80) or rosuvastatin (10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg).

The effects of VYTORIN and rosuvastatin on total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, TG, non-HDL-C and HDL-C are shown in Table 12.

In a multicenter, double-blind, 24-week trial, 214 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with thiazolidinediones (rosiglitazone or pioglitazone) for a minimum of 3 months and simvastatin 20 mg for a minimum of 6 weeks were randomized to receive either simvastatin 40 mg or the coadministered active ingredients equivalent to VYTORIN 10/20. The median LDL-C and HbA1c levels at baseline were 89 mg/dL and 7.1%, respectively.

### Effects of switching statins on achievement of lipid goals: measuring effective reductions in cholesterol using rosuvastatin therapy (MERCURY I) study [^71c9d275]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

In a multinational trial (4522IL/0081), we assessed the effects of switching to low doses of rosuvastatin from commonly used doses of atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goal achievement in high-risk patients.

Methods

Hypercholesterolemic patients (n = 3140) with coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis, or type 2 diabetes were randomized to open-label rosuvastatin 10 mg, atorvastatin 10 or 20 mg, simvastatin 20 mg, or pravastatin 40 mg for 8 weeks. Patients either remained on these treatments for another 8 weeks or switched treatments from atorvastatin 10 mg, simvastatin 20 mg, and pravastatin 40 mg to rosuvastatin 10 mg or from atorvastatin 20 mg to rosuvastatin 10 or 20 mg. The primary efficacy measure was the proportion of patients reaching the Joint European Societies' LDL-C goal (< 116 mg/dL) at week 16. For measures of cholesterol goal achievement, treatment arms were compared using logistic-regression analysis.

Results

Significant improvement in LDL-C goal achievement was found for patients who switched to rosuvastatin 10 mg, compared with patients who remained on atorvastatin 10 mg (86% vs 80%, P < .05), simvastatin 20 mg (86% vs 72%, P < .0001), and pravastatin 40 mg (88% vs 66%, P < .0001), and between patients switched to rosuvastatin 20 mg and those who remained on atorvastatin 20 mg (90% vs 84%, P < .01). Similar results were found for achievement of the European combined LDL-C and total cholesterol goals and National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III LDL-C goals. All statins were well tolerated over 16 weeks.

Conclusions

We demonstrated that switching to a more efficacious statin is an effective strategy to improve lipid goal achievement in patients requiring lipid-lowering therapy.

### Statins research unfinished saga: desirability versus feasibility [^72b3cae8]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2005). Low credibility.

However, it should be pinpointed that lipid reduction, decrease of markers of hemostasis and inflammation or reduction in number of atherosclerotic plaques should be viewed as surrogate end points of statins activity. The extent to which these results can be extrapolated to clinically relevant outcomes remains to be established. It is yet unclear whether all statins are equally effective in preventing recurrent MI and death at a long-term follow-up. Drugs in the same class are generally thought to be therapeutically equivalent because of similar mechanisms of action (the so-called "class effect"). In this context, however, statins differ in multiple characteristics, including liver and renal metabolism, half-life, effects on several serum lipid components, bioavailability and potency. In addition, some are fungal derivatives, and others are synthetic compounds. The percentage absorption of an oral dose, amount of protein binding, degree of renal excretion, hydrophilicity, and potency on a weight basis varies among the individual agents. Despite these differences, a just published Canadian retrospective cohort study comparing atorvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin and fluvastatin in patients aged > 65 years after their first MI claims that all these statins are equally effective. The study included above 18500 patients who began statin treatment within 90 days after discharge, and the primary end point was the combined outcome of recurrent MI or death from any cause.

### The risk of muscular events among new users of hydrophilic and lipophilic statins: an observational cohort study [^4445c55b]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Statins are effective lipid-lowering drugs for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, but muscular adverse events can limit their use. Hydrophilic statins (pravastatin, rosuvastatin) may cause less muscular events than lipophilic statins (e.g. simvastatin, atorvastatin) due to lower passive diffusion into muscle cells.

Objective

To compare the risk of muscular events between statins at comparable lipid-lowering doses and to evaluate if hydrophilic statins are associated with a lower muscular risk than lipophilic statins.

Design/Setting

Propensity score-matched cohort study using data from the United Kingdom-based Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD.

Patients

New statin users. Cohort 1: pravastatin 20–40 mg (hydrophilic) vs simvastatin 10–20 mg (lipophilic), cohort 2: rosuvastatin 5–40 mg (hydrophilic) vs atorvastatin 10–80 mg (lipophilic), and cohort 3: simvastatin 40–80 mg vs atorvastatin 10–20 mg.

Main Measures

The outcome was a first record of a muscular event (myopathy, myalgia, myositis, rhabdomyolysis) during a maximum follow-up of 1 year.

Key Results

The propensity score-matched cohorts consisted of 1) 9,703, 2) 7,032, and 3) 37,743 pairs of statin users. Comparing the risk of muscular events between low-intensity pravastatin vs low-intensity simvastatin yielded a HR of 0.86 (95% CI 0.64–1.16). In the comparison of moderate- to high-intensity rosuvastatin vs equivalent doses of atorvastatin, we observed a HR of 1.17 (95% CI 0.88–1.56). Moderate- to high-intensity simvastatin was associated with a HR of 1.33 (95% CI 1.16–1.53), when compared with atorvastatin at equivalent doses.

Limitations

We could not conduct other pairwise comparisons of statins due to small sample size. In the absence of a uniform definition on the comparability of statin doses, the applied dose ratios may not fully match with all literature sources.

Conclusions

Our results do not suggest a systematically lower risk of muscular events for hydrophilic statins when compared to lipophilic statins at comparable lipid-lowering doses.

### The power of statins: aggressive lipid lowering [^def3fa67]. Clinical Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

A large body of evidence has demonstrated that reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) decrease the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and related adverse events. The greatest reductions in morbidity and mortality are attained in higher-risk patients, suggesting that targeting this group can maximize the cost-effectiveness of statins, since fewer patients need to be treated to prevent one event. High-risk individuals (those with preexisting CHD or CHD risk equivalents) require aggressive lipid lowering to achieve the stringent LDL-C goal levels established by the third report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP ATP III). The hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statins, have assumed the central role in this setting because of their superior ability to reduce LDL-C across the spectrum of CHD risk. Rosuvastatin, a new agent in this class, reduces LDL-C to a significantly greater degree than atorvastatin, pravastatin, or simvastatin. The more aggressive goals put forward since ATP I (1987) have heightened interest in more efficacious statins. As a result, simvastatin, atorvastatin, and now rosuvastatin have been developed, adding sequentially greater LDL-C-reducing capacity for the physician. Substantially more patients, particularly high-risk patients, are thereby able to achieve NCEP ATP III target LDL-C levels with rosuvastatin. Other cholesterol-lowering drugs (bile acid sequestrants, niacin, plant stanols, and fibrates) are much less effective at lowering LDL-C and are much less well tolerated but may be useful when combined with statins. A novel class of agents, cholesterol transport inhibitors, have recently become available. These and other new agents hold promise to help achieve ATP III goals when used in combination regimens initiated with a statin.

### Disparate effects of atorvastatin compared with simvastatin on C-reactive protein concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes [^c4a8ceaf]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

The ability of high sensitivity (hs) C-reactive protein (CRP) to predict cardiovascular risk has been confirmed in diverse population cohorts including type 2 diabetic patients. Patients who have lower hsCRP levels after statin therapy have better clinical outcomes regardless of the resultant level of LDL. Reduction in LDL and hsCRP are independent indicators of the success of statins in reducing cardiovascular risk. To assess any difference between the effect of long and short half-life statins on hsCRP and its variability, we conducted a crossover study with equivalent lipid-lowering doses of simvastatin and atorvastatin.

### Effect on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol of maximum dose simvastatin and atorvastatin in patients with hypercholesterolemia: results of the comparative HDL efficacy and safety study (CHESS) [^1baa6cc8]. American Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Previous studies have shown that effects on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) may differ among statins.

Methods

A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-dose study was conducted in 917 hypercholesterolemic patients to compare the efficacy of 80 mg/d simvastatin versus 80 mg/d atorvastatin on HDL-C and apolipoprotein (apo) A-I for 24 weeks. Efficacy was assessed as the means of weeks 6 and 12 and weeks 18 and 24. Prespecified subgroups analyzed were patients with low HDL-C levels and with the metabolic syndrome.

Results

Simvastatin increased HDL-C and apo A-I values significantly more than did atorvastatin for the mean of weeks 6 and 12 (8.9% vs 3.6% and 4.9% vs -0.9%, respectively) and the mean of weeks 18 and 24 (8.3% vs 4.2% and 3.7% vs -1.4%). These differences were observed across both baseline HDL-C subgroups (< 40 mg/dL, ≥ 40 mg/dL) and in patients with the metabolic syndrome. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride reductions were greater with atorvastatin. Consecutive elevations > 3x the upper limit of normal in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) occurred in significantly fewer patients treated with simvastatin than with atorvastatin (2/453 [0.4%] vs 13/464 [2.8%]), with most elevations observed in women taking atorvastatin (11/209 [5.3%] vs 1/199 [0.5%] for simvastatin).

Conclusions

Simvastatin (80 mg) increased HDL-C and apo A-I significantly more than did atorvastatin (80 mg) in patients with hypercholesterolemia. This advantage was observed regardless of HDL-C level at baseline or the presence of the metabolic syndrome. Significantly fewer consecutive elevations > 3x the upper limit of normal in ALT and/or AST occurred in patients receiving simvastatin.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^b2a03459]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Primary Hyperlipidemia

Ezetimibe and Simvastatin Tablets

Ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets reduce total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, TG, and non-HDL-C, and increases HDL-C in patients with hyperlipidemia. Maximal to near maximal response is generally achieved within 2 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy.

Ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets are effective in men and women with hyperlipidemia. Experience in non-Caucasians is limited and does not permit a precise estimate of the magnitude of the effects of ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets.

Five multicenter, double-blind studies conducted with either ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets or coadministered ezetimibe and simvastatin equivalent to ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets in patients with primary hyperlipidemia are reported: two were comparisons with simvastatin, two were comparisons with atorvastatin, and one was a comparison with rosuvastatin.

In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12 week trial, 1,528 hyperlipidemic patients were randomized to one of ten treatment groups: placebo, ezetimibe (10 mg), simvastatin (10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, or 80 mg), or ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets (10 mg/10 mg, 10 mg/20 mg, 10 mg/40 mg, or 10 mg/80 mg).

### Individualized dose-response to statins associated with cardiovascular disease outcomes [^f06e6157]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Our findings also indicate that the role of ED 50 warrants further consideration. Lower ED 50 (greater potency) means that a lower dose is needed to reach target LDL-C, and the use of a lower dose may place patients at a lower risk of muscle side effects. Hence, the more potent drugs may be better tolerated and lead to improved adherence for this important class of drugs. Clearly, potency influences prescribing patterns. At present, the 3 most commonly prescribed drugs in this class are simvastatin (approved in 1991), atorvastatin (approved in 1996), and rosuvastatin (approved in 2003). Currently, atorvastatin is prescribed more commonly than any other statin. Historically, when simvastatin came off patent (affordable generic formulation) in 2006, it became the most commonly prescribed statin for a decade but was displaced by the more potent atorvastatin in 2011 when it came off patent. Since rosuvastatin is even more potent than atorvastatin, the prescribing frequency for rosuvastatin is increasing following it becoming available as a generic formulation in 2016, and it may soon overtake atorvastatin as the most commonly prescribed drug within this class.

For rosuvastatin, we specifically observed that it had both the greatest potency (lowest ED 50) and the greatest efficacy (highest E max) when compared to atorvastatin or simvastatin. These findings are consistent with previously published results from randomized clinical trials comparing statin potency and efficacy. Furthermore, the overall variance in efficacy and potency was much tighter with rosuvastatin, suggesting that it uniquely has a more consistent lipid-lowering effect at more consistent doses. These features may represent driving factors that contribute to the ongoing increase in prescribing frequency for rosuvastatin in the prevention of ASCVD. Given the relatively recent uptake in rosuvastatin prescribing, the sample size for the rosuvastatin cohort in our study is less than that of atorvastatin or simvastatin. The potential implications of these findings highlight a need for multi-institutional studies to further characterize dose-response characteristics of rosuvastatin.

Representative high-intensity doses include Atorvastatin (40 mg†) 80 mg and Rosuvastatin 20 mg (40 mg). Moderate-intensity options include Atorvastatin 10 mg (20 mg), Rosuvastatin (5 mg) 10 mg, Simvastatin 20–40 mg§, Pravastatin 40 mg (80 mg), Lovastatin 40 mg (80 mg), Fluvastatin XL 80 mg, Fluvastatin 40 mg BID, and Pitavastatin 1–4 mg; a low-intensity example is Fluvastatin 20–40 mg. Boldface type indicates statins and doses evaluated in randomized controlled trials that demonstrated a reduction in major cardiovascular events. Although simvastatin 80 mg was evaluated, initiation of simvastatin 80 mg or titration to 80 mg is not recommended by the FDA because of the increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis. Percent reductions are estimates from large populations and individual responses vary in clinical practice.

### Safety and efficacy of ezetimibe / simvastatin combination versus atorvastatin alone in adults ≥ 65 years of age with hypercholesterolemia and with or at moderately high / high risk for coronary heart disease (the VYTELD study) [^a6f1bfa9]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Higher than 80% of coronary heart disease-related mortality occurs in patients ≥ 65 years of age. Guidelines recommend low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol targets for these at-risk patients; however, few clinical studies have evaluated lipid-lowering strategies specifically in older adults. This multicenter, 12-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of the usual starting dose of ezetimibe/simvastatin (10/20 mg) versus atorvastatin 10 or 20 mg and the next higher dose of ezetimibe/simvastatin (10/40 mg) versus atorvastatin 40 mg in 1,289 hypercholesterolemic patients ≥ 65 years of age with or without cardiovascular disease. Patients randomized to ezetimibe/simvastatin had greater percent decreases in LDL cholesterol (-54.2% for 10/20 mg vs -39.5% and -46.6% for atorvastatin 10 and 20 mg, respectively; -59.1% for 10/40 mg vs -50.8% for atorvastatin 40 mg; p < 0.001 for all comparisons) and the number attaining LDL cholesterol < 70 mg/dl (51.3% for 10/20 mg, 68.2% for 10/40 mg) and < 100 mg/dl (83.6% for 10/20 mg; 90.3% for 10/40 mg) was significantly larger compared to those receiving atorvastatin for all prespecified dose comparisons (p < 0.05 to < 0.001). A significantly larger percentage of high-risk patients achieved LDL cholesterol < 70 mg/dl on ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/20 mg (54.3%) versus atorvastatin 10 mg (10.9%, p < 0.001) or 20 mg (28.9%, p < 0.001) and ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/40 mg (69.2%) versus atorvastatin 40 mg (38.2%, p < 0.001), and a significantly larger percentage of intermediate-risk patients achieved LDL cholesterol < 100 mg/dl on ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/20 mg (82.1%) versus atorvastatin 10 mg (59.3%, p < 0.05). Improvements in non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and lipoprotein ratios were significantly greater with ezetimibe/simvastatin than atorvastatin for all comparisons (p < 0.01 to < 0.001). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride results were variable. All treatments were generally well tolerated. In conclusion, ezetimibe/simvastatin provided significantly greater improvements in key lipid parameters and higher attainment of LDL cholesterol targets than atorvastatin, with comparable tolerability.

### Ezetimibe + simvastatin versus doubling the dose of simvastatin in high cardiovascular risk diabetics: a multicenter, randomized trial (the LEAD study) [^0d1a2a11]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Coronary heart disease (CHD) prevention through management of modifiable risk factors is of great importance. The International Task Force, working in cooperation with the International Atherosclerosis Society, identified patients with diabetes mellitus as very high risk for CHD, and the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP ATP) III classified diabetes mellitus as a CHD risk equivalent. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been shown to be associated with increased risk for CHD, which is the major cause of mortality in patients with T2DM.

The consensus conference report from the American Diabetes Association and American College of Cardiology Foundation suggests 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) as initial therapy for management of lipoprotein abnormalities in patients with cardiometabolic risk, including T2DM. The recommended low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) treatment target for patients with T2DM is < 2.6 mmol/L (< 100 mg/dL), with < 1.8 mmol/L (< 70 mg/dL) as an optional therapeutic target in the US for patients with T2DM and CHD; and in Europe, the targets are similar: < 2.5 mmol/L (< 97 mg/dL) with an optional goal of < 2.0 mmol/L (< 77 mg/dL). A recent meta-analysis of 14 randomized trials with statins in primary and secondary prevention in diabetes demonstrated the substantial benefit of statins in reducing major cardiovascular events independent of pre-treatment concentration of LDL-C and similar to that observed in non-diabetic subjects. Despite evidence for the benefit of statin treatment, a considerable number of European patients are not treated with lipid-lowering drugs, and specifically, statins are appreciably underused in diabetic patients in Italy. In patients receiving treatment, a moderate dose of statin may not be sufficient to reach recommended LDL-C targets. Significant LDL-C reductions have been observed with more intensive therapy using higher doses of statins, but not all patients tolerate high-dose statins. For some patients, the incidence of abnormalities in liver function or myopathy may increase in a dose-dependant manner with this class of drugs; and even with a high dose, some patients still do not meet treatment goals. Irrespective of dose, another important aspect in determining the response to lipid-lowering drugs is the balance between cholesterol synthesis and absorption. Inter-individual variability of response has been demonstrated both with statins, which reduce cholesterol synthesis in the liver, and with ezetimibe, which selectively blocks intestinal absorption of cholesterol by binding the Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) receptor. By targeting both mechanisms a greater reduction in LDL-C may be achieved. Statin therapy combined with ezetimibe may provide effects on lipids that complement and surpass those of high-dose statins.

### Comparing HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors [^1ca8aaab]. Clinical Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

The statins have proved to be some of the most potent therapies for reducing elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and lessening the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and related events. Nonetheless, there are still questions about the clinical relevance of individual drug characteristics, such as chemical derivation, solubility properties, and metabolic route, in terms of tolerability or therapeutic benefit. At the same time, no clear explanation has emerged for the significantly steeper reductions in LDL cholesterol levels achieved with atorvastatin versus lovastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, or fluvastatin, or, more recently, with rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin, although possible mechanisms have been suggested. More studies are needed to characterize the effects of statins on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in different patient groups. Clearly, though, several statins have yielded significant reductions in CHD risk and have shown to be well tolerated in both primary and secondary prevention trials. The possibility that statins exert pronounced effects beyond lowering blood lipids is opening other avenues of research into the benefits of these drugs.

### Atorvastatin calcium, film coated (atorvastatin calcium) [^f1a833c7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Primary Hyperlipidemia in Adults

Atorvastatin reduces total-C, LDL-C, apo B, and TG, and increases HDL-C in patients with hyperlipidemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia. Therapeutic response is seen within 2 weeks, and maximum response is usually achieved within 4 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy.

In two multicenter, placebo-controlled, dose-response trials in patients with hyperlipidemia, atorvastatin given as a single dose over 6 weeks, significantly reduced total-C, LDL-C, apo B, and TG. (Pooled results are provided in Table 8.)

Table 8: Dose Response in Patients with Primary Hyperlipidemia (Adjusted Mean % Change From Baseline)

In three multicenter, double-blind trials in patients with hyperlipidemia, atorvastatin was compared to other statins. After randomization, patients were treated for 16 weeks with either atorvastatin 10 mg per day or a fixed dose of the comparative agent (Table 9).

Table 9: Mean Percentage Change From Baseline at Endpoint (Double-Blind, Randomized, Active-Controlled Trials)

### Prediction of clinical irrelevance of PK differences in atorvastatin using PK / PD models derived from literature-based meta-analyses [^a6ddf600]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Calculation of the sample size for CE trials. The original sample size of 406 patients was chosen to provide 95% power in order to establish that ezetimibe+atorvastatin combination and ezetimibe+atorvastatin coadministration are equivalent. The sample size calculation was based on equivalence margins of ± 4%, assumed true difference of 1.5%, SD of within-patient difference of 12.8%, and 85% evaluability rate using two one-sided tests, each at a 2.5% significance level. The assumption of the true difference of 1.5% was based on the effective dose of atorvastatin calculated using a dose proportionality assumption at the 10/20-mg dose for both AUC and C max. The dose was input into the model proposed by Mandema et al.which gave a prediction of ~1.5% difference. Based on the initial predicted distribution of difference based on the dose proportionality assumption, the sample size of 406 patients translates to an ~80% probability of success.

The updated sample size incorporated the predictions from the updated dose–response model that accounted for the greater-than-dose-proportional increase in exposure. The gain in precision from the more elaborate modeling exercise resulted in a distinct and more accurate predicted distribution of differences between FDC and coadministration of its components for both the 10/20- and the 10/40-mg doses. This higher precision led to a reduced sample size, an overall savings of 17% across the two CE studies, and a higher probability of success (90% for each study).

### Lack of therapeutic interchangeability of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors [^28ebbad1]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To review relevant literature and provide an opinion on the class effect of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins).

Data Sources

Primary and review articles were identified by MEDLINE search (1990-July 2002).

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Editorials, studies, and review articles related to the class effect or therapeutic interchangeability of statins were reviewed. Also included was information that is relevant to this topic.

Data Synthesis

Although statins share common main actions, they may have clinically important differences in terms of efficacy and safety. At fixed or allowable dosages, rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, and simvastatin produced greater low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering effects compared with other statins. Some statins have shown reduction in either cardiovascular and/or total mortality. Statins also differ in their structure, pharmacokinetics, potency, and rate of metabolism, any or all of which may have clinical significance. Although inconclusive, subtle differences in nonlipid effects of some statins may have contributed to positive benefits observed in clinical studies. As a result of drug-related deaths, cerivastatin was withdrawn voluntarily from the market, which may raise the question whether there is therapeutic interchangeability (due to class effect) among statins.

Conclusions

Despite the competition for market share and strategies attempting to identify differences in therapeutic value, few head-to-head comparisons between statins have been performed. The limited, available data suggest that statins are not therapeutically interchangeable.

### Is statin-induced diabetes clinically relevant? A comprehensive review of the literature [^54f6d988]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

In those predisposed to the development of diabetes (the insulin resistant, obese and older patients) statins may increase the risk of developing diabetes. Despite the fact that the conversion to diabetes is generated from post hoc analyses, it seems to be a class effect with a dose-response relationship. However, statins have not been clearly shown to increase diabetic microvascular complications (retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy). Thus, the clinical significance of increased glucose levels in patients treated on statins is uncertain. While the exact mechanism for how statins increase the risk of diabetes is unknown, a possible explanation is through a reduction in adiponectin levels. Despite the fact that higher statin doses are more likely to lead to new-onset diabetes, for every case of diabetes caused, there are approximately three cardiovascular events reduced with high dose versus moderate dose statin therapy. Overall, the small risk of developing type 2 diabetes with statin therapy is far outweighed by the potential of statins to decrease cardiac events.

### Comparison of efficacy and safety of atorvastatin and simvastatin in patients with dyslipidemia with and without coronary heart disease [^f3c288be]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

The efficacy and safety of atorvastatin 10 mg versus simvastatin 20 mg and atorvastatin 80 mg versus simvastatin 80 mg was determined in a 6-week, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end-point trial of dyslipidemic patients with and without coronary heart disease. A total of 1,732 patients with hypercholesterolemia and triglycerides ≤ 600 mg/dl (6.8 mmol/L) were randomized to receive either atorvastatin 10 mg (n = 650), simvastatin 20 mg (n = 650), atorvastatin 80 mg (n = 216), or simvastatin 80 mg (n = 216). The primary efficacy parameter was the change in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol from baseline to week 6. Secondary efficacy parameters included the percent change from baseline to week 6 in total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and the percent of patients achieving their National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) LDL cholesterol goal at study end. Atorvastatin had significantly greater reductions from baseline in LDL cholesterol than simvastatin in both comparator groups: atorvastatin 10 mg (37.1%) versus simvastatin 20 mg (35.4%) (p = 0.0097), and atorvastatin 80 mg (53.4%) versus simvastatin 80 mg (46.7%) (p < 0.0001). Atorvastatin 10 and 80 mg also provided significantly greater reductions in total cholesterol, triglycerides, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B than simvastatin 20 and 80 mg, respectively (all p < 0.05). All treatment groups had a significantly decreased LDL cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio from baseline (all p < 0.0001). In both comparator groups a higher proportion of atorvastatin-treated patients reached their NCEP LDL cholesterol goal compared with simvastatin. All 4 study treatments were well tolerated.

### Statins do not meet expectations for lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels when used in clinical practice [^a7e4b39e]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Statins have become a mainstay in the treatment of hyperlipidemia, based on their potency and favorable side-effect profile. Drug choice is presumed to be guided by the estimated degree of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowering required in a particular patient and the projected efficacy of any drug-dose combination, as contained in the package inserts for each medication. We investigated whether these expectations were met in a clinical practice.

Methods

Data were analyzed for 367 hyperlipidemic patients in a preventive cardiology practice who were not taking statins at entry, who were given a standard statin dose at their first visit, and who had at least one follow-up visit on the same drug/dose. Expected LDL cholesterol reductions were calculated for each patient based on guidelines in the package inserts for each drug.

Results

The mean (± SD) observed LDL cholesterol reduction of 26% ± 20% was significantly less than expected (34% ± 7%, P < 0.001). The ratio of observed to expected reduction was not different for the three statins used (atorvastatin, 0.79 ± 0.48; simvastatin, 0.88 ± 0.61; pravastatin, 0.75 ± 0.69; P = 0.39).

Conclusions

The use of statins in a clinical practice led to observed reductions in LDL cholesterol level that were significantly less than those projected by package insert guidelines. We believe this gap reflects the reduced patient compliance frequently observed in clinical practice settings, rather than any inherent difference in statin responsiveness of a practice versus a trial population. Physicians should be aware of this disparity when using statins in the clinical setting.

### Benefit-risk assessment of rosuvastatin 10 to 40 milligrams [^5ce0117e]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

The aim of this article is to examine the benefit-risk profile of rosuvastatin at doses of 10 to 40 mg. In dyslipidemic patients, rosuvastatin produced markedly greater reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and equivalent or greater improvements in various lipid measures, including high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides when compared with atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin. In addition, rosuvastatin is more effective than these statins in allowing patients to reach National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III and Joint European Societies LDL cholesterol goals. The safety profile of rosuvastatin was reviewed (as of April 2003) in 12,569 patients, representing 14,231 patient-years of treatment at doses up to 80 mg. In controlled trials, rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg demonstrated a similar adverse event profile to those for atorvastatin 10 to 80 mg, simvastatin 10 to 80 mg, and pravastatin 10 to 40 mg. Myopathy (defined as muscle symptoms plus serum creatine kinase levels > 10 times the upper limit of normal) attributed to rosuvastatin occurred in ≤ 0.03% of patients receiving rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg. No cases of rhabdomyolysis occurred in patients receiving rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg. Clinically significant alanine aminotransferase elevations occurred in 0.2% of patients receiving rosuvastatin and those receiving atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin. Compared with other widely used statins, the benefit-risk profile of rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg appears to be very favorable.

### Comparison of once-daily, niacin extended-release / lovastatin with standard doses of atorvastatin and simvastatin (the ADvicor versus other cholesterol-modulating agents trial evaluation [ADVOCATE]) [^202d429c]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

This study compared the relative efficacy of a once-daily niacin extended-release (ER)/lovastatin fixed-dose combination with standard doses of atorvastatin or simvastatin, with a special emphasis on relative starting doses. Subjects (n = 315) with elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol blood levels (defined as LDL cholesterol blood levels ≥ 160 mg/dl without coronary artery disease, or ≥ 130 mg/dl if coronary artery disease was present, and HDL cholesterol < 45 mg/dl in men and < 50 mg/dl in women) were randomized to atorvastatin, simvastatin, or niacin ER/lovastatin for 16 weeks. The primary efficacy variables were the mean percent change in LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol levels from baseline. After 8 weeks, the starting dose niacin ER/lovastatin 1,000/40 mg and the 10-mg starting dose atorvastatin both lowered mean LDL cholesterol by 38%. After 12 weeks, niacin ER/lovastatin 1,000/40 mg lowered LDL cholesterol by 42% versus 34% with the 20-mg starting dose of simvastatin (p < 0.001). Niacin ER/lovastatin increased HDL cholesterol significantly more than atorvastatin or simvastatin at all compared doses (p < 0.001). Niacin ER/lovastatin also provided significant improvements in triglycerides, lipoprotein(a), apolipoprotein A-1, apolipoprotein B, and HDL subfractions. A total of 6% of study subjects receiving niacin ER/lovastatin withdrew because of flushing. No significant differences were seen among study groups in discontinuance due to elevated liver enzymes. No drug-induced myopathy was observed. Niacin ER/lovastatin was comparable to atorvastatin 10 mg and more effective than simvastatin 20 mg in reducing LDL cholesterol, was more effective in increasing HDL cholesterol than either atorvastatin or simvastatin, and provided greater global improvements in non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and lipoprotein(a).

### Lipid goal attainment in post-acute coronary syndrome patients in China: results from the 6-month real-world dyslipidemia international study II [^64a06e5a]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

DYSIS II‐China was a multicenter prospective observational study conducted between September 2017 and May 2019 at 28 cardiology departments of tertiary hospitals. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of each hospital according to the local regulations and the study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Each patient provided written informed consent for participation before enrolment. The study included patients hospitalized for an ACS, with the availability of full lipid profile results performed within 24 hours of hospital admission, and were either on LLT ≥ 3 months (defined as LLT group: prescribed with statins: atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin, pitavastatin and/or nonstatin lipid lowing agents ezetimibe, fibrates, nicotinic acids, laropiprant, omega3) or 'LLT‐naive or off LLT for ≥ 3 months' (defined as non‐LLT group). An atorvastatin‐equivalent dose of other statins was estimated by assuming their equivalent dose for each dose level of atorvastatin. Patients with any cognitive impairment at discharge were excluded. 6‐month follow‐up visits were conducted when patients visited hospitals for their routine clinical care at around Day 180 ± 30 of enrolment. The sample size was calculated to be 96 patients with an assumption of a lower one‐sided precision at 6% for an estimated LDL‐C goal attainment rate of 21% in the smallest subgroup of 'nonstatin users' of the study population at a 6‐month follow‐up. Considering approximately 10% of patients to be 'nonstatin users' in the total study population and a dropout rate of 15%, the sample size for the overall study was calculated to be 1130.

### Effect of switching from statin monotherapy to ezetimibe / simvastatin combination therapy compared with other intensified lipid-lowering strategies on lipoprotein subclasses in diabetic patients with symptomatic cardiovascular disease [^bdb78273]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

The lipid changes observed in this subgroup analysis were generally similar to those reported in the full cohort of the original trial, in which switching to ES combination therapy improved LDL‐C lowering and achievement of LDL‐C levels < 70 and < 100 mg/dL compared with doubling the baseline statin dose and switching to R10. 33 Other studies have also reported that switching from low‐dose statin monotherapy to ES combination therapy significantly improved LDL‐C lowering compared with doubling the statin dose 39, 40, 41 and switching to R10. 42, 43 Taken together, these results indicate that more‐intensive lipid‐lowering therapy may contribute to improved lipid management in these high‐risk patients.

Given that measurement of on‐treatment levels of LDL‐P may be more predictive of residual CVD risk than LDL‐C when the 2 measures are discordant, it has been suggested that intensification of lipid‐lowering therapy is reasonable to consider when elevated LDL‐P is present in patients receiving statin therapy. 25, 44 To assess the response to lipid‐lowering therapy, LDL‐P targets have been proposed, based on population equivalent levels for LDL‐C targets (< 20th percentile for high‐ and very high‐risk patients). It should be noted that while treatment targets for LDL‐C, non–HDL‐C, and apoB have been recommended in various national dyslipidemia guidelines, LDL‐P targets have not been endorsed. 1, 7, 12, 15 Achievement of LDL‐P targets that are equivalent to LDL‐C and non–HDL‐C targets based on population percentiles have been shown to require intensive therapy. 44 Our study showed that ≤ 41% of patients at baseline had levels of LDL‐C < 2.33 mmol/L (90 mg/dL), non–HDL‐C < 2.85 mmol/L (110 mg/dL), and LDL‐P < 990 nmol/L after 6 weeks of pretreatment with S20 or A10. After switching to ES10/20 or R10, > 72% of patients achieved the LDL‐C level and > 57% achieved the LDL‐P and non–HDL‐C targets, highlighting the importance of more‐intensive therapy in reducing the atherogenic lipoprotein profile in these patients. The observation that more patients achieved the LDL‐C than LDL‐P and non–HDL‐C target levels may be attributed to a high LDL‐P number that is not reflected by LDL‐C measurement, consistent with findings in patients where these 2 measures are discordant. 44 To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate the effect of these therapies on LDL‐P targets.

### Lipid-lowering efficacy of atorvastatin [^4425dee1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

This represents the first update of this review, which was published in 2012. Atorvastatin is one of the most widely prescribed drugs and the most widely prescribed statin in the world. It is therefore important to know the dose-related magnitude of effect of atorvastatin on blood lipids.

Objectives

Primary objective To quantify the effects of various doses of atorvastatin on serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and triglycerides in individuals with and without evidence of cardiovascular disease. The primary focus of this review was determination of the mean per cent change from baseline of LDL-cholesterol. Secondary objectives
- To quantify the variability of effects of various doses of atorvastatin.• To quantify withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs) in placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 11, 2013), MEDLINE (1966 to December Week 2 2013), EMBASE (1980 to December Week 2 2013), Web of Science (1899 to December Week 2 2013) and BIOSIS Previews (1969 to December Week 2 2013). We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled and uncontrolled before-and-after trials evaluating the dose response of different fixed doses of atorvastatin on blood lipids over a duration of three to 12 weeks.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed eligibility criteria for studies to be included and extracted data. We collected information on withdrawals due to adverse effects from placebo-controlled trials.

Main Results

In this update, we found an additional 42 trials and added them to the original 254 studies. The update consists of 296 trials that evaluated dose-related efficacy of atorvastatin in 38,817 participants. Included are 242 before-and-after trials and 54 placebo-controlled RCTs. Log dose-response data from both trial designs revealed linear dose-related effects on blood total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. The Summary of findings table 1 documents the effect of atorvastatin on LDL-cholesterol over the dose range of 10 to 80 mg/d, which is the range for which this systematic review acquired the greatest quantity of data. Over this range, blood LDL-cholesterol is decreased by 37.1% to 51.7% (Summary of findings table 1). The slope of dose-related effects on cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol was similar for atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, but rosuvastatin is about three-fold more potent. Subgroup analyses suggested that the atorvastatin effect was greater in females than in males and was greater in non-familial than in familial hypercholesterolaemia. Risk of bias for the outcome of withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs) was high, but the mostly unclear risk of bias was judged unlikely to affect lipid measurements. Withdrawals due to adverse effects were not statistically significantly different between atorvastatin and placebo groups in these short-term trials (risk ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.68 to 1.40).

Authors' Conclusions

This update resulted in no change to the main conclusions of the review but significantly increases the strength of the evidence. Studies show that atorvastatin decreases blood total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol in a linear dose-related manner over the commonly prescribed dose range. New findings include that atorvastatin is more than three-fold less potent than rosuvastatin, and that the cholesterol-lowering effects of atorvastatin are greater in females than in males and greater in non-familial than in familial hypercholesterolaemia. This review update does not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with atorvastatin because included trials were of short duration and adverse effects were not reported in 37% of placebo-controlled trials.

Characteristics of clinical covariates and outcomes

Survival analysis was completed within a subset of the dose-response cohort, including 518 individuals for atorvastatin, 329 for simvastatin, and 300 for rosuvastatin. Event rates were as follows: 41.5% (215/518) for atorvastatin, 42.9% (141/329) for simvastatin, and 47.7% (143/300) for rosuvastatin (P < 0.05). Mean follow-up was 9.0 ± 6.3 years, 12.3 ± 5.7 years, and 6.1 ± 4.5 years for atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin, respectively. The distribution of demographic features, comorbidities, and other covariates (E 0, LDL reduction, observation duration) along with event rate are shown in Table 3. Prior ASCVD event rate was highest in the rosuvastatin cohort at 35.0%, compared to approximately 22.0% in atorvastatin and 22.5% in simvastatin cohorts. The age at the time of analysis for simvastatin users was higher than that of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin users.

### Disparate effects of atorvastatin compared with simvastatin on C-reactive protein concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes [^953b59a4]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

All subjects gave their informed consent, which had been approved by the Research Ethics Committee. A total of 30 consecutive Caucasian patients with type 2 diabetes and A1C between 6 and 9% were recruited. There were 19 patients taking 10 mg atorvastatin and 11 patients on 40 mg simvastatin before bed. The biological variation of hsCRP was assessed by measuring fasting blood samples at 4-day intervals on 10 consecutive occasions. Thereafter, the patients on simvastatin were changed to the equivalent dose of atorvastatin and vice versa. After 3 months, the biological variation was again assessed by measuring fasting blood samples at 4-day intervals on 10 consecutive occasions. Duplicate samples were randomized and then analyzed using a single batch. Serum CRP was measured by the high-sensitivity method on a Beckman DXC analyzer. The intra-assay CV was 4% using the study samples.

Statistical analysis

The distribution of hsCRP concentrations within and between individuals is non-Gaussian, so the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the median hsCRP values of individual patients taking simvastatin compared with atorvastatin. To compare the hsCRP variability while on the statins, each hsCRP measurement was log-transformed. Biological variability of CRP on each drug was analyzed by calculating the analytical and within-subject variability. The distribution of these standard deviation (SD I) values within the study population was non-Gaussian, so the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the individual SDs of patients when they were taking each statin.

### High-dose atorvastatin is superior to moderate-dose simvastatin in preventing peripheral arterial disease [^ecc9c28a]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To study whether high-dose versus usual-dose statin treatment reduces the incidence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) and what is the effect of high-dose statin treatment on cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcome in patients with PAD.

Methods and Results

In the Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering trial, 8888 post-myocardial infarction patients were randomised to high-dose or usual-dose statin therapy (atorvastatin 80mg/day vs simvastatin 20-40mg/day). We investigated the effect of high-dose versus usual-dose statins on the pre-specified outcome PAD incidence, and additionally performed a posthoc analysis of the efficacy of high-dose statins in reducing CVD risk among patients with PAD. During a median follow-up of 4.8years, 94 patients (2.2%) receiving atorvastatin and 135 patients (3.2%) receiving simvastatin developed PAD (HR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.91; p = 0.007). The risk of major coronary events was almost twofold higher in patients with PAD at baseline, but was no longer significant after adjusting for the adverse cardiovascular risk profile. In PAD patients, major coronary events occurred in fewer patients in the atorvastatin group (14.4%) than in the simvastatin group (20.1%), but the difference did not reach statistical significance. (HR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.11; p = 0.13). Atorvastatin treatment significantly reduced overall cardiovascular (p = 0.046) and coronary events (p = 0.004), and coronary revascularisation (p = 0.007) in these patients.

Conclusions

High-dose statin therapy with atorvastatin significantly reduced the incidence of PAD compared with usual-dose statin therapy with simvastatin. Patients with a history of PAD at baseline were at higher risk of future coronary events and this risk was reduced by high-dose atorvastatin treatment.

### Atorvaliq [^5bd4264e]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary Hyperlipidemia in Adults

Atorvastatin reduces total-C, LDL-C, apo B, and TG, and increases HDL-C in patients with hyperlipidemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia. Therapeutic response is seen within 2 weeks, and maximum response is usually achieved within 4 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy.

In two multicenter, placebo-controlled, dose-response trials in patients with hyperlipidemia, atorvastatin given as a single dose over 6 weeks, significantly reduced total-C, LDL-C, apo B, and TG. (Pooled results are provided in Table 8.)

In three multicenter, double-blind trials in patients with hyperlipidemia, atorvastatin was compared to other statins. After randomization, patients were treated for 16 weeks with either atorvastatin 10 mg per day or a fixed dose of the comparative agent (Table 9).

Table 9 does not contain data comparing the effects of atorvastatin 10 mg and higher doses of lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin. The drugs compared in the trials summarized in the table are not necessarily interchangeable.

Hypertriglyceridemia in Adults

The response to atorvastatin in 64 patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia treated across several clinical trials is shown in the table below (Table 10). For the atorvastatin-treated patients, median (min, max) baseline TG level was 565 (267–1502).

Results

Dose-response characteristics for 3 statins

A total of 3,033 unique individuals underwent dose-response modeling — 1,632 in the atorvastatin cohort, 1,089 in the simvastatin cohort, and 312 in the rosuvastatin cohort — with age, race, gender, and statin characteristics of each cohort described in Table 1. Demographic features were similar between each cohort. Mean age in years was 65.4 ± 12.9 years, 69.5 ± 13.4 years, and 64.2 ± 12.0 years; % male was 59.9%, 51.2%, and 53.8%; and % White was 80.3%, 79.9%, and 83.3%, for atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin, respectively. Demographic characteristics are representative of the surrounding community.

Table 1
Dose-Response Cohort Demographics

Raw data and dose-response traits for atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin are shown in Figure 2, with summary statistics in Table 2. E 0 was similar across all 3 statin medications; mean E 0 (mg/dL) was 147.5 ± 23.1, 149.6 ± 22.5, and 153.6 ± 23.2 for atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin, respectively. ED 50 (mg) from greatest to least was rosuvastatin (3.6 ± 0.5), atorvastatin (11.1 ± 1.6), and then simvastatin (13.1 ± 2.0). One-way analysis of variance tests for mean potency between statins suggested that they differ by mean potency (P < 0.001). There was more similarity in E max (mg/dL) with results suggesting that the individuals' E max varies among statins. Rosuvastatin (84.6 ± 1.5) was the most effective at lowering LDL-C levels, followed by atorvastatin (80.9 ± 4.0) and simvastatin (79.8 ± 13.1).

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^aec55ff0]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) — statin dosing strategies to optimize tolerability include using a lower dose, switching to a different statin or biotransformation pathway, intermittent dosing with longer half-life statins, evidence-based selection, naturally derived options, choosing the lowest milligram strength, and temporary washout. Consider using the lowest daily dose which will provide the majority of the statin's low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering capacity; for example, a patient with SAMS on atorvastatin 80 mg daily may tolerate atorvastatin 10 mg daily. Intermittent dosing is reserved for more severe cases where patients cannot tolerate even the lowest daily dose, and utilizing statins with longer half-lives and greater potency (atorvastatin or rosuvastatin) is recommended in this context, such as rosuvastatin 5 mg given three times per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) for a patient with SAMS on atorvastatin 10–80 mg daily. Some patients may be more accepting of statins shown to have reduced rates of SAMS in clinical trials (e.g., consider fluvastatin-XL or pravastatin instead of simvastatin), may prefer a naturally derived statin (e.g., lovastatin is FDA-approved whereas red yeast rice is not), or may accept a drug with a lower milligram strength (e.g., pitavastatin 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg versus 10 to 80 mg for other statins). Some patients may benefit from a washout period or drug holiday, for example a patient taking rosuvastatin 20 mg daily who takes a 1–2 week drug holiday in preparation for a strenuous physical event, and holding the statin for a few days to a few weeks before restarting may improve persistence rates. Although the table emphasizes dosing strategies, optimizing dietary and lifestyle interventions is recommended for all patients.

### NLA scientific statement on statin intolerance: a new definition and key considerations for ASCVD risk reduction in the statin intolerant patient [^a53370ef]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Statin intolerance — definitions from select organizations describe criteria for inability to tolerate statins and assessment of statin-associated muscle symptoms. NLA Expert Panel on Statin Intolerance 2014 defines "the inability to tolerate at least two statins: one statin at the lowest starting daily dose and another statin at any daily dose", with adverse findings that are "temporally related to statin treatment and reversible upon statin discontinuation, but reproducible by rechallenge" after excluding other determinants; it specifies lowest starting doses as "rosuvastatin 5 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg, simvastatin 10 mg, lovastatin 20 mg, pravastatin 40 mg, fluvastatin 40 mg and pitavastatin 2 mg". A Unified Definition from an International Lipid Expert Panel requires "The inability to tolerate at least two different statins - one statin at the lowest starting average daily dose and the other statin at any dose" with confirmed adverse effects or biomarker abnormalities, improvement "upon dose decrease or discontinuation", and that changes are "not attributable to established predispositions such as drug-drug interactions and recognized conditions". The European Atherosclerosis Society statement notes assessment should "take account of the nature of the muscle symptoms, the elevation in CK levels and their temporal association with statin initiation, discontinuation, and re-challenge".

The dose range for rosuvastatin in Europe has recently been expanded to 5 to 40 mg and is now in line with the dose range currently available in the United States.

Objective

The goal of this article was to review the efficacy and safety data available for the rosuvastatin 5-mg dose and discuss these data in the context of the full 5- to 40-mg dose range.

Methods

Articles referring to clinical efficacy or safety data for the 5-mg dose of rosuvastatin were identified and reviewed after a search of the MEDLINE database (2000-August 2006; English language only) using the search term rosuvastatin. Proceedings from major cardiology congresses (2000–2006) were also searched for additional information.

Results

Rosuvastatin 5 mg is significantly (P < 0.001) more effective at reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol (42% and 30%) levels compared with atorvastatin 10 mg (36% and 27%), simvastatin 20 mg (36% and 25%), and pravastatin 20 mg (27% and 19%). Rosuvastatin 5 mg allows significantly more patients to reach their LDL-C goals as recommended by the 2003 European guidelines and the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III) (49%-52% and 67%-71%) than atorvastatin 10 mg (36%, P < 0.001; 53%, P < 0.01), simvastatin 20 mg (37%, P < 0.001; 64%, P < 0.05), and pravastatin 20 mg (12%, P < 0.001; 49%, P < 0.001). Rosuvastatin is well tolerated across the 5- to 40-mg dose range, with a type and incidence of adverse events similar to the other commonly available, but less effective, statins. The introduction of a 5-mg dose offers greater flexibility to prescribing physicians in that it provides an additional dosing option for those patients who are at a lower cardiovascular risk or who have an increased potential for developing myopathy with statin therapy.

Conclusions

Rosuvastatin 5 mg is well tolerated and has beneficial effects across the atherogenic lipid profile by reducing LDL-C and total cholesterol, raising high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and helping a greater proportion of patients reach their LDL-C goals.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Atorvastatin is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme that converts 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. In animal models, atorvastatin lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL; atorvastatin also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Atorvastatin, as well as some of its metabolites, are pharmacologically active in humans. The liver is the primary site of action and the principal site of cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. Drug dosage, rather than systemic drug concentration, correlates better with LDL-C reduction. Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption: Atorvastatin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration; maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to atorvastatin dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14% and the systemic availability of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30%. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa and/or hepatic first-pass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25% and 9%, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDL-C reduction is similar whether atorvastatin is given with or without food. Plasma atorvastatin concentrations are lower (approximately 30% for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDL-C reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

Distribution: Mean volume of distribution of atorvastatin is approximately 381 liters. Atorvastatin is ≥ 98% bound to plasma proteins. A blood/plasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, atorvastatin is likely to be secreted in human milk [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations, (8.2)].

### Clinically relevant differences between the statins: implications for therapeutic selection [^73cb4e1c]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Although the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, or statins, share a common lipid-lowering effect, there are differences within this class of drugs. The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol-lowering efficacy, pharmacokinetic properties, drug-food interactions, and cost can vary widely, thus influencing the selection of a particular statin as a treatment option. The statins that produce the greatest percentage change in LDL cholesterol levels are atorvastatin and simvastatin. Atorvastatin and fluvastatin are least affected by alterations in renal function. Fewer pharmacokinetic drug interactions are likely to occur with pravastatin and fluvastatin, because they are not metabolized through the cytochrome P450 (3A4) system. The most cost-effective statins, based on cost per percentage change in LDL cholesterol levels, are fluvastatin, cerivastatin, and atorvastatin. Awareness of these differences may assist in the selection or substitution of an appropriate statin for a particular patient.

### Prediction of clinical irrelevance of PK differences in atorvastatin using PK / PD models derived from literature-based meta-analyses [^82e0f0c0]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Notwithstanding the above, the most stringent ("worst case") evaluation of the impact of efficacy differences between the FDC and coadministration of individual components implements the assumption that C max is correlated with the effective dose of atorvastatin. This evaluation is an extremely "conservative approach" because it actually runs contrary to the clinical evidence. These model results predict that when atorvastatin C max is different between two formulations (e.g. the largest difference of a 23% reduction for the 10/20-mg FDC; Table 1), the effect of C max on the percentage of LDL-C lowering translates directly into a change of < 1.2% absolute difference in the reduction in LDL-C (Table 4). This absolute difference based on the most stringent assumption was not predicted to be clinically relevant relative to the predicted coadministration LDL-C percentage change from baseline of 50.3–65.1% for the 10/10- to 10/80-mg dose range. Although there is no standard definition of a clinically relevant change in LDL-C, 1.2% represents a small proportion of the ~6% LDL-C change associated with titration to the next higher dose of a statin and thus would be considered not relevant in clinical practice. When more clinically relevant metrics of a change in the AUC 0–∞ or a combined change in both AUC 0–∞ and C max exist, the models predicted a smaller absolute difference in the LDL-C reduction of < 0.65%. Thus, the impact of the differences in bioavailability (specifically, C max) between the FDCs and coadministration of individual atorvastatin and ezetimibe tablets was predicted not to result in a clinically relevant change in efficacy.

### Statin drugs (simvastatin and atorvastatin) for the treatment of… [^5463be14]. NCI (2016). Low credibility.

This phase II trial compares simvastatin to standard therapy for the treatment of prostate cancer that has not spread to other parts of the body in patients undergoing surgery. In addition, this clinical trial compares the effect of simvastatin to atorvastatin in treating patients with localized prostate cancer. Simvastatin is a drug that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to help lower cholesterol and decrease the risk of heart disease. Atorvastatin blocks an enzyme that helps make cholesterol in the body. It also causes an increase in the breakdown of cholesterol. It is a type of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor and a type of statin. This trial may help researchers determine whether or not simvastatin and atorvastatin can help to reduce the risk of prostate cancer returning after surgery. II.

### High-dose atorvastatin vs usual-dose simvastatin for secondary prevention after myocardial infarction… [^8489f424]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

In a recent trial among patients with acute coronary syndromes, incremental benefit was demonstrated with more intensive lowering of LDL-C to well below 100 mg/dL. 2 In the Treating to New Targets study comparing high and low doses of atorvastatin in stable nonacute CHD, a significant improvement in prognosis with respect to cardiovascular disease was demonstrated. 3 In that study, however, the benefit of reduced cardiovascular mortality appeared to have been offset by a higher number of deaths due to noncardiovascular causes. Based on previous experience, it was projected that simvastatin therapy would produce a mean 35% reduction in LDL-C from untreated levels, while the reduction with atorvastatin, 80 mg/d, would be at least 55%, creating a difference in plasma levels of about 40 mg/dL. There were 178 coronary deaths in the simvastatin group vs 175 in the atorvastatin group.

Nonfatal myocardial infarction occurred in 321 patients in the simvastatin group and in 267 in the atorvastatin group. The composite secondary end point of a major cardiovascular event including stroke was reduced in the atorvastatin group. Similarly, there were reductions in the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction, any CHD event, and any cardiovascular event. Hemorrhagic strokes occurred in 6 patients in each treatment group. Kaplan-Meier hazard rates for selected components of the secondary end points are shown in Figure 3. There were no significant differences in the frequency of serious clinical adverse experiences between the 2 groups. There were, however, more patients in the atorvastatin group who discontinued study medication because of investigator-reported adverse effects.

Elevation of liver enzyme levels occurred more frequently in the atorvastatin group, but this was not related to any increased incidence of clinical liver disease. Myalgias occurred more frequently in the atorvastatin group, but myopathy rates were exceedingly low in both the atorvastatin and simvastatin groups.

### Low density lipoprotein-cholesterol variability in patients with type 2 diabetes taking atorvastatin compared to simvastatin: justification for direct measurement? [^30dde7a8]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Aim

The benefit of direct, as opposed to calculated, low density lipoprotein -cholesterol (LDL-C) measurement remains unclear. This study compared the biological variability of direct LDL in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) on equivalent doses of the short half-life statin, simvastatin or the longer half-life statin, atorvastatin.

Methods

A cross-over study of biological variation of lipids in 26 patients with T2DM taking either simvastatin 40 mg (n = 10) or atorvastatin 10 mg. After 3 months on one statin, fasting lipids were measured on 10 occasions over a 5-week period. The same procedure was then followed on the other statin. The variability of LDL-C was established using a Beckman direct assay.

Results

As a group, mean LDL was no different between statins (mean ± s.d.) (1.69 ± 0.60 mmol/l simvastatin vs. 1.67 ± 0.60 mmol/l atorvastatin, p = 0.19). However, in all patients, the intraindividual biological variability of LDL while taking simvastatin was markedly higher than with atorvastatin (average s.d. = 0.17 mmol /l simvastatin vs. 0.01 mmol/l, p < 0.0001). Friedewald calculated LDL variability was no different between statins (average s.d. = 0.34 mmol /l simvastatin vs. 0.21 mmol/l atorvastatin, p = 0.19).

Conclusions

In contrast to calculated values, direct measurement revealed LDL to be much more stable (the s.d. being an order of magnitude) in T2DM patients taking atorvastatin rather than simvastatin. This means LDL targets can be consistently met with less lipid monitoring using atorvastatin rather than simvastatin. Direct LDL measurement may therefore have a particular role in monitoring patients on statin treatment.

### Prediction of clinical irrelevance of PK differences in atorvastatin using PK / PD models derived from literature-based meta-analyses [^861c3b46]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

To support the development of a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of ezetimibe and atorvastatin, bioequivalence (BE) studies were conducted for all combinations of the marketed doses: 10 mg of ezetimibe in combination with 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg of atorvastatin. The results of these studies demonstrated BE for all key parameters, except for atorvastatin peak plasma concentration (C max), at the intermediate doses (Table 1). Modeling and simulation analyses were conducted to understand the impact of statin-dosing regimen and formulation on low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C) dose response and to predict the impact of the changes in exposure for ezetimibe+atorvastatin FDC on LDL-C lowering efficacy.

Clinical data provide strong evidence that the clinical efficacy (LDL-C lowering) of atorvastatin on dyslipidemia is correlated more with the atorvastatin dose and less with peak systemic drug exposure. Reductions in atorvastatin C max are not associated with changes in LDL-C lowering efficacy. The biological processes governing the changes in LDL-C occur over a range of weeks to months, whereas plasma concentrations of atorvastatin peak within an hour after dosing. The differences in timescale between C max and pharmacodynamics, along with the other information described above, provide a rationale for total daily exposure (area under the concentration–time curve (AUC)) being more predictive of changes in LDL-C in comparison with C max.

Leveraging the strong dose–response relationship for statin efficacy on LDL-C reduction, Mandema et al. developed a dose–response model for statin LDL-C lowering as monotherapy and in combination with ezetimibe. This "comparator" model or metadata analysis described dose responses of six different statins and combinations at the study-arm level. This work updated the dose–response model using published clinical data from 245 statin trials in 106,808 patients (Table 2).

To predict the potential impact of the changes in exposure for ezetimibe+atorvastatin FDC on LDL-C lowering efficacy, the differences in pharmacokinetic exposure had to be translated into LDL-C lowering. Dose–exposure models for atorvastatin AUC and C max were developed from the coadministration reference arms of the BE studies. Assuming that the observed exposures (AUC and C max) for the FDC translated into shifts in dose, effective dose distributions were generated as input for the statin dose–LDL-C model, allowing translation from exposure to LDL-C lowering efficacy.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of high-dose atorvastatin treatment in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia [^47f2013f]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

In the 2-year Atorvastatin versus Simvastatin on Atherosclerosis Progression extension study, patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who continued to take atorvastatin 80 mg for an additional 2 years had complete arrest of the progression of mean carotid intima-media thickness (0.89 mm at the start vs 0.90 mm at the end of the study, p = 0.58). In contrast, patients previously taking simvastatin 40 mg had significant regression of intima-media thickness (0.95 mm at the start vs 0.92 mm at the end of the study, p = 0.01). Therefore, both placebo- and statin-treated patients with familial hypercholesterolemia are best treated with high-dose atorvastatin, a therapeutic regimen that induces atherosclerosis regression and is safe and well tolerated over a 4-year period.

### A critical appraisal of lipid management in the post-statin era: comparison on guidelines, therapeutic targets, and screening in a case-based framework of lipid management [^1d1c778b]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Lipid-lowering therapies

A range of pharmacologic agents are available for lowering LDL-C levels, each playing a crucial role in reducing ASCVD risk. An overview of these medications is provided in Table 1; treatments specifically for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and those undergoing clinical trials are not discussed.

Table 1
Lipid-Lowering Therapies a

The first point of emphasis is that statins remain the cornerstone of LLT. Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme that controls the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis. A large body of evidence supports their use in both primary and secondary prevention of CVD. Despite their excellent safety profile, statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) are a frequent cause of discontinuation in ∼7% to 10% of patients, leading to suboptimal LDL-C control and an increased risk of recurrent cardiovascular events.

The second point to note is that in addition to statins, several nonstatin therapies have been developed and approved (Table 1). These agents offer additional options for patients requiring more substantial LDL-C reductions or those who are intolerant to statin therapy.

The third key point is that combination therapy can provide additive effects. While doubling the dose of a statin results in diminishing returns (only an additional 6% reduction in LDL-C, such as if increasing atorvastatin from 40 mg-80 mg), combining a statin with nonstatin therapies can lead to an additional 20% to 50% reduction, depending on the agent used.

### Effect of splitting simvastatin tablets for control of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^f10091be]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

The efficacy, safety, and economics of a voluntary conversion from whole simvastatin tablets to split tablets in 6 Veterans Affairs medical centers were retrospectively evaluated in 3,787 patients who received a consistent daily dose (5 to 40 mg) of simvastatin in 1999. Baseline and final low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and average change from baseline were not significantly different between groups (p > 0.05), nor were the incidence of transaminase increases (p > 0.05) or measurements of patient compliance (p = 0.07). Widespread implementation of this initiative resulted in a cost avoidance of > $1.2 million in the 6 medical centers and $10.3 million across the Veterans Affairs medical system in 1999, with > $46 million avoided in 2003.
