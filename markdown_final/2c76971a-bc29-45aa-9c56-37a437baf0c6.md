## Question

Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about iatrogenic hyperthyroidism and how to approach it step-by-step. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about definitions and how to distinguish overt from subclinical thyrotoxicosis. Then, I should verify common iatrogenic causes, including exogenous hormone and iodine-related triggers. Next, I will risk-stratify and identify who needs urgent action. After that, I should outline an etiology-focused diagnostic workup. Then, I will match treatments to causes, including special populations. Finally, I need to set monitoring, prevention strategies, and summarize a practical decision algorithm.

> Let me first confirm what we mean by iatrogenic hyperthyroidism and anchor the clinical frame. Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism is thyrotoxicosis due to medical interventions, typically excess exogenous thyroid hormone or iodine-induced dysfunction, presenting as overt hyperthyroidism with elevated free T4/T3 and suppressed TSH, or as subclinical hyperthyroidism with normal free T4/T3 and low TSH, often < 0.1 mU/L in the higher-risk category [^113HQym7] [^116LBLwf] [^1119USpW]. Wait, I should verify the epidemiology figure because 13,000 per 100,000 sounds high; the Lancet source does state large prevalence ranges across regions, so I will retain that context while focusing on management implications rather than absolute prevalence estimates [^113HQym7].

> Now, I need to identify the common iatrogenic causes systematically. Exogenous hormone excess includes intentional TSH suppression in differentiated thyroid cancer and unintentional over-replacement in treated hypothyroidism, with medication misadventures such as "hamburger thyrotoxicosis" from contaminated meat as rare events I should still keep in mind [^112Ej7Gc] [^111XeNao] [^113JCGXf]. Hold on, I should not overlook iodine-related causes: amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (Type 1 from autonomy vs Type 2 destructive thyroiditis) and iodinated contrast–induced thyrotoxicosis in susceptible hosts are key iatrogenic drivers, particularly in older patients with nodular autonomy [^111bkcZi] [^112o7GhT] [^11211vov]. Let me also check pediatric specifics: overtreatment in congenital hypothyroidism is a notable iatrogenic source early in life, especially at higher initial LT4 dosing ranges, which often forces dose reductions at the first follow-up [^112rRMgA] [^115KeymG].

> Next, I will risk-stratify because urgency and treatment thresholds depend on comorbidity and age. Patients with cardiovascular disease, older age, and postmenopausal status have higher risks of atrial fibrillation, thromboembolism, and bone loss, and are more likely to benefit from treating even subclinical hyperthyroidism when TSH is < 0.1 mU/L; that aligns with ATA guidance and the bone density meta-analysis in postmenopausal women on TSH suppression [^113HQym7] [^1119USpW] [^1128JKhP] [^112Ej7Gc]. Pregnancy requires extra caution: do not treat transient hCG-mediated TSH suppression with antithyroid drugs, but treat overt hyperthyroidism with PTU in the first trimester then switch to methimazole thereafter, balancing fetal risks and maternal control [^113aMZJb] [^114V7ZVK]. I should double-check that patients younger than 65 without cardiac or skeletal risk and with TSH between 0.1 and the lower limit of normal are generally observation candidates, which the ATA supports [^115o1zdT].

> I will now examine the diagnostic workup to confirm severity and determine etiology. First, I need to check TSH with free T4 and a measure of T3 to identify overt versus subclinical disease and clinical severity, while reviewing the medication list and recent iodine exposures including amiodarone and contrast media [^116xqtXM]. If the cause is not obvious, I should confirm Graves' with TRAb, and use RAIU or thyroid scintigraphy to distinguish thyroiditis from hyperfunction and to identify toxic nodules, while Doppler ultrasound can help characterize vascularity and AIT phenotypes when RAIU is low due to iodine load [^111Sn8K5] [^114WaLXT] [^116yBCsq]. But wait, in amiodarone patients I must differentiate Type 1 versus Type 2 AIT using clinical context, Doppler flow, and uptake patterns to guide therapy; that distinction is central to treatment selection [^111bkcZi] [^112o7GhT]. For high-risk patients after iodinated contrast, I should monitor thyroid function at 2–4 weeks and again thereafter to catch early decompensation, especially in the elderly with nodular autonomy [^116Sk9BL].

> Let me consider management when thyrotoxicosis is iatrogenic from intentional TSH suppression in thyroid cancer. I should confirm the ongoing oncologic need for stringent suppression because more recent guidance allows de-escalation in low-risk DTC, thereby mitigating cardiovascular and skeletal risks from prolonged subclinical hyperthyroidism [^113nGTgj]. I should confirm bone protection strategies in postmenopausal women given observed lumbar spine BMD loss, and consider symptom mitigation options like L-carnitine in select cases while maintaining oncologic goals, though evidence quality is limited and shared decision-making is key [^112Ej7Gc] [^113v6DZp]. Cardiovascular monitoring with ECG and blood pressure assessment, alongside selective beta-blocker use for adrenergic symptoms, is prudent in long-term suppression regimens [^113HQym7].

> Hold on, I should verify the approach to amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis because missing the subtype can harm patients. In Type 1 AIT, which reflects iodine-fueled hormone synthesis in autonomous tissue or Graves', high-dose thionamides are first-line, whereas in Type 2 AIT, which is destructive thyroiditis, oral glucocorticoids are first-line; mixed forms may need both, and amiodarone should be withdrawn when feasible, balancing arrhythmic risk with endocrine control [^112o7GhT] [^111bkcZi] [^1165ahRd] [^111wRdfv]. Wait, I initially thought thionamides would help all AIT, but that would be a mistake; in Type 2 destructive thyroiditis, steroids are the evidence-based initial therapy, not thionamides, and I should correct that reflex assumption here [^111bkcZi]. If cardiac status worsens or medical therapy fails, I need to ensure rapid multidisciplinary evaluation for urgent total thyroidectomy, which ETA explicitly supports in this high-mortality scenario, and real-world data suggest appropriate first-line therapy reduces cardiovascular events and hospitalizations compared with inappropriate regimens [^112yDPCC] [^113bR5m5].

> For iodinated contrast–induced thyrotoxicosis, I should confirm that routine prophylaxis is not recommended by ATA and that targeted post-exposure monitoring in high-risk patients is advised by multiple societies; management is largely supportive with beta-blockers, while thionamides may have limited impact when the driver is released preformed hormone rather than new synthesis, making careful clinical judgment essential [^116TZCet] [^116Sk9BL] [^11211vov]. Let me reconsider any impulse to start empirical antithyroid drugs prophylactically before contrast in all patients; guidelines advise against this, reserving intervention for those who declare clinically significant thyrotoxicosis post-exposure or are very high risk in selected protocols [^116TZCet].

> I need to check management for excessive thyroid hormone replacement or acute overdose. For chronic over-replacement, the immediate step is to lower the LT4 dose by about 25–50% and recheck TSH in 6–8 weeks to allow the axis to equilibrate, adjusting further as needed, which aligns with pharmacodynamic realities and labeling guidance [^113Qb19M] [^114PRnFp]. In acute massive ingestion, I should verify early decontamination strategies if within an hour, consider cholestyramine to reduce enterohepatic recycling, and use beta-blockers like propranolol for adrenergic symptoms, with supportive care individualized to clinical status; similar principles apply to liothyronine overdose, though timing of symptom onset can lag and requires vigilance [^113Qb19M] [^114PRnFp] [^1139P9KQ]. But wait, I also need to ensure we reassess the original indication for LT4 because overuse and unnecessary continuation are common; periodic trials off therapy under supervision can clarify true need in select patients [^111XeNao] [^115a2k8B].

> Next, I should review subclinical hyperthyroidism management to avoid over- or undertreating. I need to confirm that treatment is recommended when TSH is persistently < 0.1 mU/L in patients ≥ 65 years, in those with cardiac disease, osteoporosis, postmenopausal status without bone-protective therapy, or with symptoms, whereas observation is reasonable in younger, low-risk patients with TSH between 0.1 and the lower limit of normal if it persists but remains mild [^1119USpW] [^1128JKhP] [^115o1zdT]. For etiology-directed therapy, antithyroid drugs are appropriate for Graves'-related subclinical hyperthyroidism, whereas definitive therapy with radioactive iodine or surgery is preferred for toxic nodular disease; scintigraphic phenotype and persistence predict progression risk and often influence the timing of definitive therapy [^111crser] [^1126fhy5] [^114SSiqa].

> I will now consider special populations where nuances matter. In pregnancy, I must avoid treating hCG-mediated transient suppression, but treat overt hyperthyroidism with PTU in the first trimester and transition to methimazole thereafter to minimize teratogenic and hepatotoxic risks, aiming for free T4 in the high-normal range rather than normalizing TSH, which may remain suppressed [^113aMZJb] [^114V7ZVK]. In pediatrics, I should double-check initial LT4 dosing for congenital hypothyroidism because higher starting doses frequently precipitate iatrogenic hyperthyroxinemia at the first check; for pediatric Graves', methimazole is preferred, with RAI avoided in very young children and surgery reserved for appropriate candidates with access to high-volume thyroid surgeons [^115KeymG] [^113fo8Ka]. In the elderly, lower thresholds for treating subclinical hyperthyroidism are justified given AF and fracture risks, and AIT carries higher mortality necessitating aggressive, timely intervention [^1128JKhP] [^111wRdfv].

> Next, I should review monitoring after intervention to ensure safe trajectory back to euthyroidism. Biochemically, I need to check TSH and free T4 every 4–6 weeks after any dose change or initiation of therapy until stable, then at 6–12 month intervals, with more frequent checks after amiodarone or contrast because delayed effects can emerge; structured checkpoints at 2–4 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months post-contrast or during/after amiodarone are pragmatic for high-risk patients [^116Sk9BL]. Clinically, I should monitor cardiovascular status including pulse, rhythm screening, and blood pressure; consider DEXA for postmenopausal women on suppression; and recognize that even subclinical hyperthyroidism can affect cognitive electrophysiology and myocardial strain, though some changes may reverse with restoration of euthyroidism, while others (e.g., diastolic parameters) may be less responsive in the short term [^112Ej7Gc] [^113tnFFL] [^114J6Yvg] [^114nNzVY]. Let me verify quality of life data: prolonged suppression may not uniformly impair QoL, but targeted normalization can improve specific domains such as motivation in selected cohorts, guiding shared decisions when oncologic risk allows de-escalation [^116C8AH1].

> I need to ensure prevention and systems safeguards are in place to reduce iatrogenic cases. For medication safety, I should use structured titration protocols, avoid the highest initial LT4 doses in congenital hypothyroidism unless clearly indicated, and embed routine reassessment of LT4 necessity and dosing to avoid long-term overtreatment and overuse [^115KeymG] [^111XeNao]. For high-risk procedures, I should establish pre-amiodarone thyroid baselines, consider alternatives in those with established autonomy, and plan post-exposure laboratory surveillance for iodinated contrast in predisposed patients rather than indiscriminate prophylaxis, with close communication across teams [^116Sk9BL]. Finally, I must maintain readiness for thyroid storm recognition and treatment in severely thyrotoxic patients with systemic decompensation, employing beta-blockers, antithyroid drugs when indicated, glucocorticoids, iodide after thionamine initiation, and full supportive care per guidelines, while remembering that destructive thyroiditis–driven states need tailored regimens emphasizing steroids and support rather than synthesis blockade alone [^115ickm7] [^115jGJ5n].

> To summarize my decision flow without skipping key checks: I should first confirm thyrotoxicosis biochemically and classify as overt or subclinical; then identify iatrogenic causes from medication review and recent iodine exposures; next risk-stratify by age, cardiac status, bone health, and pregnancy to set treatment thresholds; if etiology is unclear, I will obtain TRAb, scintigraphy or uptake, and Doppler ultrasound as indicated; I will then choose etiology-specific therapy, ranging from LT4 dose reduction to thionamides, glucocorticoids, supportive beta-blockade, or surgery for refractory AIT; I will schedule 4–6 week biochemical follow-up until stable and 6–12 month surveillance thereafter, with targeted post-iodine monitoring; and I will reassess the need for ongoing TSH suppression in cancer survivors to minimize long-term harm when oncologically safe, keeping thresholds for treatment lower in older or comorbid patients per ATA guidance [^111Sn8K5] [^1119USpW] [^1128JKhP].

Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism is a clinician-induced excess of thyroid hormone, most often from **excessive levothyroxine dosing** [^114PRnFp] or **iodine-containing drugs** (amiodarone, contrast) [^112j6vLH] [^11211vov]. It presents with hypermetabolic symptoms [^116LBLwf], cardiovascular complications (notably **atrial fibrillation**) [^113HQym7], and bone loss, especially in older adults and postmenopausal women [^112Ej7Gc]. Diagnosis is biochemical (suppressed TSH, elevated free T4/T3) and requires identifying the exogenous source [^111Sn8K5] [^116xqtXM]. Management centers on stopping or reducing the offending agent [^114PRnFp], beta-blockers for symptoms [^112j6vLH], and antithyroid drugs or corticosteroids for amiodarone-induced cases; close monitoring is essential to prevent recurrence [^112o7GhT] [^111bkcZi] [^113bR5m5].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism arises from **exogenous hormone excess** [^112j6vLH] or iodine exposure. It is most commonly due to over-replacement with levothyroxine or liothyronine [^1139P9KQ] for hypothyroidism or during TSH-suppression therapy for thyroid cancer [^113HQym7], and from **iodine-containing medications** such as amiodarone and iodinated contrast, particularly in patients with nodular thyroid disease or latent Graves' [^11211vov] [^116Sk9BL]. Dietary supplements containing thyroid extract and contaminated meat (hamburger thyrotoxicosis) can also cause exogenous thyrotoxicosis [^113JCGXf]. Risk factors include **older age, pre-existing cardiac disease, osteoporosis, and autonomous thyroid nodules** [^1128JKhP] [^115a2k8B].

---

## Clinical manifestations

Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism presents with **hypermetabolic symptoms** and system-specific complications:

- **General symptoms**: Weight loss, heat intolerance [^113HQym7], sweating, anxiety, insomnia, tremor, and fatigue [^116LBLwf].

- **Cardiovascular complications**: Tachycardia, atrial fibrillation [^113HQym7], hypertension, and heart failure [^112j6vLH].

- **Skeletal complications**: Increased bone turnover, osteoporosis, and fracture risk [^112DJd5K], especially in postmenopausal women [^112Ej7Gc].

- **Neurological symptoms**: Irritability, cognitive impairment [^113tnFFL], and rarely chorea [^112bkqba].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and laboratory findings

Diagnosis relies on **biochemical confirmation** and **source identification**:

- **Laboratory findings**: Suppressed TSH [^111Sn8K5] with elevated free T4 and/or T3; subclinical cases have low TSH with normal free T4/T3 [^116LBLwf].

- **Clinical evaluation**: Detailed history of thyroid hormone use, iodine exposure, and supplements [^112j6vLH].

- **Imaging studies**: Thyroid ultrasound or scintigraphy [^111Sn8K5] to exclude endogenous hyperthyroidism [^114WaLXT].

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on **removing the cause** and controlling symptoms:

- **Discontinuation or dose adjustment**: Stop or reduce thyroid hormone therapy [^114PRnFp]; monitor TSH every 4–6 weeks until euthyroid [^115a2k8B].

- **Beta-blockers**: Propranolol or atenolol for symptom control (tachycardia, tremor, anxiety) [^112j6vLH].

- **Antithyroid drugs**: Methimazole for overt hyperthyroidism, especially in amiodarone-induced type 1 AIT [^112o7GhT] [^1179Zxa9].

- **Corticosteroids**: Prednisone for type 2 AIT or severe thyrotoxicosis [^111bkcZi].

- **Supportive care**: Hydration, electrolyte correction, and monitoring for complications [^112j6vLH].

---

## Prevention and monitoring

Prevention requires careful dosing and **regular monitoring**, with TSH checked every 6–12 months in stable patients and more frequently after dose changes or in high-risk groups [^115a2k8B]. Individualize dosing by **age, weight, and comorbidities** to avoid overtreatment, and educate patients on adherence, symptom recognition, and the risks of over-replacement.

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Prognosis is generally favorable with timely correction. However, **cardiovascular risks** such as atrial fibrillation [^113HQym7], heart failure, and mortality are higher, especially in older adults [^112DJd5K], and skeletal risks — including osteoporosis and fractures — are increased, particularly in postmenopausal women [^112Ej7Gc]. Persistent symptoms and reduced quality of life may occur despite biochemical control [^116C8AH1].

---

Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism is a preventable condition from **excess hormone or iodine exposure**. Early recognition, stopping the cause, and symptom control are key, with regular monitoring to maintain euthyroidism and prevent recurrence [^116LBLwf].

### Effect of TSH suppression therapy on bone mineral density in differentiated thyroid cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Ej7Gc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Concerns are growing about the long-term skeletal safety of TSH suppression therapy after total thyroidectomy in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) because subclinical hyperthyroidism increases the risk of osteoporosis and fractures.

We aimed to determine the effect of TSH suppression therapy on bone mineral density (BMD) in DTC patients. We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and other sources. Eligible observational studies included DTC patients who underwent TSH suppression therapy and BMD measurement. Two independent reviewers extracted data on the studies' characteristics and outcomes and determined their risk of bias. Data were extracted from each study for postmenopausal/premenopausal women's and men's lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN), and total hip (TH) BMD and summed using a random-effects meta-analysis model. The weighted mean differences with 95% CIs are expressed for the differences in outcome measurements between groups.

Seventeen studies (739 patients and 1085 controls) were included for quantitative analysis. In postmenopausal women, TSH suppression therapy showed a significant decrease in LS BMD (-0.03; -0.05, -0.02), and a similar trend was seen in TH. In premenopausal women, TSH suppression therapy significantly increased LS BMD (0.04; 0.02, 0.06) and FN BMD (0.02; 0.01, 0.04). In men, there was no significant association between TSH suppression therapy and BMD at any site compared with the controls. Evidence from observational studies suggests that postmenopausal women tr.

For the medical management of amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders, particularly hyperthyroidism, the 2018 ETA guidelines recommend initiating oral corticosteroids as first-line therapy in patients with type 2 amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis who have moderate-to-severe thyrotoxicosis. Decisions regarding the treatment of milder or subclinical forms should be based on the patient's underlying cardiac conditions, with close collaboration with a specialist cardiologist.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hyperthyroidism, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, the ATA 2016 guidelines recommend determining the etiology of thyrotoxicosis. If the diagnosis is not apparent based on the clinical presentation and initial biochemical evaluation, perform diagnostic testing, including:

- **Measurement of thyrotropin receptor antibodies**: This helps confirm the presence and nature of the condition.
- **Determination of the radioactive iodine uptake**: This test assesses the function of the thyroid gland.
- **Measurement of thyroidal blood flow on ultrasound**: This provides insight into the vascular activity of the thyroid.

### Hyperthyroidism [^113HQym7]. Lancet (2003). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyperthyroidism:

- **Definition**: Hyperthyroidism is a pathological syndrome in which tissue is exposed to excessive amounts of circulating thyroid hormone.

- **Pathophysiology**: Causes of hyperthyroidism include increased synthesis of thyroid hormones (e.g. Grave's disease), release of preformed thyroid hormones due to destruction of thyroid tissue (e.g. thyroiditis), and exogenous thyroid hormone intake.

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of hyperthyroidism is estimated at 13,000 per 100,000 population. In Europe, the prevalence of hyperthyroidism is estimated at 800 per 100,000 population.

- **Disease course**: Hyperthyroidism leads to a higher incidence of AF and atrial flutter, and, at least partly by that mechanism, a higher risk of cerebral arterial thrombosis. Hyperthyroidism additionally leads to increased bone turnover and a negative bone balance.

### Contrast induced hyperthyroidism due to iodine excess [^11211vov]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism is a thyrotoxic condition caused by exposure to excessive iodine. Historically, this type of hyperthyroidism has been described in areas of iodine deficiency. With advances in medicine, iodine-induced hyperthyroidism has been observed following the use of drugs containing iodine, for example, amiodarone, and contrast agents used in radiological imaging. In elderly patients, it is frequently difficult to diagnose and control contrast-related hyperthyroidism as most of these patients do not always present with typical signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Treatment can be very challenging as drugs commonly used to treat hyperthyroidism have little effect on already formed thyroid hormone due to iodine excess.

### Alterations of cognitive functions induced by exogenous application of thyroid hormones in healthy men: A double-blind cross-over study using event-related brain potentials [^113tnFFL]. Thyroid (2001). Low credibility.

The influence of experimentally induced subclinical hyperthyroidism on cognitive functions was tested using exogenous thyroxine or placebo. In a double-blind cross-over design, 24 healthy young men received either 300 micrograms of levothyroxine or a placebo for two consecutive 3-week periods. Determination of thyrotropin (TSH), total triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) confirmed the induction of subclinical hyperthyroidism.

Three weeks after treatment with placebo or T4, subjects were tested in two visual search tasks. One task required the serial scanning of a stimulus array of eight items to detect a missing feature (serial task), while the other allowed for the parallel processing of eight items to detect an extra feature. Reaction times varied greatly between the tasks, yet no effect of T4 medication was revealed on overt search behavior.

The late cognitive components of the event-related brain potentials (ERP) were registered during the tasks using a multichannel recording. The late positive component (P300) to target stimuli showed a significant reduction in amplitude in the parallel search task in hyperthyroidism. For the serial search task, a significant frontal negativity was revealed for target stimuli, both suggesting increased effort needed for executing visual search tasks.

Thus, short periods of subclinical hyperthyroidism, within the range commonly induced for treating thyroid cancer patients, cause distinct alterations in brain-electric activity.

### Usefulness of L-carnitine, a naturally occurring peripheral antagonist of thyroid hormone action, in iatrogenic hyperthyroidism: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^113v6DZp]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

Old studies in animals and unblinded studies in a few hyperthyroid patients suggested that L-carnitine is a peripheral antagonist of thyroid hormone action, at least in some tissues. This conclusion was substantiated by our recent observation that carnitine inhibits thyroid hormone entry into the nucleus of hepatocytes, neurons, and fibroblasts.

In the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 6-month trial reported here, we assessed whether 2 or 4 g/d oral L-carnitine was able to both reverse and prevent/minimize nine hyperthyroidism-related symptoms. We also evaluated changes in nine thyroid hormone-sensitive biochemical parameters and in vertebral and hip mineral density (bone mineral density).

Fifty women under a fixed TSH-suppressive dose of L-T(4) for all 6 months were randomly allocated to five groups of 10 subjects each. Group 0 associated placebo for 6 months; groups A2 and A4 started associating placebo (first bimester), substituted placebo with 2 or 4 g/d carnitine (second bimester), and then returned to the association with placebo. Groups B2 and B4 started associating 2 and 4 g/d carnitine for the first two bimesters, and then substituted carnitine with placebo (third bimester).

- **Symptoms and biochemical parameters in group 0**: These worsened throughout the study.

- **Group A findings**: Symptoms and biochemical parameters worsened during the first bimester, returned to baseline or increased minimally during the second bimester (except osteocalcin and urinary OH-proline), and worsened again in the third bimester.

- **Group B findings**: Symptoms and biochemical parameters (except osteocalcin and urinary OH-pr…

### Thyrotoxicosis associated with the use of amiodarone: The utility of ultrasound in patient management [^116yBCsq]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is an anti-arrhythmic drug that commonly affects the thyroid, causing hypothyroidism or thyrotoxicosis. Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) is caused by excessive thyroid hormone biosynthesis in response to an iodine load in autonomously functioning thyroid glands with pre-existing nodular goitre or underlying Graves' disease (type 1 or AIT 1), or by a destructive thyroiditis typically occurring in normal glands (type 2 or AIT 2). Indeterminate or mixed forms are also recognized. The distinction is clinically useful as AIT 1 is treated predominantly with thionamides, whereas AIT 2 is managed with glucocorticoids. We review the tools used to differentiate type 1 from type 2 thyrotoxicosis, with specific reference to the imaging modalities used.

### Real-life data on the effect of medical therapy for amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis on CV events and hospitalizations [^113bR5m5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Patients with amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) often receive initial therapy for thyrotoxicosis in various medical settings before admission to a referral center.

This study aimed to determine whether first-line medical therapy, specifically therapies for thyrotoxicosis at the first diagnosis of AIT, affects patient outcomes. A single-center historical-prospective cohort study was conducted on 313 AIT patients. Clinical and biochemical data were collected at the first diagnosis, at a referral center, and throughout the course of AIT. The primary outcomes were cardiovascular (CV) events and hospitalizations.

First-line therapies were deemed appropriate when they included glucocorticoids for type 2 AIT and methimazole for type 1 AIT at the approved dose, either alone (optimal medical therapy, OMT) or in combination (right-dose combination therapy, RCT). Other therapies, including no therapy, were considered not appropriate. The duration of exposure to thyrotoxicosis was measured from the first diagnosis of AIT to its remission.

Results showed that 34.5% of patients received appropriate therapies (28.1% OMT, 6.4% RCT), whereas the remaining 65.5% received inappropriate therapies. CV events and hospitalizations were more frequent in patients who received inappropriate therapies (33.2% vs. 4.5% and 24.9% vs. 6.5%, respectively; P < .0001 for both). Appropriate therapies significantly reduced serum thyroid hormone concentrations (P = 0.018) from first diagnosis to referral, unlike inappropriate therapies.

### Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism in primary congenital hypothyroidism: Prevalence and predictive factors [^112rRMgA]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Primary congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is a preventable cause of mental retardation. Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism has occasionally been reported using the recommended LT4 dosage. Currently, information regarding iatrogenic hyperthyroidism and predictive factors for permanent hypothyroidism (P-CH) among Thai patients is lacking. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence and factors for predicting iatrogenic hyperthyroidism at one month after LT4 initiation and for predicting P-CH in primary CH infants.

This retrospective cohort study involved 87 infants with primary CH. Patients were classified by thyroid status at one month after LT4 initiation. At three years, patients were reevaluated after LT4 cessation and assigned as P-CH or transient CH (T-CH). Differences between groups were analyzed.

One month after LT4 initiation, 35.6% of patients were classified as having iatrogenic hyperthyroidism. An initial LT4 dose of 10.2 μg/kg/day (sensitivity 64.5%, specificity 71.4%) was a suitable cutoff value for predicting iatrogenic hyperthyroidism, wherein 55.6% and 21.6% of patients were treated with initial doses of ≥ 10.2 and < 10.2 μg/kg/day, respectively (p = 0.004). The initial LT4 dose was the only predictive factor for thyroid status after initial treatment. At reevaluation, 47.4% of patients were diagnosed with P-CH. LT4 dosage at three years of age was significantly higher in patients with P-CH (3.3 vs. 2.85 μg/kg/day, p = 0.02) and the only relevant factor for predicting P-CH.

Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism is common among infants with primary congenital hypothyroidism.

Regarding the medical management of hyperthyroidism, particularly in relation to potassium iodide, the 2016 ATA guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to recommend potassium iodide for the treatment of hyperthyroidism. However, potassium iodide may be beneficial for select patients with hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease, those who have adverse reactions to antithyroid drugs, and those who have a contraindication to or aversion to radioactive iodine therapy, repeat radioactive iodine therapy, or surgery.

### Critical approach to hypothyroid patients with persistent symptoms [^115gM4sL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common condition, with numerous studies published over the last decade assessing the potential risks associated with inappropriate treatment. The standard of care for hypothyroidism treatment remains levothyroxine (LT4), administered at doses to achieve biochemical and clinical euthyroidism. However, about 15% of hypothyroid patients experience residual symptoms. Some population-based studies and international surveys have confirmed dissatisfaction with LT4 treatment among certain hypothyroid patients. It is well established that LT4-treated hypothyroid patients exhibit higher serum thyroxine:triiodothyronine ratios and can have a persistent increase in cardiovascular risk factors.

Variants in deiodinases and thyroid hormone transporter genes have been associated with subnormal T3 concentrations, persistent symptoms in LT4-treated patients, and improved outcomes with the addition of liothyronine to LT4 therapy. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) and European Thyroid Association (ETA) guidelines have evolved, recognizing the potential limitations of LT4. This shift is reflected in prescribing patterns, with physicians increasingly employing combination therapy.

Randomized clinical trials have been recently published; although they have found no improvement in treating hypothyroid patients, several notable limitations have hindered generalizability. Meta-analyses have reported a preference rate for combination therapy in 46.2% of hypothyroid patients treated with LT4.

### Subclinical thyrotoxicosis in an outpatient population - predictors of outcome [^114SSiqa]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Individuals with endogenous subclinical thyrotoxicosis (SCT) may subsequently require treatment for overt disease. We aimed to evaluate the frequency of progression to hyperthyroidism and factors influencing this outcome.

- **Design**: This is a retrospective analysis of outcome in 96 consecutive patients (aged 16–91 years) diagnosed with SCT over a 6-year period. Individuals with secondary causes of TSH suppression were excluded. The mean follow-up was 3.8 years. The significance of age, gender, family history of thyrotoxicosis, symptoms at presentation, thyroid nodule(s) on clinical examination, entry TSH level, antithyroid antibody status, and (99m)Tc pertechnetate thyroid imaging results on the subsequent development of overt thyrotoxicosis was assessed.

- **Results**: Progression to overt thyrotoxicosis was seen in 8% at 1 year, 16% at 2 years, 21% at 3 years, and 26% at 5 years. Multivariate analysis identified scintiscan diagnosis as the only independent predictor of outcome (P = 0.003), with the cumulative percentage requiring therapy at 5 years being 9% for subclinical Graves' disease, 21% for multinodular goitre, and 61% for the autonomous nodule subgroup.

- **Conclusions**: Progression of SCT to overt hyperthyroidism occurred at a rate of 5–8% per year, with disease etiology, as determined by thyroid scintigraphy, significantly influencing the risk of progression.

### Heart failure as a serious complication of iodinated contrast-induced hyperthyroidism: Case-report [^116Sk9BL]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

There are several causes for the development of hyperthyroidism, the most common of which are Graves' disease and thyroid autonomy. Exposure to iodinated contrast media (ICM) can also cause hyperthyroidism due to the disruption of thyroid hormone regulation. This is especially observed in the elderly, where multinodular goitre and accompanying thyroid autonomy are more frequently present. Although rare, ICM-induced hyperthyroidism can have severe consequences. ICMs are widely used in diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, such as cardiac catheterization and computed tomography (CT). Guidelines from the Radiological Society of the Netherlands and the Netherlands Association of Internal Medicine do not recommend standard laboratory testing of thyroid function or thyroid ultrasound investigation prior to ICM exposure. Prophylaxis is not recommended, although the European Society of Urogenital Radiology has concluded that it may offer some protection in high-risk patients. Furthermore, guidelines state that high-risk patients should be carefully monitored after the administration of ICM.

Here, we aim to present a case of ICM-induced hyperthyroidism that has contributed to a heart failure-related complication secondary to an ischemic event. This case study reviews the evidence that could potentially explain the physiopathology behind this case and discusses the application of guidelines in daily clinical practice.

The 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines provide insights on diagnostic investigations for amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders. Specifically, regarding laboratory tests, the guidelines recommend obtaining thyroid function tests to identify disorders associated with iodine-induced hyperthyroidism (type 1 amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis). This includes conditions such as toxic nodular disease and previously occult Graves' disease in clinically stable patients with amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis.

### A stepwise approach to the evaluation and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism [^115eGybG]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study are to review a stepwise approach to the evaluation and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism.

- **Methods**: English-language articles regarding clinical management of subclinical hyperthyroidism, published between 2007 and 2012, were reviewed.

- **Results**: Subclinical hyperthyroidism is encountered on a daily basis in clinical practice. When evaluating patients with a suppressed serum thyrotropin value, it is important to exclude other potential etiologies such as overt triiodothyronine toxicosis, drug effect, nonthyroidal illness, and central hypothyroidism. In younger patients with mild thyrotropin suppression, it is acceptable to perform testing again in 3 to 6 months to assess for persistence before performing further diagnostic testing. In older patients or patients with thyrotropin values less than 0.1 mIU/L, diagnostic testing should proceed without delay. Persistence of thyrotropin suppression is more typical of nodular thyroid autonomy, whereas thyroiditis and mild Graves disease frequently resolve spontaneously. The clinical consequences of subclinical hyperthyroidism, such as atrial dysrhythmia, accelerated bone loss, increased fracture rate, and higher rates of cardiovascular mortality, are dependent on age and severity. The decision to treat subclinical hyperthyroidism is directly tied to an assessment of the potential for clinical consequences in untreated disease. Definitive therapy is generally selected for patients with nodular autonomous function, whereas antithyroid drug therapy is more appropriate for mild, persistent Graves disease.

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes of an exogenous thyrotoxicosis epidemic in prison [^113JCGXf]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2023). Low credibility.

Thyrotoxicosis is a manifestation of excessive thyroid hormones, which has a hypermetabolic effect. Common aetiologies of thyrotoxicosis are Graves' disease and toxic multinodular goitre. Uncommon aetiologies include thyroiditis, ectopic thyroid hormone production, and exogenous thyrotoxicosis, both intentional and unintentional, such as ingestion of meat contaminated with thyroid tissue or hamburger thyrotoxicosis.

The first case of hamburger thyrotoxicosis was reported in 1984. During the same period in 1985, a Minnesota case-control study found that gullet trimming of thyroid tissue, a procedure that removes muscle from the bovine larynx for beef, was tolerant to heat. From these studies, the US Department of Agriculture prohibited the procedure of gullet trimmings in all meat-packing plants. However, outbreaks of hamburger thyrotoxicosis have been reported in many countries.

In Thailand, thyrotoxicosis outbreaks have been reported in 10 prisons with a total of 1,047 cases from 2016 to 2019. A total of 30 patients were admitted to the hospital. In 2016, a case-control study of the first outbreak in Thailand showed that pork consumption was associated with the outbreak. In 2019, during the sixth outbreak in Thailand, 145 patients were diagnosed with thyrotoxicosis and 14 patients with hypokalaemia. The pork sample was examined, and a high level of thyroid hormone was found. The assumption about the aetiologies of thyrotoxicosis and hypokalaemia was the contamination of meat due to the presence of thyroid tissue. However, previous studies reported only the data of hospital…

### Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism does not promote weight loss or prevent ageing-related increases in body mass in thyroid cancer survivors [^116ng3ez]. Clinical Endocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

Thyroid cancer survivors represent a unique population where the long-term effects of intentional thyroid hormone withdrawal and prolonged iatrogenic hyperthyroidism on body weight and mass were evaluated.

- **Objectives**: The objectives of this study were to characterize body mass changes over several years in a cohort of thyroid cancer patients with iatrogenic hyperthyroidism and to compare these changes with the expected weight gain in age-matched healthy control populations. We also evaluated the possibility that the method of preparation — thyroid hormone withdrawal (THW) vs. recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) — for radioactive iodine remnant ablation may be associated with differences in body mass at the time of the final follow-up.

- **Design/setting/patients/interventions**: A retrospective review identified 153 patients with thyroid cancer who underwent total thyroidectomy at one major medical centre. Of the 153 patients, 143 also had radioactive iodine remnant ablation: 70 after THW and 73 after rhTSH.

- **Main outcome measures**: Change in weight and BMI at 1–2 and 3–5 years of follow-up were examined. Annualized weight variation within the cohort was compared with age-matched population controls, expressed in kilogram per year.

- **Results**: Significant weight gain was noted for the full cohort after 3–5 years of follow-up compared to baseline (76 ± 21 kg at baseline vs. 79 ± 23 kg at 3–5 years of follow-up, P < 0.01), which represented a 3.2% increase. Female and male patients with thyroid cancer experienced 0.46 and 0.94 kg/year weight changes, respectively.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: Management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^1172c3sL]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

Thyrotoxicosis has multiple etiologies, manifestations, and potential therapies. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions and patient preference. This article describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of thyrotoxicosis that would be useful to generalist and subspecialty physicians, and others providing care for patients with this condition.

The development of these guidelines was commissioned by the American Thyroid Association in association with the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists. The American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this report. The task force examined relevant literature using a systematic PubMed search, supplemented with additional published materials. An evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated the knowledge and experience of the panel was used to develop the text and a series of specific recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting each was rated according to the approach recommended by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Group.

Clinical topics addressed include the initial evaluation and management of thyrotoxicosis; management of Graves' hyperthyroidism using radioactive iodine, antithyroid drugs, or surgery; management of toxic multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma using radioactive iodine or surgery; and Graves' disease in children and adolescents.

### Hyperthyroidism [^112j6vLH]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Thyrotoxicosis is a general term for excess circulating and tissue thyroid hormone levels, whereas hyperthyroidism specifically denotes disorders involving a hyperactive thyroid gland, such as Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and toxic adenoma. Diagnosis and determination of the cause rely on clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine ablation, or thyroidectomy. Other types of thyrotoxicosis are monitored and treated with β-blockers to control symptoms, given that most of these conditions resolve spontaneously.

### Armour thyroid [^113Qb19M]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Overdosage - signs and symptoms**: Excessive doses of thyroid result in a hypermetabolic state resembling, in every respect, the condition of endogenous origin. The condition may be self-induced.

- **Treatment of overdosage**: Dosage should be reduced, or therapy temporarily discontinued if signs and symptoms of overdosage appear. Treatment may be reinstituted at a lower dosage. In normal individuals, normal hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis function is restored in 6 to 8 weeks after thyroid suppression.

Treatment of acute massive thyroid hormone overdosage is aimed at reducing gastrointestinal absorption of the drugs and counteracting central and peripheral effects, mainly those of increased sympathetic activity. Vomiting may be induced initially if further gastrointestinal absorption can reasonably be prevented, barring contraindications such as coma, convulsions, or loss of the gagging reflex. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Oxygen may be administered, and ventilation maintained. Cardiac glycosides may be indicated if congestive heart failure develops. Measures to control fever, hypoglycemia, or fluid loss should be instituted if needed. Antiadrenergic agents, particularly propranolol, have been used advantageously in the treatment of increased sympathetic activity. Propranolol may be administered intravenously at a dosage of 1 to 3 mg over a 10-minute period or orally, 80 to 160 mg/day initially, especially when no contraindications exist for its use. Other adjunctive measures may include administration of cholestyramine to interfere with thyroxine absorption.

This procedure is also advised for patients whose thyrotoxicosis is unresponsive to medical therapies. The decision to proceed with thyroidectomy should be made by a multidisciplinary team that includes specialist endocrinologists, cardiologists, anesthesiologists, and high-volume thyroid surgeons.

### The management of subclinical hyperthyroidism by thyroid specialists [^1126fhy5]. Thyroid (2003). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is a relatively common condition for which prospectively derived, evidence-based management guidelines do not exist. We conducted a case-based mail survey to solicit opinions from members of the American Thyroid Association (ATA) about the various issues that arise in the management of patients with this disorder. The survey was completed and returned by 185 of 300 (62%) of the original recipients.

- **Hypothetical cases**: Four hypothetical cases varying in age, thyrotropin (TSH) level, and underlying etiology were presented. The majority of respondents recommended further evaluation of all cases, most commonly choosing a radioactive iodine uptake (42%-71%), thyroid scan (39%-68%), and antithyroid (TPO/Tg) antibodies (49%-55%) as additional tests to be ordered.

- **Recommendations for observation**: A large majority (84%) recommended observation rather than active treatment for a young patient with a low but detectable serum TSH level. A small majority also recommended observation alone for a young woman with an undetectable serum TSH level (58%) and for an older woman with a low but detectable serum TSH value (63%).

- **Treatment preferences**: However, the majority (66%) favored treating an older woman with an undetectable serum TSH. When treatment was advised in patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism, respondents strongly favored anti-thyroid drugs when the etiology was Graves' disease and radioactive iodine when the etiology was toxic nodular thyroid disease.

In the absence of adequate evidence-based guidelines, it is hoped that this survey of expert opinions may provide useful guidance for physicians.

### Hyperthyroidism [^116LBLwf]. Lancet (2024). High credibility.

Thyrotoxicosis causes a variety of symptoms and adverse health outcomes. Hyperthyroidism refers to increased thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion, most commonly from Graves' disease or toxic nodular goitre, whereas thyroiditis (typically autoimmune, viral, or drug-induced) causes thyrotoxicosis without hyperthyroidism. The diagnosis is based on suppressed serum concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) accompanied by free thyroxine and total or free tri-iodothyronine concentrations, which are raised (overt hyperthyroidism) or within range (subclinical hyperthyroidism). The underlying cause is determined by clinical assessment, detection of TSH-receptor antibodies, and, if necessary, radionuclide thyroid scintigraphy.

- **Treatment options**: For hyperthyroidism, treatments include antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine, and thyroidectomy, whereas thyroiditis is managed symptomatically or with glucocorticoid therapy. In Graves' disease, the first-line treatment is a 12–18-month course of antithyroid drugs. For goitre, radioactive iodine or surgery are preferred for toxic nodules or goitres. Evidence also supports long-term treatment with antithyroid drugs as an option for patients with Graves' disease and toxic nodular goitre.

### Exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism during adolescence: Effect on peak bone mass [^116U4fVw]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic subclinical hyperthyroidism induced by suppressive doses of L-thyroxine (L-T4) therapy, known as exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, may cause diminished bone mass in postmenopausal women. However, the effect of subclinical hyperthyroidism during childhood and adolescence on peak bone mass has not yet been evaluated. The study aimed to determine whether exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism during adolescence, a critical period for bone mass acquisition, would reduce peak bone mass.

Eighteen female adolescents and young adults with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and euthyroid goiter (aged 22.4 ± 4.4 years) who had been treated with suppressive doses of L-T4 (127.5 ± 23.7 µg/day) during adolescence (age at onset of subclinical hyperthyroidism, 14.2 ± 1.5 years) for 6.3 ± 3.4 years were enrolled in the study. Twenty-nine healthy female volunteers matched for age, weight, height, and body mass index served as the controls. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry.

- **Results**: BMD of the lumbar spine, radius, Ward's triangle, and total body were comparable in the two groups. In contrast, BMD of the femoral neck, trochanter, and shaft in patients was slightly higher than in controls. There were no correlations between BMD values and clinical parameters.

- **Conclusion**: Exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism during adolescence has no demonstrable detrimental effect on peak bone mass attainment.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: When to consider treatment [^112DJd5K]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by a low or undetectable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level, with normal free thyroxine and total or free triiodothyronine levels. It can be caused by increased endogenous production of thyroid hormone (e.g. in Graves disease, toxic nodular goiter, or transient thyroiditis); by administration of thyroid hormone to treat malignant thyroid disease; or by unintentional excessive replacement therapy. The prevalence of subclinical hyperthyroidism in the general population is about 1% to 2%; however, it may be higher in iodine-deficient areas.

The rate of progression to overt hyperthyroidism is higher in persons with thyroid-stimulating hormone levels less than 0.1 mIU per L than in persons with low but detectable thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and heart failure in older adults, increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, and decreased bone mineral density and increased bone fracture risk in postmenopausal women. However, the effectiveness of treatment in preventing these conditions is unclear. A possible association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and quality-of-life parameters and cognition is controversial.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in asymptomatic persons. The American Thyroid Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommend treating patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone levels below certain thresholds, although specific guidelines can vary.

### Both exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism and short-term overt hypothyroidism affect myocardial strain in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma [^114J6Yvg]. Thyroid (2011). Low credibility.

The cardiovascular effects of transitions from exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism to short-term overt hypothyroidism in patients treated for differentiated thyroid carcinoma remain unclear. This study aims to evaluate the changes in multidirectional myocardial strain using two-dimensional (2D) speckle tracking during this controlled transition.

- **Methods**: The study included 14 patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma on thyrotropin suppressive thyroxine substitution who were subsequently withdrawn from thyroxine for 4 weeks. Cardiac function was assessed by 2D speckle tracking echocardiography before and 1 and 4 weeks after withdrawal and compared with values obtained in a control group of 24 individuals.

- **Results**: At baseline, the left ventricular dimensions were significantly higher in patients compared to controls. Using 2D speckle tracking imaging, the patients had significantly impaired baseline myocardial systolic function in the circumferential (-16.0% ± 2.1% vs. -19.2% ± 3.0%, p = 0.001) and longitudinal (-17.1% ± 2.5% vs. -19.7% ± 3.0%, p = 0.001) directions compared to controls. Withdrawal of thyroid hormone did not induce significant changes in left ventricular dimensions or systolic function. During the transition from exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism to overt hypothyroidism, a significant improvement in circumferential and longitudinal systolic shortening was observed and returned to abnormal values when the patients were overt hypothyroid.

### Quality of life in longterm exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism and the effects of restoration of euthyroidism, a randomized controlled trial [^116C8AH1]. Clinical Endocrinology (2006). High credibility.

The impact of prolonged subclinical hyperthyroidism on quality of life is unclear. Therefore, we evaluated the quality of life in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) on TSH-suppressive thyroxine therapy as a model for subclinical hyperthyroidism, and we investigated whether restoration to euthyroidism affects quality of life.

- **Design**: We performed a prospective, single-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of six months' duration with two parallel groups.

- **Patients and methods**: Twenty-four subjects with a history of differentiated thyroid carcinoma and more than ten years of TSH-suppressive therapy with L-thyroxine completed the study. The L-thyroxine dose was replaced by study medication containing L-thyroxine or L-thyroxine plus placebo. Medication was titrated to establish the continuation of TSH suppression (low-TSH group) and euthyroidism (euthyroid group). Both groups consisted of 12 patients. We evaluated quality of life using five validated questionnaires.

- **Results**: At baseline, the somatic disorder questionnaire (SDQ) indicated more somatic dysfunction in patients compared to reference values, whereas the depression score (HADS) revealed a better score than the reference group. All other quality of life parameters were normal. At baseline, no significant differences between the low-TSH and euthyroidism groups were observed. After six months, none of the quality of life parameters in the low-TSH group was different from baseline values. In the euthyroid group, motivation was significantly improved (Multidimensional Fatigue Index-20, P = 0.003).

### French endocrine society guidance on endocrine side effects of immunotherapy [^113eXp1H]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2019). Low credibility.

- **Treatment and follow-up of thyroid dysfunction**:

Thyrotoxicosis is most often transitory, and its treatment depends on the clinical severity and etiological diagnosis. Treatment must be decided in agreement between the treating endocrinologist and oncologist or specialist. Corticosteroid therapy should be considered only in clinically severe cases of thyrotoxicosis.

Hypothyroidism most often appears as a second phase after thyrotoxicosis induced by silent inflammatory thyroiditis. The decision to treat should take into account the general state of the patient, the presence of comorbidities, especially cardiac comorbidity, as well as the clinical and biochemical severity of the hypothyroidism. The evolution of hypothyroidism after withdrawal of ICPI is not well known. Thyroid hormones are usually necessary on a long-term basis in patients with hypothyroidism following transient thyrotoxicosis, but follow-up is not consensual.

- **Treatment strategy**:
	- R4.3a: The treatment strategy for thyroid abnormalities in the course of ICPI for cancer should be agreed upon between the treating endocrinologist and the clinician prescribing ICPI.

- **Asymptomatic and symptomatic thyrotoxicosis**:
	- R4.3b: In cases of asymptomatic thyrotoxicosis, clinical and hormonal monitoring can be proposed. In the case of symptomatic thyrotoxicosis, treatment with beta-blockers is recommended in the absence of contraindications.

- **ICPI-induced hypothyroidism treatment**:
	- R4.3c: The treatment of ICPI-induced hypothyroidism is based on levothyroxine. This is justified in cases where TSH concentrations exceed 10 miU/L and should be discussed when TSH levels are between 5 and 10 mIU/L, found on two consecutive assays.

### Approach to the patient with subclinical hyperthyroidism [^116z1K3j]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, defined by normal circulating levels of free T4 and T3 and low levels of TSH, is a common clinical entity. It is typically caused by the same conditions that account for most cases of overt hyperthyroidism: Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and solitary autonomously functioning thyroid nodules. Subclinical hyperthyroidism has been associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and mortality, decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, and mild hyperthyroid symptoms.

Treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism remains controversial, given the lack of prospective randomized controlled trials showing clinical benefit with restoration of the euthyroid state. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to treat older individuals whose serum TSH levels are less than 0.1 mU/liter and certain high-risk patients, even when the serum TSH is between 0.1 and the lower limit of the normal range.

### Does initial dosing of levothyroxine in infants with congenital hypothyroidism lead to frequent dose adjustments secondary to iatrogenic hyperthyroidism on follow-up [^115KeymG]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is the most common preventable cause of intellectual disability. The recommended starting dose of levothyroxine (LT4) is between 10 and 15 μg/kg, an extremely wide range. We hypothesized that a sizable proportion of newborns treated for CH at the higher end of the dosage range become biochemically hyperthyroid at a follow-up visit.

- **Methods**: This study is a retrospective chart review of infants with CH between 2002 and 2012.

- **Results**: Of the 104 patients included in this analysis, the average age at diagnosis was 11 days and the average starting dose of LT4 was 12 ± 2.5 μg/kg. At follow-up, 36.5% required a dose reduction because of iatrogenic hyperthyroxinemia, 51% required no dose adjustment, and 12.5% required a dose increase due to elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The starting doses of LT4 for those requiring a dose reduction, those not requiring an adjustment, and those requiring an increase in the dose were 13.2 ± 2.4, 11.5 ± 2.1, and 10.3 ± 2.6 μg/kg/day, respectively (p ≤ 0.0001). Of the 34% of infants treated with an initial dose of > 12.5 μg/kg/day, 57.1% required a dose reduction at follow-up, compared to 26.1% of those whose initial starting dose was ≤ 12.5 μg/kg/day (p = 0.007).

- **Conclusions**: Following the guidelines for initiating therapy for CH, 36.5% of the infants required a dose reduction for iatrogenic hyperthyroxinemia. These infants received a higher dose of LT4 than the infants who either required no adjustment or required an increase in the dose. A narrower range for initial dosing in CH may be appropriate.

### Iatrogenic hypoparathyroidism development after thyroidectomy: A retrospective cohort study [^113SVz9Z]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

- **Participants' characteristics**: Among the cohort of 343 participants following thyroidectomy, a total of 130 individuals (37.90%) experienced the development of hypoparathyroidism following the procedure. The majority of patients were female, with a count of 275 (80.17%), among whom 107 (38.91%) developed hypoparathyroidism. The study included 68 male participants (19.83%), and among them, 23 individuals (33.82%) developed hypoparathyroidism. Among the participants who developed hypoparathyroidism, 59 individuals (35.76%) had comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus (n = 26, 42.62%), hyperthyroidism (n = 5, 35.72%), hypertension (n = 28, 38.89%), ischemic heart disease (n = 2, 25.00%), or dyslipidaemia (n = 15, 41.67%). The average age of participants in the hypoparathyroidism group was 46.21 ± 16.11 years, whereas it was 44.81 ± 14.11 years in the non-hypoparathyroidism group (p = 0.59).

Regarding the surgery type, out of the 130 patients who developed hypoparathyroidism, 123 underwent total thyroidectomy whereas only seven patients developed it after hemithyroidectomy.

- **The association of pre/postoperative biochemical profile with iatrogenic hypoparathyroidism**: There was no significant correlation found between the preoperative levels of calcium (p = 0.15), phosphorus (p = 0.30), magnesium (p = 0.14), PTH (p = 0.46), and vitamin D (p = 0.46).

### Body composition, resting energy expenditure, and metabolic changes in women diagnosed with differentiated thyroid carcinoma [^1172YZ7K]. Thyroid (2019). Low credibility.

Thyroid hormones heavily impact energy expenditure, body mass, and body composition. Their role in the state of exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism in differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) patients, however, is less well defined. The first aim of this study was to assess changes in body weight, body composition, resting energy expenditure (REE), respiratory quotient (RQ), and metabolic parameters in female DTC patients, starting from the phase of a euthyroid state before total thyroidectomy and continuing through the subsequent year after thyrotropin (TSH) suppression. The second aim was to assess the relationship between these variables and thyroid function parameters.

- **Methods**: This observational case series analyzed changes in body composition, calorimetric, and metabolic parameters of 15 DTC female patients at five time points: (1) at initial DTC diagnosis (euthyroid state), (2) at 2–3 weeks after thyroidectomy (hypothyroid state), (3) at 2–3 months of levothyroxine (LT4) treatment (exogenous euthyroid state), (4) after 6–9 months, and (5) after 1 year of TSH suppressive LT4 therapy (exogenous subclinical hyperthyroid state). A generalized estimating equation (GEE) analysis was performed to estimate the longitudinal correlations of the total triiodothyronine (TT3)/free thyroxine (fT4) ratio (as an independent variable) with body composition, metabolic, and calorimetric parameter changes (as dependent variables).

- **Results**: REE, REE per kilogram of lean body mass (REE/LBM), pulse, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly higher after TSH suppressive LT4 therapy.

### Glucose tolerance and lipid profile in long-term exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism and the effects of restoration of euthyroidism, a randomised controlled trial [^115C8YBh]. Clinical Endocrinology (2006). High credibility.

The impact of prolonged subclinical hyperthyroidism on glucose and lipid metabolism is unclear. Therefore, we evaluated glucose and lipid metabolism in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) on TSH suppressive thyroxine therapy as a model for subclinical hyperthyroidism and investigated whether restoration to euthyroidism affects metabolism.

- **Design**: We performed a prospective, single-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomised trial of 6 months duration with 2 parallel groups.

- **Patients**: Twenty-five subjects with a history of differentiated thyroid carcinoma with more than 10 years of TSH-suppressive therapy with l-thyroxine completed the study. The l-thyroxine dose was replaced by study medication containing l-thyroxine or l-thyroxine plus placebo. Medication was titrated to establish continuation of TSH suppression (low-TSH group, 13 patients) and euthyroidism (euthyroidism group, 12 patients).

- **Measurements**: We evaluated glucose metabolism by glucose tolerance test and HOMA (IR) and lipid metabolism by lipid profile. In addition, we measured plasma concentrations of glucoregulatory hormones.

- **Results**: At baseline, glucose tolerance, HOMA (IR), lipid profile, and plasma concentrations of glucoregulatory hormones were within the normal range. No significant differences between the low TSH and euthyroidism group were observed. After 6 months, neither glucose nor lipid metabolism in the low TSH group were different from baseline values.

- **Conclusion**: In summary, glucose and lipid metabolism in patients with DTC and long-term subclinical hyperthyroidism in general are no longer altered after restoration to euthyroidism.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^112uyPJK]. Thyroid (2016). Low credibility.

Thyrotoxicosis has multiple etiologies, manifestations, and potential therapies. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions and patient preference. This document describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of thyrotoxicosis that would be useful to generalist and subspecialty physicians and others providing care for patients with this condition.

- **Methods**: The American Thyroid Association (ATA) previously cosponsored guidelines for the management of thyrotoxicosis that were published in 2011. Considerable new literature has been published since then, and the ATA felt updated evidence-based guidelines were needed. The association assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this report. They examined relevant literature using a systematic PubMed search supplemented with additional published materials. An evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated the knowledge and experience of the panel was used to update the 2011 text and recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting them were rated according to the approach recommended by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Group.

- **Results**: Clinical topics addressed include the initial evaluation and management of thyrotoxicosis, management of Graves' hyperthyroidism using radioactive iodine, antithyroid drugs, or surgery, and management of toxic multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma using radioactive iodine or surgery. The guidelines also cover Graves' disease in children and adolescents.

### Levothyroxine replacement therapy and overuse: A timely diagnostic approach [^111XeNao]. Thyroid (2018). Low credibility.

Levothyroxine (LT4) is one of the most prescribed drugs worldwide. Once started, approximately 90% of patients continue treatment long-term. However, accumulating evidence suggests that many patients for whom the indication for its administration is not adequately established, and the diagnosis is not well documented, are overusing it. This study aimed to evaluate the necessity for and determine potential prognostic factors of long-term LT4 supplementation.

- **Methods**: A prospective clinical cohort follow-up study was carried out. In 291 subjects (84% females) aged 48 ± 16 years on LT4 replacement therapy without a solid diagnosis of hypothyroidism being provided, the treatment was paused. At the beginning and after six to eight weeks of treatment discontinuation, thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroxine levels were assessed, and thyroid ultrasound was performed. A TSH value of ≥ 4.5 IU/mL was considered indicative of underlying hypothyroidism.

- **Results**: Among the 291 individuals, 114 became hypothyroid (group A), while 177 subjects remained euthyroid off LT4 (group B; 39.2% vs. 60.8%, p < 0.001). The groups were comparable regarding sex, family history, age, body mass index, duration of treatment, basal TSH and free thyroxine values, thyroid volume, and presence of thyroid autoantibodies. However, diffuse inhomogeneous echogenicity on ultrasound examination was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in group A.

- **Conclusions**: These findings suggest considerable overuse of thyroxine therapy. The results underline the initial need to establish the diagnosis firmly before treatment initiation.

### Reversible diastolic dysfunction after long-term exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism: a randomized, placebo-controlled study [^114nNzVY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism has been reported to affect systolic and diastolic cardiac function; however, the reversibility of these effects is not well established.

- **Objective**: Our objective was to investigate the presence and reversibility of cardiac abnormalities in patients with long-term exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism.

- **Design**: We conducted a prospective, single-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial of 6 months' duration with two parallel groups.

- **Setting**: The study occurred at the Leiden University Medical Center, a tertiary referral center for thyroid carcinoma.

- **Patients**: As a model for subclinical hyperthyroidism, 25 patients with a history of differentiated thyroid carcinoma with more than 10 years of TSH suppressive therapy with L-T4 were studied.

- **Interventions**: L-T4 dose was replaced by study medication containing L-T4 or placebo. Medication was titrated in a single-blinded fashion to establish continuation of TSH suppression (low-TSH group) or euthyroidism (euthyroid group).

- **Measurements**: We assessed serum levels of free T4 and TSH and used echo Doppler cardiography, including tissue Doppler, to establish left ventricular (LV) dimensions and function as well as diastolic function. Baseline echocardiography data were compared with 24 controls.

- **Results**: There were no differences in baseline cardiac parameters and TSH levels between the two groups. Although the mean LV mass index was increased compared with 24 controls, only four patients had LV hypertrophy at baseline. This was not improved by the restoration of euthyroidism. At baseline, diastolic function abnormalities were present but not reversed after intervention.

### Time for a reassessment of the treatment of hypothyroidism [^113nGTgj]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Both the non-specific nature of complaints and inherent deficiencies in the diagnostic process raise an unsettling dilemma for patients and thyroid specialists alike. The issues are particularly pertinent to an etiological disease entity whose consequences are mirrored in similar outcomes: primary hypothyroidism due to total thyroidectomy in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer. Treatment requirements and dosing of the drug LT4 changed when guidelines relaxed the need for TSH-suppressive treatment targets for these patients. The reason for this shift was not primarily motivated by any improvement in the replacement strategy but by a revision of the long-held tenet that TSH may act as a thyroid growth stimulating hormone. Even when present at a low level in circulation, it was believed that it could potentially stimulate the growth of remaining tumor cells and thereby promote the relapse of thyroid cancer in the long term. This view has recently been revised, and TSH suppression is now deemed unnecessary for many thyroid cancer patients.

However, this remarkable strategy change has presented a unique opportunity to study the implications for patient complaints due to the far-reaching decision to abandon TSH-suppressive LT4 treatment in low-risk thyroid cancer. Although this could not be accomplished in a prospective study, careful retrospective analysis revealed some interesting trends. Over the years when replacement therapy aimed at complete TSH suppression, a relatively low rate of persistent hypothyroid complaints was reported by patients.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyperthyroidism, particularly in pediatric patients, the ATA 2016 guidelines recommend treating children with Graves' disease using methimazole, radioactive iodine therapy, or thyroidectomy. It is advised to avoid radioactive iodine therapy in very young children 150 µCi/g (5.55 MBq/g) of thyroid tissue, and for children between 5 and 10 years of age if the calculated radioactive iodine administered activity is less than 10 mCi (< 370 MBq). Thyroidectomy should be chosen when definitive therapy is required, the child is too young for radioactive iodine, and surgery can be performed by a high-volume thyroid surgeon.

### Optimal thyroid hormone replacement [^115a2k8B]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common endocrinopathy, and levothyroxine is frequently prescribed. Despite the basic tenets of initiating and adjusting levothyroxine being agreed on, there are many nuances and complexities to consistently maintaining euthyroidism. Understanding the impact of patient weight and residual thyroid function on initial levothyroxine dosage and consideration of age, comorbidities, thyrotropin goal, life stage, and quality of life as levothyroxine is adjusted can be challenging and continually evolving.

Because levothyroxine is a lifelong medication, it is important to avoid risks from periods of overtreatment or undertreatment. For the subset of patients not restored to baseline health with levothyroxine, causes arising from all aspects of the patient's life (coexistent medical conditions, stressors, lifestyle, psychosocial factors) should be broadly considered. If such factors do not appear to be contributing, and biochemical euthyroidism has been successfully maintained, there may be benefit to a trial of combination therapy with levothyroxine and liothyronine. This is not supported by the majority of randomized clinical trials but may be supported by other studies providing lower-quality evidence and by animal studies.

Given this discrepancy, it is important that any trial of combination therapy be continued only as long as a patient benefit is being enjoyed. Monitoring for adverse effects, particularly in older or frail individuals, is necessary and combination therapy should not be used during pregnancy. A sustained-release liothyronine preparation has

### Iatrogenic hypoparathyroidism development after thyroidectomy: A retrospective cohort study [^111cbk8U]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Our study is subject to certain limitations that warrant consideration. Firstly, the retrospective collection of data from a single centre introduces the potential for institutional bias and may limit the generalizability of our findings to other healthcare settings, as well as some instances of missing data, which could have influenced the completeness and accuracy of our analysis. Therefore, it is important to exercise caution when interpreting our results and extrapolating them to clinical practice.

In conclusion, our study has shed light on the critical factors that influence the occurrence and resolution of hypoparathyroidism following thyroidectomy. Our findings highlight the significant impact of surgical procedure type, biochemical parameters, and postoperative interventions. Of particular concern is the notable incidence of permanent hypoparathyroidism observed in our cohort. To gain a more comprehensive and robust understanding of this complication, further research conducted prospectively and involving multiple centres is warranted.

Furthermore, there is a pressing need to prioritize patient and clinician education regarding early symptom recognition and the importance of diligent postoperative monitoring. By enhancing awareness and implementing proactive measures, we can effectively mitigate the long-term consequences associated with hypoparathyroidism.

### Treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism and incident atrial fibrillation [^115tKe2Y]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

In treating overt hyperthyroidism, the prevention of atrial fibrillation (AF) is well established. However, while subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) has been associated with AF, it is uncertain if treatment of SH prevents the occurrence of AF.

Researchers aimed to explore the association between the treatment of SH and the incidence of AF through a pharmacoepidemiologic retrospective cohort study. Patients diagnosed with SH from 2000 to 2021 were followed.

Outpatients aged 18 years and older with biochemical SH, but without prior AF, hypothyroidism, thyroid cancer, pituitary disease, or pregnancy, were included in the study. The primary outcome was the incidence of AF, while secondary outcomes included ECG and echocardiographic features linked to AF.

From a screening of 2169 patients, 360 (131 treated and 229 untreated) were followed for an average of 4.27 years. In the treated group, AF was observed in 4 patients (3.1%), and in the untreated group, 15 patients (6.6%) experienced AF (p = 0.15). The incidence of AF was 0.8% per year in the treated group compared to 1.4% per year in the untreated group (p = 0.31). The hazard ratio (HR) for treatment as a time-dependent variable was 0.60 (95% CI 0.19–1.92; p = 0.39).

Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted, reclassifying two patients diagnosed with AF within 30 days of starting SH treatment to the untreated group. Results showed that in the treated and untreated groups, AF incidence fell to 1.6% and 7.4% (p = 0.02), respectively. The annual AF incidence was 0.4% in the treated group and 1.8% in the untreated group (p = 0.02), with an HR of 0.25 (0.06–1.13; p = 0.07). No differences in ECG or echocardiographic features were noted between the groups.

The study indicated an overall trend towards reduced AF incidence with SH treatment, although statistical significance was not achieved in all analyses and further studies are recommended.
