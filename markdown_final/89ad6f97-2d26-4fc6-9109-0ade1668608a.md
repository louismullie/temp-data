## Question

High-dose vitamin D therapy in myasthenia gravis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether high-dose vitamin D should be used in myasthenia gravis and what the evidence and safety considerations show about this practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether there are randomized trials or guideline endorsements specifically for high-dose vitamin D in MG. Then, I should verify if there is any indirect or mechanistic evidence that might justify such use. Next, I will evaluate safety signals and drug–disease or drug–drug interactions pertinent to MG patients. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, evidence-based recommendation within current MG standards of care, including how to manage vitamin D deficiency when present, and how to monitor if supplementation is used at replacement doses [^113ssjRj].

> Let me first confirm the direct evidence in MG. Wait, let me verify whether any randomized controlled trials or consensus MG guidelines endorse high-dose vitamin D as a disease-modifying therapy. I need to check across MGFA consensus and EFNS/ENS guidance and the primary literature for MG trials. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — my review shows no randomized trials of high-dose vitamin D for MG and no MG guideline recommends vitamin D as a disease-modifying or symptomatic treatment, which aligns with the absence of such recommendations in MGFA and EFNS/ENS documents, indicating that vitamin D is not part of MG immunotherapy algorithms [^113ssjRj] [^1135Ewja].

> Next, I should review any MG-specific but indirect evidence. The only MG study I see linking vitamin D to MG outcomes is a small pilot in which cholecalciferol 800 IU/day — not high-dose — was given to MG patients, showing improved fatigue and higher 25(OH)D after approximately 6 months, but this was uncontrolled, small, and used maintenance-range dosing rather than high-dose therapy, so the applicability to high-dose strategies is limited and at high risk of bias [^115MJgFV].

> Hold on, I should verify how MG guidelines mention vitamin D at all. I will now examine whether vitamin D appears in MG guidance in other contexts. MG guidance places vitamin D only in supportive care for steroid-treated patients to prevent osteoporosis, typically alongside calcium, and general bone-health guidance supports checking and repleting deficiency but does not suggest vitamin D alters MG disease activity, reinforcing its adjunctive, not disease-modifying, role in MG [^117QMcSZ] [^113zRN7e] [^117B6Wvh].

> Now, I need to ensure we understand safety if "high-dose" vitamin D is considered. Let me think about hypercalcemia and monitoring. High-dose active vitamin D analogs such as calcitriol can precipitate hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hyperphosphatemia, necessitating frequent monitoring and immediate discontinuation if hypercalcemia develops, and caution is needed with digitalis because hypercalcemia can trigger arrhythmias, all of which argue against empiric high-dose strategies without a clear indication and structured monitoring [^112Nbuvs] [^112Fktmf] [^117VAWkx].

> But wait, what if high vitamin D levels themselves worsen autoimmunity in some contexts. I should double-check preclinical data. In a CNS autoimmunity model, disproportionately high cholecalciferol intake leading to 25(OH)D above 200 nmol/L induced mild hypercalcemia and exacerbated disease via calcium-mediated proinflammatory T-cell activation, suggesting a biologically plausible harm signal at excessive vitamin D exposures, although this is in MS models and not MG, so translational caution is warranted rather than direct extrapolation [^114npqfW].

> Let me reconsider broader clinical data on high-dose vitamin D outside MG to calibrate expectations. The VIOLET RCT tested a single 540,000 IU loading dose of vitamin D3 in critically ill, deficient adults and found no mortality benefit, which doesn't answer MG-specific questions but does temper enthusiasm for empiric high-dose use to improve systemic outcomes without a targeted indication; contemporary endocrine guidance also highlights uncertainty about empiric high-dose vitamin D for disease prevention in the absence of a specific indication or deficiency, reinforcing a conservative approach [^113Raj3k] [^116sT4h1].

> Next, I should review the immunologic rationale but keep it in perspective. Vitamin D signaling can promote tolerogenic dendritic cells and enhance Treg function and, in MG ex vivo work, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 increased Treg suppressor activity, but these mechanistic signals have not translated into validated clinical efficacy for high-dose vitamin D in MG, and mechanistic plausibility alone is insufficient to justify high-dose therapy in the absence of clinical trials and with known hypercalcemic risks [^116MtQJ2] [^113257FP].

> Synthesizing all of this, I should confirm what is known and unknown. What we know: MG patients may be at risk of vitamin D deficiency, especially with chronic steroids, a small uncontrolled study with 800 IU/day suggested fatigue improvement, and MG guidelines position vitamin D for bone protection, not MG control. What we don't know: whether high-dose vitamin D improves MG strength, remission, or relapse rates, and the long-term safety of high-dose regimens in MG. Given potential harms from hypercalcemia and preclinical exacerbation signals at very high levels, the risk–benefit calculus does not favor high-dose vitamin D for MG disease modification at this time [^115MJgFV] [^117QMcSZ] [^112Nbuvs] [^114npqfW].

> Practically, I should confirm how to manage deficiency when present. Let me first confirm general endocrine guidance. If 25(OH)D is low, replete per established deficiency guidelines rather than MG-specific disease-modifying intent: typical adult repletion uses cholecalciferol with loading and maintenance strategies individualized to risk factors like obesity or malabsorption, and ongoing maintenance commonly ranges 800–2000 IU/day for bone health, with serum calcium monitoring as needed and additional calcium in steroid-treated patients to prevent osteoporosis, reserving higher repletion doses for clear deficiency contexts with appropriate monitoring rather than for MG symptom control [^114tvLJq] [^115rP1Fz] [^113zRN7e] [^117QMcSZ].

> Finally, I need to ensure the recommendation aligns with MG standards of care. MG symptom and disease control should rely on evidence-based therapies: pyridostigmine as initial symptomatic treatment, corticosteroids when needed, addition of nonsteroidal immunosuppressants for steroid-sparing or inadequate response, short-term IVIG or plasma exchange in crisis or severe bulbar/respiratory involvement, and targeted biologics such as FcRn inhibitors or complement inhibitors for appropriate patients, while recognizing that high-dose corticosteroids can rarely precipitate acute myopathy in disorders of neuromuscular transmission and should be titrated carefully, and that vitamin D remains adjunctive for bone health rather than a disease-modifying MG therapy [^113ssjRj] [^112Fht4Q] [^114XisZB] [^116Bf541] [^111u5TPs] [^111gAXMi].

High-dose vitamin D is not recommended for myasthenia gravis because there is **no clinical evidence** of benefit and **significant risks** of hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and renal impairment [^112Nbuvs] [^112Fktmf]. MG guidelines do not include **vitamin D as therapy** [^115tWNob]; standard care remains pyridostigmine, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressants [^113ssjRj] [^112Fht4Q]. Vitamin D should be used only to correct **deficiency** [^114tvLJq], with monitoring of serum calcium and 25(OH)D levels to avoid toxicity [^113zRN7e].

---

## Evidence for high-dose vitamin D supplementation in MG

Clinical evidence does not support **high-dose vitamin D for MG**, and current **guidelines** do not recommend it as therapy [^113ssjRj].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of high-dose vitamin D supplementation

High-dose vitamin D supplementation carries **significant risks**, particularly in patients with autoimmune disorders such as MG:

- **Hypercalcemia**: Excessive vitamin D intake can cause hypercalcemia, leading to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, weakness, and confusion [^112Nbuvs].

- **Hypercalciuria**: Elevated calcium levels can result in hypercalciuria, increasing the risk of kidney stones and renal impairment.

- **Renal impairment**: High-dose vitamin D supplementation can cause renal impairment, particularly in patients with pre-existing kidney conditions [^112Nbuvs].

- **Cardiac arrhythmias**: Hypercalcemia induced by high-dose vitamin D supplementation can precipitate cardiac arrhythmias, especially in patients on digitalis therapy [^112Fktmf].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines for MG management **do not include vitamin D supplementation** as a standard treatment [^113ssjRj]:

- **Pyridostigmine**: Recommended as initial symptomatic therapy for MG [^115tWNob] [^111WPcn9].

- **Corticosteroids**: Recommended for patients who do not achieve treatment goals with pyridostigmine alone [^112Fht4Q] [^114GeJBr] [^1123ddQ1].

- **Immunosuppressive agents**: Azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and other immunosuppressants are recommended for long-term management of MG [^112Fht4Q] [^116DCiuU] [^112MgmuD].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

High-dose vitamin D supplementation is **not recommended** for patients with MG because efficacy is unproven and there are significant risks of hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and renal impairment [^112Nbuvs] [^112Fktmf]. Current clinical guidelines do not include vitamin D supplementation as standard treatment for MG [^113ssjRj]. Therefore, vitamin D should be used only to correct deficiency, with careful monitoring of serum calcium and 25(OH)D levels to avoid toxicity [^114tvLJq] [^113zRN7e].

### Calcitriol [^112Nbuvs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Overdosage**: Administration of calcitriol to patients in excess of their daily requirements can cause hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hyperphosphatemia. Since calcitriol is a derivative of vitamin D, the signs and symptoms of overdose are the same as for an overdose of vitamin D (see adverse reactions). High intake of calcium and phosphate concomitant with calcitriol may lead to similar abnormalities. The serum calcium times phosphate (Ca x P) product should not be allowed to exceed 70 mg^2/dL^2. High levels of calcium in the dialysate bath may contribute to hypercalcemia (see warnings).

- **Treatment of hypercalcemia and overdosage in dialysis patients and hypoparathyroidism patients**: General treatment of hypercalcemia (greater than 1 mg/dL above the upper limit of the normal range) consists of immediate discontinuation of calcitriol therapy, institution of a low-calcium diet, and withdrawal of calcium supplements. Serum calcium levels should be determined daily until normocalcemia ensues. Hypercalcemia frequently resolves in 2 to 7 days. When serum calcium levels have returned to within normal limits, calcitriol therapy may be reinstituted at a dose of 0.25 mcg/day less than prior therapy. Serum calcium levels should be obtained at least twice weekly after all dosage changes and subsequent dosage titration. In dialysis patients, persistent or markedly elevated serum calcium levels may be corrected by dialysis against a calcium-free dialysate.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: Executive summary [^113ssjRj]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Symptomatic and immunosuppressive (IS) treatment of myasthenia gravis (MG).

1. Pyridostigmine should be part of the initial treatment in most patients with MG. The dose of pyridostigmine should be adjusted as needed based on symptoms. The ability to discontinue pyridostigmine can indicate that the patient has met treatment goals and may guide the tapering of other therapies. Corticosteroids or IS therapy should be used in all patients with MG who have not met treatment goals after an adequate trial of pyridostigmine.

2. A nonsteroidal IS agent should be used alone when corticosteroids are contraindicated or refused. A nonsteroidal IS agent should be used initially in conjunction with corticosteroids when the risk of steroid side effects is high based on medical comorbidities. A nonsteroidal IS agent should be added to corticosteroids when:
	- Steroid side effects, deemed significant by the patient or the treating physician, develop.
	- Response to an adequate trial of corticosteroids is inadequate.
	- The corticosteroid dose cannot be reduced due to symptom relapse.

3. Nonsteroidal IS agents that can be used in MG include azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, and tacrolimus. The following factors should be considered in selecting among these agents:
	- There is widespread variation in practice with respect to the choice of IS agent since there is little literature comparing them.
	- Expert consensus and some randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence support the use of azathioprine as a first-line IS agent in MG.
	- Evidence from RCTs supports the use of cyclosporine in MG, but potential serious adverse effects should be considered.

### Calcitriol [^112Fktmf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Excessive dosage of calcitriol injection induces hypercalcemia and, in some instances, hypercalciuria. Therefore, early in treatment during dosage adjustment, serum calcium and phosphorus should be determined at least twice weekly. Should hypercalcemia develop, the drug should be discontinued immediately. Calcitriol injection should be given cautiously to patients on digitalis, because hypercalcemia in such patients may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias.

Patients and their parents should be informed about adherence to instructions regarding diet and calcium supplementation. They should also be advised to avoid the use of unapproved non-prescription drugs, including magnesium-containing antacids. Additionally, patients should be carefully informed about the symptoms of hypercalcemia.

- **Essential laboratory tests**: Serum calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, and 24-hour urinary calcium and phosphorus should be determined periodically. During the initial phase of medication, serum calcium and phosphorus should be determined more frequently (twice weekly). Adynamic bone disease may develop if PTH levels are suppressed to abnormal levels. If a biopsy is not being conducted for other diagnostic reasons, PTH levels may be used to indicate the rate of bone turnover. If PTH levels fall below the recommended target range (1.5 to 3 times the upper limit of normal) in patients treated with calcitriol injection, the calcitriol injection dose should be reduced or therapy discontinued. Discontinuation of calcitriol therapy may result in rebound issues.

Regarding medical management for myasthenia gravis, specifically concerning acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, the MGFA 2016 guidelines recommend administering pyridostigmine as part of the initial treatment in most patients with MG. Adjust the pyridostigmine dose as needed, based on symptoms. Recognize that the ability to discontinue pyridostigmine can be an indicator that the patient has met treatment goals and may guide the tapering of other therapies.

### National osteoporosis society vitamin D guideline summary [^113zRN7e]. Age and Ageing (2014). Low credibility.

The National Osteoporosis Society (NOS) published its document, *Vitamin D and Bone Health: A Practical Clinical Guideline for Patient Management*, in 2013 as a practical clinical guideline on the management of vitamin D deficiency in adult patients with, or at risk of developing, bone disease. There has been no clear consensus in the UK on vitamin D deficiency, its assessment, and treatment, leading to inconsistent clinical practice. This guideline is aimed at clinicians, including doctors, nurses, and dieticians.

- **Clinical scenarios**: It recommends the measurement of serum 25(OH) vitamin D (25OHD) to estimate vitamin D status in specific clinical scenarios:
	- Bone diseases that may be improved with vitamin D treatment.
	- Bone diseases, prior to specific treatment where correcting vitamin D deficiency is appropriate.
	- Musculoskeletal symptoms that could be attributed to vitamin D deficiency.

- **Routine testing**: The guideline states that routine vitamin D testing is unnecessary where vitamin D supplementation with an oral antiresorptive treatment is already planned. It sets the following serum 25OHD thresholds: 50 nmol/l is sufficient for almost the whole population.

- **Treatment**: Oral vitamin D3 is recommended with fixed loading doses of oral vitamin D3 followed by regular maintenance therapy when rapid correction of vitamin D deficiency is required. However, loading doses are not necessary where correction of deficiency is less urgent or when co-prescribing with an oral antiresorptive agent.

- **Monitoring**: For monitoring, serum calcium (adjusted for albumin) should be assessed to ensure proper management of vitamin D levels.

Vitamin D, adaptive immunity, and autoimmunity

Preclinical data

We have known since the 1980s that the vitamin D receptor (VDR) is present in T lymphocytes and that 1,25(OH)2D is an inhibitor of T cell proliferation and activation. T lymphocytes are composed of several subsets, including CD4+ helper T cells, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, regulatory T (Treg) cells, natural killer cells, γδ T cells, and memory cells. The effects of vitamin D signaling on T cell subtypes have been reviewed extensively elsewhere. In general terms, vitamin D acts to suppress T cell–driven inflammation and enhance the effects of suppressive Treg cells.

The communication between antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells appears to be particularly important in this regard. The intracrine production of 1,25(OH)2D induces a more tolerogenic DC phenotype, characterized by the production of IL-10, which stimulates the production of Treg cells. Recent studies have suggested that 1,25(OH)2D controls the phenotype of DCs by altering their metabolic profile. These anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D signaling on DCs and T cells have stimulated extensive interest in the relationship between vitamin D status, inflammation, and autoimmunity. In autoimmune diabetes-prone NOD mice, vitamin D deficiency early in life (with normal intake later on) substantially and highly significantly increased the subsequent risk of disease in two independent studies. In other work, dietary 1,25(OH)2D reduced arthritic lesions in two mouse models of autoimmune arthritis, murine Lyme arthritis, and collagen-induced arthritis.

### Treatment of refractory myasthenia: "rebooting" with high-dose cyclophosphamide [^114A6pHs]. Annals of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) who do not respond to conventional immunotherapeutic agents or cannot tolerate their side effects are considered "refractory". Ablation of the immune system followed by bone marrow transplant has been shown to cure experimental MG in rats. It is now known that immunoablative treatment with high-dose cyclophosphamide does not damage hematopoietic "stem cells", thus permitting repopulation of the immune system without a bone marrow transplant. Recent evidence indicates that this treatment can induce durable remissions in autoimmune diseases.

We treated three myasthenic patients, for whom treatment with thymectomy, plasmapheresis, and conventional immunotherapeutic agents failed, by using high-dose cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg/day intravenously for 4 days) followed by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. All three patients tolerated the treatment well and have shown marked improvement in myasthenic weakness, allowing for a reduction of immunosuppressive medication to minimal levels. Acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody levels decreased in two AChR antibody-positive patients, and anti-MuSK antibody levels decreased in one "AChR antibody-negative" patient. The patients have been followed for up to 3.5 years, with no recurrence of symptoms. High-dose cyclophosphamide treatment appears to be an effective and safe treatment for selected patients with refractory MG. Further follow-up of these and additional patients will be needed to determine whether the benefit is durable.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114tvLJq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is a condition that can be associated with various health issues, including malabsorption, increased serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), bariatric surgery, and corticosteroid use. It can lead to symptoms such as bone pain, myalgia, muscle weakness, and conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rickets, osteopenia, and osteoporosis. Additional associated factors include a history of fracture, bowed legs, decreased serum calcium, hip pain, pectus carinatum, kyphosis, reduced serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, chronic kidney disease (CKD), anticonvulsant use, limited sun exposure, and having a dark skin color.

### Early high-dose vitamin D for critically ill, vitamin D-deficient patients [^113Raj3k]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). High credibility.

The study "VIOLET (high-dose vitamin D)" was published by National Heart and colleagues in 2019 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to critical illness and vitamin D deficiency. The trial question was: What is the effect of early high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation in critically ill, vitamin D-deficient patients?

- **Study design**: The VIOLET study was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).
- **Population**: The study included 1078 patients (467 female and 611 male). The inclusion criteria were critically ill, vitamin D-deficient patients at high risk for death.
- **Key exclusion criteria**: An inability to take an enteral drug, a history of kidney stones, the presence of hypercalcemia at baseline, and informed consent not being obtained in a timely manner.
- **Interventions**:
	- **Vitamin D**: n = 538 received a single enteral dose of 540,000 IU of vitamin D3 in liquid form, administered within 2 hours after randomization.
	- **Placebo**: n = 540 received a matched placebo in liquid form, administered within 2 hours after randomization.
- **Primary outcome**: There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality at 90 days (23.5% vs. 20.6%; AD 2.9%, 95% CI -2.1 to 7.9).
- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in in-hospital mortality at 90 days (17.1% vs. 13.4%; AD 3.7%, 95% CI -0.5 to 8).
	- Borderline significant decrease in hospital length of stay.

### Guidelines for treatment of autoimmune neuromuscular transmission disorders [^1135Ewja]. European Journal of Neurology (2010). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for myasthenia gravis, specifically with respect to immunosuppressants, EFNS 2010 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of immunosuppressive agents in all patients with progressive MG symptoms. It is important to recognize that patients with a thymoma and other patients with anti-titin and anti-RyR antibodies usually have a severe disease, requiring more aggressive treatment strategies.

### Clinical practice guidelines for sustained neuromuscular blockade in the adult critically ill patient [^1125x9HA]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Regarding perioperative care for myasthenia gravis, particularly in relation to neuromuscular blockade, the SCCM 2016 guidelines recommend administering a reduced dose of a neuromuscular blocking agent, based on peripheral nerve stimulation with train-of-four monitoring, in patients with MG.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: Executive summary [^112ArZmf]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Management of myasthenia gravis (MG) in pregnancy involves critical planning to ensure optimal clinical outcomes for both the mother and fetus.

1. Planning for pregnancy should be instituted well in advance to allow time for optimization of myasthenic clinical status and to minimize risks to the fetus.

2. Multidisciplinary communication among relevant specialists should occur throughout pregnancy, during delivery, and in the postpartum period.

3. Provided that their myasthenia is under good control before pregnancy, the majority of women can be reassured that they will remain stable throughout pregnancy. If worsening occurs, it may be more likely during the first few months after delivery.

4. Oral pyridostigmine is the first-line treatment during pregnancy. Intravenous cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) may produce uterine contractions and should not be used during pregnancy.

5. Thymectomy should be postponed until after pregnancy as benefit is unlikely to occur during pregnancy.

6. Chest CT without contrast can be performed safely during pregnancy, although the risks of radiation to the fetus need to be carefully considered. Unless there is a compelling indication, postponement of diagnostic CT until after delivery is preferable.

7. Prednisone is the immunosuppressive (IS) agent of choice during pregnancy.

8. Information indicates that azathioprine and cyclosporine are relatively safe in expectant mothers who are not satisfactorily controlled with or cannot tolerate corticosteroids. Evidence indicates that mycophenolate mofetil and methotrexate increase the risk of teratogenicity and are contraindicated during pregnancy. These agents previously carried Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Category C (cyclosporine) and Category D (azathioprine).

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^111TsKkR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, specifically with respect to vitamin D requirements, the ES 2011 guidelines recommend advising at least 2–3 times more vitamin D intake for their age group. This is to satisfy the body's vitamin D requirements in adults with obesity or those on medications such as anticonvulsants, corticosteroids, antifungals like ketoconazole, and AIDS medications.

### Calcitriol [^112rZ77J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Calcitriol injection is intended for intravenous administration only. The optimal dose of calcitriol injection must be carefully determined for each patient, ensuring that each is receiving an adequate and appropriate daily intake of calcium, with the recommended dietary allowance for adults being 800 mg. Physicians should either prescribe a calcium supplement or instruct patients in proper dietary measures to ensure adequate calcium intake.

The recommended initial dose of calcitriol injection, depending on the severity of hypocalcemia and/or secondary hyperparathyroidism, is between 1 mcg (0.02 mcg/kg) and 2 mcg, administered intravenously three times weekly, approximately every other day. Initial doses can range from as small as 0.5 mcg to as large as 4 mcg three times weekly. If a satisfactory response is not observed, the dose may be increased by 0.5 to 1 mcg at two- to four-week intervals.

During the titration period, it is crucial to obtain serum calcium and phosphorus levels at least twice weekly. Should hypercalcemia or a serum calcium times phosphate product greater than 70 occur, the drug should be immediately discontinued until these parameters normalize. Once stabilized, calcitriol injection may be reinitiated at a lower dose. As PTH levels decrease in response to therapy, dose adjustments may be necessary. Thus, incremental dosing must be individualized and in line with PTH, serum calcium, and phosphorus levels.

### Vitamin D deficiency in patients with myasthenia gravis and improvement of fatigue after supplementation of vitamin D3: A pilot study [^115MJgFV]. European Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disorder. Vitamin D plays significant roles in both the autoimmune response and skeletal muscles. This study determined the levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] in patients with MG and healthy subjects to evaluate whether vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in MG and if vitamin D supplementation has a beneficial effect on fatigue.

- **Methods**: Plasma levels of 25(OH)D were analyzed in 33 patients with MG (22 males; mean age, 58 years) and in 50 healthy age- and sex-matched blood donors without vitamin D3 medication. The MG composite (MGC) score was used to assess fatigue. Thirteen patients with MG, who had not previously received vitamin D3 supplementation, were started on vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 800 IU/day, with follow-up examinations conducted after 2.5 to 10 months (mean, 6 months).

- **Results**: Patients with MG without pre-existing vitamin D3 supplementation (N = 16) had a mean MGC score of 4.5 and lower plasma 25(OH)D levels (mean, 51 ± 19 nM) compared to healthy controls (69 ± 21 nM) (P = 0.017). Seventeen patients with pre-existing vitamin D3 supplementation, due to corticosteroid treatment, had a mean 25(OH)D level of 79 ± 22 nM and a mean MGC score of 5.5. Among the 13 patients who received cholecalciferol, 25(OH)D levels increased by 22% (P = 0.033) at follow-up and the MGC score improved by 38% (P = 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: Plasma 25(OH)D levels are significantly lower in patients with MG compared to healthy controls. Given that vitamin D has beneficial effects on the autoimmune response and on the fatigue score in patients with MG, we suggest monitoring levels.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^111U4Jbv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for vitamin D deficiency, particularly concerning pregnant patients, the ES 2024 guidelines recommend considering empiric vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy. This supplementation may potentially lower the risk of preeclampsia, intra-uterine mortality, preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age birth, and neonatal mortality.

### Early fast-acting treatment strategy against generalized myasthenia gravis [^11313Uxi]. Muscle & Nerve (2017). Low credibility.

- **Kaplan–Meier curves**: The Kaplan–Meier curves for first achievement of the treatment target (minimal manifestations or better-5mg for ≥ 6 months) are shown for both groups under the early fast-acting treatment (EFT) with low- and high-dose prednisolone (PSL) regimens.

- **Cumulative hazard curves**: Figure 3B illustrates the time courses of the baseline cumulative hazard curves for both the low-dose and high-dose PSL groups as a function of time. This figure excludes the effects of covariables. Although the baseline cumulative hazard levels in the high-dose PSL group appeared to eventually rise to the same level as those in the low-dose PSL group at 60 months after starting immune therapy, this difference was not statistically significant.

### Initial treatment response in ocular myasthenia gravis: A comparison between low and moderate doses of prednisolone [^1118hKcM]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

Treatment recommendations in ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG) are generally based on low-level evidence guidelines from clinical experiences, expert opinions, and consensus reports. Further prospective and randomized controlled studies to compare the efficacy of low-dose and moderate-dose prednisolone are encouraged to confirm our results. These studies could lead to a new standard treatment guideline being established to address this disease with optimism, maximize therapeutic responses, and minimize adverse events.

### Efficacy of perioperative high-dose prednisolone therapy during thymectomy in myasthenia gravis patients [^112CBsun]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

This study aimed to investigate the benefits of administering perioperative high-dose prednisolone in conjunction with thymectomy in patients with myasthenia gravis.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed data from patients with Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America Clinical Class I to IIIB who had undergone an extended thymectomy between 1992 and 2009. Perioperative high-dose prednisolone was administered at starting doses of 10 to 20 mg and escalated up to 100 mg on alternate days. The treatment group comprised 70 patients receiving perioperative high-dose prednisolone, whereas the control group included 61 patients not treated with preoperative steroids. The two groups were compared with respect to baseline clinical characteristics, incidence of postoperative complications, and follow-up disease status.

- **Results**: Prednisolone-treated patients presented with more advanced disease compared to controls (Class IIB or greater, 42 [60.0%] versus 7 [11.3%], respectively; P < 0.001). Mean preoperative %FVC was lower and FEV1.0% was higher in treated patients than in controls (%FVC: 92.4 ± 2.3% versus 99.5 ± 2.4%, respectively; P = 0.037, FEV1.0%: 85.2 ± 1.3% versus 81.4 ± 0.9%, respectively; P = 0.017). The groups were similar in other variables, including the presence of thymoma and operative procedure. In the treatment group, disease status was significantly improved only by the induction of high-dose prednisolone before the surgery (P < 0.001), and these patients discontinued anti-cholinesterase therapy more frequently than controls (P < 0.001).

### Safety and efficacy of zilucoplan in patients with generalised myasthenia gravis (RAISE): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study [^111u5TPs]. The Lancet Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Generalised myasthenia gravis is a chronic, unpredictable, and debilitating rare disease, often accompanied by a high treatment burden, with an unmet need for more efficacious and well-tolerated treatments. Zilucoplan is a subcutaneous, self-administered macrocyclic peptide complement C5 inhibitor. We aimed to assess the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of zilucoplan in patients with acetylcholine receptor autoantibody (AChR)-positive generalised myasthenia gravis.

- **Methods**: RAISE was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial conducted at 75 sites in Europe, Japan, and North America. We enrolled patients aged 18–74 years with AChR-positive generalised myasthenia gravis (Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America disease class II-IV), a myasthenia gravis activities of daily living (MG-ADL) score of at least 6, and a quantitative myasthenia gravis score of at least 12. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive subcutaneous zilucoplan 0.3 mg/kg once daily by self-injection or a matched placebo for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to week 12 in the MG-ADL score in the modified intention-to-treat population (all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of the study drug and had at least one post-dosing MG-ADL score). Safety was mainly assessed by the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in all patients who had received at least one dose of zilucoplan or placebo. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04115293. An open-label extension study is ongoing (NCT04225871).

### Clinical features, pathogenesis, and treatment of myasthenia gravis: A supplement to the guidelines of the German neurological society [^117QMcSZ]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

The number and severity of side effects of glucocorticoids (GCS) increase with the duration and cumulative dosage. Especially patients with other comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus, are at special risk. In cases where the estimated therapy duration is longer than 3 months using a dosage of > 7.5 mg prednisolone equivalent, patients should be treated with calcium (1000–1500 mg/d) and vitamin D (400–800 IE/d) to prevent osteoporosis. Vitamin D levels should be determined prior to the initiation of such therapy and controlled throughout. In post-menopausal women, bisphosphonates can be used to prevent GCS-induced osteoporosis. The evidence for the prophylactic effect of bisphosphonates against GCS-induced osteoporosis and bone fractures in men is currently insufficient for a general recommendation. Moreover, stomach protection using proton-pump inhibitors or other drugs may be warranted.

To reduce side effects, some centers switch from daily to alternate-day oral GCS treatment during long-term application in the low-dose range, the usefulness of which needs to be validated in individual patients as long as systematic data are lacking.

- **Azathioprine**: Azathioprine (AZA) is the most frequently used immunosuppressive agent for the treatment of myasthenia gravis (MG). Azathioprine is a purine analogue that is metabolized rapidly to the cytotoxic and immunosuppressant derivatives 6-mercaptopurine and thioinosinic acid. The latter inhibits purine synthesis, thus impairing activation and proliferation and causing apoptosis of T cells and B cells due to their lack of metabolic pathways for nucleotide salvage ('recycling').

### New and emerging treatments for myasthenia gravis [^111nDSvb]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The role of eculizumab in AChR+ gMG is still being determined and currently, this treatment tends to be reserved for those with refractory symptoms. Because patients receiving eculizumab have shown benefit as early as one week after the start of treatment, it might eventually have a role in treating myasthenia gravis crisis.

An unwanted complication of complement inhibition is a greatly increased risk of infection caused by encapsulated bacteria, particularly Neisseria meningitidis. Patients receiving complement inhibitors should receive double meningococcal vaccination with ACYW conjugate and serogroup B vaccine at least two weeks before the first drug infusion. Antibiotic prophylaxis is mandatory if the drug is started within two weeks of vaccination.

Ravulizumab is a long-acting C5 complement inhibitor engineered over the backbone of eculizumab. The phase 3 CHAMPION (Safety and Efficacy Study of Ravulizumab in Adults With Generalised Myasthenia Gravis) study evaluating the safety and efficacy of ravulizumab in patients with AChR+ gMG showed significant improvement in the total score on the MG-ADL scale (P < 0.001) and in the quantitative myasthenia gravis score from baseline to week 26 (P < 0.001) compared with placebo. The benefits were seen within one week after the start of treatment and were sustained up to week 26. Ravulizumab is well tolerated and has the benefit of dosing every eight weeks, compared with every two weeks for eculizumab. The FDA approved its use for the treatment of AChR+ gMG in April 2022.

Zilucoplan is a small 15 amino acid macrocyclic peptide.

### Early fast-acting treatment strategy against generalized myasthenia gravis [^114qDxns]. Muscle & Nerve (2017). Low credibility.

Among patients who underwent early fast-acting treatment (EFT), there were at least two distinct types of dosing regimens used for the combined oral prednisone (PSL).

- **Differences in dosing regimens**: In the patient group treated with EFT combined with a low-dose PSL regimen, improvements in myasthenia gravis (MG) symptoms associated with living difficulties were mainly due to the use of fast-acting therapy sets starting during the early stages of treatment. The use of low-dose (≤ 10 mg/day) oral PSL as maintenance therapy was notable. If symptoms worsened during follow-up, patients were readmitted for a shorter treatment period of 2–7 days, during which they underwent further fast-acting therapy sets (1 or 2 times). In the majority of patients, it was unnecessary to increase the dose of oral PSL, and patients treated with oral PSL ≥ 20 mg/day for more than three months were excluded from this category.

- **High-dose regimen**: In the patient group treated with EFT combined with a high-dose PSL regimen, MG symptoms associated with living difficulties were improved by both fast-acting therapy sets and high-dose oral PSL. The steroids were often given using a dose-escalation schedule until symptoms sufficiently improved or a maximum dose of 50–60 mg/day was reached. The treatments were maintained at the highest dose required, after which doses were tapered.

### Vitamin D supplementation and COVID-19 treatment: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115dMKWA]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is an immune modulator which might be linked to disease severity by SARS-CoV-2.

- **Methods**: A meta-analysis of RCTs and quasi-experimental studies evaluated the role of vitamin D supplementation in COVID-19 patients.

- **Results**: A total of five studies (three RCTs and two quasi-experimental) including 467 patients were analyzed. Vitamin D did not reduce mortality (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.39, p = 0.21), ICU admission rates (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01–4.26, p = 0.3), and the need for invasive ventilation (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.01–7.89, p = 0.42).

- **Conclusion**: No significant difference was observed with vitamin D supplementation on major health-related outcomes in COVID-19. Well-designed RCTs are required to further address this topic.

### Oral corticosteroid dosing regimen and long-term prognosis in generalised myasthenia gravis: a multicentre cross-sectional study in Japan [^111n74fG]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Long-term full remission without treatment is uncommon in myasthenia gravis (MG). Only less than 10% of patients with MG achieve the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) postintervention status of complete stable remission (CSR). Therefore, treatment strategies should consider the probability of prolonged treatment and aim for maintaining health-related quality of life (QOL) and mental health. The recent international consensus guidance for management of MG proposes minimal manifestation (MM) status or better as a goal for the treatment of MG. Our research group has also proposed that MM status or better with prednisolone (PSL) 5 mg/day or lower (MM-or-better-5mg) may be a more practical treatment goal than CSR and achievable by more patients. It has been suggested that this goal yields patient satisfaction essentially equivalent to CSR based on patients' QOL.

Among the various immunosuppressive therapies, oral corticosteroids remain the most common agent used for long-term immunosuppression in the management of MG. In traditional therapy, oral corticosteroids have been used at high doses in an escalation and de-escalation fashion. However, there are no reported data supporting the claim that treatment with high-dose oral steroids increases the rate of complete remission in MG, and epidemiological research shows no change in complete remission rate before and after the use of oral steroids became widespread. Many patients continue to have impaired QOL because of insufficient improvement and long-term steroid-related adverse effects. Furthermore, our previous survey showed that higher PSL dosages are associated with a greater incidence of adverse effects while not necessarily improving remission rates.

### Regulatory function of CD4+CD25++ T cells in patients with myasthenia gravis is associated with phenotypic changes and STAT5 signaling: 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 modulates the suppressor activity [^113257FP]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2015). Low credibility.

Regulatory T cells were investigated in early-onset (EO) and late-onset (LO) myasthenia gravis patients with anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody (AChR-MG). Alterations in PD-1 and PD-L1 on CD4(+)CD25(++) Treg and responder T cells (Tresp, CD4(+)CD25(-)) were observed in LOMG patients. GITR was decreased on CD4(+)CD25(++) of all patients. Decrease of FOXP3 was associated with lower phosphorylation of STAT5. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VitD3) increased suppression in co-culture with a stronger effect in patients by acting possibly both on cell groups. Changes in surface molecules and intracellular pathways contribute to the defects of Treg in non-thymomatous AChR-MG, and VitD3 can have modulatory effects.

### Oral corticosteroid dosing regimen and long-term prognosis in generalised myasthenia gravis: a multicentre cross-sectional study in Japan [^115JrqXQ]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Maximum severity, achievement of status, and other treatments in three groups classified by oral PSL dosing regimen were assessed. Pearson's Χ² test revealed a significantly higher percentage of patients with maximum severity in the high-dose group compared to the other two groups (P < 0.0001). ANOVA, followed by the Tukey-Kramer test, also showed that the worst QMG score for the entire disease period was significantly higher in the high-dose group (18.6 ± 7.9) than in the intermediate-dose group (14.4 ± 6.4) or the low-dose group (13.9 ± 6.3) (P < 0.0001).

The proportion of patients who maintained MM-or-better-5mg for ≥ 6 months was significantly higher in the low-dose group than in the intermediate-dose or high-dose group during the 3 years after treatment started (P < 0.0001). Specifically, 52.1% of the low-dose group maintained this status after 1 year of treatment, compared to 11.4% in the intermediate-dose group or 9.6% in the high-dose group; after 2 years, these figures were 61.2% vs 30.8% or 29.9%; and after 3 years, 64.1% vs 36.4% or 44.1%. Patients in the high-dose group received a smaller cumulative HMP dose compared with patients in the low-dose group (12.9 ± 25.8 vs 23.1 ± 37.8 g, P = 0.01).

Treatment with PE/PP was significantly less frequent in the intermediate-dose group (30.3%) than in the high-dose group (43.7%) or the low-dose group (40.7%) (P = 0.02). The rates of combined early follow-up treatment (EFT) and early combined use of CNIs starting within 6 months of treatment were significantly different: 31.4% in the high-dose group vs 39.8% in the intermediate-dose group vs 53.6% in the low-dose group for EFT, and 12.2% in the high-dose group vs 29.8% in the intermediate-dose group vs 47.1% in the low-dose group for CNI use.

### Low and high doses of ursolic acid ameliorate experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis through different pathways [^111cskEH]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2015). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease characterized by fatigable muscle weakness. Ursolic acid (UA) is a pentacyclic triterpenoid with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, especially inhibiting IL-17. We found that UA ameliorated the symptoms of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG), a rat model of MG. Although both the low and high doses of UA shifted Th17 to Th2 cytokines, other mechanisms were dose dependent. The low dose enhanced Fas-mediated apoptosis, whereas the high dose up-regulated Treg cells and reduced the concentrations of IgG2b antibodies. These findings suggest a new strategy to treat EAMG and even human MG.

### In adults with clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of MS, high-dose vitamin D monotherapy reduced disease activity at 2 y [^1127D2hW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

- **Clinical impact ratings**: The study holds particular significance in the fields of general internal medicine (GIM), family practice (FP), general practice (GP), and neurology.

The research suggests that high-dose vitamin D monotherapy may play a role in reducing disease activity for patients over a 2-year period. This intervention could potentially alter the standard approach to managing clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS). Adjustments to clinical practices based on the latest findings could benefit patient outcomes significantly, making the work notable for its practical implications.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^116sT4h1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Numerous studies demonstrate associations between serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) and a variety of common disorders, including musculoskeletal, metabolic, cardiovascular, malignant, autoimmune, and infectious diseases. Although a causal link between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and many disorders has not been clearly established, these associations have led to widespread supplementation with vitamin D and increased laboratory testing for 25(OH)D in the general population. The benefit-risk ratio of this increase in vitamin D use is not clear, and the optimal vitamin D intake and the role of testing for 25(OH)D for disease prevention remain uncertain.

- **Objective**: To develop clinical guidelines for the use of vitamin D (cholecalciferol [vitamin D3] or ergocalciferol [vitamin D2]) to lower the risk of disease in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing.

- **Methods**: A multidisciplinary panel of clinical experts, along with experts in guideline methodology and systematic literature review, identified and prioritized 14 clinically relevant questions related to the use of vitamin D and 25(OH)D testing to lower the risk of disease. The panel prioritized randomized placebo-controlled trials in general populations (without an established indication for vitamin D treatment or 25[OH]D testing), evaluating the effects of empiric vitamin D administration throughout the lifespan, as well as in select conditions (pregnancy and prediabetes).

The panel defined "empiric supplementation" as vitamin D intake that is administered without prior testing to establish deficiency. The discussion and analysis provided by the panel aimed to offer guidance on vitamin D usage and its testing's role in preventive healthcare practices.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: Executive summary [^115vXcS7]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Acquired myasthenia gravis (MG) is a disorder of neuromuscular transmission resulting from the binding of autoantibodies to components of the neuromuscular junction, most commonly the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). The incidence ranges from 0.3 to 2.8 per 100,000, and it is estimated to affect more than 700,000 people worldwide.

The increasing use of immunomodulating therapies has been a major factor in improving the prognosis for patients with MG in recent years. The various treatment options must be weighed in the context of individual patient factors.

The study, Vivacity-MG3, was published in 2025 in The Lancet Neurology. This study investigates the effect of nipocalimab in patients with generalized myasthenia gravis.

- **Study design**: The Vivacity-MG3 was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

- **Population**: The trial included 153 patients, with 92 females and 61 males. Inclusion criteria were adult patients with generalized myasthenia gravis inadequately controlled with standard-of-care therapy.

- **Key exclusion criteria**: These included clinical immunodeficiency syndrome unrelated to the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis, a family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency unless confirmed absent in the patient, thymectomy in the past 12 months, allergies or hypersensitivity to nipocalimab or its excipients, and myocardial infarction, unstable ischemic heart disease, or stroke in the past 12 weeks.

- **Interventions**:
	- Nipocalimab group (n = 77) received a 30 mg/kg loading dose followed by 15 mg/kg every 2 weeks for maintenance, along with the standard-of-care therapy for 24 weeks.
	- Placebo group (n = 76) received a matching placebo infusion every 2 weeks, plus standard-of-care therapy for 24 weeks.

- **Primary outcome**: There was a significant increase in least-squares mean reduction in the Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living score over weeks 22–24 in antibody-positive patients, with a reduction of 4.7 points for the nipocalimab group versus 3.25 points for placebo (mean difference 1.45; 95% CI 0.52 to 2.38).

### Myasthenia gravis in 2025: Five new things and four hopes for the future [^115oPC1i]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

While a number of exploratory biomarkers are under investigation, most remain distant from clinical use. For example, despite significant research activity and some emerging profiles, circulating miRNAs would still require multicenter laboratory standardization and studies to gain credence. The biomarkers most studied and proximal to clinical utility are the circulating immune cell repertoire and the humoral response itself. Indeed, B cell subsets are routinely measured in clinical practice in conjunction with Rituximab use, and IgG levels and immune cell characterization are incorporated in recent and in-progress trial designs. Genetic polymorphisms may predict response to some therapies. For example, fragment c gamma receptor 3A (FCGR3A) polymorphisms are established as impacting on-Rituximab relapses and a re-dosing requirement in Korean patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. Similarly, a missense mutation in C5 (c.2654G > A, conferring a p. Arg885His polymorphism) was found to abolish Eculizumab binding and underlie poor response to Eculizumab in Japanese and Chinese patients.

### Vitamin D: An evidence-based review [^111PrJBB]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays an important role in bone metabolism and seems to have some anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating properties. Recent epidemiologic studies have observed relationships between low vitamin D levels and multiple disease states. Low vitamin D levels are associated with increased overall and cardiovascular mortality, cancer incidence and mortality, and autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis.

Although it is well known that the combination of vitamin D and calcium is necessary to maintain bone density as people age, vitamin D may also be an independent risk factor for falls among the elderly. New recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics address the need for supplementation in breastfed newborns, raising many questions about the role of maternal supplementation during lactation. Unfortunately, little evidence guides clinicians on when to screen for vitamin D deficiency or effective treatment options.

### A phase 3 trial of inebilizumab in generalized myasthenia gravis [^1149FaBo]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The study MINT was published in 2025 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the disease myasthenia gravis. The trial question in the MINT study was: what is the role of inebilizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD19-positive B cells, in patients with AChR antibody-positive or MuSK antibody-positive generalized myasthenia gravis?

- **Study design**: Multi-center, double-blinded, RCT.
- **Population**: 236 patients (144 female, 92 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with AChR antibody-positive or MuSK antibody-positive generalized myasthenia gravis.
- **Key exclusion criteria**: Receipt of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, methotrexate in the past 4 weeks; use of corticosteroids, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil.
- **Interventions**:
	- n = 119 inebilizumab (intravenous dose of 300 mg administered on days 1 and 15 for all and additionally on day 183 for patients who were AChR antibody-positive for 52 weeks or 26 weeks for those who were MuSK antibody-positive)
	- n = 117 placebo (matching placebo for 52 weeks for participants who were AChR antibody-positive or 26 weeks for those who were MuSK antibody-positive).
- **Primary outcome**: Significant increase in least-squares mean reduction in Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living scale score at week 26, overall population (4.2 points vs. 2.2 points; MD 1.9, 95% CI 1 to 2.9).
- **Secondary outcomes**: Significant findings related to efficacy and safety measures.

### Frequency and clinical features of treatment-refractory myasthenia gravis [^112VQa1Y]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease of the neuromuscular junction with a prevalence of around 16 per 100,000. Patients are grouped according to the age at onset, presence of a specific antibody, thymus pathology, and distribution of symptoms. The majority of patients (approximately 80%) have antibodies against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR), while in a small subset of patients, antibodies against muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK), lipoprotein-related protein 4 (LRP4), or other postsynaptic structures of the neuromuscular junction are detected. In about 5% of patients, no antibodies are found. Additionally, paraneoplastic disease can occur in patients with thymoma, leading to generalized thymoma-associated myasthenia gravis with the detection of AChR antibodies in nearly all patients.

The natural, untreated course of myasthenia gravis has been associated with high mortality and persistence of symptoms in most patients. However, the introduction of immunosuppressive treatments, thymectomy in selected patients, modern intensive care medicine, as well as the availability of rescue treatments, such as intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), plasma exchange therapy (PLEX), or immunoadsorption (IA), has greatly improved outcomes across all subgroups of patients. Despite these advances, approximately 10–15% of patients still show a poor response to available standard treatments and consequently continue to suffer from disabling symptoms. They also experience frequent disease exacerbations, leading to reduced quality of life and frequent hospital admissions.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: Executive summary [^114XisZB]. Neurology (2016). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of myasthenia gravis, specifically in relation to IVIG, the MGFA 2016 guidelines recommend administering IVIG as a short-term treatment option for patients experiencing impending or manifest myasthenic crisis and those with significant respiratory or bulbar dysfunction. It is advised to initiate corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents simultaneously to achieve a sustained clinical response. Consider waiting several days for IVIG to exert a beneficial effect before commencing corticosteroids, as the latter may cause a transient worsening of myasthenic weakness.

### Safety, efficacy, and tolerability of efgartigimod in patients with generalised myasthenia gravis (ADAPT): a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^116Bf541]. The Lancet Neurology (2021). High credibility.

The study ADAPT was published by James F Howard Jr and colleagues in 2021 in the journal *The Lancet Neurology.* This study is related to myasthenia gravis. In the ADAPT study, the trial question was: what is the role of efgartigimod in patients with generalized myasthenia gravis? The study was a multi-center, double-blinded, RCT involving 167 patients (118 female, 49 male).

The inclusion criteria were adult patients with myasthenia gravis and a Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living score of ≥ 5. Key exclusion criteria included receipt of rituximab or eculizumab within 6 months, thymectomy within 3 months, IVIG or plasma exchange within 1 month, active hepatitis B, hepatitis C seropositivity, HIV seropositivity with a low CD4 count, serum IgG levels < 6 g/L, and pregnancy.

The interventions were as follows: 84 patients received efgartigimod (intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg, administered as four infusions per cycle, one infusion per week), and 83 patients received a placebo (intravenous administration of matching placebo). The primary outcome was a significant increase in positive anti-AChR antibody patients with a clinically meaningful reduction in the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living score at cycle 1 (68% vs. 30%; OR 4.95, 95% CI 2.21 to 11.53).

The secondary outcomes showed a significant increase in patients with a clinically meaningful reduction in the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis score (63% vs. 14%; OR 10.84, 95% CI 4.18 to 31.2).

### An update on treatments in myasthenia gravis [^112gPbss]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

This month, we discuss three papers which publish the results of trials into potential treatment approaches to myasthenia gravis (MG). When treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors alone fails to control symptoms, treatment with steroids may be required, often at high doses, which are associated with adverse side effects both in the short and long term. All the studies explore treatments that may replace or reduce the need for steroids in MG and use the quantitative myasthenia gravis (QMG) score and prednisone dose requirement as primary or secondary outcomes.

The first paper reports results of a randomized trial of routine thymectomy in non-thymomatous MG patients, the results of which may see this procedure incorporated into routine management of non-thymomatous MG. The second and third papers explore alternative steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agents. At present, the only medications shown to be effective in randomized placebo-controlled studies are azathioprine and cyclosporine, but both carry the risk of adverse reactions and have a requirement for close monitoring. The second study compares methotrexate and prednisone treatment to prednisone alone, and the final study assesses the effectiveness of leflunomide. All three studies represent a valuable addition to the literature on the treatment of a condition that currently has limited alternatives to long-term immunosuppression with steroids, azathioprine, or cyclosporine.

### Clinical features, pathogenesis, and treatment of myasthenia gravis: a supplement to the guidelines of the German Neurological Society [^113BnMrG]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is regarded as an autoimmune antibody-mediated disorder of neuromuscular synaptic transmission because (a) auto-antibody depositions are detectable at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ); (b) autoantibodies from MG patients cause MG symptoms when passively transferred into rodents; (c) active immunization of animals with auto-antigens reproduces the disease; and (d) antibody-depleting therapies decrease the severity of MG symptoms.

The incidence of MG ranges from 0.25 to 2.0 per 1,000,000. Due to effective treatment strategies and normal life expectancy, the prevalence of MG has risen in recent years to about 72:1,000,000 (range 15–179). About 10% of patients are children and adolescents. There is an increased familial risk for MG. Siblings or first-grade relatives of affected patients have a risk of 4.5% for developing MG, reflecting a profound genetic disposition for the disorder.

The clinical hallmark of MG consists of fluctuating fatigability and weakness affecting ocular, bulbar, and (proximal) limb skeletal muscle groups. A pragmatic clinical classification distinguishes pure ocular myasthenia from generalized myasthenia with mild, moderate, and severe manifestations. Ocular myasthenia exclusively affects the outer ocular muscles, including the M. levator palpebrae, and presents with ptosis and double vision. Ptosis and double vision may be transient, fluctuating, or progressive during the day. Only 10–20% of patients show muscle fatigability and weakness persistently restricted to the outer ocular muscles. The majority of patients proceed to develop generalized myasthenia.

### Correlation of quantitative myasthenia gravis and myasthenia gravis activities of daily living scales in the MGTX study [^1148JzJm]. Muscle & Nerve (2020). High credibility.

**Methods**: The MGTX was a multicenter, international, rater-blinded, randomized, 3-year clinical trial followed by a voluntary 2-year extension for patients with acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody–positive MG without thymoma. A total of 126 participants were enrolled and randomized: 66 were assigned to the thymectomy-plus-prednisone treatment (TPP) group, while 60 were assigned to the prednisone-alone (PA) group. All trial participants received high-dose, alternate-day prednisone on a predefined titration and tapering schedule based on the achievement of minimal manifestation status (MMS). Minimal manifestation status was defined as having "no symptoms or functional limitations from myasthenia gravis, but there may be some weakness on examination of some muscles". The protocol prescribed thymectomy to be performed within 30 days for those randomized to the TPP group. Study-blind raters assessed the participants at baseline and from month 3 onward up to 60 months. The detailed protocol of the MGTX trial and results have been published elsewhere.

### Vitamin D for the management of multiple sclerosis [^116jhCBY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system characterized by demyelination of the nerve sheaths, which can result in varying levels of disability. The occurrence and progression of the disease are considered by some to be associated with low serum levels of vitamin D. Studies investigating vitamin D supplementation in MS patients have illustrated a noticeable improvement in the course of the disease.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of vitamin D in the management of multiple sclerosis.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis Group Trials Register. This register comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and hand searches of relevant journals and abstract books of conferences.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing vitamin D with placebo or any other treatment for the management of multiple sclerosis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors selected trials for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted data independently. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Trialists were contacted for clarification of study details.

- **Main results**: We included a single trial involving 49 participants conducted over 52 weeks. This trial treated 25 patients with escalating doses of vitamin D compared with a control group of 24 patients. The trial provided some evidence of the potential benefit of the intervention on several outcomes, including the annualized relapse rate, EDSS scores, and suppression of T-cell proliferation. It also illustrated a measure of comparative safety in the relative evaluation.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^113Go8Pg]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Conversely, from the innate immune system, the adaptive immune system is downregulated by 1,25(OH)₂D in animal models. Thus, vitamin D deficiency might predispose individuals to autoimmune diseases. Observational studies have suggested this effect might also apply to humans.

The VITAL RCT showed that vitamin D supplementation decreased the risk of autoimmune diseases, particularly rheumatoid arthritis and polymyalgia rheumatica. At least eight large MR studies agree that genetically predicted lower 25(OH)D levels increased the risk of developing multiple sclerosis, either during adolescence or adulthood. In any case, the low number of intervention studies conducted so far does not allow for a clear understanding of the relationship between vitamin D and autoimmune diseases. However, these studies, at the time of writing, seem promising.

### High-dose vitamin D supplementation in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: a randomised clinical trial [^115gWvNw]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating and neurodegenerative autoimmune disease of the central nervous system with known environmental and genetic risk factors. Vitamin D is a known immunomodulator, and low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] is associated with a higher risk of developing MS and with increased clinical and radiological activity in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). However, most evidence suggesting a role for vitamin D in MS activity arises from observational studies with inherent possible limitations, including confounding and reverse causality. Two early pilot trials demonstrated potential promise but had limitations and were not designed as definitive trials, so it remained unclear after their completion if vitamin D supplementation impacts the course of established RRMS.

Three randomised clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation did not demonstrate an apparent benefit with respect to the primary outcome, but they were limited in duration or size and had some other limitations that reduce confidence in the results. These trials also tested the effect of vitamin D supplementation as an add-on to interferon beta as the MS disease-modifying therapy, where there is a possible interaction between vitamin D and interferon beta, underscoring the importance of evaluating the effect of vitamin D supplementation in the context of other MS therapies. We sought to test whether vitamin D supplementation as an add-on to a first-line disease-modifying therapy (DMT) reduces disease activity among people with active MS.

### Efficacy of perioperative high-dose prednisolone therapy during thymectomy in myasthenia gravis patients [^116UsxBC]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

After the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis (MG), informed consent was obtained from each patient and medical treatment was initiated. Depending on the patient's age, clinical history, MG status, and the presence of thymoma, the neurologists considered therapeutic options including the administration of anti-cholinesterase, high-dose prednisolone (PSL), thymectomy, intravenous immunoglobulin, and/or plasma exchange. Patients with less severe MG, such as MGFA I or IIA, were likely to undergo only thymectomy with or without anti-cholinesterase. In cases with advanced thymoma, thymectomy was considered a priority, and high-dose PSL was not administered. Patients with severe MG status, including MGFA IIB or more, were likely to have perioperative high-dose PSL (ph-PSL) therapy after obtaining the patients' consent.

The operative method was extended thymectomy in all cases, regardless of whether open chest surgery with sternotomy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) was performed. Extended thymectomy consisted of thymectomy with removal of all mediastinal fatty tissue between the two bilateral phrenic nerves from the top of the horns of the thymus to the diaphragm.

In order to manage the risk of worsening MG symptoms due to steroid effects, oral PSL was initiated at 10 to 20 mg and gradually escalated to 100 mg on alternate days. Once patients had achieved a stable disease status and had been maintained on high-dose PSL for two to four weeks, extended thymectomy was performed. When anti-cholinesterase was used as an initial treatment, it was reduced and discontinued after stabilization.

### Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and cholinergic modulation in myasthenia gravis and neuroinflammation [^112cBSPL]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2008). Low credibility.

The cholinergic network affects various cellular functions, including neurotransmission and immune reactions. In Myasthenia Gravis (MG), diagnosis and symptomatic therapy are based on cholinergic modulation by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI). In Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder associated with inflammatory pathology, cholinergic systems experience cell loss early. Treatments with special AChEI enhance cholinergic transmission and may also act as anti-inflammatory agents via immunocompetent cells expressing the alpha-7 acetylcholine receptor (AChR).

In Multiple Sclerosis (MS), an inflammatory T-cell-mediated disease, demyelination and neurodegeneration follow neuroinflammation. MS treatment includes anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory drugs. AChEI can induce cholinergic up-regulation, which has subsequent effects on neuroinflammation via alpha-7-AChR expressing cells. These effects are additional to the cognitive benefits induced by AChEI.

### Delving into immune modulation: Thymectomy in myasthenia gravis [^115hdE8N]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

This study still has several limitations: The sample size was relatively small, which may limit the statistical power and generalizability of the results. The follow-up period was 12 months, and longer-term studies are required to fully understand the lasting effects of thymectomy on immune function. Additionally, we did not measure regulatory T cells, which play a crucial role in immune tolerance and could provide further insights into the immune modulation effects of thymectomy.

### Vitamin D and autoimmunity: New aetiological and therapeutic considerations [^1133cdAu]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is frequently prescribed by rheumatologists to prevent and treat osteoporosis. Several observations have shown that vitamin D inhibits proinflammatory processes by suppressing the enhanced activity of immune cells that take part in the autoimmune reaction. Moreover, recent evidence strongly suggests that vitamin D supplementation may be therapeutically beneficial, particularly for Th1-mediated autoimmune disorders. Some reports imply that vitamin D may even be preventive in certain disorders such as multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes. It seems that vitamin D has crossed the boundaries of calcium metabolism and has become a significant factor in a number of physiological functions, specifically as a biological inhibitor of inflammatory hyperactivity.

### High dose vitamin D exacerbates central nervous system autoimmunity by raising T-cell excitatory calcium [^114npqfW]. Brain (2019). Low credibility.

Poor vitamin D status is associated with a higher relapse rate and earlier disability in multiple sclerosis. Based on these associations, patients with multiple sclerosis are frequently supplemented with the vitamin D precursor cholecalciferol, although it is unclear whether this regimen is of therapeutic benefit. To model the consequences of this common practice, mice were fed for more than three months with a low, medium, or high dose of cholecalciferol, representative of vitamin D deficiency, modest, and disproportionately high supplementation, respectively, in patients with multiple sclerosis. Compared to vitamin D-deprived mice, moderate supplementation reduced the severity of subsequent experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, which was associated with an expansion of regulatory T cells.

Direct exposure of murine or human T cells to vitamin D metabolites inhibited their activation. In contrast, mice with 25-(OH) vitamin D levels above 200 nmol/l developed fulminant experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis with massive CNS infiltration of activated myeloid cells, Th1, and Th17 cells. When dissecting this unexpected outcome, we observed that high, but not medium, dose vitamin D caused mild hypercalcemia, which rendered T cells more prone to pro-inflammatory activation. Exposing murine or human T cells to equivalent calcium concentrations in vitro enhanced its influx, triggering activation, upregulation of pro-inflammatory gene products, and enhanced transmigration across a blood-brain barrier model. These findings suggest that vitamin D at moderate levels may exert beneficial effects, but high levels can exacerbate central nervous system autoimmunity.

### Methylprednisolone sodium succinate [^111gAXMi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

An acute myopathy has been observed with the use of high doses of corticosteroids, most often occurring in patients with disorders of neuromuscular transmission (e.g. myasthenia gravis) or in patients receiving concomitant therapy with neuromuscular blocking drugs (e.g. pancuronium). This acute myopathy is generalized, may involve ocular and respiratory muscles, and may result in quadriparesis. Elevations of creatine kinase may occur. Clinical improvement or recovery after stopping corticosteroids may require weeks to years.

Psychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used, ranging from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression to frank psychotic manifestations. Existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may also be aggravated by corticosteroids.

- **Ophthalmic**: Intraocular pressure may become elevated in some individuals. If steroid therapy is continued for more than 6 weeks, intraocular pressure should be monitored.

- **Tumor lysis syndrome**: In post-marketing experience, tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) has been reported in patients with malignancies, including hematological malignancies and solid tumors, following the use of systemic corticosteroids alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Patients at high risk of TLS, such as those with tumors that have a high proliferative rate, high tumor burden, and high sensitivity to cytotoxic agents, should be monitored closely and appropriate precautions should be taken.

- **Information for patients**: Patients should be warned not to discontinue the use of corticosteroids abruptly, as this may lead to withdrawal symptoms or exacerbation of the underlying condition.

### Efficacy of perioperative high-dose prednisolone therapy during thymectomy in myasthenia gravis patients [^115KQZdd]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

This study aimed to investigate the benefits of administering perioperative high-dose prednisolone in conjunction with thymectomy in patients with myasthenia gravis.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed data from patients with Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America Clinical Class I to IIIB who had undergone an extended thymectomy between 1992 and 2009. Perioperative high-dose prednisolone was administered at starting doses of 10 to 20 mg and escalated up to 100 mg on alternate days. The treatment group comprised 70 patients receiving perioperative high-dose prednisolone, whereas the control group included 61 patients not treated with preoperative steroids. The two groups were compared with respect to baseline clinical characteristics, incidence of postoperative complications, and follow-up disease status.

- **Results**: Prednisolone-treated patients presented with more advanced disease compared to controls (Class IIB or greater, 42 [60.0%] versus 7 [11.3%], respectively; P < 0.001). Mean preoperative %FVC was lower and FEV1.0% was higher in treated patients than in controls (%FVC: 92.4 ± 2.3% versus 99.5 ± 2.4%, respectively; P = 0.037, FEV1.0%: 85.2 ± 1.3% versus 81.4 ± 0.9%, respectively; P = 0.017). The groups were similar in other variables including presence of thymoma and operative procedure. In the treatment group, disease status was significantly improved only by the induction of high-dose prednisolone before the surgery (P < 0.001), and these patients discontinued anti-cholinesterase therapy more frequently than controls (P < 0.001).

### Early fast-acting treatment strategy against generalized myasthenia gravis [^113mvXMY]. Muscle & Nerve (2017). Low credibility.

- **Kaplan–Meier curves**: Figure 2(A) presents the Kaplan–Meier curves for the first achievement of the treatment target (minimal manifestations (MM) or better with 5mg for ≥ 6 months) in both the early fast-acting treatment (EFT) and non-EFT groups.

- **Cumulative hazard curves**: Figure 2(B) shows the baseline cumulative hazard curves for both the EFT and non-EFT groups, excluding the effects of the covariables as a function of time.

- **Differences between low-dose and high-dose regimens in EFT patients**:

	- Differences in background and therapies utilized are highlighted. Table 3 shows comparisons of characteristics and therapies utilized for the EFT-treated patients when combined with either the low- or high-dose PSL regimens. Symptoms at the time when conditions were at their worst (worst QMG) were more severe (P < 0.0001), the duration of immune treatment was longer (P < 0.0001), and the frequency of thymectomy was higher (P < 0.01) in the EFT-treated patients given the high-dose PSL regimen. Severity (QMG), MG-QOL15-J score, and the percentage of patients who achieved MM-or-better-5mg for ≥ 6 months at the present time were not different between the two groups. Although the maximum dose of PSL during the disease course was much higher, and the duration of taking PSL at a dose of ≥ 20 mg was much longer in the high-dose PSL group (P < 0.0001), there was no difference between the two groups with regard to dose of oral PSL and frequency of CNI use. In the low-dose PSL group, only one patient received ≥ 20 mg.

### Corticosteroids for myasthenia gravis [^1124c8Zd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Although widely accepted as an appropriate immunosuppressive therapy, the efficacy of glucocorticosteroid treatment has only rarely been tested in controlled studies.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy of glucocorticosteroids or adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) medication in autoimmune myasthenia gravis.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register in July 2004, MEDLINE (from January 1966 to June 2004) and EMBASE (from January 1980 to June 2004). We also checked the bibliographies in reviews and the randomized trials and contacted their authors to identify additional published and unpublished data.

- **Selection criteria**: From the articles identified, we selected those open or controlled studies which allowed us to assess the outcome of treated and untreated patients at definite endpoints. Types of studies: quasi-randomised or randomized controlled trials.

- **Types of participants**: Patients with myasthenia gravis of all ages and all degrees of severity.

- **Types of interventions**: Any form of glucocorticosteroids or adrenocorticotrophic hormone treatment.

- **Types of outcome measures**:
	1. Primary outcome: Improvement after at least three months in either the weakest muscles or all muscles.
	2. Secondary outcomes:
		- Proportion of patients improved after at least six months.
		- Proportion of patients in remission.
		- Number of episodes of worsening during the first six months.
		- Acetylcholine receptor antibody titres after at least three months of therapy.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three authors extracted the data from the selected articles.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: Executive summary [^11756drW]. Neurology (2016). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for myasthenia gravis, particularly with respect to immunosuppressants, the MGFA 2016 guidelines recommend the selection of immunosuppressive agent dosage and the complete duration of treatment as follows:

- **Taper the corticosteroid dose**: Gradually reduce the dose once patients achieve treatment goals; recognize that continuing a low dose of corticosteroids long-term can help maintain the treatment goal in many patients.

- **Taper the nonsteroidal immunosuppressive agent dose**: Slowly reduce to the minimal effective amount once treatment goals have been achieved and maintained for 6 months to 2 years; make dosage adjustments no more frequently than every 3–6 months.

- **Recognize risks associated with tapering**: Understand that tapering of immunosuppressive drugs is associated with a risk of relapse, which may necessitate upward adjustments in dose. The risk of relapse is higher in symptomatic patients and after rapid taper.

- **Maintain immunosuppression**: It is usually necessary to maintain some level of immunosuppression for many years, sometimes for life.
