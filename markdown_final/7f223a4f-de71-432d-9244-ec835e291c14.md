## Question

What is the INR goal for antiphophlipin antibody syndrome?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate INR target for anticoagulation in antiphospholipid syndrome and how it varies by clinical scenario. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context, distinguishing venous from arterial thrombosis and whether this is a first event or recurrent thrombosis. Then, I should verify what high-quality randomized trials say about moderate versus high-intensity warfarin. Next, I will review contemporary guideline recommendations from EULAR, ACCP, and AHA/ASA. After that, I need to check special populations such as triple-positive patients and those with recurrent events despite therapeutic INR. Finally, I will consider monitoring challenges and synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with caveats about DOACs and bleeding risk.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because the INR target hinges on whether the index event was venous or arterial and whether this is a first event or a recurrence. For a first venous thromboembolism in definite APS, standard practice is indefinite anticoagulation with a VKA, and the intensity question centers on moderate versus high INR targets, so I should verify that before moving on [^112BkJRk] [^113Z2ACm].

> Now, I should review the randomized evidence comparing moderate-intensity warfarin (INR 2.0–3.0) with high-intensity warfarin (INR 3.0–4.0 or higher). The pivotal NEJM trial found no superiority of high-intensity warfarin and actually suggested numerically fewer recurrences with moderate intensity, with similar major bleeding, so I should not jump to conclusions favoring higher targets without data to support them [^112tRD7B]. Wait, let me verify consistency across trials; the WAPS trial similarly showed no advantage of high-intensity warfarin and more bleeding, reinforcing that higher INR targets are not beneficial in unselected APS cohorts [^11343Dkw]. A systematic review and meta-analysis likewise concluded no added benefit of high-intensity VKA over moderate intensity, which aligns with the RCT signal [^112tDEok].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my interpretation matches contemporary standards. EULAR 2019 recommends VKA with a target INR of 2.0–3.0 for first venous thrombosis in definite APS, and for first arterial thrombosis it suggests VKA INR 2.0–3.0 plus low-dose aspirin, reserving higher-intensity INR 3.0–4.0 only as a consideration after recurrences and with careful bleeding risk assessment, which I should keep in mind for refractory cases [^112BkJRk] [^114RfUka] [^113TKmpJ]. ACCP 2012 suggests moderate-intensity INR 2.0–3.0 rather than higher intensity for APS with prior arterial or venous thromboembolism, again reflecting the lack of benefit from higher targets in trials [^111f7UzT]. AHA/ASA stroke guidance recommends targeting INR 2.0–3.0 rather than greater than 3.0 in APS-related ischemic stroke or TIA to balance thrombosis and bleeding risks, which is consistent with the above [^113djaSV] [^112AmGtW].

> Hold on, I should verify the special case of recurrent thrombosis despite therapeutic INR. For refractory or recurrent thrombosis, EULAR allows escalation to INR 3.0–4.0, addition of low-dose aspirin, or switching to LMWH, but this is individualized and evidence is limited, so I need to ensure bleeding risk is reassessed before intensifying intensity or layering therapy [^113TKmpJ] [^114idxSK]. Let me reconsider whether higher INR truly helps; observational signals have suggested possible benefit in small series, but randomized data have not confirmed superiority, so escalation should be reserved for carefully selected patients after excluding nonadherence, INR variability, and alternative drivers of recurrence [^112tDEok] [^113Z2ACm].

> I will now examine monitoring and laboratory considerations because INR reliability can be compromised in APS. Lupus anticoagulant can variably affect thromboplastin reagents and lead to spurious INR results, so I should double-check for discordance between POC and plasma INR and consider chromogenic factor X or alternative monitoring in select LA-positive patients with unstable INR patterns or suspected assay interference [^112QBb5g] [^116C1Kz2] [^113B5sHe]. But wait, what if the INR seems supratherapeutic yet the patient has breakthrough thrombosis; that mismatch should prompt me to verify true anticoagulation intensity with alternative assays rather than reflexively lowering the dose [^111MD1EQ].

> Next, I should review DOACs because patients often ask about alternatives to warfarin. I need to ensure I do not overgeneralize; rivaroxaban failed to show noninferiority and had more arterial events in high-risk APS populations, and apixaban signals have also raised concern for increased stroke risk in APS, so DOACs should be avoided in APS with arterial thrombosis or triple positivity, with VKA INR 2.0–3.0 remaining preferred for secondary prevention [^112fjVHV] [^114Pf2Y1] [^113aGwKJ]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought DOACs might be broadly acceptable after venous-only events, but regulatory and guideline positions have become more conservative, so I should caution against routine DOAC use outside of select scenarios and trials, and favor VKA as first-line [^111QTEhP] [^1155q8PF].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified answer. For a first venous thrombosis in definite APS, target INR 2.0–3.0 with indefinite VKA is standard and supported by trials and guidelines. For a first arterial thrombosis, target INR 2.0–3.0 plus low-dose aspirin is reasonable per EULAR, with INR 3.0–4.0 reserved for recurrences after careful bleeding risk assessment. For recurrent thrombosis despite therapeutic INR, consider intensification to INR 3.0–4.0, add low-dose aspirin, or switch to LMWH, recognizing the evidence base is limited and decisions should be individualized [^112BkJRk] [^114RfUka] [^113TKmpJ] [^111f7UzT]. I should confirm that these ranges align with stroke guidance as well, which similarly favors INR 2.0–3.0 over higher targets in APS-related cerebrovascular disease [^113djaSV] [^112AmGtW].

> Finally, I need to ensure I address duration and quality of anticoagulation. Indefinite anticoagulation is generally recommended after a first thrombotic APS event given high recurrence risk after cessation, and maintaining time in therapeutic range of at least 70% is associated with fewer events, so I should emphasize INR stability, drug interactions, and adherence to minimize both thrombosis and bleeding [^113Z2ACm] [^113i5Qfj]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not overstating any single study; the core message remains that moderate-intensity VKA with INR 2.0–3.0 is the evidence-based default, with higher-intensity strategies reserved for select refractory cases after multidisciplinary review of risks and alternatives [^112tRD7B] [^112BkJRk] [^111f7UzT].

---

The INR goal for antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is **2.0–3.0** for most patients with venous or arterial thrombosis [^112BkJRk] [^114RfUka], as moderate-intensity warfarin is effective and safer than high-intensity regimens [^112tRD7B] [^11343Dkw]. For recurrent thrombosis despite adequate INR 2.0–3.0, consider **INR 3.0–4.0** or add low-dose aspirin, balancing bleeding risk [^113TKmpJ] [^112uqJES]. DOACs are not recommended for arterial thrombosis or triple-positive APS due to higher recurrence risk; use warfarin with INR 2.0–3.0 as standard [^112fjVHV] [^111QTEhP] [^113aGwKJ].

---

## Standard INR target range

The **standard INR target range** for APS patients with venous or arterial thrombosis is **2.0–3.0** [^112BkJRk] [^114RfUka]. Moderate-intensity warfarin (INR 2.0–3.0) is effective for secondary prevention and is associated with lower bleeding risk than high-intensity regimens [^112tRD7B] [^112tDEok].

---

## Evidence supporting INR 2.0–3.0

- **Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)**: Two RCTs showed no additional benefit of high-intensity warfarin (INR 3.0–4.5) over moderate-intensity (INR 2.0–3.0) in preventing recurrent thrombosis, but high-intensity increased bleeding [^112tRD7B] [^11343Dkw].

- **Systematic reviews**: Meta-analyses confirm no superiority of high-intensity warfarin and show higher bleeding risk, supporting INR 2.0–3.0 as standard [^112tDEok] [^1151Dy8F].

- **Guideline recommendations**: EULAR and BSH recommend INR 2.0–3.0 for most APS patients with thrombosis [^112BkJRk] [^1144vuqE].

---

## Situations requiring higher INR targets

In select situations, a higher INR target (**3.0–4.0**) may be considered:

- **Recurrent thrombosis**: Despite adequate INR 2.0–3.0, consider INR 3.0–4.0 or add low-dose aspirin, balancing bleeding risk [^113TKmpJ] [^112uqJES].

- **Triple-positive profile**: Patients with lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibodies have higher recurrence risk; some experts consider higher intensity in this subgroup [^111hgo2j] [^1117udCQ].

- **Arterial thrombosis**: Although INR 2.0–3.0 is standard, some guidelines allow considering INR 3.0–4.0 for recurrent arterial events, with caution [^113TKmpJ].

---

## Risks associated with higher INR targets

Higher INR targets (**3.0–4.0**) increase bleeding risk, including major hemorrhage, without proven additional benefit in most APS patients [^112tRD7B] [^112tDEok]. Accordingly, careful risk–benefit assessment is required before intensifying therapy [^112uqJES].

---

## Role of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)

DOACs (rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran) are **not recommended** for APS with arterial thrombosis or triple-positive profiles due to higher recurrence risk versus warfarin [^112fjVHV] [^111QTEhP] [^113aGwKJ]. They may be considered only in select venous-only, non-triple-positive patients when warfarin is unsuitable, with close monitoring [^111xKE6S] [^116FP3dg].

---

## Clinical scenarios and recommended INR targets

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended inr target** | **Evidence/guideline** |
|-|-|-|
| First venous thrombosis | 2.0–3.0 | EULAR, BSH, RCTs [^112BkJRk] [^1144vuqE] [^112tRD7B] |
| First arterial thrombosis | 2.0–3.0 (+ aspirin) | EULAR, AHA/ASA [^114RfUka] [^113djaSV] |
| Recurrent thrombosis despite INR 2.0–3.0 | 3.0–4.0 or add aspirin | EULAR, BSH [^113TKmpJ] [^112uqJES] |
| Triple-positive profile | 2.0–3.0 (consider 3.0–4.0 if recurrent) | Expert opinion, EULAR [^112uqJES] [^113TKmpJ] |
| DOAC use | Not recommended for arterial or triple-positive | RCTs, guidelines [^112fjVHV] [^111QTEhP] [^113aGwKJ] |

---

## Monitoring and management of INR fluctuations

INR monitoring is essential; **time in therapeutic range (TTR) ≥ 70%** is associated with fewer thrombotic events [^113i5Qfj]. Lupus anticoagulant can affect INR accuracy; consider chromogenic factor X assays or alternative monitoring when INR is unreliable [^112QBb5g] [^116C1Kz2].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Standard INR target**: 2.0–3.0 for most APS patients with thrombosis [^112BkJRk] [^114RfUka].

- **Higher INR target**: Consider 3.0–4.0 only for recurrent thrombosis despite adequate INR 2.0–3.0, balancing bleeding risk [^113TKmpJ] [^112uqJES].

- **DOACs**: Not recommended for arterial thrombosis or triple-positive APS; warfarin remains first-line [^112fjVHV] [^111QTEhP] [^113aGwKJ].

- **Monitoring**: Aim for TTR ≥ 70% and use alternative assays if INR is unreliable [^113i5Qfj] [^116C1Kz2].

---

The INR goal for APS is **2.0–3.0** for most patients, with higher targets reserved for select refractory cases and DOACs avoided in high-risk profiles.

Therapeutic range for high-risk groups: The most common therapeutic range for treatment with VKAs is INR 2.0 to 3.0, and case series in deficiencies of protein C, protein S, antithrombin, or with factor V Leiden or prothrombin gene polymorphisms have not provided any indication that moderate intensity (INR 2.0–3.0) is inadequate, whereas in retrospective studies of antiphospholipid antibodies moderate-intensity anticoagulation often was insufficient to prevent arterial or venous thrombosis; a systematic review based on 16 studies (two RCTs, two subgroup analyses from RCTs, three prospective cohorts or subgroup analysis, and nine retrospective cohorts or subgroup analyses) found more fatal thromboembolic events than fatal hemorrhages (18 vs one) and noted the risk of thromboembolic events was inversely related to the INR in observational studies but not in RCTs, with current criteria stating at least two positive tests should be recorded with an interval of at least 12 weeks.

### Bleeding and recurrent thrombosis in definite antiphospholipid syndrome… [^115dTrqN]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

As a result, definite conclusions are difficult to draw, and even recent guidelines for the treatment of patients with APS and previous thrombosis do not agree, recommending target INRs of 3. 57 or 2.
5. 8. This study was an attempt to clarify the risks and benefits of oral anticoagulation to a target INR of
3. 5 in patients with definite APS and previous thrombosis. Since 1995, we have adopted oral anticoagulation to a target INR of 3. 5 as the standard therapy for patients with aPLs and previous thromboses. In this study, we found that this practice does not result in a high incidence of intracranial or fatal bleeding in patients with definite APS who are at a high risk of recurrent thrombosis. In the United Kingdom, the majority of patients attending anticoagulant clinics are receiving warfarin because they have atrial fibrillation and are aiming for a target INR of 2. 0 to 3.

0. When a target INR of 2. 5 is used, subtherapeutic INRs below
2. 0 are found much more frequently, 12, 20 a fact that may have devastating implications in patients at high risk for thrombotic recurrences. The increased risk of using a high target INR may have been compensated for by the fact that patients with APS are generally young, since advanced age is a consistent risk factor for cerebral bleeding in patients receiving anticoagulation. 21, 23–26 Moreover, the differences seen in the frequency of intracerebral bleeding between our series and that of Gorter26 may also suggest that the nature of the presumed small vessel damage may not be the same in patients with cerebral thrombosis caused by APS and that caused by long-standing arterial hypertension and/or diabetes.

When the indication for and intensity of anticoagulant therapy are determined in an individual patient, bleeding risk is clearly not the only factor to consider. It must be weighed against the possibility of recurrent serious thrombosis. 23, 29 On the basis of a cautious analysis of our results and those of previous studies, 1, 2 we believe that most patients with definite APS and previous thrombosis should be treated to a target INR of 3. 5.

Antiphospholipid Syndrome

APS is defined by the occurrence of venous and/or arterial thrombosis and/or pregnancy morbidity, in the setting of persistent circulating antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs). 88 There are 3 types of aPLs used in the Sydney criteria to diagnose APS: anti‐beta2‐glycoprotein I, anticardiolipin, and antibodies detected by lupus‐anticoagulant assays (anti‐beta2‐glycoprotein I or antiprothrombin). 88 Additional antibodies directed against phospholipid/phospholipid‐protein have been causally linked to APS (IgA and IgM anticardiolipin, IgA and IgM beta‐2 glycoprotein I, anti‐phosphatidylserine antibodies, anti‐phosphatidylethanolamine antibodies, anti‐prothrombin antibodies, and antibodies against the phosphatidylserine‐prothrombin complex). Presence of aPLs in the serum does not necessarily translate to APS, but it is associated with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic seropositivity to thrombotic microangiopathy with multiorgan involvement and failure. 88 The exact mechanisms of APS remain largely unknown but a "2‐hit" model has been proposed where the first hit is the presence of aPLs and the second hit is frequently related to activation of the innate immune system. 89

The 14th International Congress on Antiphospholipid Antibodies Task Force Report on Antiphospholipid Syndrome Treatment Trends recommends that VKAs should be the first‐line anticoagulation in patients with thrombotic APS. 90 Although there is some controversy on the therapeutic goals of anticoagulation in patients with APS, evidence suggests that the target INR should be between 2.0 and 3.0, since patients treated to a higher INR goal (3.0–4.0) have the same rate of thrombotic recurrence but higher incidence of bleeding. 91, 92 Management of anticoagulation with VKAs in patients with APS is particularly challenging. In addition to the issues inherent to VKA use, monitoring of anticoagulation may be complicated by the variable responsiveness of thromboplastin reagents to aPLs, which may potentially influence the validity of INR measurement. 93

### Rivaroxaban versus warfarin to treat patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome, with or without systemic lupus erythematosus (RAPS): a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 2 / 3, non-inferiority trial [^116Y4Ees]. The Lancet: Haematology (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Rivaroxaban is established for the treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism, but whether it is useful in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome is uncertain.

Methods

This randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 2/3, non-inferiority trial, done in two UK hospitals, included patients with antiphospholipid syndrome who were taking warfarin for previous venous thromboembolism, with a target international normalised ratio of 2·5. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to continue with warfarin or receive 20 mg oral rivaroxaban daily. Randomisation was done centrally, stratified by centre and patient type (with vs without systemic lupus erythematosus). The primary outcome was percentage change in endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) from randomisation to day 42, with non-inferiority set at less than 20% difference from warfarin in mean percentage change. Analysis was by modified intention to treat. Other thrombin generation parameters, thrombosis, and bleeding were also assessed. Treatment effect was measured as the ratio of rivaroxaban to warfarin for thrombin generation. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN68222801.

Findings

Of 116 patients randomised between June 5, 2013, and Nov 11, 2014, 54 who received rivaroxaban and 56 who received warfarin were assessed. At day 42, ETP was higher in the rivaroxaban than in the warfarin group (geometric mean 1086 nmol/L per min, 95% CI 957–1233 vs 548, 484–621, treatment effect 2·0, 95% CI 1·7–2·4, p < 0·0001). Peak thrombin generation was lower in the rivaroxaban group (56 nmol/L, 95% CI 47–66 vs 86 nmol/L, 72–102, treatment effect 0·6, 95% CI 0·5–0·8, p = 0·0006). No thrombosis or major bleeding were seen. Serious adverse events occurred in four patients in each group.

Interpretation

ETP for rivaroxaban did not reach the non-inferiority threshold, but as there was no increase in thrombotic risk compared with standard-intensity warfarin, this drug could be an effective and safe alternative in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and previous venous thromboembolism.

Therapeutic INR targets for VKA therapy are defined as follows: For patients treated with VKAs, we recommend a therapeutic INR range of 2.0 to 3.0 (target INR of 2.5) rather than a lower (INR < 2) or higher (INR 3.0–5.0) range (Grade 1B). For patients with antiphospholipid syndrome with previous arterial or venous thromboembolism, we suggest VKA therapy targeted to a moderate-intensity INR range (INR 2.0–3.0) rather than higher intensity (INR 3.0–4.5) (Grade 2B).

### Therapy with direct oral anticoagulants for secondary prevention of thromboembolic events in the antiphospholipid syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^1118aRSZ]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Background

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a systemic autoimmune disorder characterised by venous thrombosis (VT) or arterial thrombosis (AT) and/or pregnancy morbidity in the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) on two or more occasions at least 12 weeks apart. The aPL include lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibody or anti-β2 glycoprotein I IgG or IgM antibodies. APS occurs as a primary condition, or secondary in the presence of, for example, SLE. Evidence suggests that the aPL profile is prognostic, and triple positivity increases the risk of thromboembolic events.

The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology recommends for secondary prophylaxis of thrombosis APS 'treatment with VKAs (vitamin K antagonists) with INR (internationalised normalised ratio) 2–3 or INR 3–4' considering the individual's risk of bleeding and recurrent thrombosis. Treatment with VKA with INR 2–3 plus low-dose aspirin may also be considered.

The pharmacodynamics of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are inhibition of either factor IIa (thrombin; for example, dabigatran etexilate) or factor Xa (eg, rivaroxaban, edoxaban or apixaban). DOACs are easy to use with simple dosing, anticoagulation monitoring is not indicated and drug plasma levels should not be followed. However, dosage should be adjusted in patients with impaired renal or liver function.

### Longterm anticoagulation is preferable for patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. result of a decision analysis [^114f9azv]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) have a high risk for rethrombosis. Anticoagulation with warfarin and aspirin reduces the frequency of recurrences. No universally accepted approach regarding the duration and intensity of antithrombotic therapy exists. We investigated the best antithrombotic regimen for patients with APS after the first deep venous thrombosis (DVT).

Methods

We identified 6 anticoagulation regimens used in such patients, the rates of morbidity and mortality associated with bleeding, and the rates of recurrent thrombosis associated with APS by literature search. A decision tree was developed and the expected risks and benefits of each anticoagulation regimen were assessed at 2 different time points: at one year and again 4 years after the initial thrombosis.

Results

Based on the decision analysis, longterm warfarin alone at an international normalization ratio (INR) between 3.0 and 4.0 had the highest expected utility of the 6 antithrombotic regimens, both one year and 4 years after the initial venous thrombotic event. Short term anticoagulation for only 6 months is less beneficial. Combination therapy of warfarin and aspirin (ASA) does not offer an improvement in the expected utility over warfarin alone.

Conclusion

Although the applicability of this analysis to clinical decision-making is not entirely clear, patients with APS presenting with DVT appear to benefit from longterm warfarin (INR 3.0–4.0) that may be superior to warfarin (INR 2.0–3.0). Short term warfarin therapy seems to be less beneficial and the use of ASA does not offer a clear additional benefit. Randomized controlled trials are needed to provide a better basis for recommendations for the treatment APS.

### Apixaban compared with warfarin to prevent thrombosis in thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome: a randomized trial [^111vpdJA]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

We report the full methods and study design elsewhere. Briefly, this is a US multicenter PROBE study in TAPS patients. At the beginning of the study, patients were randomized to either apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily or warfarin (target international normalized ratio [INR] 2–3) for 12 months. In 2016, to enhance recruitment, collaboration with the University of Utah Trial Innovation Center facilitated the identification of multiple external collaborators and activation of 1 site (The Ohio State University), which enrolled 1 patient prior to study closure. All other patients were enrolled at Intermountain Medical Center. The study was registered (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02295475), approved by the Intermountain Healthcare Institutional Review Board (IRB), and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice principles. An internal data safety monitoring board (DSMB) with expertise in cardiovascular and thrombotic disease and research was empaneled. The DSMB convened at predetermined intervals and provided recommendations regarding the management of the study to the investigators with reports filed to the IRB.

Regarding medical management for antiphospholipid syndrome, more specifically with respect to management of arterial thrombosis, BSH 2012 guidelines recommend to initiate antithrombotic therapy consisting of either antiplatelet therapy or warfarin in patients with APS and ischemic stroke with a single positive antiphospholipid antibody test result.
Consider preferring antiplatelet therapy on grounds of convenience.

### Variability in the international normalised ratio (INR) in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and positive lupus anticoagulant: should the INR targets be higher? [^114gj4hL]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

We present the case of a 34-year-old woman with a history of antiphospholipid syndrome with triple positivity for antiphospholipid antibodies, who had multiple thrombotic events, predominantly pulmonary embolic events, despite treatment with enoxaparin. She is currently on warfarin, with which she has been adequately controlled most of the time, presenting with only one haemorrhagic event consisting of haematuria and prolonged international normalised ratio (INR) without bleeding. This kind of patient represents a challenge for clinicians, particularly due to INR therapeutic targets, which should be higher than recommended in other patients due to the lupus anticoagulant positivity.

### Monitoring of anticoagulation in thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome [^111MD1EQ]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation is central to the management of thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The standard anticoagulant treatment for thrombotic APS is life-long warfarin or an alternative vitamin K antagonist. The role of direct oral anticoagulants for thrombotic APS is not established due to the lack of definitive evidence and has recently been addressed in international guidance. Other anticoagulant options include low molecular weight heparin, unfractionated heparin, and fondaparinux. In APS patients, lupus anticoagulant can affect phospholipid-dependent coagulation monitoring tests, so that they may not reflect true anticoagulation intensity. Accurate assessment of anticoagulation intensity is essential, to optimize anticoagulant dosing and facilitate thrombus resolution; minimize the risk of recurrent thrombosis or bleeding; inform assessment of whether recurrent thrombosis is related to breakthrough thrombosis while on therapeutic anticoagulation, subtherapeutic anticoagulation, non-adherence, or spurious results; and guide the management of bleeding. Knowledge of anticoagulant intensity also informs assessment and comparison of anticoagulation regimens in clinical studies. Considerations regarding anticoagulation dosing and/or monitoring of thrombotic APS patients underpin appropriate management in special situations, notably APS-related severe renal impairment, which can occur in APS or APS/systemic lupus erythematosus-related nephropathy or catastrophic APS; and APS-related thrombocytopenia. Anticoagulant dosing and monitoring in thrombotic APS patients also require consideration in anticoagulant-refractory APS and during pregnancy. In this review, we summarize the tests generally used in monitoring anticoagulant therapy, use of the main anticoagulants considered for thrombotic APS, lupus anticoagulant effects on anticoagulation monitoring tests, and strategies for appropriate anticoagulant monitoring in thrombotic APS.

### Increased warfarin consumption and residual fibrin turnover in thrombotic patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome [^1169dKaj]. Thrombosis Research (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Anedoctal reports suggest that some thrombotic primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (PAPS) patients on oral anticoagulation require higher than average doses to achieve given targets international normalized ratios (INR).

Materials and Methods

To test the hypothesis of relative warfarin resistance in thrombotic PAPS and the effect of baseline IgG anticardiolipin antibodies, the cytochrome CYP2C9 and the vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1) haplotypes we compared weekly warfarin consumption of 40 TPAPS (mean age 44 ± 16years) with that of 65 thrombotic patients with inherited thrombophilia (IT) (mean age 52 ± 18) at similar target INR 2.0–3.0 followed up between January-1994 and January 2003. To investigate an involvement of the epoxidation pathway in this difference and to assess enhanced residual fibrin turnover decarboxylated prothrombin (PIVKA-II) and D-dimers (DD) were cross-sectionally investigated in the same patients between March and May 2008.

Results

CEX7 and VKORC1 polymorphisms explained 45.1% of the variability in warfarin consumption, whose age-adjusted mean weekly consumption was greater in PAPS than IT (27.62 vs 21.24 mg, p = 0.03). In PAPS baseline IgG aCL and VKORC1 predicted weekly warfarin consumption (p = 0.028 and p = 0.024). IgG β(2)GPI and warfarin dose independently predicted plasma PIVKA-II (p = 0.01 and p = 0.02). Age and sex adjusted DD was greater in PAPS than IT (132 ± 34 vs 83 ± 37 mg/dl, p = 0.03).

Conclusions

Thrombotic PAPS exhibit a degree of warfarin resistance partly accounted by antiphospholipid antibodies and are in a state of enhanced fibrin turnover despite oral anticoagulation that might have implications for re-thrombosis and atherosclerosis.

### Venous thrombosis in the antiphospholipid syndrome [^115gYpU5]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2009). Low credibility.

The antiphospholipid syndrome is a relatively common acquired cause of venous thrombosis. Up to 20% of cases of deep vein thrombosis, with and without pulmonary embolism, may be associated with antiphospholipid antibodies. These antibodies are typically detected in lupus anticoagulant assays and tests for anticardiolipin antibodies. Most antiphospholipid antibodies are directed against several phospholipid-binding plasma proteins. The most common antigens are beta2-glycoprotein I and prothrombin. Immunoassays using these purified antigens are now available. In addition to being markers for thrombotic risk, antiphospholipid antibodies have been shown to directly contribute to hypercoagulability in animal models and in various in vitro studies. Prevention of recurrent venous thrombosis in patients with the antiphospholipid syndrome requires long-term anticoagulation. The optimal intensity of warfarin therapy is an ongoing issue, but most clinicians currently favor a target INR in the 2.0 to 3.0 range. In certain patients, antiphospholipid antibodies may interfere with determination of the INR, requiring other approaches to monitor and adjust the warfarin dose. Low-dose aspirin is typically recommended for primary prevention of thrombosis in asymptomatic patients with moderate to high levels of antiphospholipid antibodies, although strong supporting data are lacking.

Regarding specific circumstances for transient ischemic attack, more specifically with respect to patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend to consider targeting an INR of 2–3 rather than > 3 to effectively balance the risk of excessive bleeding against the risk of thrombosis in patients with a TIA with confirmed antiphospholipid syndrome treated with warfarin.

### Antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents for secondary prevention of stroke and other thromboembolic events in people with antiphospholipid syndrome [^112tDEok]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by arterial or venous thrombosis (or both), and/or pregnancy morbidity in association with the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. The prevalence of APS is estimated at 40 to 50 cases per 100,000 people. The most common sites of thrombosis are cerebral arteries and deep veins of the lower limbs. People with a definite APS diagnosis have an increased lifetime risk of recurrent thrombotic events.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antiplatelet (AP) or anticoagulant agents, or both, for the secondary prevention of recurrent thrombosis, particularly ischemic stroke, in people with APS.

Search Methods

We last searched the MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, and ongoing trials registers on 22 November 2019. We checked reference lists of included studies, systematic reviews, and practice guidelines. We also contacted experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated any anticoagulant or AP agent, or both, in the secondary prevention of thrombosis in people with APS, according to the criteria valid when the study took place. We did not include studies specifically addressing women with obstetrical APS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pairs of review authors independently worked on each step of the review, following Cochrane methods. We summarized the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We identified eight studies including 811 participants that compared different AP or anticoagulant agents. NOAC (non-VKA oral anticoagulant: rivaroxaban 15 or 20 mg/d) versus standard-dose VKA (vitamin K antagonist: warfarin at moderate International Normalized Ratio [INR] - 2.5) or adjusted [INR 2.0–3.0] dose): In three studies there were no differences in any thromboembolic event (including death) and major bleeding (moderate-certainty evidence), but an increased risk of stroke (risk ratio [RR] 14.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.87 to 106.8; moderate-certainty evidence). One of the studies reported a small benefit of rivaroxaban in terms of quality of life at 180 days measured as health state on Visual Analogue Scale (mean difference [MD] 7 mm, 95% CI 2.01 to 11.99; low-certainty evidence), but not measured as health utility on a scale from 0 to 1 (MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.10; low-certainty evidence). High-dose VKA (warfarin with a target INR of 3.1 to 4.0 [mean 3.3] or 3.5 [mean 3.2]) versus standard-dose VKA (warfarin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 [mean 2.3] or 2.5 [mean 2.5]): In two studies there were no differences in the rates of thrombotic events and major bleeding (RR 2.22, 95% CI 0.79 to 6.23, low-certainty evidence), but an increased risk of minor bleeding in one study during a mean of 3.4 years (standard deviation [SD] 1.2) of follow-up (RR 2.55, 95% CI 1.07 to 6.07). In both trials there was evidence of a higher risk of any bleeding (hazard ratio [HR] 2.03 95% CI 1.12 to 3.68; low-certainty evidence) in the high-dose VKA group, and for this outcome (any bleeding) the incidence is not different, only the time to event is showing an effect. Standard-dose VKA plus a single AP agent (warfarin at a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 plus aspirin 100 mg/d) versus standard-dose VKA (warfarin at a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0): One high-risk-of-bias study showed an increased risk of any thromboembolic event with combined treatment (RR 2.14, 95% CI 1.04 to 4.43; low-certainty evidence) and reported on major bleeding with five cases in the combined treatment group and one case in the standard-dose VKA treatment group, resulting in RR 7.42 (95% CI 0.91 to 60.7; low-certainty evidence) and no differences for secondary outcomes (very low- to low-certainty evidence). Single/dual AP agent and standard-dose VKA (pooled results): Two high-risk-of-bias studies compared a combination of AP and VKA (aspirin 100 mg/d plus warfarin or unspecified VKA at a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 or 2.0 to 2.5) with a single AP agent (aspirin 100 mg/d), but did not provide any conclusive evidence regarding the effects of those drugs in people with APS (very low-certainty evidence). One of the above-mentioned studies was a three-armed study that compared a combination of AP and VKA (aspirin 100 mg/d plus warfarin at a target INR of 2.0 to 2.5) with dual AP therapy (aspirin 100 mg/d plus cilostazol 200 mg/d) and dual AP therapy (aspirin 100 mg/d plus cilostazol 200 mg/d) versus a single AP treatment (aspirin 100 mg/d). This study reported on stroke (very low-certainty evidence) but did not report on any thromboembolic events, major bleeding, or any secondary outcomes. We identified two ongoing studies and three studies are awaiting classification.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence identified indicates that NOACs compared with standard-dose VKAs may increase the risk of stroke and do not appear to alter the risk of other outcomes (moderate-certainty evidence). Using high-dose VKA versus standard-dose VKA did not alter the risk of any thromboembolic event or major bleeding but may increase the risk of any form of bleeding (low-certainty evidence). Standard-dose VKA combined with an AP agent compared with standard-dose VKA alone may increase the risk of any thromboembolic event and does not appear to alter the risk of major bleeding or other outcomes (low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the benefit or harm of using standard-dose VKA plus AP agents versus single or dual AP therapy, or dual versus single AP therapy, for the secondary prevention of recurrent thrombosis in people with APS (very low-certainty evidence).

### Rivaroxaban limits complement activation compared with warfarin in antiphospholipid syndrome patients with venous thromboembolism [^116w5ZYY]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

Essentials Complement activation has a pathogenic role in thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Coagulation proteases such as factor Xa can activate complement proteins. Complement activation markers were elevated in anticoagulated thrombotic APS patients. Complement activation decreased in APS patients switching from warfarin to rivaroxaban.

Summary

Background Complement activation may play a major role in the pathogenesis of thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Coagulation proteases such as factor Xa can activate complement proteins. Aims To establish whether rivaroxaban, a direct factor Xa inhibitor, limits complement activation compared with warfarin in APS patients with previous venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods A total of 111 APS patients with previous VTE, on warfarin target INR 2.5, had blood samples taken at baseline and at day 42 after randomization in the RAPS (Rivaroxaban in Antiphospholipid Syndrome) trial. Fifty-six patients remained on warfarin and 55 switched to rivaroxaban. Fifty-five normal controls (NC) were also studied. Markers of complement activation (C3a, C5a, terminal complement complex [SC5b-9] and Bb fragment) were assessed. Results APS patients had significantly higher complement activation markers compared with NC at both time-points irrespective of the anticoagulant. There were no differences between the two patient groups at baseline, or patients remaining on warfarin at day 42. In 55 patients randomized to rivaroxaban, C3a, C5a and SC5b-9 were lower at day 42 (median (ng mL⁻¹) [confidence interval] 64 [29–125] vs. 83 [35–147], 9 [2–15] vs. 12 [4–18] and 171 [56–245] vs. 201 [66–350], respectively) but levels of Bb fragment were unchanged. There were no correlations between rivaroxaban levels and complement activation markers. Conclusions APS patients with previous VTE on warfarin exhibit increased complement activation, which is likely to occur via the classical pathway and is decreased by rivaroxaban administration. Rivaroxaban may therefore potentially provide an additional benefit to its anticoagulant effect in this patient group by limiting complement activation.

### Warfarin and heparin monitoring in antiphospholipid syndrome [^112QBb5g]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2024). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation is central to the management of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), an acquired thrombo-inflammatory disorder characterized by thrombosis (venous, arterial, or microvascular) or pregnancy morbidity, in association with persistent antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL; ie, 1 or more of lupus anticoagulant [LA], anticardiolipin, anti-beta-2- glycoprotein I, IgG, or IgM antibodies). The mainstay of anticoagulation in patients with thrombotic APS is warfarin or an alternative vitamin K antagonist (VKA) and, in certain situations, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH). Accurate assessment of anticoagulation intensity underpins optimal anticoagulant dosing for thrombus treatment or primary/secondary prevention. In patients with APS on warfarin, the international normalized ratio (INR) may not be representative of anticoagulation intensity due to an interaction between LA and the thromboplastin reagent used in the INR determination. In this review, we summarize the use of warfarin/VKA in patients with APS, along with venous and point-of-care INR monitoring. We also discuss the role and monitoring of LMWH/UFH, including in the anticoagulant refractory setting and during pregnancy.

### Anticoagulation therapy in the antiphospholipid syndrome: recent advances [^1155HnSQ]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The antiphospholipid syndrome is currently best treated with anticoagulation. This review discusses the recent literature addressing the duration, intensity, and appropriateness of anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy in various clinical subcategories of this syndrome.

Recent Findings

Several recent articles reaffirm the benefits of long-term anticoagulation in patients with venous thromboembolism or undergoing renal transplantation and support recommendations for usual International Normalized Ratio targets. Aspirin seems to confer benefits similar to those of anticoagulation in arterial stroke. Appropriate anticoagulation strategies for pregnancy are controversial.

Summary

Anticoagulation will remain the mainstay of treatment for most patients with antiphospholipid syndrome. The optimal therapy for specific subgroups of patients will, however, require further good-quality studies.

### Management of thrombotic and obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of antiphospholipid syndrome in adults [^115tbaeG]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This SLR provides a summary of the evidence that informed the EULAR recommendations for the management of both thrombotic and obstetric APS in adults. Data from meta-analyses and cohort studies showed that LDA is effective as primary thromboprophylaxis treatment in aPL-positive individuals. Use of VKA at INR 2–3 is protective against thrombosis recurrences in patients with venous thrombosis. In patients with prior arterial thrombosis, no difference in the risk of new thrombotic events was found between VKA treatment at INR 2–3 and INR 3–4. According to the currently available data, rivaroxaban should not be used in high-risk patients with APS such as those with triple aPL positivity. For patients with either recurrent miscarriages or fetal loss, use of combination treatment with LDA and heparin is more effective than LDA alone.

The main limitation of this SLR is that it included a few high-quality RCTs, primarily due to the rarity of the syndrome and the heterogeneity of APS subsets. Performing RCTs in obstetric APS is even more difficult because of ethical regulations of research involving pregnant women and the reluctance of patients to be randomised during pregnancy. Existing literature is limited by heterogeneous patient groups that may have different outcomes and, importantly, different responses to treatment, including, for example, patients with high-risk aPL profile compared with those with low-risk aPL profile, and patients with arterial versus venous thrombotic events. Stratifying patients by risk is crucial to avoid overtreatment and risk of bleeding in some patients, or undertreatment and risk of thrombotic recurrences in others. In addition, reporting of side effects needs improvement. Bleeding complications must be reported in all studies in order to judge the risks of treatment. In obstetric APS studies, maternal thrombosis during pregnancy or post partum is also important and not only pregnancy outcomes.

### Lack of efficacy of direct oral anticoagulants compared to warfarin in antiphospholipid antibody syndrome [^111QkPvJ]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) have a predictable anticoagulant effect, a rapid onset and offset of action, and fewer drug-drug interactions than vitamin K antagonists (VKA). These compounds have demonstrated similar efficacy and a better safety profile compared to VKA for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE)and for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (FANV)in large randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses.

Patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) require long-term anticoagulation for the secondary prevention of thrombotic events. In this setting, VKA were shown to be more effective than DOACand are therefore recommended by international guidelines. However, the risk of recurrent thrombosis remains high even with VKA treatment, varying from 3% to 24%, and even increasing the intensity of VKA therapy does not reduce the probability of recurrence.

It is clear that adequate anticoagulation therapy still represents a clinical challenge in patients with APS and further investigation is needed before declaring DOAC ineffective. It has been reported that patients with previous arterial or venous manifestation recur with the same type of thromboses and that the risk of recurrence on DOAC is higher in patients with a history of arterial events. Two randomized clinical trials (RCT) comparing DOAC and warfarin in APS have been prematurely interrupted due to the evidence of increased incidence of thrombotic events in the DOAC group, especially strokes. However, it remains unclear whether VKA are more effective than DOAC also in patients with VTE history and no arterial events. The aim of our study was to provide the best evidence from RCT on the risk of major vascular events and bleeding in patients with APS treated with DOAC versus warfarin and to evaluate if patients with no history of arterial thrombosis may be candidate to treatment with DOAC.

### Antiphospholipid antibodies in critical illness [^114JKu1Z]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The antiphospholipid syndrome is defined by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with recurrent venous or arterial thromboembolism or pregnancy morbidity. Antithrombotic therapies are the mainstay of treatment to reduce the risk of recurrent thromboembolism. Among patients with antiphospholipid antibodies, the absolute risk of new thrombosis developing is low in healthy patients without previous thrombotic events. However, the risk of recurrent thrombosis appears to be high in patients with a history of arterial or venous thrombosis. Compared with placebo or untreated control, anticoagulation with warfarin administered to achieve an international normalized ratio of 2.0 to 3.0 probably reduces the risk of recurrence of thrombotic events. Aspirin and moderate-intensity warfarin appear equally effective for preventing recurrent stroke in patients with a single positive antiphospholipid antibody test result and previous stroke. It is unknown how best to prevent first stroke in patients found to be persistently positive for the antiphospholipid syndrome. The catastrophic variant of the antiphospholipid syndrome is a condition characterized by multiple vascular occlusive events, usually affecting small vessels and evolving over a short period of time. This condition has a very high mortality rate. First-line treatment with therapeutic anticoagulation, corticosteroids, plasma exchange, and intravenous immunoglobulin seems to be effective in reducing mortality and risk of catastrophic thrombotic events in these patients. In conclusion, moderate-intensity warfarin is effective for preventing recurrent thrombotic events in patients with venous thrombosis. Aspirin appears to be as effective as moderate-intensity warfarin for preventing recurrent stroke in patients with previous stroke and a single positive test result for antiphospholipid antibody. The optimal treatment of other clinical manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome needs to be addressed in well-designed prospective studies.

### Antiphospholipid syndrome: state of the art on clinical practice guidelines [^116Wi9Vg]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Catastrophic APS

CAPS is a rare but very severe form of APS, characterised by multiorgan failure due to massive small vessel thrombosis, occurring in an estimated < 1% of patients with APS. Data from the international CAPS registry show that treatment with a combination of heparin, corticosteroids, plasma exchange and/or intravenous Ig and, sometimes, rituximab or eculizumab, results in higher survival rates. A proposed algorithm of treatment is provided in figure 2. However, these data are based on a retrospective case series, subjected to inclusion bias. Due to the severity and rarety of the disease, no prospective studies on treatment of CAPS have been undertaken. Complement inhibition may be of added value in the treatment of CAPS, but its position is not well established yet. The recently published international guidelines are largely based on expert opinion.

### Warfarin monitoring in antiphospholipid syndrome and lupus anticoagulant [^116C1Kz2]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the available literature on international normalized ratio (INR) and chromogenic factor X (CFX) monitoring in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), specifically lupus anticoagulant (LA), and furthermore, to identify benefits of one monitoring test compared with the other in the presence of LA.

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted through MEDLINE (1946-May 2014) utilizing the following MeSH terms chromogenic compounds, anticoagulants, and factor X. Further articles were identified from original literature citations.

Study Selection

All English-language studies were included that involved INR and/or CFX monitoring in APS patients that focused on a therapeutic anticoagulation level with warfarin therapy.

Data Synthesis

A total of 55 articles were identified, of which nine are referenced because of their relevance for this review: three articles focus on the efficacy of utilizing INR monitoring in patients with APS, five focus on CFX compared with INR for therapeutic warfarin dosing, and one compares different thromboplastins utilizing both INR and CFX monitoring. INR monitoring in patients with APS, specifically LA, was not found to be reliable because thromboplastin reagents are sensitive to LA. Furthermore, when INR was compared to CFX, patients with LA had supratherapeutic INRs despite having CFX within goal range.

Conclusions

In a subgroup of APS patients, INR monitoring may not be safe for determining the dose of warfarin because their INR values can be falsely elevated. Although CFX monitoring is more accurate, it too comes with its own downsides. Managing warfarin therapy in the APS population needs to be individualized.

### Rivaroxaban versus warfarin to treat patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome, with or without systemic lupus erythematosus (RAPS): a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 2 / 3, non-inferiority trial [^111rYcaH]. The Lancet: Haematology (2016). Medium credibility.

Implications of all the available evidence

Rivaroxaban seems to offer an effective, safe, and convenient alternative to warfarin in patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome who have had previous venous thromboembolism requiring standard-intensity warfarin therapy (ie, target INR 2·5, range 2·0–3·0). The RAPS findings are applicable to this group of patients due to the homogeneity of the study population. An alternative to warfarin would be welcomed by these patients and their treating clinicians, particularly because of issues with variable sensitivity of thromboplastins to lupus anticoagulant and unstable INR needing frequent and unpredictable anticoagulant monitoring. Warfarin is also associated with risks of thrombosis or bleeding due to underanticoagulation and overanticoagulation, respectively. The RAPS trial, however, was designed with a laboratory surrogate outcome measure that reflects the mechanisms of action of the interventions because the large-scale, long-term clinical trials needed to assess recurrent venous thromboembolism are not feasible in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome. The absence of new thrombosis or major bleeding and the low rate of clinically relevant bleeding indicate low risks in the subgroup of patients assessed and puts into context anecdotal reports in case studies and small case series of recurrent thrombosis after switching from warfarin to a direct oral anticoagulant in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome. The small but significant improvement in the quality of life visual analoge score seen with rivaroxaban in RAPS is encouraging. Further studies are needed to define the role of direct oral anticoagulants in the treatment of patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, including those who need higher-intensity anticoagulation after recurrent thrombotic events while they were taking standard-intensity anticoagulation, and those with stroke or other arterial thrombosis.

We did the Rivaroxaban in Antiphospholipid Syndrome (RAPS) trial to investigate whether rivaroxaban would provide anticoagulation non-inferior to that achieved with standard-intensity warfarin in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and previous venous thromboembolism, with or without systemic lupus erythematosus. The studyhas been publishedand is available online.

### Evidence gaps in the era of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants [^111xKE6S]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

There are limited clinical data on the safety and efficacy of NOACs in patients with APS. The rivaroxaban trials (EINSTEIN‐DVT and EINSTEIN‐PE) included a small subset of patients with known thrombophilic conditions (5–7%) including some patients with aPLs. The sample size of those patients is limited and details on the antibody profile or APS status are not available. The results of these studies cannot be generalized to patients with APS. 101 In small case series, dabigatran and rivaroxaban have failed to prevent thrombosis in patients with APS. 101, 102 In RAPS (Rivaroxaban in Anti‐Phospholipid Syndrome), patients with APS and a history of VTE who had been on warfarin (INR range between 2.0 and 3.0) for at least 6 months were randomized to receive rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (or 15 mg once daily if creatinine clearance is 30–49 mL/min, n = 116) or continue warfarin with a target INR of 2.5 (n = 54). The primary outcome was percentage change in endogenous thrombin potential from randomization to day 42. Rivaroxaban failed to reach the noninferiority threshold in reducing endogenous thrombin potential. There was no increase in thrombotic risk in patients treated with rivaroxaban compared with standard‐intensity warfarin, although this small study was not powered for efficacy. 103 There are 3 ongoing clinical trials currently evaluating NOACs in patients with APS. TRAPS (Trial on Rivaroxaban in AntiPhospholipid Syndrome, NCT02157272) is a multicenter, randomized, open‐label study that evaluates whether rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (or 15 mg in patients with moderate renal insufficiency) is noninferior to warfarin (INR target 2.5), for the prevention of thromboembolic events, major bleeding, and death in high‐risk patients with antiphospholipid syndrome. 104 Rivaroxaban for Patients With Antiphospholipid Syndrome (NCT02926170) is a randomized open‐label clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban (20 mg daily) with dose‐adjusted acenocoumarol in patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome who are treated with VKA for at least 6 months. ASTRO‐APS (Apixaban for the Secondary Prevention of Thrombosis among Patients with Antiphospholipid Syndrome, NCT02295475) is a prospective, randomized, open‐label, blinded event pilot study. In this study, patients with antiphospholipid syndrome who have been on anticoagulation for secondary prevention of thrombosis are randomized to receive apixaban 5 mg twice a day or adjusted‐dose warfarin and the safety and efficacy of the 2 strategies will be compared. 105 Until the results of these trials provide evidence of efficacy and safety of NOACs in patients with APS, according to the task force report on antiphospholipid syndrome treatment trends, NOACs should be considered in APS patients with VTE only when there is known VKA allergy, intolerance, or poor anticoagulant control. 90

### Recognition and management of antiphospholipid syndrome [^116xvnHq]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This article summarizes the recent developments in the recognition and management of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).

Recent Findings

Five Task Forces, created as part of the 14th International Congress on antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), published their systematic reviews. 'For the recognition of APS': the assessment of aPL profile is crucial for risk stratification; lupus anticoagulant positivity, especially in the context of 'triple aPL positivity' displays the highest risk; a panel of criteria and noncriteria aPL tests may help better risk-stratify the aPL-positive in the future. 'For the management of APS': direct oral anticoagulants are not currently recommended; statins ameliorate the proinflammator/thrombotic markers, whereas hydroxychloroquine reduces the risk of thrombosis in experimental models and lupus patients, which justify their use as an adjunctive treatment in refractory cases; B-cell inhibition may have a role in difficult-to-treat patients with hematologic and microthrombotic/angiopathic manifestations; and complement and mammalian targets of rapamycin complex pathway inhibition are promising targets in APS.

Summary

Warfarin, heparin, and/or antiplatelet drugs are the standard of care for aPL-positive patients. Recent studies suggest novel approaches that target new coagulation and immunomodulatory pathways; mechanistic and/or controlled clinical studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of these novel approaches.

### Rivaroxaban versus warfarin to treat patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome, with or without systemic lupus erythematosus (RAPS): a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 2 / 3, non-inferiority trial [^112wibGJ]. The Lancet: Haematology (2016). Medium credibility.

The absence of new thrombotic events during 6 months of treatment in RAPS justifies our selection of this subgroup of patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and puts into context anecdotal case reports and findings in small case series of recurrent thrombosis after switching patients from warfarin to a direct oral anticoagulant. Of note, 28% of patients in RAPS had triple positivity for lupus anticoagulant and antibodies against cardiolipin and β 2 GPI at baseline and, therefore, had a particularly high-risk antibody profile.

Our findings suggest that in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome who have had previous venous thromboembolism and need standard-intensity anticoagulation (ie, target INR 2·5) the overall thrombotic risk, based on the overall thrombogram, in-vivo coagulation activation markers and clinical outcomes, is not increased with rivaroxaban compared with that related to warfarin. The absence of new thrombosis or major bleeding and low rate of clinically relevant bleeding supports this conclusion. Further studies are required to define the role of direct oral anticoagulants in antiphospholipid syndrome patients, including those with venous thromboembolism who need higher-intensity anticoagulation (ie, those without recurrent venous thromboembolism while taking standard-intensity anticoagulation) or antiphospholipid syndrome patients with stroke or other arterial thrombosis. Overall, rivaroxaban seems efficacious and safe, and might offer a convenient alternative to warfarin in this subgroup of patients with antiphospholipid syndrome.

### Antiphospholipid syndrome: state of the art on clinical practice guidelines [^116LUvve]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Thrombosis treatment

The mainstay of treatment of thrombotic APS remains vitamin K antagonists, although with recognised limitations especially in the long-term follow-up, failing to prevent recurrent events. Recommendations on treatment of a first thrombotic event, or a second event while on anticoagulation, both for venous and arterial thrombosis, have been published. However, these recommendations are largely based on expert opinion and randomised controlled clinical trials are mostly lacking. Although several reports suggest that additional drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine, rituximab, intravenous Ig and eculizumab, may have a place in the treatment of thrombotic APS, their position in clinical practice is not well defined. Direct acting oral anticoagulants for treatment of APS were investigated with special interest (mainly because of their administration that does not need international normalised ratio (INR) monitoring); these relatively new drugs are considered first-line therapy for atrial fibrillation and deep venous thrombosis in many countries. Unfortunately, at least for rivaroxaban, the efficacy and safety in patients with APS has not been demonstrated.

In patients with APS, long-term anticoagulant treatment is indicated. Treatment withdrawal has been suggested for patients who became antibody negative.

### Management of thrombotic and obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of antiphospholipid syndrome in adults [^116wUEgo]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Duration of anticoagulation in patients with unprovoked venous thrombosis

Use of long-term anticoagulation in patients with APS was supported by two small studies (one RCT, one retrospective cohort study)that showed a lower risk of recurrent events among patients on long-term anticoagulation compared with patients treated with VKA for 3–6 months (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.06 to 1.81) (online supplementary table 4). In the RCT, recurrent venous thromboembolism was reported in three patients (20%) who discontinued VKA at 6 months compared with one (5.3%) on long-term oral anticoagulation over 48 months. The risk of bias was high due to the unblinded design. The report did not comment on bleeding complications.

Three additional indirect studies, each of which reported fewer recurrences in the group that received prolonged anticoagulation, included many patients with arterial events and therefore are not directly applicable to patients with first venous thromboembolism (online supplementary table 4). Studies were not restricted to provoked or unprovoked venous thrombosis. A single treatment arm study reported outcomes of 44 patients with APS who discontinued oral anticoagulation for various reasons. Among 25 patients with solely venous events, recurrent thrombosis occurred in 6 (24%) after discontinuation of oral anticoagulation.

Treatment options for these patients include intensification of anticoagulation with VKA, switch to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or addition of LDA. No studies directly addressed the effectiveness and risks associated with an increase of INR target to 3–4 for patients with recurrent venous thrombosis while anticoagulated to INR 2–3. In one retrospective study, warfarin failure was the reason for switching to LMWH in 9 of 23 patients, but data on patients with venous events specifically were not reported. No patient had recurrent thrombosis on LMWH over a mean follow-up of 36 months, and none had major bleeding. Data from case series indicated no appreciable difference in risk of recurrences between the addition of LDA to VKA versus treatment with VKA alone. However, the timing of addition of LDA was not clearly specified and confounding by indication may have been present.

### Antiphospholipid syndrome and anticoagulation quality: a clinical challenge [^115LPKrM]. Atherosclerosis (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS) is often complicated by ischemic vascular events. Vitamin K Antagonists (VKAs) reduce the risk of recurrent thrombosis. Quality of VKAs treatment, as assessed by the Time in Therapeutic Range (TTR), has never been investigated in APS patients.

Methods

We performed a prospective observational study including 30 APS and 30 Atrial Fibrillation (AF) patients balanced by age and gender. All patients were treated with VKAs (INR target 2.5), and TTR was calculated.

Results

Median TTR of APS was 53.5% vs. 68% of AF patients (p = 0.001). A multivariable linear regression analysis confirmed that the presence of APS (vs. AF) was independently associated with a worse TTR (B: -14.067, 95% Confidence Interval -25.868/-2.266, p = 0.020). The weekly dosage of VKAs was significantly higher in APS than AF patients.

Conclusions

APS patients disclose a lower quality of anticoagulation compared to those with AF, requiring higher doses of VKAs. The efficacy of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants in this high-risk patients should be tested.

### Rivaroxaban versus vitamin K antagonist in antiphospholipid syndrome: a randomized noninferiority trial [^1134wKRo]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The potential role of new oral anticoagulants in antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) remains uncertain.

Objective

To determine whether rivaroxaban is noninferior to dose-adjusted vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for thrombotic APS.

Design

3-year, open-label, randomized noninferiority trial. (EU Clinical Trials Register: EUDRA [European Union Drug Regulatory Authorities] code 2010–019764–36).

Setting

6 university hospitals in Spain.

Participants

190 adults (aged 18 to 75 years) with thrombotic APS.

Intervention

Rivaroxaban (20 mg/d or 15 mg/d, according to renal function) versus dose-adjusted VKAs (target international normalized ratio, 2.0 to 3.0, or 3.1 to 4.0 in patients with a history of recurrent thrombosis).

Measurements

The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients with new thrombotic events; the primary safety outcome was major bleeding. The prespecified noninferiority margin for risk ratio (RR) was 1.40. Secondary outcomes included time to thrombosis, type of thrombosis, changes in biomarker levels, cardiovascular death, and nonmajor bleeding.

Results

After 3 years of follow-up, recurrent thrombosis occurred in 11 patients (11.6%) in the rivaroxaban group and 6 (6.3%) in the VKA group (RR in the rivaroxaban group, 1.83 [95% CI, 0.71 to 4.76]). Stroke occurred more commonly in patients receiving rivaroxaban (9 events) than in those receiving VKAs (0 events) (corrected RR, 19.00 [CI, 1.12 to 321.9]). Major bleeding occurred in 6 patients (6.3%) in the rivaroxaban group and 7 (7.4%) in the VKA group (RR, 0.86 [CI, 0.30 to 2.46]). Post hoc analysis suggested an increased risk for recurrent thrombosis in rivaroxaban-treated patients with previous arterial thrombosis, livedo racemosa, or APS-related cardiac valvular disease.

Limitation

Anticoagulation intensity was not measured in the rivaroxaban group.

Conclusion

Rivaroxaban did not show noninferiority to dose-adjusted VKAs for thrombotic APS and, in fact, showed a non-statistically significant near doubling of the risk for recurrent thrombosis.

Primary and secondary prevention strategies

Antiphospholipid antibody carriers

In subjects with positivity for aPL in the absence of clinical thrombotic events, primary prevention strategy includes cardiovascular risk factors such as arterial hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia and cigarette smoking (Figure 2). Treatment with low-dose aspirin (LDA, 75–100 mg/die) is still controversialand could be considered in patients at high risk, such as those with triple positivity or persistent positivity with medium-high titer of aCL. Recently, the positivity for IgG aPS/PT has been suggested as a marker of thrombotic risk in aPL carriers in addition to triple positivity (Figure 2). Regarding oral anticoagulation, with or without LDA, the quality of evidence is too low to demonstrate benefit or harm of anticoagulant use in aPL carriers.

Figure 2
Summary of antithrombotic treatment options in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and seronegative antiphospholipid syndrome. APS: antiphospholipid syndrome; aPL: antiphospholipid antibodies; aCL: anticardiolipin antibodies; VTE: venous thromboembolism; LDA: low-dose aspirin, LMWH: low molecular weight heparin, UFH: unfractionated heparin; INR: international normalized ratio; EULAR: European League Against Rheumatism.

In women with a high-risk aPL profile but no history of thrombosis or pregnancy complications, treatment with LDA (75–100 mg daily) during pregnancy should be considered according to 2019 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations.

Secondary antiphospholipid syndrome

In APS patients with previous arterial or venous thromboembolism, use of unfractionated or low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) is recommended in the acute phasefollowed by long-term treatment with warfarin, with an international normalized ratio (INR) range between 2–3.

Warfarin therapy in APS has several critical points. Indeed, a recent studyshowed that, in the APS population, the management of anticoagulant therapy is more problematic compared to a population of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Thus, APS patients had a shorter time within the therapeutic range than those with AF (53.5% vs. 68%; P = 0.001) and needed a higher mean weekly dose of warfarin to reach the therapeutic range.

### A discussion of the antiphospholipid syndrome… [^113heonN]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

The term "antiphospholipid syndrome" originally described the clinical association between antiphospholipid antibodies and a syndrome of hypercoagulability. The criteria for diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome and the terminology of the disease have evolved over the years as the relevant pathophysiology and immunology have become better understood. Levine and colleagues discuss antiphospholipid syndrome, an uncommon disease with serious risks of arterial and venous thrombosis as well as recurrent pregnancy loss. The most recent international consensus criteria for diagnosing antiphospholipid syndrome require the presence of a clinical and a laboratory marker of the syndrome before a definitive diagnosis can be made. The most sensitive laboratory test for antiphospholipid syndrome is the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies; however, lupus anticoagulant is a more specific sign.

In large studies, as many as 5 percent of healthy control subjects have at least one of the autoantibodies associated with antiphospholipid syndrome. Most of these persons never develop any thrombotic or obstetric complications. Anti-β. 2-glycoprotein I autoantibodies are another class of autoantibodies strongly associated with the syndrome, but they are not presently included in the consensus criteria. Antibody screening is typically performed in persons with early or recurrent thrombotic episodes. The authors note that the risk of clinical sequelae is most elevated in persons with laboratory evidence of antiphospholipid syndrome and additional risk factors that predispose to thrombosis or atherosclerotic damage to blood vessels. Treatment of the syndrome centers on anticoagulant therapy.

Aspirin may be helpful in preventing fetal loss, but it does not appear to protect against other thrombotic disease. Low-intensity warfarin therapy is also not protective. It remains unclear whether moderate-intensity warfarin therapy is preferable to high-intensity anticoagulation. The review adds that modification of other thrombotic or atherosclerotic risk factors is also important in decreasing the overall risk of clinical complications.

### Monitoring oral anticoagulation may require determination of single coagulation factor activities in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome [^113B5sHe]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

We describe a 32-year-old man with secondary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) who received oral anticoagulation with phenprocoumon after deep vein thrombosis. Conventional monitoring of oral anticoagulation by INR measurement was impaired by coagulation factor inhibition in vitro due to a strong lupus anticoagulant. The case illustrates that monitoring of oral anticoagulation may require determination of single coagulation factor activities in selected patients with APS.

Direct oral anticoagulants have several advantages compared with warfarin. They avoid the need for routine anticoagulation monitoring, which is particularly relevant to antiphospholipid syndrome patients because thromboplastins have variable sensitivity to lupus anticoagulants and, therefore, the INR might not accurately reflect anticoagulation intensity. If INR instability develops, frequent anticoagulant monitoring will be needed with unpredictable time intervals, and the risk of thrombosis or bleeding will be increased due, respectively, to undercoagulation or overcoagulation. The percentage of time in the therapeutic range for patients in the RAPS warfarin group was only 55% up to day 180. This finding highlights that the predictable anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban offers a potential advantage in antiphospholipid syndrome patients, but efficacy is dependent upon adherence to the treatment regimen. Unlike treatment with warfarin, where anticoagulation is constant, rivaroxaban leads to peaks and troughs. No range of therapeutic rivaroxaban concentrations have been defined for clinical use. Population pharmacokinetics indicate that peak rivaroxaban concentrations are in the range 160–360 μg/L.29 (51%) of 57 RAPS patients had peak therapeutic concentrations of at least 160 μg/L, and three of these had concentrations greater than 360 μg/L. Six (11%) patients had peak concentrations lower than 50 μg/L and were possibly non-adherent.

Treatment with VKA vs LDA

In a prospective cohort study of patients with APS with prior ischaemic strokes, the likelihood of recurrent events over 34 months was lower among patients treated with warfarin versus those treated with LDA alone, with a wide CI (RR 0.37; 95% CI 0.05 to 2.47)(online supplementary table 5). INR was not reported. There was no comment regarding bleeding. Methodological quality was intermediate, with incomplete data on outcome assessment and follow-up. Another cohort study of patients with both venous (60%) and arterial (40%) events reported on recurrent thrombosis but not separately for these groups. Recurrences were lower among patients treated with VKA (30.6%) than those treated with LDA (57%). Data on bleeding were not reported. A single treatment arm study reported that three (37.5%) of eight patients with APS and prior ischaemic stroke who were treated with LDA had a recurrent thrombosis over a median of 8.9 years of follow-up. None had major bleeding.

The APASS study compared new cerebrovascular events over 24 months in elderly patients with recent stroke who were aPL positive on one occasion and treated with either LDA or warfarin at target INR 1.4–2.8. Most patients had cardiovascular risk factors (69% ever smoker; 69% hypertension; 32% diabetes). The primary outcome was death or new stroke, although deaths accounted for only a minority of events. Frequency of outcomes was similar between groups. Bleeding was not commented on. The study is not directly relevant because many patients likely did not have definite APS (single aPL measurement, low aPL titres). The relatively low target INR may have minimised differences in recurrences between treatment groups.

### Rivaroxaban versus warfarin to treat patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome, with or without systemic lupus erythematosus (RAPS): a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 2 / 3, non-inferiority trial [^114bArhw]. The Lancet: Haematology (2016). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Rivaroxaban is established for the treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism, but whether it is useful in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome is uncertain.

Methods

This randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 2/3, non-inferiority trial, done in two UK hospitals, included patients with antiphospholipid syndrome who were taking warfarin for previous venous thromboembolism, with a target international normalised ratio of 2·5. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to continue with warfarin or receive 20 mg oral rivaroxaban daily. Randomisation was done centrally, stratified by centre and patient type (with vs without systemic lupus erythematosus). The primary outcome was percentage change in endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) from randomisation to day 42, with non-inferiority set at less than 20% difference from warfarin in mean percentage change. Analysis was by modified intention to treat. Other thrombin generation parameters, thrombosis, and bleeding were also assessed. Treatment effect was measured as the ratio of rivaroxaban to warfarin for thrombin generation. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN68222801.

Findings

Of 116 patients randomised between June 5, 2013, and Nov 11, 2014, 54 who received rivaroxaban and 56 who received warfarin were assessed. At day 42, ETP was higher in the rivaroxaban than in the warfarin group (geometric mean 1086 nmol/L per min, 95% CI 957–1233 vs 548, 484–621, treatment effect 2·0, 95% CI 1·7–2·4, p < 0·0001). Peak thrombin generation was lower in the rivaroxaban group (56 nmol/L, 95% CI 47–66 vs 86 nmol/L, 72–102, treatment effect 0·6, 95% CI 0·5–0·8, p = 0·0006). No thrombosis or major bleeding were seen. Serious adverse events occurred in four patients in each group.

Interpretation

ETP for rivaroxaban did not reach the non-inferiority threshold, but as there was no increase in thrombotic risk compared with standard-intensity warfarin, this drug could be an effective and safe alternative in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and previous venous thromboembolism.

### Seronegative antiphospholipid syndrome: refining the value of "non-criteria" antibodies for diagnosis and clinical management [^112pCFRb]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

In the case of low-quality therapy with warfarin or recurrent thrombosis, two possible therapeutic approaches could be considered. The first is to adopt a higher intensity warfarin therapy with target INR 3–4, which is, however, not current practice given its association with a reduced risk of thrombosis in the majority of patients. A second approach is represented by the addition of LDA to anticoagulation, which should, however, be reserved for high-risk patients, particularly after an arterial thrombotic event.

More recently, non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC) have been investigated in patients with APS with divergent results. Following the results from the Trial on Rivaroxaban in AntiPhospholipid Syndrome (TRAPS), which included triple positive thrombotic APS, rivaroxaban is contraindicated in APS patients with triple aPL positivity. An analysis from the RE-COVER/RE-COVER II and RE-MEDY trials showed similar safety and efficacy of dabigatran in patients with thrombophilia and previous venous thromboembolic events, in whom APS represented the second most common inherited disorders, accounting for 20% of all patients. These results need to be confirmed in real-world studies. A randomized trial investigating the efficacy and safety of apixaban in APS patients is currently ongoing; this study will include patients with both venous and arterial thrombosis. Laboratory testing of NOAC may be useful in patients with APS as no pre-clinical data in this patient population are available.

Recently, new drugs have been administered in APS patients with thrombotic events. A first example is represented by mTOR inhibitors; these were found to reduce the onset of new vascular lesions after transplantation in patients with APS nephropathy. Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab(anti-CD20 agent) and eculizumab(anti-C5 agent) are currently administrated to manage non-criteria symptoms refractory to standard therapy and to add-on in catastrophic APS and kidney transplantation in APS patients, respectively. Despite these findings, the use of these drugs should be avoided due to lack of strong evidence in APS patients; their use could be considered in patients with refractory C-APS, as suggested by EULAR guidelines.

To address this, the Lupus Anticoagulant/Antiphospholipid Antibodies Scientific and Standardization Committee (SSC) chair and co-chairs together with SSC Control of Anticoagulation members propose guidance for healthcare professionals to help them manage APS patients. Uncertainty in this field will be addressed. This guidance will also serve as a call and focus for research.

Discussion

We present the results of the prospective randomized controlled pilot trial reporting rates of thrombosis and bleeding events among TAPS patients receiving either apixaban or warfarin. During the study duration of 12 months, we reported a high rate of thrombotic stroke in 6 patients randomized to apixaban (318 events per 1000 person-years) and in no patients randomized to warfarin. There was no bleeding event in the apixaban arm and 1 major bleeding event in the warfarin arm (rate: 40 events per 1000 person-years). Patients randomized to apixaban reported greater satisfaction with anticoagulation treatment.

Our observations align with those previously reported from prospective randomized clinical trials in TAPS patients comparing VKA to rivaroxaban. Pengo et al conducted a randomized control trial designed to enroll 536 triple-positive TAPS patients (positive for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-β-2-glycoprotein-I antibodies). The DSMB terminated the trial after 7 of 59 patients randomized to rivaroxaban experienced arterial thrombosis compared with none on warfarin. Ordi-Ros et al reported results of a noninferiority randomized control trial comparing rivaroxaban 20 mg daily with warfarin (target INR 2.5 or 3.5 among those with a history of recurrent thrombosis) in TAPS patients. After the study duration of 36 months, the rate of thrombosis was 3.9% in the rivaroxaban group compared with 2.1% in the VKA group (risk ratio 1.83 [95% CI, 0.71–4.76]), and did not meet the predefined noninferiority margin of 1.4. Stroke occurred among 9 patients randomized to rivaroxaban and in no patients randomized to VKA. Based on these results, in May 2019, European and US regulatory agencies changed the labeling of all DOACs to advise against use among patients with APS, especially triple-positive patients.

### How I treat anticoagulant-refractory thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome [^114idxSK]. Blood (2021). Medium credibility.

The standard treatment of thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is lifelong oral anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), generally warfarin. A minority of patients with APS rethrombose despite seemingly adequate anticoagulation. These patients are deemed anticoagulant refractory. The management of anticoagulant-refractory APS is largely empirical and extrapolated from other clinically similar situations. Further options include increased VKA anticoagulation intensity or alternative antithrombotic strategies, including low-molecular-weight heparin, fondaparinux, the addition of antiplatelet therapy, and consideration of vascular options. Patients with anticoagulant-refractory thrombotic APS may have APS-associated thrombocytopenia, which necessitates balancing the risk of recurrent thrombosis vs bleeding to achieve adequate anticoagulation. The multiple mechanisms involved in the generation of the thrombotic phenotype in APS suggest that anticoagulation alone may not control thrombosis. Thus, other modalities, including adjunctive treatment (hydroxychloroquine, statins, and vitamin D) for APS-related thrombosis, merit consideration, as do immunomodulatory therapy and complement inhibition. Patients with APS may have coexistent systemic lupus erythematosus, which adds to the complexity of managing their thromboembolic disease. However, with attention to detail and judicious application of the limited data, it is possible to minimize the morbidity resulting from anticoagulant-refractory thrombotic APS. Multicenter studies are required to guide the sequence of interventions and their comparative efficacy in patients with anticoagulant-refractory thrombotic APS.

### Management of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome… [^113Z2ACm]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

No evidence exists that high-intensity warfarin is more effective than moderate-intensity warfarin. For patients with a single positive antiphospholipid antibody test result and prior stroke, aspirin and moderate-intensity warfarin appear equally effective for preventing recurrent stroke. For long-term treatment of venous thromboembolism, retrospective case series suggested that high-intensity warfarin was more effective than either aspirin or warfarin administered with a target INR of less than 3.
0. 50, 51 However, 2 randomized trials53, 54 have shown that high-intensity warfarin is not better than moderate-intensity warfarin in preventing recurrent thrombosis. Quiz Ref IDIn conclusion, patients with antiphospholipid antibodies and a first episode of venous thrombosis should be treated with warfarin administered to achieve an INR of 2. 0 to 3.
0.

The optimal duration of anticoagulation is uncertain but based on prospective data suggesting a high rate of recurrence after warfarin discontinuation; indefinite anticoagulation is recommended. The treatment of patients who are incidentally found to have an antiphospholipid antibody and have no prior thrombosis has not been adequately studied, except in patients with SLE. Consensus opinion suggests low-dose aspirin may be considered for asymptomatic patients who are not pregnant. 71 The optimal treatment of patients who have antiphospholipid antibodies and non–central nervous system arterial thrombosis is uncertain. Many patients with myocardial infarction and antiphospholipid antibodies are treated empirically with long-term warfarin therapy administered to achieve an INR of 2. 0 to 3.
0. These patients may be treated in the same manner as a patient presenting with new thrombosis without warfarin.

Possible treatment options for recurrent thrombosis despite warfarin in the target INR range include increasing the intensity of warfarin anticoagulation to achieve a higher target INR, switching from warfarin to therapeutic doses of unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin, or adding an antiplatelet agent to warfarin.

### Can we use NOACS in APS? [^116FP3dg]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Secondary thromboprophylaxis with low molecular heparin or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) is recommended in patients with definite antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Direct oral anticoagulant (DOACs) have been approved in different prothrombotic conditions and have numerous advantages compared to VKAs. Whether DOACs can be used for secondary prophylaxis in APS is an open question. Data from the TRAPS randomized controlled Trial, meta-analysis and case reports indicate that we should not treat patients with triple positive APS and/or arterial thrombi with routine doses of DOACS. On the other hand, data from the literature including, case series, meta- analysis and the RAPS trial indicate that there are low risk patients, such as patients who suffered from a venous but not an arterial thromboembolism and are LAC negative who may benefit from the treatment with DOACs. Prospective trials addressing these low risk patients are needed in order to consider DOAC treatment in such patients.

### Antiphospholipid syndrome and recurrent thrombosis – limitations of current treatment strategies [^112w54gp]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a systemic autoimmune disorder that is characterised by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies and a common cause of vascular thromboembolic phenomena. The management of patients with APS is currently directed to antithrombotic medications. The international therapeutic guidelines recommend oral anticoagulation with warfarin indefinitely after the first thrombotic episode. However, therapeutic guidelines lack for a minority group of patients - the patients appropriately anticoagulated with recurrent thromboembolic phenomena. The authors present a clinical report that reveals the therapeutic and diagnostic complexity of this specific group of patients. Regarding recent studies, APS has been revealed as a complex syndrome with multiple pathophysiological mechanisms previously unknown. In this context, new therapeutic approaches have been defended and empirically experienced, with potentially promising results.

### A randomized clinical trial of high-intensity warfarin vs. conventional antithrombotic therapy for the prevention of recurrent thrombosis in patients with the antiphospholipid syndrome (WAPS) [^11343Dkw]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal intensity of oral anticoagulation for the prevention of recurrent thrombosis in patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is uncertain. Retrospective studies show that only high-intensity oral anticoagulation [target international normalized ratio (INR) > 3.0] is effective but a recent randomized clinical trial comparing high (INR range 3.0–4.0) vs. moderate (INR 2.0–3.0) intensities of anticoagulation failed to confirm this assumption.

Methods

We conducted a randomized trial in which 109 patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and previous thrombosis were given either high-intensity warfarin (INR range 3.0–4.5, 54 patients) or standard antithrombotic therapy (warfarin, INR range 2.0–3.0 in 52 patients or aspirin alone, 100 mg day(-1) in three patients) to determine whether intensive anticoagulation is superior to standard treatment in preventing symptomatic thromboembolism without increasing the bleeding risk.

Results

The 109 patients enrolled in the trial were followed up for a median time of 3.6 years. Mean INR during follow-up was 3.2 (SD 0.6) in the high-intensity warfarin group and 2.5 (SD 0.3) (P < 0.0001) in the conventional treatment patients given warfarin. Recurrent thrombosis was observed in six of 54 patients (11.1%) assigned to receive high-intensity warfarin and in three of 55 patients (5.5%) assigned to receive conventional treatment [hazard ratio for the high intensity group, 1.97; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49–7.89]. Major and minor bleeding occurred in 15 patients (two major) (27.8%) assigned to receive high-intensity warfarin and eight (three major) (14.6%) assigned to receive conventional treatment (hazard ratio 2.18; 95% CI 0.92–5.15).

Conclusions

High-intensity warfarin was not superior to standard treatment in preventing recurrent thrombosis in patients with APS and was associated with an increased rate of minor hemorrhagic complications.

### A comparison of two intensities of warfarin for the prevention of recurrent thrombosis in patients with the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome [^112tRD7B]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

Many patients with the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and recurrent thrombosis receive doses of warfarin adjusted to achieve an international normalized ratio (INR) of more than 3.0. However, there are no prospective data to support this approach to thromboprophylaxis.

Methods

We performed a randomized, double-blind trial in which patients with antiphospholipid antibodies and previous thrombosis were assigned to receive enough warfarin to achieve an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 (moderate intensity) or 3.1 to 4.0 (high intensity). Our objective was to show that high-intensity warfarin was more effective in preventing thrombosis than moderate-intensity warfarin.

Results

A total of 114 patients were enrolled in the study and followed for a mean of 2.7 years. Recurrent thrombosis occurred in 6 of 56 patients (10.7 percent) assigned to receive high-intensity warfarin and in 2 of 58 patients (3.4 percent) assigned to receive moderate-intensity warfarin (hazard ratio for the high-intensity group, 3.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.6 to 15.0). Major bleeding occurred in three patients assigned to receive high-intensity warfarin and four patients assigned to receive moderate-intensity warfarin (hazard ratio, 1.0; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.2 to 4.8).

Conclusions

High-intensity warfarin was not superior to moderate-intensity warfarin for thromboprophylaxis in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies and previous thrombosis. The low rate of recurrent thrombosis among patients in whom the target INR was 2.0 to 3.0 suggests that moderate-intensity warfarin is appropriate for patients with the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.

### Management of anticoagulant-refractory thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome [^116MvyHA]. The Lancet: Haematology (2020). High credibility.

Lifelong anticoagulation with warfarin or alternative vitamin K antagonist is the standard anticoagulant treatment for thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome. Anticoagulant-refractory thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome can be broadly defined as breakthrough thrombosis while on standard oral anticoagulation treatment and its management is a major challenge given the serious nature of the thrombotic disease observed, which has become refractory to oral anticoagulation. The factors (genetic and cellular) that cause anticoagulant-refractory thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome are now better understood. However, efforts to use this greater understanding have not yet transformed the capacity to treat it successfully in many patients. In this Viewpoint, we review the factors that are likely to be contributing to the cause of this syndrome and consider how they might be modified or inhibited. We also discuss management, including general strategies to minimise thrombotic risk, intensification of anticoagulation, addition of an antiplatelet agent, adjunctive treatment for thrombosis, immunomodulatory therapy, complement inhibition, vascular options, and future potential therapeutic targets.

### Rivaroxaban vs warfarin in high-risk patients with antiphospholipid syndrome [^112fjVHV]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Rivaroxaban is an effective and safe alternative to warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism. We tested the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban compared with warfarin in high-risk patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome. This is a randomized open-label multicenter noninferiority study with blinded end point adjudication. Rivaroxaban, 20 mg once daily (15 mg once daily based on kidney function) was compared with warfarin (international normalized ratio target 2.5) for the prevention of thromboembolic events, major bleeding, and vascular death in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome. Only high-risk patients triple positive for lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin, and anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibodies of the same isotype (triple positivity) were included in the study. The trial was terminated prematurely after the enrollment of 120 patients (59 randomized to rivaroxaban and 61 to warfarin) because of an excess of events among patients in the rivaroxaban arm. Mean follow-up was 569 days. There were 11 (19%) events in the rivaroxaban group, and 2 (3%) events in the warfarin group. Thromboembolic events occurred in 7 (12%) patients randomized to rivaroxaban (4 ischemic stroke and 3 myocardial infarction), whereas no event was recorded in those randomized to warfarin. Major bleeding occurred in 6 patients: 4 (7%) in the rivaroxaban group and 2 (3%) in the warfarin group. No death was reported. The use of rivaroxaban in high-risk patients with antiphospholipid syndrome was associated with an increased rate of events compared with warfarin, thus showing no benefit and excess risk. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02157272.

### Rivaroxaban vs warfarin in high-risk patients with antiphospholipid syndrome [^116iHvDt]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

The study TRAPS was published by Pengo V and colleagues in 2018 in the journal Blood. This study is related to the following diseases: Antiphospholipid syndrome. In the TRAPS study, the trial question was: is rivaroxaban noninferior to warfarin in high-risk patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome? In the TRAPS study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the TRAPS study, the population was: 120 patients (77 female, 43 male). The inclusion criteria were high-risk patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome. The key exclusion criteria were severe hypersensitivity to rivaroxaban, pregnancy or breast feeding, concomitant treatment with other anticoagulants, major surgical procedure or trauma within 30 days, gastrointestinal bleeding within 6 months of randomization, chronic hemorrhagic disorder, intracranial neoplasm, AVM or aneurysm. In the TRAPS study, the interventions were: n = 59 rivaroxaban (20 mg once daily; 15 mg once daily based on kidney function) n = 61 warfarin (INR target 2.5). In the TRAPS study, the primary outcome was: difference exceeding non-inferiority margin in vascular death, thromboembolic events, or major bleeding (19% vs. 3%; HR 6.7, 95% CI 1.5 to 30.5). In the TRAPS study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in major bleeding (7% vs. 3%; HR 2.5, 95% CI 0.5 to 13.6). In the TRAPS study, the conclusion was: in high-risk patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome, rivaroxaban was not noninferior to warfarin with respect to vascular death, thromboembolic events, or major bleeding.

### Vitamin K antagonist anticoagulation in antiphospholipid syndrome: time in therapeutic range and clinical outcomes [^113i5Qfj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Thrombosis in antiphospholipid syndrome is still frequently treated with vitamin K antagonists, with a target international normalized ratio of 2–3. Time in therapeutic range of international normalized ratio of ≥ 70% is considered optimal. Time in therapeutic range among antiphospholipid syndrome patients is not well documented and the clinical consequences of poor international normalized ratio control are uncertain. This study aimed to determine the proportion of vitamin K antagonist-treated antiphospholipid syndrome patients achieving time in therapeutic range ≥ 70%, to define the features associated with poor control and to determine its association with thrombotic and bleeding events.

Methods

This medical records review included antiphospholipid syndrome patients treated with vitamin K antagonists, between 2012–2023. The proportion of patients achieving a time in therapeutic range ≥ 70% was determined, and thrombotic and bleeding events were compared between patients with time in therapeutic range ​​ ≥ 70% vs < 70%.

Results

Sixty seven antiphospholipid syndrome patients were studied. It was observed that 29.9% achieved time in therapeutic range ≥ 70% and 9.1% of patients with 3 or more comorbidities achieved time in therapeutic range values ≥ 70% compared with 40% of patients with less than 3 comorbidities. Fewer recurrent arterial and overall thrombotic events occurred with time in therapeutic range ​​ ≥ 70%.

Conclusions

A minority of antiphospholipid syndrome patients treated with vitamin K antagonists achieve optimal anticoagulation and are at risk for recurrent thrombotic events, particularly arterial. Presence of multiple comorbidities is associated with poor international normalized ratio control. Careful monitoring of this patient population is warranted.

Antiphospholipid syndrome secondary prevention — direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs): In an open-label, noninferiority randomized controlled trial (RCT), "rivaroxaban was associated with higher risk of thrombotic events", and "a similar result in favor of VKA over rivaroxaban was reported in an open-label RCT of patients with antiphospholipid syndrome". Observational data "also suggest a high risk of recurrent thrombosis among patients with antiphospholipid syndrome who receive DOACs", and the guideline states "we do not recommend the use of DOACs in general and, specifically, rivaroxaban for antiphospholipid syndrome". There is also "a knowledge gap with respect to the role of dual antiplatelets in antiphospholipid syndrome", and "the absence of definitive data prevents us from providing a stronger recommendation at this point".

### Clinical characteristics of patients with acute pulmonary embolism complicated with antiphospholipid syndrome: a case control study [^114mKP2T]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In this study, it was found that the risk factors for APS patients with APE were dyspnea, positive aβ2GPI, and elevated D-dimer. Every APS patient may occur APE during the course of the disease, which may be the result of a combination of risk factors. Anticoagulation therapy in APS patients has been found to reduce the rate of venous and arterial thrombosis and recurrence, as well as the rate of fetal loss. Unlike severe thrombocytopenia, mild/moderate thrombocytopenia (≥ 50 × 10⁹/L) should not interfere with VTE prevention decisions. A cohort study with APS patients suggesting that direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) is less effective and safer than vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in preventing thromboembolism. And anticoagulation therapy is the core of the treatment of thrombotic APS. In terms of anticoagulant drug selection, for patients with first venous thrombosis and definite diagnosis of APS, VKA with target INR2.0–3.0 is recommended, and warfarin has the strongest evidence that it is superior to DOAC for anticoagulation. A meta-analysis showed that factor Xa inhibitors increased the risk of stroke in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome. And current guidelines also recommend that the main treatment for thrombotic APS is long-term anticoagulant therapy with VKA such as warfarin.

The defect of this study is the small sample, retrospective, and the collection of some other indicators was limited, leading to the bias. Additionally, the IgG and IgM subtypes of the positive rate for aβ2GPI were not differentiated, and the differences in recurrence rates or clinical outcomes of APE following anticoagulation therapy were not assessed. Future studies should include further analysis of IgG/IgM antibody subtypes and collect follow-up data to evaluate potential outcome differences after anticoagulation therapy, thereby guiding the selection of appropriate anticoagulation strategies. The clinical characteristics of APS-APE patients need to be further explored in multi-center, large sample, and prospective studies, as well as independent risk factors, with a view to early detection, diagnosis and treatment, and improvement of prognosis.

### Use of direct oral anticoagulants in antiphospholipid syndrome [^115CpbWD]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2018). Low credibility.

The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are therapeutic alternatives to warfarin and other vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), and constitute the standard of care for many indications. VKAs constitute the conventional therapy for the treatment and secondary thromboprophylaxis of thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), but are often problematic, owing to the variable sensitivity of thromboplastins to lupus anticoagulant. Thus, the International Normalized Ratio may not accurately reflect anticoagulation intensity, or be clinically effective. Definition of the current role of DOACs in the treatment of APS is based on limited clinical trial data and information from other sources, including manufacturers' data, case series or cohort studies, and expert consensus. The Rivaroxaban in Antiphospholipid Syndrome (RAPS) randomized controlled trial (RCT), which had a laboratory surrogate primary outcome measure, suggests that rivaroxaban has the potential to be an effective and convenient alternative to warfarin in thrombotic APS patients with a single venous thromboembolism event requiring standard-intensity anticoagulation. However, further studies, in particular to provide better long-term efficacy and safety data, are needed before it can be widely recommended. APS patients are clinically heterogeneous, with the risk of recurrent thrombosis and the intensity of anticoagulation being influenced by their clinical phenotype and risk profile. DOAC trials involving homogeneous thrombotic APS populations, with the antiphospholipid antibody status well defined, will help to optimize the appropriate treatment in APS patient subgroups. Ongoing and emerging DOAC RCTs should provide further information to guide the use of DOACs in APS patients. Optimal identification of APS patients is a key step in working towards improved therapeutic strategies in these individuals.

### Antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents for secondary prevention of stroke and other thromboembolic events in people with antiphospholipid syndrome [^1151Dy8F]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by arterial or venous thrombosis (or both) and/or pregnancy morbidity in association with the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. The prevalence is estimated at 40 to 50 cases per 100,000 people. The most common sites of thrombosis are cerebral arteries and deep veins of the lower limbs. People with a definite APS diagnosis have an increased lifetime risk of recurrent thrombotic events.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents, or both, for the secondary prevention of recurrent thrombosis, particularly ischemic stroke, in people with antiphospholipid syndrome.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (February 2017), CENTRAL (last search February 2017), MEDLINE (from 1948 to February 2017), Embase (from 1980 to February 2017), and several ongoing trials registers. We also checked the reference lists of included studies, systematic reviews, and practice guidelines, and we contacted experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated any anticoagulant or antiplatelet agent, or both, in the secondary prevention of thrombosis in people diagnosed with APS according to the criteria valid when the study took place. We did not include studies specifically addressing women with obstetrical APS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pairs of review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias for the included studies. We resolved any discrepancies through discussion or by consulting a third review author and, in addition, one review author checked all the extracted data.

Main Results

We included five studies involving 419 randomized participants with APS. Only one study was at low risk of bias in all domains. One study was at low risk of bias in all domains for objective outcomes but not for quality of life (measured using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire). We judged the other three studies to be at unclear or high risk of bias in three or more domains. The duration of intervention ranged from 180 days to a mean of 3.9 years. One study compared rivaroxaban (a novel oral anticoagulant: NOAC) with standard warfarin treatment and reported no thrombotic or major bleeding events, but it was not powered to detect such differences (low-quality evidence). Investigators reported similar rates of clinically relevant non-major bleeding (risk ratio (RR) 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 8.33; moderate-quality evidence) and minor bleeding (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.83) for participants receiving rivaroxaban and the standard vitamin K antagonists (VKA). This study also reported some small benefit with rivaroxaban over the standard VKA treatment in terms of quality of life health state measured at 180 days with the EQ-5D-5L 100 mm visual analogue scale (mean difference (MD) 7 mm, 95% CI 2.01 to 11.99; low-quality evidence) but not measured as health utility (MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.10 [on a scale from 0 to 1]). Two studies compared high dose VKA (warfarin) with moderate/standard intensity VKA and found no differences in the rates of any thrombotic events (RR 2.22, 95% CI 0.79 to 6.23) or major bleeding (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.25) between the groups (low-quality evidence). Minor bleeding analyzed using the RR and any bleeding using the hazard ratio (HR) were more frequent in participants receiving high-intensity warfarin treatment compared to the standard-intensity therapy (RR 2.55, 95% CI 1.07 to 6.07; and HR 2.03, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.68; low-quality evidence). In one study, it was not possible to estimate the RR for stroke with a combination of VKA plus antiplatelet agent compared to a single antiplatelet agent, while for major bleeding, a single event occurred in the single antiplatelet agent group. In one study, comparing combined VKA plus antiplatelet agent with dual antiplatelet therapy, the RR of the risk of stroke over three years of observation was 5.00 (95% CI 0.26 to 98.0). In a single small study, the RR for stroke during one year of observation with a dual antiplatelet therapy compared to single antiplatelet drug was 0.14 (95% CI 0.01 to 2.60).

Authors' Conclusions

There is not enough evidence for or against NOACs or for high-intensity VKA compared to the standard VKA therapy in the secondary prevention of thrombosis in people with APS. There is some evidence of harm for high-intensity VKA regarding minor and any bleeding. The evidence was also not sufficient to show benefit or harm for VKA plus antiplatelet agent or dual antiplatelet therapy compared to a single antiplatelet drug. Future studies should be adequately powered, with proper adherence to treatment, in order to evaluate the effects of anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or both, for secondary thrombosis prevention in APS. We have identified five ongoing trials mainly using NOACs in APS, so increasing experimental efforts are likely to yield additional evidence of clinical relevance in the near future.

### Antiphospholipid syndrome management: a 2023 update and practical algorithm-based approach [^114AsxoJ]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an acquired thrombo-inflammatory disease that has morbid and sometimes devastating effects on patients and their families. This review will discuss the most recent international societal treatment guidelines and propose practical management algorithms for various APS sub-types.

Recent Findings

APS represents a disease spectrum. Although thrombosis and pregnancy morbidities are traditional hallmarks of APS, a variety of extra-criteria clinical phenotypes can often be seen, which makes clinical management more challenging. Primary APS thrombosis prophylaxis should take a risk-stratified approach. Although vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or heparin/low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) remain the preferred treatment for secondary APS thrombosis prophylaxis, some international society guidelines support the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in certain circumstances. Careful monitoring and individualized obstetric care with the use of aspirin and heparin/LMWH will improve pregnancy outcomes among pregnant individuals with APS. Treatment of microvascular and catastrophic APS remains challenging. While the addition of various immunosuppressive agents is often utilized, further systemic evaluations of their use are warranted before definitive recommendations can be made. Several new therapeutic strategies are on the horizon that might enable more personalized and targeted APS management in the near future.

Summary

Although the knowledge of APS pathogenesis has grown in recent years, the management principles and strategies are largely unchanged. There is an unmet need for evaluating pharmacological agents, beyond anticoagulants, that target diverse thromboinflammatory pathways.

### Evidence based treatment of the antiphospholipid syndrome II. optimal anticoagulant therapy for thrombosis [^115GibYo]. Thrombosis Research (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

Current consensus recommendations suggest that patients with antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA) are at high risk of recurrent arterial or venous thromboembolism (VTE) despite warfarin administered to achieve an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0. These recommendations have been called into question by three recently reported studies.

Methods

We sought to determine the current "best practice" for the prevention of recurrent TE in patients with APLA and TE. Data was derived from a MEDLINE search and review of recent conference abstracts. The literature search was confined to studies of treatment to prevent recurrent thrombosis in patients with APLA.

Results

The overall proportion of patients suffering recurrent TE when allocated to moderated-intensity warfarin (target INR of 2.0 to 3.0) was 5/113 (4.4%), and it was 11/110 (10.0%) when such patients were randomized to high-intensity warfarin (target INR of 3.0 to 4.0). APLA-positive patients with noncardioembolic/nonatheroembolic stroke appear to have similar risks of recurrent TE whether they are treated with warfarin or aspirin.

Discussion

Patients with APLA and TE have an acceptable rate of recurrent TE if they are treated with usual-intensity warfarin. Patients with APLA and stroke are probably best treated with aspirin, while those with other forms of arterial TE are likely best treated with moderate-intensity warfarin plus aspirin.

Treatment with VKA with INR 2–3 versus INR 3–4

Summary of an earlier SLR showed a lower risk for recurrent thrombosis in patients with high-intensity INR anticoagulation treatment versus those with a target INR of 2–3. Analyses of paired comparisons within studies were not reported. Recurrence risk among patients with first arterial thrombosis was not analysed specifically. One RCT with low risk of bias provided stratified data on patients with arterial thrombosis specifically (table 3). Over a mean of 2.6 years, recurrences were higher among those in the target INR 3–4 group than in the INR 2–3 group (8.6/100 py vs 2.6/100 py) but without statistical significance. Bleeding complications were only reported for the treatment groups as a whole (including patients with either venous or arterial events) and were similar. Another RCT compared patients with APS treated to a high target INR (3–4.5) versus moderate target INR, but only 32% of participants had prior arterial events. Over a median follow-up of 3.6 years, recurrent events occurred more frequently in the high INR group (3.1/100 patient-years (py) vs 1.6/100 py). Major bleeding was slightly less common in the high INR group. Results were not stratified by history of venous or arterial events, so these results are only indirectly related to the treatment of patients with arterial thrombosis. Risk of bias was rated as high (table 3).

Table 3
Studies of intensity of oral anticoagulation treatment in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and previous arterial thrombosis

Two additional indirect comparison studies included a mixture of patients with histories of venous and arterial events. The first study included 39 patients with venous thrombosis and 31 with arterial thrombosis. Recurrent thrombosis was not observed in the subgroup treated with warfarin INR ≥ 3 while the rate was 7/100 py in the subgroup of INR 2–3. Methodological quality was intermediate. In the second study of patients with APS with history of thrombosis (54% venous; 46% arterial at diagnosis), recurrent thrombosis was less frequent among patients treated with VKA at INR ≥ 3 than those with INR < 3 (63). All bleeding complications occurred in the high-intensity group (any bleeding 7.1/100 py; major bleeding 1.7/100 py) (table 3). Data from mixed treatment and single treatment arm studies showed substantial variability in thrombosis recurrence(online supplementary table 6).

### Anticoagulant and non-anticoagulant therapy in thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome: old drugs and new treatment targets [^116Phbao]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

In this review, we discuss the current evidence on classic and newer oral anticoagulant therapy, older drugs such as HCQ and statins, and new potential treatment targets in APS. Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) remain the cornerstone treatment for thrombotic events in APS. In patients fulfilling criteria for definite APS presenting with a first venous thrombosis, treatment with VKAs with a target international normalized ratio (INR) 2.0–3.0 is recommended. In patients with arterial thrombosis, treatment with VKA with target INR 2.0–3.0 or 3.0–4.0 is recommended by recent guidelines, considering the individual's bleeding and thrombosis recurrence risk. A combination of VKAs and low-dose aspirin (75–100mg/daily) may also be considered. According to available evidence direct oral anticoagulants should be avoided in patients with arterial thrombosis and/or those with triple aPL positivity. Adjunctive treatment with HCQ and/or statins can be considered, especially in anticoagulation treatment-refractory APS. Potential targeted treatments in APS include B-cell targeting, complement inhibition, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition, IFN targeting, adenosine receptors agonists, CD38 targeting or chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. The safety and efficacy of these treatment targets needs to be examined in well-designed randomized controlled trials.

### Direct oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1146rRB5]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an acquired autoimmune disease defined by the association of thromboembolic events (venous, arterial or microvascular) and/or pregnancy morbidity and the persistent presence of antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies, such as lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin and anti-β2-glycoprotein 1. Triple-positive patients, who show a worse prognosis, represent less than 50% of those positive for one or two tests. A previous systematic review suggests that aPL antibodies were detected in 6% of women with pregnancy morbidity, in 13.5% of patients with stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA), 11% with myocardial infarction (MI) and 9.5% with deep vein thrombosis. Therefore, being thromboembolic diseases of major concern due to their high prevalence and often fatal consequences, the diagnosis and prognosis of APS should not be underestimated and treated accordingly.

Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) have been the gold standard in the primary and secondary prevention of thromboembolic events in APS. The target international normalised ratios (INR) interval should be between 2.0 and 3.0, but long-term treatment is a great medical challenge in these patients, particularly due to the risk of major bleeding.

Another class of anticoagulants, the non-vitamin K antagonists oral anticoagulants (NOACs), also called direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), have been used in many countries worldwide in the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) as well as in stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. DOACs include drugs such as apixaban, edoxaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban.DOACs revealed several advantages over VKA: lower incidence of major bleeding, minor drug and food interactions, rapid onset (and also offset) of action, more predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and lack of need for laboratory monitoring with higher patients' satisfaction.

On the other hand, the data and the experience in this area are limited and heterogeneous increasing the uncertainty about the use of DOACs in APS.

Therefore, we aimed to perform a systematic review to compare DOACs to VKA regarding prevention of thromboembolic events, occurrence of bleeding events and mortality in patients with APS.

### Warfarin monitoring and interference by lupus anticoagulant in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome [^115ctVZZ]. Thrombosis Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) receive vitamin K antagonists, which warrants international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring. Research has indicated that presence of lupus anticoagulant (LA) can interfere with INR results obtained by point-of-care testing (POCT) devices. We aimed to investigate whether a systematic difference exists between POCT-INR and plasma-INR in patients with APS.

Materials and Methods

We compared 291 paired POCT- and plasma-INR results from 52 LA-positive APS patients receiving warfarin with each patient having a minimum of three paired measurements of paired POCT-INR (CoaguChek, Roche Diagnostics) and plasma-INR. Agreement limits were considered satisfactory if differences were within ± 0.4 INR for plasma-INR < 2.0, within ± 20% for plasma-INR 2.0 to 3.5, within ± 20% for plasma-INR > 3.5 to 4.5, within ± 25% for plasma-INR > 4.5 to 6.0 and within ± 30% for plasma-INR > 6.0.

Results

A strong positive correlation was found between POCT- and plasma-INR, Spearman's rho (95% CI) = 0.72 (0.65–0.78), p < 0.001. The average bias was 0.1 INR (3.7%), p < 0.001. 79% of paired INR results met the agreement limits with 67% of the diverging POCT-INRs being from a subset of five patients, who had consistently higher POCT- than plasma-INR.

Conclusions

The majority of LA-positive APS patients had no clinically significant difference between POCT-INR and plasma-INR. However, in a subset of patients, clinically significant systematic differences were found. Consequently, systematic comparison of a minimum three paired POCT- and plasma-INR results is recommended before implementing POCT-INR monitoring in LA-positive APS patients.

### Rivaroxaban versus warfarin to treat patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome, with or without systemic lupus erythematosus (RAPS): a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 2 / 3, non-inferiority trial [^112Prvzv]. The Lancet: Haematology (2016). Medium credibility.

Patients

Eligible patients had thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome (appendix p 3)and at least one venous thromboembolism when taking no or subtherapeutic anticoagulant therapy (appendix p 3), and had been taking standard-intensity warfarin (target international normalised ratio [INR] 2·5) for at least 3 months since the last venous thromboembolic event. Women had to be using adequate contraception (appendix p 3) unless they were postmenopausal or had undergone sterilisation.

We excluded patients with previous arterial thrombotic events (appendix pp 3, 4) due to antiphospholipid syndrome or recurrent venous thromboembolism when taking warfarin at a therapeutic INR of 2·0–3·0 and those who were younger than 18 years. Other exclusion criteria were pregnancy or lactation; severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance calculated with the Cockcroft and Gault formula, ≤ 29 mL/min); alanine aminotransferase more than twice the upper limit of normal; Child-Pugh class B or C cirrhosis; thrombocytopenia (platelets < 75 × 10⁹/L); non-adherence to warfarin regimen (based on clinical assessment); taking azole class antifungals, protease inhibitors (eg, ritonavir) for HIV, strong CYP3A4 inducers (eg, rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or St John's wort), or dronedarone; and refusal to give consent for the study site to inform a family doctor or health-care professional responsible for anticoagulation care about participation.

All patients enrolled met the international consensus criteria for antiphospholipid syndrome, with testing for antiphospholipid antibodies done in accordance with national and international guidelines (appendix pp 6, 7). All patients with systemic lupus erythematosus were classified according to the revised criteria of the American College of Rheumatologistsand reviewed in lupus clinics by experienced clinicians, according to standard activity and damage assessment indices, although the results were not part of this study.

We did not apply any performance status criteria for trial entry, and all patients included in the trial were outpatients. We did not anticipate that mortality during follow-up would differ from that in the general population.

### Apixaban compared with warfarin to prevent thrombosis in thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome: a randomized trial [^115rk4xo]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is characterized by thrombosis involving the venous, arterial or microcirculation, pregnancy morbidity, and persistent characteristic antibodies. Patients with APS and thrombosis (thrombotic APS-TAPS) are at high risk for recurrent thrombosis, and indefinite anticoagulation is recommended. A vitamin K antagonist (VKA) such as warfarin is the historically preferred treatment of thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome (TAPS) patients. However, the use of VKA is complicated by diet and multiple drug interactions and the need for frequent phlebotomy for dose adjustment. In addition, the rate of recurrent thrombosis among TAPS patients on warfarin remains high and approximates 25% within 5 years. The direct anticoagulant (DOAC) apixaban is a safe and effective alternative to VKA for the treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE)and is likewise effective in another hypercoagulable group, patients with cancer. Initial reports of DOAC administration among TAPS patients were encouraging. However, subsequent studies comparing rivaroxaban with VKA in TAPS patients suggested that rivaroxaban may be inferior to VKAfor preventing recurrent thrombosis, especially ischemic strokes. Because of these observations, guidance from regulatory agenciesand medical societieshas emerged to recommend against the routine use of DOACs among patients with TAPS. However, the safety and efficacy of apixaban have not been reported in randomized control trials among TAPS patients.

We aimed to compare apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily with warfarin among TAPS patients using a prospective open-label blinded event (PROBE) study design. Our rationale for choosing apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily has been reported elsewhere. Briefly, this was based upon the comparative effectiveness of apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily and apixaban 5 mg twice daily among patients receiving extended phase treatment of VTE, with a favorable relative risk for the outcome of cardiovascular death, stroke, and myocardial infarction when compared with placebo.

This pilot study was to randomize 200 TAPS patients to receive apixaban or warfarin and to report the outcomes of clinically overt thrombosis (venous and arterial thrombosis), bleeding events (major bleeding and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding), and patient satisfaction with anticoagulation.

### Therapy with direct oral anticoagulants for secondary prevention of thromboembolic events in the antiphospholipid syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^1164VyCz]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Lifelong treatment with VKA implies frequent monitoring of INR and may be experienced as a burden by the patient, as indicated by scientific studies demonstrating a decrease in quality of life. Furthermore, the dose–response relationship between coumarins and INR is affected by many factors including dietary habits, genetic interactions, drug interactions, etc, which may increase the risk of bleeding including life-threatening episodes.

DOACs are recommended for secondary prophylaxis in patients with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism not related to APS, and it is relevant to explore the potential of DOACs in secondary prevention of thromboembolic events in APS. If DOACs could replace VKA, partially or completely, we hypothesise that it could potentially reduce the risk of bleeding episodes and change the patient's perception of own illness. In 2016–2017, two authorsshowed positive case reports on 23 and 24 patients with APS, respectively, treated with DOAC for secondary prophylaxis.

In 2021, a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) by Dufrost et al found a significantly higher risk of recurrent AT, but not for VT, when comparing DOACs with VKA for secondary prophylaxis. The same year, Aibar and Schulman published a meta-analysis on RCTs and cohorts comparing any antithrombotic regimen in APS, and found that VKA was more effective than DOAC (relative risk (RR): 0.25; 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.93) to prevent recurrent AT. Both concluded that DOACs should not be used for patients with APS with a history of AT. Khairani et al confirmed this including four RCTs and emphasised that patients with thrombotic APS on DOACs compared with VKA have increased risk of AT. Recently, Shah et al also found increased risk of stroke among patients with APS treated with DOACs and calculated RRs that may indicate DOACs to be associated with higher risks of thrombotic events. In the present meta-analysis, we included data from all five present RCTs on patients with APS published 2016–2022 as seen below.

Objectives

Our objectives were to examine whether DOACs reduce the incidence of secondary APS-related AT and VT, by reviewing randomised trials that assess the efficacy and safety of these drugs for secondary prophylaxis in patients with APS.

### Direct oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114vXGaD]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

In contrast to atrial fibrillation treatment, where VKA demonstrated to be less efficacious and safe, the reason behind DOACs failure in APS is still not consensual. Unlike VKA, they target only one coagulation factor, either Xa or IIa, and whether directed anticoagulation is sufficient or not in patients with APS remains unclear. Theoretically, and having in mind the pathophysiology of this syndrome, the presence of aPL antibodies constitutes one plausible justification since they can interfere with the normal pharmacokinetics of these drugs. Due to the fact that aPL antibodies increase lag time and time to peak thrombin generationand lead to platelet hyperactivationand fibrinolysis impairment, they might be responsible for DOACs' resistance in APS. Other possible drawbacks are suboptimal drug concentration demonstrated in animal models, as well as the short drug half-life that may lead to a fast decline of anticoagulation effect and treatment failure if administrations are missed.

Although meta-analyses on this topic have recently been published, our systematic review, in comparison, offers relevant advantages. Our focus was exclusively on patients with APS, without limiting TE events to either arterial, venous or microvascular. We included RCTs, which are known to better establish the causality between drugs and outcomes, and also observational studies, whose results provided data on all four existing DOACs and less strict APS population. Our pooled data also provide objective measure of the DOACs risk in APS as results achieved statistical significance concerning TE events, supporting some expert consensus.

There are some limitations regarding our review that should be taken into account. First, not all included studies were clear about using or not the revised Sapporo criteriain diagnosing APS. To overcome this limitation, we performed a subgroup analysis that did not show differences between studies with more or less restringing inclusion criteria. Second, approximately 67% of our population was on rivaroxaban, which could bias our conclusions. Indeed, in the subgroup analysis, in studies with heterogeneous use of DOACs the significant effect of TE events was lost. Third, the grade of certainty of our results is very low, due to methodological issues of the studies analysed. However, the inclusion of observational studies is important and offers some relevant advantages, such as a more diversified DOACs samples and the use of well-defined inclusion criteria, contributing for a more homogeneous population.

### Direct oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115iVGY1]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

This is the best evidence available and until more robust evidence is published, physicians need to choose which drug benefits the most their patients based on this reality.

Currently, two more RCTs are ongoing: ASTRO-APS (apixaban for secondary prevention of TE among patients with APS) and RISAPS (rivaroxaban for patients who had stroke with APS, with or without SLE, follows the results of RAPS trial, with estimated completion dates for 2021 and 2023, respectively. The ASTRO-APS will include only a strict set of patients with APS with history of venous TE. In this study, patients with previous arterial thrombosis were excluded as these events may be a marker of higher thrombogenicity, recurrent events and potential DOACs treatment non-response. The RISAPS trial aims to study higher intensity anticoagulation with rivaroxaban (15 mg, two times a day, a dose recommended for the acute treatment of VTE) and warfarin (target INR 3.5) — these being the novelties of this study.

Notwithstanding our data, the ongoing trials, despite the existing differences in the population (stricter in ATRO-APS), will inform more robustly about the possible class effect of DOACs in APS. The need of further trials depends on these results.

In conclusion, our review suggests that DOACs use, particularly rivaroxaban, among patients with APS, appears to be less effective than VKA, since it is associated with increased risk of thromboembolic events. In fact, some authorsreport patients, mostly triple-positive, who experienced catastrophic APS — microthromboses involving at least three organs within a week — after rivaroxaban introduction. Despite our results advising against DOACs, particularly rivaroxaban, judgements concerning other DOACs should be more watchful considering the ongoing trials, namely ASTRO-APS, that might provide additional data on this regard and consequently change the present approach to this class of drugs in patients with APS.

### Diagnosis and treatment of antiphospholipid syndrome… [^113AmMDo]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Obstetrics & Gynecology. Diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome is based on a combination of clinical history and laboratory testing. Initial diagnosis requires testing for lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies; patients should be diagnosed if lupus anticoagulant is present or if medium to high levels of immunoglobulin G or IgM anticardiolipid antibodies are present. Positive test results must be confirmed by a second test after several weeks. Testing for antiphospholipid antibodies should be limited to women with appropriate medical or obstetric histories. Treatment of antiphospholipid syndrome during pregnancy reduces the risks of pregnancy loss, preeclampsia, placental insufficiency, preterm birth, and thrombosis. ACOG states that women with antiphospholipid syndrome and no history of thrombosis should receive prophylactic doses of heparin and low-dose aspirin during pregnancy and for six to eight weeks postpartum.

For women with recurrent miscarriage, the combination of prophylactic heparin and low-dose aspirin may reduce pregnancy loss and is more effective than low-dose aspirin alone or prednisone. Although ACOG found few data on the effectiveness of treatments for women with severe preeclampsia or uteroplacental insufficiency, prophylactic heparin and aspirin generally are recommended. Initiation of heparin before conception is not supported by evidence. Women with antiphospholipid syndrome and a history of thrombosis should receive full heparin anticoagulation throughout pregnancy and for six to eight weeks postpartum to minimize the risk of maternal thromboembolism. This can be achieved safely with warfarin after delivery. The benefit of adding aspirin is unknown. After the postpartum period, patients should be referred to a physician with expertise in treating the syndrome for further anticoagulation therapy.

The effectiveness of corticosteroids and intravenous immune globulin for the treatment of antiphospholipid syndrome is uncertain. Women with antiphospholipid syndrome who are pregnant should be instructed about the signs and symptoms of preeclampsia and thrombosis and should be examined frequently. Serial ultrasonic assessment should be considered because of the risk for growth restriction. Antepartum testing should be considered after 32 weeks' gestation.

### Rivaroxaban versus warfarin to treat patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome, with or without systemic lupus erythematosus (RAPS): a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 2 / 3, non-inferiority trial [^1152mcit]. The Lancet: Haematology (2016). Medium credibility.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched MEDLINE and PubMed with the following phrases: "antiphospholipid syndrome", "systemic lupus erythematosus", "venous thromboembolism", "new oral anticoagulants", "novel oral anticoagulants", "direct acting oral anticoagulants", "direct inhibitors of coagulation", "non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants", "warfarin", "coumadin", "vitamin K antagonists", "dabigatran", "rivaroxaban", "apixaban", "edoxaban", "thrombin generation", and "in vivo coagulation activation markers". Further information was also requested from the manufacturers of the individual direct oral anticoagulants. Thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome is a potentially fatal and devastating disorder. Although the disorder is rare, antiphospholipid antibodies are thought to be present in 10% of patients with deep vein thrombosis, suggesting possible underdiagnosis of thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome. Warfarin and other vitamin K antagonists are the standard of care for the secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome. These drugs, however, can be particularly problematic in patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome because of variable sensitivity of thromboplastins to lupus anticoagulant, which is present in many of these patients. Consequently, the international normalised ratio (INR), which is used to monitor warfarin treatment, might not accurately reflect anticoagulation intensity. Two randomised controlled trials in thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome have reported no benefits with high-intensity versus standard-intensity warfarin in the prevention of recurrent thrombosis. Rivaroxaban and other direct oral anticoagulants are effective and safe compared with warfarin for the treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism. Although antiphospholipid antibody status was not systematically documented in randomised controlled trials of direct oral anticoagulants, it is likely that patients with antiphospholipid syndrome were included. In the Rivaroxaban in Antiphospholipid Syndrome (RAPS) non-inferiority trial, therefore, we aimed to confirm the usefulness of rivaroxaban in secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome.

### Thrombosis and the antiphospholipid syndrome [^111bVYfm]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

The antiphospholipid syndrome is an antibody-mediated hypercoagulable state characterized by recurrent venous and arterial thromboembolic events. Several studies have determined that the frequency of antiphospholipid syndrome in patients presenting with a venous thromboembolic event is between 4% and 14%. Because of the high risk for recurrent thromboembolism in these patients, current recommendations suggest a longer, potentially lifelong, course of antithrombotic therapy following an initial event. Although most authorities agree on an extended course of therapy, considerable controversy surrounds the optimal target therapeutic INR for patients with antiphospholipid syndrome. For an initial venous thromboembolic event, a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 is supported by two prospective, randomized clinical trials. In contrast, relatively limited data exist for an initial arterial thromboembolic event in patients who have the antiphospholipid syndrome, and therapeutic recommendations range from aspirin to warfarin with a high target INR. Recurrent thromboembolic events can be extremely difficult to treat, and some patients may benefit from the addition of immunosuppressive therapies. Importantly, as many as 50% of the initial thromboembolic events sustained by patients with antiphospholipid antibodies occur in the setting of additional, coincident prothrombotic risk factors, indicating the importance of addressing any additional risk factors, such as hypercholesterolemia, in these patients. Prospective studies are needed to address the role of thromboprophylactic strategies in asymptomatic individuals with antiphospholipid antibodies in the absence of additional risk factors.

Secondary thromboprophylaxis in APS

Patients with definite APS and first venous thrombosis

Treatment with VKA at conventional versus high-intensity anticoagulation

One double-blind RCT with low risk of bias presented stratified results on patients with prior venous thrombosis specifically(table 2). Recurrent thrombosis was more frequent in those in the higher intensity (target international normalised ratio (INR) 3–4) warfarin group than in the INR 2–3 group over a mean follow-up of 2.6 years. However, in the group of patients with a target INR 2–3, the INR was above the target range 11% of the time, within range 71% of the time and below range 19% of the time. In the high-intensity group, the corresponding figures were 17%, 40% and 43%.

Table 2
Studies of intensity of oral anticoagulation treatment in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and previous venous thrombosis

Pooled data including this RCTand four indirect comparison studies (one RCT, two retrospective cohorts, one prospective cohort)of variable quality did not indicate a difference in risk of recurrent thrombosis between patients on treatment with VKA with a target INR 2–3 and patients with a target INR > 3 (RR 0.67 (95% CI 0.05 to 8.20), with high heterogeneity among studies, I² = 82%) (table 2). The indirect studies included patients with either prior venous or arterial thromboses; the proportion with venous thromboses ranged from 54% to 74% (26–29). High-intensity INR was not significantly associated with an increased risk of major bleeding (RR 1.61; 95% CI 0.34 to 7.56); however, data on bleeding complications were not reported for patients with venous thrombosis specifically in any study.

Nine single treatment arm studiesreported on risks of recurrent thrombosis in cohorts treated with either higher INR targets or conventional INR targets only (online supplementary table 2). Risks in these studies substantially overlapped although appeared to be somewhat lower in the higher INR target studies.

### Management of thrombotic and obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of antiphospholipid syndrome in adults [^112igXx2]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To perform a systematic literature review (SLR) informing the European Lmmendations for the management of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) in adults.

Methods

A SLR through January 2018 was performed. Research questions were constructed using the Patient, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome (PICO) format. We included data from articles that reported on each relevant intervention. Summary effect estimates were calculated for direct comparison studies that matched the PICO question exactly, and for studies with the relevant intervention and comparator. When meta-analyses were available, we used these estimates.

Results

From 7534 retrieved articles (+15 from hand searches), 188 articles were included in the review. In individuals with high-risk antiphospholipid antibody (aPL) profile without prior thrombotic or obstetric APS, two meta-analyses showed a protective effect of low-dose aspirin (LDA) against thrombosis. Two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and three cohort studies showed no additional benefit of treatment with vitamin K antagonists at target international normalised ratio (INR) 3–4 versus INR 2–3 in patients with venous thrombosis. In patients with arterial thrombosis, two RCTs and two cohort studies showed no difference in risk of recurrent thrombosis between the two target INR groups. One open-label trial showed higher rates of thrombosis recurrences in triple aPL-positive patients treated with rivaroxaban than those treated with warfarin. RCTs and cohort studies showed that combination treatment with LDA and heparin was more effective than LDA alone in several types of obstetric APS. SLR results were limited by the indirect evidence and the heterogeneity of patient groups for some treatments, and only a few high-quality RCTs.

Conclusion

Well-designed studies of homogeneous APS patient populations are needed.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^113djaSV]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Antiphospholipid syndrome — Evidence and testing considerations for secondary stroke prevention: In a WARSS (Warfarin-Aspirin Recurrent Stroke Study) subgroup, investigators found no differential stroke risk reduction in people with a 1-time positive antiphospholipid antibody with warfarin (RR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.75–1.31]) or aspirin (RR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.70–1.28]; treatment-by-antiphospholipid interaction, P = 0.91), and therefore aspirin is more preferable than warfarin because of the lower risk of bleeding with aspirin. Approximately 13% of patients with antiphospholipid syndrome have stroke as the initial clinical manifestation of the disease. In patients with cryptogenic stroke and a history of thrombosis or rheumatological disease, it would seem reasonable to consider testing for antiphospholipid antibodies, whereas in older populations with increasing frequency of vascular risk factors, there is no evidence supporting the systematic testing for antiphospholipid antibodies. Although no trials of antithrombotic intervention have been performed exclusively in stroke patients, the available evidence favors anticoagulation with VKA compared with aspirin to reduce recurrent arterial thromboses; an INR with a target range of 2 to 3 is preferable over an INR with a target range > 3, and when anticoagulation has been tested against aspirin, an INR of 2 to 3 is a typical range to be used as a comparison arm. Limited evidence also notes that in a small (N = 20) RCT comparing a single-antiplatelet arm versus a triple-therapy arm (dual antiplatelets plus anticoagulation), participants with single antiplatelets had a higher risk of recurrent stroke (log-rank test, P = 0.026) with similar rates of hemorrhage during a mean follow-up of 3.9 years, and the clinical consensus favors using only anticoagulation.

### Kidney disease in antiphospholipid antibody syndrome: risk factors, pathophysiology and management [^113smGru]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLS) is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by recurrent arterial and venous thromboembolic events, pregnancy related complications as well as the persistent detection of antiphospholipid antibodies at a 12 week interval. Renal complications tend to occur in 3% of APLS patients, with renal artery stenosis being the most common kidney related complication. Renal pathology may be subdivided into macro as well as microvascular thrombotic complications with stenosis, thrombosis and infarction representing the principle macrovascular events and APLS nephropathy representing the predominant microvascular complication. APLS related kidney disease may present with an array of heterogenous manifestations ranging from hematuria and non-nephrotic range proteinuria to hypertension or as part of a severe, life threatening and fulminant multiorgan failure disorder known as catastrophic antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (CAPS). Management of APLS related renal complications depends on the site of vascular injury, the thromboembolic risk profile based on the subtype, isotype and titer of the autoantibodies as well as the severity of the injury. Primary prophylaxis in these patients primarily revolves around the use of low dose aspirin, with prophylactic anticoagulation during events that increase thromboembolic like surgery and hospitalization. Anticoagulation is the cornerstone of treatment of APLS related kidney disease with INR targets varying depending on the associated venous or arterial thrombosis. Immunosuppression with the likes of rituximab, mTOR inhibitors, eculizumab and belimumab have been used with some success, but lack randomized control trial validation for their use. Pulsed corticosteroids with Plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulins is the recommended treatment for CAPS.

Antiphospholipid syndrome — Recommendations for patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA): Class 1 (B-NR) states that in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA who have an isolated antiphospholipid antibody but do not fulfill the criteria for antiphospholipid syndrome, antiplatelet therapy alone is recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke; Class 2a (C-LD) states that in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA who meet the criteria for the antiphospholipid syndrome, it is reasonable to anticoagulate with warfarin to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke or TIA; Class 2a (B-R) further states that in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA with confirmed antiphospholipid syndrome treated with warfarin, it is reasonable to choose a target INR between 2 and 3 over a target INR > 3 to effectively balance the risk of excessive bleeding against the risk of thrombosis; and Class 3: Harm (B-R) states that in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA, antiphospholipid syndrome with history of thrombosis and triple-positive antiphospholipid antibodies (ie, lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti–β2 glycoprotein-I), rivaroxaban is not recommended because it is associated with excess thrombotic events compared with warfarin.

### New treatments for antiphospholipid syndrome [^111aVQ4y]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Challenges in new drug development for APS include the controversy about the strength of association between aPL and thrombotic events, and unknown mechanism of aPL-induced thrombosis. In the long-term management of patients who have APS, controlled studies with warfarin alternatives (such as antiplatelet agents), the new anticoagulant agents (such as direct and indirect thrombin inhibitors), and newer therapeutic agents are vital. It is highly possible that the current "antithrombotic" approach to patients who are aPL-positive will be replaced by a "more specifically targeted, anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory" approach in the future.

### High intensity anticoagulation in the prevention of the recurrence of arterial thrombosis in antiphospholipid syndrome:' PROS' and' CONS' [^111hgo2j]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

The use of high intensity anticoagulation in the prevention of recurrence of arterial thrombosis related to the Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS) is still controversial. This paper reports a debate that took place at the CORA meeting (Controversies in Rheumatology and Autoimmunity), held in Florence in March 2011. Major points of discussion were: 1) the paucity of prospective randomized clinical trials; retrospective studies were the main source supporting the use of high intensity anticoagulation; 2) heterogeneity in antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) definition, due to the lack of standardization of aPL assays and to the failure to distinguish patients with a high risk profile ("triple positive") from those a low risk profile; 3) bleeding is a major concern about high intensity anticoagulation; however, studies are not concordant in reporting an increased risk compared to the standard regimen; 4) practical issues consist of difficulties in keeping a stable PT-INR over 3 and the possibility for interference by aPL on the thromboplastins used for PT-INR measurement. In conclusion, there is currently a lack of consensus on the use of high intensity anticoagulation for the secondary prophylaxis of arterial thrombosis. However, such a treatment may be particularly recommended in those APS patients who have a high risk aPL profile and other concomitant cardiovascular risk factors, provided that the potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleeding.

### Would you use novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) for thromboprophylaxis in patients with an underlying hypercoagulable state? A literature review through a case report [^114zPpSJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS) is an autoimmune condition that predisposes to venous and arterial thrombosis. Warfarin is the agent of choice for anticoagulation. However, a need for routine international normalised ratio (INR) checks and multiple drug interactions are some of the difficulties with warfarin. Currently, there is mixed evidence for and against the use of novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) for thromboprophylaxis. We present a case report of a patient with APLS on a NOAC for secondary thromboprophylaxis who developed a stroke and discuss current evidence regarding the use of NOACs in patients with APLS. The patient was switched to warfarin for secondary thromboprophylaxis with an INR goal of 2–3. Literature review revealed mixed case reports for and against NOACs for secondary prevention of thrombotic events in patients with APLS. There needs to be further randomised controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy of NOACs for thromboprophylaxis in patients with APLS.

### Antiphospholipid antibodies increase thrombotic events… [^112ZTVRy]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question: What is the optimal management of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Setting: Various Study Design: Systematic review Synopsis: Antiphospholipid antibodies are associated with an increased risk of thrombotic events and fetal loss. To fully evaluate this risk and potential treatments, the investigators systematically searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and reference lists from significant articles for randomized trials and cohort studies reporting on patients with antiphospholipid antibodies. The risk of developing a new thrombosis in otherwise healthy patients with antiphospholipid antibodies without previous thrombotic events is low.

Among other patients with antiphospholipid antibodies, the risk of a new thrombotic event is moderately increased in women with recurrent fetal loss without previous thrombosis, and it is highest in patients with a history of venous thrombosis who have discontinued anticoagulant drugs in the previous six months. Moderate-intensity anticoagulation significantly reduces the risk of recurrent thrombosis; no additional benefit is gained with high-intensity anticoagulation. Evidence is lacking to make clear recommendations for the following patients with antiphospholipid antibodies: those without previous thrombosis, those with recurrent thrombosis despite anticoagulation, those undergoing treatment of arterial thrombosis, and women with recurrent fetal loss.

Bottom Line: Patients who test positive for antiphospholipid antibodies are at an increased risk of thrombotic events. Pregnant women who test positive for antiphospholipid antibodies are at an increased risk of fetal loss. Moderate-intensity anticoagulation with warfarin prevents recurrent venous thrombosis. The optimal management of other thrombotic aspects of patients with antiphospholipid antibodies remains uncertain.

Treatment with DOACs

Data from a recent open-label RCT (TRAPS trial) showed that thrombosis, mainly arterial, developed in 12% of triple aPL patients with APS randomised to rivaroxaban compared with none of those randomised to warfarin, over a mean follow-up of 569 days. Based on these results, and the data from a previousand an updated systematic reviewof 447 APS cases treated with DOACs reporting that triple aPL positivity and history of arterial thrombosis was associated with higher risk of recurrent thrombosis, rivaroxaban should not be used in the treatment of patients with APS and arterial thrombosis.

Treatment in patients with recurrent arterial thrombosis despite adequate anticoagulation

No studies were identified that directly addressed the effectiveness and risks related to an increase of INR target to 3–4, or switch of VKA treatment to LMWH. Regarding the addition of LDA, a prospective cohort study with 5-year follow-up showed that among 22 patients with at least one arterial event, new thromboses occurred in 2/4 (50%) treated with VKA and one antiplatelet drug compared with 6/18 (33%) treated with VKA alone. The target INR was > 3 but achieved INR was not reported, and the timing of antiplatelet treatment relative to events was not clearly specified. Confounding by indication may have been present. The role of dual antiplatelet therapy, statins, HCQ and targeted treatments including B-cell depletion therapy for the management of recurrent arterial events has been mainly examined in small case series and may reflect publication bias. Their potential effect in refractory thrombotic APS should be examined in well-designed prospective studies (Research agenda).

Antiphospholipid syndrome after unprovoked venous thrombosis — vitamin K antagonist (VKA) strategy: Recurrence rates without VKA therapy are high, so anticoagulation should be continued lifelong. Higher-intensity warfarin showed no added efficacy over a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2–3; targets of 3 to 4 (versus 2–3) did not add benefit, and high-intensity warfarin was associated with a nonstatistically increased bleeding risk (HR, 2.18 [95% CI, 0.92–5.15]). When compared with aspirin, an INR of 2 to 3 has been shown to be effective.

### How much warfarin is enough in APS related thrombosis? [^112AGUFY]. Thrombosis Research (2004). Low credibility.

Warfarin is the best available, most effective treatment for the secondary prevention of recurrent thrombosis in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) patients. However, warfarin is cumbersome for both patients and physicians because of risk for bleeding and the need for frequent monitoring. Much detail regarding optimal management of APS patients still lacks an evidence-based approach. Asymptomatic patients should not receive warfarin. An optimal treatment for patients with livedo, cardiac valve disease, leg ulcers or microangiopathic nephropathy is unknown; it is likely that warfarin is ineffective for these manifestations of the APS. In low risk patients who have not previously failed warfarin, moderate intensity anticoagulation (target international normalized ratio [INR] 2.5) is as effective as, and safer than, high intensity anticoagulation (INR 3.5), at least for patients with venous thrombosis. Current recommendations, based on the opinion rather than on documentation, state that warfarin should be prescribed for the APS patient's life; studies that challenge this conclusion for carefully defined low risk patients whose thromboses occurred with trigger events will be welcome, as will be studies examining alternatives to warfarin, including antiplatelet drugs.

### Management of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome: a systematic review [^113769uo]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Antiphospholipid antibodies are autoantibodies directed against proteins that bind to phospholipid. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) refers to the association between antiphospholipid antibodies and thrombosis risk or pregnancy morbidity. Patients with APS may be at increased risk of recurrent arterial or venous thrombosis or pregnancy loss.

Objective

To systematically review the evidence for treatment of thrombosis risk in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies or APS.

Evidence Acquisition

Search of MEDLINE (1966 to November 2005) and Cochrane Library electronic databases (2005) and reference lists for randomized trials, meta-analyses of randomized trials, and prospective cohort studies of the treatment of thrombosis risk in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies or APS. Studies were selected on the basis of clinical relevance.

Evidence Synthesis

Among patients with antiphospholipid antibodies, the absolute risk of developing new thrombosis is low (< 1% per year) in otherwise healthy patients without prior thrombotic events, may be moderately increased (up to 10% per year) in women with recurrent fetal loss without prior thrombosis, and is highest (> 10% in the first year) in patients with a history of venous thrombosis who have discontinued anticoagulant drugs within 6 months. Compared with placebo or untreated control, anticoagulation with moderate-intensity warfarin (adjusted to a target international normalized ratio [INR] of 2.0–3.0) reduces the risk of recurrent venous thrombosis by 80% to 90% irrespective of the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies and may be effective for preventing recurrent arterial thrombosis. No evidence exists that high-intensity warfarin (target INR, > 3.0) is more effective than moderate-intensity warfarin. For patients with a single positive antiphospholipid antibody test result and prior stroke, aspirin and moderate-intensity warfarin appear equally effective for preventing recurrent stroke. Treatment issues that have not been addressed in clinical trials, or for which the evidence is conflicting, include the role of antithrombotic prophylaxis in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies without prior thrombosis, the optimal treatment of noncerebrovascular arterial thrombosis, recurrent thrombosis despite warfarin therapy, and treatment of women with antiphospholipid antibodies and recurrent fetal loss.

Conclusions

In patients with APS, moderate-intensity warfarin is effective for preventing recurrent venous thrombosis and perhaps also arterial thrombosis. Aspirin appears to be as effective as moderate-intensity warfarin for preventing recurrent stroke in patients with prior stroke and a single positive test result for antiphospholipid antibody. The optimal treatment of other thrombotic aspects of APS needs to be addressed in well-designed prospective studies.

### What is the appropriate anticoagulation strategy for thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome? [^1117udCQ]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Medium credibility.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune prothrombotic disorder mediated by a heterogeneous group of autoantibodies collectively known as antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). They include lupus anticoagulant (LA), IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and anti-β2-glycoprotein I (anti-β2GPI) antibodies. It has been shown that those patients with all three aPL (triple positive) are at highest risk of both a first thrombotic event and of a recurrence, despite anticoagulation. In response to publication of a meta-analysis and a randomised controlled trial assessing the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban versus warfarin in triple-positive APS with venous and/or arterial thrombosis, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued recommendations that direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOACs) should not be used for secondary prevention of thrombosis in all APS patients (although they did draw specific attention to the high risk of triple-positive patients). As there is less evidence for patients with single- or dual-positive patients with APS, this may be an over-interpretation of the data. In this review, we explore the available evidence on safety and efficacy of DOACs in thrombotic APS, the problem of detecting LA while on DOAC, and provide some practical guidance for managing this problem.

Key Points

- Current APS diagnosis often requires the cessation of anticoagulation therapy in patients who experienced thrombosis.
- An NN, based on TG-derived parameters, diagnoses APS in anticoagulated patients with an accuracy of 92%.

### Therapy with direct oral anticoagulants for secondary prevention of thromboembolic events in the antiphospholipid syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^113tA57G]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

After a comprehensive literature search, this systematic review and meta-analysis summarises all available RCTs for the use of secondary prophylaxis with DOACs versus VKA in patients with APS, including the latest ASTRO-APS Study. We found no clinical value in choosing DOACs over VKA for secondary thrombosis prophylaxis in patients with APS. In fact, DOACs seem to be less effective, especially to those experiencing incident AT. A change from VKA to DOAC does not occur to be beneficial for the patients with APS in terms of risk of bleeding.

However, a subset of patients with APS with only VT history might benefit from DOAC treatment, but this should be addressed by well-designed trials. We suggest the trial outcomes mentioned above as the core outcome set in this area of research and encourage the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Initiative to further define a core domain set for trials in patients with APS.

### EULAR recommendations for the management of antiphospholipid syndrome in adults [^113TKmpJ]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for antiphospholipid syndrome, more specifically with respect to management of recurrent thrombosis, EULAR 2019 guidelines recommend to consider one of the following options in patients with recurrent arterial thrombosis despite adequate treatment with VKA, after evaluating for other potential causes:

- targeting an INR 3–4

- adding low-dose aspirin to current therapy

- switching to LMWH.
