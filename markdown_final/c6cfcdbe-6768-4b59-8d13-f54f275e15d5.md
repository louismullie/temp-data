## Question

Eye burns from u v at high altitude sun exposure symptoms and treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about high-altitude UV eye burns from sun exposure, specifically symptoms and treatment, including pathophysiology, risk factors, symptoms, differential diagnosis, field management, evacuation thresholds, and prevention, with explicit self-verification throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct terminology and pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the altitude-related risk amplification and environmental contributors. Next, I will review the clinical presentation and timing. After that, I need to check the differential diagnoses that mimic UV keratitis. Then, I will examine evidence-based field treatment and what to avoid. I should confirm evacuation criteria and how to triage urgency. Finally, I will synthesize prevention strategies and special considerations for high-altitude travel and refractive surgery patients, anchoring each step to guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the terminology and pathophysiology so I don't mislabel the condition. "High-altitude UV eye burn" is best termed ultraviolet keratitis, also called photokeratitis or snow blindness, which reflects a photochemical corneal epithelial injury from UV-B exposure rather than a true thermal burn, with delayed-onset severe pain due to epithelial cell death and inflammation that typically resolves within 24–48 hours with supportive care [^113uYbi1] [^114qSAuL].

> I need to verify the altitude-related risk amplification and environmental contributors. UV exposure increases by about 4% per 300 meters of ascent, and at 2000 meters on snow, ocular UV exposure can double due to high albedo, with snow reflecting up to 94% of incident UV; wind and low humidity at altitude further desiccate the ocular surface, worsening symptoms and epithelial vulnerability, and UV exposure is not only direct but also substantial from scatter and reflection, especially in the morning and late afternoon when the solar angle favors lateral and oblique rays reaching the cornea and limbus [^116Xa6XM] [^1137k7hn] [^117N4FHW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about timing; I should double-check the latency. Symptoms typically begin 6–12 hours after exposure, with a range of 4–10 hours reported, peaking around 12–24 hours and resolving within 24–48 hours in most cases, though severe presentations can persist several days; this delayed onset often leads patients to miss the causal exposure, so careful history of sun and snow exposure is essential [^113uYbi1] [^116Xa6XM] [^112FwRTY].

> Next, I should review the clinical presentation to ensure I'm not missing atypical features. Patients report severe ocular pain, burning, foreign-body sensation, photophobia, tearing, blepharospasm, and conjunctival injection; fluorescein staining reveals diffuse punctate epithelial erosions across the cornea, and symptoms are typically bilateral, proportional to exposure, and self-limited with supportive therapy [^113uYbi1] [^114qSAuL].

> Wait, let me verify the differential so I don't anchor prematurely. Corneal frostbite can mimic UV keratitis but tends to present immediately after cold wind exposure and may show stromal edema rather than delayed epithelial punctae; corneal abrasion is usually unilateral and traumatic; infectious keratitis evolves with focal infiltrate and purulence; acute angle-closure glaucoma causes halos, nausea, and a mid-dilated, nonreactive pupil; high-altitude retinal hemorrhage is painless with visual field defects or scotomas and warrants descent if macula-involved; solar retinopathy causes central scotoma after direct sun gazing and can leave permanent deficits, so history and exam features are key to distinguish these entities [^1139q6pm] [^112EQ8jW] [^113G1axL] [^111h6svt].

> I will now examine evidence-based field treatment and make sure I don't overstate interventions. Supportive care is the mainstay: frequent preservative-free artificial tears, a short course of topical antibiotic ointment to prevent secondary infection, a cycloplegic such as cyclopentolate or homatropine to reduce ciliary spasm and pain, and systemic NSAIDs for analgesia; patching is not recommended because it does not improve healing and may increase risk, and topical anesthetics should be avoided for repeated use except to facilitate examination or evacuation because they are epitheliotoxic with prolonged exposure [^113uYbi1] [^112Fsidq] [^113ByXnQ] [^1141nCah].

> Hold on, I should verify evacuation criteria and triage so I don't overcall emergencies. Simple UV keratitis without vision loss does not require emergent evacuation; arrange nonemergent evacuation if care is unavailable or if symptoms are severe and unmanageable in the field, whereas any acute vision loss, suspected corneal ulcer, or high-altitude retinal hemorrhage with visual changes warrants emergent evacuation; I initially thought any ocular burn might mandate urgent evacuation, but wait, that applies more to thermal or chemical burns compromising vision rather than uncomplicated UV keratitis, so I should correct that and align with the wilderness triage guidance [^111Mfv9s] [^113uYbi1] [^113G1axL].

> Next, I should review prevention because primary prevention is the most effective "treatment". Sunglasses or goggles must block at least 95–99% of UVA and UVB and have side shields or wraparound design; soft contact lenses with UV-blocking properties can provide additional protection of the cornea and limbus but do not protect periocular skin; brimmed hats reduce indirect and overhead exposure; pretrip planning should include bringing spare prescription eyewear and ensuring those with ocular history consult their ophthalmologist before high-altitude travel [^116Xa6XM] [^113uYbi1] [^11757t6c].

> But wait, what if the patient has a history of refractive surgery or ocular pathology at altitude; I need to ensure I address special risks. After radial keratotomy, altitude-related corneal hypoxia can cause hyperopic shift and blurred vision, so patients should carry multiple strengths of corrective lenses or prescription goggles; LASIK and PRK patients generally have fewer altitude-related refractive changes, though some may experience transient blur, and those with intraocular gas should avoid altitude due to gas expansion risk; corneal hypoxia at altitude can also impair wound healing and surface integrity, increasing susceptibility to UV injury [^1158BzfH] [^116M6UJV].

> Let me reconsider the overall message to ensure internal consistency. High-altitude UV keratitis is a predictable, preventable, and usually self-limited corneal epithelial injury with delayed-onset severe pain; accurate history, careful fluorescein exam, and awareness of mimics guide management; field therapy is supportive with lubrication, infection prophylaxis, cycloplegia, and analgesia, while avoiding patching and chronic topical anesthetics; evacuation is generally nonemergent unless vision is threatened or care is unavailable; and robust UV eye protection with side coverage is the cornerstone of prevention in alpine and snow environments [^113uYbi1] [^116Xa6XM] [^111Mfv9s].

---

High-altitude UV eye burns (photokeratitis) present with **severe pain, photophobia, tearing, foreign-body sensation, and blurred vision** 6–12 hours after exposure, typically resolving within 24–48 hours with supportive care [^113uYbi1] [^116Xa6XM]. Management is supportive: **preservative-free artificial tears, topical antibiotics, and a short-acting cycloplegic** (e.g. cyclopentolate 1%) for pain control; avoid patching and topical anesthetics beyond initial exam [^113uYbi1] [^112Fsidq]. Prevention requires **100% UV-blocking wraparound sunglasses or goggles with side shields**, and a wide-brim hat; soft contact lenses with UV blockers can add protection but do not replace eyewear [^116Xa6XM] [^11757t6c]. Most cases heal without sequelae, but repeated or severe exposures can cause chronic damage; **evacuate if vision loss, corneal opacity, or severe pain persists** beyond 48 hours [^111Mfv9s].

---

## Clinical presentation and symptoms

Photokeratitis typically presents with the following **symptoms**, which usually begin 6–12 hours after UV exposure:

- **Severe ocular pain**: Often described as burning or gritty sensation [^113uYbi1].
- **Photophobia**: Sensitivity to light is common [^115PsiXE].
- **Tearing and conjunctival injection**: Excessive tearing and redness of the eye [^115PsiXE].
- **Foreign body sensation**: Feeling of sand or grit in the eye [^115PsiXE].
- **Blurred vision**: Temporary vision impairment may occur [^112FwRTY].
- **Eyelid edema and blepharospasm**: Swelling of the eyelids and involuntary eyelid closure [^115PsiXE].

Symptoms typically resolve within **24–48 hours** with appropriate management, although severe cases may persist for several days [^114qSAuL] [^116Xa6XM].

---

## Pathophysiology

UV radiation, particularly UV-B, causes direct **damage to corneal epithelial cells**, leading to cell death and inflammation. The cornea absorbs most UV-B radiation, protecting deeper ocular structures; however, high-altitude exposure overwhelms these defenses, causing photokeratitis [^116Xa6XM]. The inflammatory response results in corneal epithelial edema, punctate epithelial erosions, and conjunctival hyperemia [^114qSAuL].

---

## Risk factors

Several factors increase the risk of **UV eye burns** at high altitude:

- **High altitude**: UV radiation increases by approximately 4% for every 300 meters of elevation gain [^116Xa6XM].
- **Snow reflection**: Snow reflects up to 80–90% of UV radiation, significantly increasing ocular exposure [^notfound].
- **Lack of eye protection**: Failure to wear appropriate UV-blocking eyewear significantly increases risk [^112FwRTY].
- **Time of day**: UV exposure is highest between 10 AM and 4 PM.
- **Individual susceptibility**: Light-colored eyes, certain medications (e.g. tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones), and pre-existing ocular surface diseases increase susceptibility [^113W43V7].

---

## Treatment

Treatment of UV eye burns at high altitude focuses on **symptom relief, preventing secondary infection, and promoting corneal healing**:

- **Artificial tears**: Frequent instillation of preservative-free artificial tears to lubricate the ocular surface and reduce discomfort [^113uYbi1].
- **Topical antibiotics**: Prevent secondary bacterial infection; erythromycin ointment or fluoroquinolone drops are recommended [^113uYbi1].
- **Cycloplegic agents**: Short-acting cycloplegics (e.g. cyclopentolate 1%) reduce ciliary spasm and alleviate pain [^113uYbi1].
- **Systemic analgesics**: NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen) provide pain relief and reduce inflammation [^113uYbi1].
- **Cold compresses**: Apply cold compresses to reduce eyelid edema and discomfort.
- **Avoidance of further UV exposure**: Strict avoidance of sunlight until symptoms resolve [^112FwRTY].

Patching is **not recommended**, as it does not improve healing or comfort and may increase the risk of infection [^113ByXnQ].

---

## Prevention

Prevention is critical in high-altitude environments. The following measures are **strongly recommended**:

- **UV-blocking eyewear**: Sunglasses or goggles that block 100% of UV radiation, with side shields or wraparound design [^112Mbdoa].
- **Wide-brimmed hats**: Provide additional protection by reducing indirect UV exposure [^112Mbdoa].
- **Soft contact lenses with UV blockers**: Offer additional protection but do not replace the need for sunglasses [^116Xa6XM].
- **Education**: Inform individuals about the risks of UV exposure and the importance of eye protection [^11757t6c].

---

## Potential complications

Although most cases resolve without sequelae, repeated or severe UV exposure can lead to **chronic complications**, including:

- **Pterygium**: A benign growth of conjunctival tissue over the cornea [^116JDHg6].
- **Cataracts**: UV-induced lens opacification [^111QB6AD].
- **Pinguecula**: Yellowish conjunctival deposits [^116JDHg6].
- **Chronic dry eye**: Persistent ocular surface inflammation [^113dsBWc].

---

## Evacuation criteria

Evacuation from high-altitude environments is **not typically required** for uncomplicated UV keratitis. However, evacuation should be considered if:

- **Severe pain**: Uncontrolled despite treatment.
- **Vision loss**: Persistent or progressive.
- **Corneal opacity**: Development of corneal opacity or ulceration.
- **Failure to improve**: No improvement within 48 hours [^notfound].

---

High-altitude UV eye burns (photokeratitis) are a common and preventable condition characterized by delayed-onset pain, photophobia, and tearing. Management is supportive, focusing on lubrication, infection prevention, and pain control, while prevention relies on **consistent use of UV-blocking eyewear** and education.

Chemical or radiant energy injuries to the eyes are considered ocular burns. The majority of these injuries are occupation-related. Chemical burns are by far more common and represent a true emergency. Thermal and UV injuries are associated with severe pain, but often result in less long-term sequelae than chemical injuries do. The term "biologic exposure" refers to an exposure to human blood or other body fluid. This article describes patterns of these injuries and exposures, with particular emphasis on emergent management and including acute diagnostic and treatment considerations.

Snow blindness — ultraviolet (UV) exposure risks, clinical course, and prevention are detailed: The structures of the eye are vulnerable to damage from exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, with risk increasing at high altitudes (increases 4% per 300 m ascent), and in a snowy environment at 2000 m, UV exposure is doubled. "Snow blindness" results from acute UV ocular injury with symptoms that begin 4 to 10 h after exposure and last < 48 h (or several days if severe). Prevention includes sunglasses or goggles with side protection, which absorb > 95% of all UV light; soft contact lenses that block UV-light and cover the pupil and limbus offer good protection; and brimmed hats for additional shade.

Adequate treatment of eye burns is an essential task of rescue teams. Clinical and occupational medicine studies have shown that efficient emergency treatment can prevent severe eye damage, but therapy is frequently delayed or inadequate. When initial therapy has been delayed or missed, several treatment strategies, including surgery, are available that may improve the outcome of an injury with poor visual prognosis. Discussed in this review are common accident mechanisms, causative agents and biophysical/pathogenetic aspects of eye burns, together with emergency and long-term treatment strategies including surgical procedures, and factors influencing outcome.

Although eyes are not frequently injured in the mountains, they are exposed to many adverse factors from the environment. This article, intended for first responders, paramedics, physicians, and mountaineers, is the consensus opinion of the International Commission for Mountain Emergency Medicine (ICAR-MEDCOM). Its aim is to give practical advice on the management of eye problems in mountainous and remote areas. Snow blindness and minor injuries, such as conjunctival and corneal foreign bodies, could immobilize a person and put him or her at risk of other injuries. Blunt or penetrating trauma can result in the loss of sight in the eye; this may be preventable if the injury is managed properly. In almost all cases of severe eye trauma, protecting the eye and arranging an immediate evacuation are necessary. The most common eye problems, however, are due to ultraviolet light and high altitude. People wearing contact lenses and with previous history of eye diseases are more vulnerable. Any sight-threatening eye problem or unexplained visual loss at high altitude necessitates descent. Wearing appropriate eye protection, such as sunglasses with sidepieces and goggles with polarized or photochromic lenses, could prevent most of the common eye problems in mountaineering.

Introduction

It is inevitable for an ophthalmologist to be consulted for an acute chemical burn. Many of such cases are mild and may be managed easily without remarkable sequelae. On the other hand, some chemical burns are so severe that they require frequent ophthalmic examinations and surgical operations for the management of structural, functional, and cosmetic complications. Despite what seems appropriate and timely management, further damage may ensue and result in severe loss of vision.

Health-related challenges of the implementation team

Amidst the hard-to-work terrains of Keylong and its nearby areas, the study team encountered significant health hurdles primarily attributed to the high altitudes and chilling weather. Notably, prevalent symptoms such as shortness of breath and ultraviolet (UV) exposure persisted throughout our operations. Out of nine drone team members, all experienced shortness of breath (9/9, 100%) even after walking for short distances (online supplemental figure 1). Similarly, all the team members reported sunburns (9/9, 100%), while one member reported eye irritation due to long exposure to direct sunlight. The sleep disturbance was also reported (6/9, 67%), which is characterised by increased awakenings at night during sleep, frequent brief arousals, nocturnal hypoxaemia and periodic breathing. Two team members (2/9, 22%) even reported high altitude sickness and showed symptoms like palpitations, vomiting and nausea. The food-related challenges in the area also escalate the health issues as the supply chain is not well developed due to which the food items availability is limited and the fresh food items are to be imported from outside the district.

### Ultraviolet damage to the eye revisited: eye-sun protection factor (E-SPF ®), a new ultraviolet protection label for eyewear [^1137k7hn]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Ambient UV: direct radiation, scatter, and reflection

Direct sunlight only partly contributes to ambient UV. Under average conditions, more than 50% of ocular exposure results from scattering and cloud reflection. Due to the functional relationship between scattering and wavelength (proportionate to inverse fourth power of wavelength, Rayleigh's law), UVR is scattered to a considerably higher extent than is visible light, and UV-B even more so than UV-A. Even on a clear sunny day, the main proportion of UV-B incident at the face is contributed by diffuse scatter.

Scattering is increased by clouds and haze. Ground reflection of UV (albedo) depends on the surface, with grass reflecting at low rates (2%–5%), open water 3%–13%, concrete about 10%, and snow 94%. UV intensity to the body is most significantly determined by solar angle. Higher altitude as well as lower latitude increase ambient UVR burden.

In general, adults and children are exposed to about 2%–4% of total available annual UV, while adults working outdoors receive about 10%. The average annual UV dose is estimated to be 20,000–30,000 J/m 2 for Americans,10,000–20,000 J/m 2 for Europeans, and 20,000–50,000 J/m 2 for Australians, excluding vacation, which can add 30% or more to the UV dose.

Ocular factors: exposure geometry and anatomic conditions

Recent studies underscore the need for a clear distinction between general UV irradiance and UV incident at the eye. The burden for the skin and that for structures of the eye differ significantly. For geometric and anatomic reasons, exposure of the eye is much more influenced by ground reflection than is the skin. While ambient UVR peaks around noon, UVR reaching the eye depends largely on the solar angle. Depending on the time of year and latitude, ocular UVR can peak in the early morning and afternoon, at a time when the potential for UV damage to the skin or eye is usually considered to be reduced compared with the peak of the day. For summer in Japan, Sasaki et al demonstrated the UV-B burden (at the level of the cornea) between 8 am and 10 am and between 2 pm and 4 pm to be nearly twice as high as that at noon, even though the total amount of ambient UVR is low in the morning (Figure 3).

Ocular and periocular barotrauma in diving — prevention and evacuation: When air in a closed space is exposed to higher atmospheres of pressure it is compressed, and while diving with a facemask the lids, skin, and eyes can be drawn out into the mask, causing periorbital ecchymosis, edema, subconjunctival hemorrhage, and potentially hyphema; prevention can be achieved by frequently filling one's mask with exhaled air from the nose to increase the volume of air in the mask. If hyphema is present, evacuation should be emergent; mask pressure equalization is graded Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence and hyphema evacuation is graded Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.

### An update on chemical eye burns [^111oQHL7]. Eye (2019). Medium credibility.

Ocular chemical injuries vary in severity, with the more severe end of the spectrum having profound visual consequences and medicolegal implications. Grading of ocular injuries is critical for determining acute treatment and visual prognosis. Poor immediate management results in more challenging treatment of acute disease. Similarly, poorly controlled acute disease results in more treatment-resistant chronic ocular disease. Despite several decades of research and public health initiatives, simple and effective interventions such as wearing protective eyewear and immediate irrigation of eyes remain as key challenges. Education and prevention are therefore important public health messages. Hurdles in the acute management of disease include poor evidence-base for commonly used treatments (e.g. based on experimental animal studies), reduced treatment adherence rates and high clinic non-attendance rates. The evolution of treatment strategies, particularly limbal stem cell transplantation, has revolutionised the visual and cosmetic outcomes in chronic phases of disease. It is therefore increasingly important to consider tertiary referral for patients with limbal stem cell failure or vision-limiting corneal scarring.

High-altitude retinal hemorrhage is described as resulting from increased retinal blood flow and retinal vein dilation leading to retinal hemorrhages that have been well described since the 1970s; the percentage of climbers experiencing retinal hemorrhages ranges from 4% to 82%, and most cases do not cause visual disturbances unless the macula is involved. Patients can continue ascending if no visual disturbances are present but should be instructed to descend in the setting of altered vision, and high altitude retinal hemorrhage has been associated with acute mountain sickness and should alert providers to possible high altitude pulmonary edema or high altitude cerebral edema; Descent if visual changes: 1C.

Treatment in the wilderness is often based on available supplies and treatments rather than on the most evidence-based interventions, and with proper planning, tools, and physical examination skills, most providers can determine the need for further intervention or evacuation in cases of ocular pathology in the wilderness.

### Ultraviolet keratitis among mountaineers and outdoor recreationalists [^112FwRTY]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Ultraviolet (UV) keratitis is a self-limited, inflammatory condition resulting in pain and temporary visual disturbance following acute UV radiation exposure. It may afflict mountaineers and other outdoor recreationalists because snow, water, and sand reflect a high percentage of UV radiation reaching the earth's surface. We examined the cases of UV keratitis that have occurred on National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS) courses in order to better understand its epidemiology and to help prevent this affliction on wilderness expeditions.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed all cases of UV keratitis that occurred on NOLS courses from 1984–2009. Subject demographics and contributing factors were recorded and descriptive information reported.

Results

Fifteen cases of UV keratitis occurred during the study period with an overall incidence of 0.06% in those exposed. All cases occurred in mountainous or snowy terrain except one case which occurred while boating on a river. Thirteen of the 15 (87%) cases occurred in participants who were not wearing sunglasses. Two cases (13%) occurred in participants who were wearing sunglasses without side shields. Ten cases (71%) occurred in sunny conditions, and 4 cases (29%) occurred in cloudy or low visibility conditions. In all cases, symptoms resolved within 36 hours after cessation of UV exposure.

Conclusion

Appropriate eye protection, including adequate lenses with appropriate side shields, should be worn in mountain or water environments in order to prevent UV keratitis. This data supports the conventional conception of UV keratitis as a relatively mild and self-limited condition, if treated appropriately.

The ocular surface of the eye

Ocular surface diseases (OSDs) encompass a range of pathologies involving the structures and tissues dedicated to the interface between the environment and the highly sensitive external ocular tissues. These protective tissues are of paramount importance, and sight-threatening manifestations may occur in case of loss of both local and extraocular homeostasis and impaired protection sensors (figure 3).

Figure 3
Ocular surface diseases encompass a range of pathologies involving the structures and tissues.

Adverse environments play a major role in inducing or aggravating dry eye symptoms and OSDs. Dry, windy or dirty environments, air conditioning, blue light and ultraviolet (UV) exposures, pollution, and high altitude, may cause various effects on the ocular surface through oxidative stress, inflammatory, allergic or toxic mechanisms. Video display terminals play a particular role in associating adverse environments, blue light exposure, ocular fatigue and reduced blinking rate. Other interventions such as chronic use of eye-drops, especially if containing preservatives, contact lens wear or refractive surgery are important risk factors of OSD.

Dry eye disease (DED) concerns up to 15% of the general population and approximately 50% of people working or gaming in front of a VDT, which potentially concerns all electronic sports (Esports) athletes to a level that is still not fully recognised (see paragraph on Esports).

The main consequence of DED is a significant decrease in quality of life (QoL). The symptoms of dry eye, such as sensations of discomfort, foreign body, burning, fluctuating visual disturbances, or tearing, initially intermittent, can become permanent and deeply alter the patient's QoL and performance.DED has thus been shown to impact the QoL at levels comparable to angina pectoris grade III/IV.

Studies on large cohorts of patients have shown that dry eye significantly negatively impacts many daily activities, such as reading, using a computer, watching television or driving day or night. Beyond this impairment of QoL, dry eye is associated with psychological disorders such as anxiety and depression.

### Retinal changes following rapid ascent to a high-altitude environment [^115EERPs]. Eye (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tibet, with an average altitude above 4000 m, is often referred to as the 'roof of the world'. As a consequence of its high altitude, environmental factors such as low atmospheric oxygen, low humidity, strong ultraviolet radiation, and low temperatures are prevalent. Given the current political climate surrounding Tibet and neighboring China, it is possible for members of the Chinese military to be assigned to the Tibetan plateau at short notice. However, when military personnel ascend to the Tibetan plateau, they are likely to suffer from a range of symptoms prompted by acute oxygen deficiency, of which ocular disorders are common. The incidence of high-altitude oculopathy can be dependent or independent of other altitude-induced disorders and it is therefore imperative to study the epidemiological and pathogenic basis of these ocular manifestations to understand, and ultimately to prevent their occurrence. As there are few studies describing acute high-altitude oculopathy and its long-term prognosis, this study aimed to describe the effects on the retina from rapidly entering a high-altitude environment and returning to baseline altitude.

Current attempts at eye protection

Populations at risk

Sasaki et al suggest that UV protection of the eye should be provided full time throughout the day and year, given that the UV ocular burden might be higher than supposed by solar irradiation.

Since there is a cumulative burden throughout life, UVR generally poses risks, but there are populations of special concern. In children, increased UV transmission to the retina has been shown since the lens is still clear and the pupil is wider than that in adults. This UV exposure can contribute to retinal stress with delayed consequences, ie, formation of lipofuscin, which might be a contributory factor in age-related macular degeneration.

High ocular UV exposure is seen at higher altitudes, frequent outdoor work, and ample leisure time exposure. Individual factors, such as a thin cornea, larger pupil size, lid and orbital anatomy, hyperopia, aphakia (in the absence of a UV-filtering intraocular lens), and genetic predisposition play a role. Photosensitizing drugs, such as psoralens, phenothiazines, hydrochlorothiazide, porphyrins, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antiarrhythmics (cordarone/amiodarone), tetracyclines, chloroquine, and St John's wort, increase the susceptibility to UVR damage.

Some contact lenses have been shown to reduce UVR markedly, although this differs between brands.–Soft contact lenses have sufficient diameter (typically around 14 mm) to protect the limbal cells, but do not offer protection for the periorbital skin and lids.

Sunglasses reduce transmission, but may increase back reflection. Clear lenses also reduce transmission, but a universal scale to address their protective potential has been lacking. The European Council of Optometry and Optics states:

"The ideal UVR-blocker should transmit only visible radiation and block solar UVR incident on the eye from all directions".

Pretrip planning and prevention — People with a history of any ophthalmologic problems who are participating in wilderness activities should have a complete eye examination within 3 months of any extended trip. Participants should be encouraged to bring all of their own equipment and medications, including glasses, goggles, sunglasses, contacts, lens solution, and any specific medications that they are currently taking or anticipate requiring, and they should bring a copy of their lens prescription or bring extra glasses or contacts if they will be in austere settings. Prevention of eye illness and injuries is paramount, and adequate sun and protective eye wear, good hygiene, and proper hand washing can prevent a large number of the conditions addressed in these guidelines.

The hallmark of allergic conjunctivitis is itching; bacterial conjunctivitis gives a purulent discharge whereas viral conjunctivitis tends to give a watery discharge. Treatment of allergic and viral conjunctivitis is primarily supportive, and bacterial conjunctivitis is treated with antibiotics.

### Management strategies of ocular chemical burns: current perspectives [^1112zuFK]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Management Strategies

Appropriate management of ocular chemical burn requires caring for epithelial defects, inflammatory response, and complications through steps that promote epithelialization, reduce inflammation, and prevent complications. This will break a vicious cycle that each of these factors, if left untreated, may bring about, and thus, may adversely affect outcomes (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Management strategies of ocular chemical burns have three facets: promotion of epithelialization, reduction of inflammation, and prevention of complications.

An ophthalmologist taking care of ocular chemical burns must be familiar with both medical and surgical management of complications. While lower grades may demonstrate continued healing with an excellent prognosis, higher grades may deteriorate rapidly and require surgical interventions at earlier stages. Table 3 provides stage-specific treatment options in ocular chemical burns.

### The ocular frostbite involving cornea caused by low-temperature environment [^1139q6pm]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Previous similar cases have been reported, including a marathon runner who developed eye injury under conditions of high wind speeds and near-zero temperatures. This runner similarly wore no eye protection during prolonged running, had no significant medical history, and developed similar symptoms immediately after running. The reporting doctors also suggested that wind speed might have exacerbated the cold damage to the cornea. Unfortunately, since the reporting physicians were not ophthalmologists, the ocular assessment of this patient was relatively simple, providing only one external photograph with no detailed treatment records. However, we can still observe obvious corneal edema in the central-inferior region of the runner's left eye in the photograph. This type of corneal damage occurring immediately after prolonged exposure to low-temperature, high-wind environments should be distinguished from diffuse corneal epithelial punctate staining that appears several hours after snow environment exposure. From our perspective, the latter condition is more Likely snow blindness, which is corneal epithelial damage caused by ultraviolet Light reflected from snow. Snow blindness typically does not involve the corneal stroma and endothelium, with good prognosis and rapid recovery within 48 h. We believe that low temperature is likely not the primary causative factor in the latter type of patients.

Besides, the treatment administered in this case offers valuable insights. The initial management by local ophthalmologists included topical 50% glucose and Vitamin C. Hyperosmolar eye drops are known to reduce corneal edema, and topical Vitamin C has been reported to aid corneal wound healing. These may explain the treatment choice. However, corneal edema persisted in the right eye and seemingly responded better to topical steroids at our institution. We speculate that steroid therapy may be more effective in patients with corneal frostbite and significant edema.

This case report has limitations. Without pre-frostbite ocular images, we cannot completely exclude a pre-existing endothelial scar. While this case report was limited by the unavailability of corneal confocal microscopy and some imaging resolution constraints due to geographical factors, it provides a rare documentation of environmental cold-induced corneal injury. The findings contribute valuable insights to the clinical management and research understanding of corneal frostbite.

Dosimetry and quantification

Assessing potential UVR hazard quantitatively is a complex task, and even the physical assessment of UV burden incident at the eye remains challenging.

UV burden without lenses

The solar ultraviolet index was developed by the World Health Organization and other organizations to offer an international standard index for UV burden. It is calculated from direct measurement of UV spectral power under standardized conditions to assess the risk of UV damage to the skin.

Studies by Sasaki et al showed that this index is an invalid indicator to determine the need for eye protection and can even be seriously misleading. They performed objective measurements with mannequin heads at defined conditions with regard to a variety of influencing factors, such as altitude, latitude, solar angle, reflectance of airborne particles, reflectance of ground and surroundings, anatomic features, posture, and facing to or away from the sun.UV burden was assessed by UV-B sensors mounted onto the eye sockets of the mannequin heads as well as at the top of the head to compare eye exposure with overall exposure.

UV incident at the ocular surface has been measured by contact lens UV dosimetry to determine the ratio of ocular-to-ambient UV exposure, and was reported to range from 4% to 23% at solar noon.

Walsh et al employed a photodiode sensor array detector located on the surface of the cornea to measure the spectrum of radiation refracted across the cornea. Thus, the Coroneo effect could be demonstrated in vivo, and Kwok et al contributed further evidence by using UV sensors to determine the intensity of peripheral light-focusing that is focused on the nasal limbus versus the angle of incidence for incoming temporal light. The maximum intensity occurred at around an angle of 120° from the sagittal plane.

Measurements have been predominantly performed for UV-B radiation,–due to its higher spectral function efficiency. Since the damage potential of shorter wavelengths is higher, these gain more importance even if the total ratio within the incident UV spectrum is small. Chaney et alprovided a re-evaluation of the UV hazard function, ie, S(λ). This establishes a photobiologic action spectrum that describes the relative effectiveness of different wavelengths in causing a photobiologic effect (relative effectiveness of different wavelengths to elicit a biologic response). This function has been used for 30 years in the ophthalmic industry and in standards and norms for transmission. Dosimetric concepts are explained in more detail in a paper by Sliney.

High altitude — refractive surgery (RK, LASIK, PRK) and eyewear planning notes that radial keratotomy corneas can flatten at altitude causing increased far‑sightedness and a significant decrease in visual acuity; it is recommended that patients who have had RK have various levels of correction available during their excursion, with options including glasses under goggles, several levels of corrective or prescription goggles, and consultation with an ophthalmologist. Eyes with LASIK and PRK undergo fewer refractive changes at altitude, with 2 studies demonstrating blurring of vision at altitude and 2 demonstrating no change; a study of 12 climbers with LASIK‑treated eyes noted no visual changes with changing altitude, and a single PRK study demonstrated no significant change in vision at altitude. Practice statements are: Caution at high altitude if history of RK: 1C; Safety of LASIK/PRK at altitude: 1C; Extra goggles/glasses if history of RK: 1C.

UV exposure to the eye is also determined by geometric factors related to the orbital anatomy and by natural protective mechanisms, including squinting and pupil constriction. The geometric features of the face explain the increasing exposure of UV in the morning related to solar altitude. At higher solar angles, the upper orbital rim and the brow area cast a shadow on the eye. Medially, the eye is protected by the nose; temporally, direct and reflected radiation has wide access. Even when facing away from the sun, the eye is exposed to reflected UVR.

By squinting, ocular exposure is reduced. The "aperture" of the eye is further determined by facial characteristics (eyelids, brow ridge, cheeks). Eyelids and pupil size react to the overall luminance. Pupil size affects lenticular and retinal UV exposure, which depends on multiple factors, such as age and ambient illumination. At the age of 20–29 years, mean dark-adapted pupil diameter has been shown to be 7.33 ± 0.81 mm (2 minutes at 1 lux with preadaptation), with progressive reduction over the decades to 4.85 ± 0.54 mm at the age of 80–89 years.

Interestingly, behind sunglasses, the pupil does not dilate more, as a comprehensive analysis of geometric and radiometric aspects of ocular irradiation showed in an analysis of 400 retail sunglasses.

Another eye-specific effect (as opposed to the skin burden) is the focusing effect of the cornea, especially a peripheral light-focusing effect as described by Coroneo.UVR incident from the periphery is refracted into the eye, and due to the focusing effect of the cornea, UV radiation is on average 22-fold stronger at the nasal limbus, which is the typical site for pterygium and pinguecula. Moreover, UV radiation is on average eight times stronger at the nasal lens cortex, the typical site for cortical cataract. These well known "sun terraces" according to anatomic features are also described by dermatologists. They translate into a higher incidence of malignancies and accelerated aging in areas that are exposed to UVR.

Ophthalmic and otic anesthetic solutions — composition, cross-use, cautions, evidence, and directive: Ophthalmic and otic solutions are generally similar in composition, with ophthalmic solutions sterile and free of particulate matter so they may be instilled in the ear, but otic solutions should not be used in the eye; lacking alternatives, an aqueous solution of lidocaine used for local infiltration can be used in topical ocular application. Ophthalmic solutions can be useful in patients debilitated by corneal abrasion or keratitis to facilitate eye opening and evacuation, and a meta-analysis pooling two randomized, prospective emergency department studies showed no clinically significant adverse effects with repeated use of ophthalmic proparacaine for less than 72 h; accordingly, a short course may aid evacuation, while care should be taken to protect an anesthetized eye from dryness, foreign bodies, or UV radiation. Recommendation: We suggest that ophthalmic anesthetic solutions are, when used appropriately, safe and useful for the treatment of acute ocular and auricular pain in austere environments (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).

Abstract

Ocular chemical burns are absolute ophthalmic emergencies and require immediate management to minimize devastating sequelae. Management of alkali and acid burns is started at the scene of the accident by copious irrigation. Treatment is directed at improving epithelial integrity and stromal stability, reduction of undue inflammation, and prevention or timely management of complications. To ascertain the best possible outcome, numerous biological medications and surgical interventions have been merged into conventional therapeutic regimens. These include autologous and umbilical cord serum preparations, platelet-rich plasma, amniotic membrane transplantation, limbal stem-cell transplantation, and anti-angiogenic agents.

UV hazard to structures of the eye

Animal models cannot be translated directly into a similar risk in humans, since characteristics of animal and human eyes differ, for example, in lens characteristics or in UV absorption potential of the cornea, with the rodent cornea absorbing UV only below 300 nm. Despite their limitations, animal studies and human epidemiologic studies pointing in the same direction build a strong basis for sufficiently reliable correlations. Table 2 shows correlations that have been agreed upon in numerous studies, even for UVR alone. Chromophores are abundantly present in DNA, thus rendering it sensitive to mutagenesis. One role of UVR is attributed to damaging germinal epithelial cells such as corneal or lens cells by interference with DNA.

Acute UV-induced damage

Acute UVR at sufficiently high doses induces acute photokeratitis, welder's flash, or arc eye. Photokeratitis following short wave UVR is easy to demonstrate, for example, by comparison with eyes protected by UV blocking contact lenses. Photokeratitis induced by irradiation with 180–400 nm UVR is a temporary photochemical injury to corneal cells. It presents with ocular pain several hours after acute exposure, with symptoms lasting for 24–48 hours. Laboratory studies have shown damage to keratinocytes and epithelial cells of the cornea, with strong healing properties. Acute responses to above-threshold doses are epithelial cell death and related conjunctival trauma. In rare cases, higher energy exposure can lead to permanent endothelial cell damage. The subclinical photokeratitis level is approximately 30–40 J/m 2 normalized to the UV hazard (photokeratitis) action spectrum peak of 270 nm (as defined by American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists and International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection and stated in EU Directive 2006/25/EC). The radiant exposure at 300 nm that would be equivalent to the corneal exposure of 30–40 J/m 2 at 270 nm is 100 J/m 2. UVR exposure can also induce photoconjunctivitis (irritation, swelling, redness, pruritus), and eyelid sunburn.

Chronic UV-induced damage

On an individual and epidemiologic basis, chronic UV exposure is of much higher relevance than is acute UV-induced damage. Several eye diseases have been attributed to UVR, mainly based on epidemiologic and animal studies.–

### Retinal changes following rapid ascent to a high-altitude environment [^1137UxSn]. Eye (2018). Low credibility.

In a study by Yi, patients treated in an ophthalmology clinic over 8 years in Tibet were observed for symptoms of high-altitude oculopathy, with many of them diagnosed with bulbar conjunctival vascular dilatation, pterygium, cataract, visual dysfunction, and high intraocular pressure. Zhanganalyzed 48 adults with a visual acuity < 0.5 logMAR who had migrated to Tibet and found that in 10 of them, their decreased vision was caused by cataracts probably induced by chronic hypoxia and long-term ultraviolet radiation, and other reasons included retinal hemorrhage and maculopathy. Furthermore, Wang et al has reported a clinical case of sharply decreased vision caused by plateau hypoxia, indicating that people without acclimatization have a higher incidence and severity of high-altitude oculopathy. Therefore, it is important to understand the prevalence of high-altitude oculopathy and to ultimately use this information to aid in the prevention and treatment of this condition. Currently, the majority of studies start observing changes inside the eye using modern advanced instrumentation instead of only investigating the surface of the eye. Fischer et al adopted OCT and microdetermination to quantify changes in central retinal structure and function of 14 healthy subjects during rapid ascent to a high-altitude area (4559 m), and results found an increase of total retinal thickness. Ascaso et al employed OCT to conduct complete ophthalmologic examinations for 12 healthy male mountaineers after four high-altitude expeditions in the Himalayas, and results indicated that average peripapillary RNFL thickness as well as the RNFL thickness of superior and temporal quadrants got a notable increase and that VIRA was much higher than that at baseline altitude. In this study, OCT was also used to determine the fine structure of retina such as thickness of the RNFL and GCL in the macula and the RNFL in the optic disc.

Discussion

In a high-altitude environment, factors such as low atmospheric oxygen, low humidity, and strong ultraviolet radiation can induce a series of pathophysiologic phenomena that can result in disorders of the cardiovascular, respiratory, and ocular systems. The first report of this ocular phenomenon was published in 1968, where Singh et al observed one case of a papilledema, retinal vein dilation, and retinal hemorrhage and three cases of vitreous hemorrhage in individuals who had ascended to a high altitude for a short period of time. In 1970, Frayser et al reported nine cases of retinal hemorrhage and tortuositas vasorum retinae, including one case with acute headache and choked disc, in individuals who had ascended to high altitude. As a consequence of these reports, Chinese researchers became concerned with the health of communities living in the high-altitude regions of areas like Tibet and Qinghai and subsequently undertook their own studies over the following decades.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for treatment of eye injuries and illnesses in the wilderness: 2024 update [^112EQ8jW]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Corneal ulcers — recognition and initial wilderness management prioritize emergent care, culture when near expert evaluation, and empiric fluoroquinolone therapy when far from care, with explicit dosing instructions and evacuation. Signs include significant pain, white or gray corneal infiltrate, and an epithelial defect on fluorescein exam; emergent treatment is important, and contact lenses must be discontinued. If the patient is within 1–3 h of an ophthalmologist's evaluation, we recommend the ophthalmologist obtain a culture before initiating treatment; if more than a few hours from expert evaluation, we recommend beginning empiric antibiotic treatment with fourth-generation fluoroquinolone eye drops, such as moxifloxacin 0.5%, loading by instilling 1 drop every 5 min for the first 30 min, then 1 drop every 30 min for 6 h, followed by 1 drop every hour until seen. Oral fluoroquinolones are warranted if nothing else is available (such as moxifloxacin, 400 mg daily for 7 days), and cycloplegic medication (such as atropine 1%, 1 drop every 8 h) can be given; evacuation should be emergent. Recommendation grades include: Antibiotics, topical — Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence; Antibiotics, systemic — Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence; Cycloplegic — Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence; Evacuation — Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guideline on care of burns in the wilderness [^114ErTe1]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Evacuation criteria for burn patients — The Wilderness Medical Society wound management guidelines cite Level 1C evidence for evacuation of patients with burns requiring higher levels of care, including airway or inhalational injury; burns to the thorax that impair ventilation; significant burns to hands, feet, genitals, mucous membranes, or face; circumferential partial- or full-thickness burns; full-thickness burns of > 5% TBSA; partial-thickness burns of > 10 to 20% TBSA; infected burns; burns with uncontrolled pain; lightning injuries; electrical burns; and chemical burns. Additionally, we suggest evacuation be expedited if there are burns to the eye that compromise vision; any burn that required advanced airway management in the field; any burn that requires field escharotomy or fasciotomy; signs of impending compartment syndrome; burns associated with significant trauma; other signs of decreased perfusion; burns with associated hypothermia; deep partial- or full-thickness burns of > 5% TBSA; superficial partial-thickness burns of > 10 to 20% TBSA; partial- or full-thickness burns over joints; burns of > 5% TBSA in infants (< 2 y); burns with suspicion of carbon monoxide or cyanide toxicity; and burns that impair the victim's ability to remain active in the field. This means that most burn patients will require evacuation, with only minor burns being appropriate for a trial of field management.

### Ultraviolet damage to the eye revisited: eye-sun protection factor (E-SPF ®), a new ultraviolet protection label for eyewear [^111cbJHG]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Cornea: pterygium, pinguecula, climatic droplet keratopathy

The cornea is most exposed to UVR, absorbing the greatest part, not only from direct irradiation but also from oblique rays arriving at an angle of up to 110°, which are then reflected across the cornea and anterior chamber into the limbal area. Absorbing UVR puts these structures at risk. In climatic droplet keratopathy, translucent material characteristically accumulates in the corneal stroma, most prominently in the band between the lids. The incidence is greater in regions high in UVR and in persons who spend considerable time outdoors; this is attributed to UV exposure inducing denaturation of plasma proteins.

Outdoor work is a recognized factor for development of pterygium.–Pterygium was found to be almost twice as frequent among persons who work outdoors, but only one fifth as likely among those who always use sunglasses outdoors. In areas with higher ambient UV burden (close to the equator, higher altitude), and in regions with higher ground reflectivity, prevalence is higher.–

The more common site for pterygium is the nasal conjunctiva. Coroneo explained this (as well as the advent of typical cataract "spokes" in the nasal quadrant of the lens) by incident oblique rays arriving at the peripheral cornea that are focused at this very predilective site.

UV-B radiation induces oxidative stress in corneal epithelial cells, and upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines has been shown. In a first step, pinguecula develop, followed later by pterygia which can reduce vision and often necessitate surgery.

Dry eye disease

Tears absorb incident UV and contain antioxidants. With decreasing tear film production in older individuals, a reduced antioxidant supply as well as UV-absorbing properties could predispose to more severe UV corneal damage.

UV exposure to the eye

UV definition

The electromagnetic spectrum ranges from infrared to visible light (Figure 1), and extends down to the shortest gamma rays. Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is invisible to human perception. The ozone layer absorbs shorter wavelengths more efficiently, therefore the longer range of UV radiation, ie, UV-A (400–320 nm), contributes up to 95% of total UVR. Approximately 5% is contributed by UV-B (320–280 nm, middle UV).UV-C (280–220 nm) is absorbed within the atmosphere, mainly in the ozone layer. In recent decades, exposure to UV-A and UV-B radiation has become more relevant in areas with a deficient ozone layer. The composition of UV-A/UV-B (Figure 1) depends on the height of the sun above the horizon, on haze and cloud cover, and on atmospheric pollution.

With decreasing wavelength, spectral energy increases, and higher spectral energy raises the potential for ocular damage,(Figure 2). At 300 nm (UV-B), the biologic damage potential surmounts the damage potential at 325 nm by a factor 600×. For ophthalmic standards, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 8980/3 norm defines a cutoff at 380 nm for UV-A (380–320 nm, near UV). From the danger potential point of view, experts, ie, ophthalmologists, cell biologists, and photochemists, agreed to include the range between 380 nm and 400 nm, the cutoff of 400 nm for UVR being adopted by the World Health Organization, European Council of Optometry and Optics, Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage, and others. The division of the UV spectrum into the spectral regions was defined in 1932 as UV-A at 400–315 nm, UV-B at 315–280 nm, and UV-C at 280–100 nm, while environmental photobiologists and dermatologists frequently define the regions as UV-A at 400–320 nm, UV-B at 320–290 nm, and UV-C at 290–200 nm.

UV sources

The predominant source of UVR is natural sunlight. Artificial light sources contribute to a lesser extent, but might become more important with the advent of modern and more energy-efficient light sources. In specific settings (eg, welding, microscopes, sun beds without adequate protection), the UV burden is increased.

### Antarctica eye study: a prospective study of the effects of overwintering on ocular parameters and visual function [^113YszKX]. BMC Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In 2013 five polar explorers attempted a Trans-Antarctic Winter Traverse (TAWT). Good visual function is critical for effective and safe activity in extreme environmental conditions such as those found on the Antarctic Plateau. Furthermore, any damage to visual function may have implications for future expeditions, to those who regularly overwinter in the polar regions, and to those who experience prolonged exposure to the extreme cold and chronic hypoxia.

To date, the majority of outdoor and expedition research has focused on mountain climbers reaching high altitude. These are generally higher than the Antarctic Plateau, which was reached during the TAWT, however the duration at altitude tends to be much shorter for mountain climbers. Such studies of mountaineers operating in cold and high altitude environments have shown moderate reversible changes in visual function and ocular parameters due to hypoxia: intraocular pressure rises slightly, central corneal thickness can increase, retinal blood flow may change, and marked hyperopic shifts have also been noted, particularly in the presence of previous radial keratotomy. Moreover, at very high altitudes, a characteristic haemorrhagic retinopathy can develop.

In the early twentieth century during the heroic age of Antarctic exploration, polar explorers reportedly commonly suffered from ultraviolet (UV) keratitis (snow blindness) and the medical supplies taken on polar expeditions included ophthalmic preparations accordingly. Scant further studies have reported effects due to the prolonged UV radiation exposure including the development of UV keratitis, maculodystrophy, corneal dystrophy and accelerated cataract formation. A single study involving 24 Ukrainian Antarctic expedition personnel between 2011 and 2013 found specific changes including parenchymatous-endothelial keratopathy, nuclear-posteriorcapsular phacopathy and maculopathy, with morphological signs of acute solar retinopathy present in more than 50% winterers. The TAWT afforded a new opportunity to study the effects of the winter in more detail, offering a different sort of environmental challenge, where UV exposure during the winter months is minimal. More recently telemedicine has been used to help diagnose ophthalmic conditions however, there is limited ophthalmic diagnostic equipment available in the health and medical clinics in Antarctic bases.

### New insights into changes in ocular structural parameters in simulated hypobaric hypoxia [^112SUgCc]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

There are numerous distinctions between high-altitude and sea-level environments, which are typified by low oxygen concentrations, low temperatures and high UV radiation. A number of studies have demonstrated that the ocular data of individuals residing at high altitude for an extended period, such as in the Tibetan Plateau, exhibit notable differences in ocular characteristics, including nose bridge width, inner and outer intercanthal distance and interpupillary distance. Additionally, alterations in the internal eye have been observed, including a reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP), a shorter AL of the eye and a high prevalence of lens cloudiness. However, the aforementioned evidence is inconsistent with the results of this study, as the mean AL of the subjects' eyes increased with altitude, reached a maximum at the highest altitude and then gradually recovered after returning to the ground. This suggests that acute hypoxia causes reversible changes in the AL of the eyes, and it was considered to be potentially associated with choroidal blood supply.

Physiological relevance

The lens is particularly susceptible to damage from UV radiation reflected off surfaces like water, sand, and snow. While UVB is mostly absorbed by the cornea and lens, UVA and visible BL can reach the retina.

Chronic exposure to HEV light has been implicated in oxidative stress, photoreceptor damage, and retinal pigment epithelium dysfunction. This is particularly relevant for individuals with minimal ocular protection and in areas with prolonged exposure in high UV-index zones.

### Ultraviolet damage to the eye revisited: eye-sun protection factor (E-SPF ®), a new ultraviolet protection label for eyewear [^1163PpXx]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Future tasks and research agenda

Research should not only quantify the benefit of UV eye protection but also address the question of whether UV incident at the eye might initiate positive effects that should be maintained. For the skin, UVR plays an important role for vitamin D synthesis and in regulating important aspects of the immune system.

Vitamin D synthesis is not likely to be affected by protecting the eye against UVR, but the interaction between UVR and the immune system of the eye is unclear. The immune system of the eye has specific properties, ie, the eye is "immune-privileged". Whether UVR plays a detrimental or protective role on the immune system of the eye is still unknown. A recent study showed upregulation expression of inflammatory and anti-oxydant mediators in corneal epithelial cells. However, at present, there is no evidence for beneficial effects of UVR on eye tissues comparable with the beneficial effects of UV irradiating skin.

### CDC grand rounds: prevention and control of skin cancer [^115ctFnF]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States, and most cases are preventable. Persons with certain genetic risk factors, including having a lighter natural skin color; blue or green eyes; red or blonde hair; dysplastic nevi or a large number of common moles; and skin that burns, freckles, or reddens easily or becomes painful after time in the sun, have increased risk for skin cancer. Persons with a family or personal history of skin cancer, especially melanoma, are also at increased risk. Although these genetic factors contribute to individual risk, most skin cancers are also strongly associated with ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure. Most UV exposure comes from the sun, although some persons use UV-emitting indoor tanning devices (e.g., beds, booths, and lamps).

### Work-related eye injuries and illnesses [^1119owfA]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

More than 65,000 work-related eye injuries and illnesses, causing significant morbidity and disability, are reported in the United States annually. A well-equipped eye tray includes fluorescein dye, materials for irrigation and foreign body removal, a short-acting mydriatic agent, and topical anesthetics and antibiotics. The tray should be prepared in advance in case of an eye injury. Eye patching does not improve cornea reepithelialization or discomfort from corneal abrasions. Blunt trauma to the eye from a heavy object can cause a blow-out fracture. Sudden eye pain after working with a chisel, hammer, grinding wheel, or saw suggests a penetrating globe injury. Chemical eye burns require immediate copious irrigation. Nontraumatic causes of ocular illness are underreported; work-related allergic conjunctivitis increasingly has been recognized among food handlers and agriculture workers who are exposed to common spices, fruits, and vegetables. The patient's history of eye injury guides the diagnosis. Primary prevention and patient counseling on proper eye protection is essential because over 90 percent of injuries can be avoided with the use of eye protection. As laser use increases in industry and medical settings, adequate personal protection is needed to prevent cataracts. Outdoor workers exposed to significant ultraviolet rays need sun protection and safety counseling to prevent age-related macular degeneration. Contact lenses do not provide eye protection, and physicians should be familiar with guidelines for the use of contacts in the workplace.

### Corneal thermal burn injuries during long-duration spaceflight: mechanisms, evaluation, and management [^117LYAxE]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Risk Factors for Corneal Thermal Burns During Spaceflight

Examining the equipment used on the ISS reveals potential hazards and exposures to corneal thermal burns. Tools like the space oven for meal preparation highlight sources of heat the crewmembers interact with daily during their missions. The Zero G Kitchen Space Oven utilizes electrical heating elements to heat food to a nominal temperature of 177 degrees Celsius (350 degrees Fahrenheit). Although there is a cooling rack, and the space oven is thoroughly tested before integration into the ISS, technical malfunctions or exposure to hot food particles may induce a corneal burn. Moreover, the limited and confined nature of the spacecraft amplifies the risk of thermal burns, as the proximity of equipment and limited spatial freedom heightens the likelihood of accidental exposure to sources of heat. Crewmembers are also notably susceptible to radiant energy burns (aka flash burns) from direct or reflective UV light from the sun.

During a Apollo-Soyuz test project in 1975, propellant and combustion products (e.g. hydrazine, nitrogen oxide, nitrogen tetroxide) were inadvertently admitted into the cabin during re-entry. In a hypothetical scenario with similar conditions aboard the ISS, the propellants could combine with other reagents to create an exothermic reaction and a potential burn risk to crewmembers. Scientific experiments with flames or exothermic chemical reactions may put crewmembers at increased risk of obtaining corneal thermal burns as well. Terrestrially, gravity draws colder, denser air to the base of flames, thereby displacing hotter, lighter air upward. In a microgravity environment, flames do not exhibit upward flow and thus produce more unpredictable behaviours for combustion. Flames in microgravity also may survive in less oxygen environments and burn for longer periods of time, thus increasing risk of thermal burns if an uncontrolled fire were to ignite.

### Antarctica eye study: a prospective study of the effects of overwintering on ocular parameters and visual function [^115Y91Pj]. BMC Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

There are many potential causes of ocular damage in an extreme environment such as Antarctica. These include factors such as exposure of the cornea to the extreme cold, high altitude, excessive UV light, trauma and a diet lacking in nutrients beneficial to the eye. Although the data need to be interpreted cautiously due to the limited number of eyes and individuals studied, the results presented here suggest that the explorers did not experience any detremental effects to their eyes or visual function and that future expeditions in this context are likely to be safe.

At the post-expedition follow-up examination, we identified very little change in VA, IOP, colour and contrast sensitivity, and identified no visual field defects or worsening of refractive error. Furthermore, anterior and posterior segment examination was normal. Our results show that an 8-month period spent in Antarctica is unlikely to affect these ocular parameters in those with healthy eyes. It is possible that a more prolonged stay in Antarctica, repeated visits to the polar regions or visits by those with a significant ophthalmic history may lead to ocular damage. An unlikely but possible scenario is that the eyes had time to return to normal between the end of the Antarctic expedition and our post-expedition follow-up. However, this is unlikely as we would expect to find intra-expedition changes to these visual parameters. It is also possible for further damage to reveal itself in the months or years after the post-expedition follow-up. Future studies should aim to follow-up Antarctic explorers years after the Antarctic expeditions to identify if any new pathology has developed.

### International olympic committee (IOC) consensus paper on sports-related ophthalmology issues in elite sports [^116JDHg6]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

All these elements, symptoms of discomfort or pain, fluctuating vision, glare or even photophobia, are directly influenced by the environment. Athletes can, therefore, be particularly sensitive to the environment they are exposed to. Even more at risk are those individuals who suffer from pre-existing ocular surface pathology: dryness, contact lens wear, skin diseases (eg, seborrheic or atopic dermatitis, rosacea) or allergies. Refractive surgery is of particular significance among the specific risk factors potentially encountered in the sports population. The athlete can, thanks to these procedures, participate in sport without glasses or contact lenses with an undeniable benefit, but dry eye induced in particular by the transection of the corneal nerves can affect up to 30% of individuals with sometimes persistent severe symptoms, and even neuropathic pain that is very difficult to relieve. Several cases of suicide have been reported and publicised in the United States, precisely for chronic post-LASIK pain.

Regarding dry eye and ocular pain therapies, preservative-containing tear substitutes, largely available in OTC, should be avoided as preservatives may aggravate tear instability and cause toxic side effects. Care should be taken to avoid potentially forbidden treatments, like steroids or hormone therapy, cannabinoids or other pain-relievers.

Ultraviolet light exposure and the athlete's eyes

Besides acute trauma, sports medicine physicians should also be mindful of injuries from excessive exposure to UV light. Sports at increased risk include sailing, surfing and snow sports, where UV rays are reflected off the sea surface and snow, amplifying the exposure. Excessive UV exposure to the eyes increases the risk of photokeratosis (snow blindness), pinguecula (protein and fat deposits over the sclera, causing eye irritation and disrupting the tear film), pterygium (surfer's eye, a soft tissue growth that extends from the sclera to the cornea, creeping into the visual axis in severe cases), cataract, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the eyelids, and to some degree also the risk for age-related macular degeneration. However, in adulthood, exposure of the retina to UV radiation is reduced due to decreasing transmission properties of the natural lens. These risks can also be effectively reduced using UV-blocking sunglasses and hats.

### Photokeratitis among restaurant workers: a case series [^115n6nUa]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

This case report highlights the challenges associated with the diagnosis and workplace evaluation of occupationally acquired ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced photokeratitis and associated skin burns in a group of restaurant workers. UV-C spectrum bulbs were inadvertently shipped and installed in insect light traps. Ocular and dermal symptoms were reported in 18 of 85 restaurant employees to varying degrees of severity over a 2-day period. One patient was formally diagnosed with a chemical burn/irritation of the cornea. More severe symptoms were reported by individuals working in close proximity to the lights. This clinical picture can resemble mass chemical or irritant exposure when multiple individuals are affected, and a multidisciplinary approach was required for rapid identification of the source to limit morbidity. Prevention strategies for similar events should be considered which can include limiting hardware compatibility and improving warning labels.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of lightning injuries: 2014 update [^112jBzKR]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Lightning injuries — regional considerations highlight weather, geography, and situational risks: Lightning strikes are not uniformly distributed around the Earth, and thunderstorms are formed by 3 atmospheric elements: moisture, warm air on the surface of the earth, and a lifting wind. Geography influences incidence, with Central Africa having the greatest incidence of lightning strikes because of its mountainous terrain coupled with moist airflow from the Atlantic Ocean, leading to year-round thunderstorms; worldwide, rural populations have been at greatest risk, attributed to higher occupational exposure and limited access to substantial buildings for shelter. Though rare, lightning is possible even if the overlying sky is blue (so-called bolt from the blue) and can occur in sunny conditions after a storm, posing a risk to people who return to outdoor activity too soon; lightning is also possible in snowstorms, and graupel heralds weather favorable to lightning formation by generating the electrical gradient that facilitates lightning formation.

### Corneal thermal burn injuries during long-duration spaceflight: mechanisms, evaluation, and management [^111qjnFE]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Although the risk for corneal thermal burn during spaceflight is low, awareness of the risks and prevention (e.g. safety goggles) may mitigate the need for potentially mission threatening interventions. Onboard ocular imaging technology supported by remote guidance on the Earth can manage most minor (e.g. corneal abrasion) or mild (eyelid thermal exposure) injuries. More severe injuries pose a greater risk in austere and distant environments (e.g. the moon or Mars) and AI enabled autonomous or semi-autonomous telemedicine may be useful countermeasures especially given the potential communication signal delay created by long distance space exploration. Testing these risk protocols in advance including virtual reality and computerized simulation may be warranted to reduce the risk for future long duration space travel.

Conclusions

Damage to ocular surface in children caused by chemical burns has long-term effects. Despite standard management, short-term visual outcomes are not encouraging. This leads to disappointment among patients and caregivers. Primary preventative measures to reduce the risk of ocular chemical damage in children involve the implementation of child-safe containers located in protected or out-of-reach drawers. It would minimize the severity of the injury and possibility of major sequelae.

### Solar ultraviolet B radiation promotes α-MSH secretion to attenuate the function of ILC2s via the pituitary-lung axis [^114JcwhZ]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Our studies described the inhibitory effects of UVB irradiation of the eyes on allergic disease in mice experiments. The amounts of UV exposure given were realistic and could be obtained with 10 min of summer sun exposure. With the mechanisms of UV irradiation better understood, we may be able to utilize the positive regulatory effects while avoiding the carcinogenic effects of UV exposure. Our studies in mice complement anecdotal reports that vacationing in the mountains (high altitude) or at the beach (torrid zone) with prolonged sun exposure is beneficial in reducing asthma symptoms. Sunlight exposure can also be considered a strategic health supplement, especially in "low doses", which are helpful beyond the role in vitamin D synthesis. A more comprehensive analysis of human-environment interactions may lead to the development of therapeutics, which might benefit various pathologies and control many systemic immune diseases, not only allergic airway diseases.

Importantly, conditional deletion of the Mc5r gene led to higher ILC2 responses and severe lung inflammation in mice. These observations may be related to a-MSH autocrine under inflammatory conditions. Previous reports have demonstrated that asthmatic patients have elevated concentrations of α-MSH in BALF compared with healthy individuals. Similarly, a similar phenomenon has been observed in experimental allergic mice. Therefore, we hypothesized that during the inflammation of the lungs of the body, systemic production of α-MSH increased, and negatively regulates the aggravation of lung inflammation through MC5R on ILC2s, thereby maintaining the homeostasis of the airway inflammation. While studies on the developmental roles of IL-7/IL-7R signaling in ILC2 are substantial, research on its effector functions is relatively modest. IL-7 was recognized as an important factor in T cell development long before its role in effector function was examined. IL-7 is primarily produced in primary lymphoid tissues, such as bone marrow and thymic stromal cells, where immune cell development occurs. However, ILC2s respond to multiple cytokines such as IL-33, IL-2, and IL-7, either individually or synergistically to produce effector cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13. So multiple cytokines may have a synergistic role in promoting ILC2 activation.

Overall, our results suggest that the UVB radiation–α-MSH–MC5R axis provides an important inhibitory signal for the modulation of ILC2-induced lung inflammation and introduces α-MSH as a promising therapeutic target in allergic lung inflammation.

### Ultraviolet damage to the eye revisited: eye-sun protection factor (E-SPF ®), a new ultraviolet protection label for eyewear [^114tXp5Z]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

UV-related skin aging and periorbital skin diseases

UVR exerts acute and chronic effects on human skin. Acute responses of normal human skin represent a form of inflammation. Clinical manifestations of acute exposure include erythema, swelling, pain, and pruritus, while delayed reactions are increaed pigmentation and thickness of the epithelium. UV exposure of the skin also modulate immunologic recations and intervenes in Vitamin D synthesis.

Chronic effects include photoaging and photocarcinogenesis. Photoaging is the term used to describe the clinical, histologic, and functional changes in chronically sun-exposed skin areas, including the periorbital skin. Clinical manifestations of photoaged skin include dryness, actinic keratosis, irregular pigmentation, lentigines, wrinkling, stellate pseudoscars, telangiectasia, and inelasticity. Since the periorbital region is not only highly exposed to the sun but is also visually apparent, the perception of an individual's age is primarily influenced by the extent of his/her cutaneous photodamage.–

Mitochondrial DNA is a chromophore for UV-B and UV-A radiation, so the mitochondria of epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts are subject to damage by UVR, leading to point mutations and large-scale deletions which are pathophysiologically causal for photoaging. Certain DNA deletions are increased by up to 10-fold in photoaged skin compared with sun-protected skin in the same individual. Studies support the hypothesis that mitochondrial DNA deletions are an important basis for premature aging at the organ level (photoaging).

Another gene-independent mechanism of damage, ie, activation of the arylhydrocarbon receptor, has been shown to contribute in a relevant way to the UV-B stress response in human skin cells, activating pathways such as increased transcription of genes including cyclooxygenase-2. Photocarcinogenesis includes the development of actinic keratosis, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma. DNA damage to keratinocytes is well demonstrated and an established risk factor for malignancies in the periorbital region. DNA is one of the most prominent chromophores that absorb UV-B.

### The devastating effects a fire burn in a child [^116ngdfA]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Burn injuries are a serious global public health concern with significant worldwide mortality and morbidity rates. Burns are among the most devastating of all injuries, with outcomes ranging from physical impairment and disability to emotional and mental consequences. Paediatric burns requiring treatment often incur significant health and opportunity costs, and frequently result in death or long-term disability. A recent systemic review showed that almost 50% of patients hospitalised with severe burns in Europe were younger than 16years of age, and nearly 60% were male. This report discusses the case of a 2-year-old boy with second and third-degree skin burns over almost 45% of his body, including his head and arms, who presented to the eye clinic at the State Hospital in Hakkari 1month after a fire burn accident. Both eyes had been burnt and the bilateral anterior chambers had been injured so badly that the patient was left blind.

### Management of burns [^113vX7Xy]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on burn injury:

- Definition: Burn injuries are defined as damage to the skin or other body tissues caused by heat, electricity, chemicals, or radiation.
- Pathophysiology: The pathophysiology of burn injuries involves the destruction of skin layers, which triggers an immune and inflammatory response, metabolic changes, and potentially distributive shock.
- Epidemiology: The incidence of burn injury in the US is estimated at 140 per 100,000 person-years.
- Risk factors: The risk factors for burn injuries include self-inflicted injuries or abuse/neglect, lack of social support resources, inadequate housing and food resources, and substance use disorders, including alcohol.
- Disease course: Clinically, burn injuries present with redness, blistering, and skin damage. The severity of these symptoms can vary depending on the depth and extent of the burn. Superficial burns may only cause redness and pain, while deeper burns can lead to blistering, skin necrosis, and even systemic symptoms such as shock.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The prognosis of burn injuries can vary widely, depending on factors such as the severity and extent of the burn, the patient's overall health, and the presence of complications. Burns involving a large percentage of the body surface area or those that result in inhalation injury can have a poor prognosis.

### Are surfers and scuba divers an overlooked at-risk group for age-related macular degeneration? [^114aGwPA]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

The potential consequences of cumulative exposure to UV and BL are biologically plausible and clinically relevant. UV-B radiation has been implicated in pterygium and photokeratitis, while both UV-A and BL are increasingly associated with cataractogenesis and AMD. These risks may be amplified in individuals who engage in prolonged surface-level exposure without adequate eye protection, particularly in high UV-index regions such as Australia, Hawaii and Southeast Asia.

Efforts are needed to understand how dynamic outdoor environments shape ocular health and to safeguard the vision of a growing global community. Here, we argue that the lack of ocular research with surfers and divers represents a potential blind spot in our understanding of the environmental impact on eye health. Interdisciplinary efforts to integrate ophthalmology, environmental optics, and sports medicine are warranted to evaluate the nature and magnitude of risk in this population. Empirical insight is needed to inform both clinical surveillance and the development of targeted protective interventions, such as UV/BL-filtering masks, surf-appropriate eyewear, and/or behavioural recommendations.

### Sun exposure in travelers | Yellow book… [^115PsiXE]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

The UVI ranges from 0 to 11+. Higher UVIs indicate greater risks for skin- and eye-damaging UVR. Global data for many sites outside the United States are available on the World Health Organization website, where one can download a smartphone application that gives the UVI for global locations. Consequences Sunburn Sunburn is a common and self-limited condition. It is also preventable. Both UVA and UVB can cause sunburns, which is why people should use broad-spectrum sunscreens that protect from both types of UVR. Clinical features of sunburn vary from mild pink to painful red skin with edema and blisters on exposed surfaces. Systemic symptoms can include headache, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or muscle aches. Sunglasses Protecting one's eyes is a necessary but often overlooked part of UVR protection.

Anytime one is outside during daylight, eyes are exposed to various amounts of UVR, which can have short- and long-term effects that may damage the eyes and affect vision. UVR can penetrate clouds and haze, so people should protect their eyes regardless of atmospheric conditions. Wearing sunglasses is the paramount step in protecting one's eyes from UVR. UVA can harm central vision by damaging the macula in the back of the eye. UVB can damage the cornea and lens in the front of the eye. Intense UVB exposure, even over several hours, can cause corneal sunburn, also called photokeratitis or snow blindness. It is an exquisitely painful condition. The sensitivity to light can force a person to keep their eyes closed for several hours or more. Snow blindness can occur when UVR reflected off snow nearly doubles the amount of UVB that reaches the eyes.

Other symptoms include copious tearing, injected sclera, or a gritty foreign-body sensation of the eye. These symptoms are usually temporary and rarely cause permanent damage to the eyes — but corneal burns are extremely disabling during the painful hours that one must keep the eyes closed. Long-term UVR exposure can lead to cataract formation, age-related macular degeneration, benign conjunctival growths of scar tissue, and cancers of the eyelids and conjunctiva.

### NIOSH fast facts: protecting yourself from sun exposure… [^112WKv73]. CDC (2020). Medium credibility.

NIOSH Fast Facts: Protecting Yourself from Sun Exposure April 2010 DHHS Publication Number 2010–116 Anyone working outdoors is exposed to the sun's ultraviolet rays, even on cloudy days. UV rays are a part of sunlight that is an invisible form of radiation. There are three types of UV rays. UVA is believed to damage connective tissue and increase the risk for developing skin cancer. UVB penetrates less deeply into the skin, but can still cause some types of skin cancer. Natural UVC is absorbed by the atmosphere and does not pose a risk. Sunburn Sunburn is not immediately apparent. Symptoms usually start about 4 hours after sun exposure, worsen in 24–36 hours, and resolve in 3–5 days. They include red, tender and swollen skin, blistering, headache, fever, nausea, and fatigue. In addition to the skin, eyes can become sunburned. Sunburned eyes become red, dry, painful, and feel gritty. Chronic eye exposure can cause permanent damage, including blindness.

First Aid
- Take aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen to relieve pain, headache, and fever.
- Drink plenty of water to help replace fluid losses.
- Comfort burns with cool baths or the gentle application of cool wet cloths.
- Avoid further exposure until the burn has resolved.
- Use of a topical moisturizing cream, aloe, or 1% hydrocortisone cream may provide additional relief. If blistering occurs:

- Lightly bandage or cover the area with gauze to prevent infection.
- Do not break blisters.
- When the blisters break and the skin peels, dried skin fragments may be removed and an antiseptic ointment or hydrocortisone cream may be applied. Seek medical attention if any of the following occur:

- Severe sunburns covering more than 15% of the body
- Dehydration
- High fever
- Extreme pain that persists for longer than 48 hours.
- Apply liberally at least 20 minutes before sun exposure.
- Apply to ears, scalp, lips, neck, tops of feet, and backs of hands.
- Reapply at least every 2 hours and each time a person gets out of the water or perspires heavily.

### Ultraviolet radiation | Radiation and your health… [^112Mbdoa]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance Taking steps to protect yourself from the sun is important. Overexposure to ultraviolet radiation can lead to serious health issues, including cancer. Protect yourself and others from the sun with shade, a shirt, or sunscreen all year long. Benefits
- The production of vitamin D, a vitamin essential to human health. Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium and phosphorus from food and assists bone development. The World Health Organization recommends 5 to 15 minutes of sun exposure 2 to 3 times a week. Risks
- Sunburn is a sign of short-term overexposure, while premature aging and skin cancer are side effects of prolonged UV exposure.
- UV exposure increases the risk of potentially blinding eye diseases if eye protection is not used.
- Overexposure to UV radiation can lead to serious health issues, including cancer. Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States.

The two most common types of skin cancer are basal cell cancer and squamous cell cancer. Typically, they form on the head, face, neck, hands, and arms because these body parts are the most exposed to UV radiation. Most cases of melanoma, the deadliest kind of skin cancer, are caused by exposure to UV radiation. Anyone can have harmful health effects from UV radiation, but the risks increase in people who
- Spend a lot of time in the sun or have been sunburned.
- Have light-color skin, hair, and eyes.
- Take some types of oral and topical medicines, such as antibiotics, birth control pills, and benzoyl peroxide products, as well as some cosmetics. These medications may increase skin and eye sensitivity to UV in all skin types.
- Have a family member with skin cancer.
- Are over age 50. To protect yourself from UV radiation
- Stay in the shade, especially during midday hours.
- Wear clothes that cover your arms and legs.
- Consider options to protect your children.
- Wear a wide brim hat to shade your face, head, ears, and neck.
- Wear wraparound sunglasses that block both UVA and UVB rays.
- Use sunscreen with sun protection factor 15 or higher, for both UVA and UVB protection.
- Avoid indoor tanning. Indoor tanning is particularly dangerous for younger users; people who begin indoor tanning during adolescence or early adulthood have a higher risk of developing melanoma.
