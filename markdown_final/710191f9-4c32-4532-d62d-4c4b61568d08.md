## Question

Shoulder pain in menopause

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about shoulder pain in menopause, specifically its prevalence, mechanisms, specific shoulder pathologies, modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors, diagnostic approach, and management options, including the role of hormone therapy and when to escalate care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiology and whether shoulder pain increases around menopause. Then, I should verify the biological plausibility linking estrogen decline to musculoskeletal pain. Next, I will examine specific shoulder conditions that emerge in this window, followed by risk factors and a practical diagnostic framework. After that, I need to appraise management, including conservative measures, injections, and the nuanced evidence on hormone therapy. Finally, I will consider special populations and red flags, and synthesize a pragmatic clinical algorithm with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiology. Multiple longitudinal and cross-sectional studies show that musculoskeletal pain rises through the menopausal transition, with shoulder pain commonly reported and often multi-site, and the prevalence and severity tend to increase from premenopause to perimenopause to postmenopause, frequently exceeding 60% in postmenopausal cohorts, which supports a temporal association with hormonal change rather than aging alone [^402a0b5e] [^7ad56d71] [^0337d296].

> Wait, let me verify the biological plausibility before inferring causality. Estrogen receptors are present in joint tissues, and estrogen decline can impair chondrocyte function, increase pro-inflammatory cytokines, and alter pain processing, which provides a mechanistic basis for increased musculoskeletal pain around menopause; observational and experimental data also link lower estrogen to more chronic musculoskeletal pain, though confounding by age and comorbidity must be considered [^0c536a6b] [^c0496910] [^55de2099].

> I will now examine specific shoulder pathologies that cluster in this window. Adhesive capsulitis is notably more prevalent in perimenopausal women, with one study showing 35.4% of perimenopausal shoulder arthralgia due to frozen shoulder, and shoulder synovitis is significantly more common in perimenopausal than premenopausal women, which may respond to a short, carefully tapered course of oral glucocorticoids in selected cases; asymptomatic rotator cuff tears also increase after menopause and correlate with metabolic risk, underscoring the need to screen for cardiometabolic comorbidity when tears are found [^ddc5beef] [^0d40e568].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about estrogen alone. I should review other contributors. Higher BMI, physical inactivity, anxiety and depression, and multi-site pain are consistently associated with greater musculoskeletal pain during the menopausal transition, and experimental data suggest testosterone and SHBG may also modulate chronic multisite pain, including neck and shoulder pain, indicating that sex steroid milieu beyond estrogen may be relevant in some patients [^402a0b5e] [^430752ea] [^a449343c].

> Next, I should review a diagnostic approach that distinguishes mechanical from inflammatory and systemic drivers. Let me think about a practical framework: characterize pain quality and distribution, screen for red flags, assess range of motion to separate adhesive capsulitis from rotator cuff disease, and use ultrasound when rotator cuff pathology is suspected or when guiding injections; given the high prevalence of asymptomatic tears in postmenopausal women, imaging must be interpreted in clinical context to avoid overtreatment [^9ec365c6] [^0d40e568].

> I need to ensure management aligns with evidence and safety. Conservative care remains first-line: education, activity modification, load management, and progressive rehabilitation targeting scapular mechanics and rotator cuff strengthening; corticosteroid injections can provide short-term relief for subacromial bursitis or adhesive capsulitis, but I should confirm we avoid repeated injections given potential adverse effects on tendon integrity, especially in older adults [^ca995ec2] [^482bd7f9].

> Now, hormone therapy is where I should be cautious and precise. Randomized and observational data suggest modest reductions in joint pain with estrogen-alone or estrogen–progestin therapy, including WHI analyses and a meta-analysis showing fewer joint symptoms with hormone therapy, yet benefits are modest and must be balanced against individual risks; major guidelines advise using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, with particular caution in women with thrombotic risk or breast cancer history, so I should individualize decisions and document shared decision-making [^b3a3b4ca] [^79a0c0e0] [^8e350322].

> But wait, what if the patient is on or being considered for aromatase inhibitors? I should double-check that this is a distinct pain phenotype. Aromatase inhibitor–associated arthralgia is common and often multifocal, including the shoulders, and may respond to exercise, duloxetine, or switching agents; recognizing this pattern prevents mislabeling as inflammatory arthritis and directs appropriate nonhormonal management [^notfound].

> I will now examine special populations and red flags. Breast cancer survivors have elevated risk of adhesive capsulitis, particularly after mastectomy, axillary dissection, or reconstruction, so early screening and gentle, progressive mobilization are key; conversely, a new frozen shoulder in a patient without classic risk factors warrants consideration of paraneoplastic etiologies, though population data are mixed and vigilance rather than routine cancer screening is reasonable [^04d232b3] [^f315aa83].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency. Shoulder pain in menopause reflects a biopsychosocial model in which estrogen decline lowers the threshold for pain and may promote specific shoulder pathologies like synovitis and adhesive capsulitis, while modifiable factors such as adiposity, inactivity, mood disturbance, and metabolic disease amplify symptom burden; therefore, management should combine targeted rehabilitation, judicious injections, optimization of cardiometabolic health, and selective, risk-stratified consideration of hormone therapy, with imaging reserved for refractory or unclear cases to avoid overtreatment of incidental findings [^0c536a6b] [^402a0b5e] [^9ec365c6].

---

Shoulder pain is common in menopause and is strongly linked to **estrogen decline** [^0c536a6b], which increases the risk of adhesive capsulitis, rotator cuff tendinopathy, and synovitis [^ddc5beef]. Prevalence rises from 43.8% in premenopause to 65.7% postmenopause, with higher severity and multi-site involvement [^7ad56d71] [^402a0b5e]. Management should prioritize **conservative care** (physical therapy, NSAIDs, corticosteroid injections) [^ca995ec2] [^482bd7f9]; hormone therapy may modestly reduce joint pain [^79a0c0e0] but is not first-line for shoulder pain alone [^notfound]. Persistent or severe pain warrants imaging to exclude rotator cuff tears or other structural disease [^9ec365c6].

---

## Epidemiology and prevalence

- **Prevalence**: Musculoskeletal pain increases during menopause, with shoulder pain rising from 43.85% premenopause to 65.74% postmenopause [^7ad56d71].
- **Severity**: Pain severity and multi-site involvement increase with menopausal progression [^402a0b5e].
- **Specific conditions**: Adhesive capsulitis and rotator cuff tendinopathy are more common in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women [^ddc5beef] [^0d40e568].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several **biological mechanisms** link menopause to shoulder pain:

| **Mechanism** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Estrogen decline | Estrogen loss increases inflammation, reduces collagen synthesis, and alters joint biomechanics, promoting tendinopathy and adhesive capsulitis [^0c536a6b] [^55de2099] |
| Synovial inflammation | Higher prevalence of shoulder synovitis in perimenopausal women, responsive to corticosteroids [^ddc5beef] |
| Central sensitization | Hormonal changes may amplify pain perception, contributing to chronic shoulder pain [^0c536a6b] |

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

- **Symptoms**: Shoulder stiffness, restricted range of motion, night pain, and difficulty with daily activities are common [^04d232b3].
- **Diagnosis**: Clinical evaluation plus ultrasound or MRI for suspected rotator cuff tears or adhesive capsulitis [^9ec365c6].
- **Differential**: Exclude cervical radiculopathy, osteoarthritis, and referred visceral pain [^ca995ec2].

---

## Risk factors

- **Age**: Incidence peaks in the 50s, coinciding with menopause [^ca995ec2].
- **BMI**: Higher BMI increases risk of musculoskeletal pain and adhesive capsulitis [^402a0b5e] [^0d40e568].
- **Comorbidities**: Diabetes, thyroid disease, and cardiovascular disease elevate risk [^ca995ec2].
- **Lifestyle**: Physical inactivity and sedentary work contribute to pain severity [^402a0b5e].

---

## Management strategies

### Conservative management

Conservative management is **first-line** and includes physical therapy focused on restoring range of motion and strengthening, along with NSAIDs for pain and inflammation. Corticosteroid injections provide short-term relief for adhesive capsulitis or bursitis [^482bd7f9].

---

### Hormone therapy

Hormone therapy may modestly reduce joint pain frequency and severity [^79a0c0e0] [^b3a3b4ca], but it is **not indicated solely for shoulder pain** and should be individualized based on overall risk–benefit profile [^8e350322].

---

### Surgical interventions

Surgery is reserved for **refractory cases** with confirmed rotator cuff tears or advanced osteoarthritis that fail conservative care [^ca995ec2].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis varies by condition: adhesive capsulitis often resolves over 1–3 years but can recur, whereas rotator cuff tears may persist without surgery. Recurrence is common without ongoing rehabilitation or addressing **modifiable risks** [^04d232b3] [^ca995ec2].

---

## Preventive measures

Preventive strategies include regular weight-bearing and resistance exercise to maintain joint integrity, weight management to reduce mechanical load, and screening for metabolic and endocrine comorbidities. Patient education on early symptoms and prompt treatment helps limit progression [^402a0b5e] [^0d40e568].

---

Shoulder pain in menopause is common and multifactorial, driven by estrogen decline and compounded by age, BMI, and comorbidities. Most patients improve with **conservative care**, while hormone therapy may offer modest benefit in selected women. Persistent or severe cases need targeted imaging and specialist referral.

### How is age at menopause and reproductive lifespan associated with chronic pain outcomes in postmenopausal women? [^20cad7ee]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3.3. Tromsø chronic pain

Chronic pain was measured with a single questionnaire item: "Do you have persistent or recurrent pain that has lasted for at least 3 months", with optional answers "Yes" and "No". Participants who answered "Yes" on this item were defined as having chronic pain.

2.3.4. Graphical index of pain chronic widespread pain

We have used GRIP tier 2 pain locations, chronic widespread pain was defined as chronic pain lasting at least 3 months and if pain intensity is more than 0, in at least 4 out of 5 body regions in combination with a total pain site score ≥ 7 out of possible 19 sites. The 5 body regions included axial region (neck, upper back, lower back), right/left upper region (lower arm, upper arm, shoulder), and right/left lower region (lower leg, upper leg, hip). Total pain site score calculation was based on 19 pain sites including pain sites from the 5 body regions and additional pain sites, such as s chest, abdomen, left jaw, and right jaw. We used GRIP tier 2 information on specific body sites and created a binary chronic widespread pain variable.

2.4. Covariates

In the literature, body mass index (BMI), age at menarche, education, age, duration of smoking (years), alcohol consumption, physical activity at leisure, number of children, duration of using hormonal contraceptives (years), and duration of using hormonal therapy (HT; years) have been associated with both age at menopause and chronic pain outcomes, and thus, we considered them possible confounders to be included as covariates in the analysis.

Body mass index was calculated using measurements of height and weight, as kg/m 2. As described in 2.3.1, age at menarche was included as a continuous variable.

Education was accounted for by the questionnaire item: "What is the highest level of education you have completed?" with the response categories 1 — primary/partly secondary education (up to 10 years), 2 — upper secondary education (minimum 3 years), 3 — college/university (less than 4 years), and 4 — college/university (4 years and more).

### Associations between the severity of menopausal symptoms and musculoskeletal pain in postmenopausal Portuguese women [^793e7dc4]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To analyze the association of the severity of the menopausal symptoms with musculoskeletal pain in Portuguese postmenopausal women.

Methods

A cross-sectional, observational study was conducted on 167 women (63.85 ± 9.36years). The Menopause Rating Scale was used to evaluate the menopausal symptoms severity, while the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire was employed to assess the localization of the musculoskeletal pain, and multi-located pain was determined if two or more body regions were affected. Depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), age, body mass index (BMI) and physical activity level were considered as potential confounders.

Results

A greater severity of the somato-vegetative menopausal symptoms was related to the prevention from usual activities because of pain in the neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists/hands and knees (R 2 of Nagelkerke = 0.064, 0.043, 0.074, 0.045 and 0.045, respectively). Associations were also observed between greater age and pain in the knees, ankles and feet (R 2 of Nagelkerke = 0.036 and 0.034, respectively), and being physically inactive with upper back pain (R 2 of Nagelkerke = 0.060). Higher depressive symptoms were linked to pain in the hip/thighs and knees (R 2 of Nagelkerke = 0.067 and 0.085, respectively), as well as being physically inactive was related ton in the neck (R 2 of Nagelkerke = 0.053). Only a greater BMI was related to multi-located pain in the last 7days (R 2 of Nagelkerke = 0.041).

Conclusions

The findings of our study showed that, taking into account possible confounders, greater severity of the menopausal symptoms at a somatic-vegetative level was associated with more anatomical regions with musculoskeletal pain.

### Perimenopausal arthralgia in the shoulder [^ddc5beef]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate perimenopausal arthralgia in the shoulder and treatment thereof.

Methods

Participants with perimenopausal (n = 197) or premenopausal (n = 113) shoulder arthralgia were included in the study. The prevalences of synovitis, adhesive capsulitis, rotator cuff disorder, arthritis, and other pathologies in the two groups were compared. Participants diagnosed with synovitis were treated with oral prednisolone for 9 to 12 weeks.

Results

The most common diagnosis in the perimenopausal and premenopausal groups was adhesive capsulitis (35.4% and 31.8%, respectively), but the difference in prevalence between the two groups was not significant (P = 0.532). The second most common diagnosis in the perimenopausal group was shoulder synovitis (25.1%), the prevalence of which was significantly higher than that in the premenopausal group (6.2%; P < 0.001). An improvement after treatment with oral prednisolone was reported by 92.9% of the 56 participants diagnosed with shoulder synovitis.

Conclusions

In this study, we evaluated the relationship between menopause and shoulder arthralgia, specifically synovitis. These findings can help clinicians correctly diagnose and treat shoulder arthralgia in perimenopausal women.

1. Introduction

Female sex is a major risk factor for developing chronic widespread pain (CWP), including fibromyalgia, and chronic pain (CP) in specific body sites such as head, low back pain (LBP), temporomandibular joint, and abdominal pain. Although CP and CWP are common in men, higher prevalence rates are consistently reported by women with some minor exceptions, a pattern that may point to hormonal and reproductive differences between sexes as risk factors. Few studies directly measured the levels of sex hormones in peri-and postmenopausal women. The Rotterdam Study measured estrogen, testosterone, androstenedione, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone in women aged 45+ years and found that women with the lowest levels of estrogen, androstenedione, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone had more chronic musculoskeletal pain (MSP). Their findings remained consistent across body sites and adjustment for confounders, including diagnosed osteoarthritis and years since menopause. Liu et al.investigated the effects of aromatase inhibitor therapy in a sample of women with breast cancer, known as medically induced estrogen deprivation, on estrogen levels and MSP. After treatment, low estrogen levels were associated with higher MSP.

### Prevalence of and risk factors for asymptomatic rotator cuff tears in postmenopausal women [^0d40e568]. Menopause (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Rotator cuff tendon tears increase with age, but no study has specifically addressed prevalence changes in women from premenopause to postmenopause. The aims of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of rotator cuff asymptomatic tears in postmenopausal women and to study their relationship with anthropometric and metabolic measures.

Methods

Premenopausal and postmenopausal women who were free from shoulder pain/functional impairment were enrolled. Body mass index (BMI), fasting glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were evaluated. Both shoulders were examined by ultrasound imaging. For the purposes of this study, only full-thickness tears (classified as small, large, or massive) were taken into account.

Results

The prevalence of full-thickness tears (mainly localized in the supraspinatus tendon of the dominant side) was significantly higher in the postmenopausal group (8.9% vs 3.1%), with small, medium, and large tears in 60%, 20%, and 20% of cases, respectively. In women with tears, intragroup comparison showed significantly higher values for BMI and fasting glucose, and lower levels of HDL cholesterol; no difference was found for triglycerides and total cholesterol in premenopausal and postmenopausal women, respectively. On multiple logistic regression analysis, the probability of detecting a tear in both groups was positively related to high values of BMI and lower levels of HDL cholesterol.

Conclusions

The prevalence of asymptomatic full-thickness tears is increased in the postmenopausal period, and there is an association between tears and metabolic disorders. Because asymptomatic tears have a great potential to evolve into symptomatic painful shoulder, a precocious discovery of this pathology may allow the planning of preventive and therapeutic measures.

### Musculoskeletal pain among Chinese women during the menopausal transition: findings from a longitudinal cohort study [^436f59e8]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

A decrease in estrogen levels may contribute to the accelerated loss of BMD and is associated with menopausal transition and increases the risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures. Previous studies have focused mainly on the correlation between local subchondral bone density and pain, and several studies have shown that a lower BMD of the proximal femur or proximal tibial trabecula was significantly associated with severe knee pain and osteoarthritis. Another study also showed that a high BMD of the lumbar spine (L2-L4) or proximal femur was positively related to the relief of pain after total knee arthroplasty; however, research from South Korea found no link between local BMD and the prevalence or severity of musculoskeletal pain. In our study, total and local BMD were associated with muscle and joint pain and knee pain according to univariate analysis, whereas no statistical significance was found between BMD and the prevalence or severity of musculoskeletal pain according to multivariate analysis. However, although we found a positive correlation between E2 and BMD (data not shown), we did not find a definite association between either E2 or BMD and back pain.

Similarly, although conflicting data exist, several studies have shown that MHT alleviates arthralgia in postmenopausal women to some extent, although there seems to be withdrawal symptoms. But other studies have reported that MHT was unrelated to pain caused by fibromyalgia. The type, dose, and dose pattern of MHT may be among the reasons for these differences. Animal experiments have shown that E2 can exacerbate pain induced by stress, which indicated that the uncertainty of the effectiveness of MHT for women with arthralgia may be attributed to differences in stress levels. In addition, musculoskeletal pain may also be affected by testosterone because some evidence have suggested that testosterone may relieve neck and shoulder pain in womenand reduce rheumatoid arthritis–induced pain. Moreover, other factors may also have an impact on musculoskeletal pain. It is reported that women experiencing other menopausal symptoms were nearly 3 times more likely to develop chronic pain than were those without these symptoms. Chronic degenerative diseases associated with aging, reduced physical activity, and weight gain may also contribute to pain in older women.

### The influence of sex hormones on musculoskeletal pain and osteoarthritis [^0c536a6b]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

The association of female sex with certain rheumatic symptoms and diseases is now indisputable. Some of the most striking examples of this association occur in individuals with musculoskeletal pain and osteoarthritis, in whom sex-dependent changes in incidence and prevalence of disease are seen throughout the lifecourse. Joint and muscle pain are some of the most common symptoms of menopause, and there is increasingly compelling evidence that changes in or loss of sex hormones (be it natural, autoimmune, pharmacological, or surgical) influence musculoskeletal pain propensity and perhaps disease. However, the effects of modulation or replacement of sex hormones in this context are far less established, particularly whether these approaches could represent a preventative or therapeutic opportunity once symptoms have developed. In this Review, we present evidence for the association of changes in sex hormones with musculoskeletal pain and painful osteoarthritis, discussing data from diverse natural, therapeutic, and experimental settings in humans and relevant animal models relating to hormone loss or replacement and the consequent effects on health, pain, and disease. We also postulate mechanisms by which sex hormones could mediate these effects. Further research is needed; however, increased scientific understanding of this complex area could lead to real benefits in musculoskeletal and women's health.

### Potential effect modifiers of the association between physical activity patterns and joint symptoms in middle-aged women [^42b9d9b9]. Arthritis Care & Research (2018). Low credibility.

The relationship between menopausal status and joint symptoms is less clear. In line with other studies, our findings suggest that early or late natural progression through menopause does not seem to be associated with the risk of joint symptoms, OA, or OA‐related joint replacement surgery 16, 42, 43. In contrast, in an Italian study of 42,464 women who consulted the clinic for menopausal problems, those who were postmenopausal were more likely to report having been diagnosed with and treated for OA (OR 1.18 [95% CI 1.08–1.28) 9. It may be that the negative current and previous findings were underpowered to detect a small effect of natural menopause on joint health. Alternatively, as the Italian study involved cross‐sectional analyses of data from a selective sample of women experiencing menopausal problems, their results may not be generalizable to the general female population.

### The association between age at menarche and chronic pain outcomes in women: the troms ø study, 2007 to 2016 [^b89e56f0]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

Pain duration was measured with the questionnaire item: "How long is it since you first felt the pain?", with response categories less than 4 weeks, 1 to 2 months, 3 to 5 months, 6 to 11 months, 1 to 2 years, 3 to 5 years, and more than 5 years. Episode frequency was assessed with the questionnaire item: "During the last 4 weeks: How many days have you had the pain?", and response options ranged from 0 to 28 days. With more than half of the participants reporting pain duration of 5 years or more (56.6%), the variable was recoded to a binary variable < 5 years and ≥ 5 years. Episode frequency in the last 4 weeks was dichotomised to daily pain (28 days) and nondaily pain (1–27 days). Dichotomisation was based on the skewed distribution of the data, with 52.7% of the participants reporting daily pain according to this definition. Episode duration was measured with the questionnaire item: "About how much of the day have you usually had the pain? (only count the time when you are awake)", with response options less than 1 hour, 1 to 2 hours, 3 to 6 hours, 7 to 10 hours, longer than 10 hours, or continuously without a pause. Similarly, episode duration was dichotomised to intermittent pain and constant pain without a pause. Finally, pain intensity was measured on an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS; 0–10) with the anchors "no pain" (0) and "the strongest pain imaginable" (10) in response to the question: "How strong has the pain usually been?"

2.3.4. Chronic widespread pain

Chronic widespread pain was defined by Wolfe and coauthorsas pain in 4 or 5 regions (0–5) and a total pain site score ≥ 7 (0–19 sites). According to this definition, they classified pain sites into 5 body regions: axial region (neck, upper back, and lower back), right/left upper region (lower arm, upper arm, and shoulder), and right/left lower region (lower leg, upper leg, hip). We used information from the second tier of GRIP to create a binary chronic widespread pain variable based on their classification. Four pain sites included in GRIP (chest, abdomen, left jaw, and right jaw) were not part of the 5 body regionsbut contributed to the total pain site score in this study.

### How is age at menopause and reproductive lifespan associated with chronic pain outcomes in postmenopausal women? [^9a140d95]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that women with natural and induced menopause combined have higher prevalence of CP and CWP with earlier onset of menopause and shorter RLS. This hypothesis has been based on the literature pointing out the association between early menopause and pain. Second, supporting evidence shows that with the start of menopause, greater percentage of women experience osteoarthritis and osteoporosis, general muscle, and joint aches, also for many the diagnosis of fibromyalgia coincides with the onset of menopause. In addition, studies stress that bone density is lower in postmenopausal women compared with premenopausal women and age-matched men. Such observations were associated with declined level of estradiol due to transition to menopause. Lower estrogen levels in women older than 45 years were associated with higher occurrence of musculoskeletal pain.

Our study has several strengths, including a relatively large sample size and a broad variety of available covariates in the data set. We differentiated between natural and induced menopause, which helped to see if the associations with pain are affected by menopausal reason status. The limited literature on the impact of HT use and hormonal contraceptives on the onset of menopause prompted us to consider specific variables related to sex hormones, alongside lifestyle and demographic factors, to account for numerous covariates in this observational study. By controlling for early menarche, we indirectly consider other health conditions in our study, as it has been associated with numerous diseases.,

The Tromsø7 survey did not differentiate between perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. Biophysiological changes related to perimenopause may begin around age 35 years. Thus, hormone-level measurement is necessary to confirm the reproductive stage, as age alone does not predict estradiol levels. Recall of initial menopause age exhibited high correlation 20 years later. By contrast, self-reported age at menarche showed a lower correlation, potentially impacting the variable's reliability. We adjusted for hormonal contraceptive use and HT duration and timing, the analysis lacks information about the types and combinations of hormones in the contraceptives.

Moreover, the cross-sectional design may lead to unmeasured confounding, creating uncertainties in findings and potentially overlooking contributing factors. Also, biases could arise from overcontrolling by adjusting for mediators (factors caused by menopause) and controlling for colliders (factors caused by both menopause and pain).

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^197ead16]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Joint pain and osteoarthritis — Direct binding of estrogen to estrogen receptors acts on joint tissues, protecting their biomechanical structure and function and maintaining overall joint health, but the exact effect of estrogen on osteoarthritis remains controversial; there is no clearly observed association between hormone therapy use and osteoarthritis. Meta-analyses of clinical trials of estrogen therapy (ET) have reported inconsistent results, and thus there is insufficient evidence to form strong conclusions regarding the effects of estrogen on osteoarthritis.

### Cardiovascular health after menopause transition, pregnancy disorders, and other gynaecologic conditions: a consensus document from European cardiologists, gynaecologists, and endocrinologists [^f6beff07]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

The decline in endothelial function starts in early menopause even before signs of subclinical atherosclerosis are present. This mechanism may be involved in the pathophysiology of 'undetermined' chest pain and dyspnoea, which is often labelled as 'stress' or to 'menopausal symptoms'. However, women with 'undetermined' chest pain syndromes have a two-fold increased risk of developing an IHD event in the following 5–7 years. The changing hormonal milieu is associated with alterations in body composition. Fat mass increases predominantly in the central and visceral regions, while lean mass decreases after menopause. Visceral adipose tissue secretes inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and retinol-binding protein-4. The efflux of free fatty acids to the liver generates reactive oxygen species. Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress respectively increase insulin resistance. Animal studies indicate that post-gonadectomy oestrogen decline is associated with an impairment of pancreatic β-cell function. In clinical practice, post-menopausal women have 2–3 times higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome, compared to similar aged premenopausal women.

Menopause transition results in lipid profile changes, with a 10–15% higher LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels and slightly lower HDL cholesterol levels. The sharp rise in BP after menopause may be both a direct effect of hormonal changes on the vasculature and metabolic changes with ageing. Hypertension is a critically important risk factor that affects women in the early post-menopausal years and is often poorly managed. Recent data from Canada report a worsening of hypertension awareness and treatment over the past decade, especially in women. In all, 30–50% of women develop hypertension (BP > 140/90 mmHg) before the age of 60 and the onset of hypertension can cause a variety of symptoms, such as palpitations, hot flushes, headaches, chest pain, pain between the shoulder blades, tiredness and sleeping disturbances, which are often attributed to menopause. Sodium sensitivity increases during menopausal transition, frequently leading to intermittent fluid retention (oedema of the legs, hands, and lower eyelids). Physicians should intensify the detection of hypertension in middle-aged women, especially after HPD and pre-eclampsia. Systolic BP is the most important arbiter of risk with ageing and results in greater vascular and myocardial stiffness in women than in men, an important factor in why heart failure with preserved ejection fraction dominates in older women. Sex differences in heart failure have been recently described, hence our focus on IHD.

### Associations between endogenous sex hormones and multisite chronic musculoskeletal pain [^a449343c]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sex-differences in pain perception have been documented; however, the role of sex hormones in chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) remains unclear. Therefore, this study investigated whether sex hormones and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) are associated with CMP.

Methods

We utilised data from the UK Biobank (n = 357 424; females: 51.6%; white: 95.2%). Serum concentrations of oestradiol (E2), testosterone (T), and SHBG were measured at baseline. Chronic pain (≥ 3 months) in the neck/shoulder, back, hip, knee, or 'all over the body' was assessed at baseline and three follow-ups. Mixed-effects multinomial/logistic regression models were used.

Results

In multivariable analyses, greater concentrations of T and T/SHBG were associated with a lower number of CMP sites in both males (T: relative risk ratio = 0.81 per standard deviation, 95% confidence interval [0.77–0.86] and T/SHBG: 0.85 [0.80–0.92]) and females (T: 0.85 [0.81–0.89] and T/SHBG: 0.93 [0.89–0.97] [all P-values for trend ≤ 0.001]). Greater T concentrations and T/SHBG were also associated with lower odds of CMP across all sites, while higher concentrations of SHBG were associated with lower odds of neck/shoulder CMP in both sexes. There was no association between concentrations of E2, SHBG, or E2/SHBG and number of CMP or site-specific CMP in either sex.

Conclusion

In both sexes, greater T concentrations and T/SHBG were associated with lower number of CMP sites and site-specific CMP, while greater concentrations of SHBG were linked to lower odds of neck/shoulder CMP. These findings suggest a potential involvement of sex steroids in the pathogenesis of CMP and underscore the need for further investigation into their potential in chronic pain management strategies.

### How is age at menopause and reproductive lifespan associated with chronic pain outcomes in postmenopausal women? [^4a900dc2]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

4. Discussion

We found a significant association between age at menopause and CP in a sample of women with natural and induced menopause, whereby the prevalence of CP decreased by 1% with every one-year delay of menopause onset. Hence, the impact for a woman who starts menopause at 35 years, the calculated overall relative risk over 14 years to the average age at menopause of 49 years, is an increased prevalence of CP by 9%. Although the association was not significant in the multivariable analysis, we observed the same trend for CWP as for CP in univariable analysis. Similarly, the RLS was associated with CP in univariable but not in multivariable analysis. No statistically significant association between RLS and CWP were found. Sensitivity analysis among women with induced menopause showed no significant association between CP and menopause.

To our knowledge, there are no other comparable publications that looked at the association between CP in general (defined as pain for at least 3 months) and age at menopause in women with natural and induced menopause. However, we identified 2 studies that specifically focused on chronic LBP and menopause. First, a US-based cross-sectional study for the relationship between LBP and age at menopause in the sample of 5325 premenopausal and postmenopausal women. In this study, women with premature menopause, < 30 years and 30 to 39 years, exhibited higher prevalence of LBP than premenopausal women. These findings are consistent with results from our study highlighting that earlier age at menopause enhances the risk of chronic pain among women with natural menopause and induced menopause. Adera et al. did not distinguish between natural and induced menopause; therefore, the results were obtained from a combined sample. In our sample of women with induced menopause, a significant association between CP and menopause was not found. This may be explained by previous findings from a neuroimaging study that observed changes in the brain and endocrine system of women going through menopausal transition compared with premenopausal women. Therefore, the absence of connection between CP and menopause in that sample may be linked to the intricate neuroendocrine processes that distinguish premenopausal, menopausal, and postmenopausal brains.

A 68-year-old postmenopausal woman presented to the gynaecology clinic with a 1-week history of vaginal bleeding. She was investigated to rule out local and systemic causes including genital malignancy. The investigations were negative for genital malignancy and her symptoms settled spontaneously. The bleeding was attributed to a corticosteroid treatment for shoulder joint pain. A short literature review of this rare side effect is discussed.

### Musculoskeletal pain among Chinese women during the menopausal transition: findings from a longitudinal cohort study [^f4f8f645]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

The increasing population of postmenopausal women and the long-term effects on later stages of life have has made menopause a prominent subject of targeted research. Numerous studies have examined vasomotor symptomsand symptoms of anxiety and depression; however, few have investigated musculoskeletal symptoms in women during the menopausal transition. Musculoskeletal symptoms are common within the menopausal population, but the factors associated with these symptoms are still unclear, and their relationship with menopausal stages requires further investigation. Notably, the profiles of insomnia symptoms and anxious and depressive symptoms vary greatly during the menopausal transition. Therefore, it is possible that the profiles of musculoskeletal symptoms differ as well. The trajectories of these symptoms may provide insights into the underlying physiological dysregulation.

Here, the present study aimed to elucidate the association between musculoskeletal symptoms and menopausal stages and to further assess the risk factors associated with musculoskeletal pain in Chinese middle-aged women.

### How is age at menopause and reproductive lifespan associated with chronic pain outcomes in postmenopausal women? [^206d924b]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

Age at menarche has been the most studied proxy measure of estradiol levels across chronic pain outcomes in large population-based studies. In a previous study, we observed that with each one-year delay of menarche the risk of CP decreased by 2%, and CWP decreased by 7%, and similar associations were seen across 10 body regions. Although the evidence is indirect, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that long-term estradiol exposure may increase the risk of CP. If true, this would suggest that late menopause and longer reproductive lifespan (RLS) defined as the time from menarche to menopause should increase this risk. However, studies of age at menopause have found that early menopause is associated with higher prevalence of fibromyalgiaand greater prevalence of LBP among women with menopause before 40 years. A more recent study based on a Norwegian population found no association between LBP and menopause in postmenopausal women aged 40 to 69 years. A British studyshowed no relationship between menopause and CWP in pre-, peri-, and postmenopausal women. Furthermore, early menopause, defined as < 45 years, is linked with higher rheumatoid arthritis activity than onset of menopause ≥ 45 years. Another study indicated that the RLS and years since menopause were independently associated with lower heat pain thresholds, an indicator of sensitisation in patients with chronic MSP. Concisely, earlier menopause seems to be related to more pain, whereby inconsistent with previously stated lifetime estradiol exposure hypothesis.

To date, the relationship between menopause and CP has not accounted for age at menarche, and the potential associations between RLS and CP or CWP have not been investigated in women undergoing natural or induced menopause. We aim to explore these associations in a large population-based sample. Specifically, we test the hypotheses that earlier menopause and shorter RLS increase the prevalence of CP and CWP.

### Clinical questions… [^ca995ec2]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Rotator cuff problems are the most common source of shoulder pain, accounting for more than two-thirds of cases. Rotator cuff disorders are associated with musculoskeletal problems that affect the joints and muscles of the shoulder, cuff degeneration due to aging and ischemia, and overloading of the shoulder. Frozen shoulder accounts for 2 percent of cases of shoulder pain. Risk factors for frozen shoulder include female sex, older age, shoulder trauma and surgery, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thyroid disease. In many persons, the cornerstone of treatment is achieving pain control to permit a return to normal functional use of the shoulder and encouraging this with manual exercises. In persons with acute posttraumatic tear, an early surgical option is warranted.

A second survey, in a community-based rheumatology clinic in the United Kingdom, reported a point prevalence of 21 percent, with a higher frequency in women than men. Seventy percent of cases involved the rotator cuff. Further analysis of 134 persons included in the survey found that 65 percent of cases were rotator cuff lesions, 11 percent were caused by localized tenderness in the pericapsular musculature, 10 percent involved acromioclavicular joint pain, 3 percent involved glenohumeral joint arthritis, and 5 percent were referred pain from the neck. Another survey in Sweden found that in adults, the annual incidence of frozen shoulder was about 2 percent, and those 40 to 70 years of age were most commonly affected. Risk factors for frozen shoulder include female sex, older age, shoulder trauma, surgery, diabetes, cardiorespiratory disorders, cerebrovascular events, thyroid disease, and hemiplegia.

Arthritis of the glenohumeral joint can occur in numerous forms, including primary and secondary osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and crystal arthritides. Shoulder pain can also be referred from other sites, in particular the cervical spine. It can also arise after stroke. Poststroke shoulder pain and referred pain are not addressed in this review. Prognosis One survey in a community of older persons found that most persons with shoulder pain were still affected three years after the initial survey. One prospective cohort study of 122 adults in primary care found that 25 percent of persons with shoulder pain reported previous episodes and 49 percent reported full recovery at 18 months' follow-up.

### What imaging-detected pathologies are associated with shoulder symptoms and their persistence? A systematic literature review [^9ec365c6]. Arthritis Care & Research (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Systematic literature search and selection

Following exclusion of duplicates, 4,383 articles were included, of which 119 met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and were screened. In total, 56 articles were included (41 cross‐sectional, 11 cohort, 4 case–control). Imaging modalities included 25 ultrasound 16, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 24 MRI 15, 16, 41, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 12 radiographs 27, 30, 49, 53, 55, 62, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 3 bone scintigraphy 65, 71, 72, 2 PET 73, 74, and no computed tomography. Of these studies, 10 assessed associations with 2 imaging modalities (16, 27, 30, 41, 44, 49, 53, 55, 62, 65). Most studies included both sexes; 8 studies did not state the sex ratio involved 35, 38, 41, 59, 62, 65, 71, 74, and 1 included males only 34. The nomenclature for defining imaging pathologies varied between studies, and there was no standardized way of defining pathology (see Supplementary Table 3, available on the Arthritis Care & Research web site at). There was heterogeneity between study populations.

### Estrogen alone and joint symptoms in the women's health initiative randomized trial [^79a0c0e0]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Although joint symptoms are commonly reported after menopause, observational studies examining exogenous estrogen's influence on joint symptoms provide mixed results. Against this background, estrogen-alone effects on joint symptoms were examined in post hoc analyses in the Women's Health Initiative randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial.

Methods

A total of 10,739 postmenopausal women who have had a hysterectomy were randomized to receive daily oral conjugated equine estrogens (0.625mg/d) or a matching placebo. The frequency and severity of joint pain and joint swelling were assessed by questionnaire in all participants at entry and on year 1, and in a 9.9% random subsample (n = 1,062) after years 3 and 6. Logistic regression models were used to compare the frequency and severity of symptoms by randomization group. Sensitivity analyses evaluated adherence influence on symptoms.

Results

At baseline, joint pain and joint swelling were closely comparable in the randomization groups (about 77% with joint pain and 40% with joint swelling). After 1 year, joint pain frequency was significantly lower in the estrogen-alone group compared with the placebo group (76.3% vs 79.2%, P = 0.001), as was joint pain severity, and the difference in pain between randomization groups persisted through year 3. However, joint swelling frequency was higher in the estrogen-alone group (42.1% vs 39.7%, P = 0.02). Adherence-adjusted analyses strengthen estrogen's association with reduced joint pain but attenuate estrogen's association with increased joint swelling.

Conclusions

The current findings suggest that estrogen-alone use in postmenopausal women results in a modest but sustained reduction in the frequency of joint pain.

A total of 31 studies were high quality, and 25 were low quality. Six studies did not explain the statistical test used 33, 42, 46, 52, 58, 71. Nine studies did not define pathology. The GRADE quality of evidence for the relationship for all imaging features/symptoms outcomes was very low because of study limitations (risk of bias and observational study design), quality, inconsistency, and indirectness.

### Shorter reproductive time span and early menopause increase the risk of ACPA-negative inflammatory arthritis in postmenopausal women with clinically suspect arthralgia [^9fc55940]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Menopausal factors

Information on menopausal factors was obtained with questionnaires at baseline. The relevant questions were: 'Are you in menopause yet?' and 'Have you had a menstruation the past year?'. Postmenopausal status was defined when patients reported being in menopause and clarified that they had not had a menstruation in the year before inclusion. From 333 women from both cohorts, 12% had missing menopause data. Baseline characteristics of patients with and without missing data differed only on symptom duration (Supplementary Table S1, available at Rheumatology online).

In the postmenopausal women, we studied the association of three factors related to the lifetime exposure to oestrogens during a woman's reproductive lifespan (that is, oestrogen exposure in levels that are present during menstrual cycles) with IA development. Total reproductive years were defined as the age at menopause minus the age at menarche. The age at menarche was derived from the question 'At what age did you get your first period?'. The total number of ovulatory years was defined as the age at menopause minus the age at menarche, minus the total number of children*0.75 (9/12 months of one year when women do not ovulate during a pregnancy), as described before. Finally, early menopause was defined as the age at menopause of ≤ 45 years, derived from the question 'At what age did you get into menopause?'. Unfortunately, information on the use of oral contraceptives or hormonal replacement therapy was not available.

### Musculoskeletal pain among Chinese women during the menopausal transition: findings from a longitudinal cohort study [^b8a343e4]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

Menopause refers to the permanent cessation of menstruation resulting from the depletion of ovarian follicles. The hallmark event of ovarian aging occurs mostly between the ages of 49 and 52 years. Approximately 47 million women worldwide enter postmenopause each year, and the overall population of menopausal and postmenopausal women will exceed 1.2 billion by 2030. With increasing life expectancy, women spend one-third of their lives in the postmenopausal period. The erratically fluctuating and decreasing estrogen levels experienced during the perimenopausal and postmenopausal periods lead to a series of troublesome symptoms, such as vasomotor symptoms, muscle and joint pain, sleep disturbances, emotional distress, and sexual dysfunction, affecting 40% to 60% of perimenopausal women. These distressing symptoms not only considerably affect the social and work lives of womenbut also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, cognitive issues, and other disease processes. Some of these symptoms persist for more than a decade, significantly decreasing the quality of life of the affected women and placing a greater burden on the health care system as a whole.

Compared with men, women exhibit a greater incidence of osteoarthritis after the age of 50 years, indicating that estrogen plays a significant role in the development of osteoarthritis. More than 50% of women experience bothersome menopausal conditions, among which muscle and joint pain is one of the most prevalent symptoms complained by Asian middle-aged women. Studies have suggested that the prevalence of self-reported muscle and joint pain ranges from 53.29% to 82.3%. Although estrogen deficiency during and after menopause seems to be strongly related to the high incidence of muscle and joint pain, the underlying mechanisms between estrogen deficiency and musculoskeletal pain are not precisely known. Certain studies have shown that estrogen replacement therapy can moderately reduce the frequency and severity of knee pain in postmenopausal women, whereas others have shown inconsistent and even contradictory results. Currently, heated debates still exist regarding the therapeutic and preventive effects of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) on muscle and joint pain.

Women's Health Initiative (WHI) — joint symptoms and arthroplasty: In the WHI, CEE plus MPA was associated with less joint pain or stiffness than placebo with reported rates 47.1% versus 38.4% and OR 1.43 (95% CI, 1.24–1.64), and in the CEE-alone arm a statistically significant reduction in joint pain frequency after 1 year compared with placebo was observed (76.3% vs 79.2%; P = 0.001). Using arthroplasty as a clinical indicator of severely symptomatic osteoarthritis, the association of CEE alone with any arthroplasty was borderline significant (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.70–1.00; P = 0.05), while CEE alone did not significantly reduce the risk of hip or knee arthroplasty and the EPT trial showed no relationship between hormone use and arthroplasty risk. Key points state that women in the WHI and other studies have less joint pain or stiffness with hormone therapy compared with placebo (Level I) and that there is a need for further understanding of estrogen's potential effect on joint health (Level III).

### Does menopausal hormone therapy, exercise, or both improve pain and function in postmenopausal women with greater trochanteric pain syndrome? A 2 × 2 factorial randomized clinical trial [^25442a3f]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is a debilitating chronic condition, most prevalent in postmenopausal women. A positive association between high estrogen levels and tendon health may exist, and postmenopausal women have reduced estrogen. Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) may reduce the incidence of tendon abnormality, particularly when combined with exercise.

Purpose

To determine the effect of MHT and exercise on tendon pain and function in postmenopausal women with GTPS.

Study Design

Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 1.

Methods

Postmenopausal women (N = 132; n = 12, lost to follow-up) with GTPS were randomized into MHT and placebo transdermal cream groups combined with tendon-specific or sham exercise. All groups received education about avoiding gluteal tendon compression and load management throughout 12 weeks of intervention. The primary outcome was the Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment for gluteal tendinopathy (VISA-G), and secondary outcomes were measured at baseline and at 12 and 52 weeks. The Global Rating of Change was assessed at 12 and 52 weeks. A linear mixed-effects model was used to assess differences. Body mass index (BMI) was included as a covariate.

Results

All participant groups improved over time (baseline vs 12 weeks, P < .001; baseline vs 52 weeks, P < .001). There was no difference among exercise groups measured by all outcomes (VISA-G: baseline, P = 0.97, mean difference [MD] = 0.10; 12 weeks, P = 0.49, MD = 2.15; 52 weeks, P = 0.32, MD = -3.08). There was a significant interaction effect between cream and BMI; therefore, the population was stratified by BMI levels (< 25, < 30, ≥ 30). The MHT groups (with exercise and education) had significantly better VISA-G outcomes (baseline, P = 0.04, MD = -11.20, 95% CI = -21.70 to -0.70; 12 weeks, P < .001, MD = -20.72, 95% CI = -31.22 to -10.22; 52 weeks, P = 0.002, MD = -16.71, 95% CI = -27.21 to -6.22) and secondary measure scores as compared with placebo at all time points when BMI was < 25.

Conclusion

MHT or placebo combined with tendon-specific or sham exercise plus education reduced pain and increased function for this population. For women with a BMI < 25, MHT with any exercise plus education was better than placebo. A targeted exercise or sham exercise strategy is effective when prescribed with education about avoiding gluteal tendon compression and load management.

### Musculoskeletal pain among Chinese women during the menopausal transition: findings from a longitudinal cohort study [^0337d296]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

4. Discussion

Studies have shown a significant difference in pain prevalence between males and females, that women are more likely than men to experience common chronic pain, and these symptoms even worsen in middle-aged women. Gonadal steroid hormones are believed to play a role in sex differences in pain sensitivity and tolerance. Several studies have shown that women reported more pain and multiple forms of postoperative pain after surgery, although they have fewer proinflammatory biomarkers than men. The etiology of musculoskeletal pain in middle-aged women remains poorly understood. Several studies have revealed that more than half of middle-aged women suffer from chronic muscle and joint pain. Despite the high prevalence of menopausal symptoms among middle-aged women, only a small percentage of women seek treatment for their pain symptoms.

This is a prospective study investigating the trajectories of musculoskeletal pain in Chinese women during midlife. The primary objective of our study was to examine the prevalence of 4 types of musculoskeletal pain and the associated factors during the menopausal transition. And our analysis revealed an even higher prevalence of musculoskeletal pain in Chinese middle-aged women, with the prevalence exceeding 60% in postmenopausal women. The incidence of all types of pain increased with the progression of menopause, except for neck pain, which demonstrated a slight decline from women during menopausal transition to postmenopause. In addition, we further evaluated the severity of each type of musculoskeletal pain, which has rarely been reported in previous studies. We demonstrated that the severity of musculoskeletal pain also worsened as the menopausal stage progressed. The majority of participants suffered from multiple types of musculoskeletal pain. Moreover, we identified general health status as an influencing factor for the occurrence of these symptoms, which suggests that improving perimenopausal health care might be important for preventing or treating these symptoms.

### Potential effect modifiers of the association between physical activity patterns and joint symptoms in middle-aged women [^a4c088dd]. Arthritis Care & Research (2018). Low credibility.

In conclusion, the results suggest that at least low levels of PA should be maintained throughout middle age for women to benefit from the protective effects on joint symptoms in later middle age. Furthermore, the association between PA and joint symptoms is modified by BMI, but not by menopausal status or HT use. Particularly in obese women, a physically active lifestyle contributes to reducing the risk of developing joint symptoms.

Conclusion

This study found 15 common descriptors for shoulder pain quality assessment. Because shoulder pain quality profiles differed between men and women in this study, clinicians and researchers should consider sex-related differences during shoulder pain management. Valid pain quality assessment tools are warranted in additional studies to further confirm the sex-related differences.

### Prevalence and correlates of joint pain among Chinese breast cancer survivors receiving aromatase inhibitor treatment [^248c0258]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Implications and limitations

Study findings indicated that, in clinical practice, in addition to increasing the use of interventions for pain alleviation, there is a need to comprehensively assess the clinical characteristic of breast cancer survivors such as previous use of AI treatment and presence of osteoarthritis to identify the target group for more specific attention. Considering the high incidence of pain in the knees and the negative influence of poor physical well-being/functioning on pain, some specific components can be included in the intervention programme to make it more tailored and effective, for example, promoting survivors' understanding of the importance of physical exercise via health education and providing more upper extremity exercises or low intensity lower extremity exercises. In future research, more studies should be conducted to explore the correlates of AI-induced joint pain in Chinese breast cancer survivors at a genetic level.

This study has some limitations. The study was conducted at one study site using convenience sampling, which might limit its representativeness and the generalizability of the study findings. There might be a risk of over-analysing the results as multiple testing was conducted in this study although only subgroups with relatively adequate sample size were analysed. Although the knee, shoulder, and hand were identified as the top three joint pain locations, further sub-group analyses based on these three locations (e.g. levels of pain in three groups) were not conducted as some patients reported pain at more than two joints which made it difficult to separate the participants into three different groups. Physiotherapy was identified as one of the correlates of joint pain; however, further sub-group analyses based on the types and dose of physiotherapy (e.g. frequency and duration) could not be conducted due to the absence of relevant information. In addition, although most of the participants were postmenopausal patients, there were still a small number of premenopausal or perimenopausal patients who might receive AI treatment in combination with ovarian function suppression; however, relevant treatment information regarding ovarian function suppression in those premenopausal or perimenopausal patients was not collected as a confounding factor to determine to which extent the joint pain was related to the ovarian function suppression.

### Effects of stretching on menopausal and depressive symptoms in middle-aged women: a randomized controlled trial [^b0a73ce0]. Menopause (2016). Low credibility.

Measurements

Menopausal symptoms were assessed using the SMI, which comprised 10 questions assessing vasomotor (4 items; hot flashes, chills, etc), psychological (4 items; mood, sleep disturbances, etc), and somatic (2 items; joint pain, shoulder stiffness) symptoms. The SMI is a survey created to assess menopausal symptoms of Japanese women; this index is frequently used for research and during routine hospital examinations in Japan. The frequency of hot flashes was calculated based on the number of participants experiencing sudden feelings of facial heat.

Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), which is a self-assessment questionnaire that assesses depressive symptoms, and is internationally used for research. Depression was considered present if the SDS score was 40 points or more.

The basic characteristics of the participants, including age, alcohol consumption, smoking habits, job strain score, and total weekly leisure-time moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activities, were examined by a self-reporting questionnaire. Menopausal status was assessed by asking questions related to menstruation. Postmenopausal women were defined as those women without menstrual bleeding during the previous 12 months.

### Potential effect modifiers of the association between physical activity patterns and joint symptoms in middle-aged women [^96fc54fc]. Arthritis Care & Research (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine whether body mass index (BMI), menopausal status, and hormone therapy (HT) use modify the association between physical activity (PA) patterns throughout middle age and the incidence and prevalence of joint symptoms in women in later middle age.

Methods

Data were from 6,661 participants (born 1946–1951) in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health. Surveys, with questions on joint pain and stiffness, PA, height and weight, menopausal symptoms, and HT use, were completed every 3 years from 1998 to 2010. PA patterns were defined as none or low, low or meeting guidelines, fluctuating, or meeting guidelines at all times (reference pattern). Logistic regression was used to examine the association between PA patterns and prevalent (in 2010) and cumulative incident (1998–2010) joint symptoms and effect modification by patterns in BMI, menopausal status, and HT.

Results

The groups representing fluctuating PA (odds ratio [OR] 1.34 [99% confidence interval (99% CI) 1.04–1.72]) and no or low PA (OR 1.60 [99% CI 1.08–2.35]) had higher odds of incident joint symptoms than those described as meeting guidelines at all times. Stratification by BMI showed that this association was statistically significant in the obese group only. No evidence for effect modification by menopausal status or HT use was found. The findings were similar for prevalent joint symptoms.

Conclusion

Maintaining at least low levels of PA throughout middle age was associated with a lower prevalence and incidence of joint symptoms later in life. This apparent protective effect of PA on joint symptoms was stronger in obese women than in under‐ or normal‐weight women, and not related to menopause or HT status.

### Postmastectomy functional impairments [^04d232b3]. Current Oncology Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Adhesive Capsulitis (Frozen Shoulder)

Adhesive capsulitis, commonly known as frozen shoulder, is characterized by pain and significant loss of both passive and active ROM in the glenohumeral joint (Fig. 1). Postmastectomy patients frequently experience shoulder morbidity, affecting anywhere from 1 to 68% of individuals. Restricted ROM can arise due to inflammation and subsequent fibrosis leading to tightening of the glenohumeral joint. Adhesive capsulitis is often regarded as a self-limiting disorder that follows a typical progression through three distinct phases. The first stage, also referred to as the painful freezing stage, lasts for 2 to 9 months. During this phase, individuals experience sharp, diffuse shoulder pain that tends to worsen at night, as well as a gradual increase in stiffness. The pain begins to lessen as adhesive capsulitis enters the second stage, the frozen stage, which normally lasts between 4 and 12 months, while stiffness and loss of ROM in the glenohumeral joint are at their highest. The third stage, sometimes known as the "thawing stage", involves a gradual regaining of ROM and can take anywhere between 5 months and 2 years to complete. While adhesive capsulitis may resolve on its own, investigations suggest that a sizable fraction (20% to 50%) of patients have symptoms that last longer than two years. Factors such as age (50 to 59 years), breast reconstruction, lymphedema, lymph node dissection, and aromatase inhibitor therapy may independently contribute to the risk of developing adhesive capsulitis. Although mastectomy itself does not directly cause damage to the glenohumeral joint, the accompanying pain, tightness in the pectoral muscles, and changes in biomechanics can result in protective postures that place stress and tension on the joint capsule. This can lead to restricted mobility and the subsequent development of secondary adhesive capsulitis.

### Musculoskeletal pain among Chinese women during the menopausal transition: findings from a longitudinal cohort study [^402a0b5e]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The profiles of muscle and joint pain throughout the menopausal transition and the factors associated with these symptoms have not been determined. A total of 609 participants from a longitudinal cohort study conducted in an urban Chinese community were enrolled in this study. We assessed the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms at different menopausal stages and explored the factors associated with these symptoms. The prevalence and severity of muscle and joint pain increase as menopausal stages progress, and late menopausal transition may be a crucial timepoint that triggers the onset of musculoskeletal pain. The results of the multivariate analysis revealed that poor health status (OR = 2.245, 95% CI = 1.714–2.94, P < 0.001), body mass index (BMI) (OR = 1.046, 95% CI = 1.01–1.084, P = 0.011), the presence of anxiety (OR = 1.601, 95% CI = 1.211–2.117, P < 0.001), and depression (OR = 1.368, 95% CI = 1.143–1.639, P < 0.001) were independently associated with muscle and joint pain. In addition, the severity of musculoskeletal pain was related to poor health status (OR = 2.738, 95% CI = 1.91–3.924, P < 0.001) and depression (OR = 1.371, 95% CI = 1.095–1.718, P = 0.006). Musculoskeletal symptoms are frequent somatic symptoms experienced by Chinese middle-aged women. Women with poor health status, high BMI, anxiety, and depression were at heightened risk of experiencing musculoskeletal pain. The severity of pain increased over time.

### A symptomatic approach to understanding women's health experiences: a cross-cultural comparison of women aged 20 to 70 years [^eae0ab1f]. Menopause (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine patterns of symptoms across age groups, identify symptom groups associated with ovarian hormonal depletion or other variables, and develop a prediction model for each symptom.

Design

This was a cross-sectional survey of 4,517 women ages 20 to 70 years recruited from market research panels in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Italy using a self-report questionnaire that included general health information and a checklist of 36 symptoms. Stepwise regression was used to determine for each symptom how prevalence varied with age, indicators of menopausal hormonal changes, and the effects of other explanatory variables, including body mass index, morbidity, and country. Hierarchical clustering was used to group symptoms.

Results

Six groups of symptoms were found, of which two groups, with seven symptoms in total, were related to markers of menopausal hormonal change: a group consisting of hot flashes and night sweats and a second group including poor memory; difficulty sleeping; aches in the neck, head, and shoulders; vaginal dryness; and difficulty with sexual arousal. Physical and mental morbidity affected estimates of the prevalence of all symptoms. Psychological symptoms declined with age from a maximum prevalence before age 40. Certain physical symptoms increased with age and body mass index. Clustering identified three country groups: (1) US and UK women; (2) French and Italian women; and (3) German women. There were marked differences in prevalence between countries for certain physical and psychological symptoms.

Conclusions

The seven symptoms most linked to menopausal hormonal change should form part of any future menopause symptom list. Physical and mental morbidity affect symptom prevalence and should be measured.

### Symptoms and effects of physical factors in Japanese middle-aged women [^a73d5557]. Menopause (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to clarify the prevalence and severity rates of symptoms and investigate whether symptoms varied in relation to body mass index (BMI).

Methods

The study group composed of 1,969 women, aged 40 to 60 years, who presented at our department from 1993 through 2014. The participation rate was 98%. The presence or absence of symptoms was evaluated by having the participants complete the Keio Questionnaire, a self-administered questionnaire. To allow the results to be compared according to ovarian function, serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol were measured. Participants were classified into three groups according to BMI: underweight, normal weight, and overweight. Symptoms were also compared among these subgroups.

Results

The most common symptom was general fatigue. Vasomotor symptoms differed significantly between pre- and postmenopause status. When symptoms were analyzed according to BMI, the severity rates of the following symptoms were significantly higher in the overweight group than in the normal weight and underweight groups: hot flushes, sweats, joint pain, numbness, and incontinence. On the contrary, the underweight group had significantly higher severities of cold constitution, nervousness, and wrinkled skin than did the other groups. In addition, an increase in BMI was associated with an increased severity of vasomotor symptoms.

Conclusions

The prevalence and severities of shoulder stiffness, considered a characteristic symptom in Japanese women, were high. Increased BMI was shown to be associated with a higher severity of vasomotor symptoms, joint pain, nervousness, and urinary symptoms.

### Research trends on acupuncture for shoulder pain treatment over the past 15 years: a bibliometric analysis [^03d86867]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Shoulder pain is pain and impaired movement in the shoulder area, often due to muscle strain, external impingement and wear and tear of the joint capsule. The prevalence of shoulder pain in the general population increases with age, ranging from 7% to 30% and the prevalence is higher in women than in men. A literature investigating the severity and impact on quality of life of various types of pain indicated that shoulder pain has a prevalence of 42% and is the third most common musculoskeletal disorder. Shoulder pain is a condition that causes a lot of physical and mental damage to the patient and has seriously affected people's quality of life.

Commonly used treatments for shoulder pain include oral anti-inflammatory drugs, physiotherapy, exercise therapy, drug injections and surgical treatment. However, a growing body of literature indicates that surgical interventions do not yield better results than exercise therapy or physiotherapy. Similarly, long-term use of hormonal drugs can cause side effects for patients. Modern research has shown that acupuncture has significant advantages for pain relief. Acupuncture not only provides an analgesic effect in the short term, but also addresses some of the causes of pain in the long term. It relieves pain, regulates blood circulation, boosts immunity and improves joint range of motion. Acupuncture also has the advantages of low risk, few side effects, ease of handling, and low cost, making the use of acupuncture as a complementary and alternative therapy for shoulder pain widely used in clinical practice. However, despite the popularity of acupuncture in the clinical and research fields, no articles have yet analyzed this content using a bibliometric approach.

### Potential effect modifiers of the association between physical activity patterns and joint symptoms in middle-aged women [^0a4abf3f]. Arthritis Care & Research (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Examination of PA patterns over 12 years in middle‐aged women showed that consistently throughout middle age at least low levels of PA are required to benefit from its protective effects on joint symptoms. The protective effect of PA on joint symptoms seemed stronger in obese women than in underweight/normal weight or overweight women, and this effect appears unrelated to menopause status and HT use.

To our knowledge, no other studies have examined the association between patterns of PA over time and joint symptoms in this age group. The finding that being physically active is associated with lower odds of joint symptoms is consistent with previous findings from the same cohort 4, 38. As there were no significant differences between the low or meeting guidelines and the meeting guidelines at all times groups (Table 2), it seems that doing at least low levels of PA consistently at each time point is sufficient for protective effects on joint symptoms. The current results further suggest that the low levels of PA need to be sustained over time to be beneficial.

Although the relationship between high BMI and increased risk of joint symptoms is well established 39, 40, our findings shed new light on the potential modifying role of BMI on the association between PA and joint symptoms in middle‐aged women. Contrary to previous studies, which found no evidence of effect modification by BMI in the association between PA and OA 33, 35, 41, we found stronger associations between PA and joint symptoms in the obese group than in the underweight/normal‐weight group. Previous studies may have been underpowered, however, to detect significant associations within each of the strata, because stratification led to small numbers of events in each category. This finding is particularly of importance, as it counters the concern that PA may increase the risk of joint symptoms in obese people due to joint loading.

Studies were included if they reported the relationship between structural abnormality on imaging and symptoms (cross‐sectional) or progression/persistence of symptoms (longitudinal). Structures included RC tear, tendinopathy, subacromial bursitis, subacromial space, and acromion. Outcome measures included pain or function measures. Imaging modalities included radiographs, ultrasound, computed tomography, MRI, and positron emission tomography (PET). Exclusion criteria were postsurgical patients, systemic inflammatory conditions (such as polymyalgia rheumatica), neurologic disease, chronic pain syndrome, fibromyalgia, and nonhuman studies. There was no language restriction.

Data extraction

The citations identified by a preliminary search were screened by 2 reviewers (GT and PC) and for references not identified by the preliminary search. Discordance in opinion was resolved by a third reviewer (SRK). Data extraction was performed by 2 reviewers (GT and PC). Articles meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria were divided into longitudinal and cross‐sectional articles and were evaluated for their relationship to shoulder symptoms and whether single or multiple pathologies were assessed. Extracted data were inclusion criteria and population, patient number/controls, patient demographics (age, sex, and body mass index), study design, aims, imaging feature, symptoms, whether pathology was defined, results with or without adjustment for confounders, and findings.

2.2. Measurements

During each annual visit, the presence and severity of musculoskeletal symptoms, such as muscle and joint pain, neck pain, back pain, and knee pain, were individually assessed using a questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of specific questions that inquired about the occurrence of symptoms in the past 2 weeks. Participants were asked "Have you experienced muscle and joint pain in the past 2 weeks? (0 = No, 1 = Yes)", "Have you experienced neck pain in the past 2 weeks? (0 = No, 1 = Yes)", "Have you experienced back pain in the past 2 weeks? (0 = No, 1 = Yes)", and "Have you experienced knee pain in the past 2 weeks? (0 = No, 1 = Yes)". In addition, the questionnaire was used to gauge the frequency and intensity of these symptoms using the following scale: "How often and how much did you experience muscle and joint pain in the past 2 weeks? (No = Never, Mild = Once in a while, Moderate = Frequent but can endure, Severe = Frequent and unbearable)", "How often and how much did you experience neck pain in the past 2 weeks? (No = Never, Mild = Once in a while, Moderate = Frequent but can endure, Severe = Frequent and unbearable)", "How often and how much did you experience back pain in the past 2 weeks? (No = Never, Mild = Once in a while, Moderate = Frequent but can endure, Severe = Frequent and unbearable)", and "How often and how much did you experience knee pain in the past 2 weeks? (No = Never, Mild = Once in a while, Moderate = Frequent but can endure, Severe = Frequent and unbearable)". For additional details on the questionnaire, please refer to Supplementary Table 1. For each question, answering "No" indicated none of the specific symptom, otherwise indicated the presence of the specific symptom.

### Musculoskeletal pain among Chinese women during the menopausal transition: findings from a longitudinal cohort study [^430752ea]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study showed a definite association between BMI and the presence of musculoskeletal pain. It is well acknowledged that weight gain is one of the main complaints of women at midlife, and the prevalence of obesity increased during menopause. A previous study demonstrated that obesity is a risk factor for osteoarthritis and pain, especially in the knee joint; consequently, obesity is also a common complication of knee osteoarthritis. A higher BMI was related to an increased prevalence of knee pain, joint stiffness and hand joint swelling. Considering that BMI does not reflect body composition (the ratio of fat to muscle), other studies have suggested that sarcopenic obesity was responsible for osteoarthritis and pain. Obesity-induced inflammation is a possible pathophysiological mechanism that causes osteoarthritis. However, we did not find any specific association between BMI and the severity of musculoskeletal pain in our research.

In a previous study of PALM, the prevalence of depression and anxiety was found to be 14.5%/3.1% in premenopausal women, 18.2%/7.0% in women in the menopausal transition, and 19.6%/7.4% in postmenopausal women, respectively. Women with anxiety and depression had a higher risk of sleep disturbance during and after menopause. In the present study, the presence of anxiety and depression were found to be positively associated with almost all 4 types of pain. Depression and anxiety exhibit distinct characteristics. Depression manifested as feelings of hopelessness, inferiority, distress, avoidance, and pessimism and is accompanied by somatization symptoms such as chest discomfort and dyspnea. However, anxiety is characterized by panic, agitation, restlessness, and somatization symptoms such as muscle tension and hypersensitivity. The presence of depression and anxiety may heighten the sensitivity of women to musculoskeletal pain, as well as other menopausal symptoms, which may explain the high prevalence of co-occurrence of chronic pain and anxiety/depression symptoms.

Setting and participants

After approvals by the institutional review board of Columbia University and the Community Engagement Research Center of the Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, participants were drawn from an active volunteer community of women residing immediately surrounding our medical center where according to zip code demographics, the majority of residents are medically underserved, are largely Latino (71%), recent immigrants (51%), and primarily from the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. Participants were recruited through flyers and mailings distributed to the Community Engagement Research Center core's registry of community volunteers. Flyers were placed in buildings throughout the Columbia Medical Center as well as affiliated clinics, and schools (ie, school of medicine, nursing, dentistry).

Women between the ages of 45 and 60 years were eligible for inclusion if they: 1) self-identified as Hispanic/Latina; 2) were peri- or early postmenopausal based on reported menstrual irregularity or last menstrual period 3 months to 5 years ago; 3) were experiencing new-onset or worsening musculoskeletal pain/stiffness of the neck, shoulder, fingers, back, hips, knees, or ankles; 4) were not taking hormone therapy or birth control pills; 5) able to read and speak conversational English; and 6) willing to speak about health issues with a group of other research volunteers with a similar background. We included women who were early postmenopausal due to documented data in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) showing menopause symptoms can extend to 5-year from last menstrual period (LMP). Women were excluded if currently suffering from other conditions such as cancer or recent physical injury, which could impact the course of pain or pain management. Women were also excluded if they reported other comorbid conditions with potential effects on pain (eg, diabetes, depression), or used antidepressants in the last 6 months.

Interested participants contacted the study team by telephone or email to assess eligibility and review the study protocol. Eligible participants were invited to a focus group session in an accessible conference room at the Community Partnership for Health, a resource of Columbia University's Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research. Written informed consent was obtained by the moderator before the focus group discussion.

### Pain quality descriptors and sex-related differences in patients with shoulder pain [^6d4efca3]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pain is an individualized, subjective, and multidimensional experience that relies considerably on communication. Studies on words that patients use to describe chronic pain have indicated that pain quality descriptors are the most frequently used.–Therefore, pain quality descriptors are crucial in describing pain.

Implications of pain quality descriptors have received increasing attention. These descriptors have helped clinicians discriminate chronic pain conditions, pain mechanisms, and pain sensationsand identify responses to treatments. These results suggest that pain quality assessment is applicable to pain evaluation and treatment.

Pain quality descriptors of lower back pain, and arthritis-related pain, have been studied. Although shoulder pain is a common musculoskeletal pain condition, shoulder pain quality descriptors mostly remain unknown. Because pain has multiple and distinct qualities, a variation in pain perception can be reasonably assumed among patients with different musculoskeletal diseases. Therefore, back pain and arthritic pain quality descriptors reported in previous studies cannot be generalized to shoulder pain. Furthermore, although musculoskeletal pain is traditionally considered nociceptive, several studies have suggested shared mechanisms of neuropathic pain in people with osteoarthritis and shoulder pain. Because pain quality descriptors have the potential to facilitate discrimination of pain mechanisms, exclusively assessing shoulder pain quality facilitates understanding nociceptive contributions and neuropathic pain components in overall shoulder pain. A mechanism-based classification of shoulder pain benefits shoulder pain management.

The language used to describe pain may vary among men and women because they may have learned different words from earlier pain experiences for describing pain, and studies have shown that sex-related differences considerably affect clinical pain experience. However, few studies have examined sex-related differences in pain language, particularly in the sensory quality of pain. A study in Australia showed that female university students used more words and more McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) descriptors and focused more on pain quality than male students did to describe their pain experiences. By contrast, Robinson et alfound no sex-related differences in sensory subscale scores of the MPQ among patients with back and facial pain, indicating similar pain quality among men and women. Hence, no conclusive sex-related difference regarding pain quality descriptors was observed.

Investigating sex-related differences in pain quality descriptors has clinical and research implications. Providing healthcare professionals with the knowledge of sex-specific pain terminologies can facilitate clinical communication with patients for pain-related assessment and treatment planning. Moreover, if sex-related differences exist, researchers should consider the differences during development of a pain quality assessment tool and the rating principles for clinical and research use.

### Is there an association between breast cancer and incident adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder? A retrospective cohort study from Germany [^af8d55ec]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Preliminary data suggest that women with breast cancer are at particularly high risk of adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the potential association between breast cancer and adhesive capsulitis in adults from Germany.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study included all women aged ≥ 18 years who were diagnosed for the first time with breast cancer in one of 1,274 general practices in Germany between January 2000 and December 2018 (index date). Women without breast cancer were matched (1:1) to those with breast cancer using a propensity score based on age at the index date, index year, and the average number of medical consultations per year during the follow-up. In women without breast cancer, the index date was a randomly selected visit date between 2000 and 2018. The association between breast cancer and the 10-year incidence of adhesive capsulitis was studied using Kaplan-Meier curves and a Cox regression model adjusted for age and several comorbidities.

Results

There were 52,524 women included in this study (mean [SD] age 64.2 [12.9] years). The 10-year incidence of adhesive capsulitis was 3.6% in both the group with and the group without breast cancer (log-rank p-value = 0.317). The Cox regression analysis further showed no significant association between breast cancer and adhesive capsulitis (HR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.86–1.08).

Conclusion

In this sample of women from Germany, breast cancer was not significantly associated with adhesive capsulitis. Although the present preliminary findings are reassuring, general practitioners should regularly assess shoulder function in breast cancer survivors.

### Shorter reproductive time span and early menopause increase the risk of ACPA-negative inflammatory arthritis in postmenopausal women with clinically suspect arthralgia [^3d904340]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Oestrogen levels in women vary over time and oestrogen-related life events, such as the menopause, can influence the risk and course of different auto-inflammatory rheumatic diseases. Around menopause, oestrogen levels drop significantly. The age around which menopause occurs is in the same range as the age at which rheumatoid arthritis (RA) manifests with clinically apparent inflammatory arthritis (median ∼55 years of age). Because of this, the hormonal changes during menopause are hypothesized to contribute to the pathophysiology of RA development.

This assumption is indeed supported by findings from case-control studies that showed a higher frequency of RA in women with early menopause (≤ 45 years) vs normal or late menopause. Similar findings were reported in two population-based prospective studies. One of these two studies investigated the association of postmenopausal status and early menopause with the development of ACPA-positive and ACPA-negative RA separately and suggested that menopause especially conferred the risk for ACPA-negative RA. This is interesting, because ACPA-positive and ACPA-negative RA are disease subsets with different risk factors and disease outcomes. Also, pathophysiological differences have been reported for ACPA-negative and ACPA-positive RA. Thus, if menopausal factors impact RA development, this could be different for ACPA-positive and ACPA-negative disease.

### Pain quality descriptors and sex-related differences in patients with shoulder pain [^974ad9e2]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Various pain qualities are associated with different underlying pain mechanisms. Deep pains (eg, sore, pulled, and torsion), which are relatively predominant in nociceptive pain, are commonly used as shoulder pain descriptors. Although shoulder pain is traditionally considered nociceptive, 30% and 13% of our patients described their shoulder pain as "prick" and "numb", respectively. Combined with other neuropathic pain-like descriptors (eg, burning and itchy), such pain qualities suggest a shared mechanism with neuropathic pain. A recent systemic review concluded that hypersensitivity of the central nervous system contributed to shoulder pain in a subgroup within the shoulder pain population. Thus, with increased awareness of central sensitization in shoulder pain, implementation of accessible and cost-effective pain quality assessment may be warranted.

Consistent with our hypothesis, sex-related differences were evident in the number and frequency of shoulder pain descriptors, whereas the demographic and clinical characteristics (eg, education level, diagnosis, pain duration, and intensity) were comparable between male and female patients. The findings were similar to those of the study conducted in Australia. However, Robinson et alfound no sex-related differences in pain quality among patients with back and facial pain. The discrepancy between Robinson et al's study and the current study may be attributable to the differences in patient sampling and testing methods (questionnaire usage). Nevertheless, our findings support sex-related differences in clinical pain experiences, specifically regarding shoulder pain quality, in addition to prevalence of pain in the shoulder.

### Shorter reproductive time span and early menopause increase the risk of ACPA-negative inflammatory arthritis in postmenopausal women with clinically suspect arthralgia [^1df226af]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

There are several limitations to our study. Firstly, we used the number of reproductive years and ovulatory years as proxies for the duration of oestrogen exposure. These are indirect measures and ideally more information on oestrogen exposure would have been included, such as the number of years on oestrogen-containing drugs (e.g. oral contraceptives or hormonal replacement therapies). Information on the use of hormonal replacement therapies during menopause would have been especially valuable. Hormonal replacement therapy occurs frequently and has been reported to be protective for RA development. Thus, the use of exogenous oestrogens could have interfered with our results. Unfortunately, this information was not available in our cohorts.

Secondly, menopausal factors were based on questionnaires, which could have led to recall bias. The definition of early menopause was based on the question concerning the age at menopause. Women may have had various thoughts about their age at menopause. They might not have referred to the age one year after their last menstruation, but to the age at their last menstruation or even to the age at which they first experienced symptoms related to menopause. Future studies on menopausal factors would preferably include more detailed questionnaires. Moreover, our analysis included a relatively small number of patients, as only women — and for the second aim only postmenopausal women — could be used from the CSA cohorts. Therefore, we were not able to add more adjustment variables to our analyses due to a lack of power. To exclude the possible confounding effect of age, we showed that age was not associated with IA development in pre- and postmenopausal women separately or in men.

### Musculoskeletal pain among Chinese women during the menopausal transition: findings from a longitudinal cohort study [^7ad56d71]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

3. Results

3.1. Baseline characteristics of participants

The baseline characteristics of the study participants were presented in Table 1. Among the 609 participants, the average age at baseline was 48.4 ± 7.31 years. According to the STRAW +10 criteria, 260 (42.7%) women were premenopausal, 98 (16.1%) were in the menopausal transition, and 251 (41.2%) were postmenopausal. The average age of menarche was 13.9 ± 1.51 years. The average BMI of middle-aged women was 25.0 ± 3.29 kg/m 2, which is considered overweight in Chinese standards. Notably, women in the menopausal transition and postmenopausal phases had higher BMIs than premenopausal women did. As menopausal status progressed, FSH levels gradually increased, with a sharp increase observed from the menopausal transition to the postmenopausal phase. In contrast, the level of E2 remained relatively stable from the premenopausal phase to the menopausal transition, and then sharply decreased from the menopausal transition to the postmenopausal phase. In addition, postmenopausal women were less likely to report having excellent health status. More than half (56.16%) of the participants complained of muscle and joint pain. The prevalence of muscle and joint pain was 43.85% in premenopausal women, 64.29% in menopausal transition women, and 65.74% in postmenopausal women. A total of 58.95% of participants reported symptom of neck pain, 57.31%, 68.37%, and 56.97% of whom were premenopausal, in the menopausal transition, and postmenopausal, respectively. Moreover, 68.31% of participants reported symptom of back pain, 65.38%, 70.41%, and 70.52% of whom were premenopausal, in the menopausal transition, and postmenopausal, respectively. More than half of the women reported symptom of knee pain, 40.00%, 54.08%, and 63.75% of whom were premenopausal, in the menopausal transition and postmenopausal, respectively. Less than one-third of women reported no or one type of musculoskeletal pain, approximately one-fifth of participants complained of 2 or 3 types of musculoskeletal pain, and 29.56% of participants complained of all 4 types of musculoskeletal pain. In total, participants tended to report multiple types of pain during the menopausal transition. Furthermore, baseline characteristics based on 5 STRAW +10 stages were shown in Supplementary Table 2.

### Musculoskeletal pain among Chinese women during the menopausal transition: findings from a longitudinal cohort study [^9ea09668]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

The results of this study are derived from cohort data obtained through surveys conducted in a community in Beijing, China. The population under study exhibited minimal racial differences. The use of a concise pain symptom questionnaire facilitated ease of use and data collection. However, cigarette and alcohol use were known to influence E2 levels but was not collected in our original study design. In addition, less than 1% (30/4001 observations) of participants in our cohort reported the use of NSAIDS or Ca preparation (recalling bias may be one of the reasons), which may influence pain scores or bone metabolism. The small sample did not allow us to analyze the influence of these medications on pain symptoms. It is important to acknowledge that accurate quantification of symptom severity was lacking. Although our study could not establish a causal relationship, these findings suggest a potential avenue for further investigation into pain experienced during middle age. Menopausal syndrome encompasses a range of symptoms, some of which can be attributed to menopause, whereas others may be associated with aging or other physical and psychosocial factors. Therefore, it is important not to overlook the improvement in overall health conditions. In addition, it is important to note that our data were collected through annual follow-up, which may not allow us to detect short-term changes and could contribute to recall bias.

In summary, symptoms of musculoskeletal pain are common somatic symptoms in middle-aged women. A majority of women in the postmenopausal stage still suffer from various types of pain. Women with poor health status, higher BMI, and anxiety or depression had a greater risk of different types of pain. Screening for anxious and depressive symptoms during the menopausal transition should be considered throughout menopause. The severity of pain exacerbated over time. These findings can contribute to a deeper understanding of musculoskeletal pain during menopausal stages, thereby aiding in the development of comprehensive management approaches for menopause.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^63bcc4c3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause and symptom outcomes — systemic estrogen administration effectively treats VVA and improves symptoms of overactive bladder and recurrent urinary tract infections, and with lower doses of systemic menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) vaginal symptoms may persist and local therapy may be needed. Large placebo-controlled trials reported significantly fewer sleep disturbances with MHT use, but additional data are required for definitive conclusions. During the menopause transition, anxiety symptoms increase and are associated with an increased likelihood of a major depressive disorder; estrogen therapy (ET) may improve mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms during or shortly after the menopause transition, whereas antidepressant therapy remains appropriate treatment for major depression. Arthralgia outcomes indicate that joint pain or stiffness and general aches or pains were improved in women receiving estrogen–progestogen therapy (EPT), and joint pain increased slightly after discontinuation of treatment.

### Typical and atypical symptoms of acute coronary syndrome: time to retire the terms? [^d35fe747]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Symptoms are the trigger that propel individuals with symptoms suspicious of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) to seek emergent care for this potentially life‐threatening condition. After 3 decades of research on sex differences in the symptoms of ACS, ample evidence suggests that although sex differences in symptoms exist, they are modest and do not contribute significantly to risk stratification or provide a rationale for diagnostic testing based on sex. In a large prospective study, we found that only 3 of 13 common symptoms were predictive of a diagnosis of ACS versus non‐ACS. The predictive value of shoulder pain (odds ratio: 2.53 [95% CI, 1.29–4.96] versus 1.11 [95% CI, 0.67–1.85]) and arm pain (odds ratio: 2.15 [95% CI, 1.10–4.20] versus 1.21 [95% CI, 0.74–1.99]) for women were nearly twice that of men. Shortness of breath was predictive of a non‐ACS diagnosis for men only. 1

Scores of authors have found some sex differences in symptoms of ACS, 2, 3 but small differences were usually based on frequency and distribution of symptoms, not the type of symptom. In many studies, statistical significance was reached when sex differences were as small as a few percentage points. Kahn et al 4 found, for example, that men reported chest pain more frequently than women (86.3% versus 81%; P = 0.03). We must distinguish between clinical significance (whether the magnitude of difference is large enough to change clinical care) and statistical significance (which is subject to variability in sampling and measurement) in assessing patients for further intervention. A more critical issue than sex differences in symptoms is likely the magnitude of symptom overlap in individuals ruled in and out for ACS. Approximately 10% to 15% of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with symptoms suggestive of ACS are actually experiencing ACS, 5, 6 yet the other 85% of patients look so similar that the same diagnostic testing and resources are required to safely rule them out for ACS. Numerous clinical‐decision aids to assess risk for ACS in the ED have been validated over the years, some with 100% sensitivity. 5 Many of these clinical‐decision or prediction rules have facilitated transfer of low‐risk patients to a chest‐pain or clinical‐decision unit or early discharge from the ED. 7

### Menopause and rheumatic disease [^a98c5841]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Menopause occurs naturally in women at about 50 years of age. There is a wealth of data concerning the relationship of menopause to systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoarthritis; there are limited data concerning other rheumatic diseases. Age at menopause may affect the risk and course of rheumatic diseases. Osteoporosis, an integral part of inflammatory rheumatic diseases, is made worse by menopause. Hormone replacement therapy has been studied; its effects vary depending on the disease and even different manifestations within the same disease. Cyclophosphamide can induce early menopause, but there is underlying decreased ovarian reserve in rheumatic diseases.

### A natural S-equol supplement alleviates hot flushes and other menopausal symptoms in equol nonproducing postmenopausal Japanese women [^7914c9a4]. Journal of Women's Health (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this clinical trial was to examine the efficacy of a supplement containing natural S-(-)equol, a daidzein metabolite, in reducing menopausal symptoms.

Methods

In this multicenter, double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 160 equol nonproducing, postmenopausal Japanese women who experienced at least 1 hot flush/day were randomly assigned to consume 10 mg/day S-(-)equol (n = 77 women) or placebo (n = 83 women) for 12 weeks. Participants completed a standardized menopausal symptom checklist and rated five common menopause symptoms by a visual analog scale at baseline, week 12, and week 18 (6-week postintervention). Physical, blood, and urine examinations were conducted. One hundred twenty-six women completed the study.

Results

At baseline, daily hot flush frequency was 2.9 ± 2.1 for the S-(-)equol group and 3.2 ± 2.4 for the placebo group. After the 12-week intervention, the S-(-)equol group had a greater decrease from baseline in hot flush frequency compared with the placebo group (-1.9 ± 1.8/day, -58.7%, vs. -1.0 ± 2.0/day, -34.5%, p = 0.009). The severity of hot flushes and neck or shoulder muscle stiffness significantly decreased in the S-(-)equol group compared with the placebo group. No changes in clinical parameters or serious adverse effects were reported.

Conclusions

This is the first trial to show beneficial effects of a 10-mg natural S-(-)equol supplement consumed daily for 12 weeks on major menopausal symptoms, specifically, hot flushes and neck or shoulder muscle stiffness, in postmenopausal Japanese women. This supplement offers a promising alternative for management of menopausal symptoms.

In April 2004, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Office of Research in Women's Health at the NIH convened a workshop to explore how male and female biologic and physiologic characteristics affect musculoskeletal health. This issue of Orthopedic Clinics of North America picks up where the workshop left off, extending the discussion of clinical topics across the broad spectrum of musculoskeletal health. This article serves as a prelude and introduction to the issue and provides a synopsis of the workshop findings.

### The use and safety of corticosteroid injections for shoulder pain in general practice: a retrospective cohort study [^482bd7f9]. Family Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Comparison with existing literature

Our study found that 26% of the patients with a new episode of shoulder pain received a CSI administered by the GP. This is in line with other studies, which observed percentages ranging from 20% to 24%. The small difference could be explained by the difference in inclusion criteria. Our study only included patients with a new episode of shoulder pain, while other studies also included prevalent cases. Furthermore, our study included all patients with shoulder pain, irrespective of the origin, while other studies only included patients with rotator cuff-related pain.

In 49.8% of the patients who received a CSI, the CSI was given in the first consultation. This is not in line with the recommendation in the guidelines, which states that the GP should start with advice, give information, and prescribe analgesics. However, we found a wide variety of patient and shoulder characteristics presented at the first consultation in general practice, which could explain why GPs decided to deviate from the guideline. Furthermore, as previously mentioned, we did not have any information on over-the-counter medication or other possible treatments before the first consultation with the GP. It could be that patients who had already had other treatments before the first consultation received a more intensive treatment by the GP at the first consultation.

The patient's age and history of shoulder complaints were both positively associated with the administration of a CSI by the GP. This is in line with the findings of other studies. Feleus et al.found that older patients (46–64 years) were more likely to receive a CSI compared to younger patients (18–45 years). A possible explanation for an increase in the likelihood of receiving a CSI with an increase in the patient's age could be because GPs are more reluctant to prescribe NSAIDs or opioids in the elderly population, or they expect better or similar results for younger patients with other, less invasive treatment options (e.g. physical therapy or NSAIDs).

In the 968 patients who received a CSI, no serious adverse reactions were recorded by the GP. Minor side effects that were reported include local skin reactions, hyperglycemia, and abnormal menstruation. These side effects are well known and have been described in previous studies on the adverse reactions of CSIs. However, a more recent review points out the possible adverse impact of CSIs on rotator cuff tendon health.

### The association of hormone replacement therapy with experimental pain responses in postmenopausal women [^3d206bd8]. Pain (2001). Low credibility.

Considerable experimental research suggests that ovarian hormones can influence pain perception, and recent epidemiologic and clinical research suggests that exogenous hormone use may influence the prevalence and severity of clinical pain among women. However, to date no studies have examined the influence of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on experimental pain responses and recent pain complaints among postmenopausal women. In this study, self-reported recent pain and general health were obtained, and thermal pain responses were assessed in three groups of healthy older adults: (1) women on HRT, (2) women not on HRT (No-HRT), and (3) men. Results indicated no group differences in recent pain complaints or self-reported health, but differences emerged for measures of thermal pain perception. Specifically, HRT women showed lower pain thresholds and tolerances than No-HRT women and men, and the latter two groups did not differ from each other. The potential explanations and limitations of the observed findings are discussed.

### Potential effect modifiers of the association between physical activity patterns and joint symptoms in middle-aged women [^5a2c1e9b]. Arthritis Care & Research (2018). Low credibility.

Strengths of this study include the large sample size and repeated measurements, which allowed for examination of PA patterns, BMI, menopausal status, HT use, and joint symptoms over time. However, due to the high prevalence of joint symptoms at the start of the followup (survey 2) there were relatively few cases with incident joint symptoms. This resulted in limited power to detect statistically significant associations with incident joint symptoms, particularly in the stratified analyses. A limitation of the study is that all measures, including the outcome, are based on self‐report. The outcome is a crude measure of frequency of any joint pain and stiffness perceived in the past 12 months. Information about which joints were affected or severity is not available. The strength of the association between PA and joint symptoms may vary by type of symptom (e.g. pain, swelling, stiffness), by joint, or by severity. The outcome may have included non‐arthritis‐related joint symptoms. We chose to examine joint symptoms rather than using a formal OA diagnosis, as many women in this age range may not have been diagnosed formally, using, for example, medical imaging. Previous research in this sample showed that fluctuations in joint symptoms coincided with within‐person variation in the self‐report of OA 23. Two definitions of joint symptoms were used: prevalent joint symptoms (reflecting the presence of symptoms at the end of the followup, irrespective of symptoms perceived during followup), and cumulative incident joint symptoms (reflecting the presence of joint symptoms during followup after the exclusion of those reporting symptoms at the start of the followup). With either definition, reverse causation cannot be fully ruled out, as participants may have developed joint symptoms during followup and subsequently altered their PA. We considered using a "pure" incident measure of joint symptoms, reflecting newly reported symptoms at the end of followup (survey 6) and excluding participants who reported joint symptoms during followup (surveys 2–5), so that the outcome followed the exposure. However, this resulted in the exclusion of a large proportion of the inactive participants, as they were more likely to develop symptoms at earlier ages. This then led to skewed results due to a healthy survivor bias. Self‐report of PA may have led to misclassification due to under‐ or overreporting. However, the survey used has been found to have acceptable validity when compared with accelerometry (correlation = 0.52) 24. In addition, the definitions of PA patterns used were driven by statistical criteria more than clinically relevant criteria. Various definitions of patterns were explored, but resulted in too many categories with small numbers of participants, as at each survey 37–45% of participants changed from the previous survey in the level of PA they reported (with 76% of participants changing at any survey interval). For example, consideration was given to splitting up the fluctuating group into separate "increasing" and "decreasing" patterns. However, variation within those categories regarding the timing and amount of increase and decrease, and the small numbers of participants in each of the categories, limited meaningful analyses of this classification. The effect modifiers BMI, menopausal status, and HT use were measured in 1998 only, and people may have changed categories during followup. This may have reduced the contrast between categories. Conversely, creating additional categories reflecting transitions between categories over time would have resulted in more categories with small numbers of participants. The analyses were adjusted for important confounders; however, residual confounding cannot be ruled out. Finally, the original sample was representative of Australian women aged 45–50 years, but with a somewhat higher representation of partnered women and women with education beyond the high school level 22. Comparison of women included in the analyses and those excluded due to missing values on the confounders did not show any differences in sociodemographic and health variables. Moreover, sensitivity analyses after imputing missing values on confounders did not alter the interpretation of the findings. However, most participants were excluded due to missing values on joint symptoms and PA. Compared with participants with any missing data, including PA and joint symptoms, those included in the analyses were in better socioeconomic positions, were healthier, and had healthier lifestyles. Hence, the current findings represent a somewhat more affluent and healthier population.

### Shorter reproductive time span and early menopause increase the risk of ACPA-negative inflammatory arthritis in postmenopausal women with clinically suspect arthralgia [^ccce6618]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Several aspects regarding this topic, however, are still unclear. The number of longitudinal studies on menopausal factors in the pre-RA period is scarce and the timing of their effect is unknown. The hormonal factors can be associated with the development or the maturation of the autoimmune response, which largely occurs in the asymptomatic at-risk stage: the stage before the onset of symptoms in which ACPAs can appear and mature. Alternatively, they can exert their effect in the symptomatic at-risk stage and influence the progression from arthralgia to clinically apparent inflammatory arthritis. Furthermore, it remains to be unravelled whether this risk is determined by postmenopausal status or by the effect of lifetime (cumulative) oestrogen exposure. Two recent population-based studies suggested that a shorter number of reproductive years and lower cumulative oestrogen exposure provide a higher risk for RA. To increase the comprehension of the role of menopause-related factors in the pathophysiology of RA, we concentrated on the symptomatic at-risk stage and performed a longitudinal study in two arthralgia cohorts. We studied whether postmenopausal status and factors related to shorter lifetime oestrogen exposure among postmenopausal women are associated with the risk of developing clinically apparent inflammatory arthritis (IA) and RA, and whether this differs for the development of ACPA-positive or ACPA-negative disease.

### Pain quality descriptors and sex-related differences in patients with shoulder pain [^04a96631]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

The current study discovered 15 common shoulder pain quality descriptors and identified different patterns or profiles of shoulder pain quality between male and female participants. The findings contribute to the growing research on various experiences of pain quality from a patient's perspective. Because sex-related differences were observed in pain quality but not in pain intensity, our findings suggest that the scores based on global pain intensity may fail to reflect the diversity of pain manifestations and the complexity of underlying biological mechanisms in men and women.

Shoulder pain was found to have a diverse pain quality (Table 2), comprising deep and superficial pain characteristics. Deep pain entails traction (eg, pulled and torsion), dullness (eg, sore, dull, faint, or slight), and constriction (eg, taut and squeezing) sensations, whereas superficial pain comprises puncturing or abrasive (eg, pricking), incisive (eg, lacerating), and numbness sensations. The presence of deep and superficial pain sensations (eg, dull, pressing, and pricking) suggests that shoulder pain is conducted through Aδ and C nerve fibers, the major pain-conducting nerve fibers.

In addition to deep and superficial pain sensations, we found that paroxysmal pain sensations (eg, shooting)were frequently (> 30%) noted in patients with shoulder pain; by contrast, "hot" and "cold" were rarely used (< 5%). Similar findings were observed in a recent study on pain quality response profiles of treatment for shoulder impingement syndrome, which showed high intensities of deep (eg, dull and achy) or paroxysmal (eg, sharp and shooting) pain quality and relatively minor "hot" or "cold" pain at the baseline. The descriptor "cold" appears to be seldom used to describe musculoskeletal pain. Studies on lower back and knee pain have also found that the descriptor "cold" was rarely used. Combining the 15 common shoulder pain quality descriptors facilitates the study of shoulder pain of different etiologies.

### Musculoskeletal pain among Chinese women during the menopausal transition: findings from a longitudinal cohort study [^355a4230]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

For the analysis of the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms, each participant was required to have completed a minimum of 2 symptom assessments during their annual follow-up visits. Of the 1157 participants (2005–2022), 223 women were excluded because the Straw +10 Staging System was not applicable, and 262 women were excluded because STRAW +10 stages were missing. We further excluded 63 women with only one symptom assessment. Therefore, the final analytic sample included 609 women, for a total of 4001 observations (Fig. 1). On average, each woman contributed 6 observations to the study, with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 10. There were 669 observations of the premenopausal stage (stage −3), 1213 observations of the menopausal transition (675 from stage −2 and 538 from stage −1), and 2119 observations of the postmenopausal stage (1267 from stage +1 and 852 from stage +2).

To evaluate the influence of age of FMP on the prevalence and severity of musculoskeletal pain, we conducted a subgroup analysis of women who had a documented date of FMP, experiencing a natural menopausal transition without hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy. Therefore, a subcohort of 418 women with 2735 observations from 10 years before to 29 years after the FMP was included in the subgroup analysis. We reanalyzed the data to test the consistency of our main results.

### Hormone replacement therapy (conjugated oestrogens plus bazedoxifene) for post-menopausal women with symptomatic hand osteoarthritis: primary report from the HOPE-e randomised, placebo-controlled, feasibility study [^b0dfbd18]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

Implications of all the available evidence

Post-menopausal women with symptomatic hand osteoarthritis might represent an important disease subtype. There is evidence that painful musculoskeletal conditions might start or get worse around the time of menopause or cessation of HRT — the high interest and enquiries for this study support this conclusion, which should be considered when taking a history of either a painful musculoskeletal condition or symptoms of menopause. Our study does not provide evidence for effect but does support the need to understand whether there might be sex-specific treatments or treatment considerations for people with rheumatic diseases. It also reinforces the importance of understanding the mechanisms by which oestrogen deficiency or other sex hormone changes might contribute to the risk of illness or disease.

There is an ongoing unmet need for effective drug therapy for pain or disease modification in patients with hand osteoarthritis: a series of clinical trials failed to show efficacy in repurposing a range of anti-rheumatic drugs for people with hand osteoarthritis, suggesting that novel approaches are needed that account for disease-specific mechanisms. There is a recognition, as in other areas of rheumatology, that clinically relevant subgroups of hand osteoarthritis are likely to exist and that stratification might help to identify effective interventions. Therefore, the question of whether treating oestrogen deficiency with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) could improve or prevent osteoarthritis symptoms or structural joint changes in humans is relevant.

In a trial run as part of the Women's Health Initiative, people receiving unconjugated oestrogens had lower rates of hip and knee arthroplasty and less all-cause musculoskeletal pain than those receiving placebo in post-hoc studies. More recently, both small and large UK health record datasets have suggested that the use of HRT might influence the onset of symptoms of hand osteoarthritis. However, no causal associations can be inferred from these studies and there are inherent biases related to the reasons women might seek HRT (50% of menopausal women have related musculoskeletal symptoms). Selective oestrogen receptor modulators (a newer class of HRT drug) have been shown in pre-clinical models to have beneficial effects on articular cartilage and have been associated with improvements in musculoskeletal pain. A first-in-class combination of a selective oestrogen receptor modulator and unconjugated oestrogens is licensed for use for menopausal symptoms. Currently, the use of HRTs for a primary indication of musculoskeletal symptoms is outside of the license for these therapies.

### Symptoms of menopause-global prevalence, physiology and implications [^baae967e]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

The symptoms of menopause can be distressing, particularly as they occur at a time when women have important roles in society, within the family and at the workplace. Hormonal changes that begin during the menopausal transition affect many biological systems. Accordingly, the signs and symptoms of menopause include central nervous system-related disorders; metabolic, weight, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal changes; urogenital and skin atrophy; and sexual dysfunction. The physiological basis of these manifestations is emerging as complex and related, but not limited to, oestrogen deprivation. Findings generated mainly from longitudinal population studies have shown that ethnic, geographical and individual factors affect symptom prevalence and severity. Moreover, and of great importance to clinical practice, the latest research has highlighted how certain menopausal symptoms can be associated with the onset of other disorders and might therefore serve as predictors of future health risks in postmenopausal women. The goal of this Review is to describe in a timely manner new research findings on the global prevalence and physiology of menopausal symptoms and their impact on future health.

### Sensitivity, specificity, and sex differences in symptoms reported on the 13-item acute coronary syndrome checklist [^f38604e1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

There were more similarities than differences in symptom predictors of ACS for women and men. Women were twice as likely to report arm and shoulder pain, compared to men. Sex differences in symptoms require further study to help guide patients' treatment seeking decisions. Although sex differences were minimal, shoulder pain and arm pain may be key symptoms that improve clinical prediction of ACS in women. These symptoms may help guide the clinician in deciding the extent of diagnostic workups.

### Menopause affects pain depending on pain type and characteristics [^02ad4ee4]. Menopause (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Women are more affected than men by many chronic pain conditions, suggesting the effect of sex-related mechanisms in their occurrence. The role of gonadal hormones has been studied but with contrasting results depending on the pain syndrome, reproductive status, and hormone considered. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the pain changes related to the menopausal transition period.

Methods

In this observational study, postmenopausal women were asked to evaluate the presence of pain in their life during the premenopausal and postmenopausal periods and its modification with menopause.

Results

One hundred one women were enrolled and completed questionnaires on their sociodemographic status, pain characteristics, and evolution. The most common pain syndromes were headache (38%), osteoarticular pain (31%), and cervical/lumbar pain (21%). Pain was present before menopause in 66 women, ceased with menopause in 17, and started after menopause in 18. Data were used for cluster analysis, which allowed the division of participants into four groups. In the first, all women experienced headaches that disappeared or improved with menopause. The second group included osteoarticular pain; the pain improved in half of these women and remained stable in the other half. The third group had cervical/lumbar pain, which disappeared or improved with menopause in all. The fourth group presented different kinds of moderate pain, which worsened in all.

Conclusions

The present study provides preliminary data suggesting that menopause can affect pain depending on the painful condition experienced by the woman. This underlines the different interactions of menopause-related events with body structures involved in pain.

### Potential effect modifiers of the association between physical activity patterns and joint symptoms in middle-aged women [^5dceda33]. Arthritis Care & Research (2018). Low credibility.

If estrogen has protective effects on joint structures, one would expect beneficial effects to arise from hormone therapy (HT) and detrimental effects following hysterectomy and oophorectomy. Hysterectomy and oophorectomy have been associated with an increased risk of OA 9, 10, 11. Evidence for an association between HT use and OA is inconclusive, however. Some 9, 12, but not all 12, 13, 14, observational studies found that HT use had significant protective associations with (radiographic) OA. In the studies that did not find statistically significant associations, the odds ratios were suggestive of protective associations of HT use, but the studies seemed underpowered to detect these 12, 13, 14. In contrast, other observational studies found that HT use was associated with increased risks of hip and hand, but not knee OA 15 or hip and knee replacement 16. Results from randomized controlled trials suggest that estrogen‐only therapy, but not estrogen plus progestin therapy, may be associated with reduced risks of joint replacement and joint symptoms 17, 18, 19.

In summary, there is a complex interplay between PA, body composition, and menopause and the risk of developing OA. Previous studies have typically examined PA at one point in time with outcomes measured at a later point in time. This approach does not account for the fluctuations in PA behavior over time 20. The aim of this prospective cohort study was to examine whether body composition, menopausal status, and use of HT modify the association between PA patterns throughout middle age and the incidence and prevalence of joint symptoms in later middle age in women.

### Shorter reproductive time span and early menopause increase the risk of ACPA-negative inflammatory arthritis in postmenopausal women with clinically suspect arthralgia [^1a6622af]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

These results add to the understanding of RA development. Based on our findings, the effect of postmenopausal status on the risk of ACPA-negative RA — as demonstrated previously — seems to exert its effect in the symptomatic at-risk phase of RA. Our results do not exclude the possibility of an effect in the pre-symptomatic phase as well. This knowledge about this risk factor and the time at which it may exert its effect is important for the comprehension of the pathophysiology of ACPA-negative RA; also because many known risk factors predominantly confer risk for ACPA-positive disease. For example, smoking mainly contributes to the development of ACPAs and maturation of the ACPA response, while it does not confer risk for RA development in ACPA-positive CSA. The genetic risk factor human leucocyte antigen-shared epitope (HLE-SE) confers risk for progression to RA, but in ACPA-positive patients only. Obesity is also a risk factor for RA, that seemed to act in the asymptomatic risk period and increases the risk for onset of ACPA-positive and ACPA-negative CSA, while it was not associated with progression from CSA to ACPA-positive and ACPA-negative RA. A recent study showed that long-term work-related physical strain is associated with the level of subclinical joint inflammation in ACPA-positive and ACPA-negative CSA and contributes to subsequent RA development. Here, our data additionally identify the hormonal changes around menopause as a risk factor for the development of RA in the symptomatic risk phase of CSA, but for ACPA-negative patients only.

In contrast to ACPA-negative RA, none of the menopausal factors were associated with the development of ACPA-positive RA in the at-risk phase of arthralgia. Postmenopausal status and early menopause have previously been reported to be associated with the development of ACPA-positivity in a prospective study in first-degree relatives. In addition, in our data we noticed that postmenopausal women were more often ACPA-positive than premenopausal women, while this did not translate to a higher risk of RA for postmenopausal women in the total ACPA-positive group. Thus, interestingly, hormonal factors might influence the development of systemic autoimmunity in pre-RA, but not the progression from arthralgia to chronic disease in ACPA-positive patients. Future research in population-based cohorts following asymptomatic patients towards symptom development could elucidate this topic further.

### Musculoskeletal pain among Chinese women during the menopausal transition: findings from a longitudinal cohort study [^da7f783a]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

2.3. Statistical analysis

The prevalence of musculoskeletal pain at different menopausal stages was calculated as the ratio of the number of observations to the total observations at each menopausal stage and is expressed as a percentage.

Continuous variables after a normal distribution were presented as mean ± SD. Categorical variables were presented as n (%). Comparisons of continuous variables among groups were conducted using the Kruskal‒Wallis test followed by the Nemenyi test. Categorical data were compared using the χ 2 test followed by the χ 2 post hoc test.

The study used a generalized estimating equation (GEE) to estimate the impact of menopausal stages on the symptoms of muscle and joint pain, neck pain, back pain, and knee pain in the longitudinal analysis. We analyzed the presence of symptoms of muscle and joint pain, neck pain, back pain, and knee pain, as well as the severity of each symptom as an endpoint of GEE. Thus, a total of 8 models were run. The GEE model considers within-participant correlations by incorporating a working correlation matrix. A random intercept and an exchangeable working correlation matrix were implemented. We assessed the impact of the STRAW +10 stages (with the premenopausal stage [stage −3] as the reference), education, marital status, income, general health status, age, BMI, natural log-transformed values of FSH and E2, BMD in various regions (ie, femoral neck, trunk, spine, pelvis, and total), as well as general stress (ie, anxiety or depression) on musculoskeletal pain through univariable analysis. The STRAW +10 stages were included in the multivariate analysis, regardless of the significance level. Other variables with a significance level of P ≤ 0.1 in the univariate analyses were subsequently included in the multivariate analysis to evaluate their independent effects on the outcomes, and the working correlation structure was specified as exchangeable. In addition, the Wald test was used to determine the significance of the overall test results. The analyses of the presence of musculoskeletal pain were independent from the analyses of the severity of musculoskeletal pain.

The data analyses were conducted using R software (version 4.1.3). All tests were 2-sided, and a significance level of < 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance.

### Genomic characterisation of the overlap of endometriosis with 76 comorbidities identifies pleiotropic and causal mechanisms underlying disease risk [^e1b4da06]. Human Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Using the UKB, we identified 292 ICD10 codes associated with an endometriosis diagnosis. Some of these traits have been previously identified as comorbid with endometriosis in epidemiological studies, including uterine fibroids (Gallagher et al.), infertility (Mahmood and Templeton; Meuleman et al; Petre et al.), menstrual disturbances (Missmer et al; Nnoaham et al; Treloar et al; Wei et al.), multiple pain phenotypes (Signorile et al.), asthma (Peng et al.), irritable bowel syndrome (Chiaffarino et al.), various allergies (Shafrir et al; Yoshii et al.), depression, anxiety (Chen et al; Estes et al; Koller et al.), ischaemic heart disease, hypertension (Okoth et al.), anaemia (Choi et al.), migraine (Yang et al.), and ovarian cancer (Capmas et al; Saavalainen et al.). Whilst many of the identified ICD10 codes relate to traits previously characterised as comorbid with endometriosis, many novel traits were also identified. Interestingly, there were multiple traits related to shoulder pain: shoulder impingement syndrome, rotator cuff syndrome and adhesive capsulitis of shoulder. Diaphragmatic/thoracic endometriosis has been linked to shoulder pain (Ceccaroni et al; Nezhat et al.), although is considered to be a rare condition, affecting 1.5% of individuals with concurrent pelvic endometriosis (Ceccaroni et al.). Diaphragmatic endometriosis has also been linked to pneumothorax (Ceccaroni et al.), which was also associated with endometriosis in the UKB. It is possible that diaphragmatic/thoracic endometriosis-associated shoulder pain may alter shoulder movement, leading to these conditions. Alternatively, their comorbidity could arise due to a confounding factor, ascertainment bias, or misdiagnosis given endometriosis is an unlikely suspect for shoulder pain. Another notable set of traits were those related to infection of female reproductive organs: salpingitis and oophoritis (N70.1, N70.9) and acute vaginitis (N76.0), as well as their inflammation: pelvic inflammatory disease (N73.9), inflammatory disease of uterus (N71.0, N71.9), and inflammatory disease of cervix uteri (N72). Endometriosis development has been hypothesised to be initiated by an innate immune response stimulated by an infection (Khan et al; Kobayashi et al; Koninckx et al.). There are some limitations in interpreting the epidemiologically associated traits. Interaction with healthcare services increases the opportunity to be diagnosed with any condition, irrespective of whether the motivation for seeking healthcare was related to that condition. Given most endometriosis patients will undergo multiple interactions with healthcare services to achieve their endometriosis diagnosis, evidenced through the ICD10 chapter 21 (Factors influencing health status and contact with health services) being the second most common chapter in the UKB epidemiological analysis, they have an increased chance of being diagnosed with conditions that may have otherwise been undetected, which may amplify correlations between conditions. In particular, the gynaecological traits may be especially subject to ascertainment bias, as most individuals with endometriosis will have consulted a gynaecologist. This may explain the enrichment of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) cases in endometriosis comorbidity of PCOS, contradicting claims that they are diametric diseases (Dinsdale et al.) and show inverse comorbidity across populations (Crespi). In fact, 12 of the 34 individuals with both PCOS and endometriosis in the UKB had the same date of diagnosis for endometriosis and PCOS, and 17 had PCOS diagnosed within the same 365-day period. Nevertheless, the relationship remained upon exclusion of these 17 individuals (OR = 2.36, P = 1.22 × 10 −3).

### Estradiol (Elestrin) [^7363beb3]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Generally, when estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, consider addition of a progestin to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer.

Generally, a woman without a uterus does not need to take a progestin in addition to her estrogen therapy. In some cases, however, hysterectomized women who have a history of endometriosis may need a progestin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), (5.14)].

Use estrogen-alone, or in combination with a progestin, at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Reevaluate postmenopausal women periodically as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary.

ELESTRIN is applied onto the skin in a thin layer. The recommended area of application is the upper arm to shoulder (approximately 320 cm2).

Start therapy with daily administration of one pump actuation to deliver 0.87 grams of gel providing 0.52 mg estradiol to the upper arm. Dosage adjustment should be guided by the clinical response (2.1)

2.1 Treatment of Moderate to Severe Vasomotor Symptoms due to Menopause

ELESTRIN is applied once daily to the upper arm for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms due to menopause using a metered-dose pump which delivers 0.87 grams of estradiol gel (0.52 mg estradiol) per actuation (1 pump).

Start therapy with one pump per day (0.87 grams per day, which contains 0.52 mg of estradiol).

Make dosage adjustments based on clinical response.

### Frozen shoulder and risk of cancer: a population-based cohort study [^f315aa83]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Frozen shoulder, also called adhesive capsulitis, is characterised by stiffness and pain in the shoulder joint due to inflammation of the synovial lining and capsule. The aetiology of frozen shoulder is not fully understood. It can develop after a shoulder has been immobilised. An increased incidence of frozen shoulder was observed in diabetes vs non-diabetes patients (1.2 vs 0.9%) and in patients with diseases such as thyroid and Parkinson's disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and myocardial infarction (MI). Frozen shoulder can last for up to 3 years, and resolves spontaneously in most cases.

Frozen shoulder can be a musculoskeletal manifesting of solid tumours and haematological malignancies, and may also represent a misdiagnosed shoulder tumour. In addition, frozen shoulder is a frequent complication after mastectomy due to breast cancer.

Thus, there is some clinical evidence, based on case reports and small cross-sectional studies, that patients with malignancies are at increased risk of frozen shoulder. We examined the association between frozen shoulder diagnosis and subsequent risk of cancer using linked data from Danish population registries.

### Shorter reproductive time span and early menopause increase the risk of ACPA-negative inflammatory arthritis in postmenopausal women with clinically suspect arthralgia [^bc5ba37a]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Patients

In Cohort 1, 79% of patients were female, the overall mean age was 44 years and the median tender joint count 4. These baseline characteristics were comparable to Cohort 2 (Table 1). In Cohort 1, 26% of women were postmenopausal. This was 28% in Cohort 2. Baseline characteristics of the pre-and postmenopausal women from both cohorts can be found in Supplementary Table S2, available at Rheumatology online. Postmenopausal women were older than premenopausal women (57 vs 38 years, P < 0.05) and more often ACPA-positive (29% vs 10%, P < 0.05).

Table 1.
Baseline characteristics of included CSA patients from cohort 1 and cohort 2

In all postmenopausal women from both cohorts (n = 78), the mean number of reproductive years was 36 and the mean number of ovulatory years was 34. Of all postmenopausal women, 23% had an early age at menopause (≤ 45 years).

Postmenopausal status increases risk of ACPA-negative IA

In Cohort 1, the median follow up time was 24 months [interquartile range (IQR) 11–26] and 11% of patients developed IA. The risk of IA was increased for postmenopausal women compared with premenopausal women (22% vs 8% developed IA; HR 2.8, 95%CI 1.2–6.4, Fig. 1, Table 2). In Cohort 2, median follow-up time was 18 months (IQR 8–24) and 18% developed IA. Similarly to Cohort 1, the risk of IA was increased for postmenopausal women compared with premenopausal women (32% vs 13% developed IA; HR 2.6, 95%CI 1.01–6.4, Fig. 1, Table 2).

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Novel pharmacological agents for osteoarthritis that improve joint pain and function are a high research priority. Female sex is a well-established risk factor for symptomatic osteoarthritis, particularly hand osteoarthritis. Hand osteoarthritis is most common in women during the decade associated with menopause, a time of changes in sex hormones. Musculoskeletal symptoms, such as joint pain, are frequently a part of menopause syndrome. However, there are only sparse musculoskeletal data available from large hormone replacement therapy (HRT) trials. The Women's Health Initiative recruited participants with classic menopausal symptoms. Those on unconjugated oestrogens were more protected from large joint replacement and incident musculoskeletal pain than were those on placebo. Before planning this study, we searched PubMed for articles published in English reporting cohort studies, observational or controlled studies, or randomised controlled trials relating to the effects of HRT agents in people with osteoarthritis, using the terms ["osteoarthritis" OR "hand osteoarthritis"] AND ["HRT" OR "Hormone" OR "Hormone Replacement Therapy"] OR ["estrogen" OR "oestrogen" OR "estradiol"] OR ["selective estrogen receptor modulator" OR "SERM"] from inception to Jan 1, 2016. We found no relevant studies or randomised controlled trials, or any reports of feasibility or acceptability assessments of this drug class in people with osteoarthritis. The only relevant article was a meta-analysis by Sniekers and colleagues, which corroborated the protective effect of oestrogen on hip arthroplasty in large trial populations but also noted some risk of bias.

### A genome-wide association study finds genetic variants associated with neck or shoulder pain in UK biobank [^9d4b3902]. Human Molecular Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Musculoskeletal pain in the neck and shoulder areas is a major health problem for adults of working age as well as for elderly populations. Neck and shoulder pain are prevalent forms of self-reported musculoskeletal pain. The etiologies of neck and shoulder pain may be complicated since both regional lesions and systemic disorders outside the cervicobrachial area may cause pain at that location. In addition, lesions in the neck can lead to pain in the shoulder and vice versa. Many people also have difficulty in describing and differentiating pain in these areas accurately. For these reasons, neck or shoulder pain is often discussed as a single entity.

Epidemiological studies have suggested that the prevalence of neck pain is 5–8% and 13% for shoulder pain. The Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 found that of the 291 conditions studied, neck or shoulder pain as a single entity ranked 21st in overall burden on society, and 4th in terms of overall disability. The updated Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 also indicated that neck pain was a top five cause of years lived with disability (YLD) in high-income and high-middle-income countries. Risk factors associated with neck or shoulder pain conform to the biopsychosocial model; specifically, they include older age, being female, high body mass index (BMI), previous injury, strenuous occupation and diabetes mellitus. Although mechanical exposure is associated with increased risk of pain in the neck and shoulder, this explains only part of these complaints. Because of the biopsychosocial factors involved, treating neck or shoulder pain successfully is a challenge. In a study of neck, shoulder and arm pain, only 25% of the patients made a complete recovery after 6 months. This is lower than the 35% recovery rate of patients with low back pain after 12 months. Estimated rates of remission 1 year after neck or shoulder pain onset were between 33 and 55%.

Sample 2: patients with a new episode of shoulder pain receiving a CSI within 12 months after initial diagnosis (n = 1,000)

In the sample of 1,000 patients with a new episode of shoulder pain receiving a CSI within 12 months after initial diagnosis, 32 patients had to be excluded, because the CSI was either not administered or was administered for a different, non-shoulder related, complaint (Fig. 1). Therefore, the PPV for this algorithm was 96.8%. In the final sample (n = 968), 60% were female and the mean age was 58.8 years (SD 13.7). A history of shoulder pain was seen in 37% of the patients, 16% had a diagnosis of osteoarthritis, 13% had diabetes, and only 3% had a diagnosis of a rheumatic disease.

In this sample, 486 patients (50%) received the CSI at the first consultation. In total, 333 patients (34%) received more than 1 CSI during 12 months of follow-up, 258 patients received 2 CSIs, and 75 patients received 3 or more CSIs, one of whom received 6 CSIs (Table 2).

Table 2.
Characteristics of sample 2: patients with a new episode of shoulder pain who received a corticosteroid injection (CSI) within 12 months after the initial shoulder pain diagnosis, and the frequency and timing of the corticosteroid injections (2012–2017).

In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, only the patient's age was positively associated with the likelihood of receiving the CSI at the first consultation (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00–1.02) (Supplementary Table 2) and with the likelihood of receiving more than 1 CSI (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00–1.02) (Supplementary Table 3).

In 43 patients (4%), adverse reactions were recorded by the GP within 3 months after the initial CSI administration. No serious adverse reactions were reported by the GP. The most common side effects were as follows: local skin reaction, hyperglycemia, and abnormal menstruation (Table 3).

### Shorter reproductive time span and early menopause increase the risk of ACPA-negative inflammatory arthritis in postmenopausal women with clinically suspect arthralgia [^fb228bb8]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

A strength of this study was the availability of two independent CSA cohorts, which allowed us to validate our results with respect to the comparison of pre- vs postmenopausal women. In addition, by combining the data from both cohorts, we were able to increase power with a higher number of postmenopausal women for the analyses on lifetime duration of oestrogen exposure. And, most importantly, we were able to show consistent results for different menopausal factors, which provided face-validity and supported the robustness of our data.

In conclusion, by studying two independent cohorts, we showed that postmenopausal status increases the risk of ACPA-negative RA in women with CSA; the risk for ACPA-positive RA was not increased. In addition, a shorter reproductive life span and thus a shorter duration of exposure to high oestrogen levels in women increased the risk of progression to ACPA-negative IA in postmenopausal women. Thus, in the symptomatic at-risk phase of RA, reduced levels of oestrogens might play a role in the development of ACPA-negative disease.

### The intersection of aging and estrogen in osteoarthritis [^55de2099]. Npj Women's Health (2025). Medium credibility.

The link between estrogen and OA

Although other factors are important in OA development, the decline in estrogen levels that occurs during menopause leads to an increased risk of developing OA. Estrogen inhibits inflammation, protects chondrocytes from associated degenerative process, and delays OA. Estrogen also promotes synthesis of proteoglycan and collagen by chondrocytes and the expression of cartilage-specific genes –. Furthermore, pro-inflammatory cytokine expression by cytokines is attenuated by hormone replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy is the gold standard for treating menopausal symptoms. Epidemiologic studies of estrogen and OA, specifically focusing on estrogen deficiency and hormone replacement therapy, have been reviewed elsewhere. Clinical studies demonstrate that estrogen supplementation leads to modest but sustained reductions in joint pain frequency among postmenopausal women. Specifically, analyses of clinical trial data reveal that the prevalence and severity of joint pain in postmenopausal patients is lower among those receiving estrogen supplementation compared to those receiving placebo, calcium, or vitamin D. While there are promising results regarding hormone replacement therapy, its efficacy in managing OA remains uncertain, due to inadequate clinical reports. The risks of hormone replacement therapy differ depending on type, dose, duration of use, route of administration, and timing of initiation – Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are a specific class of estrogen receptor binding compounds that exhibit tissue-selective effects. Current studies demonstrate that SERMs have more consistent beneficial effects on bone tissue, leading to the approval of lasofoxifene and bazedoxifene for osteoporosis treatment in the USA –. Additional studies have found SERMs also beneficially impact other joint tissues, helping to maintain overall joint health.

### Shoulder pain in the community: an examination of associative factors using a longitudinal cohort study [^771270e2]. Arthritis Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine factors that are predictive of incident, recurrent, or resolved shoulder pain in a community-based sample from the general population.

Methods

This study used data from the North West Adelaide Health Study, a cohort study located in the northwestern suburbs of Adelaide, South Australia. Data were obtained between 2004 and 2006 and between 2008 and 2010, with time between measurements ranging from 2–6 years (median 4 years), using a computer-assisted telephone interview, a clinical assessment, and a self-completed questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the factors associated with shoulder pain.

Results

Overall, 14.6% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 12.7–16.7) of 2,337 eligible participants reported that they had developed (or had incident) shoulder pain between 2 time points of the cohort study, 8.8% (95% CI 7.5–10.3) reported recurrent shoulder pain, and 8.7% (95% CI 7.0–10.6) had resolved shoulder pain. Incident shoulder pain was significantly associated with physically heavier occupational activities and pain in other joints after adjustment for age, sex, and body mass index. Recurrent shoulder pain was also associated with pain in other joints, but also with depressive symptoms, smoking, and decreased shoulder range of movement. Resolved shoulder pain was associated with being female, other areas of pain, and decreased shoulder range of movement, but higher grip strength.

Conclusion

Different factors were associated with incident, recurrent, or resolved shoulder pain in a longitudinal cohort study. Consideration of all of these factors may assist in the prevention and management of shoulder pain and the possible identification of those at risk of long-term shoulder problems.
