## Question

Ingrown toenail antibiotic

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when antibiotics are indicated for an ingrown toenail and how to manage it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the underlying pathophysiology and whether infection is truly present. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines say about oral antibiotics in uncomplicated cases. Next, I will review randomized and observational evidence on prophylactic antibiotics after procedures. After that, I need to define clear indications for antibiotics, including cellulitis and special populations. Finally, I will outline evidence-based treatment pathways and address common pitfalls and exceptions, anchoring to AAFP and IDSA guidance where possible.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct: most ingrown toenails reflect mechanical trauma from the nail plate impinging on the lateral nail folds, producing pain, granulation tissue, and sometimes purulence. True bacterial cellulitis is a separate diagnosis that requires systemic therapy, whereas local inflammation without spreading infection does not mandate antibiotics, and I should be careful not to conflate the two [^1167kam4] [^114pSATx].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline stance on oral antibiotics in uncomplicated cases. AAFP 2019 explicitly recommends not using oral antibiotics for ingrown toenails unless cellulitis is present, and older primary care guidance similarly notes that antibiotics before or after phenolization do not improve outcomes, so routine oral antibiotics are not indicated in the absence of spreading infection [^113zAjPp] [^115rHytV].

> I will now examine procedural antibiotic prophylaxis. A randomized trial of partial nail avulsion with or without local gentamicin showed no reduction in infection or recurrence with local antibiotics, and Cochrane reviews of postoperative interventions likewise found no benefit of antibiotics in reducing infection, pain, or healing time, so prophylactic antibiotics — local or systemic — should not be used routinely after ingrown toenail surgery [^114BJhHf] [^112iFpfg].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should define when antibiotics are actually indicated. I need to ensure I screen for cellulitis: expanding erythema, warmth, tenderness beyond the immediate nail fold, systemic features, or concern for deeper infection. In those cases, IDSA SSTI guidance supports systemic antibiotics active against streptococci, with MRSA coverage when risk factors are present, typically for about 5 days, extending if not improved, and with attention to predisposing factors like toe-web maceration or edema [^114pSATx] [^114NgcMq].

> Let me consider special populations where the threshold may shift. In patients with diabetes and a diabetic foot infection, systemic antibiotics are indicated for infected wounds, with route and duration tailored to severity, but topical antibiotics are not recommended as adjuncts to systemic therapy and should be avoided for uninfected ulcers, so I should confirm true infection before prescribing and avoid unnecessary topical antibiotics in this context [^112k9Q94] [^112zPopd] [^113XMgvb].

> But wait, what if the patient is immunocompromised or has inflammatory arthritis? I should double-check that guidance advises considering antibiotics when infection is present and coordinating with the rheumatology team, including holding immunosuppressive therapy during active infection, which reinforces a lower threshold for systemic therapy when cellulitis is suspected in these groups [^111GjXED].

> Next, I should review the evidence-based treatment pathway. For mild disease, conservative measures such as warm soaks, topical steroids, cotton or dental floss elevation, and gutter splinting are appropriate, while for moderate to severe or recurrent disease, partial nail avulsion with chemical matricectomy using phenol or sodium hydroxide is preferred to reduce recurrence, acknowledging that phenol may increase postoperative infection risk compared with excision alone even as it lowers recurrence, so meticulous technique and postoperative care matter [^1167kam4] [^114ah14F] [^111Kv3hs].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought antibiotics might help with pain or faster healing after surgery. Let me reconsider in light of the randomized data showing no benefit of local gentamicin on infection or recurrence and Cochrane findings that postoperative antibiotics do not improve infection, pain, or healing, so I should correct that assumption and avoid reflex antibiotic prescribing after procedures [^114BJhHf] [^112iFpfg].

> I should confirm the bottom line and ensure my plan aligns with guidelines: antibiotics are not indicated for uncomplicated ingrown toenails without cellulitis, prophylactic antibiotics should not be given for surgical procedures, and antibiotics are reserved for documented cellulitis or special scenarios such as diabetic foot infection or significant immunocompromise where infection is present or strongly suspected, with therapy guided by SSTI principles and local epidemiology [^113zAjPp] [^114pSATx] [^112k9Q94].

---

Oral antibiotics are **not routinely indicated** for ingrown toenails without cellulitis [^113zAjPp] because they do not improve outcomes and should be avoided to limit resistance and adverse effects [^116QXJ3m]. Use antibiotics only when there is **cellulitis or systemic features** [^114pSATx]; otherwise, treat with local care and surgery if needed [^115JVE3r]. If cellulitis is present, use oral agents active against streptococci (e.g. cephalexin, amoxicillin-clavulanate) for 5–7 days, adding MRSA coverage if risk factors exist [^114pSATx]. Topical antibiotics are ineffective and not recommended [^112iFpfg] [^114BJhHf].

---

## Indications for antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are **not routinely indicated** for uncomplicated ingrown toenails [^113zAjPp]. They should be reserved for specific clinical scenarios, including:

- **Cellulitis**: Presence of spreading erythema, warmth, swelling, or systemic signs (fever, malaise) [^114pSATx].

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Increased risk of infection and complications [^116fTQX4].

- **Diabetic patients**: Higher risk of infection and poor wound healing [^11545M1m].

- **Recurrent or chronic infections**: Persistent or recurrent infections despite conservative management [^117Ntmyk].

---

## Recommended antibiotic regimens

When antibiotics are indicated, the following **oral regimens** are recommended:

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Cephalexin | 500 mg orally every 6 hours for 5–7 days | First-line for mild cellulitis |
| Amoxicillin-clavulanate | 875/125 mg orally every 12 hours for 5–7 days | First-line for mild cellulitis |
| Clindamycin | 300 mg orally every 8 hours for 5–7 days | Penicillin allergy or MRSA coverage |
| Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole | 1–2 double-strength tablets orally every 12 hours for 5–7 days | MRSA coverage |

---

Duration of therapy is typically **5–7 days**, extended to 10–14 days if the infection is severe or slow to resolve.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting antibiotic use

Evidence supporting routine antibiotic use in uncomplicated ingrown toenails is **limited** [^113zAjPp]. A randomized controlled trial found no significant difference in healing time or recurrence rates between patients receiving antibiotics and those who did not receive antibiotics after partial nail avulsion with phenolization [^116QXJ3m]. Similarly, a Cochrane review concluded that postoperative antibiotics do not significantly reduce infection rates, pain, or healing time after surgical interventions for ingrown toenails [^112iFpfg].

---

## Potential risks and side effects of antibiotic therapy

Antibiotic therapy carries potential risks and side effects, including:

- **Allergic reactions**: Rash, urticaria, anaphylaxis.

- **Gastrointestinal disturbances**: Nausea, diarrhea, antibiotic-associated colitis.

- **Antibiotic resistance**: Development of resistant bacterial strains.

- **Drug interactions**: Particularly with immunosuppressive medications [^notfound].

---

## Alternative treatments and preventive measures

Conservative management and preventive measures are **effective alternatives** to antibiotic therapy:

- **Warm soaks**: Soaking the affected toe in warm, soapy water for 10–20 minutes daily [^116QXJ3m].

- **Cotton wisp technique**: Placing cotton wisps or dental floss under the ingrown nail edge to relieve pressure [^116QXJ3m].

- **Proper nail care**: Trimming nails straight across and avoiding tight footwear [^1167kam4].

- **Surgical interventions**: Partial nail avulsion with phenolization or surgical excision of the nail matrix for recurrent or severe cases [^115JVE3r] [^116qSGY2].

---

## Special considerations

Certain patient populations require **special consideration**:

- **Diabetic patients**: Careful assessment for infection, wound healing issues, and potential complications [^11545M1m].

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Lower threshold for antibiotic use and close monitoring [^114pSATx].

- **Pediatric patients**: Conservative management is often preferred, with surgical interventions reserved for severe or recurrent cases [^notfound].

---

Oral antibiotics are **not routinely indicated** for uncomplicated ingrown toenails [^113zAjPp]. They should be reserved for cases with cellulitis or systemic features, with cephalexin or amoxicillin-clavulanate as first-line agents. Conservative management and surgical interventions are effective alternatives, and antibiotic use should be guided by clinical judgment to minimize risks and resistance.

### Randomized clinical trial of surgical technique and local antibiotics for ingrowing toenail [^114BJhHf]. The British Journal of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to investigate different surgical techniques for treating ingrowing toenails (IGTNs) and to determine the value of a locally applied antibiotic after intervention.

Methods

One hundred and twenty-three patients with IGTN were assigned randomly to one of four groups. All patients had partial nail avulsion. This was combined with excision of the matrix or application of phenol, with or without local application of gentamicin afterwards. All procedures were performed by one physician. The primary outcome measure was symptomatic recurrence of IGTN.

Results

One hundred and seventeen patients were available for follow-up. Phenol gave significantly better results than matrix excision with respect to recurrence (including regrowth and spike formation) after 1 year (P < 0.001). In terms of signs of infection, there was no significant difference between phenol and matrix excision after 2 days (P = 0.224) or 1 week (P = 0.501). Antibiotics had no effect in reducing the risk of infection after 2 days (P = 0.989) or 1 week (P = 0.676), or in reducing the rate of recurrent IGTN at 1 year (P = 0.187). If regrowth or spike formation is included, the effect is even less significant (P = 0.876).

Conclusion

Partial nail avulsion with phenolization gave better results than partial avulsion with matrix excision. Local antibiotics did not reduce signs of infection or recurrence. Use of phenol did not produce more signs of infection than matrix excision.

### Efficacy of nail braces for acute and chronic ingrown toenails: a prospective study [^114BEGpj]. Dermatologic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Nail braces are an alternative treatment for ingrown toenails.

Objective

This study aimed to prospectively examine the efficacy of nail braces for treatment of acute inflamed (AI)-type and chronic dystrophic-type ingrown toenails.

Materials and Methods

The authors conducted a prospective study of patients with ingrown toenails treated at Wan Fang Hospital between January 1, 2017, and July 31, 2018. Evaluation using physician global assessment scores and patient satisfaction questionnaires was performed at 1, 3, and 6 months after the start of treatment and during the final visit. Patient demographics, treatment courses, and outcomes were compared between the 2 types of ingrown toenails.

Results

Chronic dystrophic-type and AI-type ingrown toenails were observed in 25 (61 sides) and 28 patients (35 sides), respectively. Of the affected sides, 80.9%, 94.9%, and 100% achieved an excellent or fair result at 1, 3, and 6 months, respectively. Treatment duration and follow-up period were 179.2 ± 96.8 days and 281.6 ± 120.9, respectively. The recurrence rate was 7.4%. The treatment course and response were different between the 2 types of ingrown toenails.

Conclusion

Ingrown toenails could be effectively treated with nail braces with excellent outcomes, favorable patient satisfaction, and low recurrence rates.

### Ingrown toenails: a survey among dermatologists on current treatments [^114BvXT9]. Dermatologic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

To date, there is no formal consensus on how to treat ingrown toenails. Despite the risk of causing irreparable damage to the nail, highly invasive procedures are still common. Less-invasive, matrix-directed techniques with shorter downtime and high cure rates exist, but, perhaps because of a lack of awareness, appear not to have been universally adopted.

Objective

The authors' study sought to generate data on common practices in the treatment of ingrown toenails.

Materials and Methods

The authors developed and conducted an online survey to ask dermatologists/dermatosurgeons how they would proceed in 9 different cases of ingrown toenails based on photographs.

Results

The authors received 154 replies. Nonsurgical interventions, including advice on nail care/foot baths/ointments/wraps/padding, were always the most frequently chosen option. Removal of the lateral nail plate followed by chemical partial matricectomy (phenolization) was the most or second-most frequently chosen surgical intervention. The answers were highly heterogeneous, and there was no unanimity based on morphology alone.

Conclusion

Except for a preference for nonsurgical interventions, the authors could not identify any clear treatment standards. The heterogeneity of treatment approaches suggests the need for a guideline.

### Increasing hospitalizations and general practice prescriptions for community-onset staphylococcal disease, england [^112XBbb8]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

To verify that observed trends were not part of a generalized increase in hospital admissions, we used HES data to examine trends in the following control conditions: appendicitis, cholecystitis, conjunctivitis, fractured forearm, gastroenteritis/diarrhea of presumed infectious origin, ingrown toenail, and erysipelas. These conditions were chosen as examples of acute community-onset conditions that are not normally caused by staphylococci. We also examined trends in hospitalizations for septicemia in which staphylococci were not identified as the causative organism.

We analyzed data from the Prescription Prescribing Authority, which collects information on all prescriptions issued by general practitioners and dispensed by community pharmacists and dispensing general practitioners (PACT data). The information collected includes the name of the drug and the number of items dispensed (an item is defined as each preparation on the prescription). The data cannot be linked routinely to patient demographic or clinical data. Hence, they cannot be used to calculate age- and sex-specific prescribing rates or to look at prescribing rates for specific conditions. We obtained data on all GP prescriptions of floxacillin (including co-fluampicil) and fusidic acid (excluding Fucidin eyedrops but including combined steroid and fucidic acid preparations) for England from 1991 through 2006. We focused on prescriptions of floxacillin and fusidic acid because staphylococcal infection is the only indication given for these conditions in the British National Formulary. We used national population data to calculate crude annual prescribing rates. Analyses used anonymous aggregate data and did not require ethical approval.

### Executive summary: the British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of foot health in inflammatory arthritis [^114cr7x1]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Two RCTs concluded that sharp scalpel debridement had no benefits over sham debridement in adults with IA. In a small prospective cohort study (n = 8), treatment effect was lost by seven days. The rationale for adjunctive treatments are discussed under Recommendations 4–10 and 13. No studies have been undertaken in adults with other types of IA, or children and young people with IA. GWG members with podiatric expertise agreed that inflammatory callus margins in PsA should not be debrided. In the case of suspected ulceration, and in people with diabetes, sharp scalpel debridement of overlying callus should be performed to reveal the size and nature of the ulcer, assess for infection and promote healing. Additionally, callus is a risk factor for foot ulceration in people with diabetes, and sharp scalpel debridement should be performed. Sharp debridement, when required, should only be undertaken by competent practitioners with specialist training.

13. Emollients are safe and effective, and can be offered for the relief of dry skin affecting the foot in IA. SOR: 1; LOE: C; SOA: 96.

Rationale

The effectiveness of emollients for foot health in IA has not been formally evaluated in clinical studies. Emollients are widely recommended for other conditions (e.g. in eczema and diabetes), and risk of harm is low. Consideration should be given to other physical problems experienced by some people with IA, such as hand problems, which could make the application of emollients difficult.

14. All adults or children and young people with IA should be offered personalized nail care advice, including footwear advice, to help prevent and/or treat common toenail pathologies. People should be advised when to access foot health care, e.g. for ingrowing toenails, wounds and infections, and how to do this. SOR: 2; LOE: C; SOA: 99.
15. Systemic control of disease activity is the aim of treatment, including joint disease and extra-articular manifestations, e.g. skin and nail disease in psoriatic arthritis. Foot skin and nail health should be assessed and managed in the context of systemic disease. SOR: 1; LOE: C; SOA: 98.
16. In the presence of recurrent pain or infection, surgical removal of nails can be considered. SOR: 2; LOE: C; SOA: 96.

### Ingrown toenail management [^1167kam4]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Ingrown toenails account for approximately 20% of foot problems in primary care. The great toe is most often affected. Ingrown toenails occur most commonly in young men, and nail care habits and footwear are most often contributory factors. No consensus has been reached for the best treatment approach, but ingrown nails may be nonsurgically or surgically treated. Nonsurgical treatments are typically used for mild to moderate ingrown nails, whereas surgical approaches are used in moderate and severe cases. Simple nonsurgical palliative measures include correcting inappropriate footwear, managing hyperhidrosis and onychomycosis, soaking the affected toe followed by applying a mid- to high-potency topical steroid, and placing wisps of cotton or dental floss under the ingrown lateral nail edge. Application of a gutter splint to the ingrown nail edge to separate it from the lateral fold provides immediate pain relief. A cotton nail cast made from cotton and cyanoacrylate adhesive, taping the lateral nail fold, or orthonyxia may also alleviate mild to moderate ingrown toenail. Surgical approaches seek to remove the interaction between the nail plate and the nail fold to eliminate local trauma and inflammatory reaction. These approaches are superior to nonsurgical ones for preventing recurrence. The most common surgical approach is partial avulsion of the lateral edge of the nail plate. Matrixectomy further prevents recurrence and can be performed through surgical, chemical, or electrosurgical means.

### Modified sleeve method treatment of ingrown toenail [^1137gPaU]. Dermatologic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Ingrown toenail is a common problem that causes inconvenience, pain, and limitation of daily function. Current conventional treatment methods are not satisfactory and have a high recurrence rate.

Objective

To evaluate a modification of an existing, although uncommonly used, method for treating ingrown toenail.

Methods

Patients with ingrown toenail were treated under local anesthesia by insertion of a flexible narrow plastic tube under the toenail along its lateral border. Tube fixation was performed with silk or nylon 2–0 sutures passed through the toenail. Granulomatous and inflamed tissue was removed by electrocautery or local excision.

Results

Twenty-eight procedures were performed in 25 patients. In 20 procedures (71.4%), no recurrences were recorded; the other 8 procedures (28.6%), were symptomatic.

Conclusion

This method for the treatment of ingrown toenail was found to be simple and efficient, with a relatively low recurrence rate. Therefore we currently advocate this procedure as the treatment of choice.

### Lateral foldplasty with or without partial matricectomy for the management of ingrown toenails [^111MLzCG]. Dermatologic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Ingrown toenails are common and lead to significant morbidity.

Objective

This retrospective study was aimed at evaluation of our new surgical technique of lateral foldplasty with limited lateral matrix resection in some cases for the management of ingrown toenails with regard to recurrence rates, spicule formation, local infection, partial flap necrosis, and cosmetic outcome.

Methods & Materials

Thirty-two patients with 52 ingrown nails were included in this study. Lateral foldplasty procedure alone was preferred for the surgical treatment of 18 ingrown toenails of mild to moderate severity. Lateral foldplasty with limited lateral matrix resection was performed in 34 ingrown nails in patients with broad nail plates or for moderate to severe cases with significant granulation tissue formation.

Results

Relapse rate, local infection rate, and partial flap necrosis rate were very low. Spicule formation was not observed. The cosmetic appearance of the nail did not disturb any patient treated with this procedure.

Conclusion

The lateral foldplasty procedure alone or combined with limited lateral matrix resection is a cheap, simple, and satisfactory technique for the treatment of ingrown toenails with a low risk of relapse. This technique also has good cosmetic results.

### Executive summary: the British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of foot health in inflammatory arthritis [^111GjXED]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Consideration should be given to the appropriateness of self-management of toenail pathologies, and when and how to access specialist foot services (see Recommendation 3).

In PsA, where multiple nails are pathological, systemic rather than local treatment should be considered and dermatology input should be sought. Widespread psoriasis, or foot psoriasis that is unresponsive to topical treatment, should prompt a review of systemic disease management.

Nail surgery should be considered for toenail pathologies that do not or are thought unlikely to resolve with conservative care. When infection is present, antibiotics should be considered and DMARD/biologic therapy suspended, with input from the rheumatology MDT. There is no evidence for one type of nail avulsion surgery procedure over another in IA or generally; matrixectomy should therefore be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Wound management

17. Adults, children and young people with IA and foot ulceration should be able to access an appropriate health professional(s) promptly. SOR: 2; LOE: C; SOA: 99.
18. Assessment of adults, children and young people with IA and foot ulceration should include causation, infection, wound severity and disease activity, in the context of their IA, comorbidities and their treatment. SOR: 2; LOE: C; SOA: 99.
19. Wound management could include wound cleansing, removal of devitalized tissue, application of topical medicinal products or dressings, or offloading, as appropriate. Systemic treatment for infection and/or IA disease activity should be considered. SOR: 2; LOE: C; SOA: 98.

Rationale

Recommendations are based on evidence for managing foot ulceration generally and expert opinion. Patients with or at high risk of foot ulceration should be advised how and when to access a health professional. Patient education regarding how to access a health professional is pertinent. Timely communication between the health professional who first identifies a wound and the rheumatology MDT ensures ulceration is not managed in isolation. Foot ulcer management principles include offloading, restoration of tissue perfusion, treatment of infection, treatment of comorbidities, local ulcer care, patient education and ulcer prevention. Collection of a wound sample can be considered where infection is clinically suspected. Stopping conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) and biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) in the presence of infection should be discussed with the rheumatology MDT, with further guidance available in the BSR guidelines for bDMARD safety and prescribing and monitoring of non-biologic DMARDs.

### Marjolin's squamous cell carcinoma of the hallux following recurrent ingrown toenail infections [^116N9ycG]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Marjolin's squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) affecting the toe is rare. Due to resemblance with benign conditions it can often result in misdiagnosis. We report a case of Marjolin's SCC affecting the proximal hallux in a patient with recurrent ingrown toenail infections. A 58-year-old woman with a background of wedge resections for ingrown toenail and distal phalanx amputation for osteomyelitis presented with pain and hyperkeratotic raised ulcer around the proximal phalanx. MRI scan revealed soft tissue mass infiltrating the proximal phalanx with biopsies confirming a SCC. The patient underwent first ray amputation and made a good clinical recovery and remains disease free. Due to clinical similarities with benign conditions, awareness of Marjolin's SCC as a potential diagnosis when treating patients with recurrent ingrown toenail is imperative. We recommend patients with recurrent ingrown toenail or ulceration with a background of chronic infection have biopsies performed to exclude potential malignancy.

### IWGDF / IDSA guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes-related foot infections (IWGDF / IDSA 2023) [^112k9Q94]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2024). High credibility.

IWGDF/IDSA 2023 — Systemic antibiotic therapy and duration for soft-tissue diabetic foot infection (DFI): Use any systemic antibiotic regimens shown effective in published randomised controlled trials to treat a person with diabetes and a soft-tissue infection of the foot (Strong; High). Administer therapy for 1–2 weeks (Strong; High). Consider continuing treatment for up to 3–4 weeks if the infection is improving but is extensive and resolving slower than expected or if the patient has severe peripheral arterial disease (PAD) (Conditional, Low). If evidence of infection has not resolved after 4 weeks of apparently appropriate therapy, re-evaluate the patient and reconsider further diagnostic studies or alternative treatments (Strong; Low).

### Therapeutic recommendations for the treatment of toenail onychomycosis in the US [^115MkSxK]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis affects around 14% of individuals in North America and Europe and is undertreated. Treatment is challenging as toenail growth can take 12&ndash;18 months, the nail plate may prevent drug penetration, and disease recurrence is common. National guidelines/consensus documents on onychomycosis diagnosis and treatment were last published more than 5 years ago and updated medical guidance is needed.

Methods

This document aims to provide recommendations for the diagnosis and pharmaceutical treatment of toenail onychomycosis following a roundtable discussion with a panel of dermatologists, podiatrists, and a microbiologist specializing in nail disease.

Results

There was a general consensus on several topics regarding onychomycosis diagnosis, confirmatory laboratory testing, and medications. Onychomycosis should be assessed clinically and confirmed with microscopy, histology, and/or culture. Terbinafine is the primary choice for oral treatment and efinaconazole 10% for topical treatment. Efinaconazole can also be considered for off-label use for maintenance to prevent recurrences. For optimal outcomes, patients should be counseled regarding treatment expectations as well as follow-up care and maintenance post-treatment.

Conclusions

This article provides important updates to previous guidelines/consensus documents to assist dermatologists and podiatrists in the diagnosis and treatment of toenail onychomycosis. J Drugs Dermatol. 2021;20(10):1076–1084. doi:10.36849/JDD.6291.

### Comparison of phenol matricectomy and nail-splinting with a flexible tube for the treatment of ingrown toenails [^1173Do5H]. Dermatologic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The treatment of ingrown toenail is usually bothersome for patients and doctors.

Objectives

To compare two treatment techniques of ingrown toenails-phenol matricectomy (PM) and nail-splinting using a flexible tube (FT)-in terms of efficacy, postoperative pain, postoperative cosmetic satisfaction, amount of tissue damage, and recurrence.

Methods and Materials

One hundred twenty ingrown toenails were randomized and divided into PM and FT groups. All cases were evaluated 2 days and 1 and 6 months after treatment. Postoperative pain, cosmetic satisfaction, time to recovery, and recurrence rate were measured.

Results

Postoperative pain was less and cosmetic satisfaction was good in both groups (p < .001). Our recurrence rate was 8.4%. There were no statistical differences between groups in these measures. Tissue improvement rate was 6% in the PM group and 93% in the FT group 2 days after the procedures (p < .001).

Conclusions

Although FT provides faster recovery and less postoperative morbidity than PM, the techniques are equally effective in treating ingrown toenails.

### Terminal syme amputation of the great toe in the pediatric population [^114hLU32]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In the pediatric population, chronic ingrown toenails (onychocryptosis) can cause infection (paronychia), debilitating pain, and may be unresponsive to conservative treatments. Following multiple failed interventions, a terminal Syme amputation is one option for definitive treatment of chronic onychocryptosis. This procedure involves amputation of the distal aspect of the distal phalanx of the great toe with complete removal of the nail bed and germinal center, preventing further nail growth and recurrence.

Methods

A retrospective review was performed to determine outcomes of a terminal Syme amputation in the pediatric population. Inclusion criteria included treatment of onychocryptosis involving terminal Syme amputation with a minimum follow-up of 1 year. The medical record was reviewed to assess previous failed treatment efforts, perioperative complications, radiographic outcomes, and the need for additional procedures.

Results

From 1984 to 2017, 11 patients (13 halluces) with onychocryptosis were treated with a terminal Syme amputation. There were no intraoperative complications. One hallux had a postoperative infection requiring antibiotics as well as partial nail regrowth following the terminal Syme procedure that required subsequent removal of the residual nail. Following partial nail ablation, the patient had no further nail growth. An additional patient also developed a postoperative infection requiring oral antibiotic treatment. All patients returned to full weight-bearing physical activities within 6 weeks of surgery.

Conclusions

Terminal Syme amputation was successful in treating pediatric patients who have recalcitrant onychocryptosis and paronychia. There was little functional consequence following terminal Syme amputation of the great toe in this patient population, making it an effective salvage procedure.

Level Of Evidence

Level IV-retrospective comparative study.

### IWGDF / IDSA guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes-related foot infections (IWGDF / IDSA 2023) [^1119We4k]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2024). High credibility.

IWGDF/IDSA 2023 — Topical antibiotics in diabetes-related foot infection (DFI) and diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO) are not supported by current evidence. Studies of topical antibiotics as adjuncts to systemic therapy in soft-tissue DFI have produced conflicting results, and overall do not show a significant clinical benefit for soft-tissue or bone infections; therefore, the guideline suggests against their use, despite limited signals from antibiotic-loaded cement or intraoperative vancomycin powder during DFO surgical debridement.

### IWGDF / IDSA guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes-related foot infections (IWGDF / IDSA 2023) [^112zPopd]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic foot infection, more specifically with respect to topical antimicrobials, IDSA/IWGDF 2024 guidelines recommend to avoid using topical (sponge, cream, and cement) antibiotics in combination with systemic antibiotics for the treatment of diabetic soft tissue infection or foot osteomyelitis.

Besides the fact that our study is retrospective withloss or lack of data for certain variables, it has several limitations. Firstly, patients who were subsequently treated outside of our centre may have been lost to follow‐up. However, our centre is the largest, and the only public, hospital in the region with a large catchment area. Indeed, patients seeking medical care consult mainly at our hospital, making this an unlikely major bias. Secondly, we did not analyse the antibiotic agents that were used, or the role of specific pathogens. This is based on the lack of evidence that any specific systemic antibiotic regimen is significantly superior for treatment of DFI, regardless of the involved pathogens. 1, 13, 15 Our study population and pathogens recovered were consistent with those reported in the literature. 1, 6 Moreover, antibiotic regimens often change throughout treatment course for these complex cases. In our study, 109 antibiotic regimens were changed during the course of therapy for a given infection episode. Likewise, we did not routinely assess residual stump osteomyelitis in patients undergoing atrial amputation. However, recent studies doubt about the accuracy of these specimens, 11 especially when they were sampled through the operation site. Thirdly, it is noteworthy that wound care, especially pressure offloading of the affected limb, is crucial for treating DFI. 1 While the rationale of such measures is easily understandable, effectively implementing them depends on the patient's adherence, which we could not monitor in our assessment. Fourthly, we defined remission as the absence of any clinical, radiological or laboratory signs of recurrent or new DFI at the site of prior infection, within one year following treatment of the prior DFI episode. In DFI, microbiological patterns of consecutive DFI episodes are only congruent in two‐thirds of cases at most, 31 and new ischaemia, noncompliance, as well as inadequate anatomical positioning may lead to new infections at the same location. Hence, we overestimate the true risk of recurrence having more to do with patient's compliance or progressive ischaemia 1 rather than with antibiotic effects. Fifthly, there is certainly bias from confounding by indication; for example, patients who were suspected to have an unfavourable outcome might be those who were prescribed longer antibiotic courses. Only prospective randomized trials could help to fully circumvent this bias inherent to every retrospective study. Therefore, we renounced on formal propensity score analyses in our very heterogeneous study population. Finally, we included all DFI patients hospitalized for in toto amputations in order to reproduce routine clinical settings at best. This should not be confused with DFIs with proven postsurgical residual osteomyelitis. For this specific population, continuation of systemic antibiotic for 3‐4 weeks 21 is warranted.

### Proximal nail fold swelling, pain, and granulation tissue [^1163VHcB]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 28-year-old man presented with a 4-month history of left great toe pain, swelling, erythema, and drainage. The patient was previously treated with a topical antifungal, oral antibiotics, and hot water soaks without improvement of symptoms. The patient's toe upon presentation is depicted in Fig 1 and after gentle washing in Fig 2. The patient's nail plate is depicted in Fig 3.

Question 1. What is the diagnosis?

A. Acute paronychia
B. Onychomycosis
C. Retronychia
D. Squamous cell carcinoma
E. Ingrown nail

Answers

A. Acute paronychia – Incorrect. Acute paronychia is caused by a disruption in the seal of the nail fold and nail plate allowing often polymicrobial infections to develop in the local periungual soft tissues.
B. Onychomycosis – Incorrect. While onychomycosis can cause proximal onycholysis, it typically does not cause periungual inflammation and drainage.
C. Retronychia – Correct. The diagnosis of retronychia is made clinically. Criteria for diagnosis are chronic inflammation of the proximal nail fold, granulation tissue protruding from under the proximal nail fold, and thickened often doubled proximal nail plate. Retronychia occurs when the nail plate separates completely from the matrix and a new plate grows under the old plate. This pushes the nail plate upwards and causes inflammation to the proximal nail fold.
D. Squamous cell carcinoma – Incorrect. Although the presentation of squamous cell carcinoma varies, it typically appears as a periungual friable, verrucous mass with associated nail dystrophy.
E. Ingrown nail – Incorrect. Ingrown nails occur along the medial or lateral border of the nail fold. This patient's symptoms occurred at the proximal nail fold.

### Surgical matricectomy versus phenolization in the treatment of ingrown toenails: a randomized controlled trial [^113fVWGX]. Dermatologic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment of ingrown toenail includes various nonsurgical and surgical treatments. However, there is no consensus on the ideal first-choice treatment.

Objective

To compare phenolization versus surgical matricectomy (SM) after lateral nail plate avulsion in terms of efficacy, recurrence rates, postoperative outcomes, and cosmesis.

Methods

The authors enrolled 45 consenting patients and randomized them into 2 groups (Group 1 = phenolization and Group 2 = SM) using stratified block randomization and followed them up at 1 week, 1 month, and 6 months.

Results

The median percentage improvement in pain visual analog scale (VAS) score was comparable between the 2 groups (p = 0.793). The mean photo VAS showed significant improvement in Group 1 at 1 week (p = 0.00) and 1 month (p = 0.02) but not at 6 months (p = 0.44). The median number of days for pain relief (p = 0.169), for healing (p = 0.192), and for resuming work (p = 0.136) were not significantly different between the 2 groups. The time required to regain normal morphology was significantly longer in Group 2 (p = 0.006). None of the patients in either group presented with recurrence at 6 months and 1 year. The authors observed failure of treatment in 1 patient in Group 2.

Conclusion

Both procedures were equally efficacious, had minimal complications, and showed no recurrence at 6 months and 1 year.

### The British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of foot health in inflammatory arthritis [^117A6vZR]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

The effectiveness of emollients for foot health in IA has not been formally evaluated in clinical trials. Emollients are widely recommended for dry skin conditions generally and for dry skin on the feet (with the exception of interdigital areas), and for plantar callus for people with foot problems in diabetes. Emollients are also recommended for people with psoriasis to improve dryness, scaling and cracking, particularly for the soles of the feet. The SOR is based on expert opinion, widespread use of emollients in routine practice and low risk of harm. Consideration should be given to other physical problems experienced by some people with IA, such as hand problems, which could make the application of emollients difficult.

(14) All adults or children and young people with IA should be offered personalized nail care advice, including footwear advice, to help prevent and/or treat common toenail pathologies. People should be advised when to access foot healthcare, for example, for ingrowing toenails, wounds and infections, and how to do this. SOR: 2; LOE: C; SOA: 99.
(15) Systemic control of disease activity is the aim of treatment, including joint disease and extra-articular manifestations, e.g. skin and nail disease in PsA. Foot skin and nail health should be assessed and managed in the context of systemic disease. SOR: 1; LOE: C; SOA: 98.
(16) In the presence of recurrent pain or infection, surgical removal of nails can be considered. SOR: 2; LOE: C; SOA: 96.

### The effectiveness of matrix ablation with silver nitrate in the treatment of ingrown toenails. A single-center case-control study [^111zY6z7]. Pediatric Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Partial onychectomy with chemical matrixectomy is considered the gold standard treatment for stage II-III ingrown toenails (IT). However, there are scarce reports describing the use of silver nitrate in IT management in adolescents. Our aim is to analyze the effectiveness of matrix ablation with silver nitrate and compare it with partial onychectomy by electrocautery.

Methods

A retrospective study of adolescent patients with stage II-III IT was performed. Those who underwent electrocautery matricectomy in a major outpatient surgical center (Group A) and those who were treated with silver nitrate at an outpatient clinic (Group B) were compared. Efficacy was determined by recurrence and postoperative infection rates.

Results

Two hundred and nine patients were included (86 group A; 123 group B), with a total of 382 partial onychectomies (151 group A; 231 group B). Group B patients exhibited a lower recurrence rate (4.7%) when compared to group A (11.2%, p = .02), and had a lower postoperative infection rate (4.0% group A vs. 1.7% group B; p = .18), although not statistically significant.

Conclusion

Silver nitrate chemical matricectomy after partial onychectomy is an effective treatment for IT in adolescents, with few postoperative complications and low recurrence rate. Therefore, it should be considered as a possible alternative to electrocautery matricectomy.

### Treatment of ingrown toenails in the pediatric population [^114ejwbg]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background/Purpose

Nail avulsion plus chemical matrixectomy (CM) using NaOH as an alternative to surgical matrixectomy (SM) has recently been used in the treatment of ingrown toenails (IGTNs) in adults. No studies exist to dictate the most effective and safe treatment method in the pediatric population.

Methods

A retrospective review of pediatric IGTNs treated at 2 institutions for 6 years was done, looking at presentation, treatment modality, SM vs CM, and outcomes.

Results

Eight hundred forty-eight IGTNs in 518 patients were reviewed with an average age of 12.5 years. Twenty-three percent were felt to be infected at the time of presentation, and 34% were being treated with antibiotics within the preceding week of surgery. Seventy-nine percent of toenails underwent surgical management with the most common procedure being avulsion plus SM (65%), followed by avulsion plus CM (17%), and avulsion alone (14%). The overall recurrence rate after initial surgery was 19.5%. After adjusting for covariates, recurrence was associated with treatment by avulsion alone (odds ratio [OR], 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5–4.7), avulsion plus CM (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1–0.7), and treatment with antibiotics within the week before surgery (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3–0.9; p = 0.017). The overall postoperative infection rate was 6% and was unrelated to presence of preoperative infection, use of antibiotics, or surgical treatment method.

Conclusions

Ingrown toenails present a significant problem to youth and should be addressed in a diligent fashion. Chemical matrixectomy using NaOH is a safe and effective alternative to SM and maybe associated with a lower rate of recurrence, especially when use in conjunction with preoperative antibiotics.

### Ciclopirox (Ciclodan) [^111AwtXi]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Trials Data

The results of use of Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), in treatment of onychomycosis of the toenail without lunula involvement were obtained from two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies conducted in the US. In these studies, patients with onychomycosis of the great toenails without lunula involvement were treated with ciclopirox topical solution, 8% in conjunction with monthly removal of the unattached, infected toenail by the investigator. Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), was applied for 48 weeks. At baseline, patients had 20–65% involvement of the target great toenail plate. Statistical significance was demonstrated in one of two studies for the endpoint "complete cure" (clear nail and negative mycology), and in two studies for the endpoint "almost clear" (≤ 10% nail involvement and negative mycology) at the end of study. These results are presented below.

The summary of reported patient outcomes for the ITT population at 12 weeks following the end of treatment are presented below. Note that post-treatment efficacy assessments were scheduled only for patients who achieved a complete cure.

### Wedge excision of the nail fold in the treatment of ingrown toenail [^111BpRQ5]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Many treatment modalities of ingrown toenail are reported in the literature, often associated with unacceptably high recurrence rate. The authors present their technique, which aims at reducing the convexity of the nail fold. After complete removal of the nail plate and accurate debridement of the granulomatous tissue, a wedge-shaped ellipsis of skin and subcutaneous tissue, lateral to the affected nail fold, is removed. Approximation of the margins of the resulting defect determines eversion of the nail fold. One hundred twenty ingrown toenails were treated with the wedge excision of the nail fold at the outpatient clinic of the department of plastic surgery, Campus Bio-Medico University, Rome, Italy, between January 1998 and January 2002. Six recurrences were observed. In addition to the high cure rate, short postoperative pain duration, and morbidity as well as low risk of postoperative infection, the remarkable esthetic results achievable with this method are indicated.

### Ciclopirox (Ciclodan) [^111EXHnf]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Information for Patients

Patients should have detailed instructions regarding the use of Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), as a component of a comprehensive management program for onychomycosis in order to achieve maximum benefit with the use of this product.

The patient should be told to:

Use Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), as directed by a health care professional. Avoid contact with the eyes and mucous membranes. Contact with skin other than skin immediately surrounding the treated nail(s) should be avoided. Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), is for external use only.
Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), should be applied evenly over the entire nail plate and 5 mm of surrounding skin. If possible, Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), should be applied to the nail bed, hyponychium, and the under surface of the nail plate when it is free of the nail bed (e.g., onycholysis). Contact with the surrounding skin may produce mild, transient irritation (redness).
Removal of the unattached, infected nail, as frequently as monthly, by a health care professional is needed with use of this medication. Inform a health care professional if they have diabetes or problems with numbness in your toes or fingers for consideration of the appropriate nail management program.
Inform a health care professional if the area of application shows signs of increased irritation (redness, itching, burning, blistering, swelling, oozing).
Up to 48 weeks of daily applications with Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), and professional removal of the unattached, infected nail, as frequently as monthly, are considered the full treatment needed to achieve a clear or almost clear nail (defined as 10% or less residual nail involvement).
Six months of therapy with professional removal of the unattached, infected nail may be required before initial improvement of symptoms is noticed.
A completely clear nail may not be achieved with use of this medication. In clinical studies less than 12% of patients were able to achieve either a completely clear or almost clear toenail.
Do not use the medication for any disorder other than that for which it is prescribed.
Do not use nail polish or other nail cosmetic products on the treated nails.
Avoid use near heat or open flame, because product is flammable.

### Clinical study of treatment for recalcitrant ingrown toenail by partial distal phalanx removal [^1118iy1Y]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to identify putative aetiological factors of recalcitrant ingrown toenail and then to introduce a new surgical technique for its treatment on the basis of this identification. We found that many of our patients had an upturned morphology on the distal phalanx beneath the recalcitrant ingrown toenail. We thereby designed a new operative technique to treat this problem. From October 1997 to May 2006, 31 patients (38 toes), who were operated on using the new technique, were assigned to the experimental group. Another 38 patients, who were randomly selected from the population without an ingrown toenail, were assigned to the control group. Briefly, the operation is performed as follows: make an elliptical skin incision distal to the hyponychium. Remove the wedge of tissue through incision, together with the periosteum on the lateral side of the distal phalanx. Expose and then transect the distal part of the distal phalanx. Twenty-nine patients (36 toes) were included in the follow up which varied in length from 8 to 29 months. None of them had recurrent symptoms. In conclusion, an upturned abnormality of the distal phalanx may contribute, at least partly, to the formation of recalcitrant ingrown toenail. The partial distal phalanx removal could be considered as an effective technique in recalcitrant ingrown toenail therapy.

### Nail braces as an alternative treatment for ingrown toenails: results from a comparison with the winograd technique [^111VGLxw]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Ingrown toenails are one of the most frequent nail disorders and can be treated with conservative or surgical approaches. Although discovered a long time ago, the available data are still very limited on the potential effectiveness of nail braces for ingrown toenail treatment. In the present retrospective study, we compared nail braces with surgical wedge excision using the Winograd technique with respect to the time to return to work, recurrence, interval to recurrence, and patient satisfaction. A total of 159 patients were divided into the nail brace (n = 74; mean age 29.51 ± 8.48 years) and Winograd technique (n = 85; mean age 26.95 ± 8.06 years) groups. In the nail brace group, the mean time to return to work (4.15 ± 1.07 days) was significantly shorter than that in the Winograd technique group (13.8 ± 2.26 days; p < .001). Patient satisfaction was significantly greater in the nail brace group (94.6%) compared with the Winograd technique group (82.4%; p = .018). Of the 159 patients, 6 (8.1%) in the nail brace group and 8 (9.4%) in the Winograd technique group developed recurrence; however, this difference was not statistically significant (p > .05). A statistically significant difference was observed in the mean interval to recurrence (12.46 ± 1.60 versus 13.24 ± 2.48 months, respectively; p = .031). The progression-free follow-up periods for the nail brace and Winograd technique groups were 15.45 ± 0.22 months (95% confidence interval 15.02 to 15.88) and 17.18 ± 0.29 months (95% confidence interval 16.61 to 17.84), respectively. We have concluded that the use of nail braces is an appropriate alternative treatment of ingrown toenails with high patient satisfaction, fast recovery times, and a low recurrence rate.

### The role of ingrown hairs in persistent kerion of children: a clinical study [^114xzbSn]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Integrating the discussion with our clinical experience, we conclude that ingrown hairs, arising from fungal infections, play a role in the dissemination of infection and the development of resistance to treatment. Several parts are involved: the abnormal structural traits predispose to ingrown hairs formation, facilitating the local spread of pathogens through subcutaneous and transcutaneous penetration. This process effectively "reimplants" the affected hairs in an erroneous growth trajectory, contrary to the natural. At the same time, it can be viewed as "primary infectious foreign bodies", which intensifies local inflammation, leading to the formation of secondary lesions and hindering the penetration of antifungal agents to the site of infection. Within this process, ingrown hairs act as a potential fungal reservoir due to their unique location and the inflammatory milieu, thereby impeding the efficacy of conventional systemic antifungal treatments.

A minor surgical procedure involving the use of a dermatoscope and sterile instruments to locate and remove ingrown hairs containing fungal elements offers a straightforward and cost‐effective treatment option, particularly for patients whose conditions persist or worsen under conventional therapy, as in our cases. This method can decrease the fungal burden, facilitate the identification of secondary lesions, and circumvent the potential side effects associated with prolonged systemic antifungal treatment, including liver dysfunction and systemic adverse reactions. The definition of "ingrown hairs" should encompass a broader spectrum of conditions, extending beyond PFB or creeping hair to specific cases associated with specific causes, including fungal infections or other acute inflammations.

To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the link between ingrown hairs and fungal infections, suggesting that early detection and removal of ingrown hairs has considerable curative effects on persistent kerion. Nonetheless, large sample research is required to assess the similarities and differences associated with ingrown hairs among different cases. Specifically, examining the overall efficacy of the "removal treatment" and developing standardized protocols might enhance our current understanding and approach to kerion treatment.

### Best evidence topic report. are antibiotics indicated following human bites? [^115uMrnS]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

A short cut review was carried out to establish whether antibiotics are indicated for human bites. Eighty nine papers were found using the reported search, of which two represent the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results, and study weaknesses of these best papers are tabulated. Prophylactic antibiotics should be given to all patients with human bites to the hands, feet, and skin overlying joints or cartilaginous structures, and to all patients with bites that penetrate deeper than the epidermal layer.

### Best way to treat an ingrown toenail [^111pCpA4]. Dermatologic Clinics (2015). Low credibility.

Nail phenolization is considered a useful procedure for treating ingrowing toenails. Nail phenolization is indicated when partial and definitive removal of the nail plate is necessary. Nail phenolization is simple and inexpensive, and associated with little postoperative discomfort, a quick return to normal activities, and a low rate of complication and recurrence. The Howard-Dubois and super U techniques are indicated when ingrowing nails are caused by hypertrophy of nail folds, according to the degree of severity.

### Osteomyelitis of the foot and toe in adults is a surgical disease: conservative management worsens lower extremity salvage [^115EvMVo]. Annals of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To characterize the national epidemiology of adult osteomyelitis (OM) and, using a single institutions' experience, test the hypothesis that early surgical therapy as compared with antibiotics alone results in an improved chance of wound healing and limb salvage.

Background

Foot and digit OM is a very common problem for which management is variable and for which few guidelines exist.

Methods

The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) and a single institution review from 1993 to 2000 form the basis of this study, using ICD-9CM codes for lower extremity foot and digit OM. Demographics, risk factors, and treatments were analyzed against the outcomes of a healed wound, limb salvage, and death.

Results

The NIS included 51,875 patients (incidence = 9/10,000 patients per year) with a mean age of 60 years, and 59% were men. The median length of stay decreased from 9 to 6 days (P < 0.001), but the average admission charge of 19,000 dollars did not significantly decrease over 7 years. Of these patients, 23% underwent a digit amputation and 8.5% suffered proximal limb loss. Single-institution analysis of 237 consecutive patients with OM confirmed a similar mean age (58 years), gender (67% men), and most presented with a foot or digit ulcer (56%). Wound healing was achieved in 56% and overall limb salvage was 80%. Decreased wound healing was associated with peripheral vascular occlusive disease (odds ratio, 0.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.2–0.8, P = 0.006) and preadmission antibiotic use (odds ratio, 0.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.05–1.1, P = 0.07), while surgical debridement (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.2–4.2, P = 0.02) was associated with increased healing. Limb salvage was improved with an arterial bypass (odds ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–14, P = 0.04), while preadmission solid organ transplant (odds ratio, 0.37; 95% confidence interval, 0.14–0.96, P = 0.04), peripheral vascular occlusive disease (odds ratio, 0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.12–0.5, P = 0.001), and preadmission antibiotic use (odds ratio, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.15–0.77, P = 0.009) were associated with greater limb loss.

Conclusion

Digit OM is an expensive and morbid disease. Aggressive surgical debridement/digit amputation and selected use of arterial bypass should improve wound healing and limb salvage, respectively. In contrast, antibiotic therapy alone is associated with decreased wound healing and limb salvage.

### Nail-fold excision for the treatment of ingrown toenail in children [^116cPoUn]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of the nail-fold excision procedure in children.

Study Design

Prospectively collected data on patients less than 18 years of age who underwent a nail-fold excision for symptomatic ingrown toenail were analyzed. Patients were seen in 2 centers and data collected included demographics, site of ingrown toenail, complications (including recurrence), patient satisfaction, and duration of follow-up.

Results

Overall, 67 procedures were performed on 50 patients between June 2009 and July 2011 at the 2 institutions. The mean age was 14 years (range, 9–18 years) and 30 were male patients. No recurrences were seen after a follow-up for a median of 14 months (range 6–28 months). Patients were very satisfied with the cosmetic outcomes. Six minor complications occurred, including 3 patients with bleeding requiring dressing change, 2 with excessive granulation tissue, and 1 with nail growth abnormality.

Conclusions

The nail-fold excision technique is highly effective in the pediatric population, with no recurrence, excellent cosmesis, and very high patient satisfaction.

### Topical therapy for toenail onychomycosis: an evidence-based review [^115uG4C3]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Managing toenail onychomycosis with topical treatments is challenging. It is difficult for topical medication to penetrate the nail plate, and this is reflected in lower cure rates with topical treatment than with oral treatment. However, oral medications may not be suitable for some patients, because of drug interactions; therefore, topical treatments are critical in managing the disease in certain patient populations.

Objective

This paper reviews the quality and content of the scientific literature on topical treatments for toenail onychomycosis.

Methods

PubMed, Ovid (Medline and Embase), Scopus, Cochrane library, and clinicaltrials.gov databases were searched for original clinical reports of topical monotherapy for microscopy and/or culture-confirmed toenail onychomycosis in adults. Studies were evaluated using an onychomycosis study quality scale, which was based on the CONSORT guidelines.

Results

Twenty-five publications (28 studies) were identified and met the inclusion criteria. Thirteen studies scored high ratings on the quality scale. These were randomized controlled trials or randomized comparative trials. Low-quality studies were nonrandomized, open studies that prevented statistical analysis. Most studies reported clinical and mycological cure. The most variation was observed with reporting outcomes of clinical improvement. Amorolfine, ciclopirox, tavaborole, and efinaconazole produced clinical and mycological cure in patients with mild to moderate toenail onychomycosis (< 50–65% nail involvement), with efinaconazole showing the highest rates. Treatments were generally applied daily for 24–48 weeks, with longer treatment and follow-up showing better outcomes.

Conclusion

Topical treatment with amorolfine, ciclopirox, tavaborole, or efinaconazole is appropriate for cases of mild to moderate toenail onychomycosis due to dermatophyte or mixed dermatophyte/Candida infection.

### Toxic side effects of targeted therapies and immunotherapies affecting the skin, oral mucosa, hair, and nails [^113DyHcN]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Nail Toxicities

Nail Toxicities of Targeted Therapies

Targeted therapies may cause damage to nail folds, with paronychia and periungual pyogenic granuloma distinct from chemotherapy-induced lesions (Fig. 4 a, b) that are mostly observed in the nail plate or the nail matrix. As some patients may receive both treatment types combined, clinicians must be fully informed of differences between chemotherapy and targeted therapy-associated nail toxicities. Paronychia and periungual granulomas are mostly reported in response to EGFRIs, with a 17.2% all-grade toxicity incidence, as well as MEKIs and mTOR inhibitors to a lesser extent. Typical lesions, which mostly affect toenails or thumbs, develop slowly after several weeks or months of treatment. Damage typically starts with the development of periungual inflammatory paronychia and can evolve into overgrowing of friable granulation tissue on lateral and/or proximal nail folds, mimicking ingrown nails. Although usually not severe, such lesions can still be very debilitating for the patient, especially when they persist for a long time. Therefore, aggressive strategies must be implemented to help patients cope with these adverse effects. The standard of care for pyogenic granuloma is surgery with partial removal of the nail plate and matrix and physical destruction of the granulation tissue and phenolization. In patients with multiple concomitant lesions, conservative treatment should be prioritized, with supportive oncodermatology while maintaining targeted therapy. In close collaboration with a podiatrist, nail curvature can be corrected if needed. Stretchable tape, liquid nitrogen, a combination of topical corticosteroids and antibiotics, antiseptic soaks, and silver nitrate can also be used. Topical timolol can also be helpful for periungual pyogenic granuloma.

Sixty-six patients with 225 ingrown nail edges were treated in three groups receiving 30-second, 1-minute, and 2-minute applications of sodium hydroxide. Each patient was reviewed postoperatively for pain, drainage, and tissue damage. The median long-term follow-up period was 14 months.

Results

The success rate of the therapy was 70.9% in the first group, 92.7% in the second group, and 94.4% in the third group. In all groups, about half of the patients experienced minimal pain within 48 hours following the operation, but only in the third group, 20% of the patients had minimal pain, which continued about 1 week. Drainage and tissue damage were minimal or mild in all groups and disappeared within 3 weeks in the first and second groups but were prolonged to 6 weeks in the third group.

Conclusion

The success rate of 30-second application is significantly lower than 1-minute and 2-minute applications. Although the success rates of the latter two procedures are similar, the prolonged healing time is the disadvantage of the 2-minute application. We conclude that 1-minute application of 10% sodium hydroxide is simple, safe, and highly effective for the treatment of ingrown nails.

### Surgical treatment of ingrown toenail without matricectomy [^114vFStb]. Dermatologic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Partial excision of the nail matrix (matricectomy) is generally considered necessary in the surgical treatment of ingrown toenail. Recurrences may occur, however, and poor cosmetic results are frequently observed.

Objective

The objective is to present a new surgical procedure for ingrown toenail with complete preservation of the nail matrix.

Methods

Twenty-three patients with ingrown toenail were included in this study. The surgical excision was performed 1 week after the completion of treatment of the initial infection. A large volume of soft tissue surrounding the nail plate was removed under local anesthesia. No matrix excision was performed.

Results

Short-term results were excellent. No recurrences or severe complications were observed during the minimum 12-months follow-up period. Cosmetic results were remarkable.

Conclusions

Ingrown toenail results from the compression of the lateral nail folds on the nail plate. This study shows that ingrown toenail can be surgically treated without matricectomy. A large volume of soft tissue surrounding the nail plate should be removed to decompress the nail and reduce inflammation. Cosmetic results are excellent and superior to the classical Emmert plasty. Postoperative nail dystrophies and spicule formation are not observed. The main advantage of this surgical approach is the complete preservation of the anatomy and function of the nail to improve both therapeutic and cosmetic results.

### Patient-controlled taping for the treatment of ingrown toenails [^113vyH82]. Annals of Family Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Various methods are used to treat ingrown or pincer-like toenails. We developed a novel taping method to prevent topical interruption of the circulation and resulting skin conditions and evaluated it over 14.5 years. We instructed 541 patients or their guardians in the use of the technique. Ingrown toenail symptoms and abnormal nail growth were resolved and no additional therapy was required in 276 patients. The novel taping method was significantly more effective than treatments our patients had received previously. Patient-controlled taping is the first-line treatment for every ingrown or curved toenail seen in our clinic.

### Diabetic foot infections: current treatment and delaying the 'post-antibiotic era' [^113UTJvi]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment for diabetic foot infections requires properly diagnosing infection, obtaining an appropriate specimen for culture, assessing for any needed surgical procedures and selecting an empiric antibiotic regimen. Therapy will often need to be modified based on results of culture and sensitivity testing. Because of excessive and inappropriate use of antibiotics for treating diabetic foot infections, resistance to the usually employed bacteria has been increasing to alarming levels.

Review

This article reviews recommendations from evidence-based guidelines, informed by results of systematic reviews, on treating diabetic foot infections. Data from the pre-antibiotic era reported rates of mortality of about 9% and of high-level leg amputations of about 70%. Outcomes have greatly improved with appropriate antibiotic therapy. While there are now many oral and parenteral antibiotic agents that have demonstrated efficacy in treating diabetic foot infections, the rate of infection with multidrug-resistant pathogens is growing. This problem requires a multi-focal approach, including providing education to both clinicians and patients, developing robust antimicrobial stewardship programmes and using new diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. Recently, new methods have been developed to find novel antibiotic agents and to resurrect old treatments, like bacteriophages, for treating these difficult infections.

Conclusion

Medical and political leaders have recognized the serious global threat posed by the growing problem of antibiotic resistance. By a multipronged approach that includes exerting administrative pressure on clinicians to do the right thing, investing in new technologies and encouraging the profitable development of new antimicrobials, we may be able to stave off the coming 'post-antibiotic era'.

### A modified heifetz method with a new suture technique in the surgical treatment of ingrown toenails [^1137AuKM]. Dermatologic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Ingrown toenail (onychocryptosis) is a common condition causing pain, inflammation, and functional impairment. Various surgical techniques exist, but recurrence and cosmetic outcomes remain concerns.

Objective

This study evaluates the modified Heifetz method, incorporating a novel suturing technique, in comparison with the classical Heifetz method regarding recurrence rates, cosmetic satisfaction, and postoperative pain.

Methods

A retrospective analysis was conducted on 214 patients, 104 treated with the classical Heifetz method and 110 with the modified method. Primary outcomes included recurrence rates, cosmetic satisfaction, pain levels, and time to return to activity.

Results

Recurrence rates were significantly lower in the modified Heifetz group (2.7% vs 10.6%, p = .020). Cosmetic satisfaction was higher (96.4% vs 78.8%, p = .001), and postoperative pain was lower (visual analog scale: 0.06 ± 0.31 vs 0.76 ± 1.05, p = .001). Patients treated with the modified method returned to daily activities sooner (21.16 ± 10.78 vs 23.49 ± 9.58 days, p = .039).

Conclusion

The modified Heifetz method provides superior cosmetic outcomes, lower recurrence rates, and reduced postoperative pain, making it a viable alternative to the classical method.

### Partial matricectomy with curettage and electrocautery: a comparison of two surgical methods in the treatment of ingrown toenails [^114Wo2gu]. Dermatologic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

An ingrown toenail is a common, painful, and debilitating condition.

Objective

This study aims to compare 2 surgical methods (partial matricectomy with curettage and electrocautery) in the treatment of ingrown toenails.

Materials and Methods

A total of 92 ingrown nails of the big toe in 86 patients underwent partial matricectomy with curettage, whereas 57 ingrown nails of the big toe in 52 patients underwent partial matricectomy with electrocautery.

Results

Recurrence was observed in 2 toenails in the partial matricectomy with curettage group, whereas no recurrence was observed in the partial matricectomy with electrocautery group (p > .05). The mean period of postoperative pain was 2.3 and 3.1 days in the curettage group and the electrocautery group, respectively (p < .05). There was a significant difference in the duration of scar tissue inflammation (p < .05).

Conclusion

Both surgical methods are safe treatment modalities with a high success rate. Partial matricectomy, which is achieved using curettage, seems to be superior to electrocautery in respect of reduced inflammation and duration of pain.

### Comparison of phenol and sodium hydroxide chemical matricectomies for the treatment of ingrowing toenails [^114ah14F]. Dermatologic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Chemical matricectomy is performed mainly by two agents: phenol and sodium hydroxide. Both agents have excellent cure rates, but there are no data about the comparison of postoperative healing periods. This study was designed to compare the postoperative morbidity rates of sodium hydroxide and phenol matricectomies.

Materials and Methods

Forty-six patients with 154 ingrowing nail sides were treated with either sodium hydroxide or phenol matricectomy. In the postoperative period, the patients were evaluated for the duration and severity of pain, drainage, and peripheral tissue destruction; complete healing periods; and overall success rates.

Results

The incidence of pain was higher in the sodium hydroxide group on the first visit, on the second day, but all patients became pain-free after that. The incidence and duration of drainage and peripheral tissue destruction was significantly higher in the phenol group. The mean period for complete recovery was 10.8 days in the sodium hydroxide group, whereas it was 18.02 days in the phenol group. The overall success rates in the sodium hydroxide and phenol groups were found to be 95.1 and 95.8%, respectively.

Conclusion

Both sodium hydroxide and phenol are effective agents giving high success rates, but sodium hydroxide causes less postoperative morbidity and provides faster recovery.

### Surgical treatments for ingrowing toenails [^111Kv3hs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Ingrowing toenails are a common condition which, when recurrent and painful, are often treated surgically.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of methods of the surgical treatment of ingrowing toenails.

Search Strategy

Electronic database searching (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL) followed by investigation of reference lists of the papers identified from the initial search.

Selection Criteria

Any randomised (or quasi-randomised) controlled trial which compares one form of surgical removal of all or part of a toenail due to its impact on the soft tissues to another or others. Studies must have a minimum follow period of six months and aim to permanently remove the troublesome portion of the nail.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction was carried out independently by the two reviewers using a pre-derived data extraction form and entered into RevMan. Categorical outcomes were analysed as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals.

Main Results

Avulsion with phenol versus surgical excision: Phenolisation combined with simple avulsion of a nail is more effective than the use of more invasive excisional surgical procedures to prevent symptomatic recurrence at six months or more (OR 0.44 CI 95% 0.24–0.80). Avulsion with phenol versus avulsion without phenol: The addition of phenol, when performing a total or partial nail avulsion dramatically reduces the rate of symptomatic recurrence, (OR 0.07 95% CI 0.04–0.12). This is offset by a significant increase in the rate of post-operative infection when phenol is used (OR 5.69 95% CI 1.93–16.77).

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence suggests that simple nail avulsion combined with the use of phenol, compared to surgical excisional techniques without the use of phenol, is more effective at preventing symptomatic recurrence of ingrowing toenails. The addition of phenol when simple nail avulsion is performed dramatically decreases symptomatic recurrence, but at the cost of increased post-operative infection.

### Topical treatments for fungal infections of the skin and nails of the foot [^111khEPs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Fungal infections of the feet normally occur in the outermost layer of the skin (epidermis). The skin between the toes is a frequent site of infection which can cause pain and itchiness. Fungal infections of the nail (onychomycosis) can affect the entire nail plate.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical treatments in successfully treating (rate of treatment failure) fungal infections of the skin of the feet and toenails and in preventing recurrence.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (January 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE and EMBASE (from inception to January 2005). We screened the Science Citation Index, BIOSIS, CAB - Health and Healthstar, CINAHL DARE, NHS Economic Evaluation Database and EconLit (March 2005). Bibliographies were searched.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using participants who had mycologically diagnosed fungal infections of the skin and nails of the foot.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently summarised the included trials and appraised their quality of reporting using a structured data extraction tool.

Main Results

Of the 144 identified papers, 67 trials met the inclusion criteria. Placebo-controlled trials yielded the following pooled risk ratios (RR) of treatment failure for skin infections: allylamines RR 0.33 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.44); azoles RR 0.30 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.45); ciclopiroxolamine RR 0.27 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.66); tolnaftate RR 0.19 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.44); butenafine RR 0.33 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.45); undecanoates RR 0.29 (95% CI 0.12–0.70). Meta-analysis of 11 trials comparing allylamines and azoles showed a risk ratio of treatment failure RR 0.63 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.94) in favour of allylamines. Evidence for the management of topical treatments for infections of the toenails is sparser. There is some evidence that ciclopiroxolamine and butenafine are both effective but they both need to be applied daily for prolonged periods (at least 1 year). The 6 trials of nail infections provided evidence that topical ciclopiroxolamine has poor cure rates and that amorolfine might be substantially more effective but more research is required.

Authors' Conclusions

Placebo-controlled trials of allylamines and azoles for athlete's foot consistently produce much higher percentages of cure than placebo. Allylamines cure slightly more infections than azoles and are now available OTC. Further research into the effectiveness of antifungal agents for nail infections is required.

### Topical brimonidine for pyogenic granuloma after paronychia surgery [^111Szh74]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Brimonidine, a highly selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist, is widely used for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The topical application of brimonidine gel may reduce facial erythema by inducing cutaneous vasoconstriction of rosacea. Brimonidine, with the characteristics of rapid metabolism and systemic clearance, has no significant affects on the heart rate and blood pressure. However, some medicines, such as tricyclic antidepressants or monoamine oxidase inhibitors, may influence brimonidine's metabolism.

The etiology of paronychia mainly includes an ingrown toenail, trauma, and infection. Surgery is an effective method to treat paronychia, but complications such as PG cannot be avoided, especially if postoperative infection occurs. PG is a disorder of benign vascular proliferation, with rapidly growing erythematous nodules developing into pedunculated tumors that may be subject to erosion and bleeding. The exact pathogenic mechanism is not fully clear and has been associated with trauma, infection, foreign body reactions, pregnancy, immunosuppression, several drugs, and delayed wound healing. The current available treatment options include topical or systemic pharmacotherapies, silver nitrate, surgical intervention, semi-invasive therapies, laser, and others. In terms of topical pharmacotherapies, beta blockers, such as timolol or propranolol, toll-like receptor 7 agonists, such as imiquimod, and other medicines are available. Overall, the relapse rate of PG is about 4.56%; surgical excision among the surgical management options is the most effective method, with a lower recurrence rate (2.94%) compared with nonsurgical treatments (3.67%), including cryotherapy, laser, liquid nitrogen refrigeration, and topical pharmacotherapies.

### Topical and device-based treatments for fungal infections of the toenails [^1127Qx9o]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis refers to fungal infections of the nail apparatus that may cause pain, discomfort, and disfigurement. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2007; a substantial amount of new research warrants a review exclusively on toenails.

Objectives

To assess the clinical and mycological effects of topical drugs and device-based therapies for toenail onychomycosis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers, and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of topical and device-based therapies for onychomycosis in participants with toenail onychomycosis, confirmed by positive cultures, direct microscopy, or histological nail examination. Eligible comparators were placebo, vehicle, no treatment, or an active topical or device-based treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were complete cure rate (normal-looking nail plus fungus elimination, determined with laboratory methods) and number of participants reporting treatment-related adverse events.

Main Results

We included 56 studies (12,501 participants, average age: 27 to 68 years), with mainly mild-to-moderate onychomycosis without matrix involvement (where reported). Participants had more than one toenail affected. Most studies lasted 48 to 52 weeks; 23% reported disease duration (variable). Thirty-five studies specifically examined dermatophyte-caused onychomycosis. Forty-three studies were carried out in outpatient settings. Most studies assessed topical treatments, 9% devices, and 11% both. We rated three studies at low risk of bias across all domains. The most common high-risk domain was performance bias. We present results for key comparisons, where treatment duration was 36 or 48 weeks, and clinical outcomes were measured at 40 to 52 weeks. Based on two studies (460 participants), compared with vehicle, ciclopirox 8% lacquer may be more effective in achieving complete cure (risk ratio (RR) 9.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.72 to 50.14; low-quality evidence) and is probably more effective in achieving mycological cure (RR 3.15, 95% CI 1.93 to 5.12; moderate-quality evidence). Ciclopirox lacquer may lead to increased adverse events, commonly application reactions, rashes, and nail alteration (e.g. colour, shape). However, the 95% CI indicates that ciclopirox lacquer may actually make little or no difference (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.92; low-quality evidence). Efinaconazole 10% solution is more effective than vehicle in achieving complete cure (RR 3.54, 95% CI 2.24 to 5.60; 3 studies, 1716 participants) and clinical cure (RR 3.07, 95% CI 2.08 to 4.53; 2 studies, 1655 participants) (both high-quality evidence) and is probably more effective in achieving mycological cure (RR 2.31, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.94; 3 studies, 1716 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Risk of adverse events (such as dermatitis and vesicles) was slightly higher with efinaconazole (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.20; 3 studies, 1701 participants; high-quality evidence). No other key comparison measured clinical cure. Based on two studies, compared with vehicle, tavaborole 5% solution is probably more effective in achieving complete cure (RR 7.40, 95% CI 2.71 to 20.24; 1198 participants), but probably has a higher risk of adverse events (application site reactions were most commonly reported) (RR 3.82, 95% CI 1.65 to 8.85; 1186 participants (both moderate-quality evidence)). Tavaborole improves mycological cure (RR 3.40, 95% CI 2.34 to 4.93; 1198 participants; high-quality evidence). Moderate-quality evidence from two studies (490 participants) indicates that P-3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) is probably more effective than the comparators ciclopirox 8% lacquer or amorolfine 5% in achieving complete cure (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.32 to 4.48), but there is probably little or no difference between the treatments in achieving mycological cure (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.37). We found no difference in the risk of adverse events (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.92; 2 studies, 487 participants; low-quality evidence). The most common events were erythema, rash, and burning. Three studies (112 participants) compared 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser to no treatment or sham treatment. We are uncertain if there is a difference in adverse events (very low-quality evidence) (two studies; 85 participants). There may be little or no difference in mycological cure at 52 weeks (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.85; 2 studies, 85 participants; low-quality evidence). Complete cure was not measured. One study (293 participants) compared luliconazole 5% solution to vehicle. We are uncertain whether luliconazole leads to higher rates of complete cure (very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates there may be little or no difference in adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.16) and there may be increased mycological cure with luliconazole; however, the 95% CI indicates that luliconazole may make little or no difference to mycological cure (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.97). Commonly-reported adverse events were dry skin, paronychia, eczema, and hyperkeratosis, which improved or resolved post-treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Assessing complete cure, high-quality evidence supports the effectiveness of efinaconazole, moderate-quality evidence supports P-3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) and tavaborole, and low-quality evidence supports ciclopirox 8% lacquer. We are uncertain whether luliconazole 5% solution leads to complete cure (very low-quality evidence); this outcome was not measured by the 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser comparison. Although evidence supports topical treatments, complete cure rates with topical treatments are relatively low. We are uncertain if 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser increases adverse events compared with no treatment or sham treatment (very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates that there is no difference in adverse events between P-3051 (ciclopirox hydrolacquer), luliconazole 5% solution, and their comparators. Ciclopirox 8% lacquer may increase adverse events (low-quality evidence). High- to moderate-quality evidence suggests increased adverse events with efinaconazole 10% solution or tavaborole 5% solution. We downgraded evidence for heterogeneity, lack of blinding, and small sample sizes. There is uncertainty about the effectiveness of device-based treatments, which were under-represented; 80% of studies assessed topical treatments, but we were unable to evaluate all of the currently relevant topical treatments. Future studies of topical and device-based therapies should be blinded, with patient-centred outcomes and an adequate sample size. They should specify the causative organism and directly compare treatments.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

In two clinical trials, 1227 subjects were treated with JUBLIA, 1161 for at least 24 weeks and 780 for 48 weeks. Adverse reactions reported within 48 weeks of treatment and in at least 1% of subjects treated with JUBLIA and those reported in subjects treated with the vehicle are presented in Table 1.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of JUBLIA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Application site erythema and exfoliation

Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Onychomadesis, Nail discoloration

### Comparison of wedge resection (winograd procedure) and wedge resection plus complete nail plate avulsion in the treatment of ingrown toenails [^11792HvA]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The present retrospective study compared the efficacy of wedge resection (Winograd procedure) and wedge resection plus complete nail plate avulsion for the treatment of ingrown toenails (onychocryptosis). Two surgical methods were performed in 95 patients with a stage 2 or 3 ingrown toenail. Each patient was examined weekly until healing and then at 1, 6, and 12 months of follow-up. The outcomes measured were surgical duration, healing time, recurrence rate, the incidence of postoperative infection, and cosmetic appearance after surgery. Of the 95 patients (115 ingrown toenails) included in the present study, 39 (41.1%) underwent wedge resection (Winograd procedure) and 56 (59%), wedge resection plus complete nail plate avulsion. The mean surgical duration for wedge resection (Winograd procedure) and wedge resection plus complete nail plate avulsion was 14.9 ± 2.4 minutes and 15.1 ± 3.2 minutes, respectively (p = .73). The corresponding healing times were 2.8 ± 1.2 weeks and 2.7 ± 1.3 weeks (p = .70). Recurrence developed in 3 (3.2%) patients after wedge resection (Winograd procedure) and in 4 (4.2%) after wedge resection plus complete nail plate avulsion. In addition, postoperative infection occurred in 3 (3.2%) patients after wedge resection (Winograd procedure) and 2 (2.1%) after wedge resection plus complete nail plate avulsion. Both of the surgical procedures were practical and appropriate for the treatment of ingrown toenails, being simple and associated with low morbidity and a high success rate. However, cosmetically, wedge resection (Winograd procedure) would be the better choice because the nail plate remains intact.

### Tavaborole topical solution, 5% (tavaborole) [^11459Mci]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

- Use tavaborole topical solution exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to use it.

- Apply tavaborole topical solution to your affected toenails 1 time each day.

- Tavaborole topical solution is used for 48 weeks.

- It is not known if the use of nail polish or other cosmetic nail products (such as gel nails or acrylic nails) will affect how tavaborole topical solution works.

What should I avoid while using tavaborole topical solution?

- Tavaborole topical solution is flammable. Avoid heat and flame while applying tavaborole topical solution to your toenail.

What are the possible side effects of tavaborole topical solution?

The most common side effects of tavaborole topical solution include: skin peeling, ingrown toenail, redness, itching, and swelling.

Tavaborole topical solution may cause irritation at or near the application site. Tell your healthcare provider if you develop irritation at the application site that does not go away. These are not all of the possible side effects of tavaborole topical solution.

Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1–800-FDA-1088.

### A simple, pain-free treatment for ingrown toenails complicated with granulation tissue [^113ZYGLT]. Dermatologic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The treatment of ingrown toenail complicated with granulation tissue is usually partial or total nail avulsion with or without matricectomy. It costs loss of occupational power, however, because most patients cannot go to work or school for some time after surgery, and it is a costly and uncomfortable procedure for most patients.

Objective

This study aimed to find an easy, painless, and inexpensive alternative.

Materials and Methods

Seven patients with ingrown toenails complicated with granulation tissue are included. A small apparatus was applied on the nails, granulation tissue was chemically cauterized, and a foot bath was recommended twice daily. They were followed on a weekly basis or every other week until recovery. None of the patients received systemic treatment.

Results

All seven patients were completely cured without requiring surgery and/or systemic treatment. The procedure did not have any effect on their daily life. The follow-up examination of the patients at 6 months revealed that they were totally cured, and there were no recurrences.

Conclusion

Patients with ingrown toenails complicated by granulation tissue might have an inexpensive and pain-free treatment alternative, although new studies with more patients are required.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114NgcMq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis — local care and disposition state that elevation of the affected area and treatment of predisposing factors, such as edema or underlying cutaneous disorders, are recommended (strong, moderate). In lower-extremity cellulitis, clinicians should carefully examine the interdigital toe spaces because treating fissuring, scaling, or maceration may eradicate colonization with pathogens and reduce the incidence of recurrent infection (strong, moderate). Outpatient therapy is recommended for patients who do not have SIRS, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability (mild nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate), and hospitalization is recommended if there is concern for a deeper or necrotizing infection, for patients with poor adherence to therapy, for infection in a severely immunocompromised patient, or if outpatient treatment is failing (moderate or severe nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate).

### Ingrown toenail removal [^117QoDGr]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Ingrown toenail is a common problem resulting from various etiologies including improperly trimmed nails, hyperhidrosis, and poorly fitting shoes. Patients commonly present with pain in the affected nail but with progression, drainage, infection, and difficulty walking occur. Excision of the lateral nail plate combined with lateral matricectomy is thought to provide the best chance for eradication. The lateral aspect of the nail plate is removed with preservation of the remaining healthy nail plate. Electrocautery ablation is then used to destroy the exposed nail-forming matrix, creating a new lateral nail fold. Complications of the procedure include regrowth of a nail spicule secondary to incomplete matricectomy and postoperative nail bed infection. When performed correctly, the procedure produces the greatest success in the treatment of ingrown nails. Basic soft tissue surgery and electrosurgery experience are prerequisites for learning the technique.

### How should fungal nail infection be treated? [^112NwjGH]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

Many people consulting dermatologists for nail problems have a fungal nail infection (onychomycosis). This may be asymptomatic and not merit prolonged treatment, particularly since relapse after such intervention is common. On the other hand, fungal nail infection is sometimes a treatable risk factor for more serious bacterial infections including cellulitis. Here we discuss the management of adults with fungal nail infection.

### Congenital ingrown toenail of the hallux [^112rikQx]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Ingrown toenail in the infant is a rare entity that has only occasionally been discussed in the medical literature. At birth, or soon thereafter, children present with bilateral ingrown hallux toenails notable for pain, tenderness, erythema, purulence, and hypertrophy of the skin and fat of the distal end of the great toes extending over the dorsum of the nail plates. Inflammatory and infectious granulation tissue develops with time.

Methods

We present a case series of 4 patients with bilateral congenitally ingrown hallux toenails. Conservative and surgical treatment modalities were used, with 3 of 4 patients undergoing wedge resection of the hypertrophic soft tissues at the distal end of the toes.

Results

There were excellent results in both feet of all patients with resolution of the condition and no recurrences in any patient. Clinical photos are provided for all patients.

Conclusions

Ingrown toenail in the infant is a rare entity that occasionally requires surgical treatment. Excellent results are expected with wedge resection of the hypertrophic soft tissues.

### Lower limb cellulitis and its mimics: part I. lower limb cellulitis [^115JcYR7]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

An aging population and obesity have both contributed to a rising incidence of lower limb cellulitis; the most important predisposing factors include older age, obesity, venous insufficiency, saphenous venectomy, and edema. Streptococci are the most commonly implicated pathogen, and often reside in the interdigital toes spaces. Any disruption of the skin surface can allow the organism to invade. Effective management requires an appropriate antibiotic and attention to the predisposing factors. This article summarizes the epidemiology and treatment of this common infection.

### Fungal toenail infections [^112Wkie1]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fungal infections are reported to cause 23% of foot diseases and 50% of nail conditions in people seen by dermatologists, but are less common in the general population, affecting 3–5% of people.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of oral treatments for fungal toenail infections? What are the effects of topical treatments for fungal toenail infections? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 11 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: amorolfine, butenafine, ciclopirox, fluconazole, griseofulvin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, mechanical debridement, terbinafine, and tioconazole.

### Efinaconazole in onychomycosis [^117MY5gB]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal nail infection that causes nail discoloration, nail plate thickening, and onycholysis. Efinaconazole 10% topical solution is an FDA-approved treatment for onychomycosis patients aged 6 years and above. The drug functions as an antifungal by disrupting ergosterol synthesis in the fungal cell membrane. It exhibits higher in vitro activity against dermatophytes than other available antifungals such as ciclopirox and itraconazole, and the activity is comparable to amorolfine and terbinafine. Efinaconazole also provides enhanced nail penetration compared with other topical antifungals due to low surface tension, poor water solubility, and low keratin affinity. The pharmacokinetic studies suggest that the efinaconazole topical delivery to the nail bed is not markedly affected by the presence of disease. There is a subset of onychomycosis patients who are more likely to respond to efinaconazole 10% solution: female patients, those with lower BMI, mild onychomycosis, a short disease duration, no infected non-target toenails (large toenail disease only), and when concomitant tinea pedis is treated. Experts recommend efinaconazole 10% topical solution as the first line for mild-to-moderate onychomycosis, pediatric onychomycosis, those with liver or kidney disease, and as maintenance therapy to prevent relapse. The side effects of topical efinaconazole are minimal: most commonly ingrown toenails, dermatitis, vesicles, and pain at the application site. Altogether, phase I and phase III clinical trials, and post-hoc analyses indicate that efinaconazole 10% topical solution is a safe and effective treatment for adult and pediatric onychomycosis, with a satisfactory mycological and clinical cure.

### Exploring postoperative outcomes for ingrown toenails. NaOH vs wedge resection techniques [^113BPYq9]. Dermatologic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Ingrown (or ingrowing) toenail is a commonly used term for onychocryptosis, in which the nail becomes inserted into the lateral fold of the toe. The resulting effect on a person's health, well-being, and ability to work suggests the importance of clear treatment guidance, but little consensus exists.

Objective

To explore postoperative recovery after surgery for ingrown toenails using chemical (sodium hydroxide (NaOH)) or mechanical (wedge resection) matricectomy and thus contribute to understanding within the field on which to base treatment guidelines.

Methods

One hundred sixty-one procedures were undertaken, 94 using NaOH and 67 using wedge resection. Four measures of postoperative recovery were recorded: recurrence, infection, time to discharge, and number of postoperative visits.

Results

Patients treated with NaOH had lower rates of recurrence (p = .048) and infection (p = .03) than those treated with wedge resection, and time to discharge was shorter (p = .02), but they had more postoperative visits (p = .003).

Conclusion

Low rates of recurrence and infection and short postoperative recovery time were found after both procedures, with a small advantage with treatment with NaOH. The authors argue for the value of clinical intervention using matricectomy in early stages to avoid complications resulting from granulation tissue growth.

### Evaluation and management of mechanical and structural nail disorders: a clinical review [^1125X1Tu]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Physical trauma is the most common cause of toenail onychodystrophy, surpassing onychomycosis. Ill-fitting footwear and anatomical foot/toe abnormalities, including Morton's toe, hallux valgus/erectus/rigidus, and flat and splay foot, predispose the forefoot to nonphysiologic strain and toenail alterations, often resembling onychomycosis. Dystrophic toenails should therefore be assessed alongside foot and toe alignment while standing and walking, with close examination of footwear. Trauma-induced onychodystrophy predisposes to secondary onychomycosis, and histopathological/mycological confirmation is needed. Moreover, anatomic foot/toe abnormalities may worsen nail psoriasis through koebnerization. Thus, toenails may still appear dystrophic after treating comorbid conditions if the precipitating factor is not addressed or cannot be successfully treated. Additional nail disorders induced by mechanical trauma include subungual heloma, onychophosis, frictional onycholysis, leukonychia, melanonychia, Beau's lines/onychomadesis/retronychia, and disappearing nail bed. Additionally, arthritic conditions affecting the distal interphalangeal joint may theoretically impact the adjacent nail matrix and cause nail alterations. Hyperglycemia, neuropathy, and vasculopathy likely play a role in the pathogenesis of onychodystrophies in patients with diabetes mellitus. Diabetic patients are prone to developing structural foot/toe problems, onychomycosis, and ingrown toenails (onychocryptosis), which increase their risk of ulcer formation. Therefore, treating onychomycosis and onychocryptosis in diabetic patients is crucial to prevent complications, including ulcers, osteomyelitis, and amputations.

### Effectiveness of standard lavage with supplemental chlorhexidine in patients undergoing chemical matricectomy for ingrown toenails: a clinical trial [^113NYiyr]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Phenolization is often used to treat ingrown toenails. Alcohol lavage with or without supplemental chlorhexidine may be used to remove residual phenol, which can contribute to side effects such as persistent oozing or drainage.

Objective

We sought to compare the effectiveness in removing residual phenol of lavage with alcohol plus chlorhexidine versus alcohol alone.

Methods

We studied 80 patients who underwent unilateral phenol matricectomy: 40 who received irrigation with alcohol alone and 40 who received irrigation with alcohol plus chlorhexidine. Phenol levels were measured after each of 5 rounds of 3-mL irrigations.

Results

After the first irrigation, an average of 44.92% and 38.35% of the phenol remained in the nailfold in the alcohol and the alcohol/chlorhexidine groups, respectively (P < .05). After all 5 irrigations, no difference in efficacy between the 2 solutions was found (P > .005).

Limitations

It was not possible to calculate the quantity of phenol initially introduced into the nail bed. The percentage remaining was calculated from the total amount of phenol recovered.

Conclusion

When a single irrigation step is performed after phenolization, alcohol plus chlorhexidine is more effective than alcohol alone for removing residual phenol. When multiple irrigations are performed, the 2 solutions are equally effective.

### Chemical matricectomy with 10% sodium hydroxide for the treatment of ingrown toenails in people with diabetes [^11545M1m]. Dermatologic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of ingrown toenails using chemical matricectomy in patients with diabetes has been difficult, because delayed wound healing, wound infections, and digital ischemia can interfere with the procedure. Chemical matricectomy with 10% sodium hydroxide is an effective treatment for ingrown toenails in a normal population.

Objectives

Investigation of the effectiveness and safety of chemical matricectomy with 10% sodium hydroxide solution for ingrown toenails in patients with diabetes.

Material and Methods

Thirty patients with diabetes with 40 ingrown toenails and 30 patients without diabetes with 41 ingrown toenails were enrolled in the study. After partial avulsion of the affected edge, germinal matrix was treated for 1 minute with 10% sodium hydroxide. Patients were observed on alternate days until complete healing was achieved and followed for up to 24 months for recurrence.

Results

Assessment of the treatment in both groups for complete healing, postoperative pain, tissue damage, drainage, infections, and rate of recurrences revealed no statistically significant difference.

Conclusions

The partial avulsion of the affected edge and the treatment of the germinal matrix for 1 minute with 10% sodium hydroxide preceded by matrix curettage is an effective and safe treatment modality for ingrown toenails in people with diabetes.

### Management of the ingrown toenail [^115rHytV]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Ingrown toenail, or onychocryptosis, most commonly affects the great toenail. Many anatomic and behavioral factors are thought to contribute to ingrown toenails, such as improper trimming, repetitive or inadvertent trauma, genetic predisposition, hyperhidrosis, and poor foot hygiene. Conservative treatment approaches include soaking the foot in warm, soapy water; placing cotton wisps or dental floss under the ingrown nail edge; and gutter splinting with or without the placement of an acrylic nail. Surgical approaches include partial nail avulsion or complete nail excision with or without phenolization. Electrocautery, radiofrequency, and carbon dioxide laser ablation of the nail matrix are also options. Oral antibiotics before or after phenolization do not improve outcomes. Partial nail avulsion followed by either phenolization or direct surgical excision of the nail matrix are equally effective in the treatment of ingrown toenails. Compared with surgical excision of the nail without phenolization, partial nail avulsion combined with phenolization is more effective at preventing symptomatic recurrence of ingrowing toenails, but has a slightly increased risk of postoperative infection.

### Oral antifungal medication for toenail onychomycosis [^113UMTeu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Fungal infection of the toenails, also called onychomycosis, is a common problem that causes damage to the nail's structure and physical appearance. For those severely affected, it can interfere with normal daily activities. Treatment is taken orally or applied topically; however, traditionally topical treatments have low success rates due to the nail's physical properties. Oral treatments also appear to have shorter treatment times and better cure rates. Our review will assist those needing to make an evidence-based choice for treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral antifungal treatments for toenail onychomycosis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to October 2016: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We sought to identify unpublished and ongoing trials by correspondence with authors and by contacting relevant pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

RCTs comparing oral antifungal treatment to placebo or another oral antifungal treatment in participants with toenail onychomycosis, confirmed by one or more positive cultures, direct microscopy of fungal elements, or histological examination of the nail.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 48 studies involving 10,200 participants. Half the studies took place in more than one centre and were conducted in outpatient dermatology settings. The participants mainly had subungual fungal infection of the toenails. Study duration ranged from 4 months to 2 years. We assessed one study as being at low risk of bias in all domains and 18 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain. The most common high-risk domain was 'blinding of personnel and participants'. We found high-quality evidence that terbinafine is more effective than placebo for achieving clinical cure (risk ratio (RR) 6.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.96 to 9.08, 8 studies, 1006 participants) and mycological cure (RR 4.53, 95% CI 2.47 to 8.33, 8 studies, 1006 participants). Adverse events amongst terbinafine-treated participants included gastrointestinal symptoms, infections, and headache, but there was probably no significant difference in their risk between the groups (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.47, 4 studies, 399 participants, moderate-quality evidence). There was high-quality evidence that azoles were more effective than placebo for achieving clinical cure (RR 22.18, 95% CI 12.63 to 38.95, 9 studies, 3440 participants) and mycological cure (RR 5.86, 95% CI 3.23 to 10.62, 9 studies, 3440 participants). There were slightly more adverse events in the azole group (the most common being headache, flu-like symptoms, and nausea), but the difference was probably not significant (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.12; 9 studies, 3441 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Terbinafine and azoles may lower the recurrence rate when compared, individually, to placebo (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.38, 1 study, 35 participants; RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.07, 1 study, 26 participants, respectively; both low-quality evidence). There is moderate-quality evidence that terbinafine was probably more effective than azoles for achieving clinical cure (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95, 15 studies, 2168 participants) and mycological cure (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.88, 17 studies, 2544 participants). There was probably no difference in the risk of adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.17; 9 studies, 1762 participants, moderate-quality evidence) between the two groups, and there may be no difference in recurrence rate (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.79, 5 studies, 282 participants, low-quality evidence). Common adverse events in both groups included headache, viral infection, and nausea. Moderate-quality evidence shows that azoles and griseofulvin probably had similar efficacy for achieving clinical cure (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.96, 5 studies, 222 participants) and mycological cure (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.51, 5 studies, 222 participants). However, the risk of adverse events was probably higher in the griseofulvin group (RR 2.41, 95% CI 1.56 to 3.73, 2 studies, 143 participants, moderate-quality evidence), with the most common being gastrointestinal disturbance and allergic reaction (in griseofulvin-treated participants) along with nausea and vomiting (in azole-treated participants). Very low-quality evidence means we are uncertain about this comparison's impact on recurrence rate (RR 4.00, 0.26 to 61.76, 1 study, 7 participants). There is low-quality evidence that terbinafine may be more effective than griseofulvin in terms of clinical cure (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.72, 4 studies, 270 participants) and mycological cure (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.90, 5 studies, 465 participants), and griseofulvin was associated with a higher risk of adverse events, although this was based on low-quality evidence (RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.82, 2 studies, 100 participants). Common adverse events included headache and stomach problems (in griseofulvin-treated participants) as well as taste loss and nausea (in terbinafine-treated participants). No studies addressed recurrence rate for this comparison. No study addressed quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

We found high-quality evidence that compared to placebo, terbinafine and azoles are effective treatments for the mycological and clinical cure of onychomycosis, with moderate-quality evidence of excess harm. However, terbinafine probably leads to better cure rates than azoles with the same risk of adverse events (moderate-quality evidence). Azole and griseofulvin were shown to probably have a similar effect on cure, but more adverse events appeared to occur with the latter (moderate-quality evidence). Terbinafine may improve cure and be associated with fewer adverse effects when compared to griseofulvin (low-quality evidence). Only four comparisons assessed recurrence rate: low-quality evidence found that terbinafine or azoles may lower the recurrence rate when compared to placebo, but there may be no difference between them. Only a limited number of studies reported adverse events, and the severity of the events was not taken into account. Overall, the quality of the evidence varied widely from high to very low depending on the outcome and comparison. The main reasons to downgrade evidence were limitations in study design, such as unclear allocation concealment and randomisation as well as lack of blinding.

### Prevention of onychomycosis reinfection for patients with complete cure of all 10 toenails: results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot study of prophylactic miconazole powder 2% [^113Qb8BK]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this 2-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial involving 48 participants was to determine if biweekly miconazole powder prevents onychomycosis recurrence. Intent-to-treat analysis found no significant differences in mycologic, clinical, or complete onychomycosis reinfection rates or time to reinfection. Limitations include small sample size and dosing regimen.

### Interventions for treating fingertip entrapment injuries in children [^117Xhjwt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Fingertip entrapment injuries, which involve lacerations to the pulp and nail and often a fracture of the underlying bone, commonly occur in children, usually as the result of a crushing injury. Treatment is either conservative (wound cleaning and fingertip dressing)or surgical (repair of lacerations, reduction and stabilisation of fractures); however, no consensus currently exists regarding the most appropriate treatment modality.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of surgical and conservative interventions for fingertip entrapment injuries in children. We aimed to compare: different methods of conservative treatment; surgical versus conservative treatment; different methods of surgical treatment; and different methods of management after initial conservative or surgical treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Registry Platform and reference lists of articles up to 30 April 2013. We did not apply any restrictions based on language or publication status.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing interventions for treating fingertip entrapment injuries in children. The primary outcomes were fingertip function, nail growth, nail deformity and adverse events such as infection.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened studies for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias in each included trial and extracted data. We resolved disagreements through discussion.

Main Results

We included two RCTs examining a total of 191 young children, 180 of whom were included in the analyses. The two trials tested different comparisons. Both trials were at high risk of bias, particularly from lack of blinding of participants and personnel, and of outcome assessment. The trials did not record fingertip function, nail growth or nail deformity. The quality of the evidence for the reported outcomes was judged to be 'low' using the GRADE approach (i.e. further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of the effect and is likely to change the estimate). One trial compared a seven-day course of antibiotics with no antibiotics after formal surgical repair of fingertip entrapment injuries. One child in each group had an infection at day seven (1/66 antibiotic group versus 1/69 no antibiotic group; RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.07 to 16.37). Both participants with infections had a more severe injury (partial fingertip amputation). The other trial compared two different dressings (silicone net and paraffin gauze) for use after either surgical or initial conservative management of fingertip entrapment injuries. It reported that two of 20 children in the silicone group versus one of 25 in the paraffin group had complications of wound infection (RR 2.50, 95% CI 0.24 to 25.63) and that one of 20 children in the silicone group versus two of 25 in the paraffin group had skin necrosis (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.06 to 6.41). All complications healed with conservative treatment. The results for mean healing times and mean number of dressing changes were similar between groups but benefits of either silicone or paraffin dressings could not be excluded (silicone mean 4.1 weeks versus paraffin mean 4.0 weeks; MD 0.10 weeks, 95% CI-0.61 to 0.81); (silicone mean 4.3 dressing changes versus paraffin mean 4.2 dressing changes; MD 0.10, 95% CI -0.57 to 0.77). The trial found that a silicone dressing was less likely to adhere to the wound or cause distress for the child at the one-week dressing change.

Authors' Conclusions

There is a lack of evidence from RCTs to inform all key treatment decisions for the management of fingertip entrapment injuries in children. Given that the quality of evidence is low from one trial, we do not have conclusive evidence that prophylactic use of antibiotics after surgical repair fails to reduce risk of infection. The two children who experienced infection had more severe wounds. Similarly, the low quality evidence from one trial has not enabled us to draw firm conclusions regarding the effect on healing time or complications (infection, skin necrosis) at four-week follow-up between a silicone net dressing and a paraffin gauze dressing when applied post-surgery or after simple wound irrigation; however, the silicone net dressing may be easier to remove in the first week. Further RCTs are required in this area, preferably comparing surgical with conservative methods of managing fingertip entrapment injuries. Outcome assessment should include fingertip function, nail growth and nail deformity for a minimum of three months posttreatment.

### Treatment of recurrent ingrown great toenail associated with granulation tissue by partial nail avulsion followed by matricectomy with sharpulse carbon dioxide laser [^114pd6db]. Dermatologic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The effectiveness of partial nail avulsion followed by matricectomy with carbon dioxide (CO2) laser for the treatment of ingrown great toenails remains unclear.

Objective

This study sought to determine the effectiveness of partial nail avulsion followed by matricectomy with sharpulse CO2 laser in the treatment of recurrent ingrown great toenails associated with granulation tissue.

Materials and Methods

Fourteen patients with a total of 18 recurrent ingrown great toenails were randomly selected for participation in this study. Partial nail avulsions followed by matricectomy with sharpulse CO2 laser were performed on the involved nails. After at least 6 months, we evaluated the recurrence of ingrown toenails, regrowth of the nail spike, duration of post-treatment pain and post-treatment infection.

Results

Partial nail avulsion followed by matricectomy with sharpulse CO2 laser in the treatment of ingrown toenails resulted in a high cure rate, short postoperative pain duration and low risk of postoperative infection.

Conclusion

This method we advocate is convenient and effective for the treatment of recurrent ingrown great toenail associated with granulation tissue.

### COVID toes or pernio? [^1119sAFW]. Clinics in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

"COVID toes" are a new phenomenon of pernio-like lesions that has been associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. As dermatology practices reopen and increase patient volumes amid the waning of the coronavirus pandemic, it is important to consider the finding of pernio and pernio-like lesions in the context of both COVID-19 and its other possible etiologies. This contribution will discuss possible causes of pernio and pernio-like lesions and offer suggestions for appropriate diagnostic workup and management when indicated.

### Management of the ingrown toenail… [^116QXJ3m]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

One conservative treatment option is to soak the affected toe and foot for 10 to 20 minutes in warm, soapy water. After each soak, expert recommendation is to apply a topical antibiotic ointment or a mid- to high-potency steroid cream or ointment to the affected area several times daily for a few days until resolution. 12 An uncontrolled case series found a 79 percent rate of symptomatic improvement using cotton wisps over a mean follow-up period of 24 weeks. 13 There is no evidence to suggest that inserting cotton wisps underneath an ingrown nail edge harbors bacteria or potentially increases the risk of infection. Dental floss inserted obliquely under the ingrown nail corner has also been found to be effective in mild to moderate cases, producing minimal, if any, pain and no secondary infection, with almost immediate relief from pain and the ability to resume normal activities.
14.

Staphylococcus aureus and less frequently by Gram-negative species and Streptococcus species. Although the use of oral antibiotics before or after phenolization is widespread, their use is based solely upon historic practice without evidence from clinical trials. Several studies have indicated that once the ingrown portion of the nail is removed and matricectomy is performed, the localized infection will resolve without the need for antibiotic therapy. 18, 19 One randomized controlled trial with 54 patients found no significant difference in healing times between a group that received concomitant antibiotics and phenolization compared with a group that received phenolization alone over two to three weeks. 1 Initial treatment with oral antibiotics before surgical therapy has not been shown to decrease healing times and may delay matricectomy in moderate to severe cases, which can ultimately increase the time until clinical healing.

1 Physicians should strongly consider withholding antibiotic treatment and proceeding to matricectomy if conservative therapy is not an option. 20 The best evidence demonstrates that partial nail avulsion followed by phenolization or direct surgical excision of the nail matrix are equally effective in the treatment of ingrown toenails. 16 Another study found that partial nail avulsion with phenolization yielded better results than partial avulsion with nail matrix excision. 21 In the latter study, local antibiotics did not reduce the risk of infection or recurrence of the ingrown toenail, and phenolization did not increase the risk of infection more than matrix excision.

### Interventions for ingrowing toenails [^112iFpfg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Ingrowing toenails are a common problem in which part of the nail penetrates the skinfold alongside the nail, creating a painful area. Different non-surgical and surgical interventions for ingrowing toenails are available, but there is no consensus about a standard first-choice treatment.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of non-surgical and surgical interventions in a medical setting for ingrowing toenails, with the aim of relieving symptoms and preventing regrowth of the nail edge or recurrence of the ingrowing toenail.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to January 2010: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. We also updated our searches of CINAHL, WEB of SCIENCE, ongoing trials databases, and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of non-surgical and surgical interventions for ingrowing toenails, which are also known by the terms 'unguis incarnatus' and 'onychocryptosis', and those comparing postoperative treatment options. Studies must have had a follow-up period of at least one month.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected studies, assessed methodological quality, and extracted data from selected studies. We analysed outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

This is an update of the Cochrane review 'Surgical treatments for ingrowing toenails'. In this update we included 24 studies, with a total of 2826 participants (of which 7 were also included in the previous review). Five studies were on non-surgical interventions, and 19 were on surgical interventions. The risk of bias of each included study was assessed; this is a measure of the methodological quality of several characteristics in these studies. It was found to be unclear for several items, due to incomplete reporting. Participants were not blinded to the treatment they received because of the nature of the interventions, e.g. surgery or wearing a brace on the toe. Outcome assessors were reported to be blinded in only 9 of the 24 studies. None of the included studies addressed our primary outcomes of 'relief of symptoms' or 'regrowth', but 16 did address 'recurrence'. Not all of the included studies addressed all of our secondary outcomes (healing time, postoperative complications - infection and haemorrhage, pain of operation/postoperative pain, participant satisfaction), and two studies did not address any of the secondary outcomes. Surgical interventions were better at preventing recurrence than non-surgical interventions with gutter treatment (or gutter removal), and they were probably better than non-surgical treatments with orthonyxia (brace treatment). In 4 of the 12 studies in which a surgical intervention with chemical ablation (e.g. phenol) was compared with a surgical intervention without chemical ablation, a significant reduction of recurrence was found. The surgical interventions on both sides in these comparisons were not equal, so it is not clear if the reduction was caused by the addition of the chemical ablation. In only one study, a comparison was made of a surgical intervention known as partial nail avulsion with matrix excision compared to the same surgical intervention with phenol. In this study of 117 participants, the surgical intervention with phenol was significantly more effective in preventing recurrence than the surgical intervention alone (14% compared to 41% respectively, RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.69). None of the postoperative interventions described, such as the use of antibiotics or manuka honey; povidone-iodine with paraffin; hydrogel with paraffin; or paraffin gauze, showed any significant difference when looking at infection rates, pain, or healing time.

Authors' Conclusions

Surgical interventions are more effective than non-surgical interventions in preventing the recurrence of an ingrowing toenail. In the studies comparing a surgical intervention to a surgical intervention with the application of phenol, the addition of phenol is probably more effective in preventing recurrence and regrowth of the ingrowing toenail. Because there is only one study in which the surgical interventions in both study arms were equal, more studies have to be done to confirm these outcomes. Postoperative interventions do not decrease the risk of postoperative infection, postoperative pain, or healing time.

### Systemic antibiotics for treating diabetic foot infections [^112brUtv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Foot infection is the most common cause of non-traumatic amputation in people with diabetes. Most diabetic foot infections (DFIs) require systemic antibiotic therapy and the initial choice is usually empirical. Although there are many antibiotics available, uncertainty exists about which is the best for treating DFIs.

Objectives

To determine the effects and safety of systemic antibiotics in the treatment of DFIs compared with other systemic antibiotics, topical foot care or placebo.

Search Methods

In April 2015 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE, and EBSCO CINAHL. We also searched in the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE; The Cochrane Library), the Health Technology Assessment database (HTA; The Cochrane Library), the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS-EED; The Cochrane Library), unpublished literature in OpenSIGLE and ProQuest Dissertations and on-going trials registers.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of systemic antibiotics (oral or parenteral) in people with a DFI. Primary outcomes were clinical resolution of the infection, time to its resolution, complications and adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted data. Risk ratios (RR) were estimated for dichotomous data and, when sufficient numbers of comparable trials were available, trials were pooled in a meta-analysis.

Main Results

We included 20 trials with 3791 participants. Studies were heterogenous in study design, population, antibiotic regimens, and outcomes. We grouped the sixteen different antibiotic agents studied into six categories: 1) anti-pseudomonal penicillins (three trials); 2) broad-spectrum penicillins (one trial); 3) cephalosporins (two trials); 4) carbapenems (four trials); 5) fluoroquinolones (six trials); 6) other antibiotics (four trials). Only 9 of the 20 trials protected against detection bias with blinded outcome assessment. Only one-third of the trials provided enough information to enable a judgement about whether the randomisation sequence was adequately concealed. Eighteen out of 20 trials received funding from pharmaceutical industry-sponsors. The included studies reported the following findings for clinical resolution of infection: there is evidence from one large trial at low risk of bias that patients receiving ertapenem with or without vancomycin are more likely to have resolution of their foot infection than those receiving tigecycline (RR 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 0.99; 955 participants). It is unclear if there is a difference in rates of clinical resolution of infection between: 1) two alternative anti-pseudomonal penicillins (one trial); 2) an anti-pseudomonal penicillin and a broad-spectrum penicillin (one trial) or a carbapenem (one trial); 3) a broad-spectrum penicillin and a second-generation cephalosporin (one trial); 4) cephalosporins and other beta-lactam antibiotics (two trials); 5) carbapenems and anti-pseudomonal penicillins or broad-spectrum penicillins (four trials); 6) fluoroquinolones and anti-pseudomonal penicillins (four trials) or broad-spectrum penicillins (two trials); 7) daptomycin and vancomycin (one trial); 8) linezolid and a combination of aminopenicillins and beta-lactamase inhibitors (one trial); and 9) clindamycin and cephalexin (one trial). Carbapenems combined with anti-pseudomonal agents produced fewer adverse effects than anti-pseudomonal penicillins (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.84; 1 trial). An additional trial did not find significant differences in the rate of adverse events between a carbapenem alone and an anti-pseudomonal penicillin, but the rate of diarrhoea was lower for participants treated with a carbapenem (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.93; 1 trial). Daptomycin produced fewer adverse effects than vancomycin or other semi-synthetic penicillins (RR 0.61, 95%CI 0.39 to 0.94; 1 trial). Linezolid produced more adverse effects than ampicillin-sulbactam (RR 2.66; 95% CI 1.49 to 4.73; 1 trial), as did tigecycline compared to ertapenem with or without vancomycin (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.34 to 1.60; 1 trial). There was no evidence of a difference in safety for the other comparisons.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence for the relative effects of different systemic antibiotics for the treatment of foot infections in diabetes is very heterogeneous and generally at unclear or high risk of bias. Consequently it is not clear if any one systemic antibiotic treatment is better than others in resolving infection or in terms of safety. One non-inferiority trial suggested that ertapenem with or without vancomycin is more effective in achieving clinical resolution of infection than tigecycline. Otherwise the relative effects of different antibiotics are unclear. The quality of the evidence is low due to limitations in the design of the included trials and important differences between them in terms of the diversity of antibiotics assessed, duration of treatments, and time points at which outcomes were assessed. Any further studies in this area should have a blinded assessment of outcomes, use standardised criteria to classify severity of infection, define clear outcome measures, and establish the duration of treatment.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^117Ntmyk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Recurrent cellulitis — evaluation and prophylaxis: Identify and treat predisposing conditions such as edema, obesity, eczema, venous insufficiency, and toe web abnormalities (strong, moderate), and perform these practices as part of routine patient care and certainly during the acute stage of cellulitis (strong, moderate). Administration of prophylactic antibiotics, such as oral penicillin or erythromycin bid for 4–52 weeks, or intramuscular benzathine penicillin every 2–4 weeks, should be considered in patients who have 3–4 episodes of cellulitis per year despite attempts to treat or control predisposing factors (weak, moderate), and this program should be continued so long as the predisposing factors persist (strong, moderate).

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114pSATx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Erysipelas and cellulitis — evaluation and treatment recommendations are as follows: Cultures of blood or cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs are not routinely recommended (strong, moderate). Cultures of blood are recommended (strong, moderate), and cutaneous and microscopic examination of cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs should be considered in patients with malignancy on chemotherapy, neutropenia, severe cell-mediated immunodeficiency, immersion injuries, and animal bites (weak, moderate). Typical cases of cellulitis without systemic signs of infection should receive an antimicrobial agent that is active against streptococci (mild; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). For cellulitis with systemic signs of infection (moderate nonpurulent SSTI; Figure 1) systemic antibiotics are indicated. Many clinicians could include coverage against MSSA (weak, low). For patients whose cellulitis is associated with penetrating trauma, evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere, nasal colonization with MRSA, injection drug use, or SIRS (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), vancomycin or another antimicrobial effective against both MRSA and streptococci is recommended (strong, moderate). In severely compromised patients (as defined in question 13), broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage may be considered (weak, moderate). Vancomycin plus either piperacillin-tazobactam or imipenem-meropenem is recommended as a reasonable empiric regimen for severe infection (strong, moderate). The recommended duration of antimicrobial therapy is 5 days, but treatment should be extended if the infection has not improved within this time period (strong, high). Elevation of the affected area and treatment of predisposing factors, such as edema or underlying cutaneous disorders, are recommended (strong, moderate). In lower extremity cellulitis, clinicians should carefully examine the interdigital toe spaces because treating fissuring, scaling, or maceration may eradicate colonization with pathogens and reduce the incidence of recurrent infection (strong, moderate). Outpatient therapy is recommended for patients who do not have SIRS, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability (mild nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). Hospitalization is recommended if there is concern for a deeper or necrotizing infection, for patients with poor adherence to therapy, for infection in a severely immunocompromised patient, or if outpatient treatment is failing (moderate or severe nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate).

### Comparison of two surgical methods (winograd and sleeve method) in the treatment of ingrown toenail [^115SRa7T]. Dermatologic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Ingrowing toenail is one of the most common nail complaints. Although many surgical treatments are described for complicated nails, frequent recurrence of pain and postoperative disability necessitate finding an appropriate treatment.

Methods

In a clinical trial, we compared the Winograd and sleeve (gutter) surgical methods to find a simple, painless, and practical alternative.

Results

Of 100 patients (mean 27.8) included in the study, 50 underwent Winograd surgery and the rest the sleeve method. Postoperative infection occurred in four (8%) patients in the sleeve and three (6%) in the Winograd group. The condition reoccurred in five (10%) patients who underwent sleeve surgery and six (12%) who underwent Winograd. Recurrence rate was higher in female patients, although the difference was not statistically significant. Mean surgery duration for Winograd and sleeve methods was 15.7 minutes and 9.4 minutes, respectively, and postoperative work day loss was 2.0 weeks and 1.1 weeks, respectively.

Conclusion

The sleeve method seems to be more practical and appropriate for patients planning to go back to work sooner and better fulfills the main characteristics for the primary treatment of choice. The authors have indicated no significant interest with commercial supporters.

Regarding medical management for onychomycosis, more specifically with respect to systemic antifungals, BAD 2014 guidelines recommend to offer terbinafine (250 mg/day for 6 weeks in fingernail and 12–16 weeks in toenail infection) as first-line therapy in patients with dermatophyte onychomycosis. Obtain baseline LFTs and a CBC in adult patients with a history of hepatotoxicity or hematological abnormalities.

### The British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of foot health in inflammatory arthritis [^116fTQX4]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Toenail pathologies are common in the general population and include onychocryptosis, onychauxis and onychomycosis. These can cause infection and wounds, which have additional implications in people with IA who are immunosuppressed. Consideration should be given to the appropriateness of self-management, and when and how to access a specialist foot services (see recommendation 3).

In PsA, where multiple nails are pathological, systemic rather than local treatment should be considered, and dermatology input should be sought. Systemic drugs for the treatment of nail disease in people with PsA have been shown to be effective; current GRAPPA guidelines strongly recommend biological DMARDs (bDMARDs) for psoriatic nail disease. Topical therapies (e.g. calcipotriol and glucocorticoid preparations, topical tacrolimus, topical ciclosporin, intralesional glucocorticoids and pulsed dye laser) and systemic medications (ciclosporin, methotrexate, acitretin, JAK inhibitors and PDE4 inhibitors) can also be considered. For foot skin disease in PsA, current GRAPPA guidelines strongly recommend topical agents (e.g. emollients, keratolytics, topical corticosteroids) when there is limited body surface area involved. More widespread psoriasis, or foot psoriasis that is unresponsive to topical treatment, should prompt a review of systemic disease management, with methotrexate, ciclosporin, PDE4 inhibitors and JAK inhibitors, and bDMARDs strongly recommended.

Nail surgery should be considered for toenail pathologies that do not or are thought unlikely to resolve with conservative care. When infection is present, antibiotics should be considered and conventional synthetic DMARD (csDMARD) and bDMARD therapy should be suspended, with input from the rheumatology MDT. There is no evidence for one type of nail avulsion surgery procedure over another in IA or generally; matrixectomy should therefore be considered on a case-by-case basis.

### Results of ingrown toenails treated with modified winograd technique using lateral edge inversion modification [^113ukDs5]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Ingrown toenail is a common condition, especially among young individuals, characterized by pain, swelling, redness, and infection. Surgical intervention is often required in stage II and III cases, with the Modified Winograd (MW) technique being the most widely used. Nevertheless, recurrence and infection remain notable concerns.

Purpose

To assess whether lateral edge inversion modification added to the MW technique reduces recurrence rates.

Study Design

Retrospective comparative observational study.

Methods

A total of 341 patients treated between January and November 2023 were analyzed. Group 1 (n = 96) underwent MW with lateral edge inversion, while Group 2 (n = 245) underwent MW alone. Demographics, surgical time, infection rates, recurrence, and recovery were compared.

Results

The mean age was 25.2 years, with 223 males and 118 females. Surgical time was comparable between groups. Early infection occurred in 4.16% of Group 1 and 6.53% of Group 2 (p > 0.05). Recurrence was observed in 10 patients in Group 2 but none in Group 1 (p < 0.05), indicating a significant reduction with lateral edge inversion.

Conclusion

Lateral edge inversion modification is a simple and effective addition to the MW technique, significantly reducing recurrence rates in the treatment of ingrown toenails.

Level Of Evidence

### Surgical management of ingrown toenails-an update overdue [^111vEF85]. Dermatologic Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

For decades, every year sees a wide number of articles about treatment of ingrown toenails. There is still a debate about the cause of this painful condition. Surgical treatments rely on two main approaches: either narrowing the nail plate or debulking the soft tissues. It is up to the surgeon to select the most appropriate approach in each case. All procedures cited in this article have high cure rates as long as they are properly performed. As with all surgical procedures, they are operator dependent. Chemical cautery is the easiest and most versatile technique that may help in almost all instances for lateral ingrowing. For distal embedding and very hypertrophic and exuberant lateral folds, debulking with secondary intention healing is the most effective and easy to perform, with great results.

### Recurrent ingrown toenails secondary to indinavir / ritonavir combination therapy [^116TbWty]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To report five cases of ingrown toenails (IGTN) associated with indinavir/ritonavir (IDV/RTV) combination therapy.

Case Summary

The median onset of IGTN from initiation of IDV/RTV therapy was 18.4 weeks. Four patients previously received IDV, with one of these experiencing prior IGTN. All patients required surgical management of IGTN. All patients received virologic benefit from ongoing antiretroviral therapy, and the majority of patients elected to maintain IDV/RTV combination therapy. Two patients experienced recurrent IGTN while receiving ongoing IDV/RTV combination therapy.

Discussion

IGTN and paronychia have previously been reported with IDV and lamivudine. IGTN in patients with HIV infection is more likely to present acutely, involve more digits, and require surgical management IDV increases retinoic acid signaling and, based on elevated IDV concentrations from concomitant RTV therapy, the risk of IGTN may be increased in patients receiving IDV/RTV combination therapy.

Conclusions

With the increasing popularity of IDV/RTV combination therapy, clinicians should be aware of the potential increase in frequency of dose-related toxicities including IGTN. Evaluation of hands and feet on physical examination should be recommended for all patients being treated with lamivudine and IDV, especially when used in combination with RTV.

### Fungal toenail infections [^116kvvbB]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fungal infections are reported to cause 23% of foot diseases and 50% of nail conditions in people seen by dermatologists, but are less common in the general population, affecting 3% to 5% of people.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of oral treatments for fungal toenail infections? What are the effects of topical treatments for fungal toenail infections? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to March 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 12 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: amorolfine, butenafine, ciclopirox, fluconazole, griseofulvin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, mechanical debridement, terbinafine, and tioconazole.
