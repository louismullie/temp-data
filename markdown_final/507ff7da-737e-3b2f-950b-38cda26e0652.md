## Question

Significance of absolute polymorphic lymphocytosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the significance of absolute polymorphic lymphocytosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and thresholds for lymphocytosis and what "polymorphic" implies morphologically. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis and how morphology guides benign versus malignant processes. Next, I will review the diagnostic workup, including when to order flow cytometry and molecular testing. After that, I need to consider age-specific implications and progression risks, especially MBL and CLL. Finally, I will synthesize practical management and follow-up recommendations, including when observation is appropriate versus when treatment is indicated.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't misinterpret the question. Absolute lymphocytosis is typically defined as an absolute lymphocyte count greater than 4.0–4.5 × 10⁹/L in adults, with higher thresholds in children, and "polymorphic" refers to a morphologically heterogeneous lymphocyte population on peripheral smear, often with variation in size, shape, and cytoplasm, which contrasts with the monomorphic appearance of neoplastic lymphoproliferations.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology just from the count and morphology. I need to check the differential. Polymorphic lymphocytosis is most often reactive to viral infections such as EBV, CMV, or other acute viral illnesses, and can also reflect stress lymphocytosis, immune responses to vaccination, or autoimmune phenomena; in contrast, a monomorphic population raises concern for clonal B- or T-cell disorders, so the polymorphic pattern favors a reactive process rather than a neoplasm [^5b37ffa0] [^5cf4a47f] [^2580cc30].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic implications of morphology. Reactive lymphocytes are typically pleomorphic with activated forms, whereas clonal B-cell disorders like CLL/SLL show uniform small lymphocytes with mature morphology, and T-cell disorders such as T-PLL or LGL leukemia have distinctive phenotypes; thus, polymorphic morphology on smear is a strong negative predictor of malignancy, though it is not absolute and must be integrated with clinical context and ancillary testing [^2580cc30] [^7ea7f896] [^dfa10165].

> I should confirm the initial workup steps. Let me first confirm the CBC with differential and repeat testing if the result is unexpected, then examine a peripheral smear to assess morphology and verify the automated differential; if the smear shows polymorphic lymphocytes and no suspicious monomorphic population, the likelihood of a neoplasm is low, but if there is any doubt or persistent lymphocytosis, flow cytometry immunophenotyping should be performed to exclude a clonal process [^2580cc30] [^8c0cf46c].

> Next, I should review when to escalate to molecular testing. If flow cytometry reveals a clonal T-cell population or the clinical picture suggests a T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, TCR gene rearrangement studies are appropriate; similarly, if a clonal B-cell population is identified, cytogenetics or FISH can refine risk, particularly in high-count MBL where del(13q), trisomy 12, del(11q), or del(17p) carry prognostic implications for progression risk [^b8391037] [^2580cc30].

> Let me consider age-specific significance because this changes pretest probabilities. In adults under about 50 years, polymorphic lymphocytosis is overwhelmingly reactive and rarely reflects clonal disease; in older adults, particularly over 60, the prevalence of monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis rises and even polymorphic-appearing smears may occasionally coexist with low-level clonal B cells, so a lower threshold for flow cytometry is reasonable in this group [^6cdce554] [^64f2a2a6].

> I will now examine the MBL and CLL interface so I don't overcall disease. MBL is defined by a clonal B-cell count less than 5 × 10⁹/L without lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, cytopenias, or symptoms; high-count MBL progresses to CLL requiring therapy at roughly 1–2% per year, whereas low-count MBL rarely progresses but is associated with increased infection risk and reduced overall survival, likely reflecting early immune dysfunction, so I should counsel patients accordingly and monitor periodically [^b8391037] [^54641e4c] [^02ebe473].

> But wait, what if the lymphocytosis is very high or accompanied by cytopenias or organomegaly? I should double-check for transformation to CLL or other lymphomas using Rai/Binet staging principles and guideline-directed evaluation; indications for treatment in CLL include symptomatic disease, progressive lymphocytosis with doubling time less than 6 months, anemia, thrombocytopenia, or bulky lymphadenopathy, and these should trigger hematology referral even if the smear is polymorphic-appearing if clinical features are concerning [^71d82b88] [^cf8869bc].

> Let me synthesize the clinical significance succinctly. Absolute polymorphic lymphocytosis most often signals a reactive immune response, typically viral or stress-related, and the polymorphic morphology argues against a clonal lymphoproliferative disorder; however, in older adults or when lymphocytosis persists, I need to ensure I exclude MBL or early CLL with flow cytometry, recognizing that low-count MBL is common and usually indolent but warrants surveillance for infection risk and rare progression [^2580cc30] [^6cdce554] [^54641e4c].

> Finally, I should confirm practical management. For confirmed reactive polymorphic lymphocytosis, no specific therapy is needed beyond treating the underlying cause and following counts until resolution; for incidental low-count MBL, observation with periodic CBCs and clinical review is appropriate; for high-count MBL or suspected CLL, hematology referral, baseline labs including beta-2-microglobulin, and consideration of prognostic markers are indicated, with treatment reserved for those meeting standard indications rather than treating based on absolute lymphocyte count alone [^b8391037] [^8d5f5fa0] [^cf8869bc].

Absolute polymorphic lymphocytosis is a **reactive lymphocytosis** characterized by a transient increase in lymphocytes with heterogeneous morphology, typically due to viral infections (especially EBV/CMV) [^5b37ffa0], stress, or immune activation [^5cf4a47f]. It is **benign and self-limited**, resolving as the underlying cause abates. Unlike clonal lymphoproliferative disorders, it shows no clonal expansion on flow cytometry or molecular studies [^c777cd98]. Management is supportive, with observation and follow-up CBC; further workup is warranted only if lymphocytosis persists beyond 3–6 months, rises above 5 × 10⁹/L, or is accompanied by cytopenias, organomegaly, or constitutional symptoms [^2580cc30].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

Absolute polymorphic lymphocytosis is defined by an **absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) > 4.0 × 10⁹/L** in adults, with lymphocytes showing polymorphic (heterogeneous) morphology on peripheral smear — varying in size, shape, and cytoplasmic features — and lacking the monomorphic uniformity seen in clonal disorders [^2580cc30]. Diagnosis relies on:

- **CBC with differential**: confirms ALC > 4.0 × 10⁹/L.
- **Peripheral smear**: reveals polymorphic lymphocytes with activated forms (e.g. large, irregular nuclei, basophilic cytoplasm).
- **Flow cytometry**: excludes clonal lymphoproliferative disorders by demonstrating polyclonal lymphocyte populations [^c777cd98].
- **Clinical correlation**: identifies infectious, inflammatory, or stress-related triggers [^8517e656].

---

## Etiology and pathophysiology

Polymorphic lymphocytosis is **typically reactive** to diverse stimuli:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Infectious | - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [^5b37ffa0] <br/> - Cytomegalovirus (CMV) [^51055df2] <br/> - Hepatitis B/C <br/> - HIV <br/> - Pertussis <br/> - Tuberculosis |
| Immune activation | - Autoimmune diseases (e.g. SLE, rheumatoid arthritis) <br/> - Vaccination <br/> - Allergic reactions |
| Stress-related | - Acute stress <br/> - Trauma <br/> - Surgery <br/> - Exercise [^5cf4a47f] |
| Medications | - Allopurinol <br/> - Phenytoin <br/> - Carbamazepine <br/> - Valproic acid |

---

The pathophysiology involves **immune stimulation** leading to proliferation of B and T lymphocytes, with morphologic variation reflecting activation and differentiation [^5cf4a47f].

---

## Clinical significance and prognosis

Polymorphic lymphocytosis is **benign and self-limited**, resolving with treatment or removal of the underlying cause. It carries no inherent risk of progression to malignancy, though persistent lymphocytosis (> 3–6 months) warrants reassessment to exclude evolving clonal disease [^notfound].

---

## Differentiation from clonal lymphoproliferative disorders

Distinguishing polymorphic lymphocytosis from clonal disorders is essential:

| **Feature** | **Polymorphic lymphocytosis** | **Clonal lymphoproliferative disorders** |
|-|-|-|
| Morphology | Heterogeneous, activated lymphocytes | Monomorphic, uniform lymphocytes |
| Flow cytometry | Polyclonal | Monoclonal (light chain restriction) |
| Molecular studies | No clonal rearrangements | Clonal TCR or IGH rearrangements |
| Clinical course | Self-limited, resolves | Persistent, progressive |
| Examples | - Viral infections <br/> - Stress <br/> - Autoimmunity | - CLL <br/> - LGL leukemia <br/> - T-PLL |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A structured approach includes:

- **Confirm ALC**: CBC with differential.
- **Smear review**: assess morphology for polymorphic features [^2580cc30].
- **Flow cytometry**: exclude clonal populations [^c777cd98].
- **Molecular testing**: TCR/IGH rearrangement if clonality is suspected [^f2744820].
- **Clinical assessment**: identify infectious, autoimmune, or stress triggers [^8517e656].

---

## Management and follow-up

Management is **supportive and directed at the underlying cause**:

- **Observation**: for asymptomatic patients with mild lymphocytosis.
- **Treat the cause**: antivirals, antibiotics, or immunomodulatory therapy as indicated.
- **Follow-up**: repeat CBC in 3–6 months; persistent or rising counts, cytopenias, organomegaly, or systemic symptoms require hematology referral and further evaluation [^notfound].

---

## Potential complications

Complications are rare and typically reflect the underlying condition (e.g. autoimmune hemolysis, immune thrombocytopenia) rather than the lymphocytosis itself. Persistent lymphocytosis may signal an **undiagnosed clonal process** and should prompt reassessment [^notfound].

---

Absolute polymorphic lymphocytosis is a **reactive, benign process** with heterogeneous lymphocyte morphology, most often due to infection, stress, or immune activation. It resolves with treatment of the cause and does not progress to malignancy; persistent or atypical cases require exclusion of clonal disease via flow cytometry and molecular studies [^2580cc30].

### Predictive significance of absolute lymphocyte count and morphology in adults with a new onset peripheral blood lymphocytosis [^fe19822e]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Aims

Lymphocytosis is commonly encountered in the haematology laboratory. Evaluation of blood films is an important screening tool for differentiating between reactive and malignant processes. The optimal lymphocyte number to trigger morphological evaluation of the smear has not been well defined in the literature. Likewise, the significance of lymphocyte morphology has not been well studied and there are no consensus guidelines or follow-up recommendations available. We attempt to evaluate the significance of lymphocyte morphology and to define the best possible cut-off value of absolute lymphocyte count for morphology review.

Methods

71 adult patients with newly detected lymphocytosis of 5.0 × 10⁹/L or more were categorised to either a reactive process or a lymphoproliferative disorder. We performed statistical analysis and morphology review to compare the difference in age, gender, lymphocyte count and morphological features between the two groups. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to determine an optimal lymphocyte number to trigger morphology review.

Results

Lymphoproliferative disorders are associated with advanced age and higher lymphocyte count. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of lymphocyte morphology as a screening test were 0.9, 0.59, 0.60, 0.58 and 0.71, respectively. The optimal cut-off of lymphocyte number for morphology review was found to be close to 7 × 10⁹/L.

Conclusions

We found a moderate interobserver agreement for the morphological assessment. 'Reactive' morphology was very predictive of a reactive process, but 'malignant' morphology was a poor predictor of a lymphoproliferative disorder.

### Using peripheral smear review, age and absolute lymphocyte count as predictors of abnormal peripheral blood lymphocytoses diagnosed by flow cytometry [^69340bb9]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2008). Low credibility.

Absolute lymphocytosis in the elderly raises the possibility of malignancy and generally warrants further investigation. To better correlate clinical variables with the frequency of neoplastic lymphoid processes in this population, we retrospectively reviewed archived flow cytometric analyses from peripheral blood specimens on patients of 50 years of age and older that had been deemed suspicious for a lymphoproliferative process after peripheral smear review. Age, absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), white blood cell count and relative lymphocyte count were correlated with the results of flow cytometry. Of 71 total cases, 42 (59%) had an abnormal immunophenotype. Independent variables that showed significant differences between normal and abnormal immunophenotype were mean age (p = 0.001) and ALC (p = 0.0032). We combined age and absolute lymphocyte count variables to look for the best possible cutoff values to predict the likelihood of an abnormal immunophenotype. ALC cutoff values of ≥ 4 × 10⁹ cells/L for patients over 67 years of age, and > 6.7 × 10⁹ cells/L for patients between 50 and 67 years of age, had a high sensitivity for detecting an abnormal immunophenotype.

### Establishing absolute lymphocyte count thresholds for further review of peripheral blood lymphocytosis to judiciously screen for monoclonal B-cell populations in older adults [^64f2a2a6]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Lymphocytosis may represent either a lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD) or a reactive process. The absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) threshold for further evaluation of lymphocytosis is not well established.

Methods

We prospectively performed flow cytometry on blood samples from patients 50 years or older with ALCs of 4.0 × 10⁹ cells/L or greater without a history of an LPD.

Results

Monoclonal B-cell populations were found in 34 (19.1%) of 178 cases, with incidence increasing with age. In patients younger than 75 years, no monoclonal B-cell population was identified in patients with ALCs less than 4.4 × 10⁹ cells/L, while such clones were found below and above this threshold in patients 75 years and older.

Conclusions

These findings support a threshold for smear review and flow cytometry no lower than 4.4 × 10⁹ cells/L in patients younger than 75 years and a threshold as low as 4.0 × 10⁹ cells/L in patients 75 years and older.

### Low-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis persists after seven years of follow up and is associated with a poorer outcome [^222a669b]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Low-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis is defined by the presence of very low numbers of circulating clonal B cells, usually phenotypically similar to chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, whose biological and clinical significance remains elusive. Herein, we re-evaluated 65/91 low-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis cases (54 chronic lymphocytic leukemia-like and 11 non-chronic lymphocytic leukemia-like) followed-up for a median of seven years, using high-sensitivity flow cytometry and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization. Overall, the clone size significantly increased in 69% of low-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis cases, but only one subject progressed to high-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis. In parallel, the frequency of cytogenetic alterations increased over time (32% vs. 61% of cases, respectively). The absolute number of the major T-cell and natural killer cell populations also increased, but only among chronic lymphocytic leukemia-like cases with increased clone size vs. age- and sex-matched controls. Although progression to chronic lymphocytic leukemia was not observed, the overall survival of low-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis individuals was significantly reduced vs. non-monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis controls (P = 0.03) plus the general population from the same region (P ≤ 0.001), particularly among females (P = 0.01); infection and cancer were the main causes of death in low-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis. In summary, despite the fact that mid-term progression from low-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis to high-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis and chronic lymphocytic leukemia appears to be unlikely, these clones persist at increased numbers, usually carrying more genetic alterations, and might thus be a marker of an impaired immune system indirectly associated with a poorer outcome, particularly among females.

### Common occurrence of monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis among members of high-risk CLL families [^8fed76f5]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) is an asymptomatic haematological condition characterized by low absolute levels of B-cell clones with a surface immunophenotype similar to that of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). In the general population, MBL increases with age with a prevalence of 5–9% in individuals over age 60 years. It has been reported to be higher among first-degree relatives from CLL families. We report results of multi-parameter flow cytometry among 505 first-degree relatives with no personal history of lymphoproliferative disease from 140 families having at least two cases of CLL. Seventeen percent of relatives had MBL. Age was the most important determinant where the probability for developing MBL by age 90 years was 61%. MBL clustered in certain families but clustering was independent of the number of known CLL cases in a family. As is the case with CLL, males had a significantly higher risk for MBL than did females (P = 0.04). MBL patients had significantly higher mean absolute lymphocyte counts (2.4 × 10⁹/l) and B-cell counts (0.53 × 10⁹/l) than those with a normal B-cell immuno-phenotype. Our findings show that MBL occurs at a very high rate in high risk CLL families. Both the age and gender distribution of MBL are parallel to CLL, implying a shared inherited risk.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma — monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis criteria and SLL diagnostic caveat: An absolute monoclonal B lymphocyte count < 5000/mm³ that persists more than 3 months without palpable adenopathy or other clinical features of lymphoproliferative disorder is MBL; cells of the same phenotype may be seen in reactive lymph nodes, so diagnosis of SLL should only be made when effacement of lymph node architecture is seen, and bone marrow examination is not helpful for the diagnosis of MBL.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia / small lymphocytic lymphoma, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^b8391037]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Monoclonal B‑cell lymphocytosis (MBL) — definition, categories, and management — uses absolute B‑cell count criteria and progression risk. An absolute monoclonal B‑lymphocyte count of < 5 × 10⁹/L that is stable over a 3‑month period in the absence of palpable lymphadenopathy or other clinical features… is defined as MBL; MBL is further categorized into low‑count MBL (< 0.5 × 10⁹/L) and high‑count MBL (0.5–4.9 × 10⁹/L) with therapy‑requiring progression at a rate of 1% to 2% per year, high‑count MBL is distinguished from Rai 0 CLL based on whether the monoclonal B‑cell count is above or below 5 × 10⁹/L, and observation is recommended for all individuals with MBL.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma — monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) criteria and management: An absolute monoclonal B-lymphocyte count of < 5 × 10⁹/L that is stable over a 3-month period in the absence of palpable lymphadenopathy or other clinical features characteristic of a lymphoproliferative disorder is defined as MBL; MBL is further categorized into low-count MBL (< 0.5 × 10⁹/L) that rarely progresses to CLL and high-count MBL (0.5–4.9 × 10⁹/L) that can progress to CLL requiring therapy at a rate of 1% to 2% per year; high-count MBL is distinguished from Rai 0 CLL based on whether the monoclonal B-cell count is above or below 5 × 10⁹/L; observation is recommended for all individuals with MBL.

### Clonal evolution is a prognostic factor for the clinical progression of monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis [^d0ce511c]. Blood Cancer Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) has attracted intensive research as the prelude of chronic lymphoproliferative disorders, mainly chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). According to current criteria, MBL is a preclinical condition characterized by monoclonal B-cell expansions at small concentrations (< 5 × 10⁹ cells/l) in the peripheral blood of otherwise healthy individuals. It is now obvious that MBL is a highly heterogeneous entity regarding the immunophenotypic characteristics and the B-cell clone burden. In immunophenotypic terms, MBL is distinguished into three main categories: (i) CLL-like (CD5 + CD20 dim CD23 + sIg low) accounting for 70–75% of all cases; (ii) atypical (CD5 + CD20 bright/+), mainly CD23 dim/ −; and (iii) CD5 neg MBL. Based on the number of monoclonal B-cells, MBL is divided into low and high-count, each with a clearly different clinical course. Low-count MBL is a non-progressive entity with a normal absolute B-cell count, whereas high-count or 'clinical' MBL (cMBL) is characterized by absolute lymphocytosis and progresses to CLL at a rate of ~1–2% per year.

The prevalence of CLL-like MBL is 10–100-fold higher than that of CLL, indicating that most cases — even within the high-count category — do not evolve to overt disease. However, the biological features and molecular events which may contribute to the transition into the clinical state are far from being completely elucidated. Particularly, the available information on the clinical progression of non CLL-like MBL is scanty. To improve our understanding of these processes we performed a prospective study on a large series of 227 cMBL cases of all three phenotypic categories testing for possible changes occurring during the natural course of MBL. These changes together with all available clinical parameters were further evaluated for their potential role in lymphomagenesis during a long-term follow-up (median 76 months).

All individuals included, attended the outpatient clinics of our hospital between January 2001 and January 2015 and characterized as MBL of any type according to current diagnostic criteria. They had no history or evidence of a hematological/solid neoplasia or autoimmunity and provided written informed consent to use laboratory data for research studies. The study followed the rules of the Interval Review Board and adhered to the declaration of Helsinki.

### Transient stress lymphocytosis: an immunophenotypic characterization of the most common cause of newly identified adult lymphocytosis in a tertiary hospital [^5cf4a47f]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

We prospectively evaluated 52 consecutive cases of newly identified absolute lymphocytosis to determine the hematologic and immunophenotypic features of transient stress lymphocytosis (TSL). The lymphocytosis in all cases was associated with an acute stressful event and ranged from 4,000 to 10,400/microL (4.0–10.4 × 10⁹/L). Compared with healthy individuals, patients with TSL showed an increase in the total WBC, absolute lymphocyte (ALC), absolute neutrophil (ANC), and platelet counts with no difference in hemoglobin levels. Immunophenotypic analyses of 38 cases revealed increases in absolute numbers of T B, and natural killer cells. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were increased, predominantly accountedfor by an increase in memory cell subsets, with no change in gamma/delta T cells. Follow-up studies showed a significant reduction in the ALC with a concurrent increase in the ANC and reduction in hemoglobin values. The reduction in lymphocytes at resolution was accompanied by reduction in all broad Iymphocyte subsets. However, naive and memory subsets showed different patterns of alteration within the CD4+ and CD8+ populations, suggesting that acute stress differentially affects the in vivo distribution of these subsets.

### Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) with normal lymphocyte counts is associated with decreased numbers of normal circulating B-cell subsets [^967b0285]. American Journal of Hematology (2012). Low credibility.

Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) with normal lymphocyte counts is associated with decreased numbers of normal circulating B-cell subsets. Little is known about the distribution of normal lymphoid cells and their subsets in the peripheral blood (PB) of subjects with monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL). In our study, we compared the absolute number of PB lymphoid cells and their subpopulations in 95 MBL cases with normal lymphocyte counts vs. 617 age-/sex-matched non-MBL healthy subjects (controls), using highly sensitive flow cytometry. MBL cases showed significantly reduced numbers of normal circulating B-cells, at the expense of immature and naive B-cells; in addition, CD4+CD8+ double-positive T-cells and CD8+ T-cells were significantly lower and higher vs. controls, respectively. Moreover, most normal B-cell subsets were significantly decreased in PB at > 1% MBL-counts, vs. "low-count" MBL cases, and lower amounts of immature/naive B-cells were detected in biclonal (particularly in cases with coexisting CLL-like- and non-CLL-like B-cell clones) vs. monoclonal MBL subjects. In summary, our results show imbalanced (reduced) absolute numbers of recently produced normal circulating B-cells (e.g., immature and naıve B-cells) in MBL, which becomes more pronounced as the MBL cell count increases.

Monoclonal B‑cell lymphocytosis (MBL) — diagnostic features include an absolute monoclonal B‑lymphocyte count < 5 × 10⁹/L, all palpable lymph nodes < 1.5 cm, no anemia, no thrombocytopenia, no palpable organomegaly, and no constitutional symptoms.

### Low-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis persists after seven years of follow up and is associated with a poorer outcome [^b0680762]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical outcome of MBL lo cases

Three subjects developed absolute lymphocytosis after seven years of follow-up (median: 5.3 × 10⁹ lymphocytes/L; range: 4.1 × 10⁹–5.9 × 10⁹/L) in the absence of signs of disease. Two had CLL-like B-cell clones carrying del(13q14), while the remaining case had a non CLL-like clone. In one of the two CLL-like MBL lo cases, the size of the B-cell clone increased over the threshold for MBL hi (> 500 clonal B cells/μL), while the other two cases remained as MBL lo. Remarkably, these three subjects displayed the highest increase in clone size at re-evaluation: this translated into a significantly lower (estimated) time to progression into CLL (median: 95y; range: 54–128y) according to the predictive mathematical model used. In turn, the estimated time to progression to CLL for the other MBL lo individuals was far beyond a normal life expectancy (median: 54,767y; range: 54– > 63 million years).

### Cytogenetic aberrations and immunoglobulin VH gene mutations in clinically benign CD5-monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis [^543313af]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

The finding of monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) raises questions on the nature of clonal cell expansion and its risk of progression. We identified and characterized 7 cases of clinically benign clonal B-cell lymphocytosis. The clonal lymphocytes were clearly of CD5- and non-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) phenotype. All cases had mild to moderate absolute lymphocytosis. The clonal population accounted for 95% to 99% of B cells. For a follow-up period of 4 to 16 years, clonal lymphocytosis was persistent but virtually not progressing. Patients' conditions remained clinically stable and asymptomatic. The clonal populations had somatic hypermutations of the VH gene in 6 cases, indicating a germinal center or post-germinal center B-lymphocyte origin. Clonal cytogenetic aberrations were found in 5 of 6 cases, with 2 clones bearing isochromosome 17q that resulted in loss of p53 and 2 other clones with 7q abnormalities. By the presence of absolute lymphocytosis, this series differs from MBL cases identified by sensitive flow cytometry in normal populations. The phenotypic profiles are distinct from that of benign CLL. We suggest these CD5-B-cell lymphocytosis cases may represent an intermediate condition between covert clonal expansions and overt malignancy.

### A new automated flow cytometry data analysis approach for the diagnostic screening of neoplastic B-cell disorders in peripheral blood samples with absolute lymphocytosis [^c777cd98]. Leukemia (2006). Low credibility.

Currently, multiparameter flow cytometry immunophenotyping is the selected method for the differential diagnostic screening between reactive lymphocytosis and neoplastic B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (B-CLPD). Despite this, current multiparameter flow cytometry data analysis approaches still remain subjective due to the need of experienced personnel for both data analysis and interpretation of the results. In this study, we describe and validate a new automated method based on vector quantization algorithms to analyze multiparameter flow cytometry immunophenotyping data in a series of 307 peripheral blood (PB) samples. Our results show that the automated method of analysis proposed compares well with currently used manual approach and significantly improves semiautomated approaches and, that by using it, a highly efficient discrimination with 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity can be made between normal/reactive PB samples and cases with B-CLPD based on the total B-cell number and/or the sIgkappa+/sIglambda+ B-cell ratio. In addition, the method proved to be able to detect the presence of pathologic neoplastic B-cells even when these are present at low frequencies (< 5% of all lymphocytes in the sample) and in poor-quality samples enriched in 'noise' events.

### Acquired pure red cell aplasia: updated review of treatment [^dfa10165]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

The evidence of a granular lymphocytosis greater than 2 × 10⁹/l lasting for more than 6 months has been regarded as the criteria for defining the disease. However, the normal range for peripheral blood LGL counts is 0.223 ± 0.099 × 10⁹/l and clonal disease has been documented in 8% of patients when absolute LGL counts are between 0.6 to 1.0 × 10⁹/l. Thus, an expansion of a restricted LGL subset demonstrates the diagnosis of LGL-leukaemia and a 6-month follow-up criterion is not necessary when clonality is established. The characteristic finding is the presence of increased numbers of LGL, usually identified by a greater size than normal lymphocytes, abundant pale cytoplasm, and prominent azurophilic granules. However, these features may vary, even among cells from the same patient. The granulation can range from fine to coarse, and some cells may have otherwise characteristic features but lack granules (sometimes called large agranular lymphocytes). Occasionally, clonally expanded lymphocytes with a characteristic CD3 +, CD57 + phenotype may not have LGL morphology on a peripheral smear but may represent in vivo antigen-activated cytotoxic effector T cells. An increase of CD3 + /CD56 − or CD3 − /CD56 + cells by peripheral-blood flow cytometry and/or an inverted CD4 + /CD8 + cell ratio (< 1.0) suggests the existence of LGL leukaemia.

### Causes of double-negative T-cell lymphocytosis in children and adults [^9ba7235c]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

The causes and diagnosis of 'double-negative' (CD3+CD4-CD8-) T-cell lymphocytosis are not well studied. We aimed to define the causes of double-negative T-cell lymphocytosis in children and adults, and to identify simple clinical and laboratory features that would help to differentiate between the underlying conditions.

Methods

We collected clinical and laboratory data on 10 children and 30 adults with significantly increased peripheral-blood double-negative T-cells (> 10% of total lymphocytes). We identified conditions associated with double-negative T-lymphocytosis with flow cytometry, peripheral-blood morphology and T-cell receptor-gene rearrangement studies. Patients were assigned to diagnostic categories on the basis of these test results.

Results and Conclusions

The causes of double-negative T-cell lymphocytosis in children were autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) and reactive γ/δ Τ-lymphocytosis. T-cell large granular lymphocyte (T-LGL) leukaemia, reactive γ/δ T-lymphocytosis and hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTL) were the the most common disorders underlying double-negative T-cell lymphocytosis in adults. Less common causes included hypereosinophilic syndrome, peripheral T-cell lymphoma, ALPS and monoclonal, double-negative T-lymphocytosis of uncertain significance. CD5/CD7/Vδ2 expression and absolute double-negative lymphocyte count (< 1.8 × 10⁹/L) were useful discriminators for distinguishing patients with reactive γ/δ T-lymphocytosis from those with γ/δ lymphoproliferative disorders. Differentiating between γ/δ T-LGL and HSTL can be difficult. Expression of CD57 and cellular morphology (pale cytoplasm with distinct granules) would support a diagnosis of γ/δ T-LGL.

### The risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among individuals with monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis [^078e7dec]. Blood Cancer Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the underlying cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a novel coronavirus that has caused a global pandemic, with more than 84 million cases and over 1 million deaths reported in the United States (US). Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are at particularly high risk for developing the severe disease when infected by SARS-CoV-2. This increased risk is thought to be secondary to a dysregulated immune system inherently associated with CLL, in addition to CLL treatments that can further exacerbate immunosuppression and blunt response to vaccination. In two large retrospective series of CLL patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, the case fatality rate was 35%; patients with previously untreated CLL and those on active treatment had similar outcomes. Monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL), a precursor condition to CLL, is defined as an absolute clonal B cell count of < 5 × 10⁹/L, in the absence of lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and cytopenias. MBL is one of the most common pre-malignant conditions in humans, affecting approximately 5–10% of adults over the age of 40 years. MBL can be further subdivided into low-count MBL (typically identified through screening and defined by an absolute B-cell count < 0.5 × 10⁹/L) and high-count MBL with absolute B cell count 0.5–4.9 × 10⁹/L (typically identified in the clinic). Recent data indicate that both low- and high-count MBL are at high risk of developing serious infections requiring hospitalization relative to healthy individuals without MBL, suggesting that immune dysfunction in CLL develops early during B cell leukemogenesis. To our knowledge, there are no studies examining the risk of COVID-19 infection in MBL.

### Lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy: benign or malignant? [^816e2466]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

The increasing use of immunophenotypic and molecular analysis in the routine evaluation of patients with lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, or other hematologic disorders has led to the identification of unexpected small clonal lymphoid populations. These clones, sometimes with disease-specific markers, such as the t(14;18), are especially challenging for the clinician because of their unknown biologic potential and uncertain clinical behavior. Study of these early lymphoid lesions is providing important clues to the process of lymphomagenesis, and may provide the rationale for preemptive therapy in the future. More and more, the hematologist/oncologist is consulted regarding otherwise healthy individuals with lymphadenopathy and/or lymphocytosis, and pathology reports that confound the referring internist or surgeon. The report does not name a malignant lymphoproliferative disorder, but is not completely "normal". Does the patient have a benign or malignant condition? How should they be evaluated? Is treatment indicated? These patients prove challenging for the consulting hematologist as well as the referring physician. In this review, we will focus on some of these scenarios and attempt to provide guidance for their management.

### Large granular lymphocytosis with cytopenias after allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation: clinical characteristics and response to immunosuppressive therapy [^a10ec2dd]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Large granular lymphocytosis (LGL)-or LGL leukemia-is a T- or NK-cell lymphoproliferative disorder that often results in cytopenias and autoimmune phenomena. Several studies have described LGL in a subset of patients after allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation (alloBMT), almost exclusively in the setting of asymptomatic lymphocytosis. Some have suggested an association with improved transplant-related outcomes. In contrast, clinically significant LGL after alloBMT is only described in small case reports. This study sought to assess the characteristics, significance, and response to treatment of LGL associated with unexplained anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia after alloBMT. We performed a retrospective analysis of 150 patients who were evaluated for LGL by peripheral blood flow cytometry (LGL flow) for unexplained cytopenias following initial engraftment after alloBMT from January 1 2012 to July 1, 2019. We identified patients with abnormally increased populations of LGL cells (LGL+) as assessed by Johns Hopkins Hematopathology. We collected demographic, transplantation, and LGL treatment information from electronic medical records. We compared LGL+ patients to patients with unexplained cytopenias with negative flow cytometry for LGL (LGL-) in this cohort. We also assessed change in blood counts after 4 weeks of immunosuppressive therapy in LGL+ patients. Cytopenias occurred at a median of 5.7 months (range 1–81) after alloBMT. The majority of the transplants were nonmyeloablative from haploidentical donors, and all patients received post-transplantation cyclophosphamide for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, consistent with the overall alloBMT characteristics at our center. We identified 70 patients with LGL and cytopenias, representing 47% of those evaluated by flow cytometry. There were no significant demographic or transplant-related differences between LGL+ patients and LGL- patients. The median age was 59, and 63% were male. LGL+ patients were more likely to have had cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia (73% versus 28%, P < .0001), but not acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease. LGL+ patients had higher absolute lymphocyte counts (1500 versus 485/mm³, P < .0001), a trend toward lower absolute neutrophil count (660 versus 965/mm 3, P = 0.17), and lower neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (0.39 versus 1.71, P < .001). There were no differences in overall survival or relapse-free survival. Of those with T-cell LGL, 45 were assessed for T-cell receptor clonality. In all, 22% were clonal, 53% oligoclonal, 4% polyclonal, and 20% indeterminate. Thirty (43%) LGL+ patients received immunosuppressive therapy (IST) for cytopenias. First-line treatment was corticosteroids for 25 (83%). Among those treated, there was an increase in median absolute neutrophil count from 720 before treatment to 1990/mm³ after 4 weeks (P = 0.0017). Thrombocytopenia and anemia showed at most a mild improvement with IST. LGL was a common association with otherwise unexplained cytopenias after alloBMT, almost always after prior CMV infection. LGL in the setting of cytopenias did not predict improved transplantation outcomes compared to those with cytopenias without presence of LGL. IST was effective at improving neutropenia associated with LGL after alloBMT.

### RAI stage… [^9f2a3bad]. seer.cancer.gov (2018). Low credibility.

Name RAI stage This definition applies to All SEER websites where this term appears. Definition Chronic lymphocytic leukemia has no standard staging system; however, a National Cancer Institute -sponsored work group formulated standardized guidelines for criteria eligibility, response, and toxic effects to be used in future clinical trials in CLL. The RAI staging system has 5 stage groups. Stage 0 Stage 0 CLL is characterized by absolute lymphocytosis without adenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, or thrombocytopenia. Stage I Stage I CLL is characterized by absolute lymphocytosis with lymphadenopathy without hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, or thrombocytopenia. Stage II Stage II CLL is characterized by absolute lymphocytosis with either hepatomegaly or splenomegaly with or without lymphadenopathy.

Stage III Stage III CLL is characterized by absolute lymphocytosis and anemia with or without lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, or splenomegaly. Stage IV Stage IV CLL is characterized by absolute lymphocytosis and thrombocytopenia with or without lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or anemia. The RAI staging system has 5 stage groups. Stage 0 Stage 0 CLL is characterized by absolute lymphocytosis without adenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, or thrombocytopenia. Stage I Stage I CLL is characterized by absolute lymphocytosis with lymphadenopathy without hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, or thrombocytopenia. Stage II Stage II CLL is characterized by absolute lymphocytosis with either hepatomegaly or splenomegaly with or without lymphadenopathy. Stage III Stage III CLL is characterized by absolute lymphocytosis and anemia with or without lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, or splenomegaly.

Stage IV Stage IV CLL is characterized by absolute lymphocytosis and thrombocytopenia with or without lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or anemia.

### Malignant or benign leukocytosis [^2580cc30]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis, or elevated WBC count, is a commonly encountered laboratory finding. Distinguishing malignant from benign leukocytosis is a critical step in the care of a patient, which initiates a vastly different decision tree. Confirmation of the complete blood cell count and the WBC differential is the first step. Examination of the PB smear is essential to confirming the automated blood cell differential or affirming the manual differential performed on the PB smear. Next is separation of the leukocytosis into a myeloid versus a lymphoid process. Distinguishing a reactive lymphoid proliferation from a lymphoproliferative disorder requires examination of lymphocyte morphology for pleomorphic lymphocytes versus a monomorphic population, with the latter favoring a lymphoproliferative neoplasm. Samples suspicious for lymphoproliferative disorders can be confirmed and characterized by flow cytometry, with molecular studies initiated in select cases; precursor lymphoid neoplasms (lymphoblasts) should trigger a BM examination. Myeloid leukocytosis triggers a differential diagnosis of myeloid leukemoid reactions versus myeloid malignancies. The manual differential is key, along with correct enumeration of blasts and blast equivalents, immature granulocytes, basophils, and eosinophils and identifying dysplasia to identify myeloid malignancies. Confirmation and characterization of myeloid malignancies should be performed with a BM examination and the appropriate ancillary studies. Myeloid leukemoid reactions commonly result from infections and show activated neutrophil changes on morphology; these should prompt evaluation for infection. Other causes of reactive myeloid leukocytoses are also discussed herein.

### Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis: definitions and natural history [^19b342cc]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2009). Low credibility.

The diagnostic term monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) is used to characterise individuals with a circulating population of clonal B-cells, a total B-cell count of < 5 × 10⁹/L, and no other features of a B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. The clinical implications of MBL may differ depending on whether an individual with a normal lymphocyte count is identified via a screening assay (screening MBL) or identified through clinical evaluation of lymphocytosis (clinical MBL). The B-cell count used to distinguish between clinical MBL (< 5 × 10⁹/L) and CLL (≥ 5 × 10⁹/L) was selected largely based on tradition and technological advances and it is unknown whether the natural history of 'clinical MBL' differs from that of patients with Rai stage 0 CLL. Since, a diagnosis of 'leukemia' may lead to profound psychologic distress for patients, we believe the diagnosis of CLL should be based on an individual's risk of developing symptoms, requiring chemotherapeutic treatment and/or dying of disease. Additional studies are needed to determine whether the clinical outcome of patients with MBL differs from that of patients with Rai stage 0 CLL and to identify what B-cell threshold optimally distinguishes between these conditions.

### Expert-independent classification of mature B-cell neoplasms using standardized flow cytometry: a multicentric study [^3a080ada]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

As expected, high-count monoclonal B lymphocytosis cases were diagnosed as CLL by our approach (data not shown). We recommend determining this differential diagnosis using the absolute counts of malignant B cells in blood for every case automatically assigned to the CLL category. A particular challenge for the model is the inclusion of DLBCL cases that were missing in a previous publication.CD10 + DLBCL interfered with the correct classification of a fraction of FL and BL cases, whereas a subgroup of CD10 − DLBCL cases were difficult to distinguish from LPL and MZL exclusively using phenotypic data (Table 4). Not surprisingly, DLBCL therefore belonged to the disease categories with the lowest PPV and NPV. Nevertheless, we feel that classification models that do not consider this frequent lymphoma that requires distinct treatment would limit the clinical utility of any diagnostic algorithm. A major advantage of this method when compared with previous studies is that, for the first time, diagnostic accuracy of an automated algorithm was based on quantitative flow cytometry data from multiple centers, whereas recently published manuscriptsdescribed single-center investigations.

### Prognostic value of leukocytosis and lymphopenia for coronavirus disease severity [^0a8c9842]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Pooled data across early studies validate a significant correlation between elevated leukocyte count and decreased lymphocyte count among patients with severe cases of COVID-19 compared with those with mild cases. Why lymphopenia is associated with severe illness remains unclear. It has been hypothesized that this association could result from direct lymphocyte infection, destruction of lymphatic tissue, inflammation leading to lymphocyte apoptosis, or inhibition of lymphocytes by metabolic disorders such as lactic acidosis. Lymphopenia as a marker of severity does not seem to be specific to COVID-19; it has been used to prognosticate other viral pneumonias such as influenza. Neutrophilia may be more specific to severe disease than leukocytosis, but neutrophil count was not uniformly reported across the studies included in our analysis.

Despite our findings regarding clinical characteristics of severe COVID-19, our study had several limitations. First, our literature search found an expected paucity of data surrounding this topic because published characterizations of patients with COVID-19 remain minimal. More COVID-19 data from other nations and patient populations will aid in the comparison and validation of our clinical findings. Second, we noted significant heterogeneity in both the leukocyte and lymphocyte analyses. This phenomenon probably resulted from the small sample size, limited and early data, and skewed representation of the patient population. Third, the definitions of severe cases were somewhat inconsistent across these studies, varying from acute hypoxic respiratory failure to requiring mechanical ventilation. This variability could further compound the heterogeneity found across these studies. Last, only a minority of the manuscripts reported the proportion of patients with lymphopenia, and variable cutoffs based on the articles' reference ranges made it difficult to ascertain a cutoff for severe disease.

With the rising cases of COVID-19 and limited resources, being able to prioritize patients with severe disease is crucial. Some therapeutic agents are being investigated; however, supplies are often low and procurement may be delayed. The sooner patients with severe disease can be identified, the sooner the process of obtaining therapy can be initiated.

### Association of elevated serumfree light chains with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis [^e7f98d9e]. Blood Cancer Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has an underlying heritable predisposition, with ~10% of individuals affected with CLL reporting a first-degree relative with CLL or a related lymphoproliferative disorder –. Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL), precursor disease to CLL, is an asymptomatic hematologic condition characterized by small absolute levels of blood B-cell clone and no other signs of a lymphoproliferative disorder –. In the general population, MBL increases with age with a prevalence of 5–9% in individuals over age 60 years. We have reported MBL to be higher among first-degree relatives from CLL families, occurring at a higher rate in high-risk CLL families, implying a shared inherited risk.

Paraproteins, usually aligned with plasma cell disorders, have also been found to be prevalent in other B-cell malignancies, such as CLL. In 2007, Martin et al.evaluated the frequency of monoclonal serum-free light-chain (sFLC) measurements in patients with other B-cell malignancies and established abnormal sFLCs can be detected in a substantial proportion of patients with Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and CLL, and may be a useful clinical tool in the early diagnosis of a B-cell malignancy. Since then other studies have shown that sFLCs and the associated κ / λ ratio (rFLC) can also be used to inform prognosis, survival, and clinical outcomes in patients with CLL –. Maurer et al.found that both monoclonal and polyclonal sFLC elevations were associated with poor overall survival in CLL compared to patients with normal sFLCs, even after adjusting for Rai stage. A prospective study showed an abnormal rFLC can be detected several years before the actual diagnosis of CLL in a significant percentage of patients. Thus, sFLC measurements have been implicated in detection and prognosis of CLL, however, few studies evaluating sFLCs and risk of CLL (or MBL) have been performed.

### Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis and chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^6cdce554]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2008). Excellent credibility.

Background

A diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) requires a count of over 5000 circulating CLL-phenotype cells per cubic millimeter. Asymptomatic persons with fewer CLL-phenotype cells have monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL). The goal of this study was to investigate the relation between MBL and CLL.

Methods

We investigated 1520 subjects who were 62 to 80 years of age with a normal blood count and 2228 subjects with lymphocytosis (> 4000 lymphocytes per cubic millimeter) for the presence of MBL, using flow cytometry. Monoclonal B cells were further characterized by means of cytogenetic and molecular analyses. A representative cohort of 185 subjects with CLL-phenotype MBL and lymphocytosis were monitored for a median of 6.7 years (range, 0.2 to 11.8).

Results

Monoclonal CLL-phenotype B cells were detected in 5.1% of subjects (78 of 1520) with a normal blood count and 13.9% (309 of 2228) with lymphocytosis. CLL-phenotype MBL had a frequency of 13q14 deletion and trisomy 12 similar to that of CLL and showed a skewed repertoire of the immunoglobulin heavy variable group (IGHV) genes. Among 185 subjects presenting with lymphocytosis, progressive lymphocytosis occurred in 51 (28%), progressive CLL developed in 28 (15%), and chemotherapy was required in 13 (7%). The absolute B-cell count was the only independent prognostic factor associated with progressive lymphocytosis. During follow-up over a median of 6.7 years, 34% of subjects (62 of 185) died, but only 4 of these deaths were due to CLL. Age above 68 years and hemoglobin level below 12.5 g per deciliter were the only independent prognostic factors for death.

Conclusions

The CLL-phenotype cells found in the general population and in subjects with lymphocytosis have features in common with CLL cells. CLL requiring treatment develops in subjects with CLL-phenotype MBL and with lymphocytosis at the rate of 1.1% per year.

### A tissue counterpart to monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis [^fb98abf8]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Context —

B-cell clones discovered in tissue biopsies, without overt lymphoma, may represent a tissue counterpart to peripheral blood monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL), herein termed tMBL.

Objective —

To characterize the clinicopathologic features of tMBL.

Design —

During a 10-year period, we retrospectively identified non-bone marrow/peripheral blood cases with monotypic B cells detected by tissue-based flow cytometry but without an identifiable lymphomatous infiltrate on routine histopathology. We excluded cases with prior diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma or MBL.

Results —

Fifty-four cases were identified (35 lymph node, 3 splenic, and 16 soft tissue/viscera). Forty-six cases were CLL-type, 2 were atypical CLL, and 6 were non-CLL. tMBL was detectable by immunohistochemistry in 14 cases (26%, all CLL-type). Concurrent blood flow cytometry, available in 10 cases, showed 4 with low-count MBL (3 CLL-type, 1 with non-CLL-type), 5 with high-count MBL (all CLL-type), and 1 case negative for clonal population. With median follow-up of 51 months, 2 patients had progression of disease (CLL, 68.7 months; and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 5.9 months). Patients with immunohistochemistry-detectable tMBL had increased monoclonal B cells per total lymphocyte events (P = 0.01), morphologic evidence of bone marrow involvement (P = 0.04), higher white blood cell count (P = 0.02), and increased absolute lymphocyte count (P = 0.02).

Conclusions —

tMBL spans an immunophenotypic spectrum similar to MBL, is detectable by immunohistochemistry in a minority of cases (often CLL immunophenotype), and is likely systemic in most cases. Development of overt lymphoma is uncommon but may occur, warranting clinical follow-up.

### Polygenic risk score and risk of monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis in caucasians and risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in African Americans [^7402840b]. Leukemia (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a neoplasm of mature B-cells, with at least 5 × 10⁹ B-cells/L in the peripheral blood. These CLL cells typically co-express CD5, CD19, CD20 dim and CD23, and exhibit a decrease in expression of surface immunoglobulin, CD20, and CD79b as compared to normal B cells. Leukemic B-cells also show restricted expression of either kappa or lambda immunoglobulin light chains featuring the clonal nature of such cells.

Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) is a pre-malignant condition with a clonal absolute B-cell count of < 5 × 10⁹/L in the peripheral blood, with the notable absence of lymphadenopathy, cytopenias, or organomegaly, and an immunophenotype that is similar to that of CLL. MBL is a precursor state to CLL. MBL clones are present in ~5–12% in the general population with the prevalence rising to 15–22% in unaffected first- degree relatives of CLL patients. MBL is also sub-classified into low-count MBL (LC-MBL) or high-count MBL (HC-MBL) according to the B-cell clone size of below or above 0.5 × 10⁹/L threshold, respectively. Other than age, sex, and family history of CLL, little is known about factors associated with risk of MBL.

To date, 41 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been found to be associated with risk of CLL among European ancestry (EA) individuals, and they explain ~25% of the additive heritable risk. We previously showed that a PRS of the weighted average of the number of risk alleles of these 41 SNPs is associated with CLL risk using cases and controls of EA from the International Lymphoma Epidemiology (InterLymph) Consortium. However, these InterLymph cases and controls were used to identify over half of the SNPs, potentially inflating the association. Thus, we evaluated this CLL-PRS in an independent sample of CLL cases and controls from the Genetic Epidemiology of CLL (GEC) Consortium, a cohort of families each with ≥ 2 members with CLL. This analysis demonstrated that CLL-PRS along with age and sex has high discrimination (c-statistic = 0.78) for CLL risk. In these CLL families, we also reported an association of these 41 SNPs and the CLL-PRS with MBL risk in a small cohort of 95 familial MBLs; the vast majority (93%) of these were LC-MBL.

### Diagnostic criteria for monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis [^b47a069d]. British Journal of Haematology (2005). Low credibility.

Very low levels of circulating monoclonal B-cell subpopulations can now be detected in apparently healthy individuals using flow cytometry. We propose the term 'monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis' (MBL) to describe this finding. The aim of this document is to provide a working definition of MBL for future clinical, epidemiological and laboratory studies. We propose that the detection of a monoclonal B-cell population by light chain restriction is sufficient to define this condition in individuals not meeting the diagnostic criteria for other B-lymphoproliferative disorders. The majority of individuals with MBL will have cells that are indistinguishable from chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). However, this blood cell clonal expansion of CD5+ or CD5- B-lymphocytes is age-dependent and immunophenotypic heterogeneity is common. Longitudinal studies are required to determine whether MBL is a precursor state to CLL or other B-lymphoproliferative disease in a situation analogous to a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and myeloma. Future studies of MBL should be directed towards determining its relationship to clinical disease, particularly in individuals from families with a genetic predisposition to developing CLL.

### Immunophenotypic variations in mantle cell lymphoma and their impact on clinical behavior and outcome [^1a8c081e]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Context —

Immunophenotypic variations in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) from the classic CD5 + /CD10 - /CD23 - /FMC-7 + immunophenotype have been reported in the literature, but correlation with clinical behavior and outcome has not been fully studied.

Objective —

To investigate clinicopathologic and prognostic differences between immunophenotypically aberrant MCL and immunophenotypically typical MCL.

Design —

We evaluated differences in clinical presentation, laboratory parameters, prognostic indices, response to initial treatment, and progression-free and overall survival between patients with aberrant MCL and patients with immunophenotypically typical MCL.

Results —

There were 158 patients with newly diagnosed cyclin D1 or t(11;14)(q13; q32) + MCL identified in the original search, of which, 29 patients (18%) showed immunophenotypic aberrancies, with CD23 coexpression being the most common. When compared with 33 randomly selected patients with immunophenotypically typical MCL, statistically significant differences were seen in white blood cell counts (P = 0.02), in the presence of absolute lymphocytosis (P = 0.03), in the MCL International Prognostic Index score (P = 0.02), and in response to initial treatment (P = 0.04). The "immunophenotypic status" of the MCL was the only independent factor associated with response to treatment (P = 0.05), but not with the MCL International Prognostic Index score, absolute lymphocytosis, or white blood cell count. No significant differences were seen for progression-free or overall survival.

Conclusions —

Immunophenotypic variations in MCL are associated with differences in clinical presentation and response to therapy when compared with immunophenotypically typical MCL. However, with current intensive frontline immunochemotherapy, immunophenotypic aberrations do not appear to affect progression-free or overall survival.

### Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis: a reappraisal of its clinical implications [^84334e1c]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2012). Low credibility.

Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) is a recently defined medical condition that displays biological similarities to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common subtype of adult leukemia in the Western world. MBL may be diagnosed in individuals with a normal lymphocyte count via a screening assay (screening MBL) or through the clinical evaluation of lymphocytosis (clinical MBL). Clinical MBL, which resembles CLL with a good prognosis, has attracted considerable interest because of its clinical and biological implications. The biological profile of clinical MBL appears indistinguishable from that of CLL for a large variety of markers. Differential diagnosis between clinical MBL and CLL is mainly based on peripheral blood B-cell counts. The 2008 International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) criteria changed the definition of CLL to a B-cell count ≥ 5.0 × 10(9)/L to eliminate overlap between CLL and MBL. However, this cut-off is arbitrary, and recent studies suggest that a B-cell count of 10.0–11.0 × 10(9)/L may represent the threshold that best predicts time to first treatment. After a diagnosis of clinical MBL, patients should be educated about appropriate monitoring and follow-up keeping in mind that, with time and counseling, most patients will understand that clinical MBL and CLL represent a continuum.

### Common variable immunodeficiency disorders: division into distinct clinical phenotypes [^ab128b14]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

The European Common Variable Immunodeficiency Disorders registry was started in 1996 to define distinct clinical phenotypes and determine overlap within individual patients. A total of 7 centers contributed patient data, resulting in the largest cohort yet reported. Patients (334), validated for the diagnosis, were followed for an average of 25.6 years (9461 patient-years). Data were used to define 5 distinct clinical phenotypes: no complications, autoimmunity, polyclonal lymphocytic infiltration, enteropathy, and lymphoid malignancy. A total of 83% of patients had only one of these phenotypes. Analysis of mortality showed a considerable reduction in the last 15 years and that different phenotypes were associated with different survival times. Types of complications and clinical phenotypes varied significantly between countries, indicating the need for large, international registries. Ages at onset of symptoms and diagnosis were shown to have a Gaussian distribution, but were not useful predictors of phenotype. The only clinical predictor was polyclonal lymphocytic infiltration, which was associated with a 5-fold increased risk of lymphoid malignancy. There was widespread variation in the levels of serum immunoglobulin isotypes as well as in the percentages and absolute numbers of B cells, confirming the heterogeneity of these conditions. Higher serum IgM and lower circulating CD8 proportions were found to be predictive markers for polyclonal lymphocytic infiltration and autoimmunity, respectively.

### Single-cell analysis reveals oligoclonality among' low-count' monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis [^5735922e]. Leukemia (2010). Low credibility.

Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) is a preclinical hematologic syndrome characterized by small accumulations of CD5(+) B lymphocytes. Most MBL share phenotypic characteristics with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Although some MBL progress to CLL, most MBL have apparently limited potential for progression to CLL, particularly those MBL with normal absolute B-cell counts ('low-count' MBL). Most CLL are monoclonal and it is not known whether MBL are monoclonal or oligoclonal; this is important because it is unclear whether MBL represent indolent CLL or represent a distinct premalignant precursor before the development of CLL. We used flow cytometry analysis and sorting to determine immunophenotypic characteristics, clonality and molecular features of MBL from familial CLL kindreds. Single-cell analysis indicated four of six low-count MBL consisted of two or more unrelated clones; the other two MBL were monoclonal. 87% of low-count MBL clones had mutated immunoglobulin genes, and no immunoglobulin heavy-chain rearrangements of V(H) family 1 were observed. Some MBL were diversified, clonally related populations with evidence of antigen drive. We conclude that although low-count MBL share many phenotypic characteristics with CLL, many MBL are oligoclonal. This supports a model for step-wise development of MBL into CLL.

### T-cell clonality is detected in a high frequency among patients with incidental lymphocytosis by PCR assays for TCR gene rearrangements [^f2744820]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

Clonal expansion of lymphocytes may account for asymptomatic lymphocytosis. Unlike monoclonal B lymphocytosis, the detection of T-cell clones is difficult using immunophenotype-based assays. This study aimed to evaluate PCR-based clonality assays for the identification of T-cell clones among patients with unexplained lymphocytosis.

Methods

We incorporated the BIOMED-2 multiplex PCR into the investigation of peripheral lymphocytosis. Clonality analysis was performed with three reactions for TCRβ and two reactions for TCRγ gene rearrangements. The analysis was performed with blood specimens from a total of 150 adult patients who presented with incidental lymphocytosis.

Results

PCR assays were validated using confirmed T-cell malignancies and the detection sensitivity was determined at a level of 2%. Using the TCRβ and TCRγ combination, 25 (16.6%) of 150 patients were found to have clonal TCR arrangement. Patients who harboured clonal T cells presented with a mild to moderate absolute lymphocytosis, with a median lymphocyte count of 4.5 × 10⁹/l (range 3.7–9.8 × 10⁹) and the absence of other haematological abnormalities. Immunophenotyping confirmed T-cell lymphocytosis with an increase in CD8 T cells in the majority of patients.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated the use of PCR assays for the effective detection of clonal T lymphocytosis. Our data indicate a high prevalence of silent T-cell clones among patients with peripheral lymphocytosis.

Nonspecific screening tests for cellular immune competency — Summary Statement 148 states that simple, cost-effective tests include an absolute lymphocyte count, the absolute number of CD4+ T cells, and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio (B). For abnormality thresholds, an absolute lymphocyte count less than 1,200/mm3 suggests an abnormal immune response. Additional evaluative measures include number of total T cells measured by anti-CD3 surface markers; estimation of CD4+ helper and CD8+ cytotoxic populations by immunofluorescence staining with appropriate phenotypic cell markers; measurement of T-cell activation by IL-2 secretion or fluorescent anti-CD25 and/or anti–HLA-DR monoclonal antibodies; determination of CD45 RO+ CD29+ T-cell lymphocytes as an indication of memory cells; and measurement of CD4+, CD25+ Fox P3+ immunoregulatory T cells, and the latter cells may be increased after successful allergen immunotherapy.

### Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis and early-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia: diagnosis, natural history, and risk stratification [^54641e4c]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

Monoclonal B lymphocytosis (MBL) is defined as the presence of a clonal B-cell population in the peripheral blood with fewer than 5 × 10(9)/L B-cells and no other signs of a lymphoproliferative disorder. The majority of cases of MBL have the immunophenotype of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). MBL can be categorized as either low count or high count based on whether the B-cell count is above or below 0.5 × 10⁹/L. Low-count MBL can be detected in ∼5% of adults over the age of 40 years when assessed using standard-sensitivity flow cytometry assays. A number of biological and genetic characteristics distinguish low-count from high-count MBL. Whereas low-count MBL rarely progresses to CLL, high-count MBL progresses to CLL requiring therapy at a rate of 1% to 2% per year. High-count MBL is distinguished from Rai 0 CLL based on whether the B-cell count is above or below 5 × 10⁹/L. Although individuals with both high-count MBL and CLL Rai stage 0 are at increased risk of infections and second cancers, the risk of progression requiring treatment and the potential to shorten life expectancy are greater for CLL. This review highlights challenging questions regarding the classification, risk stratification, management, and supportive care of patients with MBL and CLL.

### Low-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis persists after seven years of follow up and is associated with a poorer outcome [^49fb5de5]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical and biological characteristics of CLL-like MBL lo at baseline vs. follow-up, according to the kinetics of the B-cell clone

Upon comparing CLL-like MBL lo cases with increased vs. stable/decreased clonal B-cell numbers at seven years follow-up, the former had a similar male/female distribution, but they were significantly younger (median age: 68y vs. 78y; Table 4).

Table 4.
Clinical and biological characteristics of CLL-like MBL lo subjects at baseline and at follow-up (+7 years) according to the kinetics of the MBL clone in PB (decreased/stable vs. increased size).

Strikingly, MBL lo cases who showed larger CLL-like clone sizes over time also showed significantly higher (P < 0.05) numbers of the distinct normal residual T-, B- and NK-cell subsets at follow-up (vs. baseline) (Table 4). Moreover, in these subjects a direct correlation was observed between the absolute number of clonal B cells and CD4 + CD8 − T cells (r² = 0.5; P = 0.001). In contrast, no significant (P > 0.05) association was found between higher numbers of clonal CLL-like B cells in PB over time, and an increased frequency of cytogenetic alterations. Interestingly, del(13q14) was the sole genetic alteration detected at the seven year follow-up within cases with stable/decreased CLL-like B-cell clones, while those cases with increased CLL-like B-cell clones at year +7 showed cytogenetic alterations other than del(13q14), e.g. trisomy 12 (1/40), del(17p)(TP53) (1/39) and t(14q32) (5/20 cases tested) (Table 4).

### Clonal evolution is a prognostic factor for the clinical progression of monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis [^c6f9ada0]. Blood Cancer Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Of the remaining variables, only clonal evolution was independently associated with a high risk of progression to clinical disease (hazards ratio: 2.25, 95% CI:1.16–4.38 P = 0.017). Since clonal evolution was mainly detected in the CLL-like cases, risk analysis was restricted to this subset for better homogeneity, although statistical significance was not affected when all cases were included. In particular, individuals with clonal evolution had a shorter time-to-progression (median: 44 months), when compared to those who were cytogenetically stable (median: 82 months, P < 0.001, Figure 1e). Interestingly, the presence of clonal evolution could clearly discriminate between two subgroups with significantly different risks of progression among patients at the intermediate-risk category according to B-cell count (2000–3900 B-cells/μl) (median time: 47 vs 77 months, P < 0.001) (Figure 1f). Finally, the negative impact of this parameter was also identified in time-to-treatment analysis, since cases with clonal evolution at the preclinical stage, showed both an increased rate for treatment requirement in our monitoring period and a significant shorter time-to-treatment when compared with the rest of the cohort (Figure 1g).

In summary, the three phenotypically defined MBL groups have distinct characteristics, but seem to share common features involved in clinical progression. Certain chromosome aberrations occur early in the transformation process but do not seem to affect the risk of progression to the clinical state. On the other hand, the apparent genomic instability, manifested by the acquisition of additional abnormalities, together with increased initial B-cell counts are the strongest determinants of disease progression. The combination of these two variables could better stratify MBL subjects into more precise prognostic subgroups.

### Monoclonal B lymphocytosis in the general population [^7f035a40]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2009). Low credibility.

Monoclonal B lymphocytosis (MBL) is a frequent phenomenon in the general population. Despite a phenotype similar to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the possibility exists that most cases are not necessarily a pre-leukemic condition. This is suggested by the fact that MBL is at least 100 times more frequent than CLL and the diagnosis of CLL is not an inevitable fate, even among MBL cases with lymphocytosis, where it occurs only in 1.1% of the cases per year. The high incidence of MBL, if coupled with the possibility of evolution into a frank leukemic state, poses evident clinical and health system concerns. MBL in the general population usually accounts for a very low number of all circulating B-cells, being < 10% of all B lymphocytes. This creates the need for a better characterisation of MBL at molecular level, aiming to identify biological features that may define which cases are more likely to progress towards clinically overt CLL. This approach should also help to avoid unnecessary and prolonged follow-ups in all individuals carrying MBL, excluding those who are extremely unlikely to develop CLL.

### Association of polygenic risk score with the risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis [^4614af5c]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Inherited loci have been found to be associated with risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). A combined polygenic risk score (PRS) of representative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from these loci may improve risk prediction over individual SNPs. Herein, we evaluated the association of a PRS with CLL risk and its precursor, monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL). We assessed its validity and discriminative ability in an independent sample and evaluated effect modification and confounding by family history (FH) of hematological cancers. For discovery, we pooled genotype data on 41 representative SNPs from 1499 CLL and 2459 controls from the InterLymph Consortium. For validation, we used data from 1267 controls from Mayo Clinic and 201 CLL, 95 MBL, and 144 controls with a FH of CLL from the Genetic Epidemiology of CLL Consortium. We used odds ratios (ORs) to estimate disease associations with PRS and c-statistics to assess discriminatory accuracy. In InterLymph, the continuous PRS was strongly associated with CLL risk (OR, 2.49; P = 4.4 × 10–94). We replicated these findings in the Genetic Epidemiology of CLL Consortium and Mayo controls (OR, 3.02; P = 7.8 × 10–30) and observed high discrimination (c-statistic = 0.78). When jointly modeled with FH, PRS retained its significance, along with FH status. Finally, we found a highly significant association of the continuous PRS with MBL risk (OR, 2.81; P = 9.8 × 10–16). In conclusion, our validated PRS was strongly associated with CLL risk, adding information beyond FH. The PRS provides a means of identifying those individuals at greater risk for CLL as well as those at increased risk of MBL, a condition that has potential clinical impact beyond CLL.

### State of the art biology, progression, and clinical management of monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL): consensus report from the intercepting blood cancers workshop committee [^d69cd25a]. Blood Cancer Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Overview of the biology of MBL

MBL has historically been defined as a monoclonal population of B lymphocytes with a CLL phenotype comprising < 5 × 10⁹/liter in the peripheral blood, persisting for at least 3 months, without other features of a B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, such as lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, cytopenias, or extramedullary involvement. The delineating threshold for high-count versus low-count MBL has traditionally been defined as greater than or less than 0.5 × 10⁹ monoclonal B-cells/liter in the peripheral blood. The Genetic Epidemiology of CLL (GEC) consortium and the Mayo Clinic have produced two seminal studies on the epidemiology of MBL. In the GEC cohort, 1045 relatives from 310 families with two or more members with CLL were screened for MBL, and 22% were identified to have MBL. Notably, when considering only individuals with low-count MBL, the 5-year cumulative incidence was 5.7%, with a rate of progression to CLL (i.e. to presence of > 5 × 10⁹/l monoclonal B cells) of ~1.1% per year. In the Mayo Clinic MBL Biobank cohort, over 10,000 individuals aged 40 and older were screened, with 17% identified as having MBL and the 5-year cumulative incidence of lymphoid cancer was 2.7%.

Recent genomic analyses have also identified that inherited variants likely play a role in the onset of MBL and its progression to CLL. A polygenic risk score (PRS) integrating 41 CLL susceptibility single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the largest genome wide association study (GWAS) of CLL was found to associate with an ~2.5-fold increased risk of CLL, as well as with an odds ratio of 1.75 and 2.14 for risk of low-count and high-count MBL, respectively. As reviewed at the meeting (Slager, IBC 2023), a subset of the identified CLL susceptibility SNPs may be associated with the initial development of the malignant B-cell clone, while another subset may be associated with subsequent MBL progression. Further delineation of these subsets may help to better predict risk of both MBL development and progression, both of which may have important clinical implications.

### Prognostic value of leukocytosis and lymphopenia for coronavirus disease severity [^17d653b0]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The Study

We searched 3 major databases — MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) — for clinical studies published December 1, 2019, through March 28, 2020. To broadly identify studies detailing lymphocyte and leukocyte testing among patients with COVID-19, we used the following search criteria: "(COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR 2019-NCoV OR HCov-19 OR novel coronavirus) AND (laboratory OR WBC OR lymphocyte)". We prioritized studies that measured lymphocyte and leukocyte counts among patients who had severe or critical cases versus those with mild cases. Severe cases were defined as significant respiratory distress (acute hypoxic respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, need for mechanical ventilation, or intensive care unit admission) caused by COVID-19.

Our meta-analysis included articles about studies and clinical trials that met the following 4 inclusion criteria: 1) involved adult, human patients; 2) written in English; 3) reported lymphocyte and leukocyte counts for patients; and 4) compared patients with severe versus mild illness. Our meta-analysis excluded articles about studies with the following 9 characteristics: 1) involved nonhuman subjects; 2) written in a language other than English; 3) were not a clinical trial, such as a review paper or letter; 4) were out of the scope of the study question detailed above; 5) did not provide raw data to perform quantitative meta-analysis; 6) involved pediatric patients; 7) did not have the full article available; 8) were duplicates; and 9) were ongoing or not completed.

### Low-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis persists after seven years of follow up and is associated with a poorer outcome [^874e40ec]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

The detection of MBL lo has become routinely feasible due to the use of highly sensitive flow cytometry (FCM) approaches for the screening of subjects from the general population who present normal blood cell counts. Of note, the prevalence of MBL lo is significantly higher than that of MBL hi and CLL, with a frequency that ranges between 3% and 14% of the general adult (≥ 40y) population, depending on the sensitivity of the FCM technique used. Independently of the method, it is well-established that the incidence of MBL lo progressively increases with age, with a prevalence > 20% among individuals of more than 70 years of age. Whether MBL lo represents the normal counterpart of CLL (e.g. some studies suggest that MBL lo clones are more likely related to immunosenescence)or a very early stage of development of CLL, remains an open question. This is partially because, in contrast to MBL hi, long-term follow-up studies in large series of MBL lo cases have not been reported thus far, which limits our understanding of the biological and clinical significance of very low numbers of circulating CLL-like clones, as well as those factors and mechanisms involved in potential long-term progression of (conceivably) a minor proportion of all MBL lo cases to MBL hi and CLL; likewise, little information is available about the evolution of non CLL-like MBL. Such information is critical to a better understanding of the ontogenesis of CLL from the very early stages of the disease, and to better identify MBL patients with stable vs. progressive B-cell lymphocytosis who might benefit from a closer clinical follow-up.

Herein, we report on a cohort of 91 MBL lo (CLL-like and non CLL-like) subjects identified in a population-based screening study and followed for a minimum of five years (median > seven years). Our primary goal was to determine the rate of medium-term progression of MBL lo to MBL hi and CLL, and to identify the most relevant clinical and biological characteristics of PB lymphocytes associated with progression.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^67509b12]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Panel discussion and contextual use of BAL lymphocytosis in hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP): Evidence of the diagnostic utility of BAL fluid analysis in HP from observational studies is of very low quality, and due to bias and absent diagnostic accuracy measures, meta-analysis of its discriminative ability in fibrotic disease was not possible; nevertheless, the literature suggests that the diagnostic accuracy lies in the positive predictive value of lymphocytosis, and BAL analysis may be appropriate in subjects with a multidisciplinary discussion (MDD) consensus working diagnosis of fibrotic HP, with a high BAL lymphocyte count potentially adjusting the MDD probability enough to alter management or prompt video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) or transbronchial cryobiopsy (TBC), while acknowledging no studies combine BAL with pretest MDD probability and that diagnostic value is tethered to clinical and radiological integration; despite very low confidence in diagnostic yield, the recommendation places a high value on establishing HP diagnosis in a stepwise approach.

### Lymphocytosis and lymphopenia induced by imported infectious diseases: a controlled cross-sectional study of 17, 229 diseased German travelers returning from the tropics and subtropics [^51055df2]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

The present controlled cross-sectional study aimed to assess relative and absolute lymphocytosis and lymphopenia induced by imported infectious diseases (IDs) seen among patients consulting the Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, Medical Center of the University of Munich (1999–2014) after being in the tropics and subtropics. The analysis investigated data sets from 17,229 diseased German travelers returning from Latin America (3,238), Africa (5,467), and Asia (8,524), and from 1,774 healthy controls who had not recently traveled. Among the cases, the proportion of those with relative lymphopenia (10.5%) and absolute lymphopenia (8.0%) was significantly higher than among controls (3.2% and 3.6%, respectively), whereas relative lymphocytosis was significantly lower among cases (6.1%) than among controls (8.0%). The study identified IDs with significantly larger proportions of relative lymphocytosis (cytomegalovirus [CMV] infection [56%], infectious mononucleosis [51%], and dengue fever [11%]); absolute lymphocytosis (infectious mononucleosis [70%] and CMV infection [63%]); relative lymphopenia (streptococcal pharyngitis [56%], malaria [34%], Campylobacter infection [19%], salmonellosis [18%], and shigellosis [17%]); and of absolute lymphopenia (human immunodeficiency virus infection [53%], malaria [45%], dengue fever [40%], salmonellosis [16%], and Campylobacter infection [11%]). This study demonstrates that relative and absolute lymphocytosis and lymphopenia are useful laboratory findings for travelers returning from the tropics and subtropics, as they are typically caused by imported viral, bacterial, and protozoan IDs.

### Overview of monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis [^b07b2da8]. British Journal of Haematology (2007). Low credibility.

Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) has been the subject of more intensive investigation for the last 10 years. The increased presence of MBL in unaffected, first-degree relatives with familial chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) suggest that it is surrogate marker for early disease. In normal population studies, MBL is found to be increased in ageing subjects. Consensus criteria for the diagnosis of MBL have been proposed. The differential diagnosis has been further clarified and the prevalence of MBL is most prominent in the elderly. The aetiology of MBL is unknown but probably involves immune mechanism of senescence or altered response. Environmental health studies suggest that exposure to certain toxins may lead to MBL but further work is needed. MBL is a precursor to CLL but may also regress, remain stable or progress to clinical CLL.

### Why does my patient have leukocytosis? [^63420681]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis is one of the most common laboratory abnormalities in medicine, and one of the most frequent reasons for hematologic consultation. Effective evaluation of leukocytosis requires an attentive history, careful physical examination, meticulous review of the complete blood count and peripheral blood smear, judicious application of laboratory and radiologic testing, and thoughtful analysis. Definitive diagnosis may require bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, imaging studies, and specialized molecular tests. The differential diagnosis of leukocytosis includes physiologic responses to a broad range of infectious and inflammatory processes, as well as numerous primary hematologic disorders such as leukemias, lymphomas, and myeloproliferative neoplasms.

### Prognostic value of leukocytosis and lymphopenia for coronavirus disease severity [^80faa20b]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly globally; as of March 29, 2020, ≈670,000 cases had been confirmed worldwide. COVID-19 is typically a pulmonary infection that can range from mild illness to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure; however, other symptoms such as myalgias and anorexia have been noted. Although many ongoing studies are investigating measurement of proinflammatory cytokines and other biomarkers as a way to prognosticate infection severity, we investigated use of 2 easily obtained predictors: lymphopenia and leukocytosis.

### Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL): biology, natural history and clinical management [^0b0a13d2]. Leukemia (2010). Low credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and the other low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphomas are among the most common lymphoid malignancies. Recent studies suggest that more than 4% of the general population over age 40 harbor a population of clonal B cells with the phenotype of either CLL or another B-cell malignancy, a condition now designated monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL). Although all cases of CLL appear to be preceded by MBL, the majority of individuals with MBL will not develop a hematologic malignancy. The biologic characteristics and clinical implications of MBL appear to differ based on whether it is identified during the diagnostic evaluation of lymphocytosis or incidentally discovered through screening of individuals with normal lymphocyte counts as part of research studies using highly sensitive detection methods. In this paper, we provide a state of the art review on the prevalence, nomenclature, biology, natural history and clinical management of MBL.

### Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis [^2b5a66f5]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2009). Low credibility.

The incidence and presenting features of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have changed significantly over the last century. Routine diagnostic techniques can now detect very low levels of CLL phenotype cells. Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) is a relatively recent diagnostic category encapsulating individuals with an abnormal B-cell population but not meeting the diagnostic criteria for a B-cell malignancy. This review focuses on CLL-type MBL, which represents the majority of MBL cases identified in diagnostic laboratories. CLL-type MBL has a phenotype identical to CLL and shares the same chromosomal abnormalities even at the lowest levels detectable. Recent evidence suggests that the immunoglobulin gene usage plays a key role in whether the abnormal cells will develop in significant numbers. In most cases, CLL-type MBL is a stable condition with only 1% per year among those presenting for clinical attention developing progressive disease requiring treatment, although suppressed immune function may have a more significant impact on outcome.

### Modulated expression of adhesion, migration and activation molecules may predict the degree of response in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients treated with ibrutinib plus rituximab [^a3de2c4c]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Lymphocytosis was observed in 36 of the 119 CLL patients (30.3%), with D0 vs. D14 absolute lymphocyte counts being 42.6 ± 26.4 × 10⁹/L vs. 92.8 ± 57.3 × 10⁹/L, respectively (P < 0.00001). The lymphocytosis appeared associated with the downmodulation of at least four antigens (P = 0.050), independently of the type of antigens involved. No significant differences in antigen modulation were recorded according to the presence (36/119 cases) or absence (83/119 cases) of lymphocytosis, suggesting that ibrutinib-mediated inhibition of microenvironmental interactions could not always turn into an increase in absolute lymphocyte count, probably because of the cytotoxic effect on both tissue-resident and mobilized CLL cells. Accordingly, when CLL patients were subdivided on the basis of level of CD20 expression into those with higher (CD20 high MFI ≥ 1000, n = 62/119) or lower (CD20 low MFI < 1000, n = 57/119) expression, CD20 high cases showed both a greater clearance of CLL cells (CLL median absolute cell counts on D14 in CD20 high vs. CD20 low cases: 38.9 ± 46.7 × 10⁹/L vs. 58.3 ± 48.6 × 10⁹/L, P = 0.030) (Figure 2B) and a lower incidence of lymphocytosis (15/62 [24.6%] vs. 21/57 [36.8%], P = 0.083) on D14. In addition, CD20 high CLL samples were characterized by a significantly greater downmodulation of CD38, CD44, CD49d and CD62L antigens (Figure 2C), suggesting that these cells may be more prone to mobilize into the periphery and be exposed to monoclonal antibody-mediated killing.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in 2020: the future has arrived [^cf8869bc]. Current Oncology Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

When to Initiate Treatment

In addition to diagnostic criteria, the iwCLL guidelines dictate when to initiate treatment, based on patients' symptoms, full blood counts and physical examination. The presence of constitutional symptoms, progressive lymphocytosis, a doubling time of less than 6 months, an Hb of less than 100 g/L or a platelet count of less than 100 x 10 9 /L as well as progressive or symptomatic bulky lymphadenopathy/organomegaly or treatment-resistant autoimmune thrombocytopaenia or anaemia are indications to start treatment. In some circumstances, treatment may be initiated at diagnosis, but it is much more common for patient to be monitored for signs of increasing disease activity often over many years.

### Flow cytometric, morphologic, and laboratory comparative study in patients with leukocytosis and cytopenia [^8c0cf46c]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of flow cytometry immunophenotyping (FCI) as a screening test for patients with leukocytosis and cytopenia.

Methods

We identified 320 patients during August 2016 to December 2016 and evaluated FCI and morphology of peripheral blood smears (PBSs).

Results

The most common indications for FCI included history of hematologic malignancy (HHM, n = 126), leukocytosis (n = 80), and cytopenia (n = 53). Positive FCI rate was low with a range of 4.4% to 12.5% in patients with absolute neutrophilia regardless of HHM, if cases with circulating blasts were excluded. Patients with absolute lymphocytosis had a 93% positive FCI rate. Patients with HHM and pancytopenia showed a higher incidence of positive FCI findings than patients without HHM and with isolated cytopenia. PBS morphology correlated strongly with FCI (P = 0.0001).

Conclusion

PBS evaluation is an accurate and cost-effective screening test. FCI for patients with mature neutrophilia and isolated cytopenia has a very low yield.

### Inherited genetic susceptibility to monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis [^66fd8018]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) is detectable in > 3% of the general population. Recent data are compatible, at least in a proportion of cases, with MBL being a progenitor lesion for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and a surrogate for inherited predisposition. Common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 2q13 (rs17483466), 2q37.1 (rs13397985), 2q37.3 (rs757978), 6p25.3 (rs872071), 8q24.21 (rs2456449), 11q24.1 (rs735665), 15q21.3 (rs7169431), 15q23 (rs7176508), 16q24.1 (rs305061), and 19q13.32 (rs11083846) have been shown to confer a modest but significant increase in CLL risk. To examine the impact of these 10 SNPs on MBL, we analyzed 3 case-control series totaling 419 cases and 1753 controls. An association between genotype and MBL risk was seen for 9 SNPs, 6 of which were statistically significant: rs17483466 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.27; P = 0.02), rs13397985 (OR = 1.40; P = 1.72 × 10(-3)), rs757978 (OR = 1.38; P = 0.02), rs872071 (OR = 1.27; P = 7.75 × 10(-3)), rs2456449 (OR = 1.31; P = 3.14 × 10(-3)), and rs735665 (OR = 1.63; P = 6.86 × 10(-6)). Collectively, these data provide support for genetic variation influencing CLL risk through predisposition to MBL.

### Hematologic differences in heterophile-positive and heterophile-negative infectious mononucleosis [^5b37ffa0]. American Journal of Hematology (2004). Low credibility.

Infectious mononucleosis (IM) due to all causes is characterized by atypical lymphocytosis. We sought to compare hematologic parameters of infectious mononucleosis due to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection (heterophile antibody (HA) positive) with mononucleosis due to other causes. Mono-Latex Slide Agglutination Test results and complete blood counts (CBC) of 147 patients with mononucleosis were retrospectively analyzed. Leukocyte count, absolute lymphocyte count, and presence of atypical lymphocytes in EBV-positive and EBV-negative groups were statistically compared. We analyzed 68 EBV-positive and 79 EBV-negative cases. EBV-positive patients were significantly younger than EBV-negative patients were. Mean total WBC count and mean absolute lymphocyte count were significantly higher in EBV-positive patients. Absolute lymphocytosis, absolute leukocytosis, and atypical lymphocytosis were also significantly more frequent in EBV-positive patients. Leukopenia was more frequently seen in EBV-negative patients.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^86d963cc]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) diagnosis — bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL): For patients with suspected HP who have a compelling exposure history within the appropriate clinical context and a chest HRCT pattern typical for HP, we suggest not routinely using BAL fluid analysis to confirm a diagnosis of HP (Weak Recommendation, Very Low-Quality Evidence). BAL fluid analysis can narrow the differential diagnosis by excluding competing causes, particularly in nonfibrotic HP (eg, infection), but in patients with a high pretest probability of HP, the BAL cellular differential generally does not significantly alter the post-test probability and as a result adds little additional diagnostic information. In the appropriate clinical context, a history of clinically relevant exposure to a compelling IA with a typical high-resolution CT pattern allows for a confident diagnosis of HP. Lymphocytic alveolitis is not consistently present in patients with fibrotic HP, and BAL fluid lymphocytosis is not sufficiently sensitive or specific to rule in or rule out the diagnosis of fibrotic HP; however, BAL fluid lymphocytosis may increase diagnostic confidence when the IA is identified and HRCT findings are compatible with HP and should be considered when the exposure history and imaging data are discordant, and may exclude common alternative diagnoses, such as IPF, when the lymphocyte differential count is high (eg, ≥ 40%).

### Host virus and pneumococcus-specific immune responses in high-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis and chronic lymphocytic leukemia: implications for disease progression [^dd299f55]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Infection is one of the most frequent causes of death in CLL (approx. 30–50% of CLL patients). Although the specific mechanisms underlying immune dysregulation in CLL are not fully understood, hypogammaglobulinemia, together with T-cell abnormalities, are common features of the CLL-associated immunodeficiency status, the former affecting up to 85% of the patients already at diagnosis or during the course of their disease. The frequency and severity of hypogammaglobulinemia (at the expense of all major Ig isotypes) increase from MBL subjects to early and advanced stage CLL patients. Here, we confirm and extend on these observations. Thus, we show for the first time that total soluble Ig plasma levels are within normal values in MBL lo subjects, regardless of the Ig isotype evaluated; in contrast, hypogammaglobulinemia was a relatively frequent feature of MBL hi cases. Of note, the degree of decreased IgM and IgG plasma levels in MBL hi was similar to that observed in stage A CLL. In a recent study, Glancy et al. have even reported a higher frequency of decreased IgG levels in MBL hi (i.e. 7 of 24 MBL hi cases, which represents a frequency of IgG hypogammaglobulinemia of 29% vs. 14% in our series). This apparent discrepancy might be due to the fact that our series mostly comprised MBL hi cases with lower numbers of clonal B cells studied at diagnosis, while 4 of 7 MBL hi cases reported by Glancy et al. to have low IgG titers, had absolute lymphocyte counts more than 4×10⁹/L. Nevertheless, it should be noted that we did not find any correlation between soluble Ig plasma levels and the number of clonal B cells in PB, within each group of subjects analyzed (data not shown). In contrast, a statistically significant direct correlation was found between total Ig plasma levels and the number of normal residual B cells among CLL patients (r = 0.29, P = 0.04). Therefore, presence of hypogammaglobulinemia in MBL hi cases could also reflect a defective normal residual B-cell function and it might contribute to explain the near 3-fold increased frequency of infection observed among these subjects versus the general population of the same age and having the same comorbidities, to that of newly-diagnosed CLL. Altogether, these findings suggest that antibody-related immunodeficiency might emerge before the onset of CLL, already at an MBL hi state, preceding (or potentially favoring) malignant transformation and progression of the disease.

### Why does my patient have lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly? [^64a525be]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Lymph node or spleen enlargement may be innocent or the first sign of a serious disorder. Lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly can be found in symptomatic or asymptomatic patients. Lymph node enlargement in a single region or multiple sites can be seen in various diseases, including infections, noninfectious inflammatory conditions, or malignancies; a similar differential diagnosis applies to splenomegaly, but splenomegaly can also be caused by vascular abnormalities and hemolysis. Frequently, lymphadenopathy is detected incidentally during screening examinations or imaging procedures. This review focuses on causes of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly and an appropriate diagnostic approach to patients with lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly.

### Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis in the bone marrow: revisiting the criteria for chronic lymphocytic leukemia / small lymphocytic lymphoma [^b5663522]. Human Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis is a clonal B-cell population in the peripheral blood (PB) of < 5 × 10⁹/L without extramedullary (EM) disease, often with a chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) phenotype. The degree of bone marrow (BM) involvement is not currently a part of the diagnostic criteria for MBL or CLL/SLL, but CLL-type MBLs in BM can be seen in patients lacking PB lymphocytosis. Data are limited on the outcome of such cases. We assessed the clinicopathologic characteristics of isolated BM CLL-type MBL in patients who did not meet criteria for CLL/SLL. We evaluated BMs from 2006 to 2018 with CLL-like clonal B-cell populations in patients with a PB absolute lymphocyte count or monoclonal B-cell count of < 5 × 10 9 /L and without definite evidence of EM disease. We investigated the extent and pattern of marrow involvement, PB counts, flow cytometric data, genetics, concurrent hematopoietic diseases, and outcomes including progression and treatment. Thirty cases with BM MBL but < 5 × 10⁹/L PB monoclonal B cells and no EM disease were identified. Thirteen of 30 had additional hematopoietic neoplasms. The mean patient age was 74.1 years (median: 77 years, range: 43–91 years). No patients had lymphadenopathy (LAD) or splenomegaly by physical examination. By imaging, nine of 18 had LAD (8/9 < 1.5 cm) and four of 18 had splenomegaly but with other attributable etiologies. Mean PB absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) was 1.8 × 10⁹/L (range: 0.5–5.0 × 10⁹/L). Twenty-four of 30 (80%) had low-level (< 20%) BM involvement by MBL, and among these, none with available follow-up data progressed to diagnostic CLL/SLL. Six of 30 (20%) had > 20% marrow involvement by MBL. Four of 6 were treated for CLL/SLL due to cytopenias, despite not meeting diagnostic criteria, and all 4 were CD38 or ZAP70 positive and had cytogenetic abnormalities, including trisomy 12. One of 6 developed overt CLL/SLL 3 years later and had cytogenetic abnormalities at the time of MBL diagnosis. One of 6 was monitored without treatment but had no cytogenetic abnormalities. Isolated BM CLL-type MBL represents a diagnostic gray area, and this study highlights the range of clinical outcomes. All cases with < 20% BM involvement did not require CLL-specific treatment or progress to CLL/SLL. In the 4 cases where treatment was initiated due to cytopenias, patients had ≥ 20% BM involvement, CD38 or ZAP70 expression, and cytogenetic abnormalities but lacked a PB ALC of ≥ 5 × 10⁹/L or LAD ≥ 1.5 cm, suggesting that not all patients with clinically significant disease will meet criteria for CLL/SLL. The results also show that concurrent hematopoietic disorders can complicate the diagnosis, as the disease course or treatment may result in leukopenia, precluding PB absolute lymphocytosis. Though larger studies are needed, the degree of BM involvement, in conjunction with flow cytometric prognostic markers, and cytogenetic abnormalities may be a useful addition to the current diagnostic criteria for CLL/SLL which only considers a PB numerical cutoff and EM involvement.

### Pre-diagnostic trajectories of lymphocytosis predict time to treatment and death in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^77764a56]. Communications Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We know that CLL is detectable years before the diagnosis of CLL by flow cytometry and DNA-based methods. We here demonstrate that the kinetics of the CLL clone in terms of lymphocytosis prior to diagnosis of CLL carries important prognostic information and correlates with underlying genetic aberrations by which the disease evolves. We identified that the average accumulation of CLL cells is detectable and measurable 3 years before diagnosis and the slope of the lymphocyte count prior to diagnosis is independently associated with the risk of treatment. In addition, different growth patterns prior to diagnosis correlate to some degree with the growth kinetics after diagnosis as described by Gruber and colleagues. Furthermore, both pre-diagnostic and post-diagnostic growth kinetics could be correlated with genetic phenotype at diagnosis of CLL.

Over the past three decades, the results of several studies have shown that MBL and CLL are closely related consecutive conditions with MBL being present years prior to diagnosis of CLL. Specifically, MBL has been demonstrated up to 77 months in advance of CLL diagnosis and serum immunoglobulin abnormalities up to 112 months (or 9 years) before CLL diagnosis. However, MBL does not always progress to CLL, as evidenced by the high prevalence of MBL among the elderly and among relatives of CLL patients in particular. MBL can be demonstrated in approximately 5% at age 40+ years and in 12% of persons above 65 years of age. While it is currently not possible to predict whether a person with MBL eventually progresses to CLL, the detailed temporal trajectory of pre-diagnostic lymphocytosis is consistent with the notion that the clone develops many years before diagnosis and the kinetics of the pre-diagnostic lymphocytosis hold prognostic information. This is in line with our recent report that overall antimicrobial use gradually increases among CLL patients from six years before diagnosis, thus emphasizing the co-occurrence of the premalignant clone and immune dysfunction.

### Evaluation of patients with leukocytosis [^8517e656]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

An elevated white blood cell count has many potential etiologies, including malignant and nonmalignant causes. It is important to use age- and pregnancy-specific normal ranges for the white blood cell count. A repeat complete blood count with peripheral smear may provide helpful information, such as types and maturity of white blood cells, uniformity of white blood cells, and toxic granulations. The leukocyte differential may show eosinophilia in parasitic or allergic conditions, or it may reveal lymphocytosis in childhood viral illnesses. Leukocytosis is a common sign of infection, particularly bacterial, and should prompt physicians to identify other signs and symptoms of infection. The peripheral white blood cell count can double within hours after certain stimuli because of the large bone marrow storage and intravascularly marginated pools of neutrophils. Stressors capable of causing an acute leukocytosis include surgery, exercise, trauma, and emotional stress. Other nonmalignant etiologies of leukocytosis include certain medications, asplenia, smoking, obesity, and chronic inflammatory conditions. Symptoms suggestive of a hematologic malignancy include fever, weight loss, bruising, or fatigue. If malignancy cannot be excluded or another more likely cause is not suspected, referral to a hematologist/oncologist is indicated.

### Is immune effector cell-associated enterocolitis a CAR T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder? [^ad40b6cd]. Blood Cancer Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

As for clonality, we also want to point out a possible diagnostic pitfall depicted in Figure 2 in the paper. Here, the assumption is that lymphoma can be ruled out based on the presence of both CD8+ and CD8- T cells. This may lead to diagnostic oversight. Hosoya et al. documented a bi-clonal lymphoma with one major CD8+ and minor CD4+ clone. Braun et al. documented three different clones in their patient. These cases demonstrate that this argument is not absolute. Given the serious implications of diagnosing CAR T-cell lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disorder as immune-mediated/autoimmune enterocolitis, and the delays in appropriate management and the risk of secondary infections such as CMV reactivation (reported in two CAR T-cell lymphoma cases following steroid and infliximab therapy), we strongly advocate for a more cautious approach in the assessment of such cases.

Additionally, we would like to further discuss one of the proposed mechanisms for the gastrointestinal involvement of BCMA CAR T-cells. The article suggests that this phenomenon may be due to BCMA expression on plasma cells, which are densely populated in enteric tissue. However, in our patient, plasma cells and B cells were notably depleted, and they were absent in the follow-up biopsies. Despite their absence, CAR T-cells still accumulated in the small intestine. Similar findings have been observed in other reported cases of BCMA CAR T-cell–associated lymphomas. This discrepancy raises important questions that remain unresolved. There may be alternative hypotheses not addressed in this review. One possibility is the presence of circulating autoimmune intestinal disease-related T-cell clones. These clones can exist in individuals — akin to monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis — with or without intestinal inflammation or symptoms and may have predated CAR T-cell therapy, proliferating extensively due to CAR integration or indirect activation. Another hypothesis is the presence of a cross-reactive antigen on intestinal epithelial cells that interacts with the BCMA CAR structure, since we observed intestinal epithelial apoptosis and intraepithelial CAR T-cells in our patient biopsies similar to GVHD. Another possibility is secondary apoptosis of enterocytes by nearby activated T lymphocytes. While multiple hypotheses can be explored, we strongly believe that addressing this issue is crucial for developing targeted therapeutic strategies.

### Bioethical considerations of monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis: donor transfer after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation [^026d1bc2]. British Journal of Haematology (2007). Low credibility.

Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) is a recently described laboratory finding in otherwise healthy individuals. In MBL, a light chain-restricted, clonal B-cell population, often with a chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) phenotype, is identified by flow cytometry. Although the prognostic significance remains unclear, there is an increased incidence in ageing populations and those with a family history of CLL. During the past decade of MBL study, three families have come to our attention in which prospective sibling haematopoietic stem cell donors were found to have an MBL. These families raise complex bioethical issues with regard to disclosure of research data, eligibility for clinical trials and potential donor transfer of MBL. These issues are explored in this report. Identification of MBL among prospective sibling transplant donors will become a common occurrence in transplant practice as transplantation is increasingly offered to older individuals and those with CLL.

### The spectrum of disease manifestations in patients with common variable immunodeficiency disorders and partial antibody deficiency in a university hospital [^339326f0]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

It must be stressed that the age at which symptoms had started is not a reliable parameter in that it is a retrospective estimation and cannot be calculated in months and variation might even be 1 or 2 years.

Different classification schemes using clinical parameters, flow cytometric markers of B- and T cells have been proposed in order to subdivide the heterogeneous CVIDs population into more homogenous groups which might yield clues for possible pathogenic mechanisms as well lead to a model to predict which patients are prone to complications. Recently the first genome-wide association and gene copy number variation (CNV) study in patients with CVIDs was performed which uncovered multiple novel susceptibility loci for CVIDs confirming the polygenic nature. Nevertheless these results could provide new mechanistic insights into immunopathogenesis.

The EURO class trial established an association between a reduction in class switched memory B cells (< 2%) and CVIDs related complications was associated with a higher risk for splenomegaly and granulomatous disease. In other studies this association between a reduction of peripheral switched memory B cells and other clinical complications was confirmed. In our study, most patients had been diagnosed long before the bloodsampling. However, it is generally believed that the values in T and B cell phenotyping are more or less stable during the lifecycle of the patient. To our knowledge no data is published on this subject, it has only been confirmed by word of mouth during scientific sessions. The overall incidence of patients with a low percentage (< 2%) of class switched memory B cells was low. However, the association between autoimmune disease and a low percentage (< 2%) of class switched memory B cells was established as well as with splenomegaly and granulomatous disease. Furthermore patients with complications and > 2% of class switched memory B cells had lower median numbers of class switched memory B cells then patients without complications. Therefore, patients with complications were more affected in their number of class switched memory B cells than patients without any complicating disease. Also, patients with complications related to immune dysregulation had lower absolute numbers of CD19 positive B lymphocytes then those that did not described by Yong et al. Subsequently, we found a correlation between CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and specific complications as previous described in the literature. Few studies have investigated the correlation with clinical features. One study found that a low count of absolute naive CD4+ T cells was associated with splenomegaly and autoimmunity. It is likely that T cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of auto inflammatory conditions in CVIDs. According to some studies the T-cell dysregulation such as the decrease in naive CD4+ T cells in certain patients could be due to abnormal thymus function, however accelerate T cell turnover as a result of the high infectious burden may also be an explanation.

### Reassessment of small lymphocytic lymphoma in the era of monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis [^2e4ba00c]. Haematologica (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In the 2008 World Health Organization classification, small lymphocytic lymphoma is defined as a neoplasm with the tissue morphology and immunophenotype of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but with absence of leukemia. Minimal criteria of tissue involvement to separate small lymphocytic lymphoma from monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis have not been defined.

Design and Methods

We reviewed the clinicopathological features of 36 patients with extramedullary tissue biopsies containing chronic lymphocytic leukemia-type cells and less than 5 × 10⁹/L peripheral blood monoclonal B cells. Pathological features (extent and patterns of involvement, architectural preservation, presence of proliferation centers) as well as cytogenetic and radiological findings were examined in relation to clinical outcome.

Results

The biopsies were performed to evaluate lymphadenopathy in 20 patients and for other reasons (most frequently staging of a non-hematologic neoplasm) in 16 patients. At latest follow-up (median 23 months), 21 untreated patients had no or stable lymphadenopathy, 3 had regressed lymphadenopathy, and 12 had developed progressive lymphadenopathy and/or received therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. Features associated with progression/treatment included lymph nodes 1.5 cm or greater on imaging studies (P = 0.01) and presence of proliferation centers in the biopsied tissue (P = 0.004). Neither the size nor extent of involvement of the excised lymph node correlated with progression/treatment.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that biopsies containing chronic lymphocytic leukemia-type cells, but lacking proliferation centers and with non-enlarged or only slightly enlarged lymph nodes on imaging, represent a very indolent disease that may best be considered a tissue equivalent of monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis rather than overt small lymphocytic lymphoma. We propose that such cases be designated as tissue involvement by chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma-like cells of uncertain significance.

### FokI polymorphism of the vitamin D receptor gene: linking COVID-19 risk to genetic susceptibility in children [^1a717668]. Cytokine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitamin D receptor (VDR), influenced by gene polymorphisms like FokI, may affect susceptibility to infections, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since studies in children are limited, we aimed to analyze the correlation between the VDR FokI variant and both the incidence and severity of COVID-19 in Egyptian children.

Methods

Seventy-seven COVID-19-positive and 107 COVID-19-negative pediatric patients were included. Participants' serum 25(OH)D levels, inflammatory biomarkers, and demographics were evaluated. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for genotyping the VDR FokI (rs2228570) polymorphism.

Results

Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) was significantly lower in COVID-19 patients than in controls, while interleukin-6 (IL-6), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, and D-dimer were significantly higher (all p < 0.001). Vitamin D insufficiency was significantly more common in COVID-19 cases (18.2% versus 3.7%, p = 0.002). Male sex, increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and CRP were significantly associated with severe COVID-19 (p = 0.032, 0.029, < 0.001, respectively). The FokI TT genotype in codominant and recessive models and the T allele in the multiplicative model were significantly correlated with 2.4, 3.0, and 1.8 folds increased COVID-19 risk (p = 0.043, < 0.001, and 0.004, respectively). However, VDR FokI variants did not significantly associate with severe COVID-19.

Conclusion

The T allele and TT genotype of the FokI variant in the VDR gene increase susceptibility to COVID-19 but not its severity in Egyptian children. Additional research is required to validate the potential role of vitamin D and its receptor polymorphism in COVID-19.

### Pathology consultation on evaluating prognosis in incidental monoclonal lymphocytosis and chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^ede6a851]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a monoclonal B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder generally characterized by an indolent clinical course. However, some patients with CLL will have more aggressive disease progression, and identifying that subgroup may be important for early, or perhaps more aggressive, intervention. In addition, monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis is often found on routine laboratory evaluation, and it is important to distinguish this entity from overt CLL. Moreover, since many patients with CLL are discovered incidentally and before significant disease progression, prognostic laboratory evaluation may become increasingly efficacious as therapeutic options replace the older strategy of expectant observation. Prognostication may be especially critical if it correctly identifies patients with early stage CLL who are at high risk of clonal evolution and/ or resistance to chemoimmunotherapy. Laboratory studies include surface CD38 and intracellular ZAP-70 expression by flow cytometry, serum β2-microglobulin, and immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable gene mutational status. Cytogenetics for targeted chromosome alterations may similarly aid in predicting outcome and guiding early intervention. This article concisely reviews the utility of commonly performed prognostic markers and addresses the laboratory evaluation in patients with incidentally discovered early stage CLL.

### Clonal evolution is a prognostic factor for the clinical progression of monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis [^bf1eef01]. Blood Cancer Journal (2017). Low credibility.

To avoid a mixed cohort with low-count MBL, we excluded cases with fewer than 0.5 × 10⁹ clonal B cells/L. All subjects underwent a regular hematologic follow-up every 6–12 months (median number of follow-up visits: 5; range 2–16). The MBL phenotype was characterized at diagnosis by flow-cytometry and the same cytometric assessment was repeated in cases with evidence of disease progression. A detailed cytogenetic evaluation was performed by fluorescent in situ hybridization at presentation and repeated at least once for all individuals still at the MBL stage, no sooner than 18 months after initial testing (median interval to repetition: 26 months; range 18–48). Disease progression was based on B-cell cut-off limit of > 5 × 10⁹ cells/l (persisting for 3 months), and/or an increase in bone marrow infiltration rate > 20%, and/or the appearance of lymphadenopathy/organomegaly, detected either clinically or on ultrasound/computed tomography scans. Differences in time-to-event analysis were evaluated by log-rank statistics and multivariate analysis was performed by Cox proportional hazard regression. In case of continuous variables, the optimal cutoff points predicting the progression to overt disease were defined using the receiver–operator characteristic curves.

### Residual normal B-cell profiles in monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis versus chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^02ebe473]. Leukemia (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common adult leukemia in Western countries, which is characterized by the accumulation of mature CD5 + /CD20 lo /CD23 + clonal B-cells in peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM), and other lymphoid tissues. Currently, it is well-established that CLL is systematically preceded by a pre-leukemic stage, known as monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL); MBL includes both low-count (MBL lo) and high-count MBL (MBL hi), depending on the number of PB clonal B-cells (< 0.5 × 10⁹/L and ≥ 0.5 × 10⁹/L, respectively) detected, the former being a highly prevalent condition in adults (≈25% of individuals > 70 y). The biological and clinical significance of CLL-like clonal B-cells in PB of otherwise healthy individuals (MBL lo) has not been fully elucidated. Recently, we have reported a very low rate of transformation of MBL lo to MBL hi /CLL, after 7 years of follow-up. In contrast, we found a higher frequency of deaths in MBL lo subjects vs. age- and sex-matched non-MBL healthy adults from the same geographical area; among the former subjects, infection was an overrepresented cause of death (21% vs. 2%, respectively). This is in line with previous studies showing an ≈3-fold increased risk of infection in both MBL hi and CLL patients, in whom infections also represent a major cause of death.

Altogether, the above findings suggest an impaired immune system and immune surveillance, already at very early CLL stages. So far, several immunological defects of both the innate and adaptive compartments of the immune system have been reported in CLL, including hypogammaglobulinemia and an impaired T- and NK-cell function. However, the precise mechanisms that lead to this CLL-associated secondary immunodeficiency state still remain poorly understood, and little is known about the specific (pre-leukemic) stage of onset of the impaired immune response. Since hypogammaglobulinemia is one of the most common and relevant alterations involved in the secondary immunodeficiency of most CLL patients, here we investigated the composition of the residual normal PB B-cell compartment in both MBL lo and MBL hi vs. early (Rai stage 0) CLL, to gain insight into the mechanisms involved in hypogammaglobulinemia in CLL, and the precise stage at which the first alterations occur.

### Erythematous papular rash with sparing of folds [^7d76a70f]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

A 48-year-old Jamaican woman presented with several months of pruritus and a diffuse, erythematous scaly rash on the face, trunk, and extremities. At this time, there was no sparing of the folds. She was preemptively treated with triamcinolone 0.1% ointment and oral prednisone, 10 mg, for atopic dermatitis or contact dermatitis with minimal improvement. Laboratory values were significant for lymphocytosis and absolute eosinophilia. Biopsy found an atypical lymphoid infiltrate in the papillary dermis and epidermis (Fig 1). Nine months after initial presentation, the rash transformed into perifollicular red-brown papules that spared body folds and double-coverage areas (Fig 2, Fig 3, Fig 4). No palmoplantar hyperkeratosis or nail changes were noted. Repeat biopsy findings were again significant for an atypical lymphoid infiltrate in the papillary dermis and epidermis. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus-1 results were negative.

### The pathology of reactive lymphadenopathies: a discussion of common reactive patterns and their malignant mimics [^a24f2d23]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Context

-Distinguishing between a reactive and a neoplastic lymphoid proliferation is a clinically significant task frequently performed by the surgical pathologist in routine practice.

Objectives

-To highlight common situations in lymph node pathology where reactive changes and lymphoma may be misdiagnosed.

Data Sources

-Data sources are peer-reviewed journal articles, textbooks, and clinical experience.

Conclusions

-This review aims to refresh and enhance the surgical pathologist's awareness of the shared and distinguishing features of select reactive and neoplastic lymphoproliferations, which in turn will allow the surgical pathologist to make more accurate diagnoses and avoid the pitfalls of misdiagnosis. This will be done by describing a selection of commonly encountered reactive histologic changes observed in lymph nodes, present the lymphomas with which they share overlapping features, outline the features that distinguish them, and describe an approach to making an accurate diagnosis and avoiding a misdiagnosis in each scenario.

### High frequency of low-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis in hospitalized COVID-19 patients [^ad1ef827]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

In summary, here we report for the first time a higher frequency of MBL lo among COVID-19 patients referred to a tertiary hospital during the first year of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, compared to that observed in the general population from the same geographic area, particularly among hospitalized patients with more-severe disease. Based on our results and previous data from the literature, MBL lo emerges as a new independent risk marker for more-severe COVID-19, and therefore, it might represent a major public health concern, as subjects with an MBL lo -associated impaired immunity are more likely to suffer from other (eg, respiratory) severe infections and to develop inadequate responses to vaccination.

### Clinicoprognostic implications of increased serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblastic growth factor in early B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia [^2547a835]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Clinical studies and disease-progression evaluation

Serum levels of either VEGF or b-FGF were correlated with main clinical variables such as Rai clinical sub-stages, BM histology, absolute PB lymphocytosis, LDT, LDH and β2-m. Furthermore, VEGF and b-FGF were investigated as predictor of clinical outcome. To this purpose we used as end-point disease-progression (DP) defined as the appearance of the upper stages according to the Binet classification during the treatment-free period. As previously reported, DP has an important impact on overall survival of CLL patients in early disease stage. Therefore, DP can surrogate overall survival, thus shortening the duration of clinical studies in CLL.

Statistical methods

Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation and the corrected χ 2 test were applied to compare groups. Progression-free survival (PFS) curves were plotted according to the method of Kaplan–Meier and compared with the log-rank test. To evaluate the relative significance of some prognostic factors, the multiple regression model of Cox was applied. The set variables analyzed were as follows: stage according to Rai staging (0 vs I–II), LDT (< 12 vs > 12 months), absolute lymphocyte count (< 20 vs > 20×10⁹/l), LDH (< 425 vs 425 U l⁻¹), β-2 m (< 2.89 vs > 2.89 mg l⁻¹), sVEGF (< 203 vs > 203 ng mL⁻¹). The cut-off values of four continuous variables was determinated on the basis of median value of entire patient population.

### Occult B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders [^8f21bf58]. Histopathology (2011). Low credibility.

The term monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) was recently introduced to identify individuals with a population of monoclonal B cells in the absence of other features that are diagnostic of a B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. MBL is often identified through hospital investigation of a mild lymphocytosis, and approximately 1% of such individuals develop progressive disease requiring treatment per year. However, in population studies using high-sensitivity flow cytometry, MBL may be detectable in more than 10% of adults aged over 60 years, and clinical progression is rare. The majority of MBL cases have features that are characteristic of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, but an increasing amount of information is becoming available about MBL with the features of other B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. In addition to flow cytometry findings, the incidental detection of an occult B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder is also occurring in a significant proportion of tissue biopsy samples. In this review, the clinical and biological relationship between MBL and B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders will be discussed, with a focus on identifying the differences between low levels of peripheral blood or bone marrow involvement with lymphoma and the monoclonal B-cell populations that commonly occur in elderly adults.

### An unusual case of reactive lymphocytosis mimicking acute leukemia [^f0606ccd]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute leukemia is based on a combination of clinical, hematological, morphological, cytogenetic, and immunophenotypic data. The authors report a case of reactive lymphocytosis with extremely elevated lymphocytic and lymphoblastic leukocytosis that mimicked acute lymphoblastic leukemia, not only morphologically, but also in immunophenotypic analysis. They could not determine any underlying disease marker other than infectious symptoms that were present for 20 days prior to presentation to their clinic. Although this case presented with extremely high lymphocytic leukocytosis, the patient had normal blood cell lineage, a moderate level of blastic cells in bone marrow, and normal physical findings. These findings convinced the authors to follow up the patient before beginning treatment.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury [^810b50c6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) — hepatocellular or mixed injury evaluation includes excluding acute viral hepatitis (A, B, and C) and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) with standard serologies and HCV RNA testing (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Anti-HEV IgM testing may be considered in selected patients with heightened clinical suspicion, noting that performance of available commercial tests is not clear (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). We recommend testing for acute cytomegalovirus, acute Epstein–Barr virus, or acute herpes simplex virus infection if classical viral hepatitis has been excluded or if atypical lymphocytosis and lymphadenopathy suggest such causes (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence). We recommend evaluation for Wilson disease and Budd–Chiari syndrome when clinically appropriate (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).

Monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS) — treatment and response assessment state: For plasma cell-related MGRS, use the management algorithm for MM (MYEL-4). For lymphoplasmacytic-related MGRS, see NCCN Guidelines for Waldenström Macroglobulinemia/Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma. For any MGRS with monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) features, see NCCN Guidelines for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma. For IgG- or IgA-associated MGRS, use the Response Criteria for MM (MYEL-E); for IgM-associated MGRS, use the response criteria for WM (See NCCN Guidelines for Waldenström Macroglobulinemia/Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma); and for FLC-associated MGRS, use the response criteria for amyloidosis (See NCCN Guidelines for Systemic Light Chain Amyloidosis). For cases in which the causal monoclonal paraprotein is not detectable or is difficult to measure, evaluate renal function and evaluate bone marrow involvement or radiologic findings. Individualize treatment based on response and toxicity of prior therapy, patient's performance status, and renal function at the time of relapse. Systemic agents associated with neurotoxicity should be used with caution. Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Low-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis persists after seven years of follow up and is associated with a poorer outcome [^78e5c08b]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Follow-up of the MBL lo cohort

From those 91 MBL lo individuals identified in the screening study performed in the general population of Salamanca between 2007 and 2009, 65–71% of MBL lo cases from the original series; 29 males and 36 females; median age at baseline 70 (range: 43–84 years old)-; were re-evaluated after a median follow-up of seven years (range: 61 to 95 months) (Table 1). These 65 individuals were representative of the original MBL lo cohort for all variables analyzed, except for a significantly lower age (P = 0.02) vs. those 26 individuals that could not be followed - median age of 75 (range: 48–95 years)-. These later subjects could only be re-evaluated for their death vs. alive status at the end of the study because of: i) 12/26 (46%) died before the fifth year of follow-up; ii) 2 subjects declined continuing their participation in the study; and iii) the remaining 12 cases were lost to follow-up after > 5y from recruitment. Eight of 65 cases followed for > 5y (12%) died afterward, making a total of 21 (26%) deaths among MBL lo cases included in OS analyses.

### Infrequent "chronic lymphocytic leukemia-specific" immunoglobulin stereotypes in aged individuals with or without low-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis [^31eeadff]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a chronic, incurable malignancy of antigen-experienced B cells, mainly affecting the aged population. Immunogenetic analysis in CLL revealed the existence of subsets of patients expressing stereotyped B-cell receptor immunoglobulins (BcR IG), which represent homogeneous CLL variants with distinct biological and clinical characteristics. Little is known regarding the presence of "CLL-specific", stereotyped BcR IG within the repertoire of healthy individuals. Low-throughput studiesled to the identification of cases with stereotyped BcR IG, followed by next-generation sequencing studies that found CLL stereotypes in normal B-cell populations, albeit at very low frequencies.

This issue is more pertinent to monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL), characterized by clonal "CLL-like" B-cell expansions detected in 3–12% of the population".CLL-like" MBL is categorized into high-count (HC-MBL) and low-count (LC-MBL) forms, based on a cutoff of 0.5 × 10⁹ cells/L. Previously, we showed that HC-MBL was immunogenetically similar to CLL, whereas LC-MBL was characterized by low frequency and different characteristics of stereotyped BcR IG. However, this evidence derived from low-throughput data and was, thus, inherently limited with regards to reflecting the complexity of the BcR IG repertoire.

### The biological and clinical relationship between CD5 + 23 + monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia [^1ac02664]. British Journal of Haematology (2007). Low credibility.

A CD5(+)23(+) monoclonal B-cell population is detectable in approximately 3% of the general adult population. The phenotype of the monoclonal CD5(+)23(+) B cells is identical to chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) with respect to a large number of proteins in addition to the standard diagnostic markers used to identify CLL. Studies in CLL families and direct assessment of genetic features indicate a close biological association between indolent CLL and the CLL-phenotype cells detected in individuals with a normal blood count. Patients with a CLL-phenotype monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) often have increasing CLL cell counts with time and some progress to a stage requiring treatment. Analysis of intraclonal variation in the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene suggests a process of clonal diversification rather than clonal selection in the early stages of disease progression. CLL-phenotype MBL is detectable in approximately 10% of cases referred for investigation of a lymphocytosis and future studies should be directed towards the detection of factors which identify MBL patients at risk of disease progression.

Methods

Subjects and samples

The baseline study was conducted from December 2007 to October 2009, when PB samples from 639 healthy adult (≥ 40y) volunteers (54% females/46% males) from the general population of the same geographical area (Salamanca, Northwest of Spain) were screened for the presence of small B-cell clones, using highly sensitive FCM. At inclusion, all subjects had normal PB cell counts and did not suffer from any hematological/immunological disease, as described elsewhere. In 91/639 subjects studied (14.2%), ≥ 1 PB clonal B-cell population was detected at recruitment; in the vast majority of them (80/91; 88%) clonal B cells were consistent with CLL-like MBL lo (< 0.5×10⁹ clonal B cells/L showing a CLL-like phenotype), whereas the remaining 11 individuals (12%) were classified as non CLL-like MBL lo. MBL lo subjects were re-evaluated at a median time of seven years after recruitment (range: 61 to 95 months). All subjects gave their written informed consent at baseline for both the initial and the follow-up studies, and they filled out an epidemiological questionnaire with demographic and (self-reported) medical information, under the supervision of his/her primary care doctor. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Salamanca (Spain).

Flow cytometry immunophenotypic studies

Overall, 1–4 mL of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)-anticoagulated PB was collected per case and follow-up time-point; subsequently it was processed and analyzed using previously reported highly sensitive FCM approaches, (Online Supplementary Methods and Online Supplementary Table S1).
