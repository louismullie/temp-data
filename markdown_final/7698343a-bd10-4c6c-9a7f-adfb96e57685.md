## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about determining the most likely diagnosis for a 24-year-old man with intermittent shortness of breath that worsens at night, a history of similar childhood symptoms, a history of skin disease, tachypnea, and rhonchi on exam. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how the age and temporal pattern of symptoms influence pretest probabilities. Then, I should verify which physical findings truly support each competing diagnosis. Next, I will examine how the childhood history and skin disease shape the differential. After that, I need to compare each option against guideline-based discriminators and the provided clinical clues. Finally, I will synthesize the most likely diagnosis and briefly consider next steps for confirmation and rule-outs, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the key clinical features and their implications. The patient is 24 years old, which makes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) highly unlikely in the absence of significant smoking or other risk factors, whereas asthma is common in young adults and often begins in childhood, frequently with nocturnal worsening and variable symptoms, which fits the history of intermittent shortness of breath worse at night and a similar childhood pattern [^115ppn5R] [^117MgdF1].

> Wait, let me verify the significance of the skin disease history. Atopy, including eczema or allergic dermatitis, is a recognized risk factor and supportive feature for asthma, and GINA explicitly notes that allergy, rhinitis, and/or eczema often accompany asthma, which strengthens the case for asthma here given the confluence of nocturnal symptoms, young age, and atopic history [^117MgdF1].

> I will now examine the physical findings. Rhonchi on auscultation are compatible with airway obstruction and wheeze, which are classic for asthma. Tachypnea reflects increased work of breathing during an exacerbation or symptomatic period. Hold on, I should verify that rhonchi are not more specific to another entity — rhonchi are nonspecific but commonly heard in asthma, whereas COPD typically shows wheezes and chest tightness and is uncommon at this age without risk factors, and pulmonary fibrosis usually presents with fine bibasilar crackles rather than rhonchi, which helps differentiate here [^115ppn5R] [^117MgdF1].

> Next, I should review the competing diagnoses systematically. COPD is improbable at 24 years old without smoking or occupational exposures, and GOLD emphasizes midlife onset and progressive symptoms with risk factor exposure, which are not present here; moreover, GOLD's differential highlights that asthma tends to have early onset, variable symptoms, and nocturnal worsening, which matches this case far better than COPD [^117MgdF1]. Pulmonary fibrosis typically causes progressive exertional dyspnea with a restrictive pattern and bibasilar crackles, not intermittent nocturnal symptoms with rhonchi, making it less likely in this presentation [^notfound]. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) can mimic asthma but usually requires a history of bronchiectasis, recurrent infiltrates, and often peripheral eosinophilia; there is no such history provided here, so ABPA remains possible but less likely than straightforward asthma on first principles [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should double-check that no red flags point away from asthma. There is no mention of hemoptysis, weight loss, clubbing, digital clubbing, or fixed airflow obstruction, which would push me toward bronchiectasis, interstitial lung disease, or other pathology; the absence of these features and the presence of intermittent, nocturnal symptoms with atopy and rhonchi keep asthma as the leading diagnosis [^115ppn5R] [^115LeAdp].

> Let me synthesize. The combination of young age, intermittent shortness of breath worse at night, a similar childhood history, atopic skin disease, and exam findings of tachypnea with rhonchi is most consistent with bronchial asthma. I should confirm that this aligns with guideline-based diagnostic features: GINA describes variable respiratory symptoms often worse at night or on waking, frequently triggered by allergens or viral infections, and commonly associated with atopy, all of which fit this case; the presence of rhonchi supports airflow limitation during symptoms, and the childhood history reinforces a long-standing asthma phenotype rather than a new-onset alternative diagnosis [^115ppn5R].

> But wait, what if this is early ABPA or another eosinophilic lung disease? I need to ensure I do not overcall asthma without considering eosinophilic mimics. Marked eosinophilia or steroid-refractory symptoms would prompt evaluation for eosinophilic pneumonia or ABPA; however, in the absence of reported peripheral eosinophilia, bronchiectasis, or recurrent infiltrates, asthma remains the most parsimonious explanation here, with ABPA as a consideration if symptoms are refractory or eosinophilia emerges [^111Hz7tY].

> Final answer: b) Bronchial asthma. The clinical picture is best explained by asthma given the patient's age, intermittent nocturnal symptoms, childhood history, atopic skin disease, and rhonchi on exam, with COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, and ABPA being less likely based on age, risk factors, and classic phenotypic features [^115ppn5R] [^117MgdF1].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **bronchial asthma** [^115ppn5R], given the patient's young age, intermittent nocturnal dyspnea, childhood history, and atopic skin disease, with rhonchi on exam supporting reversible airway obstruction [^notfound]. COPD is unlikely at 24 without smoking or occupational exposures [^117YL4cT], and pulmonary fibrosis typically presents with progressive exertional dyspnea and crackles, not intermittent nocturnal symptoms [^notfound]. ABPA is less likely without bronchiectasis or eosinophilia [^notfound]. Confirm with spirometry showing reversible airflow obstruction and assess atopy with skin testing or IgE [^116Zi2NB].

## Differential diagnosis

| **Diagnosis** | **Rationale for inclusion** | **Rationale for exclusion** |
|-|-|-|
| Bronchial asthma | - Young age <br/> - Intermittent symptoms <br/> - Nocturnal worsening <br/> - Childhood history <br/> - Atopic skin disease <br/> - Rhonchi on exam [^notfound] | None significant |
| Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) | - Shortness of breath <br/> - Wheezing/rhonchi [^111ofsmf] | - Rare at 24 <br/> - No smoking or occupational exposures <br/> - Symptoms are progressive, not intermittent |
| Pulmonary fibrosis | - Shortness of breath | - Rare at 24 <br/> - Progressive course <br/> - Crackles on exam <br/> - Not intermittent |
| Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) | - Asthma-like symptoms <br/> - Atopy | - No bronchiectasis <br/> - No eosinophilia <br/> - No fungal features |

## Clinical features supporting bronchial asthma

- **Age and symptom pattern**: Young age, intermittent symptoms, and nocturnal worsening are classic for asthma [^117MgdF1].
- **Childhood history**: Recurrent symptoms since childhood support asthma [^117MgdF1].
- **Atopic skin disease**: Strongly associated with asthma [^117MgdF1].
- **Physical examination**: Rhonchi indicate reversible airway obstruction [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic approach

- **Spirometry**: Confirm reversible airflow obstruction (FEV₁ increase ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL after bronchodilator) [^notfound].
- **Peak flow monitoring**: Document variability consistent with asthma [^115ppn5R].
- **Allergy testing**: Skin prick tests or specific IgE to identify allergens [^notfound].
- **Chest radiography**: Not routine; consider if alternative diagnosis suspected [^117QxUGx].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most likely diagnosis is **bronchial asthma**, supported by age, intermittent nocturnal symptoms, childhood history, atopic skin disease, and rhonchi. Confirm with spirometry and allergy testing, and initiate guideline-based asthma management [^115ppn5R].

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^117MgdF1]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — suggestive features distinguishing COPD from common mimics are listed as follows. COPD presents with symptoms slowly progressive and a history of tobacco smoking or other risk factors. Asthma shows variable airflow obstruction with symptoms that vary widely from day to day, symptoms worse at night/early morning, allergy, rhinitis, and/or eczema also present, often occurs in children, and family history of asthma. Congestive heart failure is suggested by chest X-ray showing a dilated heart and pulmonary edema, and pulmonary function tests indicating volume restriction, not airflow obstruction. Bronchiectasis features large volumes of purulent sputum, is commonly associated with bacterial infection, and chest X-ray/HRCT shows bronchial dilation. Tuberculosis can have onset at all ages, chest X-ray shows lung infiltrate, microbiological confirmation, and high local prevalence of tuberculosis. Obliterative bronchiolitis can occur in children, is seen after lung or bone marrow transplantation, and HRCT on expiration shows hypodense areas. Diffuse panbronchiolitis is predominantly seen in patients of Asian descent; most patients are male and nonsmokers; almost all have chronic sinusitis; and chest X-ray & HRCT show diffuse small centrilobular nodular opacities & hyperinflation. These features are characteristic but not mandatory; for example, a person who has never smoked may develop COPD, especially in LMICs where other risk factors may be more important than cigarette smoking.

### A 24-year-old man with dyspnea and a broken left femur [^116JG592]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 24-year-old White man presented with 1-day complaints of progressive shortness of breath and fever. He recently underwent an open reduction and internal fixation of a left midshaft femur fracture from a skiing accident 4 days ago. He denied chest pain, skin rashes, hemoptysis, hematemesis, melena, or surgical site bleeding. On arrival, the patient appeared in mild respiratory distress with a respiratory rate of 23 breaths/min, temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 97 beats/min, BP of 95/54 mm Hg, and peripheral saturation of 97% on 6-L/min nasal canula. His initial peripheral saturation on room air was 67%. Physical examination was unremarkable, except for diffuse rhonchi on chest auscultation. Chest radiograph on admission showed alveolar opacities predominantly in bilateral lower lobes. A chest CT angiography revealed no evidence for pulmonary embolism. However, there were findings of diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities with areas of patchy consolidation and innumerous micronodules in both lungs (Fig 1). Laboratory examination was significant for a drop of hemoglobin by 3 g/dL and hematocrit level by 7% since his hospital discharge 4 days earlier. His renal function and urine analysis were normal. Venous blood gas on admission showed pH of 7.39 and Pco₂ of 43 mm Hg. Because of unexplained acute anemia, nonspecific CT chest findings and progressive dyspnea, a bronchoscopy with BAL was performed. Four aliquots of 60 mL saline solution were injected for lavage with fluid return (Fig 2). BAL fluid showed WBC count of 0.411 × 10³/mm³, RBC count of 318 × 10³/mm³, 100% fresh RBCs, 73% neutrophil, 24% lymphocytes, 1% monocytes, and 2% eosinophils. BAL fluid cytologic condition is shown in Figure 3. A full vasculitis workup by rheumatology was unremarkable. Ophthalmologic and skin examination were unrevealing.

2 CASE PRESENTATION

A 15‐year‐old male patient presented to our clinic with fatigue and shortness of breath for 2 years. He had a 5 kg weight loss over the last 3 months, dry cough, and tachypnea, which increased with effort and continued at rest. The patient had two hospitalizations for pneumonia at the ages of 4 and 8 years, which did not require respiratory support. The parents were not consanguineous, and he had no known family history of chronic respiratory disease or other conditions (Podcast).

On physical examination, the patient's growth parameters were normal. Although there was no fever, he had tachypnea (respiratory rate: 42/min) and dyspnea with jugular retractions at rest. His peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO₂) was 91% in room air (RA). Pectus excavatum and clubbing of the fingers and toes were present. No abnormal breath sounds were heard on auscultation.

Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) were found to be abnormal (expressed as % predicted). The spirometry test revealed the following results: forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV₁) 45%, forced vital capacity (FVC) 48%, FEV₁ /FVC 94%, and carbon monoxide diffusion capacity (DL CO): 53%. The body plethysmography test results were as follows: total lung capacity (TLC) 66%, residual volume (RV) 94%, RV/TLC 42,4. In the 6‐min walk test (6‐MWT), his SpO₂ was found to be 84%, intermittent coughing started, dyspnea increased, and the test was discontinued at a distance of 400 m. His arterial blood gas test at rest showed borderline hypercapnia and hypoxemia (pCO₂: 48.6 mmHg, pO₂: 66.9 mmHg). The partial alveolar‐arterial pressure gradient (P (A‐a)) was found to be increased to 80 mmHg (normal < 15 mmHg). The serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was found to be 328 U/L (elevated).

2.1 Challenge point

A 15‐year‐old male with a 3‐month history of tachypnea, fatigue, and weight loss presented to the pediatric pulmonology clinic. Pectus excavatum, clubbing, restrictive pattern in spirometry, decreased DL CO, increased P (A‐a), and elevated LDH were detected.

Case presentation

A 69-year-old man presented with intermittent dyspnea, cough, and sputum production for more than a year, and he experienced symptom exacerbation for the last two months. Despite the intermittent use of traditional Chinese medicine (unclear), there was no significant improvement. Two months before presentation, the patient's dyspnea worsened, and chest computed tomography (CT) identified a bronchial mass. He self-administered antibiotics, but his symptoms persisted. Additionally, he reported poor appetite, sleep disturbance, and the loss of approximately 10 kg in weight over the past year. His medical history included coronary artery disease for 5 years and thyroidectomy for benign thyroid nodules 5 years ago before presentation. He denied any history of smoking or alcohol consumption. He was currently on regular levothyroxine therapy (50 µg/day).

On admission, the patient was lethargic with cyanotic lips and tachypnea. His vital signs were as follows: temperature, 36.5 °C; heart rate, 98 beats/min; respiratory rate, 24 breaths/min; and blood pressure, 142/81 mmHg. Physical examination revealed bilateral coarse breath sounds with inspiratory crackles and minimal moist rales in the left lower lung. Cardiac and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. The results of laboratory tests, including a complete blood count, coagulation profile, liver and renal function tests, thyroid function tests (TSH, 2.263 mIU/L; T4, 93.33 nmol/L; FT3, 15.90 pmol/L; T3, 1.37 nmol/L; FT3, 4.6 pmol/L), and assessments of markers for autoimmune and infectious conditions, were normal excluding a low blood potassium level of 2.82 mmol/L. Arterial blood gas analysis (with nasal oxygen at 4 L/min) revealed the following findings: pH, 7.46; PCO₂, 60 mmHg; PO₂, 65 mmHg; lactate, 0.8 mmol/L; HCO₃⁻, 42.7 mmol/L; base excess, 15.8 mmol/L; and oxygen saturation, 94%. Enhanced chest CT (Fig. 1) revealed an approximately 18-mm nodular soft tissue mass in the trachea with a density of 82 Hounsfield units. The mass exhibited heterogeneous enhancement and caused significant luminal narrowing, and it featured indistinct borders from the surrounding cartilage and the left thyroid lobe, raising concerns of malignancy.

### Recognition of tuberous sclerosis in adult women: delayed presentation with life-threatening consequences [^115UUzfU]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is associated with tumor development in the brain, retina, kidney, skin, heart, and lung. Seizures, intellectual disability, and characteristic skin lesions commonly manifest in early childhood, but some findings, notably renal angiomyolipomas and pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), emerge later, placing adults with undiagnosed TSC at increased risk for morbidity and mortality.

Objective

To describe the clinical presentation and severity of TSC in adult women.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, 1995 to 2010.

Patients

79 women aged 18 years or older who were enrolled in an observational cohort study of TSC to evaluate disease manifestations.

Measurements

History, physical examination, pulmonary function testing, chest radiography, abdominal computed tomography, high-resolution chest computed tomography, and brain magnetic resonance imaging were used to evaluate patients.

Results

Among the 45 patients who received a diagnosis of TSC in adulthood, 21 presented with symptoms due to LAM, 19 with renal angiomyolipomas, and 10 with seizures. Of the 45 patients, 30 met clinical criteria for TSC in childhood that remained undiagnosed for a median of 21.5 years and 15 were older than 18 years before meeting the clinical criteria for TSC. Patients diagnosed in adulthood and those diagnosed in childhood had similar occurrences of pneumothorax, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, nephrectomy, and death.

Limitation

No men were included in the study, and selection was biased toward patients having pulmonary LAM.

Conclusion

Women who received a TSC diagnosis in adulthood had minimal morbidity during childhood but were still at risk for life-threatening pulmonary and renal manifestations.

His pulmonary workup included a chest computed tomography scan, which demonstrated emphysematous changes in both lung apices; diffuse thickening of air bronchi, and atelectasis of segments in the right middle and lower lobes. Spirometry revealed an obstructive disorder with a forced expiratory volume (FEV₁) to forced volume capacity (FVC) ratio of 0.75. An increase in FEV₁ by 14% following salbutamol treatment confirmed the diagnosis of mild asthma.

Overall, P1's complex medical history underscores the need for a thorough evaluation and targeted management of significant immunological and developmental challenges.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^117QxUGx]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Objective assessments — arterial blood gases and chest X-ray: Arterial blood gas measurements are not routinely required; they should be considered for patients with PEF or FEV₁ < 50% predicted or for those who do not respond to initial treatment or are deteriorating, and supplemental controlled oxygen should be continued while blood gases are obtained. During an asthma exacerbation PaCO₂ is often below normal (< 40 mmHg); PaO₂ < 60 mmHg (8 kPa) and normal or increased PaCO₂ (especially > 45 mmHg, 6 kPa) indicate respiratory failure. Chest X-ray is not routinely recommended; in adults it should be considered if a complicating or alternative cardiopulmonary process is suspected (especially in older patients) or for patients not responding to treatment where a pneumothorax may be difficult to diagnose clinically, and in children routine check X-ray is not recommended unless there are physical signs suggestive of pneumothorax, parenchymal disease or an inhaled foreign body; features associated with positive chest X-ray findings in children include fever, no family history of asthma, and localized lung examination findings.

Case Presentation

A 57-year-old man presented to the ED with a 1-month history of nonproductive cough and shortness of breath. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 months before presentation, when he experienced an episode of nonproductive cough and shortness of breath. He was diagnosed clinically with an upper respiratory tract infection; the symptoms resolved after 7 days with conservative therapy alone. One month later, the nonproductive cough and shortness of breath returned. He was treated with a 5-day course of oral azithromycin without any improvement in his symptoms. On presentation to the ED, he denied fever, chills, night sweats, chest pain, arthralgia, myalgia, or hemoptysis. His medical history was significant for hypertension, poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery bypass grafting. His medications included aspirin, metoprolol, metformin, and glipizide. He denied any history of tobacco, vaping, or recreational drug use. He worked as a cashier in a departmental store and has been doing so for most of his life.

### From dyspnea to diagnosis: a pediatric case report on an unexpected condition [^115UnyjY]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Case Presentation

A 7‐year‐old Caucasian patient arrived at the pediatric emergency room with symptoms of acute dyspnea. His parents reported that he had been quite well the previous day and that during the night he had suddenly woken up with shortness of breath. Apart from abnormal growth at the third percentile, this was a healthy patient with no significant past medical history. The patient was born to a primigravida mother at 38 weeks of gestation, with normal postnatal adaptation and up‐to‐date vaccinations (Figure 1a). On arrival, he was febrile (38.1°C) tachypneic (60 breaths/min), and dyspneic, with a dry cough and marked tachycardia (144 beats/min). The peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO₂) was 83% on room air without apparent cyanosis. The physical examination revealed a shallow breathing pattern, and prolonged active expiration with apparent retractions of subcostal and jugular regions. On auscultation, there were both expiratory wheezing and rhonchi. An intensive bronchodilation therapy with short‐acting β agonist (SABA) was started and the patient was admitted to the inpatient department where, on oxygen therapy (3 L/min via a face mask) his SpO₂ normalized. The physician then ordered a C‐reactive protein (CRP), full blood count (CBC), chest radiograph, and an antigen panel for common respiratory viruses. The CRP was elevated (77.8 mg/L, reference range: 0–5 mg/L), and the CBC showed marked leukocytosis with neutrophil predominance (33.0 × 10⁹/L, reference range: 4.5–14.5 × 10⁹/L). The chest radiograph (Figure 1b) revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, while the left middle and left lower fields showed a marked increase in opacity. After obtaining nasal swabs, oral swabs, and sputum samples for microbiology cultures, antibiotic treatment was administered with ampicillin 300 mg/kg/day divided into three doses, repeated bronchodilation therapy (salbutamol, 100 µg/dose) and intravenous methylprednisolone for 5 days (1.1 mg/kg/day).

### A case of plateau heart disease misdiagnosed as chronic pulmonary heart disease [^113SWv2j]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis and differential diagnosis

Diagnosis

Plateau heart disease

Plateau pulmonary hypertension

Cardiac function class II

Type I Respiratory Failure

Hyperuricemia

Hypertension

Diagnostic principles: The patient is a middle-aged man and has a chronic course of the disease. The condition is recurrent with main symptoms of chest tightness and shortness of breath that become worse after activity. Cardiac ultrasound suggests moderate pulmonary hypertension. Chest CT suggests no apparent emphysema. Pulmonary angiography also suggests no abnormalities. Therefore, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchial asthma, pulmonary embolism and sleep apnoea hypoventilation syndrome could be excluded. High altitude related hypertension is confirmed because the patient has worked at high altitude (3000 m) for 10 years and lived at middle and high altitude (2500 m) for a long time.

Differential diagnosis

Plateau heart disease should be differentiated from plateau chronic pulmonary heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, and plateau congenital heart disease.

Treatment

Oxygen therapy (low-flow oxygen,2 l/min) and intermittent diuresis (spironolactone 20 m/day and furosemide 20 mg/day) were prescribed to reduce cardiac afterload, and alisentan (5 mg/day) was prescribed to reduce pulmonary arterial pressure after admission.

Treatment outcomes and follow-up

After treatment, the symptoms of chest tightness and shortness of breath were relieved. The patient was advised to take oral diuretics intermittently for a long period and oral anolisentan regularly, and followed up to monitor heart, liver and kidney function and blood pressure.

Acute cough algorithm — adult initial management, red flags, and follow-up: The figure applies to "patients ≥ 15 years of age with cough lasting ≤ 3 weeks" and instructs to "Always screen for the presence of red flags as a clue to a potentially life-threatening condition". Listed life-threatening causes include "Pneumonia, severe exacerbation of asthma or COPD, PE, heart failure, other serious disease". It also advises to "Always consider the presence of TB in endemic areas or high-risk populations even if chest radiographs are normal" and to "Remember to routinely assess cough severity or quality of life before and after treatment and routinely follow patients 4–6 weeks after initial visit". Red flags include "Hemoptysis", "Smoker > 45 years of age with a new cough, change in cough, or coexisting voice disturbance", "Adults aged 55–80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or who have quit within the past 15 years", "Prominent dyspnea, especially at rest or at night", "Hoarseness", "Systemic symptoms" (with "Fever", "Weight loss", "Peripheral edema with weight gain"), "Trouble swallowing when eating or drinking", "Vomiting", "Recurrent pneumonia", and "Abnormal respiratory exam and/or abnormal chest radiograph coinciding with duration of cough".

Case Presentation

A 56-year-old man with a history of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), in addition to recurrent bronchitis and pneumonia, presented with progressively worsening shortness of breath over a period of a few months. He was able to conduct his activities of daily living at baseline; however, his condition declined over a period of months to the point of shortness of breath with climbing a flight of stairs. The patient also developed a frequent dry cough and wheezing. He denied fever, chest pain, weight loss, and hemoptysis. He had been diagnosed with CVID in 1968, at 7 years of age, after recurrent episodes of bronchitis and pneumonia, and was treated with IV immunoglobulin monthly for decades. The patient was a lifelong nonsmoker and had no significant environmental or occupational exposures. He was referred to our hospital for further management.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113dD3d4]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Classification and evaluation of pediatric cough — at first presentation, specific cough overlaps with non-specific cough and the latter overlaps with 'expected cough'. 'Expected cough' refers to coughing illness reflective of common upper respiratory viral infections in an otherwise child where the cough duration is usually < 2 weeks but may be longer in a small minority. Children with a chronic cough should be reevaluated until a diagnosis is found with resolution of the cough (if possible). The presence of any specific cough pointer indicates an etiology of chronic cough and when any of these symptoms and signs are present, the cough is referred to as 'specific cough'. In some children, the quality of cough is recognizable and suggestive of specific etiology. Non-specific cough is more likely to resolve without specific treatment and it is characterized by a dry/nonproductive cough in the absence of specific cough pointers with normal CXR and spirometry. Contributing exacerbating factors such as tobacco smoke exposure and parental expectations should also be evaluated, irrespective of the underlying etiology.

### A 31-year-old man with fever, atypical chest pain, and mediastinal mass [^116MGLfr]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 31-year-old Asian male never-smoker living in the upper Midwest with a past medical history of congenital bilateral hearing loss sought treatment with a 1-week history of fever, fatigue, right-sided pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, productive cough with mild intermittent hemoptysis, night sweats, and unintentional 10-lb weight loss over 4 weeks. He was adopted from South Korea as an infant, and thus the family history was unknown. He worked in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning business, performing installations and repairs. There was no known exposure to animals, caves, rivers, lakes, or wooded areas. He travelled to South Korea and New Hampshire approximately 9 months previously. He did not take any medication.

### A 14-year-old female with chest mass, shortness of breath, and hypertension [^11319p8h]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

A previously healthy 14-year-old girl was evaluated in the emergency department (ED) with 2 months of shortness of breath and fatigue.

Methods

She initially presented to her primary pediatrician, where a complete blood count was only significant for mild anemia, thyroid function tests were normal, and a chest x-ray revealed a chest mass. This prompted her primary pediatrician to order a computed tomography scan and refer to the ED.

Results

Her computed tomography scan confirmed a mediastinal mass versus necrotic lymphadenopathy. Her initial physical exam was unremarkable, except for hypertension. From the ED, she was admitted to the pediatric hospital medicine service. Infectious disease, oncology, and nephrology services were consulted to guide diagnostic evaluation.

Conclusions

Eventually, during her hospitalization, further history and workup led to a definitive diagnosis.

PRESENTING FEATURES: An 18-year-old white man was admitted to the Osler Medical Service with the chief complaint of back pain. Two weeks prior to admission, the patient developed diffuse and aching upper back pain. Over the next couple of days, he also developed severe anterior chest pain that was somewhat pleuritic in nature but diffuse and extending bilaterally into the shoulders. One week prior to admission, he developed intermittent fevers and night sweats. The patient denied any lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, sick contacts, shortness of breath, rash, or bleeding. He was seen by a physician and told that he had thrombocytopenia. There was no history of recent or remote unusual bleeding episodes. His medical history was unremarkable except for a childhood diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. He was not taking any medications and had no history of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use. He had no risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus infection. Physical examination showed that he was afebrile and had normal vital signs. He was a well-appearing man who was lying still because of pain. HEENT examination was unremarkable. There was no pharyngeal erythema or exudates. His lungs were clear. His neck was supple and without lymphadenopathy. Examination of his back and chest revealed no focal tenderness. There was no hepatosplenomegaly, and his skin was without petechiae or rashes. Examination of the patient's joints showed pain on passive and active movement of his shoulders bilaterally, but no frank arthritis. There was no rash, petechiae, or echymoses. Chest radiograph and electrocardiogram were unremarkable. On admission, the laboratory examination was notable for a hematocrit level of 32.5%, with a mean corpuscular volume of 79 fL, and white blood cell count of 2.8 x 10(3)/microL. Platelet count was 75 x 10(3)/microL. A white blood cell differential revealed 7% bands, 53% polys, 34% lymphs, 5% atypical lymphocytes, 2% nucleated red cells, and a few young unidentified cells. His chemistry studies were unremarkable. What is the diagnosis?

### Asthmatic adult with marked blood eosinophilia: is it truly asthma? [^111Hz7tY]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Peripheral blood eosinophilia is frequently encountered in the general medical and respiratory clinics. Asthma is often associated with peripheral eosinophilia, however, marked levels of eosinophilia are uncommon and should warrant further investigation. The patient described in this article presented with an initial diagnosis of allergic asthma but failed to respond to inhaled corticosteroids. Marked blood eosinophilia prompted the investigation for other eosinophilic lung diseases, which eventually yielded a diagnosis of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP). This article illustrates the importance of a high index of suspicion for eosinophilic lung diseases should patients previously diagnosed as allergic asthma fail to respond to therapy, especially if this was associated with marked blood eosinophilia.

### Familial dilated cardiomyopathy in a child: a case report [^116xZXyJ]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 2-year-old girl, with a family history of early-onset cardiomyopathy (Fig. 1) and a medical history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections necessitating only symptomatic care, visited her primary care pediatrician with symptoms of increasing lethargy, cough, shortness of breath after minimal exercise (such as walking, eating, and crying), puffy eyes, and edema in the lower extremities. Subsequently, she was referred to a pediatric cardiologist, who conducted an echocardiogram and baseline laboratory tests in a private clinic setting. The initial assessment revealed heart failure with a 30% ejection fraction. Following this diagnosis, the patient received outpatient treatment consisting of oral medications (Furosemide, Captopril, Spironolactone, Digoxin, and Carvedilol) and underwent frequent follow-up visits.

Fig. 1
Pedigree of familial dilated cardiomyopathy. Our patient is indicated in the figure above

During the 7-month period following the initial diagnosis, the patient's condition remained stable with no significant improvement or deterioration until one week prior to her presentation at our Emergency Department of the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC). At that time, she experienced frequent vomiting, worsening lethargy, and increased shortness of breath leading to a state of cardiogenic shock.

On presentation, she was ill-looking with mottled skin, cyanotic lips, cold extremities, weak peripheral pulses and delayed capillary refill time. She was afebrile, tachypneic, tachycardic, and hypotensive (respiratory rate (RR) of 60 breaths/minute, heart rate (HR) of 166 beats/minute, blood pressure (BP) of 78/31 mmHg and percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO₂) of 100% on face mask oxygen 5 liters/minute). Auscultation revealed faint heart sounds and diffuse rhonchi over the chest. Mild hepatomegaly was also noted.

### Elevated pulmonary pressure noted on echocardiogram: a simplified approach to next steps [^112fKyvo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Case 2: A 42‐year‐old woman with a 20 pack‐year history of smoking presents to the clinic with an episode of syncope in the setting of progressively worsening shortness of breath over the last few months and symptoms consistent with Raynaud disease. Electrocardiogram and chest radiograph are unremarkable. Echocardiogram shows normal left ventricular size and function, severely dilated right ventricle, severe right ventricular dysfunction with a TAPSE of 11 mm, small pericardial effusion, and an estimated PASP of 60 mm Hg.

The similarities between this case and case 1 end with the significantly elevated PASP on echocardiography. The young age of this patient alone would make PH‐LHD unlikely. However, she does have risk factors (smoking) that would prompt consideration for chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD). It is important to remember that the prevalence of PH in COPD is dependent on the severity of disease and requires quantification. Patients with a history of smoking (or oxygen dependency) often get labeled with COPD without formal evaluation with pulmonary function testing. Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage 1–3 do not usually cause significant PH. In fact, 90% of patients with GOLD stage 4 COPD have mean PAP > 20 mm Hg, most ranging between 20 and 35 mm Hg, with only 1% to 5% of patients with COPD manifesting mean PAP > 35 to 40 mm Hg at rest. 54

### A 22-month-old girl with 3 weeks of dyspnea [^115JSv3H]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A previously healthy 22-month-old girl presented to the ED with a 3-week history of dyspnea on exertion. A chest radiograph showed a right upper-lobe opacity suspicious for pneumonia (Fig 1A). The patient was prescribed amoxicillin but returned to the ED 7 days later with cough and persistent dyspnea and tachypnea. At that time, a repeat chest radiograph was concerning for worsening pneumonia (Fig 1B). Treatment with azithromycin and albuterol was initiated, and amoxicillin was discontinued. Her symptoms briefly improved; however, she returned to the ED 10 days later because of worsening cough and tachypnea, and a 2-day history of increased irritability, decreased oral intake, decreased urine output, and intermittent perioral cyanosis. She was afebrile throughout this period per parent report and vital sign documentation at each ED visit.

### A young child with a history of wheeze [^115KCkRF]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Why do the parents request a referral?

A host of reasons may underpin the parent's request. Is their concern that the wheezy episodes are harmful? Are they unable to sleep because the child is disturbed at night? Is it the lack of a clear diagnosis and uncertainty about the boy's long-term prognosis that is causing the worry? Do the parents want advice on avoiding triggers or information on what to do when the wheezing recurs, or is the main focus of this consultation the (perceived) additional value of a referral to a specialist? Or all of these?

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^111ofsmf]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Wheezing and chest tightness — In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), inspiratory and/or expiratory wheezes and chest tightness may vary between days and over a single day, and widespread inspiratory or expiratory wheezes can be present on auscultation. Chest tightness often follows exertion, is poorly localized, is muscular in character, and may arise from isometric contraction of the intercostal muscles. An absence of wheezing or chest tightness does not exclude a diagnosis of COPD, nor does the presence of these symptoms confirm a diagnosis of asthma.

A 16-year-old white boy with a history of chronic lung disease of prematurity, cough-variant asthma, and incidental lung nodules presented to the emergency center in spring 2020 with acute onset dry cough, shortness of breath, and fever. An initial history, gathered from his mother because of the patient's respiratory distress, revealed no recent travel. However, his mother is a health care worker at a hospital, and sick contacts included ongoing contact with a friend with cold-like symptoms. He had a variety of animals at home, including a dog, cats, fish, rodents, and reptiles. He had a history of vaping tobacco products > 6 months ago. Fever and respiratory symptoms were associated with fatigue, chest tightness, abdominal pain, and myalgias. On examination, he was ill appearing and had tachycardia, tachypnea, borderline hypoxia with an oxygen saturation of 91% on room air, diminished breath sounds at the lung bases, and unremarkable abdominal examination results. A chest radiograph was consistent with the lung examination, revealing bilateral lower lobe hazy infiltrates. He showed initial improvement for 48 hours with antibiotics, intravenous fluid resuscitation, oxygen via nasal cannula, albuterol, and prednisone. Subsequently, he worsened with persistent high fever, increasing respiratory distress with pulmonary findings, and severe persistent epigastric pain, which added a layer of diagnostic complexity. As this patient's clinical course evolved and further history became available, pulmonary medicine and infectious diseases services were consulted to guide diagnostic evaluation and treatment of this patient early in the era of coronavirus disease 2019.

Patient information

The patient, a three-and-a-half-year-old boy, presented with complaints of hoarseness, shortness of breath, severe coughing, and severe wheezing since birth. Also presented with clubbing, cyanosis, and failure to thrive (FTT). Despite these signs and symptoms, no diagnostic evaluations were conducted by any of the healthcare professionals consulted. The patient received conservative management based solely on a presumptive diagnosis of asthma. His condition had worsened significantly over the past few months. As a result, his parents have referred him to this center for additional diagnostic tests. The patient's companion reported that the flu worsened the symptoms and that the patient had a history of night snoring and wheezing, was unable to speak fully, and spoke in fragments. The parents also mentioned a history of mild autism and that the patient had a drug history of amoxicillin, azithromycin, adrenaline, and multivitamins. He also had an allergy to the smell of perfume and smoke. The patient was the second child in the family from a 32-year-old mother who had a cesarean section due to placenta previa. Due to the low first-minute Apgar score, the patient was given oxygen therapy for two hours. Due to the developmental delay, he started walking alone at 15 months of age and held his head steady at 9 months of age. Based on the information provided by the patient's mother, it appears that he has difficulty learning.

Assessment of hypoxemia and SDB in SCD — measurement and diagnostic approaches emphasize uncertainties and targets: The research question asks, What are the optimal approaches to evaluating hypoxemia, oxygen desaturation, and SDB?, with supporting questions on which signs and symptoms warrant evaluation for nocturnal respiratory disorders and which alternatives to full, in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG) could identify SDB and nocturnal hypoxemia; the gold standard for measuring blood oxygen content is an arterial blood gas with CO-oximetry that measures carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin, and CO-oximetry is important in SCD because it accounts for hemolysis-related dyshemoglobinemia; pulse oximetry is noninvasive but its accuracy in SCD — particularly during VOEs and/or severe anemia — has been questioned because of rightward shifts of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve and dyshemoglobins that may confound measurements; there is controversy about the appropriate normal oxygen saturation range in SCD, right-to-left shunting has been identified as a possible etiology for desaturation in a subset, yet data suggest the normal range should be similar to healthy control subjects; the gold standard for diagnosis of SDB is overnight, in-laboratory PSG for adults and children and it is expensive and burdensome, and there are insufficient data about accuracy of home sleep apnea testing or other modalities in patients with cardiorespiratory comorbidities including SCD; history and physical examination are inadequate for identifying OSA in children.

4 Conclusion

This case emphasizes the need to maintain a high index of suspicion of primary immunodeficiencies in patients with atypical symptoms, pathogens, and treatment failures, even in previously healthy children. The knowledge of underlying immune pathology has critical implications for the therapeutic strategies and follow‐up management. We suggest incorporating immunologic evaluations, including the oxidative burst test, in the diagnostic workup for children presenting with otherwise unexplained diffuse parenchymal disease.

Background

The causes for new occurrence of dyspnoea are manifold. However, especially cardiologists are confronted with echocardiographic findings more and more often, which are not common in routine daily work – on the one hand due to the increasing age of the population and the associated increasingly recurring cardiac defects which often require surgery and on the other hand due to successfully remediated congenital cardiac defects originated in the early childhood with now normal expectancy of life.

We report the case of a patient who early after aortic valve replacement felt recurring dyspnoea and showed signs of cardiac decompensation.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^115tTXNH]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics — acute bacterial sinusitis diagnosis in children emphasizes differentiating it from uncomplicated viral upper respiratory infection (URI): Uncomplicated viral URIs typically last 5 to 7 days, with respiratory symptoms peaking by days 3 to 6, fever and constitutional symptoms disappearing in the first 24 to 48 hours, and some resolving signs persisting after day 10. Persistence without improvement of nasal discharge (of any quality) or daytime cough (which may be worse at night), or both, suggests acute sinusitis, yet only a minority (~6%–7%) of children with URI symptoms meet criteria for persistence. An alternative presentation is worsening ("double sickening") with substantial acute worsening of respiratory symptoms or a new fever often on the sixth or seventh day after initial recovery. A severe-onset presentation is concurrent high fever (temperature > 39°C) and purulent nasal discharge for the first 3 to 4 days of an acute URI. Bad breath, fatigue, headache, and decreased appetite are not specific indicators, and physical examination, sinus percussion, and transillumination are not helpful; nasopharyngeal cultures do not reliably predict the etiology.

### COPD… [^111mUwAV]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a type of progressive lung disease characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation. GOLD defines COPD as a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms due to abnormalities of the airways or alveoli that cause persistent, often progressive, airflow obstruction. The main symptoms of COPD include shortness of breath and a cough, which may or may not produce mucus. COPD progressively worsens, with everyday activities such as walking or dressing becoming difficult. While COPD is incurable, it is preventable and treatable. The two most common types of COPD are emphysema and chronic bronchitis, and have been the two classic COPD phenotypes.

However, this basic dogma has been challenged as varying degrees of co-existing emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and potentially significant vascular diseases have all been acknowledged in those with COPD, giving rise to the classification of other phenotypes or subtypes. Emphysema is defined as enlarged airspaces whose walls have broken down, resulting in permanent damage to the lung tissue. Chronic bronchitis is defined as a productive cough that is present for at least three months each year for two years. Both of these conditions can exist without airflow limitations when they are not classed as COPD. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis remain the predominant phenotypes of COPD, but there is often overlap between them, and several other phenotypes have also been described. COPD and asthma may coexist and converge in some individuals. COPD is associated with low-grade systemic inflammation.

Signs and symptoms Shortness of breath A cardinal symptom of COPD is the chronic and progressive shortness of breath which is most characteristic of the condition. Shortness of breath is often the most distressing symptom, responsible for the associated anxiety and level of disability experienced. Symptoms of wheezing and chest tightness associated with breathlessness can be variable over the course of a day or between days and are not always present. A chronic productive cough is the result of mucus hypersecretion, and when it persists for more than three months each year for at least two years, it is defined as chronic bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis can occur before the restricted airflow diagnostic of COPD. Some people with COPD attribute the symptoms to the consequences of smoking. In severe COPD, vigorous coughing may lead to rib fractures or to a brief loss of consciousness.

The number of exacerbations is not seen to relate to any stage of the disease; those with two or more a year are classed as frequent exacerbators and these lead to a worsening in the disease progression. Frailty in ageing increases exacerbations and hospitalization. Acute exacerbations in COPD are often unexplained and thought to have many causes other than infections. A study has emphasized the possibility of a pulmonary embolism as sometimes being responsible in these cases. Signs can include pleuritic chest pain and heart failure without signs of infection. Such emboli could respond to anticoagulants. It is advised that everybody with COPD be screened for A1AD. Metabolic syndrome has been seen to affect up to fifty percent of those with COPD and significantly affects the outcomes. When comorbid with COPD there is more systemic inflammation. It is not known if it co-exists with COPD or develops as a consequence of the pathology.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^116GDJuq]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

BRUE diagnosis — Patient presents for initial medical assessment after a brief, resolved event that was observed by caregiver in a child < 1 year of age, and the patient may be well-appearing or have additional symptoms or abnormal vital signs; use event characteristics, rather than the term "ALTE", to describe the event. The clinician characterizes the event as a sudden, brief, and now resolved episode of one or more of the following, including cyanosis or pallor, absent, decreased, or irregular breathing, marked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia), or altered responsiveness. If event criteria are present, perform appropriate history and physical examination (PE); if no explanation for the event is identified, diagnosis of Brief Resolved Unexplained Event is made, whereas if an explanation for the event is identified (eg, GER, feeding difficulties, or airway abnormality) it is out of guideline scope and should be managed accordingly.

### Idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis in childhood [^111EDChQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Case presentation

A child presented to the outpatient department accompanied by his parents, with complaints of difficulty in breathing for the past 2 days. According to the father, the child's distress had increased progressively over the past 2 days. There was no history of any consanguinity or any history of illnesses running in the family. The child used to get an adequate and well-balanced diet. On examination, the child had tachypnoea with respiratory rates of around 40 breaths per minute, tachycardia with heart rates around 150–160 beats per minute, fever and cyanosis with saturation on room air being 60%. The child was immediately transferred to paediatric intensive care unit (PICU), where respiratory support was initiated using heated humidified high-flow oxygen via nasal cannula (HHFNC). The child had crepitations and rhonchi in bilateral lower zones of the lung on auscultation, nasal flaring, subcostal and intercostal retractions. The child was conscious and oriented to time, place and person. The child had severe pallor as visible on palms and palpebral conjunctiva. Abdomen was soft with no hepatosplenomegaly, cardiovascular system examination revealed tachycardia with no murmurs. 2D echocardiography of the child was within normal limits with no structural anomaly and no pulmonary hypertension. An X-ray of the chest (CXR) obtained in the PICU revealed diffuse consolidations and ground-glass opacities (figure 1). In view of anaemia, packed red blood cells were transfused. Methylprednisolone was given in view of respiratory distress and rhonchi. Empirical broad antibiotics (piperacillin+tazobactam) were given after obtaining blood cultures. Respiratory distress gradually settled on high-flow nasal cannula within 4 hours. Oxygen saturation gradually improved to around 90–95% on HHFNC, and signs of respiratory distress settled. The child was kept on high-flow oxygen therapy for 36 hours and gradually weaned off the respiratory support. A CXR was repeated after 36 hours, which appeared considerably better than before with considerable clearing of lung parenchyma (figure 2). The child was then shifted to wards and discharged on oral iron supplements. The child was again readmitted with similar signs and symptoms after 2 months. The child appeared pale, and a repeat CXR showed diffuse ground-glass opacities and consolidation. On second admission, while the child was on non-invasive respiratory support, bone marrow aspirate and other relevant blood workup for anaemia were sent. Similar two such episodes of anaemia and respiratory distress occurred after 1 and 2 months, respectively. On every admission, respiratory distress gradually settled after giving corticosteroids. On the last admission, we got a high-resolution CT (HRCT) of the chest of the child, which revealed multiple areas of consolidation and ground-glass opacities (figures3 5). We also attempted to obtain a bronchoscopic alveolar lavage of the child. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample was obtained by wedging the fibreoptic bronchoscope on the right middle lobe and the left lower lobe. Cytology of the BAL sample revealed haemosiderin-laden macrophages. BAL cytology (figure 6) confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary haemosiderosis, after which the child was started on maintenance immunosuppression with prednisolone at 0.75 mg/kg/day.

Methods

Study design and participants

Case development and presentation

We worked with the Advisory Committee of Kenyan doctors and nurses to develop tracer conditions, construct medically relevant checklists and assign correct case management protocols, with review from medical professionals. Generally healthy individuals were selected for case presentations so that physical examination would not lead providers to alternative diagnoses, and SP responses to relevant history questions were scripted such that appropriate questioning and examinations by a healthcare provider should have led to correct diagnoses for all patients.

The case presentations and correct treatments are detailed in table 1. The four cases were: (1) unstable angina, in which a 45-year-old man complains of being awoken suddenly by severe chest pain in the morning; (2) diarrhoea, in which the mother of an 18-month-old complains that her child has diarrhoea and requests medicines; (3) asthma, in which the patient complains of severe shortness of breath with specific triggers and, if asked, a history of similar attacks; and (4) tuberculosis (TB), in which the patient first complains of persistent cough, later revealing the duration and admitting to night sweats and weight loss.

Table 1
Standardised patient case descriptions

The choice of these tracer conditions reflects their relevance in the Kenyan setting along with the availability of established medical protocols for triage, management and treatment. For example, among children aged 5 years or under, diarrhoea is the third most common cause of mortality and morbidity in Kenya. In Nairobi, rates of specific symptoms associated with asthma in children were as high as 25% — twice as frequent as in surrounding rural areas.TB is the fourth most lethal infectious disease in Kenya, with an incidence of 233 cases per 100 000 population and a high mortality rate of 20 deaths per 100 000 population; in addition, one in three patients with TB whose HIV status is known is HIV-positive, posing an especially challenging comorbidity profile. Finally, ischaemic heart disease is now the tenth leading cause of death in Kenya, just after malaria and TB, and may become an increasingly prevalent condition as the population ages.

### Complete obstruction of proximal left ascending artery in a very young woman with Kawasaki: a case report and literature review [^114uLuka]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

The patient was a 24-year-old woman who presented with an intermittent Shortness of breath (SOB) and declared a history of Kawasaki disease in her infancy. The symptoms were not severe and had not affected the daily activities significantly. On her physical exam, no abnormal finding was observed, and vital signs were stable. Considering her past medical history and background with Kawasaki disease, cardiovascular diseases were suggested as a responsible factor. The background disease was diagnosed with ASA and IVIG and had no other manifestations after her childhood. No past FH or PMH was declared. No history of smoking, previous surgery, or allergy to food and medications was declared.

Therefore, a CT angiography was planned, which showed a mild narrowing of LAD, which was not significant, and patency of other coronary vessels (Fig. 1). The patient was discharged with a recommendation to take ASA 80 mg daily, Clopidogrel 75 mg daily, and Atorvastatin 40 mg once a night. In her follow-up, no significant change was seen. However, after ten years, when she was 34, she presented with overt symptoms of chest pain at exertion and rest and exertional SOB, suggestive of CAD and DHF. On general appearance, an anxious woman with evident dyspnea could be observed. On vital sign evaluation, the oxygen saturation on ambient air declined (86%), normal blood pressure (130/90), high respiratory rate, and tachycardia (111) could be observed. The physical examination showed bilateral lung crackles and 2 + edema was seen on the lower extremities. The respiration was performed with the help of accessory abdominal muscles.

### Postobstructive pulmonary edema in a 40-year-old man after suffocation by a swimming pool cover [^115UdVAk]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Postobstructive pulmonary edema (POPE) is a form of sudden onset, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema that can occur after the relief of an upper airway obstruction.

Objective

Since POPE is an uncommon diagnosis made in the emergency department (ED), this case is presented to increase emergency physicians' awareness of the etiology, pathophysiology, and management of this type of edema.

Case Report

This is a case of bilateral POPE in a 40-year-old man with no history of cardiac or pulmonary disease who experienced near suffocation due to the vacuum effect of a swimming pool cover. On presentation to the ED, the patient's symptoms included bilateral pleuritic pain over the anterior chest, shortness of breath, and inspiratory cough. He was tachycardic and tachypneic, with an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Pertinent physical examination findings included shallow breathing and right-sided rhonchi. The initial arterial blood gas on room air demonstrated a PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio of 304 mm Hg. Cardiac enzymes and the electrocardiogram result were normal. The patient's chest radiograph was interpreted as having marked bilateral pulmonary edema. The patient was admitted to the Medicine Intensive Care Unit and placed on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). The patient was clinically asymptomatic and was discharged after 72 h.

Conclusions

Emergency physicians should consider the diagnosis of POPE in a symptomatic patient if there is evidence of pulmonary edema immediately after a history of hanging, suffocation, strangulation, choking, naloxone administration, or other forms of upper airway obstruction. Rapid initiation of NIPPV with or without diuretics, steroids, or fluid restriction can lead to symptom resolution within 24 to 48 h.

Diagnosis of asthma

It is critical to confirm the diagnosis of asthma

Primary care clinicians are consulted by patients with many hundreds of different medical conditions in any year. Every day, they are faced with the challenge of quickly arriving at an accurate diagnosis in limited time, and often with limited access to specialized investigations.

In order to ensure diagnosis of asthma is considered as early as possible, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion when patients present with respiratory symptoms.

Over- and under-diagnosis of asthma are common and are usually due to the lack of objective lung function testing which can demonstrate variable expiratory airflow limitation that will support the diagnosis of asthma and help to exclude other causes. For continuity of care, it is important to ensure that the diagnosis is recorded in each patient's medical record, detailing the basis for the diagnosis, including objective measurements of variable airflow obstruction and airway inflammation, if available. These details are often lacking in the medical records of childrenand adults treated for asthma.

Medical records should also contain details of treatment prescribed, education given to help patients understand the chronic nature of their disease, and provision of a personal written action plan to enable them to change their treatment and seek assistance when needed.

Diagnosing asthma in adults, adolescents and children aged 6–11 years

Confirm the diagnosis of asthma before starting controller treatment, if possible

There is no single test for confirming the diagnosis of asthma. First, a clinical diagnosis starts with a history of respiratory symptoms (such as cough, wheeze, difficulty breathing and/or shortness of breath) that typically vary over time and intensity (Table 2 and Fig. 1). Symptoms of asthma are often worse at night and in the early morning, and may be triggered by factors such as viral infections, allergen exposure, exercise, strong smells, cigarette smoke, exhaust fumes and laughter. When taking a history, it may be helpful to show patients or carers a video depicting typical symptoms, such as the one developed by Wellington School of Medical and Health Sciences, University of Otago, New Zealand, available from the Global Asthma Network website. Physical examination may be entirely normal.

Case Presentation

A 59-year-old woman sought treatment for 5 weeks of progressive exercise intolerance. At the time of presentation, dyspnea limited her ability to speak in complete sentences. She also reported new orthopnea. Her respiratory symptoms improved with rest and while standing. She endorsed associated intermittent low-grade fevers, cough productive of scant clear sputum, lower extremity swelling, bloating, weight loss, and reduced appetite. She had undergone two recent admissions with similar symptoms to other hospitals, during which she was treated empirically for community-acquired pneumonia and discharged after workups for infectious disease were unrevealing. She had a history notable for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) diagnosed in 2006, complicated by lupus nephritis in 2009. Most recently, her SLE had been quiescent while she was taking hydroxychloroquine (400 mg daily) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF; 1 g twice daily). She reported baseline mild dyspnea with exertion since she received a diagnosis of SLE, but her symptoms had not previously affected her activities of daily living. The patient did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use recreational drugs, and her family history was unremarkable.

The guideline applies to "infants younger than 1 year", notes that "the presence of respiratory symptoms or fever would preclude classification of an event as a BRUE", and states that BRUEs are also "unexplained". For infants who appear well after such an event, "the risk of a serious underlying disorder or a recurrent event is extremely low".

Case presentation

A 29-year-old woman was referred to our department for evaluation of unclear exertional dyspnea with extreme functional limitation.

She had experienced breathing difficulties and performance limitations since early childhood. A medical examination at 6 years of age had shown tachycardia, low blood pressure, and a normal electrocardiogram. Subsequently, her symptoms had worsened and she had developed severe pain and increasing weakness in her leg muscles. At 15 years of age, she was diagnosed with exercise-induced asthma. At 16 years of age, she underwent low-stress ergometry, which caused a sharp increase in heart rate there (a sharp increase in already at 20 watts from 100 to 160/min and at 60 watts to 200/min) with extreme shortness of breath. In CPET (bicycle, 3 min at 25 watts followed by 3 min at 50 watts), the respiratory quotient at rest was 1.02 and oxygen uptake (VO 2) increased from 1.76 ml/min/kg to a maximum of 13.8 ml/kg/min. Echocardiography showed mild to moderate left ventricular hypertrophy, which declined after 3 years of beta-blocker therapy. She was not under beta-blocker therapy when referred to our department.

### Recurrent lower respiratory illnesses among young children in rural Kyrgyzstan: overuse of antibiotics and possible under-diagnosis of asthma. A qualitative FRESH AIR study [^115pCV72]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Perceptions: illness description, terminology and causes

Eight of the 13 interviewed caregivers explained that their child had suffered from recurrent or long-term periods of respiratory illness, with noisy and/or difficult breathing, often peaking at night, lasting weeks or months, which often started in infancy. They used phrases like: constant cough, worsening of cough, wet cough with phlegm, sputum in the bronchi, hurried breathing, noisy or loud breathing, breathing with whistling in the breast, unable to breathe, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. Sometimes the illness was accompanied by fever. The respiratory illnesses were frequently in autumn, winter and spring. The expression wheezing was not used by any of the caregivers. The other five children had milder coughs for several periods.

CG1 (Boy 21 months, Naryn): He was already coughing, when I was putting him into cradle. Suddenly I noticed, he was coughing and unable to breathe, turned red… Now the dry cough is constant, shortness of breath occurs seldom… The child doesn't get well, cough is persistent, no matter what I try.

CG2, (Grandmother, boy 31 months, Naryn): Yes, it happened in February, when for a month or two months there was a shortness of breath and noisy breathing. The child came down with a respiratory illness when he was 1 year old. There were 4–5 episodes of noisy and complicated breathing… Usually the cough reaches its peak at nights or early in the morning, when the local health posts are closed… Yes, 6 times the child was in the hospital with a cough, sometimes with shortness of breath and increased body temperature.

The HPs responded, when presented with the case history of repeated cough and respiratory distress, that they saw many such cases, several quite severe. A paramedic mentioned around 150 cases a year and a family doctor noted 100 respiratory admissions a year.

HP18 (Paramedic, Chui): Children with chronic bronchitis come, their condition is usually severe: breathing with help of an auxiliary musculature, shortness of breathing, and with normal body temperature.

HP14 (Family doctor, Naryn): There are more admissions with bronchitis and colds. About 100 children during the year and around 3–4 with difficult breathing.

|-|-|
|Recurrent acute wheezing episodes with or without asthma-like symptoms between episodes|- At least 2 acute episodes (lasting > 24 hours) of asthma-like signs/symptoms (such as wheezing on expiration, accessory muscle use, difficult and/or heavy breathing), with wheezing confirmed during at least 1 episode, OR <br/> - At least 1 acute wheezing episode (lasting > 24 hours) with wheezing confirmed and with asthma-like symptoms between wheezing episodes (|
|No likely alternative cause for the respiratory symptoms|- No other condition (except for a concurrent viral respiratory infection) is likely to explain the asthma-like signs/symptoms based on a thorough medical history and examination <br/> - Avoid obtaining imaging or laboratory tests|
|Timely clinical response to acute or longer-term asthma treatment|- During an acute wheezing episode in a healthcare setting, confirmed improvement of respiratory symptoms and signs within 20–60 minutes after administration of short-acting β-agonist or, for more severe episodes, within 3–4 hours after short-acting β-agonist and oral corticosteroid are commenced, OR <br/> - At home, the parent/caregiver reports that the child's wheezing or difficulty breathing improves within 20–60 minutes after being given short-acting β-agonist, OR <br/> - During a 2–3-month trial of daily ICS (100–250 mcg/day fluticasone-propionate equivalent by pressurized metered-dose inhaler via spacer) plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist, the parent/caregiver reports a decrease in the severity and/or frequency of the child's acute wheezing episodes or asthma-like symptoms between acute wheezing episodes.|

Case Presentation

A 63-year-old Japanese woman with no medical history presented as an outside hospital transfer for further management of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Per her family, the patient had developed a rash and intermittent shortness of breath 2 months prior to hospital presentation. The rash was described as an erythematous maculopapular rash located on her proximal arms, chest, and upper eyelids. She saw her primary care physician, who prescribed a course of oral and topical corticosteroids. Despite these symptoms, the patient had an excellent functional status and exercised several times per week without muscle weakness. Two months following the initial presentation, the patient progressively became lethargic, prompting her son to bring her to the hospital for admission and evaluation. While in the hospital, the patient had progressive shortness of breath and developed worsening hypoxemic respiratory failure. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, her hypoxemia worsened, requiring intubation. She was subsequently started on 80 mg of IV methylprednisolone three times daily and transferred to our institution for further management. The patient arrived from the outside hospital receiving deep sedation and paralysis. Despite maximal ventilator settings, the patient remained hypoxemic and developed shock requiring multiple vasopressors.

### Classification of cough as a symptom in adults and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112cKeqV]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

CHEST guideline — Subacute cough algorithm: In patients ≥ 15 years of age with cough lasting 3 to 8 weeks, always screen for the presence of red flags and perform history and physical examination asking about red flags, environmental and occupational factors, and travel exposures. If a postinfectious or life-threatening diagnosis is suspected (pneumonia, severe exacerbation of asthma or COPD, PE, heart failure, other serious disease), evaluate and treat first, and consider TB in endemic areas and in high risk groups; if not postinfectious, the workup is the same as chronic cough. Assess for possible new onset or exacerbation of a pre-existing condition, and note that GERD is gastroesophageal reflux disease and NAEB is nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis. Reminders include to routinely assess cough severity or quality of life before and after treatment and to routinely follow patients 4 to 6 weeks after the initial visit. Red flags include hemoptysis; smoker > 45 years of age with a new cough, change in cough, or coexisting voice disturbance; adults aged 55–80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or who have quit within the past 15 years; prominent dyspnea, especially at rest or at night; trouble swallowing when eating or drinking; vomiting; recurrent pneumonia; and history of abnormal respiratory exam and/or abnormal chest radiograph coinciding with duration of cough.

### Recurrent rash in an 11-year-old boy with pericardial and pleural effusions [^112cSXw1]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

An 11-year-old, previously healthy boy presented to the emergency center (EC) for acute respiratory distress in the setting of 5 months of recurrent and worsening rash with progressive fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, and cough. At the onset of his rash, he and his younger brothers were diagnosed with roseola. Although his brothers' symptoms resolved, the patient's rash recurred, prompting his primary care provider to prescribe amoxicillin. The rash subsequently worsened, so amoxicillin was stopped; a prednisone course was prescribed which alleviated the rash. Upon completion of the prednisone course, the rash returned more diffusely with associated symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain, and cough. Because of these symptoms, his mother brought him to the EC, where his vitals were notable for tachypnea and tachycardia. His initial EC imaging workup was remarkable for an echocardiogram with a mild to moderate circumferential pericardial effusion, chest x-ray (CXR) with a large right pleural effusion, and chest computerized tomography significant for prominent and diffuse mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy with numerous enlarged axillary lymph nodes. Laboratory results were notable for elevated liver enzymes, inflammatory markers, d-dimer, and brain natriuretic peptide. Differential diagnosis remained broad, including infectious, oncologic, and rheumatologic etiologies. Our panel of experts reviews the evaluation, hospital course, and treatment of this patient presenting with an unusual rash and serositis.

### Delayed presentation of amiodarone extravasation-induced skin necrosis: a case report with discussion on management [^112SzHDA]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

This case report has been prepared in compliance with the Case Report guidelines to ensure transparency and standardization.

A 30-year-old male with a history of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, developmental delay (nonverbal at baseline), mild intermittent asthma, stage 3a chronic kidney disease, presented to the emergency department with a 1-day history of fever and shortness of breath.

On admission, he was tachycardic, febrile, and tachypneic. The physical exam was positive for rhonchi, and he was diagnosed with sepsis due to pneumonia, after which antibiotics were started. Two days later, he developed atrial fibrillation rhythm with rapid ventricular response and underwent pharmacological cardioversion with intravenous amiodarone via a large-bore peripheral IV placed in the antecubital fossa cannula. The amiodarone was diluted in dextrose at a concentration of 150 mg/100 mL (1.5 mg/mL) for the loading dose and was administered once at 600 mL/hr over 10 minutes using a 0.22-micron inline filter. Unfortunately, 10 minutes later, the cannula became tissued, leading to significant extravasation of amiodarone into the soft tissue. The affected arm was elevated, and warm compresses were applied by nursing staff. The patient developed mild swelling in the elbow and forearm, but no clinical signs of significant tissue damage were evident on examination. Therefore, subcutaneous hyaluronidase administration was deferred. On the day of extravasation, the patient also developed aspiration pneumonia, became hypoxic, was intubated, and subsequently transferred to the intensive care unit. Due to being intubated, sedated, and nonverbal, the patient was unable to express pain at the site of extravasation.

### From dyspnea to diagnosis: a pediatric case report on an unexpected condition [^116Mwvu7]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

3 Discussion

A 7‐year‐old patient with no history of severe infections presented with sudden onset of dyspnea, fever, and acute respiratory insufficiency. Although this clinical condition is usually associated with an acute respiratory infection, a rare primary immunodeficiency was eventually diagnosed. The borderline growth represented the only finding indicative of possible chronicity. Because the respiratory failure did not respond to first‐line therapeutic approaches, a detailed pulmonary evaluation was performed, revealing acute diffuse lung parenchymal disease. While the chest CT pattern can usually narrow the otherwise extensive differential diagnoses, in our case the lung involvement combined with skin involvement, required an extensive workup to exclude a range of diagnoses, such as sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and vasculitis. The diffuse nodular pattern with hilar lymphadenopathy also warranted an oncologic screening in search of possible malignancy. Finally, the history of mold and mulch exposure, high levels of specific IgG antibodies against molds together with the corresponding CT pattern suggested the diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP). However, at the initial stage, several aspects were unclear. First, the association of HP with skin lesions was elusive. Second, an ongoing fungal lung infection had to be thoroughly assessed, particularly as the targeted examinations were inconclusive. Third, although the CMV positivity in BAL did not match the short history of symptoms, CMV infection may, in rare cases, present as diffuse parenchymal pattern on CT scan and, as such, CMV pneumonia had to be considered in the differential diagnosis. Eventually, given the atypical combination of symptoms and pathogens, an underlying immune pathology was considered and confirmed to be CGD, altering the course of the child's management.

### First time wheezing in a 2-year-old [^113q4mwd]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Pediatric patients with respiratory signs and symptoms who are found to be wheezing present a diagnostic dilemma to pediatricians. The majority of these cases are diagnosed as some degree of reactive airway disease, either as viral bronchiolitis or asthma. In this scenario, a patient with wheezing was initially given 2 courses of appropriate antibiotics on the basis of the duration and concurrence of other symptoms. However, he was subsequently referred to a pediatric pulmonologist for further workup after failure to improve and persistent oxygen saturations in the low-to-mid 90s. More extensive testing was completed by the pediatric pulmonologist, in addition to a short hospital admission. A rigid bronchoscopy was eventually completed, which revealed small pieces of partially digested material. Although his persistent cough resolved, his saturations continued to be suboptimal. A chest computed tomography scan with contrast was then completed, which eventually led to his diagnosis and appropriate treatment and resolution of his symptoms.

2.7 Learner reflection

(1) What is most likely happening to this patient?
(2) How would you monitor this patient for treatment response and improvement?

Listen to Podcastto hear the consortium's decision‐making progress.

The patient underwent inhalation therapy with rGM‐CSF in cycles of 14 days, following a total treatment schedule of 6 months. The patient received 125 μg inhaled rGM‐CSF twice daily during the first half of the 6 months and once daily during the latter half. Please see the Supporting Information S1: Table S1 for the specific treatment regimen.

Clinical improvements such as tachypnoea, retractions, dry cough, and increasing SpO₂ in RA to 96% were observed within 1 month; however, objective parameters such as PFT did not improve adequately, and the second treatment period was administered, resulting in further improvements: FEV₁ increased to 69%, DL CO was 53%, and the 6‐MWT distance increased to 702 m (Figure 3). Chest X‐rays showed reduced bilateral ground‐glass opacity, and the P (A‐a) decreased to 14 mmHg (Figure 4). Although PFT improved, they plateaued at subnormal values, leading to a third treatment period, during which significant PFT improvements were observed (FEV₁: 86%, FVC: 83%, DL CO: 88%, TLC: 82%, RV: 73%). The improvement trend in the patient's PFT, body mass index, SpO₂, and 6‐MWT is shown in Figure 3. His respiratory rate was 22/min.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: diagnosis and… [^114v5ExK]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

INHALED CORTICOSTEROIDS Inhaled corticosteroids are not recommended as monotherapy in COPD. They do not improve mortality or FEV. 1 and increase the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis and pneumonia. 3, 20, 23 In conjunction with long-acting inhaled bronchodilators, ICS triple therapy decreases COPD exacerbation frequency and improves quality of life. 3, 23 A meta-analysis reviewing triple therapy with ICS/LAMA/LABA combinations showed an NNT of 16 to reduce one exacerbation in 12 months and a number needed to harm of 64 for one episode of pneumonia in 12 months compared with LAMA/LABA combinations. 24 Triple therapy reduces exacerbations and improves lung function compared with ICS/LABA or LAMA/LABA combinations in patients 40 years and older with symptomatic COPD and no more than one moderate or severe exacerbation in the past year. 24, 25 In patients with COPD who have blood eosinophil counts of 300 cells per μL or more, adding an ICS further reduces exacerbations but also increases the risk of pneumonia. Consider discontinuing the ICS if patients have been stable for 12 months.
20. 3 A 2020 Cochrane review found that PDE-4 inhibitors modestly improved lung function and reduced symptoms and the likelihood of COPD exacerbations with an NNT of 17 to prevent one exacerbation over 39 weeks compared with placebo. 26 Most studies in the review used PDE-4 inhibitors as monotherapy in patients with symptoms of bronchitis. Although there are limited data for the use of PDE-4 inhibitors in conjunction with LAMA/LABA and LAMA/LABA/ICS combinations, they are recommended for adjunctive therapy after optimizing inhaled medications. 3, 4, 20. PROPHYLACTIC ANTIBIOTICS The use of prophylactic antibiotics for patients with COPD is not common but can be considered on an individual basis to reduce exacerbations.

3, 4, 20 A Cochrane review showed that prophylactic treatment with a macrolide antibiotic reduced COPD exacerbations with an NNT of 8 to prevent one exacerbation over 50 weeks. 27 Antimicrobial resistance to prophylactic antibiotics has been shown. Several studies reported resistance, but no pooled analysis has been completed to demonstrate the amount of resistance developed. 27, 28 The GOLD guidelines caution that macrolides may cause QTc prolongation and antibiotic resistance. Prophylaxis with tetracyclines and fluroquinolones shows no benefit and increased harms. 27 Prophylactic antibiotic therapy should be reserved for patients with frequent exacerbations who have been optimized on inhaled therapies. MUCOLYTICS AND ANTITUSSIVES Mucolytics may reduce exacerbations by approximately one in three years of treatment. Because there are limited data, it may be difficult to identify which patients may benefit.

Anti-tussives are not recommended for long-term management of COPD because there is no evidence of benefit.
3. **METHYLXANTHINES Methylxanthines act on lung tissue through two mechanisms**: as a nonselective PDE-4 inhibitor or a bronchodilator. Because of a low therapeutic ratio, low toxicity thresholds, and significant interactions with other commonly used medications, methylxanthines are not generally recommended. 3, 29. ORAL CORTICOSTEROIDS Oral corticosteroids have a high adverse effect profile and are used primarily as an adjunctive treatment for acute exacerbations in hospitalized patients or those seen in the emergency department. They are not recommended for routine use in the daily management of COPD. 3, 4, 20 Oral corticosteroids do not reduce symptoms, exacerbations, or hospitalizations but increase adverse effects with an NNH of 6.

### A 13-year-old male patient with severe multifocal pneumonia and bronchiectasis that required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [^1137ZBZF]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 13-year-old male patient with intermittent asthma and joint hypermobility presented to the ED in acute hypoxemic respiratory distress. He reported experiencing cough, increased work of breathing, and worsening chest pain for 3 days before presentation. He also reported fatigue and decreased appetite for 2 weeks. He had no known fever, myalgias, or recent weight loss. His medical history included two hospitalizations during early childhood for viral respiratory illnesses, one of which required intubation at 8 months of age. He had a gastrostomy tube placed shortly after his hospitalization because of failure to thrive secondary to aspiration based on a swallow study. His weight gain and growth improved with adequate nutrition, and his gastrostomy tube was removed at 2 years of age. His newborn screen, which included immunoreactive trypsinogen, was normal. He was noted to have hypermobile joints on physical examination at a clinic visit in childhood, but his examination results were not concerning for a hypermobility syndrome, and further diagnosis was not pursued. His parents endorsed that he has been a "healthy child" overall other than the occasional cough, which was attributed to asthma. His lifestyle was described as sedentary; he did not play any sports or have any unusual hobbies. He did not take any daily medications and no environmental exposures were reported. There was no family history of pulmonary, autoimmune, or connective tissue disease.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115ppn5R]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for asthma, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to diagnose asthma in adult, adolescent, and pediatric (aged 6–11 years) patients based on typical variable respiratory symptoms and confirmed variable expiratory airflow:

- **Wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and cough**: symptoms occurring variably over time and vary in intensity; symptoms often worse at night or on waking; symptoms often triggered by exercise, laughter, allergens, cold air; symptoms worsen after end-exercise (very distinctive); symptoms often appearing or worsening with viral infections

- **Confirmed excessive variability in lung function (≥ 1 of the following)**: positive bronchodilator responsiveness test with spirometry (or peak expiratory flow); excessive variability in twice-daily peak expiratory flow over 2 weeks; increase in lung function after 4 weeks of ICS-containing treatment; positive bronchial challenge test; excessive variation in lung function between visits.
