## Question

Tell me about upper Limb superficial veins thrombosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about upper limb superficial vein thrombosis (UESVT). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining UESVT and distinguishing it from UEDVT. Then, I should verify epidemiology and risk factors, especially catheter-related etiologies. Next, I will review diagnostic strategies, including ultrasound and D-dimer. After that, I need to appraise treatment options and guideline positions, including when to anticoagulate. Finally, I should consider special populations, prognosis, and synthesize a practical management algorithm with explicit uncertainties and evidence gaps.

> Let me first confirm the definition and scope. Upper limb superficial vein thrombosis is thrombosis of the superficial veins of the arm, such as the basilic, cephalic, or median cubital veins, and is distinct from upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (UEDVT) which involves the axillary, subclavian, or brachial veins; this distinction matters because management and risk profiles differ substantially, and I should be careful not to conflate them in recommendations [^notfound].

> I need to check epidemiology and risk factors. UESVT is common in hospitalized patients with peripheral intravenous catheters, with reported thrombophlebitis rates ranging from 20% to 80% in some series, far exceeding the 5% benchmark from nursing guidelines; this iatrogenic burden underscores the need for prevention and surveillance strategies in high-risk patients and settings [^1edb6677]. Hold on, I should verify patient- and catheter-specific risks: patient factors include immunocompromise, diabetes, malignancy, prior thrombophlebitis, burns, and higher hemoglobin, while catheter factors include larger bore, longer dwell time, and certain infusates such as potassium chloride and antibiotics; dedicated IV teams and enhanced nursing care reduce risk, which is actionable for quality improvement [^1edb6677].

> Next, I should review diagnostic strategy. Wait, let me verify the role of ultrasound: duplex ultrasonography is the first-line modality to confirm UESVT and to exclude concomitant DVT, which occurs in a meaningful minority and changes management; whole-arm protocols improve detection and safety-netting when initial studies are nondiagnostic, and repeating ultrasound in 5–7 days is reasonable when technical limitations obscure key segments [^a52f3a80] [^c3aaa58f]. I should double-check D-dimer: while D-dimer has high sensitivity and negative predictive value for UEDVT, its utility for isolated UESVT is limited and not well validated; thus, D-dimer is not routinely recommended to diagnose UESVT, though a negative result in a low-probability UEDVT pathway can be reassuring when combined with clinical assessment [^c3aaa58f] [^c19bc4e1].

> Now, treatment decisions hinge on severity, extension, and patient risk. Let me think about the evidence base: for catheter-related UESVT, most cases are self-limited and respond to conservative measures; a Cochrane review of upper-extremity infusion thrombophlebitis found low-quality evidence and no clear superiority of topical or systemic therapies, so routine anticoagulation is not supported in uncomplicated, short-segment cases [^aec83b50]. Hold on, I should verify pediatric guidance: the ASH/ISTH pediatric guideline recommends no anticoagulation for upper-extremity SVT secondary to IV cannulation, reflecting very low certainty and the benign natural history in this context, which aligns with a conservative approach in children [^3fa17136] [^ca33b7c8].

> But wait, what if the thrombus is extensive or near the deep system? I should confirm the threshold for anticoagulation: when UESVT is extensive (generally ≥ 5 cm), progressive, or within about 3 cm of the axillary or subclavian junction, the risk of extension into the deep veins increases and anticoagulation is reasonable; fondaparinux 2.5 mg daily for 6 weeks is supported by extrapolation from lower-extremity SVT trials showing reduced progression and VTE, though high-quality upper-extremity data are lacking and this remains a conditional recommendation in many pathways [^ed657477] [^381d1f92]. I need to ensure I note alternatives: rivaroxaban 10 mg daily for 6 weeks is an accepted oral alternative in patients who prefer to avoid injections, again based on lower-extremity evidence and expert consensus rather than head-to-head upper-extremity trials [^ed657477].

> Let me consider supportive care that actually helps. NSAIDs improve pain and may reduce local extension in lower-extremity SVT, but they do not reliably prevent VTE; thus, if used for symptom control, I should pair them with ultrasound surveillance when risk is nontrivial and avoid relying on NSAIDs alone when extension risk is high or the thrombus is proximal [^381d1f92] [^ed657477]. Compression therapy can reduce edema and discomfort, and warm compresses may help symptoms, though high-quality upper-extremity data are sparse; practically, many clinicians use compression sleeves or bandaging when tolerated, especially for larger, painful superficial clots [^c6a734ad].

> I should confirm special populations and contexts. In pregnancy, management is individualized; if anticoagulation is indicated for extensive UESVT, low molecular weight heparin is preferred due to safety, with shared decision-making given the limited direct evidence. In patients with active cancer, a lower threshold for anticoagulation is reasonable given baseline VTE risk, again extrapolating from general VTE principles and observational data in UEDVT cohorts showing higher recurrence in malignancy [^e59a0f36]. For pediatric patients, I already noted the recommendation to avoid anticoagulation for cannulation-related UESVT, reserving anticoagulation for non-cannula–related SVT or lower-extremity SVT with cancer or varicosities, reflecting very low certainty and the predominance of iatrogenic, self-limited cases in children [^3fa17136] [^ca33b7c8].

> Next, I should review prognosis and complications. Recurrent VTE after UESVT is uncommon in observational series, with one cohort showing only 1 recurrence among 55 UESVT patients over 3.5 years, supporting the generally favorable outlook when managed appropriately; mortality in that cohort was driven by comorbidities rather than thrombotic recurrence, reinforcing the need to address underlying illness [^e59a0f36]. Hold on, I should verify PTS risk: upper-extremity post-thrombotic syndrome is well described after UEDVT but is far less common after isolated UESVT; when it occurs, it is usually mild and often relates to prior deep venous involvement or persistent mechanical obstruction rather than pure superficial disease [^08b0f826] [^54d9bb59].

> I will now examine prevention, because reducing iatrogenic UESVT matters. Let me reconsider catheter practices: using the smallest effective catheter, minimizing dwell time, avoiding high-irritancy infusions when possible, and employing IV therapy teams reduce thrombophlebitis rates; these are practical, evidence-aligned steps that can materially lower incidence in hospitalized patients [^1edb6677]. I should double-check that these measures are emphasized in quality initiatives, as the absolute numbers affected are large given the frequency of peripheral IV use [^1edb6677].

> Finally, I need to synthesize a practical algorithm and state uncertainties. For suspected UESVT, obtain duplex ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis and exclude DVT; if ultrasound is nondiagnostic due to technical factors, repeat in 5–7 days or consider whole-arm protocols to improve visualization [^a52f3a80]. For short-segment, nonprogressive, catheter-related UESVT, manage conservatively with NSAIDs, local care, and compression as tolerated, reserving anticoagulation for extension or high-risk features; for extensive thrombus (≥ 5 cm), progressive symptoms, or proximity to the deep system, treat with fondaparinux 2.5 mg daily or rivaroxaban 10 mg daily for 6 weeks, with ultrasound follow-up to ensure stability and resolution [^ed657477] [^381d1f92]. I should emphasize that many upper-extremity recommendations are extrapolated from lower-extremity data and expert consensus, and that high-quality, upper-extremity–specific randomized trials are needed to refine thresholds, durations, and agent selection; until then, shared decision-making and individualized risk assessment remain essential [^aec83b50] [^e59a0f36].

Upper limb superficial vein thrombosis (UESVT) is **most often catheter-related** [^1edb6677] and usually presents with localized pain, erythema, and a palpable cord [^notfound]. Diagnosis relies on **duplex ultrasound** [^a52f3a80] to confirm SVT and exclude DVT or PE, which occur in 6–44% and 2–13% of cases, respectively [^42b8d334]. Management is **conservative** for most patients, with NSAIDs, compression, and warm compresses; anticoagulation is reserved for extensive thrombus (> 5 cm), rapid progression, or proximity to the deep system [^ed657477]. Recurrence is uncommon, but patients with cancer or persistent catheters have higher risk [^e59a0f36]; prognosis is generally favorable, though PTS can occur after deep involvement [^08b0f826].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

UESVT is **most commonly associated with intravenous catheters** (peripheral or central), with reported incidence ranging from 20% to 80% in some series [^1edb6677]. Additional risk factors include:

- **Malignancy**: Particularly active cancer and chemotherapy [^e59a0f36].
- **Thrombophilia**: Inherited or acquired hypercoagulable states [^a8224ba2].
- **Trauma or surgery**: Especially thoracic outlet procedures or repetitive upper limb activities [^753eebeb].
- **Infections**: Localized cellulitis or sepsis [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation

UESVT typically presents with the following **symptoms and signs**:

- **Pain**: Localized, often along the course of the affected vein.
- **Erythema**: Redness and warmth over the thrombosed vein.
- **Induration**: A firm, tender, palpable cord.
- **Edema**: Mild swelling of the affected limb.
- **Systemic symptoms**: Rare, but fever may occur in infectious cases [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Accurate diagnosis of UESVT requires **clinical assessment combined with imaging**:

- **Duplex ultrasound**: Gold standard to confirm SVT, assess thrombus extent, and exclude DVT or PE [^a52f3a80].
- **D-dimer**: Limited utility; may be elevated but nonspecific [^c19bc4e1].
- **Venography**: Reserved for inconclusive cases or when ultrasound is unavailable [^a52f3a80].

---

## Complications

Although traditionally considered benign, UESVT can lead to **significant complications**:

- **Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)**: Occurs in 6–44% of cases [^42b8d334].
- **Pulmonary embolism (PE)**: Reported in 2–13% of cases [^42b8d334].
- **Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS)**: Less common than in lower extremities but can occur, especially with deep vein involvement [^08b0f826].
- **Infection**: Suppurative thrombophlebitis or catheter-related bloodstream infection [^aec83b50].

---

## Management strategies

Management of UESVT is **individualized** based on thrombus extent, progression, and patient risk factors:

| **Management approach** | **Indications** | **Recommended interventions** |
|-|-|-|
| Conservative management | - Short segment (< 5 cm) <br/> - Non-progressive <br/> - No DVT/PE | - NSAIDs <br/> - Compression therapy <br/> - Warm compresses <br/> - Elevation [^c6a734ad] |
| Anticoagulation | - Extensive thrombus (> 5 cm) <br/> - Rapid progression <br/> - Proximity to deep veins <br/> - High-risk patients (cancer, thrombophilia) | - Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) <br/> - Fondaparinux <br/> - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for 4–6 weeks [^c6a734ad] [^ed657477] |
| Thrombectomy or ligation | - Severe symptoms <br/> - Failure of medical therapy <br/> - High-risk patients | Surgical intervention is rarely indicated [^notfound] |

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

UESVT generally has a **favorable prognosis**, with low recurrence rates and rare progression to DVT or PE when appropriately managed [^e59a0f36]. Recurrence is more likely in patients with cancer, persistent catheters, or underlying thrombophilia [^e59a0f36].

---

## Preventive measures

Preventive strategies focus on **catheter care** and risk-factor modification:

- **Catheter hygiene**: Strict aseptic technique during insertion and maintenance [^notfound].
- **Catheter selection**: Use the smallest effective diameter and minimize dwell time [^1edb6677].
- **Patient education**: Recognize early signs of thrombophlebitis and seek prompt care [^notfound].
- **Prophylactic anticoagulation**: Consider in high-risk patients (e.g. cancer, thrombophilia) [^notfound].

---

Upper limb superficial vein thrombosis is a **common, often catheter-related** condition that can lead to significant complications. Accurate diagnosis with ultrasound and individualized management — conservative care for most, anticoagulation for high-risk features — yield excellent outcomes. Prevention through meticulous catheter care and risk-factor control is essential.

### Treatment for superficial infusion thrombophlebitis of the upper extremity [^aec83b50]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Although superficial thrombophlebitis of the upper extremity represents a frequent complication of intravenous catheters inserted into the peripheral veins of the forearm or hand, no consensus exists on the optimal management of this condition in clinical practice.

Objectives

To summarise the evidence from randomised clinical trials (RCTs) concerning the efficacy and safety of (topical, oral or parenteral) medical therapy of superficial thrombophlebitis of the upper extremity.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched April 2015) and the Cochrane Register of Studies (2015, Issue 3). Clinical trials registries were searched up to April 2015.

Selection Criteria

RCTs comparing any (topical, oral or parenteral) medical treatment to no intervention or placebo, or comparing two different medical interventions (e.g. a different variant scheme or regimen of the same intervention or a different pharmacological type of treatment).

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data on methodological quality, patient characteristics, interventions and outcomes, including improvement of signs and symptoms as the primary effectiveness outcome, and number of participants experiencing side effects of the study treatments as the primary safety outcome.

Main Results

We identified 13 studies (917 participants). The evaluated treatment modalities consisted of a topical treatment (11 studies), an oral treatment (2 studies) and a parenteral treatment (2 studies). Seven studies used a placebo or no intervention control group, whereas all others also or solely compared active treatment groups. No study evaluated the effects of ice or the application of cold or hot bandages. Overall, the risk of bias in individual trials was moderate to high, although poor reporting hampered a full appreciation of the risk in most studies. The overall quality of the evidence for each of the outcomes varied from low to moderate mainly due to risk of bias and imprecision, with only single trials contributing to most comparisons. Data on primary outcomes improvement of signs and symptoms and side effects attributed to the study treatment could not be statistically pooled because of the between-study differences in comparisons, outcomes and type of instruments to measure outcomes. An array of topical treatments, such as heparinoid or diclofenac gels, improved pain compared to placebo or no intervention. Compared to placebo, oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduced signs and symptoms intensity. Safety issues were reported sparsely and were not available for some interventions, such as notoginseny creams, parenteral low-molecular-weight heparin or defibrotide. Although several trials reported on adverse events with topical heparinoid creams, Essaven gel or phlebolan versus control, the trials were underpowered to adequately measure any differences between treatment modalities. Where reported, adverse events with topical treatments consisted mainly of local allergic reactions. Only one study of 15 participants assessed thrombus extension and symptomatic venous thromboembolism with either oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or low-molecular-weight heparin, and it reported no cases of either. No study reported on the development of suppurative phlebitis, catheter-related bloodstream infections or quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence about the treatment of acute infusion superficial thrombophlebitis is limited and of low quality. Data appear too preliminary to assess the effectiveness and safety of topical treatments, systemic anticoagulation or oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

### Ultrasound imaging of superficial venous thrombosis in the upper and lower extremities: closing the gap between clinical management guidelines and ultrasound practice parameters [^53c8d7d9]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Superficial venous thrombosis (SVT) of the upper and lower extremities has long been considered a relatively benign condition. But in recent years, the literature has suggested a benefit to anticoagulation in patients with certain thrombus characteristics (size, location, and distance to deep venous system) resulting in updates to clinical guidelines for the treatment of lower extremity SVT. Despite these now well-established guidelines, there remains a paucity of guidance from national and international societies regarding the imaging of superficial veins when evaluating for venous thrombosis. We recommend potential strategies to close this gap.

Unlabelled

Essentials Few data exist on outcome of upper extremity deep and superficial vein thrombosis (UEDVT and UESVT). We followed 102 and 55 patients with UEDVT or UESVT, respectively, for a median of 3.5 years. Risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism was low in both diseases, and the mortality high. Postthrombotic symptoms were infrequent and cancer patients had a higher risk of recurrent VTE.

Summary

Background There is scant information on the optimal management and clinical outcome of deep and superficial vein thrombosis of the upper extremity (UEDVT and UESVT). Objectives To explore treatment strategies and the incidence of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), mortality, postthrombotic symptoms, and bleeding in patients with UEDVT and UESVT and to assess the prognosis of cancer patients with UEDVT. Patients/methods Follow-up of patients with UEDVT or UESVT, who were enrolled previously in a diagnostic management study. Results We followed 102 and 55 patients with UEDVT and UESVT, respectively, both for a median of 3.5 years. Anticoagulant treatment was started in 100 patients with UEDVT (98%) and in 40 (73%) with UESVT. Nine patients with UEDVT (9%) developed recurrent VTE, 26 (26%) died, 6 (8%) of 72 patients had moderate postthrombotic symptoms, and 5 (5%) experienced major bleeding. One patient with UESVT had a recurrent VTE, 18 (33%) died, none had moderate postthrombotic symptoms, and none had major bleeding. Of the cancer patients with UEDVT, 18% had recurrent VTE vs. 7.5% in non-cancer patients (adjusted hazard ratio 2.2, 95%CI 0.6–8.2). The survival rate was 50% in cancer patients with UEDVT vs. 60% in those without (adjusted HR 0.8, 95%CI 0.4–1.4). Conclusions The risk of recurrent VTE was low in patients with UEDVT, and negligible for UESVT. Mortality was high for both diseases. Postthrombotic symptoms were infrequent and mild. Anticoagulant therapy of UEDVT carried a substantial risk of major bleeding. Cancer patients had a significant risk of recurrent VTE.

### Management of superficial vein thrombosis [^5338cd81]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

Superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) is less well studied than deep vein thrombosis (DVT), because it has been considered to be a minor, self-limiting disease that is easily diagnosed on clinical grounds and that requires only symptomatic relief. The most frequently involved sites of the superficial vein system are the lower limbs, especially the saphenous veins, mostly in relation to varicosities. Lower-limb SVT shares the same risk factors as DVT; it can propagate into the deep veins, and have a complicated course with pulmonary embolism. Clinical diagnosis may not be accurate, and ultrasonography is currently indicated for both confirmation and evaluation of SVT extension. Treatment aims are symptom relief and prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in relation to the thrombotic burden. SVT of the long saphenous vein within 3 cm of the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) is considered to be equivalent to a DVT, and thus deserving of therapeutic anticoagulation. Less severe forms of lower-limb SVT not involving the SFJ have been included in randomized clinical trials of surgery, compression hosiery, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, unfractionated heparin, and low molecular weight heparins, with inconclusive results. The largest randomized clinical trial available, on 3004 patients with lower-limb SVT not involving the SFJ, showed that fondaparinux 2.5 mg once daily for 6 weeks is more effective than placebo in reducing the risk of the composite of death from any cause and symptomatic VTE (0.9% versus 5.9%). Further studies are needed to define the optimal management strategies for SVT of the lower limbs and other sites, such as the upper limbs.

### Treatment for superficial thrombophlebitis of the leg [^381d1f92]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal treatment of superficial thrombophlebitis (ST) of the legs remains poorly defined. While improving or relieving the local painful symptoms, treatment should aim at preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE), which might complicate the natural history of ST. This is the third update of a review first published in 2007.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of topical, medical, and surgical treatments for ST of the leg in improving local symptoms and decreasing thromboembolic complications.

Search Methods

For this update, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register (March 2017), CENTRAL (2017, Issue 2), and trials registries (March 2017). We handsearched the reference lists of relevant papers and conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating topical, medical, and surgical treatments for ST of the legs that included people with a clinical diagnosis of ST of the legs or objective diagnosis of a thrombus in a superficial vein.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors assessed the trials for inclusion in the review, extracted the data, and assessed the quality of the studies. Data were independently extracted from the included studies and any disagreements resolved by consensus. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We identified three additional trials (613 participants), therefore this update considered 33 studies involving 7296 people with ST of the legs. Treatment included fondaparinux; rivaroxaban; low molecular weight heparin (LMWH); unfractionated heparin (UFH); non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); compression stockings; and topical, intramuscular, or intravenous treatment to surgical interventions such as thrombectomy or ligation. Only a minority of trials compared treatment with placebo rather than an alternative treatment and many studies were small and of poor quality. Pooling of the data was possible for few outcomes, and none were part of a placebo-controlled trial. In one large, placebo-controlled RCT of 3002 participants, subcutaneous fondaparinux was associated with a significant reduction in symptomatic VTE (risk ratio (RR) 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.50; moderate-quality evidence), ST extension (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.22; moderate-quality evidence), and ST recurrence (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.54; moderate-quality evidence) relative to placebo. Major bleeding was infrequent in both groups with very wide CIs around risk estimate (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.86; moderate-quality evidence). In one RCT on 472 high-risk participants with ST, fondaparinux was associated with a non-significant reduction of symptomatic VTE compared to rivaroxaban 10 mg (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.03 to 3.18; low-quality evidence). There were no major bleeding events in either group (low-quality evidence). In another placebo-controlled trial, both prophylactic and therapeutic doses of LMWH (prophylactic: RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.74; therapeutic: RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.77) and NSAIDs (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.78) reduced the extension (low-quality evidence) and recurrence of ST (low-quality evidence) in comparison to placebo, with no significant effects on symptomatic VTE (low-quality evidence) or major bleeding (low-quality evidence). Overall, topical treatments improved local symptoms compared with placebo, but no data were provided on the effects on VTE and ST extension. Surgical treatment combined with elastic stockings was associated with a lower VTE rate and ST progression compared with elastic stockings alone. However, the majority of studies that compared different oral treatments, topical treatments, or surgery did not report VTE, ST progression, adverse events, or treatment adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

Prophylactic dose fondaparinux given for 45 days appears to be a valid therapeutic option for ST of the legs for most people. The evidence on topical treatment or surgery is too limited and does not inform clinical practice about the effects of these treatments in terms of VTE. Further research is needed to assess the role of rivaroxaban and other direct oral factor-X or thrombin inhibitors, LMWH, and NSAIDs; the optimal doses and duration of treatment in people at various risk of recurrence; and whether a combination therapy may be more effective than single treatment. Adequately designed and conducted studies are required to clarify the role of topical and surgical treatments.

### How I treat rare venous thromboses [^d208c92b]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism may involve venous sites other than the lower limbs, such as cerebral, splanchnic, and upper limb veins. Although uncommon, these thromboses may be clinically severe and challenging for caregivers. In this review, the main pathogenic, clinical, and therapeutic features of thromboses in rare venous sites are discussed. Even though there was a lot of recent progress in understanding the mechanistic role of inherited and acquired thrombophilia and of the interactions between different risk factors, the optimal management of these patients is still unsettled, being currently based on the consensus of experts due to the lack of randomized trials. The implementation of large interdisciplinary registries is a necessary weapon to optimize the treatment of rare venous diseases.

### Peripheral vein thrombophlebitis in the upper extremity: a systematic review of a frequent and important problem [^1edb6677]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The acceptable incidence of thrombophlebitis following intravenous cannulation is 5%, as recommended by the Intravenous Nurses Society guidelines, but publications have reported startling figures of 20% to 80%. Given the frequency of intravenous lines, this presents a potential clinical problem. We aimed to determine the predisposing patient, catheter, and health care-related factors of peripheral vein thrombophlebitis in the upper extremity.

Methods

In this systematic review, we used a comprehensive search strategy to identify risk factors of thrombophlebitis from inception to May 20, 2019. Studies reporting risk factors of peripheral vein thrombophlebitis of adult patients admitted to the hospital and receiving an intravenous cannulation were included. The Quality of Prognostic Studies tool was used in the assessment for risk of bias to determine the study quality.

Results

Of the 6910 studies initially identified, 25 were eligible for inclusion. Qualitative syntheses revealed that patient-related factors that confer a higher risk included intercurrent illness, immunocompromised state, comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, malignancy, previous thrombophlebitis, burns, and higher hemoglobin levels. Catheter-related risk factors included catheter size, duration, and site of insertion. Intravenous antibiotics and potassium chloride predisposed to thrombophlebitis. Cannulation by an intravenous therapy team and more nursing care were associated with a decreased risk. A P-value < .5 was considered to be statistically significant.

Conclusion

Recognition of the predisposing factors would allow for targeted strategies to aid in the prevention of this iatrogenic infection, which may include closer monitoring of patients who are identified to be vulnerable. Based on this systematic review, we developed an algorithm to guide clinical management. Further research is warranted to validate this algorithm.

### Diagnosis and management of deep vein thrombosis of the upper extremity: a review [^8e9452c7]. European Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Deep vein thrombosis of the upper extremity is an increasing clinical problem due to the use of long-term indwelling catheters for chemotherapy or long-term feeding. The clinical diagnosis is difficult to make, and various imaging modalities have been used for this purpose. The use of (interventional) radiological procedures has been advancing in recent years. This review describes the clinical background, the imaging modalities that may be employed, treatment options and outcome of patients with upper extremity thrombosis.

### Upper-extremity deep venous thrombosis: a review [^0b021ff5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Upper-extremity deep venous thrombosis is less common than lower-extremity deep venous thrombosis. However, upper-extremity deep venous thrombosis is associated with similar adverse consequences and is becoming more common in patients with complex medical conditions requiring central venous catheters or wires. Although guidelines suggest that this disorder be managed using approaches similar to those for lower-extremity deep venous thrombosis, studies are refining the prognosis and management of upper-extremity deep venous thrombosis. Physicians should be familiar with the diagnostic and treatment considerations for this disease. This review will differentiate between primary and secondary upper-extremity deep venous thromboses; assess the risk factors and clinical sequelae associated with upper-extremity deep venous thrombosis, comparing these with lower-extremity deep venous thrombosis; and describe an approach to treatment and prevention of secondary upper-extremity deep venous thrombosis based on clinical evidence.

### Upper extremity deep venous thrombosis: interventional management [^9ee3f283]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Upper extremity deep venous thrombosis, previously thought to be a relatively innocuous disorder in comparison to lower extremity deep venous thrombosis, has recently begun to receive the attention it merits. Its optimal management remains controversial despite the development of several new techniques and devices which allow more rapid removal of thrombus and treatment of underlying venous stenotic disease. The following article provides a framework to discuss its treatment, with the emphasis on endovascular management.

### Management of catheter-associated upper extremity deep venous thrombosis [^d382ffa2]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Central venous catheters or peripherally inserted central catheters are major risk factors for upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (UEDVT). The body and quality of literature evaluating catheter-associated (CA) UEDVT have increased, yet strong evidence on screening, diagnosis, prevention, and optimal treatment is limited. We herein review the current evidence of CA UEDVT that can be applied clinically. Principally, we review the anatomy and definition of CA UEDVT, identification of risk factors, utility of duplex ultrasound as the preferred diagnostic modality, preventive strategies, and an algorithm for management of CA UEDVT.

### Current perspective of venous thrombosis in the upper extremity [^0b872688]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2008). Low credibility.

Venous thrombosis of the upper extremity is a rare disease. Therefore, not as much is known about risk factors, treatment and the risk of recurrence as for venous thrombosis of the leg. Only central venous catheters and strenuous exercise are commonly known risk factors for an upper extremity venous thrombosis. In this review an overview of the different risk factors, possible treatments and the complications for patients with a venous thrombosis of the upper extremity is given.

ASH 2018 venous thromboembolism (VTE) diagnosis — prioritized clinical questions focus on optimal diagnostic strategies for suspected pulmonary embolism (PE), lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), recurrent events, and upper extremity DVT across specified clinical probabilities. For PE, questions address low, intermediate, and high clinical probability first‑episode PE and assessment of suspected recurrent PE in patients with a prior history of PE. For lower extremity DVT, questions address low, intermediate, and high clinical probability first‑episode DVT and suspected recurrent DVT in patients with a prior history of DVT. For upper extremity DVT, questions address evaluation when the clinical probability is unlikely or likely.

### Whole-arm ultrasound in upper-extremity deep venous thrombosis… [^a52f3a80]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

Of the 483 patients who underwent whole-arm ultrasonography for suspected upper-extremity deep venous thrombosis, 319 patients had a normal result, of whom 5 were lost to follow-up. Twenty-one patients had an inconclusive test, which was repeated after 5 to 7 days, results of which revealed upper-extremity superficial venous thrombosis in 1 patient and DVT in 2 patients. A prospective management study was conducted from January 1, 2011, through December 31, 2013, in the Angiology and Blood Coagulation Unit, University Hospital, Bologna, Italy, a tertiary care teaching hospital, in outpatients referred by general practice physicians to the vascular emergency department for suspected symptomatic DVT or superficial venous thrombosis of the upper extremities.

Ultrasonography was performed according to the methods of Chin et al2: radial, ulnar, and brachial veins were scanned transversally, whereas axillary, subclavian, and internal jugular veins were scanned both transversally and longitudinally. The diagnostic criteria were the presence of intraluminal thrombus combined with a lack of vein compression and/or with an abnormal flow pattern in the segment of the vein distal to the thrombosis. Superficial venous thrombosis was diagnosed as previously described. 3 If technical problems or anatomical barriers hampered visualization, findings from the ultrasonographic screening were considered indeterminate and it was repeated after 5 to 7 days. The Table shows characteristics of the 483 study participants. The Figure shows the study flowchart. Findings from the ultrasonographic screening at enrollment were normal in 319 patients and inconclusive in 21, who repeated the test after 5 to 7 days.

For those who repeated the test, findings from the ultrasonographic screening showed SVT in 1 patient and DVT in 2 patients. Our study shows that, similar to that of the lower extremities, a completely normal finding on ultrasonography of the upper extremity can safely exclude DVT. 4 Venography is the criterion standard for diagnosis of UE-DVT, 5 but it has been largely replaced by ultrasonography in clinical practice.

### Epidemiology of antiphospholipid syndrome: macro-and microvascular manifestations [^f1897216]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Macrovascular manifestations in APS

Venous and/or arterial thrombosis is the hallmark of the presentation of APS. Any vessel and/or organ system can be affected either as single or multiple events, occurring simultaneously or sequentially. The wide spectrum of APS thrombotic manifestations in APS echoes the great variability in the type of thrombosis (arterial/venous), location and vessel size (macro- and microvascular).

Venous thrombosis

Venous thrombosis, either as initial or recurrent events, is more prevalent than arterial thrombosis, with estimates ranging from ∼40% to 50% to > 60% of patients. The demographic characteristics (age, sex and race/ethnicity), disease duration, co-existence of risk factors for venous thrombosis (trauma, surgery, immobilization, oestrogen use or obesity) and the access to a health care system, modulate how APS manifests worldwide.

Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is the most frequent venous thrombosis manifestation in APS, affecting 30–40% of patients (Table 2). The deep veins of the lower limbs are the most common sites of thrombosis, affecting more than one-third of patients in most regional and international cohorts. The upper limbs can also be affected, although with a much lower prevalence (∼1% to 3%). Less commonly (< 1%), other sites of venous thrombosis include subclavian, jugular and superior and/or inferior vena cava. DVT is arguably very unlike to be life-threatening, nevertheless, post-thrombotic syndrome, encompassing venous vascular insufficiency to chronic ulcers and cutaneous trophic lesions, can develop in > 40% of thrombotic APS patients and has a significant impact on health-related quality of life. Superficial thrombophlebitis, although not included in the APS classification criteria, may occur in up to 10% of patients.

### Preferred management of primary deep arm vein thrombosis [^fbb6886f]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Given its rarity, the management of primary upper extremity deep vein thrombosis is controversial. Although anticoagulation alone is commonly advocated for its treatment, it is unclear if this will reduce the risk of developing post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). The aim of this "Evidence Driven" Clinical Scenario is to evaluate whether more aggressive treatments (including catheter directed thrombolysis or surgery) might help reduce the risk of PTS or recurrent venous thromboembolism in patients with primary upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Methods

An electronic systematic review of Ovid MEDLINE and Embase was conducted. Randomised controlled trials and observational studies were eligible. The primary outcome was PTS.

Results

The initial search identified 146 articles, and 36 more were identified during a secondary search. In total, 25 studies, reporting the outcome of 1271 patients, were included. None of the studies included was a randomised controlled trial and the large majority of studies were retrospective cohorts. The use of anticoagulation alone was associated with a significant risk of PTS. In patients treated with surgery with or without thrombolysis the incidence of PTS was significantly reduced.

Conclusion

Current evidence, albeit with some methodological limitations, suggests that anticoagulation may not be sufficient to prevent PTS in patients with primary upper extremity DVT and that surgery with or without thrombolysis to repair the anatomical defects is needed.

### Post-thrombotic syndrome after upper extremity deep vein thrombosis: an international Delphi consensus study [^c345c45c]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Primary deep vein thrombosis of the upper extremity (UEDVT) is a rare condition with an estimated incidence of 1–3 per 100 000 people per year. Contrary to the more common secondary upper extremity thrombosis, in primary UEDVT there is no clear provoking factor for thrombosis such as intravenous catheters or pacemaker wires. Hence, the treatment for primary UEDVT is more complex compared to secondary UEDVT. Moreover, complications after primary UEDVT are common and up to 60% of patients can develop chronic symptoms in the upper extremity, commonly attributed to the post‐thrombotic syndrome (UE‐PTS). PTS refers to a set of signs and symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency that can occur after deep vein thrombosis. The UE‐PTS related morbidity is significant and has a negative impact on patients' quality of life (QoL). Therefore, prevention of UE‐PTS is an important goal in both conservative and invasive treatment strategies for UEDVT. In studies on UEDVT treatment, UE‐PTS free survival has become a critical outcome parameter, but clinical tools to objectify and measure PTS in the upper extremity are still lacking. Currently a wide variation of outcome measures for symptom‐free survival and/or UE‐PTS after treatment of UEDVT are being used, making a comparison of studies unfeasible.

### Necrotizing fasciitis: literature review of contemporary strategies for diagnosing and management with three case reports: torso, abdominal wall, upper and lower limbs [^47918d1e]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Incidence and classification

Necrotizing fasciitis, the most complicated and life threatening NSTI, has a progressive and rapidly advancing clinical course. Although occurring in all age groups, NF is slightly more common in older age groups (> 50 years of age). The infection usually affects the deep fascial plane, with secondary necrosis of subcutaneous tissue and skin caused by the thrombosis of the subcutaneous and perforators vessels. The incidence of NF has been reported to be 0.40 cases per 100 000 adults. There is a male to female ratio of 3:1 in all cases of NSTI, which relates predominately to the incidence of Fournier's gangrene of the perineum. The terminology used for infections of skin and skin structures is often confusing. Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are best classified according to the anatomical site of infection, depth of infection, microbial source of infection, or by severity (minor superficial lesion to invasive, fulminant and even lethal infections) (Table 2.). The Infection Disease Society of America made practical classification of SSTIs into three groups: superficial, uncomplicated infection (includes impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis), necrotizing infection; infections associated with bites and animal contact; surgical site infections and infections in the immunocompromised host. The recent clinical classification distinguished four NF types: Type I (70–80%, polymicrobial/synergistic), type II (20% of cases; usually monomicrobial), type III (gram-negative monomicrobial, including marine-related organisms) and type IV (fungal). Although NF is rare, its mortality rate is high, ranging from 6% to 76%, although it is much lower in recent studies (approximately 26%). Establishing the diagnosis can be challenging. Every physician must know the answers to four main questions: "What is the clinical course of NSTIs, especially of NF?", "Which types of organisms are responsible for the infection?", "What is the depth of the infection?", and "Is NF a life or limb threatening disease?". The first answer ensures early diagnosis of NSTI/NF, the second determines the empirical spectrum of antimicrobial therapy, and the last two answers point out the timing and the extent of surgical intervention.

### The post-thrombotic syndrome after upper extremity deep venous thrombosis in adults: a systematic review [^54d9bb59]. Thrombosis Research (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Post-thrombotic syndrome is a chronic, potentially debilitating complication of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremity. Comparatively little is known about post-thrombotic syndrome after upper extremity DVT (UEDVT).

Objective

To perform a systematic review of clinical studies that have examined the incidence, clinical features, risk factors and management of post-thrombotic syndrome after UEDVT.

Methods

Using combinations of keywords venous thrombosis, postphlebitic syndrome, thrombophlebitis, arm swelling, post-thrombotic syndrome, UEDVT, Paget-Schroetter syndrome, thoracic outlet syndrome, axillary vein, subclavian vein, and central venous catheter, the MEDLINE database was searched for English language articles published between January 1967 and December 2004. Retrieval and review of articles were restricted to clinical studies in humans that described long-term outcomes after objectively confirmed UEDVT.

Results

Seven studies were reviewed. The frequency of PTS after UEDVT ranges from 7–46% (weighted mean 15%). Residual thrombosis and axillosubclavian vein thrombosis appear to be associated with an increased risk of PTS, whereas catheter-associated UEDVT may be associated with a decreased risk. There is currently no validated, standardized scale to assess upper extremity PTS, and little consensus regarding the optimal management of this condition. Quality of life is impaired in patients with upper extremity PTS, especially after DVT of the dominant arm.

Conclusions

PTS is a frequent complication of UEDVT, yet little is known regarding risk factors and optimal management. A standardized means of diagnosis would help to establish better management protocols. The impact of upper extremity PTS on quality of life should be further quantified.

### The 2023 Society for Vascular Surgery, American Venous Forum, and American Vein and Lymphatic Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of varicose veins of the lower extremities. part II: endorsed by the Society of Interventional Radiology and the Society for Vascular Medicine [^42b8d334]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). High credibility.

Superficial venous thrombophlebitis (SVT) rationale and evidence — Studies show that SVT may progress to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in 6% to 44% of patients; 20% to 33% may have asymptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE); and 2% to 13% may have symptomatic PE, and superficial venous thrombosis involving the saphenous trunk has the greatest association with VTE. Although the majority of SVT occurs in varicose veins, SVT in nonvaricose veins confers greater morbidity. These recommendations are supported by two recent systematic reviews; the 2018 Cochrane review included 35 studies involving 7296 patients with SVT of the legs, and most studies excluded patients with SVT that was within 3 cm of the SFJ. The recommendations are primarily based on one large placebo controlled RCT of 3002 participants who received fondaparinux and demonstrated a significant reduction in symptomatic VTE, SVT extension, and SVT recurrence in comparison with placebo.

5 CONCLUSION

We achieved consensus on what the most important clinical signs and symptoms of UE‐PTS are and what aspects a clinical scoring method for diagnosing and measuring the severity of UE‐PTS should encompass. Follow‐up studies are required to test the clinical value of the proposed scoring method and to determine which functional disability score is most suitable for implementation in a future UE‐PTS score, followed by a validation study in a large patient cohort.

### Recent findings in the epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of superficial-vein thrombosis [^bb3331f5]. Thrombosis Research (2011). Low credibility.

Recent data on lower-limb superficial-vein thrombosis (SVT) may substantially impact its clinical management. Thus, the clear confirmation that SVT is closely linked to deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) highlights the potential severity of the disease. DVT or PE are diagnosed in 20–30% of SVT patients. Moreover, clinically relevant symptomatic thromboembolic events complicate isolated SVT (without concomitant DVT or PE at diagnosis) in 4–8% of patients. For the first time, an anticoagulant treatment, once-daily 2.5 mg fondaparinux for 45 days, was demonstrated to be effective and safe for preventing these symptomatic thromboembolic events in patients with lower-limb isolated SVT in the randomized placebo-controlled CALISTO study. Based on these recent findings, new recommendations on the management of SVT patients, including complete ultrasonography examination of the legs, and in patients with isolated SVT, prescription of once-daily 2.5 mg fondaparinux subcutaneously for 45 days on top of symptomatic treatments, may be proposed.

### Superficial vein thrombosis: a current approach to management [^c6a734ad]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

Superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) was considered to be a benign and self-limiting condition. However, it is now appreciated that a significant proportion of those presenting with SVT will have concomitant deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, or are at significant risk of developing deep venous thromboembolism. Potential therapeutic options include topical preparations, compression therapy (stockings, bandages), medication such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or anticoagulants (therapeutic or prophylactic doses) and surgery, ligation or stripping, of superficial veins. The treatment of choice is therapeutic/intermediate dose low molecular weight heparin or prophylactic dose fondaparinux administered for 4–6 weeks. The cost-effectiveness of treatment is a concern and more targeted therapy is required.

### Venous protocols, techniques, and interpretations of the upper and lower extremities [^65327f74]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are common problems and frequently included in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting to the emergency department and in the acute care setting. Clinical signs and symptoms of these entities are nonspecific and it is important to perform objective testing to confirm the diagnosis and initiate proper therapy. Compression ultrasonography is the diagnostic procedure of choice for the investigation of patients with suspected deep venous thrombosis. This article reviews the clinical indications, diagnostic techniques, and interpretation of compression ultrasound to assess deep venous thrombosis in the upper and lower extremities and to evaluate the role of compression ultrasonography in the assessment of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism.

### Spontaneous acute superficial vein thrombosis of the legs: do we really need to treat? [^3867bbe4]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

Spontaneous acute superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) of the leg is now generally recognized as an integral component of venous thromboembolic disease with potentially severe consequences. However, the relatively low grades of some current international recommendations and uncertainty regarding the cost-effectiveness of available therapies may prompt questioning of the real need to treat patients with SVT and explain the persisting heterogeneity of their management in practise. Yet several studies have consistently shown high rates of thromboembolic complications associated with SVT, whether at first presentation or during follow-up. The CALISTO trial established for the first time the clinical benefit of a well-defined anticoagulant regimen for the prevention of serious thromboembolic complications in SVT patients, and we believe that patients such as those included in this trial should receive this regimen as tested. However, several areas of uncertainty remain for categories of SVT patients not evaluated in CALISTO.

### Safety and feasibility of a diagnostic algorithm combining clinical probability, D-dimer testing, and ultrasonography for suspected upper extremity deep venous thrombosis: a prospective management study [^87bb89ea]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Although well-established for suspected lower limb deep venous thrombosis, an algorithm combining a clinical decision score, d-dimer testing, and ultrasonography has not been evaluated for suspected upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (UEDVT).

Objective

To assess the safety and feasibility of a new diagnostic algorithm in patients with clinically suspected UEDVT.

Design

Diagnostic management study. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01324037) SETTING: 16 hospitals in Europe and the United States.

Patients

406 inpatients and outpatients with suspected UEDVT.

Measurements

The algorithm consisted of the sequential application of a clinical decision score, d-dimer testing, and ultrasonography. Patients were first categorized as likely or unlikely to have UEDVT; in those with an unlikely score and normal d-dimer levels, UEDVT was excluded. All other patients had (repeated) compression ultrasonography. The primary outcome was the 3-month incidence of symptomatic UEDVT and pulmonary embolism in patients with a normal diagnostic work-up.

Results

The algorithm was feasible and completed in 390 of the 406 patients (96%). In 87 patients (21%), an unlikely score combined with normal d-dimer levels excluded UEDVT. Superficial venous thrombosis and UEDVT were diagnosed in 54 (13%) and 103 (25%) patients, respectively. All 249 patients with a normal diagnostic work-up, including those with protocol violations (n = 16), were followed for 3 months. One patient developed UEDVT during follow-up, for an overall failure rate of 0.4% (95% CI, 0.0% to 2.2%).

Limitations

This study was not powered to show the safety of the substrategies. d-Dimer testing was done locally.

Conclusion

The combination of a clinical decision score, d-dimer testing, and ultrasonography can safely and effectively exclude UEDVT. If confirmed by other studies, this algorithm has potential as a standard approach to suspected UEDVT.

Primary Funding Source

None.

### Management strategy for compartment syndrome of the upper extremity arising during anticoagulation or thrombolytic therapy: an increasingly common surgical dilemma [^fc70d227]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Compartment syndrome is a documented and potentially lethal complication of thrombolytic therapy. With the increasing use of catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy, a high index of suspicion for the potential occurrence of this surgical emergency must be maintained. Errors of omission in the diagnosis of compartment syndrome, even for a few hours, may lead rapidly to limb loss, renal failure, and possibly death. The authors present a case of compartment syndrome arising in the forearm of a patient being treated with continuous catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy for an occluded arterial bypass graft associated with an ischemic lower extremity. Specific to this presentation is their management of compartment syndrome during thrombolytic therapy as well as previously unreported use of a homograft (cadaveric skin) to control ongoing blood loss from a fasciotomy site in this fully anticoagulated patient. The authors think their management in this case may help to provide direction to others faced with a similar, increasingly common, surgical dilemma.

### Superficial vein thrombosis: risk factors, diagnosis, and treatment [^a8224ba2]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) risk factors are close to those of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Diagnosis is made in a clinical setting but ultrasonography is useful to eliminate concomitant deep vein thrombosis (DVT). For SVT of the lower limbs, which is the main location, varicose veins represent the principal cause but underlying conditions (e.g.: autoimmune diseases, malignancy or thrombophilia) must be sought in idiopathic, migrant or recurrent SVT and in the absence of varicose veins. Concomitant DVT and pulmonary embolism can occur in approximately 15% and 5% respectively. Historical treatments consist of anti-inflammatory agents plus elastic stockings and, in case of varicose veins, thrombectomy and stripping. Other treatments (anticoagulants, vein ligation) were assessed to limit the VTE risk. A one-month prophylactic dose of low molecular weight heparin plus elastic stockings could be the appropriate strategy in most cases. Other studies are needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn.

### Methodology for the American Society of Hematology VTE guidelines: current best practice, innovations, and experiences [^9677e7ad]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

Proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT) health-outcome descriptors — upper leg severe, moderate, and mild presentations are defined across symptoms, time horizon, testing and treatment, and consequences. Severe DVT notes symptoms in the entire leg, a time horizon that will persist for months and will slowly improve, and consequences that often include long‑lasting pain and swelling, and sometimes a blood clot travelling to the lungs (a pulmonary embolism) and death; treatment may be administered in the hospital or at home and typically includes administration of blood thinners using a small tube inserted in your vein, injections or pills, with long‑lasting treatment often required. Moderate DVT will persist for months but improve over that time, and consequences may include long‑lasting pain and swelling in the leg, and rarely a blood clot travelling to the lungs (a pulmonary embolism) and death. Mild DVT will persist for weeks but improve over that time, and consequences rarely include long‑lasting pain and swelling in the leg, and very rarely a blood clot travelling to the lungs (a pulmonary embolism) and death.

Study limitations

These results should be interpreted with caution because this study has some limitations. The quality of the studies is poor, with no randomized controlled trials. Most studies are cohort studies with heterogeneous follow-up methods. The large number of different clinical situations favors heterogeneity in therapeutic management with various types and durations of anticoagulation. In addition, we found great variability in the incidence of CVC removal. Fifteen studies appeared to be the most informative because of their prospective method, quality of the selection and analyses, or their large patient numbers. The higher recurrence rate for patients with anticoagulation therapy for > 3 months is most likely related to a bias secondary to the presence of persistent thrombosis recurrence risk factors that caused anticoagulation to be maintained. Concerning follow-up, most of the studies had ≥ 3 months of follow-up; however, several studies did not specify the follow-up duration and/or patients lost to follow-up, limiting their validity. For bleeding, several studies did not report events using the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis criteria. Moreover, no definition of PTS in the upper limb has been established, which limits comparisons. Regarding the meta-analysis, pooled estimates from all three outcomes were associated with the presence of relatively high statistical heterogeneity. The results from the subgroup analyses seemed to suggest such heterogeneity was due to cancer and/or CVC status. An assessment of the outliers' effect was explored and led to close estimates compared with the pooled effects from the principal analysis, with lower heterogeneity. Also, information for the subgroups was not always available and led to the exclusion of studies owing to the lack of evidence. For UEVT, because of the lack of randomized studies, the difference in the outcomes between different treatment modalities could not be directly compared because the difference could have resulted from a confounding bias. Studies using one treatment might have had patients with different characteristic than studies using different treatment strategies. These factors include CVC removal and anticoagulation duration. Thus, it was difficult to compare studies and to compare data within studies, and caution should prevail when interpreting these results.

Methods

The primary objective of this systematic review was to estimate the rate of VTE development during mid-term follow-up in patients with lower limb SVT without DVT and PE who received any systemic anticoagulation according to the treatment duration. Following the Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) rule, the main question was: "How does the duration of anticoagulation therapy impact the risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with superficial vein thrombosis of lower limbs within mid-term follow-up?" The systematic review protocol, including all planned analyses, was registered a priori through PROSPERO, an international database of prospectively registered systematic reviews in health and social care (CRD42021271486).

### Treatment of upper limb deep vein thrombosis with low molecular weight heparin [^3340decf]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2003). Low credibility.

Upper limb deep vein thrombosis has been an under-recognized disease; however, physicians' awareness of it as a cause of arm pain and edema is increasing. Previously thought of as benign, upper limb deep vein thrombosis has been shown in recent studies to pose a significant risk for pulmonary embolus and death. The need for treatment is now recognized; however, effective treatments for upper limb deep vein thrombosis have not been fully defined. Anticoagulation with oral agents is known to be successful in preventing complications and recurrence. This report presents the first case of upper limb deep vein thrombosis successfully treated with only low molecular weight heparin.

### Benefit of anticoagulation for the treatment of lower extremity superficial venous thrombosis [^47200504]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Superficial venous thrombosis (SVT) of the lower extremity is an acute disorder characterized by thrombosis and inflammation of superficial veins. This most commonly affects varicose veins but can also occur in patients with nonvaricose veins, who may have an underlying condition such as a malignant disease or thrombophilia. It is important to be aware that SVT confers a significant risk for the development of the more serious and debilitating condition of deep venous thrombosis and the potentially life-threatening condition of pulmonary embolism. Recognition of SVT, determination of appropriateness of therapy, and institution of timely therapy are paramount to prevention of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in properly selected patients. The objective of this evidence-based summary was to provide clinically applicable information from the current literature and guidelines regarding the best treatment options for SVT. There are no randomized trials that compare the efficacy and outcomes of newer therapies, such as the novel oral anticoagulants and endovenous ablation, with traditional therapies, such as traditional anticoagulant and surgery exclusion, in the treatment of SVT.

### Post-thrombotic syndrome after upper extremity deep vein thrombosis: an international Delphi consensus study [^ca148c95]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

To allow comparison of future randomized controlled trials (RCT) or prospective registries it is vital to have an unambiguous and reproducible outcome measure to score UE‐PTS. Furthermore, an easy‐to‐use clinical UE‐PTS score may help to raise awareness of this syndrome making an early diagnosis and treatment possible. Thus, from both a scientific and a clinical point of view, a broadly accepted outcome measure is warranted to assess UE‐PTS. Such a clinical score will need to: (1) represent a clinically relevant outcome for the patient; (2) be supported by a broad spectrum of experts in the field of PTS and VTE; and (3) be, where possible, an objective and reproducible scoring method. We aim to develop such a score through a multistep approach. The first step is to reach international consensus on what UE‐PTS entails and how we can diagnose this ill‐defined disease. The second step will be to test and fine‐tune the proposed diagnostic algorithm in a large patient cohort. The final step will be the implementation of this method in daily practice and future research.

For the first step we developed this Delphi study with the aim to reach consensus among international experts on how to best diagnose UE‐PTS, what the most important clinical signs and symptoms of UE‐PTS are, and what a future clinical scoring method for diagnosing and measuring the severity of PTS in the upper extremity should look like.

Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) — recommendation categories and implications are defined as follows: Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence (1A) states that "Benefits clearly outweigh risk and burdens, or vice versa", is supported by "RCTs without important limitations or overwhelming evidence from observational studies", and implies "Strong recommendation, can apply to most patients in most circumstances without reservation". Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence (1B) uses "RCTs with important limitations… or exceptionally strong evidence from observational studies" and implies "Strong recommendation, can apply to most patients in most circumstances without reservation". Strong recommendation, low-quality or very low-quality evidence (1C) relies on "Observational studies or case series" and implies "Strong recommendation but may change when higher quality evidence becomes available". Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence (2A) indicates "Benefits closely balanced with risks and burdens", is supported by "RCTs without important limitations or overwhelming evidence from observational studies", and implies "Weak recommendation, best action may differ depending on circumstances or patients' or societal values". Weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence (2B) uses "RCTs with important limitations… or exceptionally strong evidence from observational studies" and implies "Weak recommendation, best action may differ depending on circumstances or patients' or societal values". Weak recommendation, low-quality or very low-quality evidence (2C) notes "Uncertainty in the estimates of benefits and risk, and burden; risk, benefit, and burdens may be closely balanced", is based on "Observational studies or case series", and implies "Very weak recommendations; other alternatives may be reasonable".

### Controversies in venous thromboembolism: to treat or not to treat superficial vein thrombosis [^9af6d890]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

The management of superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) is poorly defined and remains controversial overall. SVT has long been considered a benign, self-limited disease, but recent studies show that SVT carries a nonnegligible risk for recurrence, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. Current guidelines recommend the use of low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux, but results of several surveys indicate that the majority of patients with SVT receive nonanticoagulant therapy only, which includes compression stockings or bandages, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, topical application of heparin gel, or surgical interventions. However, several recent observational and interventional studies provide better insight into the optimal treatment of patients with SVT who are at different risks for thromboembolic complications. This educational review summarizes the available evidence and aims to provide practical guidance based on a clinical decision pathway.

### Treatment of superficial venous disease of the lower leg [^f2154693]. AVLS (2013). Medium credibility.

Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework — these recommendations have been determined by the method suggested by the GRADE working group. For each guideline, the letter A, B or C marks the quality of current evidence as high, medium or low quality. The grade of recommendation of a guideline can be strong (1) or weak (2), depending on the risk and burden of a particular diagnostic test or a therapeutic procedure to the patient vs. the expected benefit. The words 'we recommend' are used for GRADE 1 — strong recommendations — if the benefits clearly outweigh risks and burdens, or vice versa; the words 'we suggest' are used for GRADE 2 — weak recommendations — when the benefits are closely balanced with risks and burdens. Where current evidence is weak or lacking, the degree of consensus of the committee reflects the grade with the quality of the recommendation adjusted accordingly.

### Prevalence of post-thrombotic syndrome in a cohort of upper extremity vein thrombosis [^08b0f826]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is one of the main complications that occurs after venous thrombosis. There are few data on the proportion of patients that will develop upper extremity PTS (UE-PTS) after upper extremity venous thrombosis (UEVT). The main objective of the study was to assess the prevalence of PTS in a UEVT cohort and to identify predictive factors of UE-PTS.

Methods

This study included patients with a history of proximal or arm UEVT, diagnosed on duplex ultrasound examination, between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2017, in a university hospital. After UEVT, each patient was evaluated by a prospective standardized recording of clinical manifestations and duplex ultrasound examination in case of upper limb symptoms. UE-PTS was defined as a modified Villalta score of 4 or higher.

Results

Ninety-two patients were included; 68 (73.9%) had deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and 24 (19.2%) arm superficial vein thrombosis. Thirteen patients had PTS (14.1%), 12 (17.6%) in the DVT group and 1 (4.2%) in the superficial vein thrombosis group. There was a history of DVT in 92.3% of the cases of PTS. PTS was more frequent in patients with strokes with limb movement reduction (P = 0.01). On multivariate Cox analysis, a history of stroke (hazard ratio, 5.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.46–20.22; P = 0.01) was predictive of UE-PTS.

Conclusions

UE-PTS occurred in 14.1% of cases after UEVT. Stroke with a decrease in limb movement was a predictor of developing PTS. Diagnostic criteria should be established for UE-PTS and prospective studies are needed to improve the description and management of UE-PTS.

### Overview of venous pathology related to repetitive vascular trauma in athletes [^753eebeb]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Athletes are generally young, high-functioning individuals. Pathology in this cohort is associated with a decrease in function and consequently has major implications on quality of life. Venous disorders can be attributed to a combination of vascular compression with a high burden of activity.

Objective

This article promotes increased awareness of these uncommon conditions specific to the athlete by summarizing pathophysiology, clinical features, investigation, and treatment protocols for use in clinical practice. Prognostic outcomes of these management regimens are also discussed, allowing for clinicians to counsel these high-functioning individuals appropriately. With the aim of providing an overview of sport-related venous pathology, a literature review was undertaken identifying articles that were independently reviewed by the authors.

Results

Lower limb venous thrombosis has been identified in young, high-functioning athletes attributed to both compression-related venous trauma, associated with repetitive movements resulting in intimal damage, and blunt trauma. The diagnosis and treatment follow the same protocols as for the general population. Of note, early ambulation is advocated, with an aim to return to premorbid (noncontact) function within 6 weeks. Athletes performing high-intensity repetitive upper limb movement, such as baseball players, are predisposed to upper limb deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Diagnosis follows the same protocols as for lower extremity DVT; however, the optimal treatment strategy remains debated. Current guidelines advocate the use of anticoagulation alone. A specific subset of primary upper limb DVT is effort thrombosis, where there is compression at the level of the thoracic outlet. Thrombolysis with first rib resection is indicated in the acute setting within 14 days. In cases of complete occlusion, surgical decompression with venous reconstruction may be required. Popliteal vein entrapment syndrome is also discussed. This entity has been identified as an overuse injury associated with popliteal vein compression. Duplex ultrasound examination is indicated as a first-line investigation, with conservative noninvasive options considered as an initial management strategy. Chronic venous insufficiency or persistent symptoms may require subsequent surgical decompression.

Conclusions

Key conditions including upper extremity and lower extremity venous thrombosis, venous aneurysms, Paget-Schroetter syndrome (effort thrombosis), and popliteal vein entrapment syndrome are discussed. Further studies evaluating long-term outcomes on morbidity for current treatment regimens in upper extremity DVT, effort thrombosis, venous thoracic outlet syndrome, and popliteal venous entrapment syndrome are required.

Male breast cancer is an uncommon disease with a low annual prevalence in Western countries. Venous thromboembolism may be associated during malignancy of the breast. We report a 70-year-old man who presented with superficial vein thrombosis of right upper limb that predicted the diagnosis of breast invasive ductal carcinoma. Key issues surrounding the diagnosis, treatment, and relationship between breast cancer and venous disorders are discussed. Breast cancer and venous thromboembolism are 2 conditions that are often correlated more than expected, and attention to the combination of these clinical presentations is required.

### D-dimer for the diagnosis of upper extremity deep and superficial venous thrombosis [^c19bc4e1]. Thrombosis Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

D-dimer role is well established in the diagnostic work-up for lower limb deep vein thrombosis (DVT), however it has not been formally tested for clinically suspected upper extremity DVT and/or superficial vein thrombosis (SVT).

Aim

To ascertain D-dimer diagnostic accuracy for upper extremity DVT and/or SVT.

Study Design

We performed a single centre management study in outpatients referred by emergency or primary care physicians for clinically suspected upper extremity DVT. All patients underwent D-dimer testing (cut-off value: ≤ 500 ng/mL), and a B-mode and color Doppler ultrasonography examination. In case of either technical problems or anatomical barriers, ultrasonography was repeated after 5–7 days. All patients were followed up for three months for the occurrence of symptomatic DVT and/or SVT and/or pulmonary embolism.

Results

We enrolled 239 patients (F: 63.6%; mean ± SD age: 58.3 ± 16.8). At the initial diagnostic work-up, DVT was detected in 24 (10%) patients while SVT in 35 (14.6%) patients. During follow-up, one upper extremity DVT was found. D-dimer levels were higher in patients with DVT than in those without. Sensitivity and specificity of D-dimer for DVT were 92% (95%CI: 73–99%) and 60% (95%CI: 52–67%) respectively, with a negative predictive value of 98% (95%CI: 93–100%), whereas for SVT they were 77% (95%CI: 59–89%) and 60% (95%CI: 52–67%) respectively, with a negative predictive value of 93% (95%CI: 86–97%).

Conclusions

D-dimer has a negative predictive value ≥ 93% for excluding DVT in symptomatic outpatients and it can be a useful test in the diagnostic work-up of suspected upper extremity DVT.

Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). High credibility.

Table II — Outcome of superficial truncal ablation in patients with deep vein reflux (DVR): High ligation and stripping (HL&S) with phlebectomy and perforator ligation achieved 94% (16/17) resolution of DVR (at a mean of 62 days [range, 4–278 days]). With HL&S or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) plus adjuncts, 24% (9/38) had complete resolution and 32% (19/59 segments) had segmental resolution of DVR. In an endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) cohort, improvement (Venous Clinical Severity Score [VCSS]) was independent of DVR and DVR had no effect on endothermal heat induced thrombosis (EHIT), thrombophlebitis, paresthesias, saphenous occlusion rates or bruising. After RFA-based therapy, DVR improved (all) or resolved (30.2%) with superficial venous ablation, and DVR did not impact symptom/quality of life (QOL) improvement after superficial endovenous ablation. Another RFA series reported DVR was reduced to 29 limbs (13%, P < .01) and deep vein diameters were also reduced. In a retrospective review of the Vascular Quality Initiative registry, there was no difference in symptom improvement between groups; patients with DVR had greater improvement in VCSS but an increased rate of proximal thrombus extension (3.1% vs 1.1%; P < .001).

### A systematic review and meta-analysis for the association between duration of anticoagulation therapy and the risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with lower limb superficial venous thrombosis [^1c41670d]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Superficial venous thrombosis (SVT) of lower limbs, also known as superficial thrombophlebitis, has been considered a self-limited benign disorder for a long time, with an incidence rate of 0.6 to 1.3 SVT events per 1000 patient-years. However, emerging evidence suggests a high prevalence of concurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in 18% and 7% of all patients with SVT, respectively. The cohort studies with a mid-term follow-up of 3 months showed an occurrence of further venous thromboembolism (VTE), including SVT progression or recurrence, new DVT, and/or PE in 3% to 10% of all patients. In the long-term follow-up, a history of SVT has shown an association with a VTE risk increase of 5.4 to 8.6 times, and the risk of VTE recurrence after SVT is similar to proximal DVT. All such findings suggest SVT should be combined with DVT and PE into the group of VTE and be treated with anticoagulation, as stated in the recent guidelines. The previous meta-analysis included different SVT treatment approaches (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], unfractionated heparin [UFH], low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH], fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, warfarin, surgery, and no therapy) and showed that anticoagulation is associated with minimal events rate of further VTE. However, no standard anticoagulation type, dose, and duration were described. Although emerging evidence suggests a further increase of VTE rate by 50% to 70% after 45 days of anticoagulation in high-risk patients, a knowledge gap has been found on the association of prolonged anticoagulation with VTE risk in individuals with SVT. This study aims to address this gap.

Results

Study selection and characteristics

We identified 5036 citations (Fig 1) through our initial literature search and included 120 studies in our full-text review. A total of 55 studies met our inclusion criteria with relevant data on our outcomes and were included in the final meta-analysis. The 55 studies included 15,594 patients diagnosed with UEVT; 16 studies were prospective and 15 were multicenter studies. The characteristics of the included studies are presented in Supplementary Table I (online only). Of these, 50 studies reported data on the occurrence of VTE recurrence,17 reported PTS, and 39 reported bleeding. Only 10 studies evaluated VTE recurrence, bleeding, and PTS. We did not identify any randomized controlled trials. All included studies were observational cohort studies. Unprovoked thrombosis accounted for 16.7% of UEVT in 42 studies. Of the 15,594 patients, 51% were women. The mortality rate was 14.1% (range, 0%-78.1%).

Evidence

These recommendations are supported by two recent systematic reviews, (Table XXIV). The 2018 Cochrane review included 33 studies involving 7296 patients with SVT of the legs. Treatments evaluated included fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, LMWH, unfractionated heparin, NSAIDS, compression stockings, and topical, intramuscular, or intravenous treatment as well as surgical thrombectomy or ligation. A minority of studies compared treatment to placebo and most studies were small and of poor quality. Further, most studies excluded patients with SVT that was within 3 cm of the SFJ. The recommendations are primarily based on one large placebo controlled RCT of 3002 participants who received fondaparinux and demonstrated a significant reduction in symptomatic VTE, SVT extension, and SVT recurrence in comparison with placebo. Major bleeding was infrequent in both groups. A second systematic review and meta-analysis included seventeen studies and 6862 patients with SVT and confirmed that fondaparinux achieved the lowest rate of progression to DVT and PE without conclusions about other treatment due to low quality evidence. In the Surprise study, patients with SVT and one or more risk factors for VTE were randomized to 45 days of fondaparinux or rivaroxaban 10 mg. The results suggested that rivaroxaban was as effective as fondaparinux, however, the study was not powered to prove noninferiority. A call for further studies was prompted by the nonsignificant increase in the primary composite outcome as well as by an increase in clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding in the rivaroxaban group. These recommendations are similar to those, published recently on management of SVT in the CHEST guidelines.

Table XXIV
Treatment of superficial venous thrombosis

Low-quality evidence in one study found that prophylactic LMWH reduced extension of SVT (statistically significant), but did not reduce incidence of VTE, while therapeutic LMWH evaluated in one study reduced both SVT extension (statistically significant) and progression to VTE, but improvement was less significant at 3 month follow-up due to a catch-up phenomenon.NSAIDS were also found in one study to reduce SVT extension (statistically significant). However, there were no differences in the resolution of local symptoms and signs of SVT and in the incidence of VTE. While there were no major bleeding episodes recorded in either the NSAID or placebo groups, indomethacin increased the rate of adverse effects.NSAIDs have also been found to increase the risk of gastric pain three-fold compared with placebo.

### Diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis of the upper extremity: a systematic review and meta-analysis of test accuracy [^c3aaa58f]. Blood Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (UEDVT) accounts for ≤ 10% of DVT and can be associated with morbidity and mortality. Accurate diagnosis and treatment are necessary for safe and effective patient management. We systematically reviewed the accuracy of D-dimer and duplex ultrasonography (US) for the evaluation of suspected first-episode UEDVT. We searched the Cochrane Central Register, OVID MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed for eligible studies, reference lists of relevant reviews, registered trials, and relevant conference proceedings. We included prospective cross-sectional and cohort studies that evaluated test accuracy. Two investigators independently screened and collected data. The risk of bias was assessed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 and certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. We pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity. The review included 9 studies. The pooled estimates for D-dimer sensitivity and specificity were 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87–0.99) and 0.47 (95% CI, 0.43–0.52), respectively. The pooled estimates for duplex US sensitivity and specificity were 0.87 (95% CI, 0.73–0.94) and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.72–0.93), respectively. Certainty of evidence was moderate. In this review, we summarized the test accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of D-dimer and duplex US for this indication. The sensitivity and specificity of the tests found in the present review should be considered in the context of whether they are used alone or in combination, which is dependent on the prevalence of disease in the population, the clinical setting in which the patient is being evaluated, cost, potential harms, and patient outcomes. This study was registered at PROSPERO as Systematic Review Registration Number CRD42018098488.

### Thrombolysis for acute upper extremity deep vein thrombosis [^17d8c31e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

About 5% to 10% of all deep vein thromboses occur in the upper extremities. Serious complications of upper extremity deep vein thrombosis, such as post-thrombotic syndrome and pulmonary embolism, may in theory be avoided using thrombolysis. No systematic review has assessed the effects of thrombolysis for the treatment of individuals with acute upper extremity deep vein thrombosis.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of thrombolysis for the treatment of individuals with acute upper extremity deep vein thrombosis.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Specialised Register (29 March 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 2), and three trial registries (World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ISRCTN registry) for ongoing and unpublished studies. We additionally searched the registries of the European Medical Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration (December 2016).

Selection Criteria

We planned to include randomised clinical trials irrespective of publication type, publication date and language that investigated the effects of thrombolytics added to anticoagulation, thrombolysis versus anticoagulation, or thrombolysis versus any other type of medical intervention for the treatment of acute upper extremity deep vein thrombosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened all records to identify those that met inclusion criteria. We planned to use the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We planned to use trial domains to assess the risks of systematic error (bias) in the trials. We planned to conduct trial sequential analyses to control for the risk of random errors and to assess the robustness of our conclusions. We planned to consider a P value of 0.025 or less as statistically significant. We planned to assess the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Our primary outcomes were severe bleeding, pulmonary embolism, and all-cause mortality.

Main Results

We found no trials eligible for inclusion. We also identified no ongoing trials.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently insufficient evidence from which to draw conclusion on the benefits or harms of thrombolysis for the treatment of individuals with acute upper extremity deep vein thrombosis as an add-on therapy to anticoagulation, alone compared with anticoagulation, or alone compared with any other type of medical intervention. Large randomised clinical trials with a low risk of bias are warranted. They should focus on clinical outcomes and not solely on surrogate measures.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^24b447e0]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (UEDVT) — thrombolysis versus anticoagulation: In patients with acute UEDVT that involves the axillary or more proximal veins, the guideline states "we suggest anticoagulant therapy alone over thrombolysis (Grade 2C)". Thrombolysis is described as most likely to benefit those meeting explicit criteria — "severe symptoms; thrombus involving most of the subclavian vein and the axillary vein; symptoms for < 14 days; good functional status; life expectancy of ≥ 1 year; and low risk for bleeding" — and the panel "suggested CDT over systemic thrombolysis" to reduce drug dose and bleeding risk. For patients who do undergo thrombolysis, the panel specifies "we recommend the same intensity and duration of anticoagulant therapy as in patients with UEDVT who do not undergo thrombolysis (Grade 1B)". The remarks add that patients prioritizing prevention of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS), with access to catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) and tolerance for complexity, cost, and bleeding risk, "are likely to choose thrombolytic therapy over anticoagulation alone".

12. Management of SVT in patients with varicose and nonvaricose veins

Guideline 12. Address the management of SVT in patients who have not recently undergone superficial venous interventions. The management of EHIT and other thrombotic complications of superficial venous interventions were presented in Guidelines 11.

12.1.1. For patients with SVT of the main saphenous trunks and tributaries above the knee > 3 cm from the SFJ and ≥ 5 cm in length, whether or not associated with varicose veins, we recommend fondaparinux 2.5 mg subcutaneously daily for 45 days; alternatively, rivaroxaban 10 mg/d for 45 days may be appropriate for patients unwilling or unable to perform subcutaneous injections.

GUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation: 1 (strong), Quality of Evidence: A (high)

12.1.2. For patients with SVT of the main saphenous trunks ≤ 3 cm from the SFJ, treatment with full anticoagulation for a minimum of 6 weeks should be continued.

Consensus statement

12.1.3 For patients with SVT of the main saphenous trunks we suggest against using prophylactic or therapeutic dose low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). While both have been found to reduce SVT pain and extension, they have failed to prevent VTE. If NSAIDs are used for treatment of short segment distal SVT, surveillance with DUS for VTE extension is recommended due to the high prevalence of concomitant DVT.

GUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation: 1 (strong), Quality of Evidence: A (high)

12.1.4. For selected patients with isolated thrombosis of varicose tributaries or limited involvement of the GSV, we suggest phlebectomy as a safe alternative.

GUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak), Quality of Evidence: B (moderate)

12.1.5. In patients with saphenous thrombophlebitis, ablation should be performed once the inflammation has resolved if there is evidence of pathologic reflux on DUS.

### Superficial venous thrombosis and compression ultrasound imaging [^55834e71]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

A current debate concerning suspected superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) focuses on the need of performing a compression ultrasound (CUS) exploration for confirming the diagnosis of SVT. This study was conducted to determine the clinical relevance and optimal CUS exploration in patients with symptomatic SVT.

Methods

We analyzed the characteristics of SVT and concomitant deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients included in the Prospective Observational Superficial Thrombophlebitis (POST) multicenter, observational prospective study. All patients underwent complete bilateral lower limb CUS, exploring both the superficial and deep venous systems.

Results

A total of 844 patients with clinical symptoms of SVT were recruited, of which 99 isolated SVTs (21.4%) had saphenofemoral/popliteal junction involvement, and 198 (23.5%) had a concomitant DVT, with 41.8% of them proximal DVTs. In 83 patients (41.9%), DVT and SVT were not contiguous. Five of 639 patients (1%) had an isolated contralateral DVT (ie, not bilateral). Age ≥ 75 years (odds ratio [OR], 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6–3.4), inpatient status (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 3.4–8.7), a personal history of DVT or pulmonary embolism (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2–2.8), and SVT on nonvaricose veins (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 2.1–5.0) were significantly and independently associated with an increased risk of concomitant DVT. Half of the patients exhibited none of these risk factors, and the prevalence of concomitant DVT dropped to 11%.

Conclusions

In patients with symptomatic SVT, a CUS exploration screening the whole venous system of the affected limb is useful because it provides information that has important consequences for the management of these patients.

Recommendation 11b

For neonates with nonocclusive PVT, and for children who have already developed portal hypertension (PHTN) secondary to PVT, the ASH/ISTH guideline panel suggests no anticoagulation rather than using anticoagulation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects ⊕◯◯◯).

Remarks: For recommendations 11a and 11b: neonates and pediatric patients who did not receive anticoagulation warrant follow-up monitoring, because extension of thrombus or organ dysfunction may require reconsideration of treatment options. Evidence from the available observational studies describes (complete or partial) PVT resolution in patients who did receive anticoagulation, as well as those who did not receive anticoagulation, and therefore, does not allow for assessment of the degree of benefit from anticoagulation. However, the panel placed value on avoiding the potential increased risk of long-term complications associated with persistent occlusive thrombus, and therefore, favored treatment in this setting. The panel also recognized the potential increased risk of bleeding in pediatric patients with PHTN and development of esophageal varices, and therefore, did not recommend anticoagulation in that setting.

Recommendation 12a

For pediatric patients with superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) secondary to IV cannulation in the upper limb, the ASH/ISTH guideline panel suggests no anticoagulation rather than using anticoagulation. (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁◯◯◯).

Recommendation 12b

For pediatric patients with SVT in the upper limb, which is not cannula related, or in the lower limbs associated with cancer or varicose veins, the ASH/ISTH guideline panel suggests anticoagulation rather than no anticoagulation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁◯◯◯).

Remarks: There were no direct and only limited indirect data upon which to base this recommendation. The panel members experience suggested that, in most instances (eg, peripheral IV [PIV]– or CVAD-related events in the upper extremity), no anticoagulation may be required. However, anticoagulation could be considered in select patients with symptomatic SVT (eg, non–PIV-/PICC (peripherally inserted central catheter)-related, cancer, varicose vein, and lower limb events) or scenarios (eg, PIV/long-term PICC and/or symptom progression). The panel notes that when anticoagulation is prescribed, there is uncertainty about the optimal intensity (eg, prophylactic vs full dose) and duration of therapy.

### Post-thrombotic syndrome after upper extremity deep vein thrombosis: an international Delphi consensus study [^186a0226]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objectives

Primary deep vein thrombosis of the upper extremity (UEDVT) is a rare condition but up to 60% of patients may develop post‐thrombotic syndrome in the upper extremity (UE‐PTS) with significant morbidity and decreased quality of life. However, there is no universally accepted method to diagnose and classify UE‐PTS, hampering scientific research on UEDVT treatment. Through this international Delphi consensus study we aimed to determine what a clinical score for diagnosing UE‐PTS should entail.

Methods

An online focus group survey among 20 patients treated for UEDVT was performed to provide clinical parameters before the start of a four round electronic Delphi consensus study among 25 international experts. The CREDES recommendations on Conducting and Reporting Delphi Studies were applied. Open text questions, multiple selection questions, and 9‐point Likert scales were used. Consensus was set at 70% agreement.

Results

After four rounds, agreement was reached on a composite score of five symptoms and three clinical signs, combined with a functional disability score. The signs and symptom will each be scored on a severity scale of 0–3 and the total score expressed as an ordinal variable; no/mild/moderate/or severe PTS. The functional disability portion measures the impact of the signs and symptoms on the functionality of the patient's arm.

Conclusion

Consensus was reached on a composite score of signs and symptoms of UE‐PTS combined with a functional disability score. Clinical validation of the UE‐PTS score in a large patient cohort is mandatory to facilitate application in future research.

### Tibial vein thrombosis after foam sclerotherapy: a single-institution case series [^51991597]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Article Highlights

- **Type of Research**: Retrospective cohort study
- **Key Findings**: Of 54 patients, tibial thrombus management included antiplatelet therapy (55%), anticoagulation (26%), or observation (20%). At final follow-up (median 35 days), thrombus resolved in 53%, decreased in 20%, and remained stable in 27% of patients without enlargement or propagation. Symptom resolution was achieved in 87% of patients, with no significant differences between management strategies.
- **Take Home Message**: Tibial deep vein thromboses after foam sclerotherapy demonstrate a benign clinical course regardless of management strategy.

Ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy is a commonly used treatment modality for symptomatic superficial venous disease and is typically well tolerated with low complication rates. Contact of the sclerosant leads to endothelial damage, thereby initiating vasospasm and thrombosis. This is absorbed over time and leads to transformation of the treated vein into a fibrous cord. Common local adverse effects include hyperpigmentation, pain, or superficial thrombophlebitis, whereas known systemic adverse events include transient ischemic attack, visual disturbances, pulmonary embolism, and deep venous thrombosis (DVT). DVT is uncommon, with reported incidence ranging from < 0.5% to 6%, in some series. Higher incidence is seen with distal varicosities, lower-leg veins, and when ≥ 10 cc of sclerosant is used.

Proximal DVTs are defined as those involving the popliteal, femoral, or iliac veins, and the standard treatment is anticoagulation. Conversely, treatment for acute distal DVTs after sclerotherapy is less clear. Clinical practice guidelines have proposed guidelines, but the recommendations are weak, with only moderate-quality evidence to support observation and serial imaging. Specifically for tibial DVTs that develop in the setting of endovenous ablation, incidence is low, and therefore, there has been limited research on the natural progression of these thrombi. As a result, the clinical implication of these provoked calf DVTs, including propagation or embolization risk, remains unclear. Consequently, current management strategies vary considerably, including patient surveillance with ultrasound, anticoagulation, or antiplatelet therapy. Therefore, it is unclear how to optimally manage patients who develop provoked tibial DVTs in the setting of foam sclerotherapy.

### Nonoperative management of acute upper limb ischemia [^b20fa640]. Hand (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute upper limb ischemia (AULI) is an uncommon emergency warranting immediate evaluation and treatment. The role of nonsurgical therapies including endovascular techniques, thrombolytics, and anticoagulation remains undefined. The authors systematically reviewed the current literature on the nonsurgical treatment of acute ischemia of the upper extremity.

Methods

A PubMed and Embase search was conducted, and articles were screened using predetermined criteria. Data collected included patient demographics, cause of upper limb ischemia, type of nonsurgical treatment used, treatment outcomes, and complications. Patients were divided into 4 treatment groups: catheter embolectomy, catheter-directed thrombolysis, endovascular stenting, and anticoagulation/medical therapy alone.

Results

Twenty-three retrospective studies met the search criteria. Of 1326 reported occlusions, 92% (1221) were attributed to thromboembolic disease. The second most common cause was iatrogenic (1.5%). Overall limb salvage rates were excellent with catheter embolectomy (862 of 882 cases, 97.7%) and catheter-directed thrombolysis (110 of 114 cases, 96.5%). Limb salvage rates were also high with anticoagulation/medical therapy (158 of 165 cases, 95.8%), but poor functional outcomes were more often reported.

Conclusions

High-quality evidence to guide the nonsurgical treatment of AULI is lacking. Retrospective studies support the utility of catheter-based embolectomy and thrombolysis for distal ischemia. Whether a surgical or nonsurgical approach is taken, anticoagulation therapy remains a mainstay of both treatment and prevention of AULI. Because AULI patients often have underlying cardiac and/or systemic disease, a multidisciplinary approach is essential to minimize complications and prevent future occurrences.

### Post-thrombotic syndrome after upper extremity deep vein thrombosis: an international Delphi consensus study [^5a98e6d2]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Research on the treatment of UEDVT is hampered by the absence of an accepted UE‐PTS score by both clinicians and patients as a universal primary outcome measure. In this article we present an international consensus on what experts believe to be the most important clinical signs and symptoms of UE‐PTS and what a clinical scoring method for UE‐PTS should entail. With these five symptoms and three clinical signs of UE‐PTS in combination with a scaling option for severity and an additional functional disability score, we made a proposal for a preliminary UE‐PTS score.

Notably, there are some resemblances between the Villalta scale and the presented UE‐PTS score, but there are several aspects that set the UE‐PTS score apart. Not only are the proposed signs and symptoms now tailored to UE‐PTS when compared to the Villalta scale but more importantly, a functional disability aspect has been added to the scoring method. This allows the physician to measure the impact of a patients' signs and symptoms on their functional capabilities. The experts thereby provided a clear statement that to properly measure UE‐PTS a combination of typical signs and symptoms, and their impact on a patient's functional capabilities, are required. This is in line with the recently published Post‐VTE Functional Status (PFVS) scale that was developed to better assess the functional limitations after VTE in the lower extremity.

### American Society of Hematology / International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2024 updated guidelines for treatment of venous thromboembolism in pediatric patients [^53e7409c]. Blood Advances (2025). High credibility.

SVT in pediatrics — panel certainty, applicability, and research needs: The guideline panel determined that there is very low certainty in the evidence for a net health benefit from using anticoagulation in pediatric patients with SVT, and although RCTs in adults may suggest benefit, there are no randomized trials in pediatric patients with SVT. Based on these considerations, the previous ASH 2018 guidelines could not recommend anticoagulation or no anticoagulation for managing such cases; more recent adult studies pointed toward an evolution favoring anticoagulation, and the panel identified a small desirable effect of anticoagulation. Applicability is limited because most pediatric SVTs are PIV or CVAD related and located in the upper extremity, with natural history differing from typical adult SVT. The panel highlighted research needs including studies on natural history and DVT/PE complications by patient and SVT characteristics and venous bed health, studies assessing ideal diagnostic methods and imaging protocols in SVT subgroups, and studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of anticoagulation of different intensities of pediatric SVT.
