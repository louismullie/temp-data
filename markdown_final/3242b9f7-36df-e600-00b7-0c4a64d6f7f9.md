## Question

How to identify cerebral spinal fluid leak from nose

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to identify a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak from the nose. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical presentation and red flags that raise suspicion. Then, I should verify the best confirmatory laboratory test and its handling. Next, I will review imaging choices for localization and when to escalate to invasive studies. After that, I need to consider special populations and pitfalls that can mislead diagnosis. Finally, I will synthesize a practical diagnostic algorithm and highlight what to do if initial tests are negative but suspicion remains high.

> Let me first confirm the clinical phenotype that should trigger suspicion. CSF rhinorrhea typically presents as unilateral, clear, watery discharge that is positional, worsening with forward lean or dependent head position, and often tasteless; it may be continuous or intermittent, and patients may report a salty taste or a sense of fluid trickling down the throat, especially when supine [^111Q6Ym4] [^113izuNy]. I should double-check that congestion is absent, because CSF lacks the inflammatory mucus seen in rhinitis, and I need to ask about recent head trauma, neurosurgery, or sinonasal surgery, as these are common precipitants; spontaneous leaks are less common but increasingly recognized, particularly in the setting of obesity and idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^111Q6Ym4] [^114do843].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — clear rhinorrhea has a broad differential. Allergic rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, and acute rhinosinusitis can all mimic CSF, so I need to check for accompanying features like congestion, sneezing, facial pain, or purulence that would favor non-CSF etiologies; importantly, CSF rhinorrhea is typically nonpurulent and nonviscous, and it does not respond to anticholinergic sprays like ipratropium, which can be a useful screening discriminator in select patients [^115g9Kvs] [^1172H5kQ]. I should also remember pseudo-CSF rhinorrhea from autonomic dysfunction after skull base trauma, which presents with clear rhinorrhea but a negative beta-2 transferrin and may improve with anticholinergic therapy or sphenopalatine ganglion interventions [^117Fuh85].

> Next, I should review the confirmatory laboratory test. Wait, let me verify the current standard: beta-2 transferrin electrophoresis remains the preferred test because it is found almost exclusively in CSF, perilymph, and vitreous fluid, offering high sensitivity and specificity; samples are stable at room temperature for up to a week, which facilitates collection and transport, and I should ensure adequate volume (about 0.5–1 mL) for reliable testing [^111Q6Ym4] [^115HunQ8]. I need to ensure the lab I use performs immunofixation electrophoresis correctly, as false negatives can occur with inadequate technique or degraded samples, though stability is generally good over several days [^115HunQ8].

> I should confirm alternatives when beta-2 transferrin is unavailable or equivocal. Beta-trace protein (prostaglandin D synthase) is a reasonable alternative, but I need to check for confounders: renal insufficiency elevates serum beta-trace and can cause false positives, and bacterial meningitis lowers CSF beta-trace, so results must be interpreted in clinical context; recent data suggest an optimal nasal mucus cutoff around 1.40 mg/L, but I should corroborate with beta-2 transferrin when possible to avoid misclassification [^112L4Gcq] [^116QUBQs]. But wait, what if the fluid is scant or collection is impractical? In that scenario, I can consider a bedside fluorescein pledget test, recognizing it is supportive rather than definitive; yellow-to-green color change with fluorescein-soaked cotton in the nasal cavity suggests CSF, but I should confirm with beta-2 transferrin whenever feasible [^111aQVrb].

> Now, I will examine imaging for localization once CSF is confirmed or strongly suspected. High-resolution noncontrast CT of the skull base with thin slices (≤ 1 mm) and multiplanar reconstructions is my first-line modality to identify bony defects; sensitivity for defect detection is high, often exceeding 90% in experienced hands, though it does not directly show active leakage and may miss tiny or multifocal defects [^116bBeMz] [^112N5ukZ]. Hold on, I should verify when to escalate: if CT is negative or equivocal, or if I need to confirm active leakage, MRI cisternography with heavily T2-weighted sequences (CISS/FIESTA) or gadolinium-enhanced MR cisternography can demonstrate CSF signal traversing a defect and is particularly useful for low-flow or intermittent leaks; CT cisternography with intrathecal contrast remains an option when MRI is contraindicated or nondiagnostic, though it is invasive and less favored today [^1154132y] [^111NVct9]. I need to ensure I correlate imaging with endoscopic findings, as endoscopy can visualize meningoceles or encephaloceles and guide targeted repair planning [^112N5ukZ].

> Let me consider special populations and pitfalls so I don't miss atypical presentations. In pregnancy, spontaneous CSF leaks can occur and may improve postpartum, so I should coordinate multidisciplinary care and avoid unnecessary radiation when possible; neuraxial anesthesia can still be performed safely with appropriate precautions [^1133ahxw]. In children, congenital skull base defects or craniopharyngeal canals can be the source, and persistent clear rhinorrhea warrants early imaging and beta-2 transferrin testing to prevent delays in diagnosis and complications [^114UFaao]. In patients with obesity or suspected idiopathic intracranial hypertension, spontaneous leaks are more common and recurrence after repair is higher, so I should evaluate for raised intracranial pressure and consider CSF diversion strategies if indicated [^114do843] [^111Bs3qC].

> I should double-check for iatrogenic and trauma-related causes that are easily overlooked. Nasal instrumentation (NG tubes, thermometers, COVID swabs) and CPAP therapy have been reported to precipitate CSF leaks, so a careful history of recent nasal procedures or pressure exposure is essential; in these cases, the clinical course and imaging may reveal a new or enlarged skull base defect with meningocele formation [^113Njghu] [^116Jbs9N] [^1171qXXc]. Postoperative leaks after endoscopic skull base surgery require vigilance for dependent clear rhinorrhea, the halo sign, or pneumocephalus patterns that predict failure; early beta-2 transferrin testing and endoscopic reassessment are prudent when suspicion is high [^116Uii74] [^112S7pkL].

> Next, I should review a practical diagnostic algorithm and ensure it aligns with evidence. Start with history and exam to characterize the discharge and risk factors; if suspicion is moderate to high, obtain beta-2 transferrin on nasal fluid; if positive, proceed to high-resolution skull base CT for bony defect localization; if CT is negative or equivocal, obtain MRI cisternography to confirm active leakage and soft-tissue pathology; if all noninvasive tests are negative but suspicion remains, consider CT cisternography or intrathecal fluorescein with endoscopy for definitive localization, balancing invasiveness and risk [^111Q6Ym4] [^112N5ukZ] [^1146sRr3]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not over-ordering invasive tests; reserving cisternography or intrathecal fluorescein for unresolved cases helps avoid unnecessary morbidity and radiation exposure [^1154132y].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have addressed immediate safety. While confirming the diagnosis, I should counsel on strict activity restriction (avoid nose blowing, heavy lifting, straining), maintain hydration, and monitor for meningitis signs; if a leak is confirmed or strongly suspected, early ENT/neurosurgery consultation is indicated because persistent CSF rhinorrhea carries a meaningful risk of meningitis and may require surgical closure, especially if conservative measures fail or the defect is large [^111Q6Ym4] [^1177by2q]. I should confirm that patients know to seek urgent care for fever, neck stiffness, photophobia, or altered mental status, as these herald CNS infection and mandate immediate evaluation and treatment [^111aQVrb].

CSF rhinorrhea is identified by **clear, watery, unilateral nasal discharge** that worsens with forward bending or Valsalva, and is often associated with headaches or a salty taste [^111Q6Ym4] [^116KgUP7]. The most reliable test is **beta-2 transferrin** in nasal fluid, which is highly specific and stable at room temperature for up to a week [^111Q6Ym4] [^115HunQ8]. High-resolution CT of the skull base is the first-line imaging to localize bony defects, while MRI cisternography or CT cisternography is used if the leak is intermittent or the site remains unclear [^112N5ukZ] [^1154132y]. Prompt recognition and confirmation are essential to prevent meningitis and guide definitive endoscopic repair [^1177by2q] [^112Q2hFR].

---

## Clinical presentation and risk factors

CSF rhinorrhea typically presents with the following **clinical features**:

- **Clear, watery discharge**: Unilateral, continuous or intermittent, and often worsens with forward bending, Valsalva maneuver, or exertion [^111Q6Ym4] [^116KgUP7].

- **Positional headache**: Orthostatic headaches are common, especially in spontaneous leaks associated with intracranial hypotension [^115hgdBm].

- **Salty taste**: Patients may report a salty or metallic taste due to CSF drainage into the oropharynx [^115g9Kvs].

- **History of trauma or surgery**: Recent head trauma, neurosurgery, or sinonasal surgery increases suspicion [^111Q6Ym4] [^116KgUP7].

Risk factors include **trauma, iatrogenic injury, spontaneous leaks** associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension or empty sella, and congenital anomalies such as encephaloceles [^114do843] [^113mNV68].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Clinical assessment

During clinical assessment, **history** should document the onset, duration, and characteristics of nasal discharge, as well as any recent trauma, surgery, or headaches [^111Q6Ym4]. The **physical examination** includes anterior rhinoscopy to visualize clear fluid in the nasal cavity and assess for other nasal pathology [^116KgUP7].

---

### Laboratory tests

- **Beta-2 transferrin**: This is the gold standard test for CSF detection. It is highly specific and sensitive, and samples remain stable at room temperature for up to a week [^111Q6Ym4] [^115HunQ8].

- **Beta-trace protein**: An alternative marker, but less specific than beta-2 transferrin, especially in patients with renal impairment or bacterial meningitis [^112L4Gcq] [^114Kzvtn].

- **Glucose test**: Historically used, but now discouraged due to poor specificity and false positives from nasal secretions or blood contamination [^111bwEoX] [^111aQVrb].

---

### Imaging modalities

Imaging is essential for **localizing the site of the leak** and planning surgical intervention:

| **Imaging modality** | **Indications** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| High-resolution CT (HRCT) | First-line for all suspected leaks | - Detects bony defects with high sensitivity (92%) and specificity (100%) [^112N5ukZ] <br/> - Noninvasive | Cannot visualize dural defects or active leaks [^112N5ukZ] |
| MRI cisternography | - Intermittent leaks <br/> - Soft tissue assessment | - Noninvasive <br/> - Detects meningoceles and encephaloceles [^112N5ukZ] <br/> - High sensitivity for active leaks | False positives from nasal secretions or artifacts [^1154132y] |
| CT cisternography | Equivocal cases or when MRI is contraindicated | High sensitivity for active leaks | Invasive and involves radiation exposure [^1154132y] |

---

### Special diagnostic techniques

Intrathecal fluorescein, administered via lumbar puncture, aids intraoperative localization of the leak site and has high sensitivity and specificity [^1146sRr3] [^1176jpkE]. Topical intranasal fluorescein is a **noninvasive alternative** for intraoperative localization, with reported accuracy ≥ 96% and no major complications [^116k7zL4] [^113dqcfs].

---

## Differential diagnosis

CSF rhinorrhea must be differentiated from other causes of clear nasal discharge, including:

- **Allergic rhinitis**: Typically bilateral, associated with sneezing, itching, and congestion [^1172H5kQ].

- **Vasomotor rhinitis**: Triggered by environmental factors, often bilateral [^1172H5kQ].

- **Nasal secretions**: Thicker, mucous discharge, usually associated with upper respiratory infections [^notfound].

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

Surgical repair is indicated for:

- **Persistent leaks**: Lasting more than 7–10 days despite conservative management [^notfound].

- **High-risk patients**: Obesity, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, or recurrent leaks [^111Bs3qC].

- **Failed conservative therapy**: Including bed rest, head elevation, and lumbar drainage [^notfound].

Endoscopic endonasal repair is the **preferred surgical approach**, with success rates exceeding 90% and low complication rates [^112Q2hFR] [^111Bs3qC].

---

## Potential complications of untreated CSF rhinorrhea

Untreated CSF rhinorrhea can lead to **significant morbidity and mortality**, including:

- **Meningitis**: Occurs in 7–30% of patients with persistent leaks [^1177by2q].

- **Brain abscess**: Rare but serious complication [^111YrpCb].

- **Intracranial hypotension**: Chronic headaches and neurological deficits [^115hgdBm].

---

## Follow-up and recurrence

Postoperative follow-up should include clinical assessment for recurrent discharge, periodic **beta-2 transferrin testing**, and imaging if recurrence is suspected. Recurrence rates vary with etiology, with **higher rates in spontaneous leaks** associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^111Bs3qC].

---

Identifying CSF rhinorrhea relies on **clinical suspicion, beta-2 transferrin testing, and imaging** to localize the leak. Early recognition and definitive endoscopic repair are essential to prevent serious complications such as meningitis and intracranial hypotension.

### Endonasal endoscopic repair of spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leaks… [^113V4sJS]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Of the 21 patients, 5 reported temporary CSF leak from one nasal cavity whereas liquorrhea was permanent in the other 16 patients; and 19 patients had both anterior and postnasal CSF discharge whereas 2 patients who did not report release of CSF from the nostrils experienced permanent leakage from the nasal cavity onto the posterior pharyngeal wall, which caused irritation and cough. Preoperative examination included high-resolution computed tomographic scans of the paranasal sinuses and skull base, nasal endoscopy, and evaluation of glucose concentration in the nasal discharge. When initial CT scans did not identify a bone defect in the skull base, patients underwent cisternographic evaluation via CT and/or magnetic resonance imaging. Computed tomography and cisternographic evaluation via CT or magnetic resonance imaging were able to detect the precise site of the fistula in 17 cases.

In the 4 remaining cases, the bone defect itself was not visualized; however, local mucosal edema caused by irritation, collection of CSF in specific sinuses, or ethmoidal cells suggested the fistula's location. A common finding in this series was extremely pneumatized sphenoid sinuses that extended to the apex of the temporal pyramid. In 5 cases, a bone defect and/or a small meningocele appearing to be the source of the CSF leak were found in the lateral wall of the overpneumatized sphenoid sinus. The surgical technique was dependent on the size and position of the fistula. The operation began with a careful endoscopic examination of the nasal cavity. Once the patient was in the supine position, examination often revealed fluid collection in the nasopharynx.

In cases of rapid CSF leaks, preoperative decongestion of the nasal mucosa and tractions on the middle turbinate identified a CSF pathway, from the natural ostium of the sphenoid sinus, or from the natural ostium of the posterior ethmoid sinus, or from the posterior part of the middle meatus on the upper wall of the choana. Recent studies13 indicate that an overpneumatized sphenoid sinus, and particularly its lateral extensions, is often a site where a CSF leak may appear. Extreme pneumatization of the sphenoid sinus may cause bone resorption in the skull base and, sometimes, a prolapse and tearing of the dura.

### The man with a persistently runny nose [^111coujp]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea is rarely seen in the emergency department (ED) and most often occurs after a traumatic event. Spontaneous CSF leaks are much less common and are often the result of benign intracranial hypertension. If not recognized early on, CSF infections are the most serious consequence of this condition and therefore its early diagnosis and treatment are essential. This case report describes a patient who presented to the ED with a CSF leak not caused by a traumatic event. The patient presented with persistent unilateral rhinorrhea and headache that had previously been misdiagnosed. It describes the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of this serious condition. This is a case report of an uncommon but potentially dangerous disease that carries high morbidity if not diagnosed and treated early. This disease must be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patient who presents with persistent atraumatic unilateral rhinorrhea. Although CSF leaks have been portrayed in the literature, this case report is unique because it describes a rare manifestation of this condition and its diagnosis by emergency physicians. This article presents the case, discusses the incidence, potential causes, predisposing factors, diagnostic modalities and the course of treatment for this particular diagnosis.

Rhinitis 2020 practice parameter — cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) leak recognition, testing, imaging, and treatment: Presentation "usually presents as a unilateral clear rhinorrhea, without congestion, often worsened in the upright position, and increased in frequency following head trauma or surgery; however, some cases may be spontaneous". Testing has shifted such that "A determination of beta-2 transferrin levels in nasal drainage is now the preferred test", and samples "can be collected and remain stable at room temperature for a week or more". For confirmation and surgical planning, "high-resolution CT and magnetic resonance cisternography are accurate, noninvasive, and complementary". Management is typically procedural, as "Treatment is often surgical in the form of endoscopic or open repair to prevent complications, which include meningitis".

Otolaryngologists have assumed a major role in the evaluation and management of anterior skull base defects that result in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks and meningoencephaloceles. To achieve the best possible results for patients with CSF leaks, a thorough understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and a critical analysis of management principles and treatment options is essential. Surgical and medical management of these patients is highly individualized and depends on a number of factors, including etiology, anatomic site, patient age, and underlying intracranial pressure. This review article will highlight the history, physiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, surgical techniques, and postoperative care relevant to nasal CSF leaks and encephaloceles.

### Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea and otorrhea: a case report and literature review [^115hgysy]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak is a condition that commonly presents with unilateral watery drainage from the nose or ear, tinnitus, and stuffy ears or hearing loss. Spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea and otorrhea together are rare. A 64-year-old woman presented at our department with complaints of clear watery rhinorrhea and hearing loss on the right side persisting for 10 months. Imaging and surgery were used to diagnose the condition. Through surgical treatment, she was eventually cured. Review of the literature has shown that patients with both nasal and aural CSF leaks are rare. When a patient presents with both unilateral watery drainage from both the nose and ear, a diagnosis of CSF rhinorrhea and otorrhea should be considered. This case report will benefit clinicians by providing more information to assist with diagnosing the disease.

Cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea and meningoencephaloceles extending into the nasal cavity from the anterior, middle, and posterior cranial fossae often are managed by otolaryngologists. A thorough understanding of the underlying pathophysiology, management principles, and treatment options is essential to achieve optimal outcomes. Surgical and medical management is highly individualized and depends on many factors, including etiology, anatomic site, and underlying intracranial pressure. This article highlights the history, physiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, surgical techniques, and postoperative care relevant to nasal cerebrospinal fluid leaks and encephaloceles.

### Community-acquired bacterial meningitis in adults with cerebrospinal fluid leakage [^1177by2q]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Risk factors for community-acquired bacterial meningitis include immunocompromise, distant foci of infection, and anatomic deficits in the natural barriers of the brain. Anatomic defects can be caused by congenital abnormalities of the skull, through contiguous spread of infection during ear and sinus infections, or after neurosurgery, ear-nose-throat (ENT) surgery, or neurotrauma, which can all lead to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage. Bacterial meningitis in patients with CSF leakage can be classified as community acquired, in case of anatomic defects or contiguous spread of infection, or nosocomial or healthcare-associated meningitis after surgery for trauma. Symptoms suggestive of CSF leakage include rhinorrhea and otorrhea, but CSF leakage may also go unnoticed. In patients with skull-base fracture due to head trauma, CSF leakage resolves spontaneously within 24 hours after onset, but once persistent, meningitis occurs in 7–30% of patients. Cerebrospinal fluid leakage has previously been reported in 3–8% of patients with community-acquired bacterial meningitis and in 38% of patients with recurrent meningitis. We evaluated patients with bacterial meningitis associated with identified CSF leakage from a prospective nationwide cohort study in adults with community-acquired bacterial meningitis.

### Assessing spinal cerebrospinal fluid leaks in intracranial hypotension with a scoring system based on brain MRIs… [^115hgdBm]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

A, Coronal illustration of the brain demonstrating normal findings. B, Coronal illustration of the brain with typical findings in a patient with a spinal cerebrospinal fluid leak with venous engorgement of the superior sagittal sinus, pachymeningeal enhancement, superficial siderosis, enlarged pituitary gland, prominent intercavernous sinus, effaced suprasellar cistern, and subdural fluid collection. C, Sagittal illustration of the posterior fossa demonstrating normal findings. D, Sagittal illustration of the posterior fossa with typical findings in patients with a spinal cerebrospinal fluid leak with effaced suprasellar cistern, effacement of the prepontine cistern, decreased mamillopontine distance, and low-lying cerebellar tonsils.

Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is a well-established condition generally presenting with disabling orthostatic headache, occasionally accompanied by other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and neck pain. The first imaging challenge to overcome is to recognize signs of intracranial hypotension on brain magnetic resonance imaging. The second is to identify an underlying treatable cause, such as a cerebrospinal fluid leak. The third is to localize the exact level of the dural breach along the spinal axis. The standardized diagnostic workup included detailed clinical history, optic nerve–sheath ultrasonography, lumbar-infusion testing, and a brain MRI followed by dedicated spinal imaging. On subsequent conventional dynamic myelography, the level of the CSF leak was defined as the area with the earliest epidural contrast spillage.

An updated literature review was performed to identify previously reported signs of intracranial hypotension on brain imaging. We suggest classifying patients in 3 groups according to specific cutoff scores: those with a score of 5 or more have a very high probability of a spinal CSF leak and therefore a high likelihood of a positive result on dynamic conventional or CT myelography. In these patients, an epidural blood patch should be promptly considered.

### New insights into the glucose oxidase stick test for cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhoea [^111bwEoX]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Rhinorrhoea is a clinical sign of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage in patients with skull fracture, but can also be attributable to respiratory secretions or tears. Laboratory tests confirming the presence of CSF are not sufficiently rapid to support clinical decision making in the emergency department and may not be universally available. Detection of glucose in nasal discharge was traditionally used to diagnose CSF leak at the bedside, but has fallen into disuse as it has poor positive predictive value. We propose an algorithm to improve the diagnostic value of this test taking into consideration factors we have found to affect the glucose concentration of respiratory secretions. In patients at risk of CSF leak, nasal discharge is likely to contain CSF if glucose is present in the absence of visible blood, if blood glucose is < 6 mmol × L⁻¹, and if there are no symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection.

CSF fistulas

The cribriform plate is a common site for acquired CSF fistula formation. A CSF fistula refers to an osteodural defect with consequent fistula formation. This typically presents with CSF rhinorrhoea that can be exacerbated on vagal manoeuvres, and obstructive nasal symptoms with olfactory disturbance. 80% of acquired CSF fistulas are secondary to trauma, most commonly in the setting of anterior skull base fractures. Less commonly, acquired CSF fistulas can arise secondary to iatrogenic causes, tumours, and chronically raised intracranial pressure. Post-traumatic CSF leaks are generally small and can be managed conservatively with bed rest. However even if small, a persistent CSF leak places the patient at increased risk of meningitis and surgery may be required. CT is the first-line to isolate the offending osteodural defect (Fig. 14) and does not require an active leak to be present unlike other imaging techniques (such as radionuclide imaging and CT cisternography). Though CT can detect even small osseous defects with a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 100%, a dural breach cannot be seen on CT. Isolating the specific site of a CSF fistula therefore becomes particularly problematic when there are numerous osseous defects, for example in the context of complex skull base trauma.

Correlation with MRI is useful in demonstrating a dural breach, as inferred by high T2 signal CSF (from "meningocele" formation) (Fig. 15). Herniation of brain tissue ("meningoencephalocele") can also be seen (Figs. 15 d, 16), whilst subtle traction-related adjacent encephalomalacia and dural enhancement are both secondary signs of CSF fistula formation. Heavily T2 weighted high spatial resolution CISS imaging provides optimal contrast between the CSF and the neighbouring brain and skull base and is a sensitive sequence for the detection of CSF fistulas. However, CSF fistulas must be differentiated from sinusitis and other fluid intensity substances such as nasal secretions. Accurate localisation of the defect can direct endoscopic surgical repair, which carries reduced morbidity and is therefore being increasingly adopted over open repair.

### Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak in a patient with asymptomatic idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^111YrpCb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks occur when there is a tear in the dura mater. Spontaneous CSF leaks are rare, and often associated with conditions like intracranial hypertension, connective tissue disorders, or congenital defects in the dura mater.

Case Report

The patient was a 66-year-old woman who presented to the Emergency Department with clear, positional nasal discharge from her left nostril for 1 week. She had a history of chronic headaches, which seemed to have been relieved around the time of onset of her rhinorrhea. Diagnostic imaging, including computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans, confirmed the presence of a CSF leak and a left temporal meningoencephalocele. The patient subsequently underwent surgical repair of the leak and ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement, and was discharged home in stable condition. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Early detection of CSF leaks require a thorough history and physical examination, and is crucial in preventing potentially life-threatening complications such as meningitis and intracranial abscesses.

### Imaging of cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea and otorrhea [^11331QLg]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

As the obesity epidemic grows in the United States, rhinorrhea and otorrhea from spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks secondary to untreated idiopathic intracranial hypertension are increasing in prevalence. CSF rhinorrhea and otorrhea should also be carefully evaluated in posttraumatic and postsurgical settings, because untreated CSF leaks often have serious consequences. The work-up, diagnosis, and characterization of a CSF leak can be complex, often requiring a multimodality approach to optimize surgical planning. This article reviews the causes of CSF leaks, describes the methodology used to work up a suspected leak, and discusses the challenges of making an accurate diagnosis.

### Cerebrospinal fluid leak associated with nasal continuous positive airway pressure treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea [^116Jbs9N]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Clear rhinorrhoea is a common symptom in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), which may worsen with nasal continuous positive airway pressure treatment (nCPAP). However, rhinorrhoea can also be the presenting symptom of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, which is due to a communication between the subarachnoid space and the nasal cavity or sinuses. We report another case of a patient with OSA in whom CSF leak developed following the initiation of nCPAP treatment.

### Spontaneous idiopathic cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea [^111Rg5kC]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea is described as cerebrospinal fluid flow through the nose due to the abnormal connection of the subarachnoid space and sinonasal cavity. Spontaneous idiopathic rhinorrhea is a rarely seen disease. Besides the patient's clinical presentation detailed radiological evaluation and other invasive procedures must be carried out to confirm the diagnosis. Its treatment is compelling due to high recurrence rates. In the treatment algorithm when conservative treatment modalities had been proven inadequate, surgical repair must follow in order. In this paper the authors present the details of 2 cases of spontaneous rhinorrhoea patients.

### More than just a' runny nose': a rare diagnosis of spontaneous CSF rhinorrhoea for a common symptom [^113Wy2KD]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Primary spontaneous cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhoea is a rare disease associated with female gender, obesity and empty sella syndrome. The authors describe the case of a 59-year-old woman who presented to her primary care physician with a 2-week history of drainage of a clear fluid from her right nostril that was initially treated as allergic rhinitis. A non-contrast CT scan revealed mucosal thickening in the right sphenoid sinus and a possible defect in the adjacent skull base. The patient initially declined a CT cisternogram, which provides greater sensitivity in assessing for a CSF leak. Nasal secretions tested positive for β-2-transferrin, which is highly sensitive and specific for CSF. After conservative interventions failed, a pedicled septal mucoperichondrial flap was used to patch the skeletal defect. At her 5-month follow-up, the patient remains asymptomatic.

### Technical review and considerations for a cerebrospinal fluid leakage study [^111JNhFz]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2006). Low credibility.

Within the past decade, published diagnostic algorithms for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage have included beta-2-transferrin analysis, rigid nasal endoscopy, high-resolution CT, CT cisternography, CT fluorescein lumbar puncture, and MRI but have not included the nuclear medicine CSF leakage study. However, some physicians still use this study today. This case report reviews the procedure and data calculations for the study. The presented case demonstrates how patient ingenuity in maintaining a compromised pledget for counting after sneezing contributed to the final diagnostic outcome. The patient was a 58-y-old man who presented with persistent nasal drainage and headaches, with no history of previous head trauma or surgery. The patient was referred to the nuclear medicine department for a CSF leakage study, which had positive findings and led to a final diagnosis of a large dural and skull defect posteriorly over the ethmoid sinuses.

### Postoperative management following endoscopic skull base reconstruction: a multidisciplinary cross-sectional survey [^1178Twrw]. Head & Neck (2025). Medium credibility.

This study demonstrated that common suspicious signs and symptoms of postoperative CSF leaks included meningitis, dependent clear fluid rhinorrhea, stress‐related rhinorrhea, and the "halo/ring" sign. Naturally, there is a significantly increased risk of meningitis with an active CSF leak. The halo/ring sign was considered at least moderately suspicious by 42% of respondents. However, the credibility of the halo/ring sign has been questioned. Although rhinorrhea (stress‐related or dependent) is another suspicious sign, testing this fluid, which involves checking for the presence of beta‐2‐transferrin, is difficult and sometimes impractical. This is due to several factors, including prolonged time to diagnosis, relatively high costs, and the need for outside specialized facilities and a certain quantity of sample. Despite this, 19% of the cohort reported that the turnaround time for beta‐2‐transferrin was < 24 h, suggesting in‐house capabilities or rapid access, which is atypical as most centers still reported a turnaround time of at least 1–3 days. High‐resolution CT was reported to be a common non‐confirmatory test for CSF rhinorrhea. CT imaging has been shown to provide reasonable sensitivity and can help localize the defect site, which can assist in subsequent surgical planning should surgical intervention be required. The provocative tilt test was also commonly used by respondents for identifying CSF rhinorrhea. However, the overall level of evidence on this maneuver is low. Depending on the defect site and leak flow rate, postoperative CSF leaks were ultimately reported to be managed either conservatively with LD placement and bed rest or more aggressively with urgent surgical exploration and revision. Overall, most respondents favored surgical exploration regardless of defect size. The rationale for this may be threefold: firstly, it provides confirmation of the presence of a leak. Secondly, it provides a clear and immediate resolution to the issue, thereby preventing long‐term complications. Third, many large defects are unlikely to respond to conservative measures and would require re‐repair regardless. This study also is the first to comprehensively evaluate various activity restrictions and their associated risk following ESBS. We observed that deep diving, followed by heavy lifting, strenuous activities, high‐altitude activities, nose blowing, and CPAP use were considered the most conservative restrictions.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^116KgUP7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis and treatment of rhinitis-associated conditions — cerebral spinal fluid leak: History includes unilateral clear discharge that is intermittent and increased with dependent head position, with recent surgery or trauma; exam may find clear discharge unilateral that may or may not be noted on exam; diagnostic testing is to test nasal discharge for beta 2 transferrin and if positive refer to otolaryngologist; treatment is for an otolaryngologist to evaluate whether there is need for surgical leak closure.

### Cerebrospinal fluid leak and meningitis associated with nasal continuous positive airway pressure therapy [^116JvUGt]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Clear rhinorrhea is a common symptom in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and may worsen with continuous positive airway pressure therapy. Clear rhinorrhea can also be the presenting symptom of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, which is evidence of a communication between the subarachnoid space and the nasal cavity or sinuses. While CSF leak has been reported to occur with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) therapy following trauma to the skull base, its association with OSA and nCPAP therapy in the absence of trauma has not been previously described. We report two patients with OSA in whom CSF leak developed following the institution of nCPAP therapy. In one patient, the rhinorrhea was complicated by meningitis. Both patients underwent successful repair of their defects. One patient successfully restarted nCPAP therapy, while the other refused it.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea is a rare clinical condition. Most leaks either are caused by traumatic head injury or are a complication of surgical procedures on the base of the skull. CSF rhinorrhea from nasal tube placement has been reported previously. We report a case of nasal thermometer placement during anesthesia complicated by a CSF leakage. We reemphasize that any material — including thermometers, nasogastric tubes, and endotracheal tubes — should be directed posteriorly after introduction into the external naris.

### Development and clinical validation of a hook effect-based lateral flow immunoassay sensor for cerebrospinal fluid leak detection [^1125MBAh]. Neurosurgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a colorless liquid from the brain and spinal cordthat serves multiple functions including nutritional, waste removal, and cushioning. - A CSF leak can occur through the nose or ear canal iatrogenically or traumatically - and can occur spontaneously, intraoperatively, or postoperatively after spinal and cranial surgery. - A CSF leak that occurs postoperatively, particularly after lumbar and skull surgery, can result in low pressure headaches, meningitis, and central nervous system infections. Therefore, a rapid and accurate method to detect the presence of postoperative CSF leak is essential for timely treatment of such conditions.

Symptoms of CSF leak are often confused with migraine or other cerebrospinal disorders, and it is not easy to diagnose. Migraine and CSF leak can have overlapping symptoms such as headaches, nausea, and sensitivity to light or sound, causing diagnostic errors. Currently, the gold standard for the detection of CSF in a fluid sample is gel electrophoresis, which is costly, time-consuming, and requires expensive equipment and expert training. - Recently, in the pursuit of a rapid and simple CSF leak diagnostic, several groups have started to study an asialo-transferrin (beta2-transferrin, β2TF), which is specifically found in CSF. - β2TF is a modified glycoprotein from a sialo-transferrin through brain neuraminidase in the CSF. This enzyme eliminates terminal sialic acid residues on the glycan chains of transferrin (TF), resulting in β2TF constituting up to 30% of total TF in CSF. However, anti-TF antibodies can barely distinguish β2TF from sialo-transferrin because the amount present is relatively low and the chemical structure derived from the enzyme has high similarity. There are only a few studies of CSF leak diagnosis using anti-β2TF antibodies -; however, they suffer from limitations in terms of assay time, sensitivity, and specificity which are insufficient for point-of-care (POC) diagnosis.

### The spontaneous escape of cerebrospinal fluid through the nose… [^113izuNy]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The patient who, without warning, suddenly develops a discharge of cerebrospinal fluid from the nose should at once be considered a "brain tumor suspect. "1 In cerebrospinal rhinorrhea the liquid is usually clear, does not stain the handkerchief, and flows more freely when the head is inclined forward. In the recumbent position, the tasteless fluid may run into the pharynx, the patient being unaware of its presence. The amount of fluid discharged in twenty-four hours varies from 50 to more than 1, 000 c. c., and by the usual tests it shows no variations from the fluid obtained by spinal puncture. The discharge may be either continuous or intermittent. When intermittent, the onset of the rhinorrhea may be accompanied by relief from signs and symptoms of intracranial pressure. The patient who, without warning, suddenly develops a discharge of opinion among previous authors concerning the underlying cause of spontaneous cerebrospinal rhinorrhea and concerning LOCKE CE.

A morbidly obese 50-year-old woman presented with two episodes of septic meningitis over a 4-month period. The patient admitted having a watery discharge from her right naris for a year; she could not recall a history of head trauma. The glucose level of the discharge was 65 mg/dl. The authors diagnosed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhoea. A second inspection of the brain CT showed flattening of the pituitary gland suggestive of empty sella, and a right posterior wall sphenoid sinus defect. Our patient had many features suggestive of spontaneous nasal CSF leak. Elevated intracranial pressure is a common finding; it increases the hydrostatic forces exerted at anatomically weakened sites of the skull and eventually produces a bone defect. Endoscopic exploration of the sphenoid sinus showed a bony defect which was repaired. When the patient was last seen 6 months after her surgery, she was doing well and her rhinorrhoea had stopped.

Rhinorrhoea and otorrhoea

CSF leakage from the nose is defined as rhinorrhoea, while leakage from the ear is called otorrhoea. CSF leakages may be traumatic, non-traumatic or spontaneous in origin, but the evaluation algorithm is the same for all three subtypes. In all patients the first step is identifying the presence of β-2 transferrin in order to make a certain diagnosis (Fig. 11). Thin-section CT images are beneficial in the evaluation of traumatic CSF leakages. However, CT is usually inadequate in cases with multiple fractures and intermittent-low flow fistulas. CT or radionuclide cisternography are not sufficient for low-flow or hair-like leakages either. The most important drawback of these methods is their invasive nature and radiation exposure. These limitations are overcome in non-contrast MR cisternography (NCE-MRC). Nevertheless, false-positive result rates are high with these methods because of viscous secretions and susceptibility artefacts. CE-MRC may be beneficial in equivocal cases.

Fig. 11
A 32-year-old male patient with rhinorrhoea and a history of trauma. Electrophoresis study (A) shows no beta-2-transferrin in the blood sample assigned as no. 1, whereas in the columns assigned as 2 (CSF) and 3 (nasal sample) beta-2-transferrin is demonstrated (arrows). Coronal precontrast fat-saturated T1W images cannot precisely locate the level of CSF leakage (B). After intrathecal Gd-DTPA administration, postcontrast T1W image obtained with the same parameters clearly demonstrates the leakage into the left frontal sinus (arrow, C)

Intracranial hypotension

Intracranial hypotension is a disease characterised by orthostatic headaches. The cardinal finding is increased intracranial blood volume. Characteristic MRI findings are thickened pachymeninges with contrast enhancement, subdural fluid collections, engorged cerebral veins, rounded dural sinuses, brain sagging, disappearance of the CSF space of the optic nerve sheath and an inferiorly displaced midbrain. These findings are also useful in the follow-up period after treatment. Identifying the presence and location of the CSF leakage is required for a precise diagnosis and accurate management. NCE-MRC obtained with heavily T2W sequences showing the extra-arachnoid fluid may provide additive data by demonstrating meningeal diverticula, high-flow fistulas and/or engorgement of the epidural venous plexus. In equivocal cases, CE-MRC is more sensitive than other methods in demonstrating the leakage location.

### Delayed diagnosis and treatment of cerebrospinal fluid leakage in current practice [^113mMf7e]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

As delayed diagnosis and treatment of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage are common in current practice, this study was performed to determine associated factors and discuss appropriate strategies to deal with these problems. A retrospective analysis of all cases of CSF leakage in our hospital from 2007 to 2018, including 41 patients with CSF rhinorrhea and 5 with CSF otorhinorrhea, was performed. Symptoms, associated diseases, misdiagnoses, history of skull base repair surgical, previous medical costs, and number of hospital visits before visiting our institution were reviewed. The diagnoses, surgical reconstruction methods, and prognoses of the patients were analyzed. In 18 patients, CSF leakage was spontaneous, in 14 the cause was trauma, and in the remaining 14 the origin was iatrogenic. Twelve patients had been misdiagnosed with allergic rhinitis, rhinosinusitis, or otitis media. Twelve cases had intracranial infection and 14 suffered airway infection. Six had undergone unsuccessful craniotomy, endonasal endoscopic surgery, or ear surgery for treatment of CSF leakage before visiting our institute. This resulted in an average of 5.13 ± 1.32 referrals and medical costs of up to 20,795.7 ± 4553.80 RMB. The success rate was 97.83% after repairing CSF fistulae in our hospital. The septal floor flap (SFF) method (based on ethmoidal arteries) to treat CSF rhinorrhea showed a success rate of 100% in 12 patients. Therefore, early localization, clinical diagnosis, and appropriate repair surgery can avoid the occurrence of delayed events. Pedicled flaps, including SFF, are recommended to manage challenging CSF rhinorrhea.

### Evaluating the efficacy of topical intranasal fluorescein for localizing CSF rhinorrhea: a systematic review [^116k7zL4]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess existing literature on topical intranasal fluorescein (TINF) for the diagnosis and localization of nasal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

Study Design

Systematic review.

Methods

A 6-database literature search was conducted to identify articles providing insight into TINF for the diagnosis and treatment of sinonasal CSF leak. Demographic characteristics, technical details, efficacy, and safety data were extracted and analyzed. Methodological quality was assessed using Methodological Items for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) criteria.

Results

All studies reported a diagnostic accuracy rate ≥ 96%. There were no major complications reported for any patient (n = 99) with either 5% or 10% fluorescein use. The MINORS instrument of methodological quality indicated that the assessed studies were of moderate quality (7.29 out of a maximum score of 24).

Conclusion

This systematic review indicates that TINF is an easy, safe, inexpensive, and sensitive approach for the diagnosis and treatment of sinonasal CSF leakage. For these reasons, it may be especially well suited for resource-limited clinical scenarios.

### Spontaneous CSF leaks [^112rErSH]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea represents a distinct clinic entity that is likely a variant of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Patients with spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks are generally middle-aged obese women with radiographic evidence of skull base defects, associated meningoencephaloceles, and empty sella syndrome, a common sign of increased intracranial pressure. Significant overlap exists in the characteristics of patients with spontaneous CSF leak and IIH. Endoscopic repair of the CSF fistula is the gold standard treatment for this condition, but emerging evidence supports the reduction of CSF pressure as an important adjuvant treatment in this patient population.

### Postoperative low-flow cerebrospinal fluid leak of endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenoma – wait and see, or lumbar drain? [^117BVTrh]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Postoperative Management

Patients were instructed to rest with their head elevated about 15° and to avoid any activity that might raise intracranial pressure, such as straining or nose blowing. Nasal packing was generally removed endoscopically 1 to 3 days after surgery. The third-generation antibiotic was continued for 3 to 7 days postoperatively. Leakage from nostrils was monitored for both group of patients, TES-tape (Eli Lilly and Co. Indianapolis, IN) was applied to inform CSF leaks for patient who experienced rhinorrhea. Based on whether LD was used, patients who developed CSF leakage postoperatively were classified into 2 categories as follows, lumbar drained group (LD group) and conservatively treated group (control group). Endoscopic repair of skull base was performed in patient whose CSF leak persisted over 7 days in each group.

Statistical Methods

Statistical comparisons between the 2 groups were made using Chi-squared analysis for categorical variables and Student t test for continuous variables. Two-tailed tests were performed for each scenario, and the differences were considered statistically significant if the P value was less than 0.05. Data were analyzed using SPSS 19.0 (IBM Corp).

Early cerebrospinal fluid leakage sign

Case 10 was considered to have symptomatic CSF leakage after tampon removal, as the bilateral nasal septal mucosa was compressed by the nasal packing, despite the CSF leakage appearing at extubation due to bucking. Thus, the presence of submucosal nasal or intrasphenoidal sinus CSF-like accumulation on immediate postoperative CT may indicate an early CSF leakage. Similarly, in Cases 8 and 9, in which CSF leakage symptoms appeared earlier, CSF accumulation was suspected under the nasal mucosa and within the sphenoid sinus on immediate postoperative CT (Fig. 3 b-ⅰ–ⅳ). In contrast, Case 7, which developed delayed CSF leakage following tumor shrinkage due to chemotherapy, did not exhibit these finding (Fig. 3 b-ⅴ,ⅵ).

### Cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea: diagnosis and management [^111igSD1]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Advances in imaging and endoscopic techniques have improved the ability to diagnose, localize, and treat in a less morbid fashion CSF leaks of the anterior skull base. An appreciation for the mechanism of leak and of the relationship between CSF production and absorption must be kept in mind when individualizing a repair. Increased CSF pressure caused by overproduction or underabsorption may result in persistence of a leak despite one's best efforts. Numerous advances in dural replacement grafts and tissue sealants have improved the ability to achieve watertight closure of the cranial vault. Microvascular techniques have allowed larger defects previously not reconstructable to be handled with relative ease by trained personnel. With expanded reconstructive techniques, the ability to handle larger disease processes of the skull base continues to expand.

### Recurrent Streptococcus pneumoniae 23 F meningitis due to cerebrospinal fluid leakage from the ear cannel: a case report [^115PzMVJ]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

To test for CSF leakage, clinician may test the ear or nose drainage for beta-2 transferrin, a desialylated form of the protein transferring, which is almost exclusively found only in CSF. Therefore, to localization of the fistula may require diagnostic imaging studies. Nuclear medicine examination (Radioisotope cisternography) or fluorescein dye study via lumbar puncture should be considered to identify the location of leakage. In our case report, radioisotope cisternography combined with HRCT (1-mm section) and MRI appeared helpful to identify the location. From this case report, we found that recurrent bacteria meningitis is critical and should be prompt a search for an underline immunologic or anatomic defect. CSF leakage is common to cause misdiagnosis or failure to make a timely early diagnosis, which means that suitable treatment may be delayed. Better knowledge of the possible sites and pathways of fistulas (even rare ones) is necessary. The different pathways of spontaneous CSF leakage should be clearly understood and carefully examined by the radiologists and primary clinicians. Congenital inner ear malformation is an uncommon fistula route, which can be misdiagnosed even regular CT (usually cut every 5 mm) is performed without performed high resolution CT (usually cut every 1 mm). The treatment for this congenital fistula is based on filling of the bone pathway, which can be repaired with biometerials.

### Expanding the clinical spectrum of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^114do843]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

SPONTANEOUS SKULL BASE CEREBROSPINAL FLUID LEAK

Spontaneous skull base CSF leak presenting with rhinorrhea, headache, and recurrent meningitis is an unusual presentation that is strongly associated with IIH. A striking overlap exists in the demographic, clinical, and radiological characteristics of patients with IIH and those with spontaneous CSF leaks. Like IIH, rates of spontaneous CSF leak have increased in parallel with the obesity epidemic. Both conditions mainly affect women. However, patients with spontaneous CSF leak are older than IIH patients and experience fewer headaches and pulsatile tinnitus, perhaps because CSF leak acts as a 'pressure release valve' against raised ICP, relieving the signs and symptoms of IIH and delaying its presentation. RAD-IH are frequently detected in patients with spontaneous CSF leak, in particular empty sella, meningoceles and encephaloceles. Meningoceles and encephaloceles are highly prevalent in patients with spontaneous CSF leak and typically occur in the anterior cranial fossa, while in IIH, they usually involve Meckel cave or the petrous apex.

The pathophysiology of spontaneous CSF leak is not fully understood but likely overlaps with the mechanisms that give rise to IIH. It is hypothesized that patients with spontaneous CSF leak may have a predisposition to abnormally thin or weak skull base bones, which is further exacerbated by raised ICP. Spontaneous CSF leak frequently involves the anterior skull base, particularly the cribriform plate in the ethmoid bone and the lateral recess of the sphenoid sinus. The cribriform plate is anatomically vulnerable to raised ICP because of the presence of numerous foramina for the passage of the olfactory nerves, while pneumatization of the paranasal sinuses by raised ICP may weaken the sphenoid roof, predisposing to osseous erosion and spontaneous CSF leak. Related to this is the hypothesis that IIH is a disorder of imbalanced glymphatic flow, with congestion of the glymphatic system leading to overflow of the lymphatic CSF outflow pathway. This pathway includes the sheaths of the cranial nerves joining the deep cervical lymph nodes. Chronic congestion of the lymphatic CSF as it travels through the sheaths of the cranial nerves, around the olfactory bulb, is thought to contribute to erosion of the cribriform plate.

Search Strategy

Databases searched: MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE via Ovid, and Cochrane Library via Central databases were searched during the selection process (end‐of‐search date: April 2024).

The search strategy was developed with the guidance of a Clinical Librarian and included the following search terms:

(((((csf) OR ((cerebrospinal) AND (fluid))) AND (leak)) AND (spontaneous)) OR (meningocele) OR (encephalocele) OR (meningoencephalocele) OR ((spontaneous) AND (otorrh?ea))) AND (((lateral) AND (skull) AND (base)) OR ((temporal) AND (bone)) OR ((middle) AND (cranial) AND (fossa)))).

Snowball sampling was performed on the references of the included studies. Detailed search strategy for Ovid can be found in Supplemental Figure S1, available online. Two reviewers independently screened abstracts and subsequently full texts using the online COVIDENCE platform (Covidence systematic review software, Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia; available at). Disagreements were resolved by discussion, and if required arbitration by a third reviewer.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently extracted relevant data through a standardized data extraction template. Any conflicts were resolved through discussion and consultation with a third reviewer. Data extracted included the following: (i) study characteristics (first author, year of publication, study design, and number of patients), (ii) patient characteristics (age, body mass index [BMI], sex, follow‐up, revision surgery, readmission, and type of surgical repair/approach), (iii) primary outcomes (recurrence, complications), and (iv) secondary outcomes (LOS, revision surgery).

Quality of Evidence Assessment

Quality of included studies was assessed employing the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLB) Assessment Tool for case‐control studies (12 criteria), observational cohort and cross‐sectional studies (14 criteria), and case series studies (9 criteria). Studies were classified as poor, fair, or good quality for each item of the assessment tool. There is no specific score threshold that would categorize a study as poor, fair, or good; thus, the assessment was subjective, and any discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer. Before the quality assessment stage, it was decided that "poor" studies would be excluded.

### Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea as the presenting symptom of sellar pathologies: three demonstrative cases [^114SacXo]. Neurosurgical Review (2007). Low credibility.

Spontaneous rhinorrhea due to sellar pathologies is a rare and insidious disease that may represent a diagnostic challenge. Since the precipitating cause is not apparent in most patients, delayed diagnosis and/or improper treatments are not uncommon and may be detrimental for the patients. The precise mechanisms of such rhinorrhea are still incompletely understood. Proposed etiological factors include constant cerebrospinal fluid pulsations against the anterior skull base transmitted by primitive or acquired arachnoid invaginations in combination with either elevated ICP or congenital/pathologic erosions of sellar and parasellar bone structures. Advances in the diagnosis and surgical techniques have recently modified the decision-making approach to this pathology. The present paper reports three unusual cases of sellar pathologies revealed by rhinorrhea as the first symptom discussing controversial issues on pathogenesis, complications and current management of this kind of fistula.

### Using ipratropium bromide nasal spray response as a screening tool in the diagnostic workup of cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea [^115g9Kvs]. The Laryngoscope (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Unilateral clear thin rhinorrhea (UCTR) can be concerning for a nasal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. Beta-2 transferrin electrophoresis has been the gold standard for initial non-invasive confirmatory testing for CSF rhinorrhea, but there can be issues with fluid collection and testing errors. Ipratropium bromide nasal spray (IBNS) is highly effective at reducing rhinitis-related rhinorrhea, and should presumably not resolve CSF rhinorrhea. This study assessed whether different clinical features and IBNS response helped predict presence or absence of CSF rhinorrhea.

Methods

A prospective cohort study was conducted where all patients with UCTR had nasal fluid tested for beta-2 transferrin, and were prescribed 0.06% IBNS. Patients were diagnosed with CSF rhinorrhea or other rhinologic conditions. Clinical variables like IBNS response (rhinorrhea reduction), positional worsening, salty taste, postoperative state, female gender, and body-mass index were assessed for their ability to predict CSF rhinorrhea. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values and odds ratios were calculated for all clinical variables.

Results

Twenty patients had CSF rhinorrhea, and 53 had non-CSF etiologies. Amongst clinical variables assessed for predicting CSF absence or presence, significant associations were shown for IBNS response (OR = 844.66, p = 0.001), positional rhinorrhea worsening (OR = 8.22, p = 0.049), and body-mass index ≥ 30 (OR = 2.92, p = 0.048). IBNS response demonstrated 96% sensitivity and 100% specificity, and 100% positive and 91% negative predictive values for predicting CSF rhinorrhea.

Conclusions

In patients with UCTR, 0.06% IBNS response is an excellent screening tool for excluding CSF rhinorrhea, and should be considered in the diagnostic workup of CSF rhinorrhea.

### Extraordinary complication of COVID-19 swab testing: CSF rhinorrhea [^1171qXXc]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious disease that has reached pandemic status. The diagnosis of COVID-19 is made using the polymerase chain reaction test to evaluate a swab taken from the naso/oro-pharyngeal area. Since COVID-19 is still a pandemic, it is thought that the use of this diagnostic test will be on the agenda for a while. A patient with COVID-19 symptoms presented with unilateral cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea after a nasopharyngeal swab test. Although nasopharyngeal swabs are taken very frequently, the complication rate is very low. However, life-threatening complications can be observed on rare occasions, and care should be taken.

### Systematic review: evaluating the efficacy of intrathecal fluorescein for localizing cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea [^1146sRr3]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

A defect in the skull base can result in leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) out of the subarachnoid space into the sinonasal cavities, termed CSF rhinorrhea. Patients presenting with CSF rhinorrhea often require surgical repair, typically performed endoscopically. Successful surgical intervention is highly reliant on accurate identification of the leak site. Identification can be enhanced by the administration of intrathecal fluorescein (IF) via a lumbar drain before surgery. The objective of this systematic review is to better characterize the benefits and limitations of IF administration.

Methods

A systematic search was conducted for literature documenting the use of IF for CSF leak localization. The results of this search were subjected to initial review, followed by full-text evaluation of selected texts, and final inclusion based on predetermined selection criteria. Primary outcomes were specificity and sensitivity of IF administration in identifying CSF leak sites. Secondary outcomes included administration technique and safety data.

Results

A total of 25 studies representing 3801 instances of IF administration met inclusion criteria. When injected slowly for up to 30 minutes at doses of < 50 mg, IF administration results in minimal complications. A total of 25 mg doses (92.36%) of IF appear more sensitive than 10 mg (71.88%) doses of IF while maintaining a similar safety profile. Mixing fluorescein with double distilled water instead of CSF or saline may decrease waiting times before fluorescein can be identified and increase its safety profile.

Conclusions

Intrathecal fluorescein may play an important role in the identification of CSF leak site during endoscopic repair.

### A novel nasal endoscopy-assisted method for sealing cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea [^113EWcQS]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

One of the most common complications of trans-sphenoidal surgery is CSF leakage. The success rate of conservative management of dural defects is only 50%. Patients need to rest in bed for a certain period of time to avoid high intra-abdominal pressure, prophylactic antibiotic therapy, and are prohibited from nose blowing sneezing with the mouth closed. Blowing their nose. Some scholars suggest conservative treatment for 4 to 10 days, whereas others suggest conservative treatment for 2 to 6 weeks. Previous studies have shown that ~90% of patients with CSF leaks require surgical treatment. In most cases, the endoscopic endonasal approach is preferred, and in a few cases, open surgical repair is required through craniotomy. However, especially for early CSF rhinorrhea, it would be a confusing choice to adopt ineffective conservative treatment or to perform traumatic repair.

Multiple types of graft material have been proposed in the literature. Some neurosurgeons advocate the routine use of autologous tissues such as fat, muscle, fascia, cartilage, or bone to reconstruct the sella turcica after trans-sphenoidal surgery to prevent postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Synthetic materials, including polyester-silicone dural substitute, Vicryl patches, and a combination of fibrin sealant/collagen fleece, can also be used to fill the sella turcica after tumor resection. Nevertheless, the fat and fascia used to repair the leaks are taken from the abdomen or lateral thigh, which are traumatic and costly. Autologous grafting typically requires a separate incision, prolonging the surgical time, causing additional discomfort to the patient, and resulting in abdominal and thigh scars, which can affect aesthetics. Therefore, a novel approach should be designed to achieve effective healing while avoiding traumatic surgery.

### A novel nasal endoscopy-assisted method for sealing cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea [^111QCNdp]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Although the surgical technique of trans-sphenoidal resection of pituitary tumors has made great progress in the past decade, the postoperative complication rate still exceeds 20%. Continuous cerebrospinal fluid leakage can affect the daily life of patients and may also cause serious complications, increasing the risk of death. The main manifestation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea is the clear and non-coagulated liquid flowing out of the nasal cavity. Delayed CSF leakage and lack of effective leak repair methods are important causes of CSF rhinorrhea. Early repair of leaks through nasal endoscopy or craniotomy is an effective method for treating cerebrospinal fluid leakage and reducing complications of meningitis. Previous studies have recommended trans-sphenoidal surgery as the initial treatment for repairing CSF leakage. Fascia grafts and/or fat obtained from the patient's thighs or abdomen are effective materials for repairing CSF leaks. However, the above-mentioned surgery for repairing cerebrospinal fluid leakage requires general anesthesia, which increases the economic burden on the patients, and the postoperative recovery time is relatively long. In this article, we report 1 case suffering from early CSF rhinorrhea, in which a novel method was applied to seal leakage with the help of nasal endoscopy.

Following surgery involving skull base repair for pituitary tumors, 49 (38.3%) would admit patients to the intensive care unit (ICU). On the other hand, following surgery involving skull base repair for large defects with intradural dissection, 102 (79.7%) would admit patients to the ICU. Postoperative imaging protocols are summarized in Figure 1. Postoperative antiemetics were prescribed by a total of 73.2% of respondents. Postoperative antibiotics were prescribed by 87.4% of respondents with the following duration: < 2 days (27.6%), 3–5 days (15.7%), 5–10 days (31.5%), 11–14 days (11.8%), or > 14 days (0.8%). The perspective of the respondents on suspicious signs and symptoms for postoperative CSF leak is demonstrated in Figure 2. Notably, the most suspicious signs of CSF leak were meningitis and dependent clear fluid rhinorrhea. If a postoperative CSF leak was suspected, workup included beta‐2‐transferrin testing (70.8%), CT scan (63.1%), provocative tilt to assess for dependent rhinorrhea (58.5%), endoscopy to assess the repair site (55.4%), MRI (10.8%), and beta trace protein testing (5.4%). If provocative tilt tests are performed, respondents felt comfortable with tilting immediately postoperatively (14.4%) or after 1–3 days (34.4%), 3–7 days (33.8%), or 7 days postoperatively (16.0%). Turnaround time for beta‐2‐transferrin for respondents was < 24 h (19.2%), 1–3 days (54.4%), and > 3 days (26.4%). In case the patient requires positive pressure ventilation after skull base repair, precautions such as the use of nasal trumpets (26.2%), rapid sequence intubation (72.3%), and/or awake intubation (14.6%) were taken. Postoperative CSF leaks mostly happened during postop Day 0–3 (42.1%), 3–7 (42.9%), or > 7 days (15.1%). After skull base repair, patients were first seen in clinic (75.6%) or underwent in‐office debridement (57.9%) within 2 weeks of time. Furthermore, of the 116 respondents who used nasal packing, 78.6% removed packing within 2 weeks of surgery. In comparing when closure was done by ENT alone (N = 56) versus both ENT and neurosurgery (N = 44), there was no significant difference (p ‐value > 0.05) in rates of using autologous material, tissue glue/sealant, lumbar drain, or various techniques for the primary closure of diaphragma tear, transtuberculum or transplanum defects, large transcribriform defects, posterior cranial fossa defects, or posterior table of frontal sinus defects. Furthermore, there was no difference in methods (or lack of) intraoperative testing of repair integrity.

### Sinonasal cerebrospinal fluid leaks: management of 97 patients over 10 years [^111Bs3qC]. The Laryngoscope (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

Although endoscopic closure is now the treatment of choice in the majority of patients with sinonasal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks, there is a recurrence rate of up to 10% in most series.

Objectives

Our aim was to review our experience in the management of CSF leaks and in particular the cause of recurrent leaks.

Methods

We prospectively collected data on all cases referred as a suspected CSF leak to us, a tertiary referral center, over a 10 year period between 1994 and 2004.

Results

The 121 patients referred with an apparent CSF leak had a mean age of 51 (range 2–87) years. Fifty-three percent were male, and 47% were female. In 24 cases, investigations revealed that there was in fact no CSF leak, and in 17 posttraumatic cases, the leak ceased spontaneously. Twenty-nine patients had a spontaneous CSF leak. Of the 80 cases surgically repaired, 72 had an endoscopic approach, with a success rate of 90%, increasing to 97% after a second procedure and 99% by a third procedure. Eight patients with a posterior wall frontal sinus leak underwent an external frontal sinus procedure. There were 8 failures, and 6 occurred in the 13 patients with a spontaneous leak and evidence of raised intracranial pressure (ICP).

Conclusions

In conclusion, our endoscopic repair rate for sinonasal CSF leaks are good and compare well with the standards in the literature. Raised ICP is the most common reason for recurrent CSF leak after repair. Patients with a spontaneous CSF leak and evidence of raised ICP had a 46% failure rate. When consenting such patients for surgery, they must be informed of the lower success rate and that they may need additional procedures, including shunting.

### Rapid spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak detected in the gastrointestinal tract [^1111RhAJ]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

There are many causes of cerebrospinal (CSF) leaks. Most cases are secondary to blunt trauma and iatrogenic trauma caused by postoperative sequelae. Occasionally, CSF leakage may occur from nontraumatic or "spontaneous" causes, such as benign intracranial hypertension and "empty sella syndrome". Mass effect due to an encephalocele or meningocele may also be seen. Radionuclide cisternography is a sensitive method of determining CSF leak when combined with intranasal cotton pledget placement and analysis. We present a spontaneous CSF fluid leak that was detected when scintigraphic activity appeared first in the gastrointestinal tract.

### Skull base cerebrospinal fluid fistula: a novel detection method based on two-dimensional electrophoresis [^1129rh5d]. Head & Neck (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The detection of the presence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in nasal secretions contaminated with blood and mucus remains a challenging clinical problem.

Methods

A prospective study was conducted from November 1998 to February 2002, including 42 patients. Samples (250 microL) of nasal secretions were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). Plasma, mucus, and CSF were identified by specific proteins markers corresponding to characteristic trains of spots. Intrathecal injection of fluorescein followed by the detection of fluorescein on endoscopic examination of the nasal cavities was considered a positive reference for CSF rhinorrhea.

Results

In all cases of positive fluorescein test, we unambiguously observed the presence of several specific CSF markers onto the 2-DE gels. Conversely, all negative fluorescein tests were associated with the absence of CSF-specific spots.

Conclusions

Two-DE analyses of biologic fluids of nasal origin should be considered as a reliable diagnostic tool in case of suspicion of CSF leak.

### Unexpected cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea after a spinal anesthesia [^117RLkxK]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

A 47-year-old woman presented with a left-sided watery nasal discharge persisting for 3 weeks after an orthopedic operation using spinal anesthesia. The testing of the nasal fluid for β-2 transferrin confirmed that the leakage was cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The computed tomographic cisternography revealed a left-sided bone defect in the cribriform plate. Endonasal approach was performed for closing the defect. At 3-month follow-up, CSF rhinorrhea had not recurred. In this report, we present an unexpected CSF rhinorrhea after a spinal anesthesia and discuss the reason of spontaneous leak after spinal anesthesia, as well as discuss current diagnosis and management of CSF rhinorrhea with the composite graft.

### Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea as the initial presentation of growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma [^112k6ftz]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2010). Low credibility.

Patients with acromegaly usually present with characteristic clinical features or comorbidities associated with excess insulinlike growth factor 1 (IGF-1)/growth hormone (GH) or may come to medical attention secondary to mass effects causing visual field distortions. Herein, we report a case of spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea as the presenting symptom of acromegaly. A 68-year-old man presented to an outside facility with a 2-day history of headache associated with nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and clear nasal discharge and underwent 2 attempted repairs of a sphenoid sinus CSF leak. Examination on admission to our hospital was significant for fluctuating level of consciousness. Subsequently, subtle coarse facial features were appreciated. Pituitary function testing showed thyrotropin and gonadotropin deficiencies along with an elevated age- and sex-matched IGF-1 of 285 (normal level, 59–225 ng/mL). Nadir GH during oral glucose tolerance test was 5.5 ng/mL and confirmed the diagnosis of acromegaly. Magnetic resonance imaging showed pneumocephalus, an enlarged sella with an elongated pituitary stalk, and partial erosion of the anterior wall of the sphenoid sinus. A distinct adenoma could not be identified. An endoscopic, transnasal, transsphenoidal exploration and biopsy with multilayered skull base reconstruction were performed. Histologic examination of the biopsy contents was consistent with a GH-producing adenoma. Postoperatively, the patient's fluctuating level of consciousness improved and returned to baseline after his successful skull base repair. During the follow-up period, he had an IGF-1 of 713 ng/mL and started treatment with a somatostatin analogue. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a GH-producing pituitary adenoma presenting with spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea. Pituitary adenomas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea with abnormal sellar image, and these patients should undergo a thorough hormonal evaluation.

### Topical intranasal fluorescein to localize a cerebrospinal fluid leak: a demonstration [^113dqcfs]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Intrathecal fluorescein is commonly used to localize cerebrospinal fluid leaks. This technique is invasive and associated with several potential adverse effects. The purpose of this video presentation is to demonstrate an alternative technique, the intranasal use of dilute topical fluorescein, to localize a cerebrospinal fluid leak intraoperatively.

Methods

A 45-year-old male with a history of benign intracranial hypertension and 2 months of right-sided rhinorrhea underwent surgical repair of a cerebrospinal fluid leak. Topical fluorescein was applied intraoperatively to localize the defect.

Results

At 1- and 3-month follow-ups the patient was without cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea and the middle turbinate flap was intact.

Conclusion

Topical application of dilute intranasal fluorescein is a feasible and efficient tool for localizing cerebrospinal fluid leaks.

### Lack of causal association between spontaneous intracranial hypotension and cranial cerebrospinal fluid leaks [^115gzc61]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2012). Low credibility.

Object

Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is an important cause of headaches and an underlying spinal CSF leak can be demonstrated in most patients. Whether CSF leaks at the level of the skull base can cause spontaneous intracranial hypotension remains a matter of controversy. The authors' aim was to examine the frequency of skull base CSF leaks as the cause of spontaneous intracranial hypotension.

Methods

Demographic, clinical, and radiological data were collected from a consecutive group of patients evaluated for spontaneous intracranial hypotension during a 9-year period.

Results

Among 273 patients who met the diagnostic criteria for spontaneous intracranial hypotension and 42 who did not, not a single instance of CSF leak at the skull base was encountered. Clear nasal drainage was reported by 41 patients, but a diagnosis of CSF rhinorrhea could not be established. Four patients underwent exploratory surgery for presumed CSF rhinorrhea. In addition, the authors treated 3 patients who had a postoperative CSF leak at the skull base following the resection of a cerebellopontine angle tumor and developed orthostatic headaches; spinal imaging, however, demonstrated the presence of a spinal source of CSF leakage in all 3 patients.

Conclusions

There is no evidence for an association between spontaneous intracranial hypotension and CSF leaks at the level of the skull base. Moreover, the authors' study suggests that a spinal source for CSF leakage should even be suspected in patients with orthostatic headaches who have a documented skull base CSF leak.

### Posttraumatic pseudo-cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea [^117Fuh85]. Otology & Neurotology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective and Hypothesis

Posttraumatic clear rhinorrhea should result in immediate concern for a suspected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistula in patients with skull base injuries, including surgical trauma. However, in addition to CSF rhinorrhea, the differential diagnosis may also include postinjury autonomic dysfunction. Pseudo-cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea (PCSFR) is a term used to describe rhinorrhea resulting from injury to preganglionic parasympathetic fibers supplying the sphenopalatine ganglion. This ganglion plays a critical role in this pathway secondary to its anatomic course and physiologic function. Differentiating between PCSFR and true CSF rhinorrhea can be a diagnostic challenge and may result in unnecessary and costly invasive testing and treatment.

Case Study

The authors present an illustrative case of noniatrogenic posttraumatic PCSFR in a previously healthy patient who experienced a head injury in a horseback riding accident.

Discussion

Features of PCSFR include a history of skull base surgery or trauma with involvement of autonomic structures in this region, rhinorrhea within months or years after injury, decreased lacrimation on the involved side, absence of clinical signs of meningitis, and a negative beta2-transferrin test result. Management of PCSFR is aimed at restoring the normal autonomic homeostasis in the nasal cavity. Treatment options include topical medicines such as anticholinergics and the various surgical procedures aimed at disruption of parasympathetic preganglionic fibers proximal to or at the sphenopalatine ganglion.

Conclusion

This case and its diagnosis and management provide an additional mechanism of PCSFR, a clinical entity that must be considered in the evaluation of all patients with previous skull base trauma.

### Posttraumatic delayed cranio-orbital cerebrospinal fluid leakage: case report [^114QPmEZ]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

A 56-year-old man sustained subarachnoid haemorrhage, skull base fracture and multiple facial fractures in a traffic accident. Two weeks later, the patient developed a subperiosteal fluid collection into the orbit of the right side presenting with a progressive proptosis and an increased intraocular pressure. We performed drainage of the fluid on the superior part of the right orbit, followed by a surgical reduction of the facial fractures. The patient had no exophthalmos any longer, whose intraocular pressure was normalised. In conclusion, our case indicates that careful monitoring of clinical signs and a follow-up radiography would be mandatory for patients with craniocerebral trauma despite a lack of the definite symptoms. Clinicians should consider the possibility that the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage into the orbit might occur in these patients.

### Topical intranasal fluorescein: the missing partner in algorithms of cerebrospinal fluid fistula detection [^115GEH8b]. The Laryngoscope (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this work was to focus on the development and validation of the use of topical fluorescein in the intraoperative localization of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistulas, and to screen its use in preoperative diagnosis of CSF rhinorrhea as well as postoperative detection of a recurrence.

Materials and Methods

Twenty-five patients with CSF rhinorrhea were treated with an endoscopic endonasal technique. Topical intranasal 5% fluorescein was used for preoperative diagnosis and intraoperative localization of the site of the leak. A change in the color of the fluorescein from yellow to green fluorescence and sometimes streaming the fluorescein over the nasal mucosa and blood denoted the presence of CSF, and the site of the leak could be traced.

Results

The cause of the leak was accidental trauma in 11 patients, spontaneous in 9 patients, and iatrogenic in 5 patients. The ethmoidal roof was the most common site of leak (52%) followed by the cribriform plate (40%) and then the sphenoid sinus (8%). We have achieved 100% success rate in sealing the CSF fistulas in our 25 patients with no recurrence detected during the follow-up period (mean, 19 ± 10 months). The preoperative use of fluorescein-soaked cotton pledgets was 100% accurate in diagnosing CSF rhinorrhea when compared with B2 transferrin testing. The intraoperative use of topical intranasal fluorescein was also 100% accurate in locating the site of the CSF fistula when compared with the surgical findings. No major complications have been reported.

Conclusion

In the presence of a clinically diagnosed CSF leakage, topical fluorescein is a very easy, sensitive, safe, and highly accurate tool in the intraoperative localization of the site and extent of CSF fistulas, and should be considered a viable noninvasive alternative to intrathecal fluorescein. We also recommend its use as a simple and quick outpatient clinic test for preoperative diagnosis of CSF rhinorrhea. It can be used postoperatively as well when there is a doubt of recurrence of the CSF leak.

### Beta-trace protein in ascites and pleural effusions: limits of CSF leakage detection [^115BYCW1]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2012). Low credibility.

Rhino- and/or otoliquorrhea can be diagnosed by detecting beta-trace protein (β-TP) in nasal or ear secretions, as β-TP is found in high concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) but not in serum. CSF fistulae following trauma or surgery can also occur at other anatomical sites, resulting in CSF leakage into the thoracic and abdominal cavities. By analogy, determination of ß-TP has also been used to diagnose CSF admixture in pleural effusions and ascites. However, no systematic study has yet evaluated the concentrations of β-TP in such fluids in the absence of CSF. To determine the validity of β-TP determination as a marker for the presence of CSF, we investigated β-TP concentrations in pleural effusions and ascites without CSF admixture. Patients from whom samples of ascites or pleural effusion and a paired plasma sample were available were investigated. One hundred sixty-four patients were prospectively recruited. ß-TP concentrations were determined by nephelometry. Mass spectrometric proteome analysis confirmed the presence of ß-TP in the samples. Median β-TP concentrations detected in ascites and pleural effusions (range, 0.014–26.5mg/L, median 2.29mg/L) exceeded the corresponding plasma concentrations 2.6-fold. According to cutoffs published to diagnose rhino- and otoliquorrhea, between 6.1% and 95.7% of the specimens would have been erroneously rated CSF-positive. Protein analysis confirmed the presence of β-TP in pleural effusion and ascites. Ascites and pleural effusion contain high concentrations of β-TP that exceed the levels in corresponding plasma. Therefore, β-TP is not a specific marker for the presence of CSF in these fluids.

### A systematic review of the endoscopic repair of cerebrospinal fluid leaks [^112Q2hFR]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To provide an up-to-date review of the literature on the safety and efficacy of the endoscopic technique for cerebrospinal (CSF) leak repairs.

Data Sources

PubMed, Medline/Old Medline, and Cochrane Central databases.

Review Methods

Using the above outlined data sources, studies involving the endoscopic repair of CSF leaks were reviewed independently by 2 researchers. Studies included met the following criteria: full-text article written in the English language, at least 5 human patients undergoing purely endoscopic surgical repair of a CSF leak, and documented follow-up. Data extracted included leak etiology, presentation and location, the use of imaging, intrathecal fluorescein, and adjunctive measures as well as the success rate of the repair.

Results

Fifty-five studies, involving 1778 fistulae repairs, were included for analysis. Spontaneous leaks were most prevalent, with the ethmoid roof and sphenoid the most common sites involved. The overall success rate of repair was high at 90% for primary and 97% for secondary repairs. A low complication rate of less than 0.03% was reported.

Conclusion

The endoscopic repair of CSF fistula is both safe and effective and should be considered the standard of care for most cases. Evidence supporting adjunctive measures such as lumbar drains and antibiotics remains limited despite their common use.

### Spontaneous skull base meningoencephaloceles and cerebrospinal fluid fistulas [^113mNV68]. Radiographics (2013). Low credibility.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistulas are characterized by the egress of CSF from the intracranial cavity through an osteodural disruption between the subarachnoid space and a pneumatized structure within the skull base. Depending on the cause, CSF fistulas are classified as acquired or congenital, and acquired fistulas are further classified as traumatic, nontraumatic, or spontaneous. Spontaneous CSF fistulas are considered to result from a multifactorial process and have been postulated to represent a variant of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. However, an anatomic predisposition involving thinning of the cranial base, such as pneumatization of the sinus walls, must also be present. This process creates areas of structural weakness that act as potential pathways for CSF leaks, which most commonly occur in the ethmoid roof, sphenoid sinus, and temporal bone. Because CSF leaks may be overlooked, a result of their asymptomatic or subtle, intermittent course, a high level of suspicion is crucial in making an early diagnosis. However, CSF fistulas may be well seen at computed tomography (CT), which depicts bone defects, and magnetic resonance cisternography, which reveals the contents of herniated tissue. Knowledge of the location and size of the bone defect and herniated contents is crucial for the selection of surgical approach and grafting material.

### Preliminary study on the stability of β-2 transferrin in extracorporeal cerebrospinal fluid [^115HunQ8]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Detection of beta-2 transferrin in rhinorrhea fluid is a sensitive and specific method for the diagnosis of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. Patients may be asked to collect this fluid at home to obtain an adequate volume for detection, and thus the age and storage conditions of these specimens may be variable upon analysis. The purpose of this study is to understand how age, storage temperature, and exposure to mucus affect the ability to detect beta-2 transferrin in CSF.

Study Design

Case series with planned data collection.

Setting

Tertiary care university hospital.

Subjects and Methods

This study consists of 6 patients undergoing endoscopic CSF leak repair. CSF was collected directly from a lumbar drain (n = 4) or from nasal drainage (n = 2). Specimens were stored at 4°C (n = 3) or room temperature (n = 3). Samples were tested for the presence of beta-2 transferrin for up to 7 days using standard immunofixation electrophoresis techniques.

Results

Beta-2 transferrin was detected in all specimens through day 7 regardless of storage temperature or collection site (95% exact binomial confidence interval of 0%-46%).

Conclusions

Beta-2 transferrin remains detectable in extracorporeal CSF for up to 7 days regardless of storage at room temperature or exposure to nasal mucus. Negative detection in patient specimens up to a week old is therefore not likely to be caused by protein degradation.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^1172H5kQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Rhinitis 2020 — diagnostic symptoms and phenotypes indicates that the diagnosis of rhinitis is suggested by the presence of 1 or more of the following symptoms: nasal congestion, rhinorrhea (anterior and posterior), sneezing, and itching; rhinitis can be classified by pathogenic mechanisms as allergic or nonallergic, some forms of nonallergic rhinitis such as vasomotor rhinitis (VMR) or atrophic rhinitis may not be associated with inflammation of the nasal mucosa, and recognition of whether a patient has AR or NAR or another mimicking condition is important because management will differ; conditions with overlapping symptoms include rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps, cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, ciliary dyskinesia syndrome, and structural/mechanical factors such as congenital anomalies, deviated septum, and pharyngeal reflux.

### Morbidity of multimodal treatments including endoscopic surgery for sinonasal malignancies: results of an international collaborative study on 940 patients (MUSES) [^113xnMsb]. Head & Neck (2025). Medium credibility.

Together with CSF leak, failure of SB reconstruction can also lead to two other early complications: pneumocephalus and brain herniation. The presence of intracranial air after ERTC is a relatively common finding on postoperative imaging studies with a prevalence of over 40%. In the majority of cases, this event is asymptomatic and benign (consequent to the entry of air during the surgical procedure), although it can be a warning sign for dural reconstruction failure and CSF leak. A retrospective study on 256 endoscopic anterior skull base surgery cases with dural opening showed that a frontal or intraventricular pneumocephalus is not correlated with postoperative CSF leak and can be consequently defined as benign pneumocephalus, since it is completely absorbed within a week. However, intracranial air at the level of the convexity, interhemispheric fissure, sellar, parasellar, and perimesencephalic region is correlated with postoperative CSF leak (OR 4.9). In our cohort, we took into account only severe symptomatic pneumocephalus independently of its location, which was found in 8 patients (0.9%) and was variably associated with other complications (e.g. CSF leak, meningitis, brain herniation). The condition was treated in the majority of cases (75%) with revision surgery; in two patients, it resolved spontaneously.

Brain herniation after endoscopic surgery for sinonasal malignancies is an extremely rare condition (0.64%) that was treated in all cases with revision surgery. This adverse event seems unrelated to the size of the defect or technique of anterior SB reconstruction, but rather to the presence of increased intracranial pressure associated with obesity or obstructive sleep apnea.

Considering early infectious adverse events, meningitis was reported in four postoperative cases, which was isolated (without CSF leak or pneumocephalus) in two cases. The presence of uncomplicated meningitis after endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery is relatively rare (0.9%–1.8%). A single preoperative dose of antibiotic (third generation cephalosporine) is routinely administered in all three centers, unless an infected surgical field is noted. Only presence of infection during intraoperative examination or evidence of postoperative meningitis warrant culture‐guided long‐term antibiotic therapy. A recent meta‐analysis demonstrated that neither long‐term‐antibiotics nor multiple prophylactic antibiotics were associated with a significant reduction of infectious complications. In our series, all cases of postoperative meningitis without CSF leak were successfully treated with antibiotic therapy (Table 4).

Background and aims: Cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea (CSFR) occurs when cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks through a bony defect into the nasal cavity. This condition poses a significant risk of bacterial meningitis, necessitating timely and accurate diagnosis. Beta‐trace protein (BTP) is the most widely used biomarker for detecting CSF contamination in nasal mucus, but diagnostic reliability is hindered by inconsistent cut‐off values, ranging from 0.24 to 6.00 mg/L in the literature. This study re‐evaluates these cut‐offs to improve diagnostic precision.

Methods: We analyzed BTP levels using nephelometry in pure ventricular and lumbar CSF, serum, and nasal mucus samples from 265 patients with clinically suspected CSFR. Data were further assessed through experimental setups, including pure sample measurement, laboratory modeling of CSF contamination, and retrospective analysis of clinical cases. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed to determine optimal cut‐off values.

Results: BTP concentrations were significantly higher in lumbar CSF (25.10 mg/L) than ventricular CSF (6.70 mg/L, p < 0.001), and higher in serum (0.46 mg/L) compared to nasal mucus (0.29 mg/L, p < 0.001). ROC analysis identified 1.40 mg/L as the most feasible cut‐off for nasal mucus BTP, achieving 100% sensitivity and 94% specificity. Incorporating serum BTP levels did not enhance diagnostic accuracy.

### Improving surgical outcomes in middle cranial fossa cerebrospinal fluid leak repair [^113jZECf]. Neurosurgery Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks of the temporal bone occur in the absence of known iatrogenic or traumatic injury and without underlying congenital malformation. It is a problem that is increasingly encountered in our practice. Holistic treatment of the condition requires meticulous perioperative evaluation of the patient to mitigate underlying risk factors such as obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and other causes of raised intracranial pressure. - Similarly, surgery for CSF leaks requires careful consideration of all potential routes of CSF leakage to improve short- and long-term surgical outcomes.

We have demonstrated that defects in the temporal bone in patients with spontaneous CSF leaks are multifocal and vary in size. In our recent publication, radiological assessment of the skull base in patients with spontaneous CSF leakage revealed defects most commonly occurring in the anterior tegmen mastoideum accounting for more than 50% of cases, followed by the anterior tegmen tympani. Notably, almost two-thirds of patients had at least 3 defects identified within the tegmen at varying locations bilaterally, despite presenting with unilateral symptomatology, reflective of the multifocal nature of this disease. The size of these defects varied (1–10 mm) but a majority of patients had defects greater than 2.5 mm on both the affected and unaffected sides. In addition, although the bony defects have been characterized, the role of adjacent dura mater defects remains less certain.

This article describes the surgical technique we use to repair spontaneous CSF leaks of the temporal bone via a middle cranial fossa approach. This technique, which assumes that the sources of the leak into the middle ear originates from the overlying middle cranial fossa surface of the temporal bone and adjacent dura, aims to address the multifocal nature of potential routes of CSF leakage to achieve improved rates of surgical success. We also outline the routine perioperative evaluation of all patients with CSF leaks to diagnose and mitigate medical risk factors. Finally, our surgical outcomes are described.

### Spontaneous intracranial hypotension-neurological symptoms, diagnosis, and outcome [^114fz8uM]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic headache was present in 85% of patients; however, this was lower than previous estimates from studies on SIH symptomatology. This discrepancy may be explained by 35% of our patients being diagnosed later than 3 months after onset. Hence, chronification of SIH often changes the orthostatic headache to an unspecific non‐orthostatic headache as shown by Hani et al.

In this study, we identified 48% with cognitive symptoms and 31% with rhinorrhea. The underlying pathology could involve the recently discovered glymphatic clearance system. A decreased intracranial pressure (ICP) due to CSF leakage could affect the absorption of CSF to the venous sinuses, leading to stagnation of CSF in the perivascular space. Such profound ICP changes could also affect CSF circulation and cerebral vessels, but the relationship is still unclear. Interestingly, the nasal mucosa has been demonstrated to drain CSF, which could potentially explain why some SIH patients reported rhinorrhea, if CSF production was increased to compensate for the decrease in ICP. This could speculatively lead to periods with an overabundance of CSF with increased needs of drainage. However, Melin et al. were unable, in 24 patients with CSF disturbances, to show any significant enrichment of CSF tracer in nasal mucosa. Thus, future imaging studies are needed to investigate the possible involvement of the glymphatic system in SIH, resonating with the conclusion by Metha et al. Another possible explanation of rhinorrhea could be the activation of the trigemino‐autonomic reflex similar to the pathophysiology of cluster headaches. Further studies are needed to establish rhinorrhea as an actual symptom of SIH.

### Primary empty sella syndrome in a series of 142 patients [^113WUaxD]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

Object

The primary empty sella syndrome (ESS) represents a heterogeneous clinical picture characterized by endocrine disturbances and signs of intracranial hypertension. An increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) is proposed to be one of the involved pathogenetic factors.

Methods

The series included 142 patients who were observed during a period of 20 years. All patients underwent an ICP and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics evaluation through the use of a lumbar constant-rate infusion test. Impairment of ICP and CSF dynamics was observed in 109 patients (76.8%). In 35 of the 36 patients affected by severe intracranial hypertension without rhinorrhea, improvement in adverse neurological symptoms was achieved after implanting a CSF shunt. Visual function, already seriously compromised before surgery, remained severely altered in one patient. In the group of 34 patients affected by rhinorrhea, CSF leakage was controlled using different surgical treatments: CSF shunt placement in 16 cases, surgical repair of the sellar floor in three, and both procedures in the remaining 13. Two patients refused any surgical treatment.

Conclusions

The role of increased ICP in the pathogenesis and perpetuation of primary ESS has been confirmed. Adverse neurological signs and a CSF leak are correlated with an actual increase in ICP and are relieved after CSF shunt insertion. Cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea is more common than generally thought. Its resolution can be achieved using a careful diagnostic protocol and sometimes may require different surgical procedures.

### Masses of developmental and genetic origin affecting the paediatric craniofacial skeleton [^113M8dVV]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Imaging plays a major role for the delineation of parenchymal and bone abnormalities, and helps in determining the surgical approach (Fig. 13). High-resolution CT depicts the bony defect and shows herniation of brain parenchyma and meninges. MRI illustrates the contents of the cephalocele and the associated brain abnormalities. High-resolution three-dimensional T2 sequences, such as constructive interference steady state (CISS), fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) and three-dimensional T1 sequences, are useful to depict the degree of parenchymal herniation. In patients with CSF rhinorrhoea and otorrhoea, detection of the site of the CSF leak is challenging and may involve several imaging modalities, including invasive procedures such as CT and MRI cisternography. For the diagnosis of active CSF leak, CT cisternography has a sensitivity of 80–85%. MRI cisternography is a better choice for patients with recurrent or inactive CSF fistulas, with a reported sensitivity as high as 100%. Laboratory studies are helpful by evaluating the content of beta-2 transferrin in nasal secretions. Occasionally, intraorbital cephaloceles can mimic an orbital dermoid or epidermoid cyst. In these situations, cephaloceles present as extraconal masses in the medial orbit without clearly identifiable connection to the intracranial contents. The treatment of cephaloceles involves a multidisciplinary approach and various surgical techniques to treat the cause, symptoms and secondary complications.

### Gadolinium-myelocisternography for cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhoea [^111zTEkF]. Neuroradiology (2000). Low credibility.

Knowledge of the exact site of leakage of cerebrospinal fluid CSF leakage is important for planning surgery. We report our experience with myelocisternography with Gd-DTPA. We decided that intrathecal use of this contrast medium was justified in selected cases when other techniques have failed. After we had given detailed information to four patients with CSF leakage, they underwent five examinations. The images were interpreted by comparing those before and after injection. In all cases the contrast medium arrived at the basal cisterns, giving high contrast against adjacent structures. All patients tolerated the examination without complications or any indication of side effects.

### Surgical outcomes comparison of spontaneous middle cranial fossa cerebrospinal fluid leaks: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112oNU6D]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Although this systematic review provides valuable insights into the surgical approach trends and preferences among surgeons repairing spontaneous MCF CSF leaks, its findings should be interpreted with caution. The overall quality of evidence among the included studies is low, consisting mostly of case series and case‐control studies. Considering the low incidence of recurrence reported, the possibility of reporting bias as well as complication and recurrence underreporting cannot be safely excluded. Only three databases (MEDLINE; via PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library) were searched, as they are considered to include the majority of published international literature. Articles published in languages other than English were excluded, and non‐English journals were not reviewed, whereas congress abstracts and studies whose full texts were unavailable were not included.

### Cholesterol granuloma mimicking CSF otorrhea by β-trace-protein production [^114Kzvtn]. Otology & Neurotology (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Cholesterol granuloma specimens from all patients were found to be positive for BTP, as determined by either chemical analysis or qPCR or both. Despite the low amount of liquid content, a simultaneous ß-2-transferrin testing could be performed in four cases and interestingly could not be detected. These findings support the lack of clinical and radiological evidence of a skull base defect and CSF leakage. However, they raise the question of whether BTP is really a suitable marker for CSF detection in clinical practice, and whether the used cut-offs are appropriate.

In recent decades, BTP nephelometric testing has emerged as a rapid, noninvasive, and more accessible alternative. Even though BTP is one of the most important polypeptide components of CSF with a concentration 35 times higher than in serum and thus a highly sensitive and specific biomarker, it is also found in high concentrations in other body fluids, including urine, seminal fluid, peri- and endolymph, pleura effusion. and ascites. The optimal cut-off values for CSF detection remain uncertain, with a wide range of proposed values from 0.35 mg/l to 6 mg/l and geographically varying test protocols. Furthermore, increased BTP concentrations were observed in serum and nasal secretions in patients with impaired renal function, whereas lower levels were observed in patients with bacterial meningitis. Consequently, these findings must be interpreted with caution. ß-2-transferrin, the asialo form of transferrin, was the first specific marker for CSF detection available. Despite the fact that immunofixation electrophoresis of ß-2-transferrin is both time-consuming and less cost-effective than ß-trace analysis, it has been determined that ß-2-transferrin is found exclusively in the CSF, perilymph, and eye fluid. Therefore, it is a highly specific and reliable marker.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^1121fxhw]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) initial evaluation — clinical assessment should include measurement of vital signs (temperature, pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate) and a physical examination of the head and neck, with attention to hyponasal speech indicating obstruction and purulent drainage on anterior rhinoscopy or in the posterior pharynx. Patients should be evaluated for signs or symptoms of extra-sinus involvement including orbital or facial cellulitis, frontal or orbital protrusion, abnormalities of eye movement, diplopia, change in vision, or concern for meningitis or sepsis. Culture of secretions from the nasal cavity or nasopharynx does not differentiate ABRS from VRS; a middle meatus culture guided by endoscopy has better correlation, but its role in routine management of uncomplicated ABRS has not been established. There is no indication for imaging in ARS unless extra-sinus involvement is suspected. Use of c-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin has been shown to decrease antibiotic use without adverse sequelae, but it is unclear if routine laboratory evaluation is beneficial or cost-effective.

### Nontraumatic cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea… [^115HeZxK]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

A PATIENT with "spontaneous" rhinorrhea presents an interesting problem in diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Ommaya et al1 have recently offered a new classification of the disease, which they designate as "nontraumatic cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea. " They subdivide it into high pressure and low pressure types and further classify it as indicated in Fig 1. Because of the possibility of repeated attacks of meningitis after apparent spontaneous closure of a fistula, 2 they advocate aggressive surgical attack on the disease. Di Chiro et al3 have recently described the use of isotope cisternography to diagnose, and indeed, locate the site of a CSF leak, the prerequisite of surgical management. Two cases of nontraumatic CSF rhinorrhea were recently seen at the National Hospital in which a fistula arose at a site unusual for this disease, apparently as a result of a persistent craniopharyngeal canal. Also, in both cases, the rhinorrhea stopped Kaufman HH.

### Beta-trace protein test: new guidelines for the reliable diagnosis of cerebrospinal fluid fistula [^112L4Gcq]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistulas need to be reliably diagnosed for the optimal management. Recently, in preference to beta2-transferrin, another CSF protein, beta-trace protein (betaTP), is similarly used with a new method for CSF diagnosis. This study evaluates the sensitive interpretation and limits of this new betaTP test for use in routine CSF fistula diagnosis.

Methods

Nephelometric detection of betaTP has been made in nasal secretion, serum, and CSF samples from healthy individuals as well as patients with reduced glomerular filtration rate and with bacterial meningitis. Additionally, 53 patients with suspected CSF rhinorrhea are also analyzed.

Results

The betaTP test can also be used to reliably diagnose CSF rhinorrhea even slightly better than the beta2-transferrin test. It should not be used for patients with renal insufficiency and bacterial meningitis as they substantially increase serum and decrease CSF betaTP values, respectively.

Conclusion

Quantitative measurement of betaTP is a noninvasive, highly sensitive, quick, and inexpensive method that can be used for the detection of CSF rhinorrhea in nasal secretions. However, in cases where there is doubt about the interpretation, the results should be proved with beta2-transferrin test or sodium-fluorescein test.

### Pneumocephalus patterns following endonasal endoscopic skull base surgery as predictors of postoperative CSF leaks [^116Uii74]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Postoperative pneumocephalus is a common occurrence after endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery (ESBS). The risk of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks can be high and the presence of postoperative pneumocephalus associated with serosanguineous nasal drainage may raise suspicion for a CSF leak. The authors hypothesized that specific patterns of pneumocephalus on postoperative imaging could be predictive of CSF leaks. Identification of these patterns could guide the postoperative management of patients undergoing ESBS.

Methods

The authors queried a prospectively acquired database of 526 consecutive ESBS cases at a single center between December 1, 2003, and May 31, 2012, and identified 258 patients with an intraoperative CSF leak documented using intrathecal fluorescein. Postoperative CT and MRI scans obtained within 1–10 days were examined and pneumocephalus was graded based on location and amount. A discrete 0–4 scale was used to classify pneumocephalus patterns based on size and morphology. Pneumocephalus was correlated with the surgical approach, histopathological diagnosis, and presence of a postoperative CSF leak.

Results

The mean follow-up duration was 56.7 months. Of the 258 patients, 102 (39.5%) demonstrated pneumocephalus on postoperative imaging. The most frequent location of pneumocephalus was frontal (73 [71.5%] of 102), intraventricular (34 [33.3%]), and convexity (22 [21.6%]). Patients with craniopharyngioma (27 [87%] of 31) and meningioma (23 [68%] of 34) had the highest incidence of postoperative pneumocephalus compared with patients with pituitary adenomas (29 [20.6%] of 141) (p < 0.0001). The incidence of pneumocephalus was higher with transcribriform and transethmoidal approaches (8 of [73%] 11) than with a transsellar approach (9 of [7%] 131). There were 15 (5.8%) of 258 cases of postoperative CSF leak, of which 10 (66.7%) had pneumocephalus, compared with 92 (38%) of 243 patients without a postoperative CSF leak (OR 3.3, p = 0.027). Pneumocephalus located in the convexity, interhemispheric fissure, sellar region, parasellar region, and perimesencephalic region was significantly correlated with a postoperative CSF leak (OR 4.9, p = 0.006) and was therefore termed "suspicious" pneumocephalus. In contrast, frontal or intraventricular pneumocephalus was not correlated with postoperative CSF leak (not significant) and was defined as "benign" pneumocephalus. The amount of convexity pneumocephalus (p = 0.002), interhemispheric pneumocephalus (p = 0.005), and parasellar pneumocephalus (p = 0.007) (determined using a scale score of 0–4) was also significantly related to postoperative CSF leaks. Using a series of permutation-based multivariate analyses, the authors established that a model containing the learning curve, the transclival/transcavernous approach, and the presence of "suspicious" pneumocephalus provides the best overall prediction for postoperative CSF leaks.

Conclusions

Postoperative pneumocephalus is much more common following extended approaches than following transsellar surgery. Merely the presence of pneumocephalus, particularly in the frontal or intraventricular locations, is not necessarily associated with a postoperative CSF leak. A "suspicious" pattern of air, namely pneumocephalus in the convexity, interhemispheric fissure, sella, parasellar, or perimesencephalic locations, is significantly associated with a postoperative CSF leak. The presence and the score of "suspicious" pneumocephalus on postoperative imaging, in conjunction with the learning curve and the type of endoscopic approach, provide the best predictive model for postoperative CSF leaks.

### Petrous bone cholesteatoma presenting as CSF rhinorrhea: an extremely rare case report [^116mi3kr]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients with petrous bone cholesteatoma most commonly present with hearing loss and facial paralysis. Other clinical presentations can include otorrhea, tinnitus, aural fullness, otalgia, and dizziness. Here, we report a patient with petrous bone cholesteatoma who presented with cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea. This patient was initially misdiagnosed with rhinogenic cerebrospinal fluid leakage, and was finally diagnosed with the supralabyrinthine type of petrous bone cholesteatoma. During the surgical repair through the transmastoid trans-superior semicircular canal approach, the fistula was found in the superior wall of the internal auditory canal. He had satisfactory outcomes after the surgery, with no recurrent cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea.

### Cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea as a unique cause of hyponatremia [^114UFaao]. Pediatric Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Hypovolemic hyponatremia in the pediatric population is a common electrolyte disturbance, most often secondary to salt loss in excess of water loss from the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., diarrhea). We present an unusual case of an 18-month-old boy who had recurrent hyponatremic, hyperkalemic dehydration secondary to salt losses from cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea and low dietary salt intake. An extensive evaluation revealed normal renal and endocrine function. Head imaging revealed a persistent craniopharyngeal canal, suggesting a communication between the nasopharynx and subarachnoid space. The nasal secretion was confirmed to be cerebrospinal fluid by detection of beta transferrin-2. This case highlights cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea as an unusual, but clinically significant, cause of sodium loss.

### Rapid intrathecal fluorescein injection during cerebrospinal fluid leak repair is safe and effective [^1176jpkE]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Intrathecal fluorescein (IF) is effective for localizing nasal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks along the skull base during endoscopic exploration, with largest studies reporting sensitivities ranging from 66%-93%. Due to reports of intraoperative and postoperative neurologic complications such as seizures and paralysis, surgeons often dilute the fluorescein and inject it intrathecally slowly over a variable amount of time. However, no study has assessed whether rapid IF administration causes the aforementioned risks or whether it affects its accuracy in identifying CSF leaks intraoperatively.

Methods

A prospective study was conducted from 2015 to 2024, where all patients undergoing endoscopic exploration and/or repair of CSF rhinorrhea had 0.1mL of 10% fluorescein (10mg) mixed with 3-5mL of patients' CSF injected rapidly via the lumbar drain over a few seconds.

Results

Of the 82 included patients, the mean age was 53.8 ± 15.2years, and 84% were female. Sixty-nine patients underwent successful endoscopic CSF leak repairs, and 13 had negative endoscopic explorations. Rapid IF injection was 80% sensitive (20% false negative rate) and 100% specific for identifying CSF leaks, and it caused no seizures, paralysis, or other neurologic complications.

Conclusion

Compared to prior reports of slow low-dose IF injection for CSF leak localization, rapid IF injection yielded similar efficacy (80% sensitivity) with no IF-related complications. Rapid IF injection was safe and effective but should be corroborated by future studies.

### CSF leaks: correlation of high-resolution CT and multiplanar reformations with intraoperative endoscopic findings [^116bBeMz]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Skull base defects can result in CSF leaks, with meningitis as a potential complication. Surgeons are now routinely repairing these leaks via a nasal endoscopic approach. Accurate preoperative imaging is essential for surgical planning. A variety of imaging regimens have been employed, including axial and direct coronal CT, CT cisternography with iodinated contrast, radionuclide cisternography, and MR imaging. Now that multidetector helical CT is available, the purpose of this study was to determine how well coronal and sagittal multiplanar reformatted (MPR) images generated from a high-resolution axial dataset correlate with intraoperative findings in a group of patients with clinically proved CSF leaks.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed imaging findings and surgical records of 19 patients who presented to our tertiary care institution during a 2.5-year period with clinically proved CSF leak. Patients underwent preoperative imaging with high-resolution helical CT (section collimation, 10 patients with 0.625-mm and 9 patients with 1.25-mm images), with MPR images processed by a neuroradiologist at a workstation. Two neuroradiologists, blinded to the intraoperative findings, determined the location and size of the skull base defects. All patients underwent endoscopic evaluation by an experienced sinonasal otolaryngologist, who confirmed the site of the CSF leak by direct inspection and measured the corresponding osseous defect. CT was considered accurate if it correctly localized the CSF leak and was within 2 mm of the endoscopic measurement.

Results

At endoscopy, 22 leaks of CSF were identified in 18 of 19 patients. CT correctly predicted the site of the leak in 20 (91%) of 22 cases and was accurate (within 2 mm of the endoscopic measurement) in 15 (75%) of 20 cases preoperatively localized. The CT measurement of the skull base defect differed from the endoscopic size in 5 (25%) of 20 cases, ranging from 7.4 mm below to 13 mm above the intraoperative measurement. When analysis was limited to the subgroup of 10 patients who had 0.625-mm axial images, the accuracy was improved, and of the 11 CSF leaks described at CT, all were verified at endoscopy. In addition, the submillimeter CT accurately measured the size of the osseous defect in 9 (82%) of 11 cases. In the remaining 2 (18%) of 11 cases, CT minimally overestimated the size of the osseous defect by only 3 mm.

Conclusion

Axial images, and coronal, sagittal, and oblique MPR images generated from high-resolution axial CT performed well preoperatively, localizing the skull base defect responsible for the CSF leak. However, active manipulation of the axial dataset at a workstation is crucial in identifying and correctly describing these lesions. When submillimeter collimation is available, measurement of the osseous defects are accurate most of the time.

### Aggressive intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula presenting with cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea: case report [^117FjJMj]. Neurosurgery (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

This is the first report of an aggressive dural arteriovenous fistula presenting with rhinorrhea. It demonstrates the importance of recognizing increased intracranial pressure, and its underlying cause, as the predisposing factor to a spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak because this carries implications for management.

Clinical Presentation

Ten years after minor trauma and directly after an intercontinental flight, a 43-year-old woman presented with rhinorrhea. Right-sided pulsatile tinnitus had been present for the past 9 years. Imaging demonstrated an intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula of the right transverse sinus with cortical venous reflux. Magnetic resonance imaging findings indicated long-standing increased intracranial pressure.

Intervention

The fistula was treated by endovascular means, using both transvenous and transarterial approaches, which led to immediate relief of the tinnitus and resolution of the rhinorrhea within 4 days.

Conclusion

A dural arteriovenous fistula should be included in the differential diagnosis of underlying causes of increased intracranial pressure when examining a patient with a cerebrospinal fluid leak. Treatment of the fistula should precede attempts to treat the rhinorrhea, especially if the fistula has cortical venous reflux.

### A management algorithm for cerebrospinal fluid leak associated with anterior skull base fractures: detailed clinical and radiological follow-up [^116SkdFM]. Neurosurgical Review (2012). Low credibility.

Detailed outcome data for the management of anterior skull base fractures associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage is lacking. We present detailed follow-up data of a single-center study using a predetermined algorithm for the management of CSF leakage secondary to traumatic fractures. A number of 138 consecutive patients were included in the analysis; all patients underwent high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scanning at time of admission with β₂-transferrin testing used to confirm CSF leakage. Patients with acute surgical indications were operated as emergent; leaks were repaired at the time of initial surgery in patients with intracranial pressure < 15 cm H₂O. The remainder of the study population was managed conservatively including use of prophylactic antibiotics; lumbar drainage (LD) catheters were placed in those patients with leakage persisting beyond 48 h. Leaks lasting longer than 5 days underwent microsurgical repair using an intradural bicoronal approach. One-year follow-up assessment included evaluation of neurological status, Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), and repeat head CT. Twenty eight patients (26.9%) underwent emergent surgery, 15 of whom had simultaneous CSF leak repair, whereas 76 patients (73.1%) underwent delayed CSF leak repair between days 5 and 14. Postoperative meningitis rate was low (1.9%). Postoperative CSF leak (1.9%) was managed by intradural or transnasal endoscopic operation. Comparable rates of anosmia and frontal lobe hypodensities were seen in the surgical and conservatively managed subgroups. The presented algorithm, utilizing prophylactic antibiotics, trial of LD, acute and/or delayed intradural microsurgery, yields favorable outcomes. Large randomized controlled trials are needed to better define the role of prophylactic antibiotics and to better characterize the optimal timing and approach of surgical repair.

### Surgical outcomes comparison of spontaneous middle cranial fossa cerebrospinal fluid leaks: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1145fvt2]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks, characterized by the unexpected escape of CSF through a defect in the dura mater, represent a significant clinical challenge. These leaks can lead to a range of symptoms, from mild headaches to severe neurological complications, significantly impacting patients' quality of life. Understanding the varied approaches to manage and treat spontaneous CSF leaks is crucial, as the efficacy, risks, and recovery profiles differ markedly between methods.

Traditionally, conservative management, including bed rest, hydration, and caffeine intake, has been the first‐line approach. Although noninvasive, this approach is poorly evidence‐based and often yields variable results and may not provide long‐term relief. In cases where conservative treatment fails, more aggressive interventions are warranted. Medical management, such as administration of acetazolamide, has been used in selective patients as a single line of treatment, although in the majority of patients as an adjunct to surgical treatment.

Surgical repair, although often avoided or delayed, offers a definitive solution by directly addressing the site of the leak. Advances in minimally invasive surgical techniques have improved outcomes, reducing recovery time and minimizing risks. Moreover, imaging technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and potentially myelography play a pivotal role in accurately localizing the leak location, thereby enhancing the precision and success of surgical interventions.

The choice of treatment approach is influenced by several factors, including the severity and location of the leak, patient health status, and previous treatment responses. Comparative studies and clinical trials continue to refine these strategies, aiming to optimize patient outcomes and minimize complications. Although previous studies in the literature have investigated the surgical outcomes of CSF leaks repair, and the repair outcomes of different materials for lateral spontaneous CSF leaks, no study has reviewed the outcomes of different surgical approaches for spontaneous CSF leaks of the lateral skull base.

The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review of existing literature with meta‐analysis to compare the success rates and complications of alternative surgical techniques for spontaneous middle cranial fossa (MCF) CSF leak repair.

### Cerebrospinal fluid leaks complicating orbital or oculoplastic surgery… [^111aQVrb]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

In the second case, a β2-transferrin test result confirmed the presence of CSF in the nasal drip, and coronal computed tomography identified a small fracture near the fovea ethmoidalis, but the leak resolved within 2 days of bed rest. In the third case, the patient reported several days of nasal dripping, but the problem had already resolved at the first follow-up appointment. The day after surgery, his visual acuity was 20/20 OU, and he had no afferent pupillary defect. Two days later after returning to his home in a remote community, he contacted us and reported clear fluid draining from his right nostril, particularly when leaning forward. With a suspected diagnosis of CSF leak, he was prescribed bed rest for a week and was asked to immediately report the development of fever or neurologic complaints. She was admitted to the hospital with a suspected CSF leak, and a consultation with neurosurgery was arranged.

A CT scan showed a bony defect near the right fovea ethmoidalis, and a sample of the fluid demonstrated the presence of β2-transferrin, confirming CSF rhinorrhea. She was treated with bed rest, and the leak spontaneously resolved 2 days later. Her visual acuity returned to 20/20 OU. The first step when suspecting a leak is to confirm that the fluid is CSF. A simple test in an office or bedside setting is to place a pledget soaked in fluorescein, 5%, intranasally. If it turns from yellow to green, this is suggestive of a CSF leak. In patients with insufficient fluid, asking the patient to perform a Valsalva maneuver and to lean forward may induce the leak.
3. Glucose levels in CSF are two-thirds those of serum levels, and glucose strips have been used to diagnose CSF leaks because glucose concentrations in nasal secretions are low. However, upper respiratory tract infections or blood contamination of the nasal sample may give false-positive results.

Because of poor specificity and only 80% sensitivity, this test is not recommended.

### Diagnosis and treatment of cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea following accidental traumatic anterior skull base fractures [^1141f77d]. Neurosurgical Focus (2012). Low credibility.

Cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea is a serious and potentially fatal condition because of an increased risk of meningitis and brain abscess. Approximately 80% of all cases occur in patients with head injuries and craniofacial fractures. Despite technical advances in the diagnosis and management of CSF rhinorrhea caused by craniofacial injury through the introduction of MRI and endoscopic extracranial surgical approaches, difficulties remain. The authors review here the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of CSF rhinorrhea relevant exclusively to traumatic anterior skull base injuries and attempt to identify areas in which further work is needed.

### Utility of magnetic resonance imaging in differentiating cerebrospinal fluid leak from middle ear effusion [^111rFimW]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To demonstrate the clinical utility, sensitivity, and specificity of standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences in differentiating temporal bone cerebrospinal fluid leaks from all other middle ear effusions.

Study Design

Retrospective imaging review.

Setting

Academic medical center.

Subjects

Patients with cerebrospinal fluid leaks or other middle ear effusions who also underwent MRI.

Methods

Patients were assigned to cerebrospinal fluid leak and other effusion cohorts based on clinical course, findings at surgery/myringotomy, and beta-2 transferrin fluid analysis. Reviewers blinded to the clinical outcome examined T1-weighted, T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and 3-dimensional (3D) acquired T2-weighted MRI sequences. For each sequence, fluid imaged in the temporal bone was graded as either similar or dissimilar in signal intensity to cerebrospinal fluid in the adjacent subarachnoid space. Signal similarity was interpreted as being diagnostic of a leak. Test characteristics in predicting the presence of a leak were calculated for each series.

Results

Eighty patients met criteria (41 leaks, 39 other effusions). The 3D T2 series was 76% sensitive and 100% specific in diagnosing a leak, and FLAIR was 44% sensitive and 100% specific. The T1-weighted (73% sensitive, 69% specific), T2-weighted (98% sensitive, 5.1% specific), and diffusion-weighted (63% sensitive, 66% specific) series were less useful.

Conclusions

MRI, with attention to 3D T2 and FLAIR series, is a noninvasive and highly specific test for diagnosing cerebrospinal fluid leak in the setting of an indeterminate middle ear effusion.

### Cholesterol granuloma mimicking CSF otorrhea by β-trace-protein production [^112jEZMK]. Otology & Neurotology (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The data presented herein provide clear evidence that cholesterol granuloma produce significant quantities of BTP, which is clinically utilized as a marker for CSF. Consequently, cholesterol granuloma may result in erroneous diagnoses of CSF leakage. In addition, there is evidence that ß-2-transferrin is not produced by cholesterol granuloma, rendering it a more suitable marker for CSF otorrhea in comparison to BTP. Further investigations are needed to clarify whether chronic inflammatory processes of the middle ear can produce BTP and thus can mimic CSF leakage as well.

### Spontaneous skull base cerebrospinal fluid leak during pregnancy: a case report and review of the literature [^1133ahxw]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension can lead to dural defects and spontaneous leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the skull base. Skull base CSF leaks are rarely reported in pregnancy but pose unique challenges for obstetricians and anesthesiologists.

Case Presentation

A 31-year-old G4P1021 at 14 weeks developed debilitating headaches and CSF rhinorrhea. Brain imaging revealed a bony defect of the sphenoid sinus with a meningoencephalocele and a partially empty sella, consistent with CSF leakage from a skull base defect. The patient was neurologically stable without signs of meningitis; thus, management was focused on symptomatic alleviation. A planned cesarean section was performed at 38 weeks under spinal anesthesia. The patient had spontaneous marked improvement of her symptoms postpartum.

Conclusion

Pregnancy may exacerbate skull base CSF leaks, requiring careful management with a multidisciplinary team. Neuraxial anesthesia can safely be performed in pregnant individuals with spontaneous skull base CSF leakage, but further studies are needed to determine the safest mode of delivery in these patients.

METHODS

Preoperative Evaluation

All patients who present with possible CSF leaks of the temporal bone undergo aspiration of middle ear fluid for beta trace protein (BTP) for biochemical confirmation of the diagnosis. They then undergo high-resolution computed tomography (CT) temporal bone scan with additional cuts of the face (image-guided surgery protocol). All patients also undergo an MRI brain/temporal bone scan to exclude coexisting meningoencephaloceles, anatomical anomalies, and venous sinus obstruction. Other than for surgical planning, imaging is also able to highlight any radiological evidence of raised intracranial pressure, which may require further evaluation and treatment preoperatively. Where indicated, MR venogram will be performed to further visualize the patency of the cerebral veins and venous sinuses. Where there is clinical suspicion of raised intracranial pressure, a neurology referral would be made for consideration of medical treatment and potential lumbar puncture.

In addition, because of the high incidence of OSA in patients with CSF leaks, all patients also undergo a polysomnography.

Surgical Technique

The procedure is performed under general anesthesia and routine translaryngeal intubation. Long-acting muscle relaxants and the use of muscle relaxant reversal agents are avoided to prevent interference with subsequent facial nerve monitoring. Instead, only a single dose of short-acting muscle relaxant is used at the start of anesthesia and allowed to wear off naturally. The patient is positioned supine with the head turned 60 to 90° away from the side of surgery. A unilateral shoulder roll is placed to facilitate this position and to avoid over-rotation of the patient's neck and potential compression of the contralateral internal jugular vein. Once ideal positioning is achieved, the patient's head is secured with Mayfields pins. CT navigation for image-guided surgery (IGS) is set up. Two-channel facial nerve neuromonitoring is set up. These are illustrated in Figure 1. An indwelling urinary catheter and invasive radial arterial line is inserted to facilitate diuresis and blood pressure monitoring during the procedure. Acetazolamide 0.5 g/kg, levetiracetam 500 mg, and cephazolin 1 g are given intravenously.

### Localization of cerebrospinal fluid leaks by gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance cisternography: a 5-year single-center experience [^111NVct9]. Neurosurgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Intrathecal gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) cisternography is a newly introduced imaging method. Two main objectives of this study were to investigate the sensitivity of Gd-enhanced MR cisternography for presurgical localization of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks in patients with CSF rhinorrhea and to study the potential long-term adverse effects of intrathecal Gd application.

Methods

Fifty-one patients (19 women; mean age, 36.2 yr) with CSF rhinorrhea were included in the study. A total of 0.5 mL of Gd was injected into the lumbar subarachnoid space. T1-weighted MR cisternographic images were obtained to detect CSF leakage. The patient's neurological states and vital signs were recorded for the first 24 hours after the procedure. Neurological evaluations were repeated 1, 3, and 12 months after the procedure. The patients were followed for at least 3 years with annual neurological examinations.

Results

Gd-enhanced MR cisternography demonstrated CSF leaks in 43 of the 51 patients. The sensitivity of Gd-enhanced MR cisternography for localization of CSF leaks was 84%. Forty-four patients underwent surgery to repair dural tears. Surgical findings confirmed the results of Gd-enhanced cisternography in 43 of the 44 patients who underwent surgery (98%). Eight patients with negative Gd-enhanced MR cisternography had no active rhinorrhea at the time of procedure, and seven of them did not need surgery. None of the patients developed an acute adverse reaction that could be attributed to the procedure. None of the patients developed any neurological symptoms or signs caused by intrathecal Gd injection during a mean follow-up period of 4.12 years.

Conclusion

Gd-enhanced MR cisternography is a sensitive and safe imaging method for detection of CSF leaks in patients with rhinorrhea.

### An uncommon etiological factor for aspiration pneumonitis caused by spontaneous sphenoid sinus meningoencephalocele with cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea: a case report [^1166zp6K]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Meningoencephalocele occurs mainly in infants with a very low incidence and is extremely rare in adults. Zada et al. first reported a case about chronic aspiration-induced pneumonitis caused by spontaneous ethmoid sinus meningocele with CSF rhinorrhea, and indicated that increased diagnostic complexity associated with pulmonary complications led to unnecessary intervention and treatment delays. CSF rhinorrhea can be considered as a cause of chronic pneumonitis despite the lack of direct evidence. A controlled clinical trial has shown that sinonasal secretions can be transferred to the lungs whether in patients with cystic fibrosis or healthy subjects. In this case, meningoencephalocele is located in the lateral wall of sphenoidal sinus and leads to persistent CSF rhinorrhea. Endoscopic surgery can be an effective and a safe treatment option for resection of meningoencephalocele and skull base reconstruction. A rapid improvement of symptoms, abnormal imaging findings and inflammation markers caused by pneumonitis after endoscopic surgery also proves that spontaneous sphenoid sinus meningoencephalocele with CSF rhinorrhea is a key factor to induce aspiration pneumonitis. However, the lesion could still progress further in the early postoperative period due to the persistence of the local inflammatory response caused by residence of components of CSF and the bacteria of nasal cavity and oropharynx along with CSF in the lungs. Continuous dry cough gives rise to raised intracranial pressure, which further increases flow of CSF and persistent aspiration. In addition, persistent cough caused by postnasal drip of CSF in the supine position may also cause reflux of gastric contents and increase the chance of aspiration. However, the direct evidence of aspiration pneumonitis caused by CSF rhinorrhea needs further clinical investigation.

Although uncommon, spontaneous sphenoid sinus meningoencephalocele with CSF rhinorrhea is an etiological factor for macroaspiration. Timely endoscopic lesion resection and repair of skull base defect can effectively avoid large-volume aspiration and make aspiration pneumonitis less likely to occur.

### Outcome after surgical treatment of cerebrospinal fluid leaks in spontaneous intracranial hypotension-a matter of time [^116TnwZi]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is an important cause of incapacitating headache. It affects primarily young and middle-aged patients, with an estimated incidence of 5/100,000. The hallmark symptom is orthostatic headache, but the clinical spectrum is diverse and encompasses other orthostatic symptoms such as visual or vestibulocochlear manifestations. SIH is mainly caused by a spinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak primarily located in the cervical and thoracic region. While epidural blood patching remains a commonly performed intervention for spinal CSF leaks, its response rate varies widely in the literature. In refractory cases, surgical closure of the spinal CSF leak is a more definitive treatment. Despite definitive surgical closure of the leak, some patients suffer from residual symptoms. It remains unclear, which patient benefits most from surgical treatment and which factors negatively affect outcome.

As acknowledged by the International Headache Society in the 3rd edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD), and supported by our previous work, the clinical signs and symptoms associated with SIH can change over time. The orthostatic nature of the headache can become less obvious with increasing duration of the disease, a feature that is often accompanied by a change in CSF dynamics. This evolution might represent an adaptive change, but its influence on outcome has never been investigated in a clinical setting.

The aim of the present study was to assess predictors for favorable outcome after surgical treatment of SIH. Based on our previous work, we hypothesized that a longer duration of preoperative symptoms might negatively affect outcome.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on postdural puncture headache: a consensus report from a multisociety international working group [^116yHcgN]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) adverse consequences and follow-up — adverse consequences may be associated with delayed EBP, and although data are limited, long-term adverse symptomatic outcomes may occur with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks lasting ≥ 12 weeks in some patients. Recommendation: Until symptom resolution, regular patient follow-up should assess for adverse outcomes, encourage early repeat EBP in cases of suspected persistent or severe CSF leak (Grade C; Low Level of Certainty).

### Unusual clinical presentations of giant prolactinomas [^114PmW2N]. Pituitary (2011). Low credibility.

Giant prolactinomas are rare pituitary tumors which have scarcely been reported in the literature. We describe three men with unusual presenting features of prolactin-secreting giant pituitary adenomas: prolonged and increasingly disturbing intolerance to light and noise; strange behavior and mood disturbances; and rhinorrhea followed by a finding of cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Treatment with dopamine agonist alleviated all symptoms, with concomitant suppression of plasma prolactin levels and a significant reduction in tumor mass. These cases emphasize the importance of considering unusual symptoms in the differential diagnosis of giant prolactinomas and the effectiveness of medical treatment.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on postdural puncture headache: a consensus report from a multisociety international working group [^115gYqw5]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) severity and imaging correlation — PDPH can be classified as mild, moderate and severe based on the amount of rest and physical activity per day and associated auditory and vestibular symptoms. Atypical presentation of PDPH has been increasingly recognized. In selected contexts, extensive CSF leak on MRI and MRI scores correlate with the severity of PDPH symptoms.
