## Question

Normal newborn hemoglobin value

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about normal newborn hemoglobin values, including how they vary by gestational age, postnatal age, and sampling context, and how to interpret them in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core principle that "normal" hemoglobin in neonates is gestational and postnatal age–specific. Then, I should verify typical cord blood hemoglobin ranges for term infants and how they differ from preterm infants. Next, I will examine the immediate postnatal hemodynamic shifts and the expected physiologic decline over the first month. After that, I need to check how anemia is defined in neonates using percentile-based cutoffs rather than fixed thresholds. Finally, I will consider maternal and sampling factors that influence interpretation and outline practical clinical implications, including when to use transfusion thresholds versus diagnostic definitions of anemia [^111mP78c] [^112vSP7r].

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: normal hemoglobin in newborns is not a single number but a range that depends on gestational age at birth and postnatal age, so I need to ensure any quoted values are anchored to those axes before interpreting an individual result [^111mP78c] [^111FVWTW].

> I will now examine cord blood hemoglobin at birth for term infants; wait, let me verify the most consistent estimates. Multiple contemporary cohorts report mean cord hemoglobin around 14.5–15.5 g/dL with a 2.5th–97.5th percentile range roughly 12–20 g/dL, and a Tunisian cohort reported a mean of 14.75 ± 2.26 g/dL, which aligns with this estimate, so a working range of about 12–20 g/dL at term is reasonable for cord blood [^115q3SGi] [^114zpLsn].

> Hold on, I should verify preterm patterns before drawing conclusions. Preterm infants have lower cord hemoglobin at birth, and the relationship is approximately linear such that each additional week of gestation increases cord hemoglobin by about 0.21 g/dL; for example, at 30 weeks' gestation the expected cord hemoglobin is around 12–13 g/dL, whereas at 24 weeks it may be closer to 10–11 g/dL, so I need to adjust expectations downward for earlier gestational ages [^111FVWTW].

> Next, I should review immediate postnatal changes; let me think about the redistribution and fluid shifts. In the first 4 hours after birth, term and late preterm infants typically show a hemoconcentration of about 3–4% due to redistribution, whereas infants under 29 weeks may show a decrease of about 6%, so early postnatal hemoglobin can transiently appear higher or lower depending on timing and maturity; after that, a physiologic decline begins and continues over the first month, with hemoglobin falling by roughly 0.5–1.0 g/dL per week in healthy infants, which I should factor into serial interpretations [^111FVWTW].

> I need to ensure I define anemia correctly; let me reconsider whether fixed cutoffs are appropriate. The evidence-based approach is to define neonatal anemia relative to age-specific percentiles, typically using the 5th percentile as the lower limit of normal, with moderately severe anemia between the 1st and 5th percentiles and severe anemia below the 1st percentile; this percentile-based framework avoids the pitfalls of fixed thresholds that ignore developmental physiology [^111mP78c].

> But wait, what about the immediate postnatal window at 24 hours; I should double-check whether a specific reference interval exists. A prospective study of healthy term newborns at 24 hours reported a hemoglobin reference interval of approximately 14.7–21.8 g/dL, which is higher than cord values due to early hemoconcentration; this helps me avoid misclassifying a 24-hour hemoglobin of 16 g/dL as "low" when it is actually within normal for that age [^notfound].

> I will now examine maternal and sampling factors that can shift measured hemoglobin; hold on, I should verify which are most impactful. Maternal anemia is associated with lower neonatal cord hemoglobin by about 1–1.5 g/dL on average, and delayed cord clamping increases neonatal hemoglobin and hematocrit via placental transfusion, so I need to ask about maternal status and cord management before interpreting a borderline value; additionally, capillary samples can read about 1–2 g/dL higher than venous in early life, so site of sampling matters for accuracy [^111y1qeC] [^111vvn7Y].

> Let me translate this into practical clinical ranges while keeping the caveats in mind. For a term infant at birth, cord hemoglobin around 12–20 g/dL is expected, and at 24 hours, 14.7–21.8 g/dL is typical; by day 3–5, values commonly drift down toward 14–18 g/dL, and by 2–4 weeks, many healthy infants are in the 10–14 g/dL range as part of physiologic decline; for preterm infants, I should subtract roughly 0.2 g/dL for each week below 40, and remember that preterm infants reach a lower physiologic nadir around 6–8 weeks, often 7–10 g/dL, which can be appropriate without intervention if asymptomatic [^115q3SGi] [^111FVWTW] [^113DJgFs].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about transfusion needs; I should confirm that transfusion thresholds are not the same as anemia definitions. For very preterm infants under 30 weeks, contemporary guidelines recommend restrictive transfusion thresholds that vary by postnatal week and respiratory support, for example about 11 g/dL in week 1 with support and 10 g/dL without, stepping down to 9 g/dL with support and 7 g/dL without by week 3 and beyond; these operational thresholds are lower than the 5th percentile definition of anemia and should be applied alongside clinical status, not hemoglobin alone [^112vSP7r] [^114CRGsf].

> I should double-check that I'm not conflating population cutoffs with individual diagnosis; let me verify the WHO caveat. WHO anemia thresholds for older infants and children are being re-evaluated because they are statistical and often higher than the 5th percentile in healthy populations, so they are not appropriate for defining neonatal anemia; using gestational and postnatal age–specific percentiles remains the most defensible clinical approach in the newborn period [^111jKc1a] [^117VSpoi] [^111mP78c].

> In summary, I need to ensure that any "normal newborn hemoglobin" statement is framed as gestational and postnatal age–specific: for term infants, cord hemoglobin is typically about 12–20 g/dL, 24-hour values are higher due to hemoconcentration, and a physiologic decline of roughly 0.5–1.0 g/dL per week follows; anemia should be defined by plotting values against age-specific percentiles, with the 5th percentile as the lower limit of normal, while transfusion decisions in very preterm infants follow separate, restrictive thresholds tailored to week of life and respiratory support [^115q3SGi] [^111FVWTW] [^111mP78c] [^112vSP7r].

Normal newborn hemoglobin at birth is **14–20 g/dL** (140–200 g/L) in term infants, with preterm infants typically 1–3 g/dL lower. Hemoglobin peaks at **18–20 g/dL** within 24 hours due to placental transfusion, then declines to a nadir of 9–11 g/dL by 6–8 weeks (physiologic anemia of infancy). Preterm infants reach a lower nadir (**7–9 g/dL**) at 4–6 weeks. Anemia is defined as hemoglobin below the 5th percentile for gestational and postnatal age, and values should be interpreted using gestational age–specific reference ranges [^111mP78c] [^111FVWTW] [^115q3SGi].

---

## Normal hemoglobin values at birth

At birth, **term infants** have a hemoglobin range of 14–20 g/dL (140–200 g/L), with a mean of ~16.5 g/dL. Preterm infants generally have lower levels, typically 1–3 g/dL below those of term infants, owing to immature hematopoiesis and lower blood volume.

---

## Physiological changes in hemoglobin levels after birth

Hemoglobin levels change rapidly after birth, reflecting **physiological adaptation**:

- **Initial rise**: Hemoglobin peaks at 18–20 g/dL within 24 hours due to placental transfusion and fluid shifts.
- **Physiologic decline**: Hemoglobin then declines to a nadir of 9–11 g/dL by 6–8 weeks in term infants (physiologic anemia of infancy).
- **Preterm infants**: Reach a lower nadir (7–9 g/dL) earlier, at 4–6 weeks, due to shorter RBC lifespan and blood loss from sampling.

---

## Factors influencing hemoglobin levels in newborns

Several factors influence **neonatal hemoglobin**:

- **Gestational age**: Lower levels in preterm infants.
- **Birth weight**: Lower levels in small-for-gestational-age infants.
- **Maternal factors**: Anemia, smoking, and hypertension can lower neonatal hemoglobin [^111y1qeC].
- **Cord clamping**: Delayed clamping increases hemoglobin by ~2 g/dL.
- **Genetic factors**: Hemoglobinopathies and G6PD deficiency affect levels [^117SDBHi] [^116sCgnK].

---

## Clinical significance of hemoglobin levels in newborns

Hemoglobin levels guide diagnosis and management: **anemia** is defined as hemoglobin below the 5th percentile for gestational and postnatal age, with severity graded by percentile thresholds [^111mP78c]. Polycythemia is suggested by hemoglobin > 20 g/dL and may require intervention. Hemoglobin informs transfusion decisions, particularly in preterm infants [^112vSP7r].

---

## Laboratory methods for measuring hemoglobin in newborns

Hemoglobin is measured by **automated hematology analyzers**, which are accurate and widely used, and by **point-of-care devices**, which offer rapid, noninvasive screening but may be less accurate than laboratory analyzers [^116g2nht].

---

## Clinical implications of abnormal hemoglobin levels

Abnormal hemoglobin levels have **important clinical consequences**:

- **Anemia**: Associated with poor growth, neurodevelopmental impairment, and increased transfusion risk [^113DJgFs].
- **Polycythemia**: Linked to hyperviscosity, hypoglycemia, and respiratory distress.
- **Hemolytic disease**: Elevated bilirubin and anemia from isoimmunization or G6PD deficiency [^115sMhns].

---

## Management strategies for abnormal hemoglobin levels

Management depends on the **cause and severity**:

- **Anemia**: Iron supplementation, erythropoietin, and transfusion when indicated [^notfound].
- **Polycythemia**: Partial exchange transfusion if symptomatic.
- **Hemolytic disease**: Phototherapy, IVIG, and exchange transfusion as needed [^notfound].

---

Normal newborn hemoglobin at birth is **14–20 g/dL** in term infants, with preterm infants lower by 1–3 g/dL. Levels peak at 18–20 g/dL within 24 hours, then decline to a nadir of 9–11 g/dL by 6–8 weeks in term infants; preterm infants reach a lower nadir earlier. Anemia is defined by age-specific percentiles, and values should be interpreted using gestational age–specific reference ranges.

## References

### Diagnosing anemia in neonates: an evidence-based approach [^111mP78c]. NeoReviews (2023). Medium credibility.

It is important for clinicians who render neonatal care to precisely and reproducibly diagnose anemia; however, confusion arises from various definitions. For the simplicity and consistency of detection, we advocate defining neonatal anemia as a hemoglobin level or hematocrit below the 5th percentile of the reference population, which is highly dependent on gestational and postnatal ages. Thus, a newborn infant delivered at 24 weeks' gestation will have anemia with a blood hemoglobin concentration much lower than a hemoglobin concentration defining anemia at term. Moreover, a hemoglobin concentration defining anemia at term birth is higher than that defining anemia in the same infant 60 days after birth. Diagnosing neonatal anemia can be evidence-based and consistent by using reference intervals derived from large neonatal databases. To do this, we advocate defining anemia as a hemoglobin level that plots below the 5th percentile lower reference interval, defining moderately severe anemia as a hemoglobin value between the 1st and 5th percentile, and defining severe anemia as a hemoglobin level that plots below the 1st percentile. The information provided in this review can easily be adopted by clinical laboratories and individual neonatal care units, thereby fostering application of these definitions for all infants whose hemoglobin levels are measured. Additional normative values included in this review describing various other erythrocyte metrics can likewise be easily adopted. Doing so will codify and standardize the diagnosis of neonatal anemia and will facilitate identifying the cause of the anemia, thus pointing the way to proper additional diagnostic testing and treatment.

### Haemoglobin and red blood cell reference intervals during infancy [^113FyC1C]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2022). Medium credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Scarcity of modern reference interval studies of haemoglobin and red blood cell biomarkers during infancy can have implications on what is considered as normative.
Historical reference intervals risk being outdated due to technical advancements and need to be adjusted to analytical methodology.
Well-defined and narrow reference intervals can strengthen the diagnostic power.

What this study adds?

Reference interval quality improves if detailed population characteristics are known, including information on variables such as gestational age and timing of cord clamping.
Reference interval widths are mainly narrower than those previously reported for these biomarkers.
The WHO lower threshold of haemoglobin 110 g/L for ages 6–12 months may need reinvestigation.

### The definition of anemia: what is the lower limit of normal of the blood hemoglobin concentration? [^111ULGRj]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of anemia is an important aspect of the practice of hematology. The first step is to decide whether the patient is, in fact, anemic. Unless earlier blood counts are available, and they often are not, the physician must make his or her decision on the basis of the population distribution of hemoglobin values. How likely is it that the patient's hemoglobin value lies below the normal distribution; that is, "the lower limit"?

### Issues in neonatal cellular analysis [^116RxhD8]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Hematologic values in neonates differ significantly from those in older children and adults. Quantitative and qualitative differences are present as a reflection of the developmental changes during fetal hematopoiesis and, so, correlate with gestational age. At birth, the hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, and WBC counts of term newborns are significantly higher than those of older children and adults, and in preterm neonates the differences are even more pronounced. This review explores these differences and the major factors that account for them from the hematology laboratory standpoint. After a discussion of the developmental hematopoiesis and normal hematologic values in term and preterm neonates, important preanalytic factors, such as limited blood availability, effect of sampling site, and violent crying, and analytic interferences are examined. Finally, the review addresses resulting challenges in interpretation of hematologic test results in term and preterm neonates, especially issues surrounding neonatal reference intervals and critical value reporting, and suggests possible solutions.

### International values for haemoglobin distributions in healthy pregnant women [^113SovAM]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, these are the first normative ranges of Hb values in pregnancy compatible with good, functional, maternal and perinatal outcomes, as well as neonatal and early childhood morbidity, growth and development up to 2 years of age. The 3 rd - 97 th centile range for maternal Hb is large across gestational ages (around 94 to 141 g/L) clearly demonstrating that healthy pregnant women have adaptive mechanisms to achieve adequate health outcomes within a wide range of Hb values. The resource should, therefore, act as a simple narrative to communicate to mothers the meaning of their routine blood test results.

This work also provides a system, at the individual level, for defining normal Hb distributions based on gestational age-specific cut-offs (< 3 rd centile = low Hb concentration; 3rd - 4.99 th centile = high risk of low Hb concentration; 5 th - 9.99 th centile = moderate risk of low Hb concentration; ≥ 10 th centile = normal Hb concentration), an approach that is well accepted in biology and medicine. In addition, previous studies have suggested that high haemoglobin concentrations may be associated with increased pregnancy risks, including antepartum stillbirth and pre-eclampsia. However, these findings are inconsistent, and in part this may be due to using a fixed cut-offs for defining haemoconcentration despite different gestational ages at the time of blood sampling. We believe that studies in this field can be facilitated by our work by allowing uniformity in gestational-age specific definitions of both low and high haemoglobin concentrations.

### Reference ranges for hematocrit and blood hemoglobin concentration during the neonatal period: data from a multihospital health care system [^111FVWTW]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

"Reference ranges" are developed when it is impossible or inappropriate to establish "normal ranges" by drawing blood on healthy normal volunteers. Reference ranges for the hematocrit and the blood hemoglobin concentration of newborn infants have previously been reported from relatively small sample sizes by using measurement methods that now are considered outmoded.

Methods

We sought to develop reference ranges for hematocrit and hemoglobin during the neonatal period (28 days) by using very large sample sizes and modern hematology analyzers, accounting for gestational and postnatal age and gender. Data were assembled from a multihospital health care system after exclusion of patients with a high likelihood of an abnormal value and those who were receiving blood transfusions.

Results

During the interval from 22 to 40 weeks' gestation, the hematocrit and blood hemoglobin concentration increased approximately linearly. For every week advance in gestational age, the hematocrit increased by 0.64% and the hemoglobin concentration increased by 0.21 g/dL. No difference was seen on the basis of gender. During the 4-hour interval after birth, hematocrit/hemoglobin values of late preterm and term neonates (35–42 weeks' gestation) increased by 3.6% ± 0.5% (mean ± SD), those of neonates of 29 to 34 weeks' gestation remained unchanged, and those of < 29 weeks' gestation decreased by 6.0% ± 0.3%. During the first 28 days after birth, an approximately linear decrease in hematocrit/hemoglobin occurred.

Conclusions

The figures presented herein describe reference ranges for hematocrit and blood hemoglobin concentration during the neonatal period, accounting for gestational and postnatal age.

### International values for haemoglobin distributions in healthy pregnant women [^111hL9q5]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to produce maternal Hb thresholds based on populations selected using the WHO prescriptive approach for the construction of international standards. We present international, gestational age-specific centiles for Hb in pregnancy, which are compatible with good, functional, maternal and perinatal outcomes, as well as neonatal and early childhood morbidity, growth and development up to 2 years of age.

### Hemoglobinopathies in the neonate [^117SDBHi]. NeoReviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Hemoglobinopathies in neonates constitute a group of disorders influenced by genetic mutations in the human globin genes. They are often broadly categorized into quantitative defects or qualitative defects, though they are not mutually exclusive. In quantitative defects, the mutation causes insufficient production of a normal globin chain, which can range from no production to mild deficiency. These are typically referred to as thalassemias. In qualitative defects, the structure of the hemoglobin is altered. The most common structural hemoglobinopathy is sickle cell disease. During fetal development, distinct globin chains are synthesized, which undergo a progressive switch to adult globin chains perinatally. This affects the timing of the clinical presentation of these disorders and thus, our ability to diagnose them. In this review, we focus on the epidemiology, genetic causes, clinical presentation, and general overview and management of common hemoglobin disorders that may be encountered in the neonatal period.

### Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine (SMFM) clinical guideline # 8: the fetus at risk for anemia – diagnosis and management [^114HfyNW]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Medium credibility.

Fetal hemoglobin reference ranges by gestational age — Concentrations are provided in grams per deciliter with median 1.0 multiple of the median (MoM) and MoM thresholds to classify anemia. Normal and anemia thresholds are specified as follows: "Normal hemoglobin values were 0.84 MoM or greater; mild anemia: Hgb values were between 0.65 and 0.84 MoM; and severe anemia: Hgb values were 0.55 MoM or less". Example values: at 30 weeks, the 1.0 MoM median is 12.8, with 0.55 MoM 7.1, 0.65 MoM 8.3, and 0.84 MoM 10.8.

### The CBC: reference ranges for neonates [^111nsFP7]. Seminars in Perinatology (2009). Low credibility.

"Normal values" for blood parameters of neonates are generally unavailable, because blood is not usually drawn on healthy, normal neonates to establish normal ranges. Instead, "reference ranges" are used, consisting of the 5th to the 95th percentile values compiled from tests performed on neonatal patients with minimal pathology, under the premise that such ranges approximate normal values. In recent years, we have been seeking to establish reference ranges for various elements of the complete blood count (CBC) of neonates, using the large databases of Intermountain Healthcare, a health care system in the western United States. Establishing these reference ranges has been facilitated by using modern hematology analyzers and electronic data repositories of clinical and laboratory information. The present review brings together several of our recent reports, displaying reference ranges for elements of the CBC among neonates at various gestational and postnatal ages.

### Defining normal healthy term newborn automated hematologic reference intervals at 24 hours of life [^116RF846]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Context —

Automated analyzers have advanced the field of clinical hematology, mandating updated complete blood count (CBC) reference intervals (RIs) to be clinically useful. Contemporary newborn CBC RI publications are mostly retrospective, which some authors have cited as one of their cardinal limitations and recommended future prospective studies.

Objective —

To prospectively establish accurate hematologic RIs for normal healthy term newborns at 24 hours of life given the limitations of the current medical literature.

Design —

This prospective study was conducted at an academic tertiary care center, and hematology samples were collected from 120 participants deemed to be normal healthy term newborns. Distributions were assessed for normality and tested for outliers. Reference intervals were values between the 2.5th percentile and 97.5th percentile.

Results —

The novel RIs obtained for this study population are as follows: absolute immature granulocyte count, 80/μL to 1700/μL; immature granulocyte percentage, 0.6% to 6.1%; reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent, 31.7 to 38.4 pg; immature reticulocyte fraction, 35.9% to 52.8%; immature platelet count, 4.73 × 10³/μL to 19.72 × 10³/μL; and immature platelet fraction, 1.7% to 9.8%.

Conclusions —

This prospective study has defined hematologic RIs for this newborn population, including new advanced clinical parameters from the Sysmex XN-1000 Automated Hematology Analyzer. These RIs are proposed as the new standard and can serve as a strong foundation for continued research to further explore their value in diagnosing and managing morbidities such as sepsis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

### Anemia of prematurity: how low is too low? [^113DJgFs]. Journal of Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Anemia of prematurity (AOP) is a common condition with a well-described chronology, nadir hemoglobin levels, and timeline of recovery. However, the underlying pathophysiology and impact of prolonged exposure of the developing infant to low levels of hemoglobin remains unclear. Phlebotomy losses exacerbate the gradual decline of hemoglobin levels which is insidious in presentation, often without any clinical signs. Progressive anemia in preterm infants is associated with poor weight gain, inability to take oral feeds, tachycardia and exacerbation of apneic, and bradycardic events. There remains a lack of consensus on treatment thresholds for RBC transfusion which vary considerably. This review elaborates on the current state of the problem, its implication for the premature infant including association with subphysiologic cerebral tissue oxygenation, necrotizing enterocolitis, and retinopathy of prematurity. It outlines the impact of prophylaxis and treatment of anemia of prematurity and offers suggestions on improving monitoring and management of the condition.

### International values for haemoglobin distributions in healthy pregnant women [^114Cn7yB]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The US CDC cut-offs were derived from gestational month-specific 5 th centile values for pooled Hb data from four small European studies (UK 1982, n = 45; Sweden 1975, n = 50; Finland 1980, n = 32; Finland 1977, n = 267) involving 'healthy' women. The trimester-specific cut-offs were based on the mid-trimester values; cut-offs for the first trimester, when most women were initially seen for antenatal care, were based on a late-trimester value.

The need for better quality data to redefine the cut-offs in both pregnancy and childhood has been recognised for some time. In 2015, WHO initiated a project to review the Hb concentration cut-offs used to define anaemia in individuals and populations; review its social, biological, behavioural, environmental, and contextual determinants, and assess the expected impact of public health interventions for preventing and controlling anaemia and Hb concentrations. In 2018, experts, policymakers and programme implementers met to review key information and identify knowledge gaps relating to the diagnosis of anaemia. The paucity of data relating maternal, newborn and child health outcomes to Hb values was also confirmed in a recent review, which stressed that not enough is known about the gestational age-specific Hb thresholds that predict health risk/protection for mother and infant.

### Maternal low and high hemoglobin concentrations and associations with adverse maternal and infant health outcomes: an updated global systematic review and meta-analysis [^112EavXm]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Both low and high hemoglobin concentrations were associated with adverse maternal and infant health outcomes. Our work builds on prior evidence on the importance of maintaining a healthy maternal Hb concentration from preconception to delivery. Further research is needed to define cutoffs for both anemia and high Hb and implement effective interventions to optimize healthy Hb ranges during pregnancy.

### Management of the surgical newborn: physiological foundations and practical considerations [^113ZjGiX]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2010). Low credibility.

The unique physiological changes that occur at birth and the adaptations that come in the first weeks of life profoundly affect the clinical management of the surgical newborn patient. The newborn has adaptive challenges that have to be met at birth: (a) establish a functional residual capacity and breathe; (b) change from a fetal to a newborn circulatory circuit; (c) change from fetal hemoglobin to hemoglobin A; (d) sustain a heart rate dependent cardiac output; (e) maintain normal body temperature; establish renal function and regulate postnatal body fluid composition; (f) establish hepatic function; and (g) maintain normal vital signs. Classical physiological studies of the last century describe the physiological basis of these adaptive tasks, and support practical considerations that we follow in clinical practice.

### Haemoglobin and red blood cell reference intervals during infancy [^115q3SGi]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

There is a need for updated haematological reference data in infancy. This study aimed to define intervals for haemoglobin and red blood cell biomarkers based on data from a large cohort of longitudinally followed Swedish infants.

Design

Longitudinal cohort study.

Setting

Two Swedish study centres.

Participants

Three community-based populations including 442 presumably healthy infants born at term and with umbilical cord clamping delayed to 30 s or more after birth.

Methods

Blood samples were collected from umbilical cord blood (a), at 48–118 hours (b), at 4 months (c) and at 12 months (d). Reference intervals as the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles were calculated in coherence with Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines.

Results

Reference intervals for haemoglobin (g/L) were: (a) 116–189, (b) 147–218, (c) 99–130, (d) 104–134, and for mean cell volume (fL): (a) 97–118, (b) 91–107, (c) 71–85, (d) 70–83. Reference intervals for erythrocyte counts, reticulocyte counts, reticulocyte haemoglobin, mean cell haemoglobin and mean cell haemoglobin concentration were also estimated. According to the WHO definition of anaemia, a haemoglobin value less than 110 g/L, 16% of this presumably healthy cohort could be classified as anaemic at 12 months.

Conclusion

We found mainly narrower reference intervals compared with previously published studies. The reference intervals for each parameter varied according to the infants' age, demonstrating the necessity of age definitions when presenting infant reference intervals. The discrepancy with the WHO classification for anaemia at 12 months, despite favourable conditions in infancy, needs future investigation.

### Umbilical cord pH, blood gases, and lactate at birth: normal values, interpretation, and clinical utility [^116YQ7fd]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Normal birth is a eustress reaction, a beneficial hedonic stress with extremely high catecholamines that protects us from intrauterine hypoxia and assists in the rapid shift to extrauterine life. Occasionally the cellular O 2 requirement becomes critical and an O 2 deficit in blood (hypoxemia) may evolve to a tissue deficit (hypoxia) and finally a risk of organ damage (asphyxia). An increase in H + concentration is reflected in a decrease in pH, which together with increased base deficit is a proxy for the level of fetal O 2 deficit. Base deficit (or its negative value, base excess) was introduced to reflect the metabolic component of a low pH and to distinguish from the respiratory cause of a low pH, which is a high CO 2 concentration. Base deficit is a theoretical estimate and not a measured parameter, calculated by the blood gas analyzer from values of pH, the partial pressure of CO 2, and hemoglobin. Different brands of analyzers use different calculation equations, and base deficit values can thus differ by multiples. This could influence the diagnosis of metabolic acidosis, which is commonly defined as a pH < 7.00 combined with a base deficit ≥ 12.0 mmol/L in umbilical cord arterial blood. Base deficit can be calculated as base deficit in blood (or actual base deficit) or base deficit in extracellular fluid (or standard base deficit). The extracellular fluid compartment represents the blood volume diluted with the interstitial fluid. Base deficit in extracellular fluid is advocated for fetal blood because a high partial pressure of CO 2 (hypercapnia) is common in newborns without concomitant hypoxia, and hypercapnia has a strong influence on the pH value, then termed respiratory acidosis. An increase in partial pressure of CO 2 causes less increase in base deficit in extracellular fluid than in base deficit in blood, thus base deficit in extracellular fluid better represents the metabolic component of acidosis. The different types of base deficit for defining metabolic acidosis in cord blood have unfortunately not been noticed by many obstetrical experts and organizations. In addition to an increase in H + concentration, the lactate production is accelerated during hypoxia and anaerobic metabolism. There is no global consensus on definitions of normal cord blood gases and lactate, and different cutoff values for abnormality are used. At a pH < 7.20, 7% to 9% of newborns are deemed academic; at < 7.10, 1% to 3%; and at < 7.00, 0.26% to 1.3%. From numerous studies of different eras and sizes, it can firmly be concluded that in the cord artery, the statistically defined lower pH limit (mean -2 standard deviations) is 7.10. Given that the pH for optimal enzyme activity differs between different cell types and organs, it seems difficult to establish a general biologically critical pH limit. The blood gases and lactate in cord blood change with the progression of pregnancy toward a mixed metabolic and respiratory acidemia because of increased metabolism and CO 2 production in the growing fetus. Gestational age-adjusted normal reference values have accordingly been published for pH and lactate, and they associate with Apgar score slightly better than stationary cutoffs, but they are not widely used in clinical practice. On the basis of good-quality data, it is reasonable to set a cord artery lactate cutoff (mean +2 standard deviations) at 10 mmol/L at 39 to 40 weeks' gestation. For base deficit, it is not possible to establish statistically defined reference values because base deficit is calculated with different equations, and there is no consensus on which to use. Arterial cord blood represents the fetus better than venous blood, and samples from both vessels are needed to validate the arterial origin. A venoarterial pH gradient of < 0.02 is commonly used to differentiate arterial from venous samples. Reference values for pH in cord venous blood have been determined, but venous blood comes from the placenta after clearance of a surplus of arterial CO 2, and base deficit in venous blood then overestimates the metabolic component of fetal acidosis. The ambition to increase neonatal hemoglobin and iron depots by delaying cord clamping after birth results in falsely acidic blood gas and lactate values if the blood sampling is also delayed. Within seconds after birth, sour metabolites accumulated in peripheral tissues and organs will flood into the central circulation and further to the cord arteries when the newborn starts to breathe, move, and cry. This influence of "hidden acidosis" can be avoided by needle puncture of unclamped cord vessels and blood collection immediately after birth. Because of a continuing anaerobic glycolysis in the collected blood, it should be analyzed within 5 minutes to not result in a falsely high lactate value. If the syringe is placed in ice slurry, the time limit is 20 minutes. For pH, it is reasonable to wait no longer than 15 minutes if not in ice. Routine analyses of cord blood gases enable perinatal audits to gain the wisdom of hindsight, to maintain quality assurance at a maternity unit over years by following the rate of neonatal acidosis, to compare results between hospitals on regional or national bases, and to obtain an objective outcome measure in clinical research. Given that the intrapartum cardiotocogram is an uncertain proxy for fetal hypoxia, and there is no strong correlation between pathologic cardiotocograms and fetal acidosis, a cord artery pH may help rather than hurt a staff person subjected to a malpractice suit based on undesirable cardiotocogram patterns. Contrary to common beliefs and assumptions, up to 90% of cases of cerebral palsy do not originate from intrapartum events. Future research will elucidate whether cell injury markers with point-of-care analysis will become valuable in improving the dating of perinatal injuries and differentiating hypoxic from nonhypoxic injuries.

### International values for haemoglobin distributions in healthy pregnant women [^112Xjn1m]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Anaemia in pregnancy is a global health problem with associated morbidity and mortality.

Methods

A secondary analysis of prospective, population-based study from 2009 to 2016 to generate maternal haemoglobin normative centiles in uncomplicated pregnancies in women receiving optimal antenatal care. Pregnant women were enrolled < 14 weeks' gestation in the Fetal Growth Longitudinal Study (FGLS) of the INTERGROWTH-21 st Project which involved eight geographically diverse urban areas in Brazil, China, India, Italy, Kenya, Oman, United Kingdom and United States. At each 5 ± 1 weekly visit until delivery, information was collected about the pregnancy, as well as the results of blood tests taken as part of routine antenatal care that complemented the study's requirements, including haemoglobin values.

Findings

A total of 3502 (81%) of 4321 women who delivered a live, singleton newborn with no visible congenital anomalies, contributed at least one haemoglobin value. Median haemoglobin concentrations ranged from 114.6 to 121.4 g/L, 94 to 103 g/L at the 3 rd centile, and from 135 to 141 g/L at the 97 th centile. The lowest values were seen between 31 and 32 weeks' gestation, representing a mean drop of 6.8 g/L compared to 14 weeks' gestation. The percentage variation in maternal haemoglobin within-site was 47% of the total variance compared to 13% between sites.

Interpretation

We have generated International, gestational age-specific, smoothed centiles for maternal haemoglobin concentration compatible with better pregnancy outcomes, as well as adequate neonatal and early childhood morbidity, growth and development up to 2 years of age.

Funding

Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Grant number 49038.

### Tunisian newborn's cord blood: reference values of complete blood count and hemoglobin fractions [^114zpLsn]. American Journal of Perinatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study was aimed to establish local reference values for hematological indices and hemoglobin (Hb) fractions in umbilical cord blood (UCB) for the northern population of Tunisia.

Study Design

Our study included full-term newborns by vaginal deliveries. Hematological parameters were collected using an automated blood cell counter. The amounts of Hb fractions were measured by capillary electrophoresis of Hb. Statistical analysis was performed using R software.

Results

A total of 328 cord blood samples were analyzed. Among them, 154 (male: 44.8%, female: 55.2%) were used to establish reference values. The normal reference values of complete blood count (CBC) and Hb fractions were calculated. Mean neonatal Hb was 14.75 ± 2.26g/dL. Gestational age affects the expression of CBC values as red blood cell (RBC), Hb, hematocrit (Hct), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), white blood cell (WBC), and the Hb profile. Umbilical blood hemogram parameters and Hb profile are affected by the environment; higher in newborns from urban regions but not affected by gender ratio.

Conclusion

Reference ranges of normal CBC indices and Hb fractions have been successfully established in Tunisian neonates' UCB. Our data suggest reference values that could be useful for neonatal patients' laboratory results and clinical interpretation.

Key Points

· Reference values for CBC and hemoglobin fractions have been established. · Hematological reference for UCB is useful to identify hemolytic anemia cases early. · UCB hematological values are influenced by gestational age and probably by environmental factors.

### Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity levels in white newborn infants [^112q6SNA]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To define normal levels of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity in a population of North American white newborns.

Study Design

We studied 2 white newborn populations, ≥ 35 weeks of gestation. In the retrospective study, G6PD activity was measured (on clinical indication) in 242 newborns aged ≤ 7 days. In the prospective study, we measured G6PD activity in umbilical cord blood samples in 347 newborns and daily transcutaneous bilirubin levels in these infants.

Results

The mean G6PD activity level was 12.3 ± 3.1 units per gram hemoglobin (U/gHb) in the retrospective population and 13.3 ± 1.8 U/gHb in the prospective population, and there was no difference between males and females. The distribution of values suggested that infants with activity levels < 7 U/gHb should be considered deficient and 8 infants (6 males and 2 females), all in the retrospective population had such levels.

Conclusions

As in other ethnic populations, the mean G6PD activity in white newborn infants is substantially greater than that of white adults. The lower limits of normal are also similar to those of other newborn ethnic groups and of adults. The diagnosis of G6PD deficiency should be considered in any white infant whose G6PD activity is < 7 U/gHb.

### Hematological reference ranges in black very low birth weight infants [^1123KXVj]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

This study compared hematological reference ranges in black very low birth weight infants to previously published values established predominantly on white subjects. Ninety-four healthy, black, premature babies with a birth weight of 800 to 1500 g at 2–7 days of age were enrolled as part of a study comparing blood transfusions and high- versus low-dose recombinant erythropoietin in anaemia of prematurity. Peripheral venous blood was collected for a full blood count and differential, fetal hemoglobin and erythropoietin levels. The hematological parameters observed in black very low birth weight neonates are similar to previously published reference ranges, except that lower limits of normal were observed for hemoglobin and the red cell indices.

### Clinical practice guideline for red blood cell transfusion thresholds in very preterm neonates [^112vSP7r]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is a common medical intervention to treat anemia in very preterm neonates; however, best transfusion practices, such as thresholds, remain uncertain.

Objective

To develop recommendations for clinicians on the use of RBC transfusions in very preterm neonates.

Evidence Review

An international steering committee reviewed evidence from a systematic review of 6 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that compared high vs low hemoglobin-based or hematocrit-based transfusion thresholds. The steering committee reached consensus on certainty-of-evidence ratings and worked with a panel from stakeholder organizations on reviewing the evidence. With input from parent representatives and the stakeholder panel, the steering committee used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to develop recommendations.

Findings

A systematic review of 6 RCTs encompassing 3483 participants (1759 females [51.3%]; mean [SD] age range, 25.9–29.8 [1.5–3.0] weeks) was used as the basis of the recommendations. The ranges for higher hemoglobin concentration (liberal) vs lower hemoglobin concentration (restrictive) threshold study arms were similar across the trials. However, specific thresholds differed based on the severity of illness, which was defined using variable criteria in the trials. There was moderate certainty of evidence that low transfusion thresholds likely had little to no difference in important short-term and long-term outcomes. The recommended hemoglobin thresholds varied on the basis of postnatal week and respiratory support needs. At postnatal weeks 1, 2, and 3 or more, for neonates on respiratory support, the recommended thresholds were 11, 10, and 9 g/dL, respectively; for neonates on no or minimal respiratory support, the recommended thresholds were 10, 8.5, and 7 g/dL, respectively (to convert hemoglobin to grams per liter, multiply by 10.0).

Conclusions and Relevance

This consensus statement recommends a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy, with moderate certainty of evidence, for preterm neonates with less than 30 weeks' gestation.

### Reference intervals for reticulocyte hemoglobin content in healthy infants [^115UrwRR]. Pediatric Research (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Iron deficiency anemia in childhood is a serious public health problem worldwide. Reticulocyte hemoglobin content (Ret-He) is a novel biomarker of iron deficiency adopted for adults but there is a lack of reference intervals for Ret-He in infants. The aim of this study was to provide data from healthy infants.

Methods

Swedish infants (n = 456), born at term after normal pregnancies were included. Ret-He was measured at birth (umbilical cord sample), 48–72h, 4 months, and 12 months. Reference intervals were calculated as ± 2 standard deviations from the mean of Ret-He.

Results

Reference intervals for newborn Ret-He were 27.4 to 36.0pg/L (N = 376) in the cord sample, 28.1–37.7pg/L (N = 253) at 48–72h, 25.6–33.4pg/L (N = 341) at four months and 24.9–34.1pg/L (N = 288) at 12 months. Ret-He was significantly lower among iron-deficient infants, at 4 months mean difference (95% CI) -4.2pg/L (-6.1 to -2.4) and at 12 months mean difference (95% CI) -3.4pg/L (-5.0 to -1.8).

Conclusions

This longitudinal study presents Ret-He reference intervals based on non-anemic and non-iron-deficient infants and constitutes a step towards standardizing Ret-He as a pre-anemia biomarker of iron deficiency in children.

### Screening for iron deficiency anemia in young children: USPSTF recommendation statement [^114aKFku]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening tests for iron deficiency anemia in infants and young children — test performance and limitations indicate that serum hemoglobin or hematocrit is the primary screening test for iron deficiency anemia, but hemoglobin is not sensitive for detecting iron deficiency and is also nonspecific, as ~60% of cases of anemia result from causes other than iron deficiency. The positive predictive value of low hemoglobin for iron deficiency in children age 12 months ranges from 10% to 40%, and in infants, particularly before age 12 months, spontaneous resolution of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia reduces the positive predictive value of any screening test. Other single tests as primary screening tools have not been well studied, and serum ferritin acts as an acute-phase reactant and should ideally be measured in the absence of infection or inflammation.

G6PD deficiency — timing of repeat testing after hemolysis or exchange transfusion: Measuring the G6PD activity during or soon after the hemolytic event or after an exchange transfusion can lead to a falsely normal result; if G6PD deficiency is strongly suspected but the measurement of G6PD activity is normal or close to normal, the G6PD activity should be measured at least 3 months later.

### New approach to accurate interpretation of sickle cell disease newborn screening by applying multiple of median cutoffs and ratios [^114MkVET]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The main goal of newborn screening (NBS) for sickle cell disease (SCD) is to detect affected neonates so that specific preventive care can be implemented. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) used for NBS has high sensitivity and specificity, but we lack guidelines for quantitative hemoglobin (Hb) fraction interpretation. The purpose of this study was to determine cutoff values to standardize quantitative interpretation in SCD NBS for different clinical situation such as, red blood cell transfusion or beta-thalassemia, which can be real screening pitfalls.

Methods

Retrospective study of 75,026 samples from the neonatal screening program analyzed in our laboratory. Precise HbA and HbS percentages at birth were recorded and median values established for each gestational age, allowing percentage results to be expressed in normal gestation-specific multiples of the median (MoM). Three threshold values of clinical interest were determined.

Results

High levels of HbA (> 2.5 MoM) allowed identification of newborns who received transfusions. Low levels of HbS (≤ 0.7 MoM) allowed detection of the association between HbS and other mutations of the beta-globin gene (i.e. HbHope, β0-thalassemia, etc.). An HbA/HbS ratio < 0.5 to distinguish healthy carriers from SCD with S/β+-thalassemia. The screening accuracy for each threshold was established. The screening accuracy of low-level HbA, which is determinant in identifying the subgroup of patients at risk of β-thalassemia, will be determined prospectively.

Conclusions

This new approach introduces tools for a quantitative interpretation in SCD NBS by HPLC methods and could allow standardization of interpretation between centers.

### International values for haemoglobin distributions in healthy pregnant women [^114j2iUL]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

The gestational age-specific centiles for maternal Hb presented here, are based on a population-based, prospective study throughout pregnancy of 3502 healthy, well-nourished women from eight countries, whose healthy babies were followed up to 2 years of age. The methods for selecting the sample of women adhered strictly to the WHO prescriptive approach used for the construction of the WHO Child Growth Standards, which supports the universal applicability of our findings.

Despite the many factors affecting Hb concentrations, we found remarkable similarities among populations compared with a large within-population variability, in common with other biomarkers of nutritional status. We also observed a moderate nadir of maternal Hb between 31 and 32 weeks' gestation as previously reported. The nadir by 31 weeks' gestation resulted from a drop of 6.8 g/L at the 50 th centile compared to values at 14 weeks' gestation, which is similar to the drop from < 110 g/L to < 105 g/L between the first and second trimesters in the current WHO and CDC guidelines for antenatal care.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^113nyYiu]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, more specifically with respect to phototherapy (monitoring of treatment), AAP 2022 guidelines recommend to measure hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, or CBC to assess for the presence of anemia and to provide a baseline in case subsequent anemia develops in infants requiring phototherapy.

### Haemoglobin and red blood cell reference intervals during infancy [^111vvn7Y]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Childhood anaemia is a global health problem that affects young children in both low-income and high-income countries and is associated with cognitive deficits and suboptimal development. The currently used threshold for anaemia, as defined by the WHO, originates from studies published more than 60 years ago and has remained. When the initial recommendations were published, the WHO reported that the threshold for anaemia, a haemoglobin (Hb) level below 110 g/L, was rather arbitrarily chosen. Data were mainly based on a study that included 96 infants, 6 months old, published in 1959. However, later studies indicate that the level defined as anaemia, that is, an Hb value below the 2.5th percentile, is lower than the currently recommended WHO threshold. This important knowledge gap needs further investigation. But, creating reference data in average childhood populations is associated with ethical and practical difficulties. Recently, Zierk et al added important insights to the continuous changes in haematology reference intervals observed during the rapid development after birth. Their calculations were based on laboratory information systems in 10 German centres and included data from 358 292 paediatric patients. The researchers were unable to compare the results from their new hospital data-based approach, with modern reference limits based on established methodology from healthy infant data.

The timing of umbilical cord clamping affects Hb levels during the first months of life. During the last decade, the preventive effects of delaying umbilical cord clamping have again received increased attention as a method for preventing infant anaemia. It is well known that delayed clamping is associated with an increase in blood volume by placental transfusion, promoting more favourable haematological conditions in infancy. Also, other infant characteristics may also need to be considered, since especially the indices mean cell volume (MCV) and mean cell Hb concentration (MCHC) are influenced by an infant's gestational age at birth.

The influence of the timing of cord clamping on reference limits is rarely accounted for in infant studies, although in the study on which the WHO recommendation was mainly based, it was noted that the umbilical cord was not clamped 'until all pulsations had ceased'.

### Cutoff value for correcting white blood cell count for nucleated red blood cells: what is it? Why is it important? [^117UxPoQ]. Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Nucleated red blood cells (RBCs) are normally observed in the peripheral blood of neonates and during pregnancy. Under other conditions, the presence of nucleated RBCs in circulating blood indicates disorder in the blood-producing mechanism. The increased presence of nucleated RBCs, however, falsely elevates the leukocyte count, as measured by most automated hematology analyzers, warranting a manual correction of the leukocyte count. For a long time, cutoff values for correcting white blood cell (WBC) count for the presence of nucleated RBCs have been used regularly, particularly in developing countries. However, because those values are largely subjective, they can vary widely between laboratories worldwide. These varied cutoff values include 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50; it appears that the numbers 5 and 10 are the most common values used in corrections; the reasons require further elucidation. In this article, we discuss the merits of correcting the WBC count for nucleated RBCs at certain cutoff points.

### Adapting iron dose supplementation in pregnancy for greater effectiveness on mother and child health: protocol of the ECLIPSES randomized clinical trial [^115yttmC]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Our hypotheses are that:

1) In women without anemia at the start of the pregnancy, with normal hemoglobin values of between 110–130 g/L, an iron intake of 40 or 80 mg/d, depending on the initial serum ferritin levels and on the presence of genetic alterations in the HFE gene, would be more effective in preventing iron deficiency, without increasing the risk of hemoconcentration by the end of pregnancy. This would help optimize mother-child health status.

2) In women without anemia and with normal-high values of hemoglobin of > 130 g/L, an iron intake of 20 or 40 mg/d, depending on the initial serum ferritin levels and on the presence of genetic alterations in the HFE gene, will be more effective in ameliorating the risk of hemoconcentration by the end of the pregnancy, without leading to iron deficiency.

Objective

The objective of the study is to determine the best grade of effectiveness (on mother-newborn health status), of an iron supplement adapted to the hemoglobin levels at the start of the pregnancy, relative to the usually-prescribed dose.

### Addressing anemia in high-altitude populations: global impact, prevalence, challenges, and potential solutions [^116XHNu4]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

This high prevalence among children and pregnant women is further complicated by the occurrence of two specific forms of anemia that have been observed exclusively in these groups: "physiological anemia" and "pathological anemia". In pregnant women, "physiological anemia" is caused by a hemodilution process, leading to Hb values below the threshold defined by the WHO, although this condition is considered normal. Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is the main form of Hb during fetal development and is gradually replaced by adult hemoglobin (HbA) after birth. By around 6 months of age, HbF levels typically decrease to less than 1% in normal populations, with most Hb being HbA (approximately 96%) and HbA2 making up 2.5%–3.5%. Therefore, hemolysis associated with elevated HbF levels is not characteristic of healthy children beyond infancy. The original claim about hemolysis due to elevated HbF in children under 5 has been adjusted to align with these facts. This normal process results in Hb values falling below the threshold defined by the WHO, classifying it as anemia. This postnatal adjustment, described by Joseph Barcroft in 1932 as "Everest in utero", is a normal physiological response rather than a sign of disease. During this period, neonates possess high iron stores, almost double (75 mg/kg) that of adults, which adequately support erythropoiesis in early life. Thus, dietary iron primarily serves to replace small daily iron losses and support growth needs. In most cases, this modest requirement is sufficiently met through breastfeeding.

In contrast, pathological anemia refers to reductions in Hb concentration due to underlying pathological processes and typically requires clinical evaluation and treatment. The causes of pathological anemia are diverse, ranging from conditions that induce blood loss, shorten red blood cell lifespan, or hinder Hb synthesis and red blood cell production. These include chronic inflammation, which disrupts iron metabolism through elevated hepcidin levels and impairs iron absorption — rendering oral iron supplementation less effective. Other etiologies include chronic kidney disease (which reduces erythropoietin production), gastrointestinal disorders (that impair nutrient absorption), malaria (which accelerates hemolysis), hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia, red blood cell membrane disorders, red blood cell channelopathies, red blood cell enzyme deficiencies, and infections with neglected tropical diseases such as schistosomiasis and hookworm. These diverse causes reflect the multifactorial nature of pathological anemia, which varies according to age, physiological status, and regional disease burden.

Intrauterine transfusion — hematocrit targets and thresholds — In general, the final target hematocrit should be approximately 40 — 50%. If the fetal hematocrit is greater than 30%, no transfusion is necessary, although a resampling may be recommended within 1 — 2 weeks, depending on the clinical circumstances, and transfusion to higher levels has been associated with a theoretical increased risk of complications.

### The association between maternal anemia and neonatal anemia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111y1qeC]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Importance

Neonatal anemia has a long-term effect on children's growth and development. Anemia during pregnancy is also the most widespread nutritional deficiency among pregnant women in the world; If it leads to anemia in newborns, it will affect a wide range of people and be a public health problem worthy of attention.

Objective

To study the relationship between maternal anemia during pregnancy and neonatal hemoglobin levels.

Data Sources

PubMed, Web of science, Scopus, MEDLINE, Embase, ProQuest, Dissertations & Theses Global, The Cochrane Library, China Biology Medicine Database, Chinese CNKI Database, and Chinese Wanfang Database were systematically searched from inception to August 31, 2022.

Study Selection

The meta-analysis included all original studies which pertain to cohort studies, case-control studies or cross-sectional studies that investigated the relationship between maternal anemia during pregnancy and neonatal hemoglobin levels.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Hemoglobin level of both anemic and non-anemic pregnant mothers and their paired newborns were pooled from the selected studies. The random-effects model was used to assess the risk of getting a lower neonatal hemoglobin level between mothers with and without pregnant anemia. Data analyses were performed from September 5, 2022, to March 10, 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Maternal anemia during pregnancy is a risk factor of lower neonatal hemoglobin levels.

Results

The initial search yielded 4267 records of which 116 articles underwent full-text evaluation, which identified 18 articles and a total of 1873 patients that were included. The findings of the meta-analysis showed a significant difference between the two groups(MD = -1.38; 95%CI:[-1.96,-0.80]. p < 0.01), while the co-effect showed that the neonatal hemoglobin value of anemic mothers was 1.38g/dL lower than that of non-anemic mothers(-1.96,-0.80), suggesting a correlation between maternal anemia lower neonatal hemoglobin levels.

Conclusions and Relevance

This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that maternal anemia during pregnancy were associated with a lower level of newborn hemoglobin levels. This may enable a better understanding of neonatal anemia and provide guidance towards future development of nutritional supplementation during pregnancy and the prediction of postpartum outcomes.

### Low versus high haemoglobin concentration threshold for blood transfusion for preventing morbidity and mortality in very low birth weight infants [^111GMpTT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Infants of very low birth weight often receive multiple transfusions of red blood cells, usually in response to predetermined haemoglobin or haematocrit thresholds. In the absence of better indices, haemoglobin levels are imperfect but necessary guides to the need for transfusion. Chronic anaemia in premature infants may, if severe, cause apnoea, poor neurodevelopmental outcomes or poor weight gain. On the other hand, red blood cell transfusion may result in transmission of infections, circulatory or iron overload, or dysfunctional oxygen carriage and delivery.

Objectives

To determine if erythrocyte transfusion administered to maintain low as compared to high haemoglobin thresholds reduces mortality or morbidity in very low birth weight infants enrolled within three days of birth.

Search Methods

Two review authors independently searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and conference proceedings through June 2010.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of early versus late, or restrictive versus liberal erythrocyte transfusion regimes in low birth weight infants applied within three days of birth, with mortality or major morbidity as outcomes.

### Quantitative neonatal glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase screening: distribution, reference values, and classification by phenotype [^114EqtaU]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine enzyme assay reference values for newborns in a Sephardic Jewish population at high risk for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.

Study Design

Quantitative G6PD testing was performed on umbilical cord blood. The reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase, reflecting G6PD activity, was measured spectrophotometrically. Hemoglobin (Hb) was measured on the same sample. G6PD activity was recorded as U/g Hb.

Results

Males (N = 1502) were separated into 2 distinct groups: those < 7 U/g Hb (n = 243 [16.2%], median 0.28 U/g Hb), designated G6PD deficient, presumably hemizygotes; and those ≥ 9 U/g Hb (n = 1256 [83.8%], 18.76 U/g Hb), designated G6PD normal, presumably hemizygotes. Female (n = 1298) values were a continuum and were categorized based on the male distribution: those < 7 U/g Hb (n = 81 [6.2%], 4.84 U/g Hb), G6PD deficient, probably homozogytes; those ≥ 9.5 U/g Hb, equivalent to 50% of the male normal value, (n = 1153 (88.8%), 18.36 U/g Hb), G6PD normal, probably homozygotes; and those with intermediate values (n = 64 [4.9%], 8.61 U/g Hb), probable heterozygotes.

Conclusions

Accurate identification of the male G6PD-deficient state was possible despite high normal neonatal G6PD values. Female values were presented as a continuum preventing accurate classification but were classified based on male phenotype for practical use.

### Prevalence and associated factors of anemia among newborns in Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116sCgnK]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anemia is a condition in which the number of Red Blood Cells (RBCs) or the hemoglobin concentration within them is lower than normal. The optimal hemoglobin level required to meet physiological needs varies by age, sex, residence, smoking habits, and pregnancy status.

The global prevalence of anemia in children under five was 39.8%, equivalent to 269 million children with anemia. The prevalence of anemia among newborns was between 50 and 80% in developing countries, and the highest prevalence was observed in the African region, ranging from 23.4% to 66%.

The cause of anemia in newborns is multifactorial, including nutritional deficiencies, hemorrhage, hemolysis, failure of red cell production, hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease, and maternal and neonatal infections. In Africa, anemia in neonates is often associated with maternal anemia, inadequate nutritional status, and various infectious diseases, particularly malaria. Moreover, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is a genetic disorder that affects red blood cells and is a significant cause of mild to severe anemia in newborns. Anti-D alloantibodies are the most common cause of alloimmunization to Rh blood group antigens in newborn anemia with fetal erythroblastosis.

### Pathophysiology of anemia during the neonatal period, including anemia of prematurity [^1172Dnbo]. NeoReviews (2008). Low credibility.

This review summarizes the current thinking about the causes of anemia universally experienced by preterm infants in the early postnatal weeks. In addition to describing developmentally determined physiologic processes contributing to anemia of prematurity, this review discusses clinically important nonphysiologic contributors to anemia experienced by preterm infants during the neonatal period. Chief among these and an important contributor to the need for red blood cell transfusions is the heavy laboratory phlebotomy loss sustained shortly after birth, when neonatal cardiorespiratory illness is most severe. Understanding and recognizing the physiologic and nonphysiologic processes contributing to anemia encountered in early postnatal life is important in knowing which treatment and prevention modalities are likely to be most effective in different clinical situations. The evaluation of rare and uncommon acquired and genetic causes of anemia in newborns are not covered in this review.

### Nonpharmacological, blood conservation techniques for preventing neonatal anemia – effective and promising strategies for reducing transfusion [^116gjyZA]. Seminars in Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

The development of anemia after birth in very premature, critically ill newborn infants is a universal well-described phenomenon. Although preventing anemia in this population, along with efforts to establish optimal red blood cell (RBC) transfusion and pharmacologic therapy continue to be actively investigated, the present review focuses exclusively on nonpharmacological approaches to the prevention and treatment of neonatal anemia. We begin with an overview of topics relevant to nonpharmacological techniques. These topics include neonatal and fetoplacental hemoglobin levels and blood volumes, clinical and laboratory practices applied in critically ill neonates, and current RBC transfusion practice guidelines. This is followed by a discussion of the most effective and promising nonpharmacological blood conservation strategies and techniques. Fortunately, many of these techniques are feasible in most neonatal intensive care units. When applied together, these techniques are more effective than existing pharmacotherapies in significantly decreasing neonatal RBC transfusions. They include increasing hemoglobin endowment and circulating blood volume at birth; removing less blood for laboratory testing; and optimizing nutrition.

### Haemoglobin and red blood cell reference intervals during infancy [^116pW2Gc]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2022). Medium credibility.

It is reasonable to assume that the limited number of larger reference interval studies can have implications on what is considered as normative Hb concentration data. In our cohort, 32 of 195 (16%) of the infants at 12 months of age were classified as having mild anaemia with the WHO guidelines, with Hb below 110 g/L. A similar disconcordance to WHO classification is indicated by the 2.5th reference limits found in other studies listed in table 2. This might imply that the WHO threshold can lead to flagging of healthy infant analysis results. The lower reference limit for Hb at 4–12 months in this study is similar to that recommended by the ESPGHAN in this age range (105 g/L). As a group, the infants with Hb < 110 g/L did not have significantly lower iron stores measured as ferritin. Neither did they have upregulated iron need as estimated by transferrin and sTfR concentrations compared with the group with higher Hb. They did have lower serum iron levels and this observation may require further investigation, even though serum iron is usually not regarded as a reliable marker of iron status due to its strong diurnal variation. Future work needs to define Hb thresholds based on clinical needs.

In conclusion, we have defined RBC biomarker reference intervals at four time points during infancy. The reference interval widths are mainly narrower than previously reported for these biomarkers. Based on this comparably large longitudinal cohort study, we suggest that Hb thresholds for infant anaemia between the ages 6 months and 12 months are reinvestigated. Our results also call for the necessity of accurate age partitioning when calculating reference intervals for RBC biomarkers.

### Umbilical cord blood hematological parameters reference interval for newborns from addis ababa, Ethiopia [^116xrWVp]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Reference intervals (RIs) aid in the interpretation of laboratory data in patient management, clinical trials, and selection of eligible participants for vaccine trials. These values are affected by several factors including age, sex, race, geographical location and dietary pattern. A wealth of published studies demonstrated the age related changes in hematological parameters. Neonates exhibit profound quantitative as well as qualitative hematologic differences compared to older children and adults. At birth, hematological parameters of term newborns are significantly higher than those of older children and adults. Thus, it is inappropriate to use adult reference ranges for the assessment of pediatric blood.

On the other hand, utilizing a reference interval obtained from somewhere else to a population of interest could potentially lead to inappropriate patient management and unnecessary use of resources. Cord blood hematological parameters reference intervals are vital in neonatal care and transplantation medicine. Cord blood is a blood collected from long and helical cord that connects the fetus with the mother for substances exchange. Establishing normal neonatal reference interval has been difficult because of drawing blood from healthy neonates. Challenges of getting ethical approval for this vulnerable group and consent from the mothers also explain why limited RIs established from cord blood. Moreover, apart from the neonates other maternal factors are also needed to be considered.

According to different studies, maternal anemia had effect on cord blood hemoglobin and newborn weight, although it has been reported that routine hematological values of newborns are independent to that of maternal hematological values. A likely explanation given by those stating the dependency on maternal status is the high micronutrient intake inadequacy during pregnancy. Maternal factors like smoking habit, heavily drinking alcohol, medical problems like diabetic mellitus, eclampsia, hypertension and mode of delivery and frequency of pregnancy affect the hematological profile of neonates. Delayed cord clamping and umbilical cord milking also affect hematological parameters. Otherwise, cord blood collection is a safe way to collect sample compared to cannula and other vascular catheters which cause thrombophlebitis, infection, and extravasation. Thus, in the current study we used cord blood collection method.

In spite of the fact that reference intervals can play an important role in guiding the assessment of hematological changes in neonatal care, there is no published reference interval for hematological parameters in cord blood of Ethiopians except some earlier efforts from Central Ethiopia and recently from Northwest. This study aimed at providing such intervals for cord blood samples from Addis Ababa.

Distribution of gestational ages at which haemoglobin concentration was measured.

We explored the variation in maternal Hb within and between sites and expressed it as a percentage of the total variance; the within-site variance (47.4% of the total variance) was approximately four times higher than the between-sites' variance (12.8% of the total variance) (Table 2).

Table 2 also includes the variance component analyses similar to those previously reported for other biomarkers of growth and nutrition from early pregnancy to childhood. As can be seen, the percentage of variance for these nutritional biomarkers in healthy, educated and well-nourished populations is several times higher among individuals within a site compared to between sites, with the highest figure (still only 12.8% of the total variance) for Hb in pregnancy.

### Clinical practice guideline for red blood cell transfusion thresholds in very preterm neonates [^114CRGsf]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for red blood cell transfusion, more specifically with respect to preterm infants, NTN 2024 guidelines recommend to use a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy in preterm infants born < 30 weeks of gestation, using the following hemoglobin- and hematocrit-based thresholds:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Postnatal week 1|- 11 g/dL or 33% with respiratory support <br/> - 10 g/dL or 30% with no or minimal respiratory support|
|Postnatal week 2|- 10 g/dL or 30% with respiratory support <br/> - 8.5 g/dL or 25% with no or minimal respiratory support|
|Postnatal week ≥ 3|- 9 g/dL or 27% with respiratory support <br/> - 7 g/dL or 21% with no or minimal respiratory support.|

### Haemoglobin level at birth is associated with short term outcomes and mortality in preterm infants [^114Vf7jq]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting a low Hb level at birth as an independent risk factor for mortality and probability of receiving blood transfusion in preterm infants born at ≤ 32 weeks gestation, irrespective of mode of delivery and time of umbilical cord clamping. Hence, more thought should be given to delayed cord clamping in preterm infants to improve the Hb level at birth, which in turn could reduce mortality and short-term complications of prematurity. The neonatal mortality prediction scores need to be investigated by incorporating Hb level at birth to see whether this increases the robustness of prediction of short-term outcomes and mortality in preterm infants. Further studies are required to investigate the association between Hb level at birth and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.

### Maternal low and high hemoglobin concentrations and associations with adverse maternal and infant health outcomes: an updated global systematic review and meta-analysis [^114HuriJ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Key strengths of this review are the inclusion of both ends of the spectrum for Hb concentrations and the range of adverse outcomes for both the mother and infant. Stratification of results by Hb cutoff and timing of assessment also adds further depth and understanding to these complex relationships. Associations between low Hb and adverse outcomes tend to be stronger earlier in pregnancy while associations between high Hb and adverse outcomes were inconsistent across time points. Mixed findings in the second trimester may point to a need to further examine optimal cutoffs during this period.

Our study is one of the largest systematic reviews to date on this topic, including data collected in 69 different countries over a 30-year time period. As such there is high heterogeneity in our analysis driven by differences in definitions and measurement of exposure (maternal Hb) and outcomes as well as potential true differences by context, perhaps driven by variable etiology of anemia and high Hb. It is important to note that this review examines observational associations that could be confounded by underlying socioeconomic, health or environmental factors and thus cannot establish causality. Furthermore, there are inherent limitations of using dichotomous characterizations of Hb rather than understanding risk across a range of continuous values of Hb. In addition, where data were available we stratified by trimester of pregnancy; however, a closer examination of maternal Hb by week of gestation and application of the new gestational age-specific centiles for maternal hemoglobin concentrations from the INTERGROWTH study would be ideal. Future work with pooled individual level data and standardized adjustment for known confounding factors may allow for greater clarity on associations of hemoglobin level and increased risk of adverse outcomes. Depending on the prevalence of the adverse outcomes, future reporting of relative risk may be preferable. This review is limited by the data available. Notably, there is a lack of data on the etiology of low or high Hb and many gaps remain in understanding the role of timing and cutoffs across preconception and pregnancy. Studies that reported data using multiple Hb cutoffs or time points were more heavily weighted in the overall estimates. Hb is a convenient and widely used biomarker in nutrition and health research, however it remains unclear if the associations with adverse outcomes are being driven by direct alterations in functional Hb for essential functions or by the indirect underlying causes of anemia (e.g. iron deficiency vs. hemoglobinopathy) or high Hb (e.g. excess iron vs. failure of plasma volume expansion). Further research is needed to better understand the implications of the etiology of anemia for redefining optimal Hb cutoffs during pregnancy and optimizing public health programs for women.

### Maternal low and high hemoglobin concentrations and associations with adverse maternal and infant health outcomes: an updated global systematic review and meta-analysis [^116uDv3D]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Growing evidence suggests low and high maternal hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations may have adverse consequences for maternal and child health. There remain questions on specific Hb thresholds to define anemia and high Hb as well as how cutoffs may vary by anemia etiology and timing of assessment.

Methods

We conducted an updated systematic review (using PubMed and Cochrane Review) on low (< 110 g/L) and high (≥ 130 g/L) maternal Hb concentrations and associations with a range of maternal and infant health outcomes. We examined associations by timing of Hb assessment (preconception; first, second, and third trimesters, as well as at any time point in pregnancy), varying cutoffs used for defining low and high hemoglobin concentrations and performed stratified analyses by iron-deficiency anemia. We conducted meta-analyses to obtain odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals.

Results

The updated systematic review included 148 studies. Low maternal Hb at any time point in pregnancy was associated with: low birthweight, LBW (OR (95% CI) 1.28 (1.22–1.35)), very low birthweight, VLBW (2.15 (1.47–3.13)), preterm birth, PTB (1.35 (1.29–1.42)), small-for-gestational age, SGA (1.11 (1.02–1.19)), stillbirth 1.43 (1.24–1.65)), perinatal mortality (1.75 (1.28–2.39)), neonatal mortality (1.25 (1.16–1.34), postpartum hemorrhage (1.69 (1.45–1.97)), transfusion (3.68 (2.58–5.26)), pre-eclampsia (1.57 (1.23–2.01)), and prenatal depression (1.44 (1.24–1.68)). For maternal mortality, the OR was higher for Hb < 90 (4.83 (2.17–10.74)) than for Hb < 100 (2.87 (1.08–7.67)). High maternal Hb was associated with: VLBW (1.35 (1.16–1.57)), PTB (1.12 (1.00–1.25)), SGA (1.17 (1.09–1.25)), stillbirth (1.32 (1.09–1.60)), maternal mortality (2.01 (1.12–3.61)), gestational diabetes (1.71 (1.19–2.46)), and pre-eclampsia (1.34 (1.16–1.56)). Stronger associations were noted earlier in pregnancy for low Hb and adverse birth outcomes while the role of timing of high Hb was inconsistent. Lower Hb cutoffs were associated with greater odds of poor outcomes; for high Hb, data were too limited to identify patterns. Information on anemia etiology was limited; relationships did not vary by iron-deficiency anemia.

Conclusion

Both low and high maternal Hb concentrations during pregnancy are strong predictors of adverse maternal and infant health outcomes. Additional research is needed to establish healthy reference ranges and design effective interventions to optimize maternal Hb during pregnancy.

Fetal anemia severity classification and thresholds — hemoglobin multiples of the median (MoM) define mild (MoM 0.83–0.65), moderate (MoM 0.64–0.55), and severe (MoM < 0.55) anemia; severe anemia can lead to hydrops fetalis and fetal death, and hydrops related to anemia is rare when hemoglobin is greater than 5 g/dL (corresponding to 0.47 MoM at 18 weeks and 0.36 MoM at 37 weeks); using a fetal hematocrit of less than 30% as a cutoff appears equally reliable and is often used in clinical care.

### Hyper high haemoglobin content in red blood cells and erythropoietic transitions postnatally in infants of 22 to 26 weeks' gestation: a prospective cohort study [^114SaU6n]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Globally, preterm birth affects 15 million newborns each year. Although survival rates increase with modern neonatal care, major challenges remain, particularly for the most preterm born infants. During initial care, these infants have one of the highest transfusion requirements within hospital settings, as the majority develop anaemia that could compromise oxygenation of vital organs. The aetiology of this neonatal anaemia is multi-factorial, but explanatory models often address decreasing erythropoietin levels following transition from a relatively hypoxic intrauterine environment to more oxygen-rich conditions after birth. Also well-known is a considerable blood volume loss related to frequent clinical blood samplingcausing a potential depletion of unique endogenous red blood cells (RBCs).

In contrast to the RBCs from the adult definitive erythroid lineage, originating from bone marrow and haematopoietic stem cells (HSC), the liver is the main erythropoietic organ during the gestational period ascribed to extremely preterm (EPT) birth. Until recently, it was assumed that HSC drive fetal liver erythropoiesis already from 10th to 12th gestational weeks onwards. As new lineage-tracing experiments in murine models however suggest HSC-independent pathways to be present as well as the continuing contribution of erythromyeloid progenitors (EMP) to liver erythropoiesis during fetal life, these are results that may have implications also on the general understanding of human fetal and infant erythropoiesis.

A gradual process where the HSC definitive erythroid lineage transitions to the more protected environment in the bone marrow is initiated at 16th to 18th week of gestation. During later gestational weeks, corresponding to the period of EPT birth, the actual extent of different possible erythropoietic contributions remains to be clarified.

With potentially different physiological, microenvironmental and cellular origins, the resulting peripheral RBC population may not be homogeneous, potentially having different properties between subpopulations. The mean cell haemoglobin concentration index (MCHC) after EPT birth is similar to adult values, but the RBC count expected at these gestational weeks is essentially lower. This implies that either each RBC transports more haemoglobin or that haemoglobin is unevenly distributed in heterogeneous subpopulations of red cells, such as large red cells with hyper high haemoglobin content (Hyper-He). The proportion of cells with a particularly high haemoglobin content in adults can be estimated based on the measurement of high-angle forward scatter on Sysmex XN haematology instruments (Hyper-He, > 49 pg/cell). While Hyper-He is low in healthy adult blood, < 1%, little is known about proportions in newborns.

### Evaluation of hemoglobin cutoff levels to define anemia among healthy individuals [^111jKc1a]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are the current World Health Organization (WHO) hemoglobin (Hb) cutoffs to define anemia comparable to statistical and physiological Hb cutoffs calculated using representative surveys from multiple countries collected in the last 20 years?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study of 79 950 Hb observations from population-based surveys that covered all WHO geographical regions, the WHO cutoffs for defining anemia were higher than the fifth percentile of nearly all countries except the US. This finding held for children aged 6 to 59 months and nonpregnant women aged 15 to 49 years and was confirmed using a physiological measure of increased red blood cell production.

Meaning

These findings suggest that lower Hb cutoffs based on pooled multinational data can be considered for defining anemia among children and nonpregnant women.

### International values for haemoglobin distributions in healthy pregnant women [^1146YbWH]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In short, the results presented here provide an international definition of low Hb concentrations in pregnancy, as well as a strong basis for constructing an international, pregnancy-specific, early warning score system to facilitate earlier recognition of deteriorating health in pregnant women. Our work in conjunction with other studies, that associate Hb concentrations with hypoxia-related outcomes, may provide data to create Hb concentration cut-offs for diagnosing anaemia at population level, although it will be necessary to establish which centiles reflect the different levels (mild, moderate or severe) of this important public health problem. The severity of anaemia determined by Hb concentration also needs to be determined on the basis of adverse outcomes, such as post-partum haemorrhage, the need for transfusion, or maternal or perinatal mortality.

Some thresholds recommended by WHO during pregnancy were proposed in 1958 and revised in 1968 after technical meetings with clinical and public health experts working with the evidence available at the time. Those reports relied mostly on data aggregated from four European studies with very small sample sizes (UK, n = 45; Sweden, n = 50; Finland, n = 32; Finland, n = 267). Given the limited representativeness of those data and the scientific advances since made in understanding Hb biology, the ongoing WHO project on anaemia cut-offs will provide evidence-based guidance on Hb cut-offs for individuals and populations. The results from our work could help to build the body of evidence needed to help WHO to develop guidance for individual and public health programmes and policies.

To our knowledge, this is the first population-based study to collect prospective data from across the world using the prescriptive approach recommended by WHO for the construction of international standards for human growth and development. A prescriptive approach shows how growth should occur, independent of time and place. For human growth, this is usually based on selected populations considered to be of optimal health, for example, with adequate nutritional status and at low risk of abnormal growth. In contrast, the descriptive approach is usually based on an unselected population with minimal exclusion criteria such as known risk factors for optimal health. We adopted a robust statistical methodology, as used in all the integrated studies of the INTERGROWTH-21 st Project, to pool our data and construct smoothed centiles that provide international gestational age-specific centiles for maternal Hb in healthy pregnancy.

### Haemoglobin thresholds to define anaemia from age 6 months to 65 years: estimates from international data sources [^114hvtVQ]. The Lancet: Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Haemoglobin thresholds to define anaemia usually vary between men and women, although this distinction has been challenged. Thresholds can also vary in children and during pregnancy. Haemoglobin concentrations can be lower in African, or Asian populations, but it is unclear whether this discrepancy reflects clinically significant genetic conditions affecting red cells, undefined clinical illnesses, or a different underlying baseline driven by non-clinical genetic variation.

WHO has recognised the need for further evidence for haemoglobin thresholds to define anaemia, including the influence of genetic factors (both carrier states for rare genetic conditions such as thalassaemias and haemoglobinopathies, and the role of genetics in overall variation), in order to update global guidelines. Here, we present an analysis utilising multiple large-scale datasets in ethnically diverse populations that included sufficiently detailed clinical and laboratory parameters to enable post-hoc assembly of reference populations of healthy individuals without discernible risk factors for anaemia, in which the fifth centile of haemoglobin distribution can be estimated across the lifecycle. Additionally, we summarised ancestry-specific allele frequencies and effects on haemoglobin concentrations of genetic polymorphisms and structural variants identified through existing large-scale, multi-ancestry genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We aimed to provide a rationale for a set of thresholds that can be applied globally for clinical and population use.

### A comprehensive study of umbilical cord blood cell developmental changes and reference ranges by gestation, gender and mode of delivery [^111QVjaS]. Journal of Perinatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the normal hematological values in cord blood during gestation, the impact of the type of delivery and differences in gender.

Study Design

The database included 10287 live births of 30–44 weeks gestation from cesarean or vaginal deliveries. Cord blood was collected into bags containing lyophilized heparin. Specimens were stored for 24h or less and analyzed using the SysmexXE-2100. Data from cesarean births were used to evaluate developmental hematopoietic changes.

Result

Increases during maturation occurred in hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, and decreases in mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin. The number of nucleated red blood cells per 100 white blood cells decreased but absolute counts remained constant. Quantitative counts of white blood cells, neutrophils, monocytes (MON), eosinophils and lymphocytes (LYMP) increased, but percentages of lymphocytes and monocytes decreased. Platelets increased from 30–35 weeks.

Conclusion

Reference ranges were established for cord blood. Erythroid and myeloid cells show developmental changes. Mode of delivery has a significant effect on hematologic values. Only a rare parameter showed differences based on gender. The cord blood complete blood cell count has the potential for providing relevant clinical information for managing neonatal patients.

### Haemoglobin thresholds to define anaemia in a national sample of healthy children and adolescents aged 1–19 years in India: a population-based study [^112J88Dz]. The Lancet: Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

An insufficiency in red blood cell mass to adequately deliver oxygen to peripheral tissues is defined as anaemia, from a functional perspective. An accurate case definition is crucial for both individualised clinical care and public health management. Anaemia is conventionally identified when the haemoglobin concentration in blood falls under an age-specific and sex-specific threshold or cutoff. However, the cutoffs proposed by WHO vary substantially from those proposed by other organisations such as the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), expert clinical organisations, haematology textbooks, or even individual clinical and research laboratories. However, the WHO cutoffs are used globally by most countries, especially to determine the burden of anaemia in a population.

The existing WHO cutoffs to define anaemia were first proposed in 1968, from five studies of predominantly white adult populations in North America and Europe;, at the time, data from various ages — especially for infants, young children, adolescents, and older people — were not available. In 2000, in addition to adjustments for altitude and smoking, the age group 5–14 years was split to define a lower haemoglobin cutoff for children aged 5 — 11 years, on the basis of the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2 data. No separate cutoffs were defined for infants younger than 6 months; the reference value for age 2 — 6 months was added in a later WHO document.

A 2019 review of 60 global studies, reported between 1975 and 2018, evaluated haemoglobin variation across the lifecycle. Haemoglobin cutoffs for anaemia similar to WHO recommendations were reported in several studies but tended to be lower for infants, young children, premenopausal women, and older people and higher for men. The haemoglobin cutoffs in children and adolescents from African and Asian regions were substantially lower (1–2 g/dL) in some datasets. However, limited conclusions can be made regarding the normal reference ranges because only a few studies had specifically excluded individuals with iron deficiency or inflammation. There were also uncertainties regarding the optimal testing methods to measure haemoglobin concentration. Although anaemia is defined functionally, its diagnosis is presently based on a haemoglobin cutoff that is statistically derived rather than on functional or health outcomes, which would be ideal. The present haemoglobin cutoffs for anaemia, derived 50 years ago, need reassessment to potentially enhance the evaluation of determinants, burden quantification, and the management of anaemia at the individual and population level.

### An Indian perspective for umbilical cord blood haematological parameters reference interval [^114zT7Pd]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The spread of values which is defined by an upper and a lower reference limit is termed as Reference interval (RI). They are one of the most important elements of a laboratory test result. Physicians compare their patients' test results and further interpret them on the basis of these intervals. It is hence deemed very necessary that the laboratory community devotes all the sufficient resources in order to ensure that the RI are well–established. It has been observed that most frequently, these intervals represent values for healthy, adult patients and hence, RI for other sets need to be established as in case for newborn, children or pregnant women.

The word "normal" has several different connotationions and hence can develop confusion. The terms normal values and normal ranges are obsolete and hence must not be used as a synonym for RI or reference range. To prevent such ambiguities, the terms reference ranges and intervals have been introduced and widely implemented.

RI have a major role in the interpretation of laboratory data in patient management i.e. if the laboratory data of the patient is within normal limits or not, clinical trials as well as selection of eligible participants for vaccine trials. These reference values are a subject to change by several factors including age, sex, race, geographical location as well as their dietary pattern. Various studies published globally established the age-related changes occurring in haematological parameters. Significant quantitative as well as qualitative differences in these parameters were exhibited by infants compared to older children and adults. A significant higher value of haematological parameters than those seen in older children and adults were observed in term newborns. It was thus concluded that, it is extremely unsuitable to utilise the reference ranges of adults in order to assess paediatric blood sample.

On the other hand, utilising a reference interval obtained from some other geographical location or individuals with a specific age group to a population of interest could potentially lead to inappropriate patient management and futile use of resources. Additionally, individual laboratories determining their own RI often display variations in the final reference intervals that are not supported by analytical or population differences.

### Haemoglobin thresholds to define anaemia from age 6 months to 65 years: estimates from international data sources [^117VSpoi]. The Lancet: Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Background

Detection of anaemia is crucial for clinical medicine and public health. Current WHO anaemia definitions are based on statistical thresholds (fifth centiles) set more than 50 years ago. We sought to establish evidence for the statistical haemoglobin thresholds for anaemia that can be applied globally and inform WHO and clinical guidelines.

Methods

In this analysis we identified international data sources from populations in the United States, England, Australia, China, the Netherlands, Canada, Ecuador, and Bangladesh with sufficient clinical and laboratory information collected between 1998 and 2020 to obtain a healthy reference sample. Individuals with clinical or biochemical evidence of a condition that could reduce haemoglobin concentrations were excluded. We estimated haemoglobin thresholds (ie, 5th centiles) for children aged 6–23 months, 24–59 months, 5–11 years, and 12–17 years, and adults aged 18–65 years (including during pregnancy) for individual datasets and pooled across data sources. We also collated findings from three large-scale genetic studies to summarise genetic variants affecting haemoglobin concentrations in different ancestral populations.

Findings

We identified eight data sources comprising 18 individual datasets that were eligible for inclusion in the analysis. In pooled analyses, the haemoglobin fifth centile was 104.4 g/L (90% CI 103.5–105.3) in 924 children aged 6–23 months, 110.2 g/L (109.5–110.9) in 1874 children aged 24–59 months, and 114.4 g/L (113.6–115.2) in 1839 children aged 5–11 years. Values diverged by sex in adolescents and adults. In pooled analyses, the fifth centile was 122.2 g/L (90% CI 121.3–123.1) in 1741 female adolescents aged 12–17 years and 128.2 g/L (126.4–130.0) in 1103 male adolescents aged 12–17 years. In pooled analyses of adults aged 18–65 years, the fifth centile was 119.7 g/L (90% CI 119.1–120.3) in 3640 non-pregnant females and 134.9 g/L (134.2–135.6) in 2377 males. Fifth centiles in pregnancy were 110.3 g/L (90% CI 109.5–111.0) in the first trimester (n = 772) and 105.9 g/L (104.0–107.7) in the second trimester (n = 111), with insufficient data for analysis in the third trimester. There were insufficient data for adults older than 65 years. We did not identify ancestry-specific high prevalence of non-clinically relevant genetic variants that influence haemoglobin concentrations.

Interpretation

Our results enable global harmonisation of clinical and public health haemoglobin thresholds for diagnosis of anaemia. Haemoglobin thresholds are similar between sexes until adolescence, after which males have higher thresholds than females. We did not find any evidence that thresholds should differ between people of differering ancestries.

### Evaluation of hemoglobin cutoff levels to define anemia among healthy individuals [^111Ucimy]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

On the basis of data from more than 39 000 individuals from 25 countries examined, the current WHO hemoglobin cutoff levels for defining anemia among preschool children and nonpregnant women were found to be significantly higher than the fifth percentile of Hb in apparently healthy individuals from most countries evaluated. Future studies focusing on Hb thresholds associated with functional and clinical health outcomes will improve the understanding of overall disease burden. Until then, revising Hb cutoff level definitions according to pooled multinational data could be considered.

### Haemoglobin thresholds to define anaemia from age 6 months to 65 years: estimates from international data sources [^1137fqaf]. The Lancet: Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Summary

Background

Detection of anaemia is crucial for clinical medicine and public health. Current WHO anaemia definitions are based on statistical thresholds (fifth centiles) set more than 50 years ago. We sought to establish evidence for the statistical haemoglobin thresholds for anaemia that can be applied globally and inform WHO and clinical guidelines.

Methods

In this analysis we identified international data sources from populations in the United States, England, Australia, China, the Netherlands, Canada, Ecuador, and Bangladesh with sufficient clinical and laboratory information collected between 1998 and 2020 to obtain a healthy reference sample. Individuals with clinical or biochemical evidence of a condition that could reduce haemoglobin concentrations were excluded. We estimated haemoglobin thresholds (ie, 5th centiles) for children aged 6–23 months, 24–59 months, 5–11 years, and 12–17 years, and adults aged 18–65 years (including during pregnancy) for individual datasets and pooled across data sources. We also collated findings from three large-scale genetic studies to summarise genetic variants affecting haemoglobin concentrations in different ancestral populations.

Findings

We identified eight data sources comprising 18 individual datasets that were eligible for inclusion in the analysis. In pooled analyses, the haemoglobin fifth centile was 104.4 g/L (90% CI 103.5–105.3) in 924 children aged 6–23 months, 110.2 g/L (109.5–110.9) in 1874 children aged 24–59 months, and 114.4 g/L (113.6–115.2) in 1839 children aged 5–11 years. Values diverged by sex in adolescents and adults. In pooled analyses, the fifth centile was 122.2 g/L (90% CI 121.3–123.1) in 1741 female adolescents aged 12–17 years and 128.2 g/L (126.4–130.0) in 1103 male adolescents aged 12–17 years. In pooled analyses of adults aged 18–65 years, the fifth centile was 119.7 g/L (90% CI 119.1–120.3) in 3640 non-pregnant females and 134.9 g/L (134.2–135.6) in 2377 males. Fifth centiles in pregnancy were 110.3 g/L (90% CI 109.5–111.0) in the first trimester (n = 772) and 105.9 g/L (104.0–107.7) in the second trimester (n = 111), with insufficient data for analysis in the third trimester. There were insufficient data for adults older than 65 years. We did not identify ancestry-specific high prevalence of non-clinically relevant genetic variants that influence haemoglobin concentrations.

Interpretation

Our results enable global harmonisation of clinical and public health haemoglobin thresholds for diagnosis of anaemia. Haemoglobin thresholds are similar between sexes until adolescence, after which males have higher thresholds than females. We did not find any evidence that thresholds should differ between people of differering ancestries.

### A review of cord blood concentrations of iron status parameters to define reference ranges for preterm infants [^111VrUB5]. Neonatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Iron plays an essential role in various tissue functions, and hence the reliable assessment of iron nutrition status of preterm infants appears to be mandatory.

Objectives

To summarize available data on cord blood concentrations of iron status parameters as surrogate reference ranges for preterm infants until term-equivalent age.

Methods

Review of the literature searching PubMed for cord blood values of hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor, ferritin index, transferrin saturation, reticulocyte hemoglobin content, zinc protoporphyrin/heme ratio, and hepcidin and comparison with reference ranges established for adults.

Results

Gestational age-specific cord blood concentration ranges at term were computed as weighted mean for hemoglobin [15.9 g/dl (13.3–18.4)], mean corpuscular volume [108.1 fl (97.8–118.5)] and transferrin saturation [61.2% (31.5–90.9)] and listed for ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor, ferritin index, zinc protoporphyrin/heme ratio, reticulocyte hemoglobin content and hepcidin. These surrogate reference ranges were markedly different from adult values.

Conclusion

Reference ranges of iron status parameters established for adults are probably not suitable to define iron status in preterm infants. If iron supplementation in preterm infants should be individually adjusted based on iron status parameters, it may be necessary to aim for cord blood concentration ranges to enable optimal growth and development.

### Maternal low and high hemoglobin concentrations and associations with adverse maternal and infant health outcomes: an updated global systematic review and meta-analysis [^113aFxxU]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Data management and analyses

Data were stratified by low Hb (< 110 g/L) and high Hb (≥ 130 g/L) and by timing of Hb measurement: preconception, first (≤ 13 weeks), second (14–26 weeks), and third (≥ 27 weeks) trimesters. The overall pregnancy estimates for low (< 110 g/L) and high Hb (≥ 130 g/L) included Hb concentrations measured at any time point during pregnancy (including studies with and without gestational age data). The Hb cutoffs used to define anemia varied across studies; thus, we created standard cutoffs to conduct various analyses (≤ 70, ≤ 80, ≤ 90, ≤ 100, ≤ 110, ≥ 130, ≥ 140, ≥ 150, and ≥ 160 g/L) to create summary estimates across Hb concentrations. Each category was cumulative whereby the estimates reported for the ≥ 130 g/L category include measurements for all studies using an Hb cutoff of ≥ 130, including all studies in the ≥ 140, ≥ 150, and ≥ 160 g/L categories. The reference group varied across studies and was either a cutoff (e.g. ≥ 110 g/L) or reference range (e.g. 110–119 g/L). Separate meta-analyses were conducted for iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and non-IDA for LBW, PTB, and SGA. All analyses were conducted using STATA version 14.2 (Stata Corp. 2015, College Station, TX). Values reported as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals with significance indicated at P < 0.05. Q- and I 2 values over 50% indicated heterogeneity and a Q-statistic P-value of > 0.10 indicated substantial heterogeneity. Given the significant heterogeneity, we used random effect models and the inverse-variance method for weighting for the meta-analyses.

### International values for haemoglobin distributions in healthy pregnant women [^116RxhRT]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The equations for the mean and SD from the fractional polynomial models for maternal Hb according to exact gestational age in weeks are shown below:

All log are natural logarithms; GA = exact gestational age; SD = standard deviation

These equations allow for calculations by readers of any desired centiles according to gestational age in exact weeks. Any desired centiles can be calculated as mean ± z × SD where z = −1.88, −1.645, −1.28, 0, 1.28, 1.645 and 1.88 for the 3 rd, 5 th, 10 th, 50 th, 90 th, 95 th and 97 th centiles, respectively. The actual values for these centiles according to gestational age are presented in Table 3.
1 Thresholds for individual assessment and for population prevalence where gestational age is unknown.

For unknown gestational ages, the median maternal Hb centiles are as below:

Finally, Table 4 summarises the proposed thresholds for individuals based on deviations from the normative median. For diagnostic purposes at the individual level, we propose three degrees of severity, with the lowest concentrations (which may suggest a diagnosis of anaemia) below the 3 rd centile.

### Fetal haemoglobin and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in neonates: an observational study [^1152zdmJ]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The blood of the healthy fetus contains cellular and molecular components essential for normal development. Very preterm transition from fetal to postnatal life involves an immediate disconnection from placento-maternal support, and the continued postnatal production of endogenous factors is influenced by an environment different from that in utero. Substantial differences in nutritional intake, exposure to relative hyperoxia and exogenous stressors inducing proinflammatory reactions collectively inhibit endogenous synthesis of trophic factors and have all been related to subsequent morbidity.

The depletion of endogenous factors associated with very preterm birth is considerably amplified by interventions routinely performed in neonatal intensive care. We have recently shown that blood sampling in extremely preterm infants during the first two postnatal weeks resulted in an iatrogenic blood loss of, on average, 40 mL/kg, corresponding to 58% of the circulating blood volume. This iatrogenic depletion of blood correlated with the volume of transfused adult donor blood. Of note, sample-related blood volume loss during the first postnatal week was associated with development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).

In newborn infants, fetal haemoglobin (HbF) constitutes the majority of haemoglobin (Hb). Normally, the proportion of HbF decreases very gradually as the endogenous production of adult haemoglobin proceeds, a process completed within the first 25 weeks following birth. In the very preterm infant, the proportion of HbF during the first postnatal weeks will thus serve as a sensitive quantitative marker of iatrogenic blood loss compensated by transfusions with adult donor blood leading to an exchange of HbF with adult haemoglobin (HbA). The relationship between administered blood transfusions and decreased levels of HbF was shown recently in a relatively small cohort of very preterm infants. An underlying mechanism was proposed involving a shift of the oxygen dissociation curve due to replacement of HbF by HbA, resulting in a higher fraction of oxygen dissolved in plasma and an increased exposure of tissue to oxygen.

We hypothesised that early postnatal decrease in HbF would serve as a biomarker for development of BPD in very preterm infants. This was evaluated in 452 consecutively admitted inborn infants. Levels of HbF were evaluated together with concomitant measures of arterial oxygen tension (PaO 2) and of total Hb in order to discern possible effects of decreased HbF induced by increased exposure of tissue to dissolved oxygen as well as effects mediated by anaemia.

### Maternal low and high hemoglobin concentrations and associations with adverse maternal and infant health outcomes: an updated global systematic review and meta-analysis [^112MxBFE]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

A critical component of tracking progress towards global targets is having an agreed upon definition of anemia by the global community. WHO Hb cutoffs for defining anemia are currently being re-examined. The WHO anemia cutoffs are based on limited data, in particular for pregnant women, and lack global representativeness and are widely acknowledged as outdated as they do not account for gestational age-specific changes in plasma volume expansion. Current overall anemia cutoffs are defined as < 110 g/L during pregnancy, or trimester-specific anemia cutoffs (first trimester: < 110 g/L; second trimester: < 105 g/L; third trimester: < 110 g/L). Across the literature, there is often inconsistency in the range of Hb cutoffs used to define low and high Hb thresholds, which impacts the prevalence of the problem and likelihood of detecting relationships with adverse maternal and child outcomes. Studies using multiple Hb cutoffs have reported that in some cases only lower cutoff values were associated with adverse outcomes. Few studies have evaluated the long-term health impact of maternal Hb concentrations. An exception is a recent analysis of data from the Fetal Growth Longitudinal Study of the INTERGROWTH-21st Project, a study of prospective, population-based data from Brazil, China, India, Italy, Kenya, Oman, the United Kingdom and the United States. This analysis provides maternal Hb normative centiles during pregnancy associated with positive birth outcomes as well as adequate child growth and development across the first 1000 days. The results suggest Hb cutoffs during pregnancy that are lower than currently recommended by the WHO. However, key knowledge gaps remain on the optimal thresholds of maternal Hb concentration related to both maternal and infant health, and whether those thresholds vary by anemia etiology or timing of measurement. In response to the WHO call to re-evaluate the evidence on hemoglobin thresholds to define anemia, we previously conducted a systematic review on maternal Hb concentrations and maternal and infant health outcomes including studies through October 2018. Since then, significant new research has been reported on outcomes of interest, such as maternal depression and maternal mortality, that were not included in the previous meta-analysis due to a paucity of studies.

The objective of this study was to conduct an updated systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the associations of low and high maternal Hb concentrations during pregnancy with adverse maternal and infant health outcomes. Analyses were stratified by timing of Hb assessment (preconception, first, second and third trimesters), Hb cutoff category, and etiology of anemia (iron-deficiency anemia/non-iron deficiency anemia).

### The transfusion of prematures early school age follow-up (TOP 5): protocol for a longitudinal cohort study [^115YZJHr]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Anemia of prematurity is a common diagnosis among preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and its etiology is multifactorial. Extremely low birth weight (ELBW; with birth weight 1000 g or less) infants begin life with lower hemoglobin levels than full term infants and the subsequent months in the NICU involve frequent laboratory sampling as an essential aspect of intensive care, which results in further iatrogenic lowering of the hemoglobin level. The hemoglobin threshold at which the benefits of red blood cell transfusion outweigh the risks is unknown. The developing preterm brain may be susceptible to the effects of varying hemoglobin levels. A lower hemoglobin level, and thereby a lower oxygen carrying capacity, may place the developing brain at risk of hypoxic brain injury. Conversely, a higher hemoglobin level may place the developing brain at risk of injury from iron overload. There is also the possibility of hyperviscosity, or direct injury or inflammation induced by the transfused blood product.

### Spectroscopic noninvasive measurement of hemoglobin compared with capillary and venous values in neonates [^116g2nht]. Neonatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Venepuncture-related blood loss is a common cause of neonatal anemia. Currently, this is the only way to obtain hemoglobin levels. This causes distress for the infant but can also lead to the need for blood transfusions. Recently, a new technique for measuring hemoglobin levels non-invasively has been developed to reduce iatrogenic blood loss and pain.

Objective

To compare hemoglobin levels obtained using a transcutaneous spectroscopic device (Mediscan 2000, MBR Optical Systems, Wuppertal, Germany) with venous or capillary blood samples in neonates.

Methods

Single-center prospective cohort study of term and preterm infants. The white light spectroscopic device was placed on the forearm for 60 s to measure hemoglobin content within 4 h of venous or capillary blood sampling. Pain reactions of the infants were assessed by using a neonatal pain assessment tool. Results were analyzed by Bland-Altman comparison and Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

Results

80 infants (mean gestational age 29.8 ± 3.8 weeks, mean birth weight 1,300 ± 690 g) were enrolled into the study. A total of 313 spectroscopic recordings within 2 h of a clinically indicated blood sample (181 capillary, 142 venous) were taken. The correlation coefficient R² was 0.96 for capillary/spectroscopic and 0.99 for venous/spectroscopic pairs. Pain scores were significantly less for the spectroscopic measurements (p < 0.01).

Conclusion

The results show good correlation between the hemoglobin blood levels and spectroscopic measurements. The slightly lower correlation coefficient for the capillary samples demonstrates a naturally higher variance in these values due to the laboratory method.

### Selected hematologic and biochemical measurements in African HIV-infected and uninfected pregnant women and their infants: the HIV prevention trials network 024 protocol [^1126wZYj]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

HIV-infected infants had higher ALT levels than HIV-uninfected infants at 4–6 weeks of age. Increased ALT levels in infants may suggest acute liver inflammation, though ALT values are variable in infants and may be linked to NVP exposure. Given near universal NVP prophylaxis in our cohort, we were not able to determine whether the higher ALT levels were related to HIV infection status per se, or NVP exposure. The higher ALT level in the HIV-exposed infants who were not infected, compared to HIV-uninfected and unexposed infants, may also have been due to NVP exposure, but this will require further study. The magnitude of the ALT rise was not substantial and the highest ALT in an HIV-exposed (and NVP-exposed) infant was only 63 IU/liter (Table 9).

The mean hemoglobin value for normal infants has been reported as 18.5 g/dL in a neonate ages 1–3 days in standard hematological references (Table 14), similar to our study and a study in Malawi. Perhaps the iron-containing vitamin and mineral supplements in our mothers improved infants' hemoglobin levels, as noted in a Tanzanian study. These values are 2 g/dL higher than those reported in two other African studies done in Malawi and Nigeria that suggested that the hemoglobin values at birth were lower in African than Caucasian children. The hemoglobin levels in this study were also higher than those found in a study of Italian neonates in which the mean hemoglobin level in term, appropriate-for-age neonates was only 14.4 (± 4.4) g/dL. Two studies in India and one in Turkey also reported lower hemoglobin levels than found in studying our African newborns. Newborn hemoglobin and hematocrit levels may be influenced by many factors, including the mode of delivery. For example, if a midwife holds a baby a bit lower than the level of the mother's pelvis and the not-yet-delivered placenta immediately after birth and before the cord is clamped, the baby's hemoglobin can be raised. WBC counts in infants in HPTN024 are within the normal ranges of standard references for largely Caucasian infants whose mean WBC value for normal infants at birth is 18.1/μL (Table 14).

### Association between maternal anemia and cord blood hemoglobin and ferritin concentrations in newborns: a single-center study in Turkey [^111SMrd6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of third-trimester maternal iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia on neonatal cord-blood hemoglobin (Hgb), and serum ferritin levels.

Methods

Pregnant women who gave birth between 37 0/7 and 40 6/7 weeks of gestation, and their neonates were included. Maternal hemoglobin and ferritin levels were assessed. They were divided into two groups based on Hgb values as anemic and non-anemic. Furthermore, the anemic group was classified as mild, moderate, and severe anemia. Maternal and cord Hgb, hematocrit and ferritin levels were compared between groups. The study population was stratified into two groups according to iron supplementation status.

Results

Among 627 women included, 226(36%) were diagnosed as anemic, of which 130(57.5%) had mild, 94(41.6%) moderate, and 2(0.9%) severe anemia. Mean maternal Hb levels were 9.9 ± 0.9 g/dl and 12.1 ± 0.9 g/dl in the anemic and non-anemic groups, respectively. The mean maternal serum ferritin of anemic and non-anemic mothers were 11.7 ng/ml and 15.8 ng/ml, respectively (p < 0.001). The mean cord-blood serum ferritin of neonates born from anemic and non-anemic mothers was 113 ± 68.8 ng/ml and 134 ± 95.0 ng/ml, respectively (p = 0.012). Cord-blood Hb levels of neonates born from anemic and non-anemic mothers were 15.1 ± 1.8 g/dl and 15.5 ± 2.0 g/dl, respectively (p = 0.006). The 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th percentiles of cord blood serum ferritin concentrations were 32.6, 72.2, 107.5, 154.1, and 272.6 ng/ml, respectively. Among neonates born from mild, moderate, and severe anemic mothers, there was no significant difference regarding cord-blood serum ferritin and blood count parameters (p > 0.05). Cord-blood serum ferritin concentrations were found to be 119 ± 85.7 ng/ml and 136.4 ± 87.9 ng/ml in the low and normal maternal serum ferritin groups, respectively (p = 0.015).

Conclusion

Maternal anemia is common and associated with lower neonatal cord blood hemoglobin and ferritin levels. However, lack of iron supplementation during pregnancy, rather than anemia itself, was the strongest independent predictor of neonatal anemia. These findings highlight the importance of routine antenatal iron supplementation to support fetal iron status and improve perinatal outcomes. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the effects of maternal iron supplementation on fetal iron stores and long-term outcomes.

### Evaluation of hemoglobin cutoff levels to define anemia among healthy individuals [^1122Vp8f]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Anemia, or low hemoglobin (Hb) concentration insufficient to meet an individual's physiological needs, is the most common blood condition and affects approximately one-third of the world's population. The World Health Organization (WHO) Hb cutoffs to define anemiawere first established in 1968 by experts who stated that, "over 95% of normal individuals are believed to show Hb levels higher than the cutoffs given" (ie, 11.0 g/dL for children and 12.0 g/dL for nonpregnant women [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10]). Although these cutoffs were derived from a few studies involving European, and North American, (US and Canada) men, children, and pregnant women, they have been applied uniformly among all geographical regions, with adjustments for those residing at higher altitudes or who smoke cigarettes.

Evaluation of the WHO Hb cutoffs has been a subject of active research for decades. These cutoffs were derived from statistical cutoffs not linked with physiological or health outcomes. Furthermore, the appropriateness of these cutoffs for defining anemia among certain population groups, age groups, and ethnicities has been questioned repeatedly. There is an urgent need to reexamine global thresholds to define anemia using data from diverse populations and low-income and middle-income countries to inform public health programs. Thus, our objectives were to test the appropriateness of pooling the fifth percentile Hb cutoff levels from different multinational surveys, compare survey-specific and pooled fifth percentile Hb estimates with the current WHO Hb anemia cutoffs, and examine the validity of Hb cutoffs by using a physiological indicator of erythropoiesis or red blood cell production using soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), among children aged 6 to 59 months and nonpregnant women aged 15 to 49 years. This work could have clinical and programmatic implications for anemia screening and control globally.

Estimation of LRLs in absence of the outliers

After the outliers were excluded, LRLs were estimated from cord blood samples of 375 neonates (199 males and 176 females). The histograms (Figures 6 and 7) and measures of central tendency (Table 2) suggested that the G6PD values of males, females and the combined group all exhibited normal distributions. This was confirmed by the non-statistically significant coefficients of skewness and kurtosis and by the Anderson-Darling and Shapiro-Wilk tests (Table 2). As expected, the observed gaps in presence of the outliers disappeared.

SMFM management after anemia is detected — when the fetus is at risk based on MCA Doppler, "fetal blood sampling should be offered after counseling the parents", and team-based expertise is emphasized; "Referral to a center with expertise in invasive fetal therapy is recommended". For transfusion planning in fetuses "over 24 weeks of gestation", a simple approach uses a coefficient multiplied by estimated fetal weight to target a hematocrit rise.

### Transfusion thresholds for guiding red blood cell transfusion [^1174U4w4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal haemoglobin threshold for use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in anaemic patients remains an active field of research. Blood is a scarce resource, and in some countries, transfusions are less safe than in others because of inadequate testing for viral pathogens. If a liberal transfusion policy does not improve clinical outcomes, or if it is equivalent, then adopting a more restrictive approach could be recognised as the standard of care. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review update was to compare 30-day mortality and other clinical outcomes for participants randomised to restrictive versus liberal red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds (triggers) for all clinical conditions. The restrictive transfusion threshold uses a lower haemoglobin concentration as a threshold for transfusion (most commonly, 7.0 g/dL to 8.0 g/dL), and the liberal transfusion threshold uses a higher haemoglobin concentration as a threshold for transfusion (most commonly, 9.0 g/dL to 10.0 g/dL).

Search Methods

We identified trials through updated searches: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1946 to November 2020), Embase (1974 to November 2020), Transfusion Evidence Library (1950 to November 2020), Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index (1990 to November 2020), and trial registries (November 2020). We checked the reference lists of other published reviews and relevant papers to identify additional trials. We were aware of one trial identified in earlier searching that was in the process of being published (in February 2021), and we were able to include it before this review was finalised.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials of surgical or medical participants that recruited adults or children, or both. We excluded studies that focused on neonates. Eligible trials assigned intervention groups on the basis of different transfusion schedules or thresholds or 'triggers'. These thresholds would be defined by a haemoglobin (Hb) or haematocrit (Hct) concentration below which an RBC transfusion would be administered; the haemoglobin concentration remains the most commonly applied marker of the need for RBC transfusion in clinical practice. We included trials in which investigators had allocated participants to higher thresholds or more liberal transfusion strategies compared to more restrictive ones, which might include no transfusion. As in previous versions of this review, we did not exclude unregistered trials published after 2010 (as per the policy of the Cochrane Injuries Group, 2015), however, we did conduct analyses to consider the differential impact of results of trials for which prospective registration could not be confirmed. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We identified trials for inclusion and extracted data using Cochrane methods. We pooled risk ratios of clinical outcomes across trials using a random-effects model. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We conducted predefined analyses by clinical subgroups. We defined participants randomly allocated to the lower transfusion threshold as being in the 'restrictive transfusion' group and those randomly allocated to the higher transfusion threshold as being in the 'liberal transfusion' group.

Main Results

A total of 48 trials, involving data from 21,433 participants (at baseline), across a range of clinical contexts (e.g. orthopaedic, cardiac, or vascular surgery; critical care; acute blood loss (including gastrointestinal bleeding); acute coronary syndrome; cancer; leukaemia; haematological malignancies), met the eligibility criteria. The haemoglobin concentration used to define the restrictive transfusion group in most trials (36) was between 7.0 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL. Most trials included only adults; three trials focused on children. The included studies were generally at low risk of bias for key domains including allocation concealment and incomplete outcome data. Restrictive transfusion strategies reduced the risk of receiving at least one RBC transfusion by 41% across a broad range of clinical contexts (risk ratio (RR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.66; 42 studies, 20,057 participants; high-quality evidence), with a large amount of heterogeneity between trials (I² = 96%). Overall, restrictive transfusion strategies did not increase or decrease the risk of 30-day mortality compared with liberal transfusion strategies (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.15; 31 studies, 16,729 participants; I² = 30%; moderate-quality evidence) or any of the other outcomes assessed (i.e. cardiac events (low-quality evidence), myocardial infarction, stroke, thromboembolism (all high-quality evidence)). High-quality evidence shows that the liberal transfusion threshold did not affect the risk of infection (pneumonia, wound infection, or bacteraemia). Transfusion-specific reactions are uncommon and were inconsistently reported within trials. We noted less certainty in the strength of evidence to support the safety of restrictive transfusion thresholds for the following predefined clinical subgroups: myocardial infarction, vascular surgery, haematological malignancies, and chronic bone-marrow disorders.

Authors' Conclusions

Transfusion at a restrictive haemoglobin concentration decreased the proportion of people exposed to RBC transfusion by 41% across a broad range of clinical contexts. Across all trials, no evidence suggests that a restrictive transfusion strategy impacted 30-day mortality, mortality at other time points, or morbidity (i.e. cardiac events, myocardial infarction, stroke, pneumonia, thromboembolism, infection) compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. Despite including 17 more randomised trials (and 8846 participants), data remain insufficient to inform the safety of transfusion policies in important and selected clinical contexts, such as myocardial infarction, chronic cardiovascular disease, neurological injury or traumatic brain injury, stroke, thrombocytopenia, and cancer or haematological malignancies, including chronic bone marrow failure. Further work is needed to improve our understanding of outcomes other than mortality. Most trials compared only two separate thresholds for haemoglobin concentration, which may not identify the actual optimal threshold for transfusion in a particular patient. Haemoglobin concentration may not be the most informative marker of the need for transfusion in individual patients with different degrees of physiological adaptation to anaemia. Notwithstanding these issues, overall findings provide good evidence that transfusions with allogeneic RBCs can be avoided in most patients with haemoglobin thresholds between the range of 7.0 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL. Some patient subgroups might benefit from RBCs to maintain higher haemoglobin concentrations; research efforts should focus on these clinical contexts.

### International values for haemoglobin distributions in healthy pregnant women [^113tqQKT]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The new Hb centiles allow comparisons across countries and regions using the same definitions and thresholds for potential interventions at population level, so as to harmonise efforts by WHO and other public health organisations to prevent and treat nutritional anaemias. Given the importance of evidence-informed interventions to improve maternal and child nutrition, we believe that national and international guidelines on antenatal care should take account of our findings. The fact that the centiles are gestational age-specific should also encourage policymakers to ensure that the gestational age of every pregnancy is estimated as accurately as possible, in line with the WHO 2016 guidelines.

Clearly, compared to the current recommendation, the derived haemoglobin distributions may have major policy implications because, once implemented, fewer pregnant women may be diagnosed with anaemia and the prevalence of low Hb levels will be substantially lower. This arises for two main reasons. Firstly, the current definition is derived from a statistical approach based on four very small studies, whereas the new derived haemoglobin distributions are compatible with the levels of functional health outcomes observed in the healthy populations we studied; secondly, we are presenting Hb trajectories according to gestational age rather than a single fixed cut-off across the whole of pregnancy (Fig. 4), which is an implausible biological concept. However, lowering the threshold for defining anaemia towards the end of pregnancy at individual level might have implications for management; for instance, recognising lower thresholds may allow more targeted treatment for anemia, and may alter management in those women who then have a post-partum haemorrhage.

Finally, considering the indisputable need for pregnancy-specific early warning scores that incorporate maternal Hb changes our findings could be used to facilitate earlier recognition and treatment of the unwell pregnant woman and thereby reduce both maternal morbidity and mortality rates worldwide.

Future research that focuses on obtaining accurate data on plasma volume expansion (using non-invasive methods) during healthy pregnancies would be ideal as this parameter has an impact on many biomarkers in pregnancy. Based on these derived gestation-specific centiles, a study that evaluates the statistically derived cut-offs including upper limit cut-offs and the perinatal risk-associated cut-off levels using large datasets with sufficient severe morbidity and mortality events would help to establish and validate the derived thresholds and would add support to more evidence-based protocols for the care of pregnant women.

### Changes in maternal hemoglobin during pregnancy and birth outcomes [^113fQYFD]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The relationship between maternal hemoglobin (Hb) levels during pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes has been a source of controversy. Several studies have reported that severe anemia during "early" pregnancy is associated with adverse birth outcomes, such as low birth weight (LBW), although other studies have showed no such association. It has also been reported that Hb levels at "mid- or late" pregnancy are inversely associated with birth weight and placental weight. This suggests that the association between Hb levels during pregnancy and birth outcomes may differ based on the stage of pregnancy assessed.

Physiologically, plasma volume increases by 10 to 15 percent at 6 to 12 weeks of gestation and increases rapidly thereafter until 30 to 34 weeks. This induces a modest decrease in Hb levels during pregnancy. Even in healthy pregnant women, the lack of an increase in plasma volume during pregnancy is associated with lower birth weight and placental weight, and an increased risk of delivering a small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infant. However, the impact of changes in Hb levels from early to mid- or late pregnancy on birth outcomes has not been investigated in detail.

We hypothesized that a reduction in Hb levels from early pregnancy to mid- or late pregnancy is a proxy for plasma volume increase during pregnancy and thus protects against adverse birth outcomes including LBW, SGA, and high placental ratio. Thus, the current study aims to investigate the impact of changes in Hb levels from early to mid- or late pregnancy on birth outcomes, including birth weight, placental weight, and placental ratio.

### Exon sequencing of the α-2-globin gene for the differential diagnosis of central cyanosis in newborns: a case report [^116B7kLn]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Hb M disease is a rare blood disorder, but needs to be considered in newborns with cyanosis or low SO 2 on pulse oximetry in the face of normal arterial blood saturation regardless of MetHb value. Early diagnosis helps to avoid unnecessary diagnostic approaches and aggressive interventions because the hemoglobin variants show a good prognosis.

### Reticulocyte haemoglobin content declines more markedly in preterm than in term infants in the first days after birth [^116wHtnE]. Neonatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Reticulocyte haemoglobin content, i.e., the reticulocyte equivalent (Ret-He), seems to be a promising parameter for the detection of iron deficiency (ID) in neonates because it can be obtained as part of a reticulocyte count, with no additional blood loss and at no extra cost. Due to the short life span of reticulocytes, Ret-He reflects current iron availability for erythropoiesis more accurately than other common erythrocyte indices.

Objective

We aimed to evaluate postnatal changes in Ret-He within the first days after birth in term and preterm infants with the hypothesis that preterm infants experience a more pronounced postnatal reduction in Ret-He when compared to term infants.

Methods

We conducted retrospective analyses of clinically indicated blood samples. Paired t test and mixed regression modelling were used.

Results

In total, 805 blood samples obtained from 207 term and 295 preterm infants were analysed. Ret-He decreased by 1.5 pg per day (regression coefficient [95% CI] -1.5 [-1.8 to -1.2] pg, p < 0.0001). This drop was more significant in preterm infants (regression coefficient -2.2 [-2.6 to -1.8] pg, p < 0.0001) than in term infants (regression coefficient -0.8 [-1.3 to -0.2] pg, p < 0.01, pinteraction < 0.0001).

Conclusion

Ret-He declined within the first days after birth. The observed changes with postnatal age were more pronounced in preterm than in term infants. Further studies are needed to evaluate if these changes are due to developing ID or other causes.

### Hyper high haemoglobin content in red blood cells and erythropoietic transitions postnatally in infants of 22 to 26 weeks' gestation: a prospective cohort study [^112VtSZX]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Blood cell populations, including red blood cells (RBC) unique to the extremely preterm (EPT) infant, are potentially lost due to frequent clinical blood sampling during neonatal intensive care. Currently, neonatal RBC population heterogeneity is not described by measurement of total haemoglobin or haematocrit. We therefore aimed to describe a subpopulation of large RBCs with hyper high haemoglobin content, > 49 pg (Hyper-He) following EPT birth.

Design

Prospective observational cohort study.

Setting

Two Swedish study centres.

Participants

Infants (n = 62) born between gestational weeks 22 +0 to 26 +6.

Methods

Prospective data (n = 280) were collected from March 2020 to September 2022 as part of an ongoing randomised controlled trial. Blood was sampled from the umbilical cord, at postnatal day 1–14, 1 month, 40 weeks' postmenstrual age and at 3 months' corrected age.

Results

At birth, there was a considerable inter-individual variation; Hyper-He ranging from 1.5% to 24.9% (median 7.0%). An inverse association with birth weight and gestational age was observed; Spearman's rho (CI) −0.38 (−0.63 to −0.07) and −0.39 (−0.65 to −0.05), respectively. Overall, Hyper-He rapidly decreased, only 0.6%–5.0% (median 2.2%) remaining 2 weeks postnatally. Adult levels (< 1%) were reached at corresponding term age.

Conclusion

Our results point to gestational age and birth weight-dependent properties of the RBC population. Future work needs to verify results by different measurement techniques and elucidate the potential role of differing properties between endogenous and transfused RBCs in relation to neonatal morbidities during this important time frame of child development.

### Hyper high haemoglobin content in red blood cells and erythropoietic transitions postnatally in infants of 22 to 26 weeks' gestation: a prospective cohort study [^114srHs8]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We report the measurement of a subpopulation of RBCs with a particularly high content of haemoglobin (> 49 pg) in EPT infants. Early after birth, the proportion of these cells is inversely associated with birth weight as well as gestational age and varies substantially between individuals. Also, a rapid decrease postnatally is observed.

Development of anaemia after EPT birth has so far mainly been attributed to the decreasing erythropoietin levels following birth. This study adds further aspects to this model.

First, as individual variation during the first postnatal days was considerable (2%–25%), we hypothesise that infants with a high proportion of Hyper-He at birth are more at risk for severe nadirs in Hb, as this cell population mainly seems to be lost reflected by the considerable decrease during the first 14 postnatal days. Avoiding loss of large endogenous RBCs by minimising clinical blood sampling volumes might therefore be of particular importance for these infants.

Second, although the origin of these cells is currently unknown, their presence as well as prolonged raised values might suggest a general transitional delay in the establishment of definitive HSC erythropoietic lineage erythropoiesis. The Hyper-He RBCs could be a result from stress erythropoiesis, but there are also pre-clinical reports describing large enucleated RBCs of primitive origin, even after term birth. Erythroid progenitors of EMP lineage have been found to differ in responsiveness to erythropoietin stimulation compared with HSC lineage.

Our current knowledge of the neonatal red cell population in clinical care has so far mostly been limited to describing the RBC population as homogeneous, using parameters such as total Hb, Hct and mainly derived indices such as MCHC (ratio of Hb and haematocrit) and MCH (ratio of total Hb and RBC). The 2.5th to 97.5th interval of MCH estimated in our study was 32 to 47 pg during the first postnatal days. The 97.5th percentile was thereby higher than previously reported for infants of the same gestational age (33 to 41 pg). In term infants, MCH is substantially lower; 32 to 38 pgand adult MCH is only 27 to 33 pg/cell. Our results indicate that haemoglobin is accumulated in fewer larger cells with higher Hb content in infants with a high proportion of Hyper-He.

### Normal point of care glucose values after birth in the well-baby nursery [^111m63ar]. American Journal of Perinatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Normal initial blood glucose values in healthy newborns are not well defined and are subject to controversy. Despite substantive research, there is no single initial value of glucose that can be used with certainty of safety in newborns, and thus various protocols and cutoffs have been proposed.

Study Design

We sought to characterize the normal values of blood glucose levels in a large cohort of neonates admitted to the well-baby nursery in Shaare Zedek Medical Center. The blood glucose levels were measured with a point of care (POC) glucometer (Accu-Chek Performa) within 180 minutes after birth.

Results

The study population included 3,912 newborns with a mean birth weight of 3,322 ± 439g and a mean gestational age of 39.4 ± 1.3 weeks. Sampling was performed at a median age of 73 minutes (interquartile range [IQR], 55–92 minutes). Median glucose concentration was 58 (IQR, 51–67) mg/dL, and first, third, and fifth percentiles were 34, 39, and 41 mg/dL, respectively.

Conclusion

Our data describe the normal range of POC blood glucose levels in healthy neonates on admission to the nursery. Extreme low levels were rare.

### Low fraction of fetal haemoglobin is associated with retinopathy of prematurity in the very preterm infant [^112frozH]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

The association between low HbF proportion and later ROP and changes in HbF might also reflect the loss of other endogenous blood components essential for normal organ development. A main contributor to anaemia in very preterm infants is excessive blood sampling. A significant reduction in iatrogenic blood loss in very preterm infants might maintain circulating growth factors, thereby improving the outcome of these infants. The concentration of circulating haematopoietic stem cells is inversely related to GA at birth. Historically, blood transfusions have been used as therapy for apnea and bradycardia, poor feeding, poor weight gain, and pallor. Although many studies have examined these outcomes, few are methodologically sound. A recent report from a Swedish national population-based cohort showed that extremely preterm infants receive a mean of seven adult blood transfusions per infant during the neonatal period with a considerable between-centre variation (three to nine transfusions per infant). Guidelines at Swedish units use reference values of haemoglobin (g/l) at different postnatal ages as markers of need of transfusion.

Delayed cord clamping at birth is by far the most favourable intervention for preventing anaemia. As shown in a Cochrane meta-analysis, the resulting autotransfusion of fetoplacental blood, reduces the number of blood transfusions and decreases rate of intraventricular haemorrhage and necrotising enterocolitis in very preterm infants. The impressive effects of delayed cord clamping strongly supports the hypothesis that fetal blood components are essential for prevention of morbidity in the extremely preterm infant. The excessive decrease in HbF observed during the first postnatal week is to a large extent reflecting current blood sampling strategies and existing laboratory infrastructures for blood sample analysis. It was recently shown that sample-related blood loss during neonatal clinical care is linked to the number of administered blood transfusions. The study showed a median sample-related withdrawal of whole blood of 58% of total blood volume (42 mL/kg) during the first two postnatal weeks and a median transfused volume of more than 100% of total blood volume (85 mL/kg) with adult donor blood during the corresponding period.

### Exon sequencing of the α-2-globin gene for the differential diagnosis of central cyanosis in newborns: a case report [^1133vZ48]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cyanosis is usually associated with serious conditions requiring urgent treatment in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Hemoglobin M (Hb M) disease is one type of congenital methemoglobinemia characterized by cyanosis. Among these variants, α-globin chain mutations such as Hb M Boston present cyanosis from birth while other variants usually manifest later in life.

Case Presentation

We report a case of a male newborn with cyanosis apparent since birth. Surprisingly, his respiratory and hemodynamic status including normal arterial blood oxygen saturation was stable, but oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry did not increase after 100% supplemental oxygen was started. In addition to routine pulmonary and cardiologic evaluation, further evaluation for dyshemoglobin was conducted; α2-globin gene sequencing showed a single-point variant causing Hb M Boston. Methemoglobin (MetHb) level estimated by co-oximetry was normal. After a 14-day stay in the NICU, the patient remained respiratory and hemodynamically stable without supplemental oxygen except for cyanosis.

Conclusions

Hb M disease is a benign disease and does not require any treatment whereas acquired methemoglobinemia is a potentially fatal condition. Neonatologists should be aware that low oxygenation status on pulse oximetry in the face of normal arterial blood saturation values might indicate the possibility of Hb M disease in early neonatal cyanosis, irrespective of MetHb value.

### A reappraisal of neonatal blood chemistry reference ranges using the nova M electrodes [^113dMUEt]. American Journal of Perinatology (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to establish new reference ranges for whole blood electrolytes, gases, and selected chemistries in normal healthy newborn infants obtained from cord blood and at 2–4 hours of life based on modern analytic techniques. Healthy appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA), term infants were studied. Whole venous cord blood and blood drawn at 2–4 hours of life were analyzed for gases, sodium, potassium, chloride, ionized calcium, ionized magnesium, hemoglobin, and hematocrit. Concentrations for blood glucose and blood urea nitrogen were close to older published concentrations. Na(+), K(+), and Cl(-) were significantly different and had much narrower normal margins. New norms are included for blood gases, lactate, iCa, and iMg. We offer a range of values for often-measured blood chemistries in term, healthy infants, using modern laboratory methods. These values could serve as more up-to-date references compared with older values found in major textbooks of Neonatology.

3 Results

3.1 Participants

The enrolment strategy and eligibility criteria of the INTERGROWTH-21 st Project, at population and individual level, have been published previously. In brief, 13,108 pregnant women were screened at < 14 weeks' gestation. Of these, 4607 (35.1%) met the eligibility criteria, provided written informed consent and were enrolled in FGLS. The most common reasons for exclusion were maternal height < 153 cm (1022/8501; 12%), BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 (1009/8501; 12%), and age < 18 or > 35 years (915/8501; 11%) at screening. Seventy-one women (2%) were either lost to follow-up or withdrew consent during pregnancy. Thirty-six were excluded (29 had severe medical conditions, six took up smoking, and one used recreational drugs). A total of 4422 women delivered a liveborn singleton. Of these, 4321 (97.7%) had a baby without a congenital anomaly, they are the same cohort that contributed data to the production of the INTERGROWTH-21 st Fetal Growth Standards. Of the 4321 women enrolled, 3502 (81.0%) contributed at least one Hb value for analysis (Fig. 1).

3.1.1 Maternal, perinatal and childhood outcome data compatible with a cohort at low risk for morbidity and mortality

The socio-demographic characteristics of the complete FGLS cohort, and maternal and perinatal outcome data have been reported previouslyand are similar to those of women included in the present analysis (Table 1). The mean maternal age was 28.0 (SD 3.8) years; 96.9% (3394/3502) of the women were married or living with a partner, and 54.5% (1907/3502) were nulliparous. Their mean BMI at enrolment (between 9 + 0 and 13 +6 weeks' gestation) was 22.9 (SD 3.0) kg/m 2. The median gestational age at the first antenatal visit was 11.8 (SD 1.3) weeks. The preterm birth, term LBW, Caesarean section, preeclampsia and neonatal mortality rates were 3.9%, 3.0%, 24.1%, 0.7%, and 0.09%, respectively (Table 1).

### Management of anaemia in pre-term infants [^115fvMaj]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Medium credibility.

Pre-term infants have one of the highest transfusion requirements within the hospital-setting. The vast majority of blood transfusions performed in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) are for medically stable pre-term infants with anaemia of prematurity, with the aim of improving oxygen delivery to the vital organs during the crucial phase of growth and development. However, despite the frequency of transfusion in this population, the potential benefits and harms of 'top up' transfusion are not fully understood, leading to practice variation between clinicians, institutions and countries. Significant advances have been made in the prevention of anaemia of prematurity, with recent emphasis on optimising infants' circulatory volume at birth via placental transfusion and preserving infants' own blood volume through innovative minimal sampling techniques. More research is urgently needed to establish optimal transfusion thresholds for these high-risk pre-term infants, for whom benefits as well as adverse outcomes may have consequences that extend for decades throughout the recipients' life-course. In this review, we will discuss some of the consensus and controversies regarding optimal management of anaemia in pre-term infants and highlight potential areas for future research.

### Maternal low and high hemoglobin concentrations and associations with adverse maternal and infant health outcomes: an updated global systematic review and meta-analysis [^112uGHY5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our updated systemic review provides new insights into the critical role of optimal Hb concentrations during preconception and pregnancy. Unique aspects of this review are the dual focus on low and high Hb concentrations and consideration of a range of both maternal and infant health outcomes. During pregnancy, low maternal Hb was associated with increased odds of poor birth outcomes (LBW, VLBW, PTB, SGA, stillbirth, perinatal and neonatal mortality) and adverse maternal outcomes (post-partum hemorrhage, preeclampsia, prenatal depression, blood-transfusion and maternal mortality). Likewise, high maternal Hb was associated with increased odds of poor birth outcomes (VLBW, PTB, SGA, stillbirth) and adverse maternal outcomes (preeclampsia, gestational diabetes and maternal mortality). Reported associations varied by trimester of pregnancy and Hb cutoff values but not anemia etiology.

This review builds on our prior review with the addition of 53 new studies for a total 148 studies and includes new outcomes including maternal depression and maternal mortality in the meta-analyses. This review expands upon prior reviews on maternal anemia and adverse birth outcomes. Low maternal Hb during pregnancy, depending on the timing of assessment and cutoff used, was associated with up to nearly a 5-fold increased risk of poor birth outcomes. This review highlights the importance of early prevention and treatment of anemia, before many women even seek antenatal care. The strongest associations with low maternal Hb were noted during the preconception period (for LBW and SGA) and during the first trimester (for VLBW). Throughout pregnancy, low maternal Hb concentrations remained an important predictor of poor birth outcomes. One exception was that low maternal Hb during the third trimester was associated with a reduced risk of SGA. The reason for this association is unclear and could be spurious finding or related to failure of plasma volume expansion. Overall, lower Hb cutoffs were associated with greater risks of adverse outcomes in a dose-response pattern.

### Approach to the child with… [^1126VZxw]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

15 Alternatively, many cases of anemia in children are not caused by iron deficiency. Therefore, measurement of a single Hgb level may result in unnecessary treatment and retesting. 16 Measurement of RHC may help avoid this issue. In a study of infants nine to 12 months of age, an Hgb level of less than 11 g per dL was only 26 percent sensitive in detecting iron deficiency, whereas an RHC of less than 27. 5 pg was 83 percent sensitive in detecting iron deficiency. Approach to the Child with Anemia: Illustrated Case Studies ANEMIA IN A NEWBORN A full-term infant is delivered with the use of forceps; the pregnancy and delivery were otherwise uncomplicated. The initial examination is normal, but on the second hospital day, he is pale and fussy. The reticulocyte count and bilirubin level are normal, and the Hgb level is 9 g per dL.

Repeat physical examination reveals an increased head circumference. 7 The patient's history eliminates most of these causes. A normal reticulocyte count confirms that the infant's bone marrow is functional. This rules out causes of decreased RBC production, including Fanconi anemia, Diamond-Blackfan syndrome, and congenital infections. Cranial hemorrhages are often associated with birth trauma, including vacuum and forceps delivery. In particular, subgaleal bleeds can be of sufficient volume to cause shock. Physical examination findings may include mental status changes, jaundice, tachycardia or tachypnea, and increased head circumference. In newborns, an elevated bilirubin level in association with anemia suggests hemolysis. If this infant's biliru-bin level had been elevated, further testing would have included a Coombs test to evaluate for isoimmunization and a peripheral smear to evaluate for spherocytosis or other RBC membrane defects.

Testing for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency should be considered if the patient's ethnicity or family history is a risk factor. The white blood cell count is 14, 000 per mm³, and the platelet count is 368 × 10³ per mm³ (368.

### Anemia in children… [^112AqJWG]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Physiology of Hemoglobin Production Erythropoietin is the primary hormone regulator of red blood cell production. In the fetus, erythropoietin comes from the monocyte/macrophage system of the liver. Postnatally, erythropoietin is produced in the peritubular cells of the kidneys. 1 The hemoglobin molecule is a hemeprotein complex of two pairs of similar polypeptide chains. There are six types of hemoglobin in developing humans: the embryonic, Gower-I, Gower-II, Portland, fetal hemoglobin and normal adult hemoglobin. HbF is the primary hemoglobin found in the fetus. It has a higher affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin, thus increasing the efficiency of oxygen transfer to the fetus. The relative quantities of HbF rapidly decrease to trace levels by the age of six to 12 months and are ultimately replaced by the adult forms, HbA and HbA 2. The newborn's body reclaims and stores iron as the hematocrit levels decrease during the first few months of life.

Therefore, in full-term infants, iron deficiency is rarely the cause of anemia until after six months of age. In premature infants, iron deficiency can occur only after the birth weight has been doubled. X-linked causes of anemia, such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, should be considered in males. Laboratory Evaluation Anemia is defined as a decreased concentration of hemoglobin and RBC mass compared with that in age-matched controls. In screening situations, such as the one-year check-up, only a hemoglobin level is usually obtained. When anemia is encountered during this screening, the specimen should be upgraded to a complete blood cell count, because some laboratories store blood samples for up to seven days. Physicians should first look at the mean corpuscular volume, which allows placement of the anemia into one of the standard classifications of microcytic, normocytic and macrocytic.

The reticulocyte count helps distinguish a hypoproductive anemia from a destructive process. A low reticulocyte count may indicate bone marrow disorders or aplastic crisis, while a high count generally indicates a hemolytic process or active blood loss.
