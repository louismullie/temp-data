## Question

Background:\nBeta-blockers reduce mortality in patients who have heart failure reduced ejection fraction and are on background treatment with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We aimed to compare the effects of carvedilol and metoprolol on clinical outcome.\nMethods:\nIn a multicenter, double-blind, and randomized parallel group trial, we assigned 1,511 patients with chronic heart failure to treatment with carvedilol (target dose 25 mg twice daily) and 1,518 to metoprolol (metoprolol tartrate, target dose 50 mg twice daily). Patients were required to have chronic heart failure (NYHA II-IV), previous admission for a cardiovascular reason, an ejection fraction of less than 0.35, and have been treated optimally with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors unless not tolerated. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or all-cause admission. The analysis was done by intention to treat.\nFindings:\nThe mean study duration was 58 months (SD 6). The mean ejection fraction was 0.26 (0.07), and the mean age 62 years (11). The all-cause mortality was 34% (512 of 1,511) for carvedilol and 40% (600 of 1,518) for metoprolol (hazard ratio 0.83 [95% CI 0.74–0.93], p = 0.0017). The reduction of all-cause mortality was consistent across predefined subgroups. The incidence of side effects and drug withdrawals did not differ by much between the two study groups.\nTo which of the following patients are the results of this clinical trial applicable?
A. A 62-year-old male with primarily preserved ejection fraction heart failure
B. A 75-year-old female with systolic dysfunction and an EF of 45%
C. A 56-year-old male with NYHA class I systolic heart failure
D. A 68-year-old male with NYHA class II systolic heart failure and EF 30%

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which patient profile best matches the inclusion criteria and thus the applicability of the COMET trial comparing carvedilol versus metoprolol tartrate in heart failure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the trial's key inclusion criteria: NYHA class, ejection fraction, and background therapy. Then, I should verify how each answer choice aligns or diverges from those criteria. Next, I will consider whether any near-miss options could still be extrapolated from guideline-directed therapy principles. Finally, I will confirm the best-fit answer and briefly note why the others are excluded, anchoring to COMET and contemporary HF guidelines for support [^1dca1816] [^3e229f1e].

> Let me first confirm the trial population. COMET enrolled patients with chronic heart failure, NYHA functional class II–IV, LVEF ≤ 35%, and background therapy with diuretics and ACE inhibitors; the mean LVEF was about 26% and the mean age around 62 years, with follow-up averaging roughly 4.8 years, and the primary outcome favored carvedilol over immediate-release metoprolol tartrate for all-cause mortality [^1dca1816] [^6078695e].

> Now, Option A claims a 62-year-old male with primarily preserved ejection fraction heart failure. Wait, let me verify the EF threshold. Preserved EF generally means LVEF > 50%, which is above COMET's ≤ 35% inclusion cutoff, so this patient does not match the trial's EF criterion and the results are not directly applicable to HFpEF in this context [^1dca1816].

> Option B describes a 75-year-old female with systolic dysfunction and EF 45%. Hold on, I should verify the EF again. An EF of 45% falls into mildly reduced or mid-range EF, not the ≤ 35% required by COMET, so this patient would not have been eligible and the comparative mortality signal from COMET cannot be directly extrapolated to her EF stratum [^1dca1816].

> Option C is a 56-year-old male with NYHA class I systolic heart failure. I need to check the symptom class. COMET required NYHA II–IV; class I patients were excluded, so the trial's carvedilol advantage over metoprolol tartrate cannot be directly applied to class I disease despite the fact that beta-blockers are still indicated in stage B HFrEF for mortality reduction in guidelines [^1dca1816] [^947c6a5b].

> Option D is a 68-year-old male with NYHA class II systolic heart failure and EF 30%. Let me think about this carefully: NYHA II is within II–IV, EF 30% is ≤ 35%, and the age is close to the trial's mean, so this profile matches COMET's inclusion criteria and is the most appropriate patient to whom the head-to-head mortality results would directly apply [^1dca1816].

> I should double-check whether any near-miss could still be justified by guideline logic. While beta-blockers are indicated broadly in HFrEF, COMET specifically informs the choice between carvedilol and immediate-release metoprolol tartrate in symptomatic HFrEF with reduced EF; thus, the direct comparative evidence is strongest for Option D, whereas the other options fail on EF or NYHA class and would require different evidence bases for drug selection [^1dca1816] [^3e229f1e].

> Final answer: D. A 68-year-old male with NYHA class II systolic heart failure and EF 30% is the patient whose profile aligns with COMET's inclusion criteria and to whom the trial's carvedilol versus metoprolol tartrate mortality results are directly applicable [^1dca1816].

---

The COMET trial results apply to patients with **chronic heart failure, NYHA class II–IV, LVEF ≤ 35%**, and on optimal background therapy with diuretics and ACE inhibitors [^1dca1816]. Therefore, the correct answer is **D. A 68-year-old male with NYHA class II systolic heart failure and EF 30%**. Options A and B are excluded because they have preserved or mildly reduced EF, and option C is excluded because NYHA class I patients were not enrolled in COMET [^1dca1816].

---

## Inclusion criteria of the COMET trial

The COMET trial enrolled patients with the following characteristics:

- **Chronic heart failure**: NYHA functional class II–IV [^1dca1816].
- **Reduced ejection fraction**: LVEF ≤ 35% [^1dca1816].
- **Background therapy**: Optimally treated with diuretics and ACE inhibitors unless not tolerated [^1dca1816].
- **Age and comorbidities**: Mean age 62 years, with concomitant therapies including digitalis, aldosterone antagonists, and statins [^1dca1816].

---

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Option** | **Patient characteristics** | **Applicability to comet trial** |
|-|-|-|
| A | 62-year-old male with primarily preserved ejection fraction heart failure | Not applicable. COMET enrolled patients with LVEF ≤ 35%, whereas preserved ejection fraction is typically > 50% [^1dca1816]. |
| B | 75-year-old female with systolic dysfunction and EF 45% | Not applicable. EF 45% is above the ≤ 35% threshold used in COMET [^1dca1816]. |
| C | 56-year-old male with NYHA class I systolic heart failure | Not applicable. COMET excluded NYHA class I patients; the trial enrolled only NYHA class II–IV patients [^1dca1816]. |
| D | 68-year-old male with NYHA class II systolic heart failure and EF 30% | Applicable. This patient meets all inclusion criteria: NYHA class II, LVEF ≤ 35%, and presumed optimal background therapy with diuretics and ACE inhibitors [^1dca1816]. |

---

## Conclusion

The COMET trial results are directly applicable to patients with **chronic heart failure, NYHA class II–IV, LVEF ≤ 35%**, and on optimal background therapy with diuretics and ACE inhibitors [^1dca1816]. Therefore, the correct answer is **D. A 68-year-old male with NYHA class II systolic heart failure and EF 30%**.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^3e229f1e]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification — symptom-based functional status and staging linkage is described as follows: The NYHA classification is used to characterize symptoms and functional capacity of patients with symptomatic (stage C) heart failure (HF) or advanced HF (stage D), and it is a subjective assessment by a clinician that can change over time. The NYHA functional classification is an independent predictor of mortality and is widely used in clinical practice to determine the eligibility of patients for treatment strategies. Clinicians specify NYHA classification at baseline after the initial diagnosis and after treatment through the continuum of care, and although a patient with symptomatic HF (stage C) may become asymptomatic with treatment (NYHA class I), that patient will still be categorized as stage C HF; patients with stage C HF can also be classified according to the trajectory of their symptoms.

### Higher New York heart association classes and increased mortality and hospitalization in patients with heart failure and preserved left ventricular function [^9396e797]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The association between higher New York Heart Association (NYHA) class and outcomes in patients with heart failure and preserved systolic function is not well known.

Methods

We performed a retrospective follow-up study of 988 patients with heart failure with ejection fraction > 45% who participated in the DIG trial. Using Cox proportional hazard models, we estimated risks and all-cause mortality, heart failure mortality, all-cause hospitalization, and hospitalization due to worsening heart failure during a median follow-up of 38.5 months.

Results

Patients had a median age of 68 years; 41.2% were women and 13.9%, nonwhites. Overall, 23.4% of patients died, and 19.9% were hospitalized because of worsening heart failure. Proportion of patients with NYHA classes I, II, III, and IV were 19.9%, 58.0%, 20.9%, and 1.2%, respectively, and 14.7%, 21.1%, 35.9%, and 58.3%, respectively, died of all causes (P < .001 for trend). Respective rates for heart failure-related hospitalizations were 14.2%, 17.1%, 32.5%, and 33.3% (P < .001 for trend). Compared with NYHA class I patients, adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality for class II, III, and IV patients were 1.54 (95% CI 1.02–2.32, P = 0.042), 2.56 (95% CI 1.64–24.01, P < .001), and 8.46 (95% CI 3.57–20.03, P < .001), respectively. Respective adjusted HRs (95% CI) for hospitalization due to heart failure for class II, III, and IV patients were 1.16 (0.76–1.77) (P = 0.502), 2.27 (1.45–3.56) (P < .001), and 3.71 (1.25–11.02) (P = 018). New York Heart Association classes II through IV were also associated with higher risk of all-cause hospitalization.

Conclusion

Higher NYHA classes were associated with poorer outcomes in patients with heart failure and preserved systolic function.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^ff593c3f]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Heart Failure Guideline — NYHA functional classification is used to grade symptom-based functional limitation and select candidates for treatment. The NYHA functional classification can be used to grade the severity of functional limitation based on patient report of symptoms experienced with activity and is used to define candidates for certain treatments. NYHA functional classification is an ordinal, categorical variable (I-IV) that is used to document functional limitation in patients with cardiac disease, including heart failure (HF). In HF, NYHA functional class I includes patients with no limitations in physical activity resulting from their HF; class II includes patients who are comfortable at rest but have slight symptoms resulting from HF with ordinary activity; class III includes patients who are comfortable at rest but have symptoms of HF with less than ordinary activity; and class IV includes patients who are unable to carry out any physical activity without symptoms and have symptoms at rest. NYHA functional classification has been widely used in clinical practice, clinical trials, and clinical practice guidelines to determine candidacy for drug and device therapy, although limitations include its ability to be inconsistently assessed from 1 clinician to another, resulting in poor reproducibility.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Treatment of special populations — recommendations specify that groups of patients including (a) high-risk ethnic minority groups (e.g., blacks), (b) groups underrepresented in clinical trials, and (c) any groups believed to be underserved should, in the absence of specific evidence to direct otherwise, have clinical screening and therapy in a manner identical to that applied to the broader population (Level of Evidence: B). It is recommended that evidence-based therapy for HF be used in the elderly patient, with individualized consideration of the elderly patient's altered ability to metabolize or tolerate standard medications (Level of Evidence: C). For Class IIa, the addition of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine to a standard medical regimen for HF, including ACEIs and beta-blockers, is reasonable and can be effective in blacks with NYHA functional class III or IV HF. Others may benefit similarly, but this has not yet been tested (Level of Evidence: A).

Heart failure (NYHA Classes I–IV/AHA Stages B and C) — dietitian education, sodium, and clinical labs: Research reported that despite a significant decrease in sodium intake in the dietitian education group (who received two 30- to 45-minute individualized nutrition-counseling appointments with a registered dietitian, four to six weeks apart) compared to usual care, serum sodium levels were maintained within normal range before and after the trial in both groups (Grade III). In this population, there were no studies identified that reported on the effect of medical nutrition therapy by a registered dietitian nutritionist on quality measures (Grade V), and despite the intervention in dietitian education groups there were no significant differences in quality of life or body weight (Grade III).

### One-year mortality among unselected outpatients with heart failure [^07168a34]. European Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate 1-year mortality and prognostic factors in unselected outpatients with heart failure, and to compare the observed mortality with the estimates of the primary care physicians.

Methods and Results

Four hundred and eleven consecutive patients with heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-IV (mean population age 75 years, 56% males) were enrolled in 71 primary care offices throughout Switzerland. During a mean follow-up period of 1.4 years, 68 patients had died. One-year total mortality was 12.6% compared to 4.3% in the underlying Swiss population (standardized mortality ratio 3.0). Among patients with heart failure NYHA II, III and IV, mortality was 7.1%, 15.0% and 28.0%, respectively. In multivariate Cox regression, statistically significant (P < 0.05) predictors of mortality were NYHA class (NYHA III: risk ratio [RR] = 1.6; NYHA IV: RR = 2.2), recent hospital stay for heart disease (RR = 2.3), creatinine > 120 micromol.l(-1) (RR = 1.8) systolic blood pressure < 100 mmHg (RR = 2.4), heart rate > 100 min(-1) (RR = 2.7), age (per 10 years, RR = 1.6) and female gender (RR = 0.49). Among patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, 1-year mortality was 14.3%, and predictors were similar except that female gender was no longer associated with reduced mortality. Primary care physicians significantly overestimated 1-year mortality (estimated mortality 25.9% vs observed mortality 12.6%, P = 0.001).

Conclusions

Unselected outpatients with heart failure have a poor prognosis, particularly those with advanced heart failure and a recent hospital stay for heart disease. Primary care physicians are aware of the high mortality of this growing patient population.

### Sudden death in patients with coronary heart disease without severe systolic dysfunction [^2ecd365d]. JAMA Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

The majority of sudden and/or arrhythmic deaths (SAD) in patients with coronary heart disease occur in those without severe systolic dysfunction, for whom strategies for sudden death prevention are lacking.

Objective

To provide contemporary estimates of SAD vs other competing causes of death in patients with coronary heart disease without severe systolic dysfunction to search for high-risk subgroups that might be targeted in future trials of SAD prevention.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This prospective observational cohort study included 135 clinical sites in the United States and Canada. A total of 5761 participants with coronary heart disease who did not qualify for primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy based on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of more than 35% or New York Heart Association (NYHA) heart failure class (LVEF > 30%, NYHA I).

Exposures

Clinical risk factors measured at baseline including age, LVEF, and NYHA heart failure class.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcome of SAD, which is a composite of SAD and resuscitated ventricular fibrillation arrest.

Results

The mean (SD) age of the cohort was 64(11) years. During a median of 3.9 years, the cumulative incidence of SAD and non-SAD was 2.1% and 7.7%, respectively. Sudden and/or arrhythmic death was the most common mode of cardiovascular death accounting for 114 of 202 cardiac deaths (56%), although noncardiac death was the primary mode of death in this population. The 4-year cumulative incidence of SAD was lowest in those with an LVEF of more than 60% (1.0%) and highest among those with LVEF of 30% to 40% (4.9%) and class III/IV heart failure (5.1%); however, the cumulative incidence of non-SAD was similarly elevated in these latter high-risk subgroups. Patients with a moderately reduced LVEF (40%-49%) were more likely to die of SAD, whereas those with class II heart failure and advancing age were more likely to die of non-SAD. The proportion of deaths due to SAD varied widely, from 14% (18 of 131 deaths) in patients with NYHA II to 49% (37 of 76 deaths) in those younger than 60 years.

Conclusions and Relevance

In a contemporary population of patients with coronary heart disease without severe systolic dysfunction, SAD accounts for a significant proportion of overall mortality. Moderately reduced LVEF, age, and NYHA class distinguished SAD and non-SAD, whereas other markers were equally associated with both modes of death. Absolute and proportional risk of SAD varied significantly across clinical subgroups, and both will need to be maximized in future risk stratification efforts.

### IIIB or not IIIB: a previously unanswered question [^bdb0beac]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2012). Low credibility.

The term New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IIIB has been used increasingly in clinical medicine, including as an inclusion criteria for many clinical trials assessing left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). Indeed, NYHA class IIIB is incorporated in the Food and Drug Administration's approved indication for the Heartmate II. However, on review of the medical literature, we found that there is no consensus definition of NYHA class IIIB. Until the ambiguity is resolved, we suggest that this designation not be used in clinical practice or by investigators leading clinical trials assessing therapies which convey substantial risk to patients and therefore require clarity in describing the enrolled patient population. With ongoing improvements in LVADs, this therapy will increasingly be considered in patients less sick than those who require inotropic support, providing urgency to establish a consensus system of classifying such patients who nevertheless fall within the spectrum of advanced heart failure. Herein we propose a modification of the standard NYHA classification system which can be used to fill this void.

Heart failure (NYHA Classes I–IV/AHA Stages B and C) medical nutrition therapy outcomes — In comparative education vs usual care, serum sodium levels were maintained within normal range before and after the trial in both groups, and research is needed regarding the effect of medical nutrition therapy on renal function labs and clinical labs in patients with heart failure (Grade III). For quality measures, there were no studies identified that reported on the effect of medical nutrition therapy by a registered dietitian nutritionist (Grade V). For patient-reported outcomes and anthropometrics, there were no significant differences in quality of life or body weight, and research is needed regarding the effect of medical nutrition therapy on quality of life, signs and symptoms (Grade III).

### Β-blocker therapy in heart failure… [^c3bfd59a]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

bisoprolol, carvedilol, and metoprolol; 2 of these, carvedilol and metoprolol, have Food and Drug Administration indications for the treatment of heart failure. Compared with placebo treatment, β-blocker use is associated with a consistent 30% reduction in mortality and a 40% reduction in hospitalizations in patients. Seven mortality trials with more than 300 subjects evaluated the impact of the second- and third-generation β-blockers on patients with symptomatic LV systolic dysfunction. These trials included the Metoprolol in Dilated Cardiomyopathy 93, 94 study, the Metoprolol CR/XL Randomized. heart failure and an ejection fraction less than 40% were randomized to placebo or metoprolol. Metoprolol initiated at a dose of 5 mg twice daily and titrated to a high dose of 100 to 150 mg/d was associated with a 34% decrease in the combined primary end point. Although the improvement was due entirely to a. per day.

Planned follow-up was 2 years, but the study was stopped early because of a significant decrease in all-cause mortality in the metoprolol treatment arm. Treatment with metoprolol was associated with a 34% decrease in all-cause mortality, a 38% decrease in cardiovascular mortality, a 41% decrease in sudden. death, a 49% decrease in death caused by progressive heart failure, and a 35% reduction in hospitalizations caused by heart failure. Treatment of 27 patients with metoprolol for 1 year could prevent 1 death. At approximately the same time, the CIBIS-I4 sought to determine whether bisoprolol therapy was associated with an improvement. in survival and functional status in patients with moderate heart failure and already receiving diuretics and ACE inhibitors. Although patients treated with bisoprolol had marked improvements in functional class and reduced readmissions, the observed difference in mortality between groups did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.

22; relative risk, 0. 80;. The science supporting β-blockers must be translated into practice safely and rationally if the agents are to achieve their full potential.

### Trajectories in New York heart association functional class in heart failure across the ejection fraction spectrum: data from the Swedish heart failure registry [^ca1bf3e7]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification has been a widely used clinical tool to assess dyspnoea and symptom severity in patients with heart failure (HF) for almost a century. Among patients with chronic HF, around a quarter experience symptoms at modest exertion/at rest (NYHA class III–IV), and poor NYHA functional class is associated with adverse outcomes in HF. The use of NYHA class as a single‐point assessment ranges from prognostication purposes and eligibility for HF treatments in clinical practice to enrolment criteria for trials. However, HF is a progressive syndrome, and symptom severity may change dynamically over its clinical course.

Few studies have comprehensively evaluated longitudinal changes in NYHA class over time and their associated factors, and they were often affected by several limitations, e.g. small sample sizes, inclusion of only patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), or the setting of a specific intervention. Whether the trajectories of NYHA class over time (i.e. whether symptoms are stable, improving, or worsening) independently predict mortality/morbidity on top of a single‐point assessment across the ejection fraction (EF) spectrum might have implications for clinical trial design and prognostic assessment in clinical practice.

Therefore, in a large, contemporary, and nationwide HF registry enrolling patients across the EF spectrum, we aimed to comprehensively focus on longitudinal changes in NYHA class by investigating (i) their incidence, (ii) their independent predictors, and (iii) their independent associations with mortality/morbidity on top of one‐time NYHA class assessment.

### Effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on functional class in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction – a meta-analysis [^29bcfbc5]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on symptoms in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) is controversial.

Aims

To perform a meta-analysis of studies evaluating effect of ACE inhibitors on New York Heart Association (NYHA) class in patients with LVSD.

Methods

Individual data from 10389 patients in NYHA classes I-IV from four large long-term studies (2-4-year follow-up) and summary data from 2302 patients in NYHA classes II-IV from 16 short-term studies (3 months follow-up) were meta-analysed to assess changes in NYHA class.

Results

The large long-term studies showed a significant improvement in the worst NYHA classes (classes II-IV compared to class I) in the ACE inhibitor arm versus placebo, odds ratio (OR) = 0.875 (0.811–0.943) p = 0.0005. This effect was only present in studies which included patients with chronic heart failure and was particularly pronounced on deterioration to the worst NYHA class IV, OR = 0.66 (0.52–0.84) p = 0.001. There was no effect in the studies which included patients after myocardial infarction. The short-term chronic heart failure studies showed a significant improvement in NYHA class; OR for improvement of at least one NYHA class was 2.11 (1.48–2.98, 95% CI) p < 0.0001.

Conclusion

ACE inhibition significantly improves symptomatic status measured as NYHA classification in patients with chronic heart failure.

Heart failure evidence narrative and quantified findings — A total of four studies supported the recommendations, with three studies conducted in heart failure (NYHA Classes I - IV/AHA Stages B and C) and one study in advanced heart failure (NYHA Class IV/AHA Stage D); designs included one positive-quality randomized controlled trial, two positive-quality prospective cohort studies, and one neutral-quality prospective cohort study. In NYHA Classes I - IV/AHA Stages B and C, among subjects receiving 1 L fluid per day, those consuming 2800 mg sodium per day had significantly reduced BUN, creatinine and BNP levels than those consuming 1800 mg sodium per day, with serum sodium increased and maintained within normal limits versus a gradual reduction to below normal limits; further research is needed regarding renal function and clinical labs (Grade III). Another report in this group found significantly reduced readmissions rate among subjects receiving 1 L fluid per day and consuming 2800 mg sodium per day (Grade III).

### Randomized trial of cardiac resynchronization in mildly symptomatic heart failure patients and in asymptomatic patients with left ventricular dysfunction and previous heart failure symptoms [^0b1b50e5]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to determine the effects of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II heart failure (HF) and NYHA functional class I (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association stage C) patients with previous HF symptoms.

Background

Cardiac resynchronization therapy improves left ventricular (LV) structure and function and clinical outcomes in NYHA functional class III and IV HF with prolonged QRS.

Methods

Six hundred ten patients with NYHA functional class I or II heart failure with a QRS ≥ 120 ms and a LV ejection fraction ≤ 40% received a CRT device (± defibrillator) and were randomly assigned to active CRT (CRT-ON; n = 419) or control (CRT-OFF; n = 191) for 12 months. The primary end point was the HF clinical composite response, which scores patients as improved, unchanged, or worsened. The prospectively powered secondary end point was LV end-systolic volume index. Hospitalization for worsening HF was evaluated in a prospective secondary analysis of health care use.

Results

The HF clinical composite response end point, which compared only the percent worsened, indicated 16% worsened in CRT-ON compared with 21% in CRT-OFF (p = 0.10). Patients assigned to CRT-ON experienced a greater improvement in LV end-systolic volume index (-18.4 ± 29.5 ml/m2 vs. -1.3 ± 23.4 ml/m2, p < 0.0001) and other measures of LV remodeling. Time-to-first HF hospitalization was significantly delayed in CRT-ON (hazard ratio: 0.47, p = 0.03).

Conclusions

The REVERSE (REsynchronization reVErses Remodeling in Systolic left vEntricular dysfunction) trial demonstrates that CRT, in combination with optimal medical therapy (± defibrillator), reduces the risk for heart failure hospitalization and improves ventricular structure and function in NYHA functional class II and NYHA functional class I (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association stage C) patients with previous HF symptoms.

### A propensity matched study of New York heart association class and natural history end points in heart failure [^cd60e314]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

The association between higher New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class and poor outcome in heart failure (HF) is well known. However, to what extent these associations are confounded by covariates such as age, the severity of disease, and co-morbidity burden is unknown. In the Digitalis Investigation Group (DIG) trial, 2,441 of the 7,788 patients with chronic HF had NYHA class III or IV symptoms. Propensity scores for NYHA classes III and IV were calculated for each patient and were then used to match 1,863 patients in NYHA classes III and IV with 1,863 patients in NYHA classes I and II. Kaplan-Meier and matched Cox regression analyses were used to estimate associations of NYHA class III or IV with mortality and hospitalizations during a median of 37 months of follow-up. Compared with 34% (641 of 1,863) patients in NYHA classes I and II (mortality rate 1,175 in 10,000 person-years of follow-up), 42% (777 of 1,863) patients in NYHA classes III and IV (mortality rate 1,505 in 10,000 person-years) died from all causes (hazard ratio 1.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14 to 1.45, p < 0.0001). Hospitalizations due to all causes occurred in 66% (1,232 of 1,863) patients in NYHA classes I and II (hospitalization rate 3,898 in 10,000 person-years) and 71% (1,322 of 1,863) patients in NYHA classes III and IV (hospitalization rate 4,793 in 10,000 person-years) (hazard ratio 1.16, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.28, p = 0.003). The hazard ratios for patients in NYHA classes III and IV, compared with those for those in NYHA classes I and II, for other outcomes were 1.29 for cardiovascular mortality (95% CI 1.12 to 1.48, p < 0.0001), 1.49 for HF mortality (95% CI 1.20 to 1.84, p < 0.0001), 1.18 for cardiovascular hospitalization (95% CI 1.06 to 1.32, p = 0.002), and 1.17 for HF hospitalization (95% CI 1.03 to 1.34, p = 0.017). In conclusion, baseline NYHA class is a marker of hospitalization, disease progression, and mortality in a wide spectrum of ambulatory patients with chronic HF.

### Comparative reproducibility and validity of systems for assessing cardiovascular functional class: advantages of a new specific activity scale [^43bced89]. Circulation (1981). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "NYHA functional classification for heart failure" for heart failure, mitral regurgitation, hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, aortic regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, ventricular arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, pulmonary hypertension, acute pericarditis, constrictive pericarditis, myocarditis, supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, cardiac amyloidosis, sick sinus syndrome, bradycardia, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Brugada syndrome, cardiotoxicity of cancer therapy, chest pain, long QT syndrome, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, focal atrial tachycardia, orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia, antidromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia, Chagas cardiomyopathy and vasospastic angina.

The NYHA functional classification for heart failure, or New York Heart Association Functional Classification, is a scoring system used to quantify the severity of symptoms in patients with heart failure. This classification system is applicable to patients diagnosed with heart failure and is used to assess their functional capacity and limitations during physical activity.

The NYHA classification is divided into four classes: Class I (no symptoms and no limitation in ordinary physical activity), Class II (mild symptoms and slight limitation during ordinary activity), Class III (marked limitation in activity due to symptoms, even during less-than-ordinary activity), and Class IV (severe limitations, experiences symptoms even while at rest).

The clinical utility of this calculator is to guide treatment decisions, assess prognosis, and evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in patients with heart failure. It is also commonly used in clinical trials to stratify patients and measure outcomes.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for its use, but it is subjective and relies on patient self-report, so it may not be as accurate in patients with cognitive impairment or communication difficulties.

The calculator categorizes the severity of heart failure using the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification system. It does this by analyzing a patient's reported physical abilities related to cardiac disease and matches them to one of the four NYHA classes.

Here's the breakdown of each class:

- Class I involves patients who have cardiac disease but do not experience any limitations in physical activity. Regular activities do not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, or shortness of breath.

- Class II fits patients who have a slight limitation in physical activity due to cardiac disease. They feel comfortable when at rest, but ordinary physical activities might lead to fatigue, palpitation, or breathlessness.

- Class III describes patients with a marked limitation in physical activity. These individuals are comfortable when resting, but even less than ordinary activities cause fatigue, palpitations, breathlessness, or chest pain.

- Class IV covers patients who cannot engage in any physical activity without experiencing discomfort. They exhibit symptoms of heart failure even when at rest, and any physical activity worsens these symptoms.

To determine the appropriate class for a patient, the calculator compares the user's description of their physical ability with these four established patterns. Each condition is linked specifically to one of the NYHA classes, providing a clear pathway from symptom description to classification. For example, if a patient's physical condition matches the criteria for Class I, then the result is "Class I". This comparison method efficiently identifies the level of heart failure severity based on self-reported abilities and symptoms.

### Comparison of cardiac resynchronization therapy outcomes in patients with New York heart association functional class I / II versus III / IV heart failure [^caebe90e]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Several randomized trials have shown that cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) benefits New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I/II heart failure (HF) patients, but it is unknown if similar outcomes occur in the real-world.

Methods and Results

All patients receiving CRT between 2003 and 2008 with ejection fraction (EF) ≤ 35% and QRS duration ≥ 120 ms were included. Outcomes assessed were subjective clinical response, echocardiographic response, and survival free of cardiovascular (CV) hospitalization. Baseline demographics in functional class I/II (n = 155) and functional class III/IV (n = 512) were similar, except for differences in age and several comorbidities. Clinical response was similar in both groups. The functional class I/II group had a greater decrease in left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic dimension (P = 0.031), and trended toward greater improvements in LV end-systolic dimension (P = 0.056) and EF (P = 0.059). The functional class I/II group had a better 5-year survival rate (79 vs 54%; P < .0001) and survival free of CV hospitalization (45% vs 26%; P < .0001).

Conclusions

In this real-world clinical scenario, NYHA functional class I/II CRT patients improved clinical status, and LV function and size as good as or better than those in NYHA functional class III/IV patients. These observations provide further support for the use of CRT in patients with mild symptoms of HF.

### Clinical implications of the New York heart association classification [^8e0b9b13]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This analysis of 4 landmark HF trials demonstrates that the NYHA system poorly differentiates patients across the spectrum of functional impairment. In this report, we examined both the macro‐ and microimplications of the NYHA classification system across the spectrum of HF and found that it is an unreliable predictor of survival and a poor discriminator of functional impairment in HF. A heterogeneity of risk is strikingly clear in similar NYHA classifications across studies from lower risk (eg, HF‐ACTION) to higher risk (eg, GUIDE IT) and across trials including patients with HF reduced and preserved ejection fraction, implying that the prognostic value of NYHA classification is largely dependent on the baseline risk of the patient in which it is assessed. This suggestion is contrary to the general assumption that the NYHA classification is an accurate measure of mortality risk and is consistent across studies for patients of a similar class.

Whereas the heterogeneity of NYHA class across trials is a recognized consequence of differences in inclusion and exclusion criteria of the studies assessed and the heterogeneity of risk in these studies, use of NYHA symptom severity by regulatory bodies does not necessarily take this limitation into consideration. Once clinical trials are completed, therapies may be approved for specific NYHA classes and suggested based on post hoc analyses of the data. 14 For example, the CardioMEMS HF System is presently approved for NYHA class III, and a clinical trial with expected enrollment of 3600 is ongoing to extend its approval to NYHA class II patients (NCT03387813). Our findings suggest it is time to revisit the use of NYHA class to guide enrollment into trials and approval for therapy on its basis.

Other more objective and better calibrated measures of disease severity and patient‐reported symptoms such as the KCCQ, the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, and biomarkers might be better suited to guide enrollment strategies and to appraise the impact of therapeutic interventions on patient symptoms.

Although the median levels of almost all objective HF parameters differed significantly between NYHA classes II and III, there was immense overlap in values. These findings, along with the longstanding recognition that the NYHA classification system has poor reproducibility, raise the question of whether our care of HF patients might be enhanced if we elevated the clinical use of disease descriptors that are more objective and precise. 3 Furthermore, these limitations make its centrality to the HF guidelines potentially inconsistent with the goal of improving patient care.

### Advanced chronic heart failure: a position statement from the study group on advanced heart failure of the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^ea27bb08]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2007). Low credibility.

Therapy has improved the survival of heart failure (HF) patients. However, many patients progress to advanced chronic HF (ACHF). We propose a practical clinical definition and describe the characteristics of this condition. Patients that are generally recognised as ACHF often exhibit the following characteristics: 1) severe symptoms (NYHA class III to IV); 2) episodes with clinical signs of fluid retention and/or peripheral hypoperfusion; 3) objective evidence of severe cardiac dysfunction, shown by at least one of the following: left ventricular ejection fraction < 30%, pseudonormal or restrictive mitral inflow pattern at Doppler-echocardiography; high left and/or right ventricular filling pressures; elevated B-type natriuretic peptides; 4) severe impairment of functional capacity demonstrated by either inability to exercise, a 6-minute walk test distance < 300 m or a peak oxygen uptake < 12–14 ml/kg/min; 5) history of > 1 HF hospitalisation in the past 6 months; 6) presence of all the previous features despite optimal therapy. This definition identifies a group of patients with compromised quality of life, poor prognosis, and a high risk of clinical events. These patients deserve effective therapeutic options and should be potential targets for future clinical research initiatives.

For weight management in other conditions, the registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) should coordinate care with an inter-disciplinary health care team, especially for advanced heart failure patients (NYHA Class IV/AHA Stage D) awaiting transplantation and heart failure patients (NYHA Classes I–IV/AHA Stages B, C and D) who have cardiac cachexia.

### Rosuvastatin in older patients with systolic heart failure [^4168e35e]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2007). Excellent credibility.

The study CORONA was published by Kjekshus J and colleagues in 2007 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure, Dyslipidemia and Dilated cardiomyopathy. In the CORONA study, the trial question was: what is the role of rosuvastatin in older patients with systolic HF (NYHA class II, III or IV) secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy? In the CORONA study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the CORONA study, the population was: 5011 patients (1180 female, 3831 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with systolic HF (NYHA class II, III or IV) secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy. The key exclusion criteria were previous statin-induced myopathy or hypersensitivity reaction; decompensated HF or a need for inotropic therapy; myocardial infarction within the past 6 months; unstable angina or stroke within the past 3 months; PCI, CABG, or the implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator or biventricular pacemaker within the past 3 months. In the CORONA study, the interventions were: n = 2514 rosuvastatin (10 mg PO once daily) n = 2497 placebo (matching placebo once daily). In the CORONA study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke (13.8% vs. 14.6%; HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.02). In the CORONA study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in the incidence of death from any cause (11.6/100 py vs. 12.2/100 py; HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.05) No significant difference in coronary event (9.3 vs. 10; HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.04). In the CORONA study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in muscle-related adverse events or other adverse events. In the CORONA study, the conclusion was: in patients with systolic HF (NYHA class II, III or IV) secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy, rosuvastatin was not superior to placebo with respect to death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke.

### Haemodynamic-guided management of heart failure (GUIDE-HF): a randomised controlled trial [^ead13d9b]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Previous studies have suggested that haemodynamic-guided management using an implantable pulmonary artery pressure monitor reduces heart failure hospitalisations in patients with moderately symptomatic (New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class III) chronic heart failure and a hospitalisation in the past year, irrespective of ejection fraction. It is unclear if these benefits extend to patients with mild (NYHA functional class II) or severe (NYHA functional class IV) symptoms of heart failure or to patients with elevated natriuretic peptides without a recent heart failure hospitalisation. This trial was designed to evaluate whether haemodynamic-guided management using remote pulmonary artery pressure monitoring could reduce heart failure events and mortality in patients with heart failure across the spectrum of symptom severity (NYHA funational class II-IV), including those with elevated natriuretic peptides but without a recent heart failure hospitalisation.

Methods

The randomised arm of the haemodynamic-GUIDEed management of Heart Failure (GUIDE-HF) trial was a multicentre, single-blind study at 118 centres in the USA and Canada. Following successful implantation of a pulmonary artery pressure monitor, patients with all ejection fractions, NYHA functional class II-IV chronic heart failure, and either a recent heart failure hospitalisation or elevated natriuretic peptides (based on a-priori thresholds) were randomly assigned (1:1) to either haemodynamic-guided heart failure management based on pulmonary artery pressure or a usual care control group. Patients were masked to their study group assignment. Investigators were aware of treatment assignment but did not have access to pulmonary artery pressure data for control patients. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality and total heart failure events (heart failure hospitalisations and urgent heart failure hospital visits) at 12 months assessed in all randomly assigned patients. Safety was assessed in all patients. A pre-COVID-19 impact analysis for the primary and secondary outcomes was prespecified. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03387813.

Findings

Between March 15, 2018, and Dec 20, 2019, 1022 patients were enrolled, with 1000 patients implanted successfully, and follow-up was completed on Jan 8, 2021. There were 253 primary endpoint events (0·563 per patient-year) among 497 patients in the haemodynamic-guided management group (treatment group) and 289 (0·640 per patient-year) in 503 patients in the control group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·88, 95% CI 0·74–1·05; p = 0·16). A prespecified COVID-19 sensitivity analysis using a time-dependent variable to compare events before COVID-19 and during the pandemic suggested a treatment interaction (p interaction = 0·11) due to a change in the primary endpoint event rate during the pandemic phase of the trial, warranting a pre-COVID-19 impact analysis. In the pre-COVID-19 impact analysis, there were 177 primary events (0·553 per patient-year) in the intervention group and 224 events (0·682 per patient-year) in the control group (HR 0·81, 95% CI 0·66–1·00; p = 0·049). This difference in primary events almost disappeared during COVID-19, with a 21% decrease in the control group (0·536 per patient-year) relative to pre-COVID-19, virtually no change in the treatment group (0·597 per patient-year), and no difference between groups (HR 1·11, 95% CI 0·80–1·55; p = 0·53). The cumulative incidence of heart failure events was not reduced by haemodynamic-guided management (0·85, 0·70–1·03; p = 0·096) in the overall study analysis but was significantly decreased in the pre-COVID-19 impact analysis (0·76, 0·61–0·95; p = 0·014). 1014 (99%) of 1022 patients had freedom from device or system-related complications.

Interpretation

Haemodynamic-guided management of heart failure did not result in a lower composite endpoint rate of mortality and total heart failure events compared with the control group in the overall study analysis. However, a pre-COVID-19 impact analysis indicated a possible benefit of haemodynamic-guided management on the primary outcome in the pre-COVID-19 period, primarily driven by a lower heart failure hospitalisation rate compared with the control group.

### Trajectories in New York heart association functional class in heart failure across the ejection fraction spectrum: data from the Swedish heart failure registry [^de5a07e3]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

In the follow‐up model there was no significant association between NYHA class change and outcomes. NYHA class at follow‐up independently predicted risk on top of NYHA class trajectories for all‐cause mortality (adjusted HR [95% CI] vs. NYHA class I: class II, 1.27 [1.14–1.41]; class III, 1.89 [1.68–2.12]; class IV, 3.22 [2.74–3.79]), CV mortality (class II, 1.30 [1.12–1.50]; class III, 2.07 [1.78–2.41]; class IV, 3.87 [3.17–4.73]), and first HF hospitalization (class II, 1.35 [1.20–1.52]; class III, 1.97 [1.73–2.24]; class IV, 2.44 [2.02–2.96]).

In the stratified model, with low–low (i.e. having NYHA class I–II both at baseline and follow‐up) as reference, high–low (i.e. transitioning from NYHA class III–IV at baseline to I–II at follow‐up) was not associated with any outcome. Low–high and high–high were both associated with highest risk of all‐cause mortality (adjusted HR [95% CI] vs. low–low: low–high, 2.80 [2.37–3.30]; high–high, 3.10 [2.66–3.61]), CV mortality (low–high, 3.26 [2.65–4.00]; high–high, 3.67 [3.04–4.43]), and HF hospitalization (low–high, 2.62 [2.16–3.17]; high–high, 2.52 [2.11–3.02]).

### Effect of cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients with New York heart association functional class IV heart failure [^ce7a7da7]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is considered a class I indication in treatment of patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III and IV heart failure. However, only small numbers of patients in large clinical trials have been in NYHA functional class IV. Therefore, little is known about the effects of CRT in this group. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of CRT in patients with NYHA functional class IV heart failure. Of all patients referred for CRT implantation, 61 patients with symptoms according to NYHA functional class IV were included. All patients were evaluated before implantation and at 6-month follow-up for clinical changes according to the clinical composite score and changes in left ventricular (LV) volumes and function. In addition, survival was evaluated during long-term follow-up. At 6-month follow-up, 9 patients (15%) had died and 2 patients (3%) were admitted for worsening heart failure. The remaining 39 patients (64%) showed improvement according to the clinical composite score. Decreases in LV end-systolic volume (from 167 ± 88 to 147 ± 93 ml, p = 0.009) and LV end-diastolic volume (from 211 ± 100 to 199 ± 113 ml, p = 0.135) were observed, as was a significant increase in LV ejection fraction (from 22 ± 8% to 28 ± 9%, p < 0.001). During a mean follow-up of 30 ± 26 months, 36 patients (59%) died, 27 (75%) from worsening heart failure. Respective 1- and 2-year mortality rates were 25% and 38%. In conclusion, CRT decreases LV volumes and improves cardiac function in patients with NYHA functional class IV heart failure. Nevertheless, (heart failure) mortality remains high in these patients.

Objective To investigate whether carvedilol is associated with improved survival compared with metoprolol succinate.

β-Blockers represent the mainstay of treatment for heart failure, with placebo-controlled randomized trial evidence of prolonged survival with use of metoprolol succinate, carvedilol, and bisoprolol fumarate. 1–3 Among the 3 β-blockers with trial evidence of efficacy in HF, no individual drug is recommended over the other by major guidelines, 4, 5 thus implying similar efficacy. We designed this study to investigate whether carvedilol is associated with improved survival compared with metoprolol succinate, a hypothesis based on the different adrenergic receptor profiles of the 2 drugs, other mechanistic differences, and results of the COMET trial and a recent network meta-analysis. 6–8, 13 The magnitude of reduction in mortality vs placebo was similar in the key carvedilol and metoprolol succinate trials, 1, 3 but the 2 drugs have not been compared in a head-to-head trial adequately powered to investigate mortality.

However, these concerns are not supported by the analysis restricted to patients who reached the target dose, which was in line with the primary analysis. Furthermore, the issue of dose-dependent effects is not settled; although some data support this notion, 22, 23 a meta-analysis found that the magnitude of heart rate reduction was associated with reduction in mortality, whereas β-blocker dose was not. 25.

### 2017 AHA / ACC / HRS guideline for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^9721468d]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

NICM with class I or class IV heart failure (HF) and ICD considerations: Patients with NICM and class I HF symptoms were not included in SCD-HeFT or DANISH; although such patients were included in the DEFINITE trial, only 99 (21.6%) of 458 patients in the DEFINITE trial had class I HF, and therefore it is uncertain whether a primary prevention ICD in such patients improves survival. There are insufficient data from randomized controlled trials regarding the value of the ICD in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV; ambulatory class IV HF patients in COMPANION showed improved functional status and survival with a CRT defibrillator, and unless such a patient is a candidate for CRT or advanced HF therapies such as heart transplantation or an LVAD, an ICD is not expected to meaningfully prolong survival.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^947c6a5b]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Pre–heart failure (stage B) management to prevent clinical heart failure focuses on disease-modifying therapies and device prevention at specific left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) thresholds. In patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality. In patients with a recent or remote history of myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome, statins should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and adverse cardiovascular events. In patients with a recent myocardial infarction and LVEF ≤ 40% who are intolerant to ACEI, angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality. In patients with a recent or remote history of myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome and LVEF ≤ 40%, evidence-based beta blockers should be used to reduce mortality. In patients who are at least 40 days post–myocardial infarction with LVEF ≤ 30% and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I symptoms while receiving GDMT and have reasonable expectation of meaningful survival for > 1 year, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is recommended for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death to reduce total mortality. In patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, beta blockers should be used to prevent symptomatic HF. In patients with LVEF < 50%, thiazolidinediones should not be used because they increase the risk of HF, including hospitalizations. In patients with LVEF < 50%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects may be harmful.

SHIFT

The Systolic Heart Failure Treatment with the IfInhibitor Ivabradine Trial (SHIFT) was a randomized, double-blind trial comparing Corlanor and placebo in 6,558 adult patients with stable New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II to IV heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 35%, and resting heart rate ≥ 70 bpm. Patients had to have been clinically stable for at least 4 weeks on an optimized and stable clinical regimen, which included maximally tolerated doses of beta-blockers and, in most cases, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, spironolactone, and diuretics, with fluid retention and symptoms of congestion minimized. Patients had to have been hospitalized for heart failure within 12 months prior to study entry.

The underlying cause of CHF was coronary artery disease in 68% of patients. At baseline, approximately 49% of randomized patients were NYHA class II, 50% were NYHA class III, and 2% were NYHA class IV. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 29%. All patients were initiated on Corlanor 5 mg (or matching placebo) twice daily and the dose was increased to 7.5 mg twice daily or decreased to 2.5 mg twice daily to maintain the resting heart rate between 50 and 60 bpm, as tolerated. The primary endpoint was a composite of the first occurrence of either hospitalization for worsening heart failure or cardiovascular death.

### An economic evaluation of rosuvastatin treatment in systolic heart failure: evidence from the CORONA trial [^bb23fe98]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Methods

Clinical trial

The CORONA trial assessed the effects of rosuvastatin on mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic systolic heart failure. Patients were allocated in a ratio of 1:1 to 10 mg rosuvastatin or matching placebo. Patients were recruited at 378 centres in 21 countries. The trial was approved by the Ethics Committee at each of the participating hospitals, and patients provided written informed consent. An economic analysis plan was drafted in advance of the data being released. The plan was developed using a slice of treatment-blinded trial data.

Details of the trial have been reported elsewhere, but in short patients aged 60 years or older with chronic symptomatic (NYHA functional class II–IV) heart failure of ischaemic aetiology and with an ejection fraction of ≤ 0.40 (≤ 0.35 if NYHA class II) were included. Patients already on a statin (or other lipid lowering drug) or considered by their own doctor to need (or have a contraindication to) a statin were not randomized. Lipid lowering treatment could not be stopped to make a patient eligible for inclusion. Furthermore, patients who had been treated with a statin previously were not eligible for randomization until 6 months after withdrawal of the statin.

The primary trial outcome was the composite of CV mortality, non-fatal MI, or non-fatal stroke, analysed as time to the first event. The secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, any coronary event, CV mortality, and number of hospitalizations (for CV causes, unstable angina, and worsening heart failure).

### Beta-blocker therapy for chronic heart failure… [^18412e5e]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. The U. S. Food and Drug Administration has labeled only extended-release metoprolol succinate and carvedilol for the treatment of chronic heart failure. Metoprolol is beta. 1 selective, and carvedilol is nonselective. Extended-release metoprolol succinate can be started in a dosage of 25 mg per day in patients with New York Heart Association class II failure; in patients with more severe heart failure, the starting dosage should be 12. 5 mg per day. The recommended starting dosage of carvedilol is 3. 125 mg twice daily. The mortality benefits of metoprolol have been proved only for the extended-release form. The theoretic benefits of nonselective agents such as carvedilol have not translated into a mortality benefit over beta 1-selective agents in currently available trials.

A number of major trials have evaluated the mortality benefits of beta blockers in patients with chronic heart failure. While there may be individual benefits with either drug, to date, no large-scale studies have directly compared mortality with the use of extended-release metoprolol succinate versus carvedilol. The author concluded that no data support the choice of one agent over the other. editor's note: The mortality benefit of beta-blocker therapy in patients with chronic heart failure is clear. Studies continue to show less than ideal use of these medications in patients with chronic heart failure. Current expert guidelines recommend the use of beta blockers in all stable patients who have evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction, unless there is a contraindication to their use.

A European trial comparing metoprolol and carvedilol is nearing completion, but it does not compare the extended-release form of metoprolol with carvedilol. — c. c.

### ACC / AHA 2005 guideline update for the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in the adult: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to update the 2001 guidelines for the evaluation and management of heart failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society [^d6e55058]. Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure — trial populations and outcomes with beta-blockers: Beta-blockers have been evaluated in more than 20 000 patients across more than 20 published placebo-controlled trials, enrolling patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) defined as EF less than 35% to 45% who were already treated with diuretics and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), with or without digitalis. Trials generally excluded or underrepresented patients with preserved systolic function, low heart rates (less than 65 beats per min), low systolic blood pressure (less than 85 mm Hg), hospitalization, or class IV HF; one carvedilol trial enrolled clinically stable NYHA class III and IV patients free of edema and showed a mortality reduction similar to less advanced disease. Collectively, long-term beta-blocker therapy can lessen HF symptoms, improve clinical status and well-being, and reduce the risk of death and the combined risk of death or hospitalization, with benefits seen regardless of coronary artery disease or diabetes status and in women and black patients; favorable effects were also observed in patients already taking ACEIs, suggesting additive effects from combined blockade of the 2 neurohormonal systems.

### 10 issues for the clinician in tricuspid regurgitation evaluation and management: 2025 ACC expert consensus decision pathway: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^5ab7ff64]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) — population-level progression and predictors: In patients with at least moderate TR, progression occurred in 19% and regression in 38% over approximately 2 years of follow-up. Predictors of progression included older age (HR: 1.03), lower body mass index (HR: 0.95), chronic kidney disease (HR: 1.55), worse New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class (HR: 1.52), and right ventricular (RV) dilation (HR: 1.33). Additional studies identified increased left-sided filling pressures (systolic pulmonary artery [PA] pressure and left atrial [LA] enlargement), atrial fibrillation (AF), and pacemaker or defibrillator leads as predictors of TR progression. The overall prevalence of significant TR was 4.3 times greater in females than males by the 8th decade. These patient risk factors may influence the frequency of surveillance transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in patients with TR.

Clinical Effects

Statistically significant improvement was observed in exercise capacity, as measured by the 6‑minute walk, in patients receiving continuous intravenous FLOLAN plus conventional therapy for 12 weeks compared with those receiving conventional therapy alone. Improvements were apparent in some patients at the end of the first week of therapy. Increases in exercise capacity were accompanied by statistically significant improvements in dyspnea and fatigue, as measured by the Borg Dyspnea Index and Dyspnea Fatigue Index. At Week 12, NYHA functional class improved in 21 of 51 (41%) patients treated with FLOLAN compared with none of the 48 patients treated with conventional therapy alone. However, more patients in both treatment groups (28/51 [55%] with FLOLAN and 35/48 [73%] with conventional therapy alone) showed no change in functional class, and 2/51 (4%) with FLOLAN and 13/48 (27%) with conventional therapy alone worsened.

No statistical difference in survival over 12 weeks was observed in patients with PAH/SSD treated with FLOLAN as compared with those receiving conventional therapy alone. At the end of the treatment period, 4 of 56 (7%) patients receiving FLOLAN died, whereas 5 of 55 (9%) patients receiving conventional therapy alone died.

14.3 Increased Mortality in Patients with Heart Failure Caused by Severe Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction

A large trial evaluating the effect of FLOLAN on survival in NYHA Class III and IV patients with congestive heart failure due to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction was terminated after an interim analysis of 471 patients revealed a higher mortality in patients receiving FLOLAN plus conventional therapy than in those receiving conventional therapy alone. The chronic use of FLOLAN in patients with heart failure due to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction is therefore contraindicated.

Sensitivity Analyses

In adjusted analyses across key subgroups of interest, a consistent pattern of association between greater TTR and lower risk of the primary outcome was observed among male patients and female patients, among spironolactone and placebo arms and across different BMI class (BMI < 30 kg/m 2 versus BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2) (Figure 3). When stratified by age, race, New York Heart Association class, and diabetes, the association was stronger in White participants, younger participants (aged ≤ 75 years), patients with lower class of New York Heart Association, and patients without diabetes (Figure 3). Specifically, the interaction between TTR with age was statistically significant (P for interaction < 0.05). The hazards of greater TTR on primary end point were prominent in the young than in the old. In sensitivity analyses, greater TTR was associated with a decreased risk of primary end point with restriction of the study cohort to participants enrolled in North or South America (HR, 0.89 [0.80–0.99]; P = 0.026) (Table S2), to participants with hypertension (HR, 0.82 [0.74 to 0.91]; P < 0.001) (Table S3) and when using blood pressure data from week 4 to month 4 (HR, 0.82 [0.74–0.90]; P < 0.001; Table S4). Besides, time in target range over a longer time span (months, 0 to 12) also significantly associated with a reduced risk of primary end point (HR, 0.81 [0.71–0.92]; P = 0.001) (Table S5).

2 Case Series Report

We report on three patients aged 68 year old female, 72 year old male and 83 year old female who presented to our tertiary center with decompensated heart failure symptoms according to New York Heart Association class IV (NYHA class IV), NYHA class IV and NYHA class II–III respectively between March and September 2024. Patient 1 had a prior aortic valve replacement (AVR) using a 25 mm Shelhigh supra stentless valve along with wrapping of ascending aorta using Dacron tube in March 2007 for Bicuspid aortic stenosis. Patient 2 had a prior AVR in 2006 using 25 mm Shelhigh supra stentless valve for aortic stenosis and Patient 3 had prior AVR in 2005 using 23 mm Shelhigh supra stentless valve for aortic stenosis. Full detail about their past medical history and medication history can be found in Table 1.

Table 1
Baseline patient characteristics.

Patient 1 had initially presented to a local district general hospital in February 2024 with refractory heart failure requiring very high dose of intravenous diuretics (360 mg/24 h of i.v Furosemide) due to severe aortic regurgitation before her transfer to our center. Patent 2 presented to our tertiary center with heart failure symptoms due to mixed aortic valve disease also required intravenous diuretics whereas Patient 3 presented with progressive exertional breathlessness over few months due aortic regurgitation. As a result of their previous surgical histories, they were deemed at high risk for redo‐surgery by the multidisciplinary team (Heart Team) including cardiothoracic surgeons due to high Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score and European System of Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II (EuroSCORE II) (Table 2). Hence, they were worked up for ViV TAVR using computerized tomography scan (CT scan) along with 3mensio reconstruction of both annulus (Figure 1a–c) and peripheral arterial system which demonstrated that they were all feasible for transfemoral approach. We intended for minimalist approach using local anaesthesia ± mild sedation, simplified secondary arterial access via radial artery where possible, pacing on left ventricle (LV) wire and post procedural monitoring was streamlined, focusing on clinical assessment and transthoracic echocardiography.

Secondary mitral regurgitation (MR) — surgical considerations include the following: In chronic severe secondary MR from atrial annular dilation with preserved left ventricular (LV) systolic function (LVEF ≥ 50%) and severe persistent symptoms (NYHA class III or IV) despite therapy for heart failure (HF) and for associated atrial fibrillation or other comorbidities (Stage D), mitral valve surgery may be considered. In chronic severe secondary MR related to LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF < 50%) with persistent severe symptoms (NYHA class III or IV) while on optimal GDMT for HF (Stage D), mitral valve surgery may be considered. In patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic severe secondary MR related to LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF < 50%) (Stage D) who are undergoing mitral valve surgery because of severe symptoms (NYHA class III or IV) that persist despite GDMT for HF, chordal-sparing mitral valve replacement may be reasonable to choose over downsized annuloplasty repair.

### Critical appraisal of the use of cardiac resynchronization therapy beyond current guidelines [^2e6d2c9d]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an effective treatment for patients with drug-refractory, chronic heart failure. Multiple single-center and multicenter studies have shown significant reductions in left ventricular (LV) volumes and an increase in LV systolic function. More importantly, CRT reduces mortality and morbidity during long-term follow-up. Current guidelines consider CRT as a Class I indication for heart failure patients in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III to IV with depressed LV ejection fraction ≤ 35% and a wide QRS complex (≥ 120 ms). However, the benefits of this therapy could possibly be extended to selected subgroups of patients who do not fulfill these criteria. These subgroups include patients with mildly symptomatic heart failure and patients with a narrow QRS complex (< 120 ms). Results from recent multicenter controlled clinical trials including heart failure patients in NYHA functional class I to II or with a narrow QRS complex are equivocal. Although expanding CRT to patients with a narrow QRS complex seems currently not likely, the benefits of CRT in mildly symptomatic patients are more evident. Perhaps attenuation of disease progression will prove to be a successful new treatment strategy in heart failure patients in the future. In addition, multimodality cardiac imaging will allow optimizing responder rate in patients undergoing CRT according to current guidelines.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

VICTORIA was a randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, double-blind, event-driven, multi-center trial comparing VERQUVO and placebo in 5,050 adult patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class II-IV) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 45% following a worsening heart failure event. A worsening heart failure event was defined as heart failure hospitalization within 6 months before randomization or use of outpatient IV diuretics for heart failure within 3 months before randomization.

Patients were randomized to receive VERQUVO 10 mg or matching placebo. VERQUVO was initiated at 2.5 mg once daily and increased at approximately 2 week intervals to 5 mg once daily and the target dose of 10 mg once daily, as tolerated. Placebo doses were similarly adjusted. After approximately 1 year, 90% of patients in both treatment groups were treated with the 10 mg target dose.

The primary endpoint was a composite of time to first event of CV death or hospitalization for heart failure. The median follow-up for the primary endpoint was 11 months.

The population was 64% Caucasian, 22% Asian, and 5% Black. The mean age was 67 years and 76% were male. At randomization, 59% of patients were NYHA Class II, 40% were NYHA Class III, and 1% were NYHA Class IV. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was 29%. Approximately half of all patients had an EF < 30%, and 14% had an EF between 40% and 45%. The most frequently reported medical history conditions other than heart failure included hypertension (79%), coronary artery disease (58%), hyperlipidemia (57%), diabetes mellitus (47%), atrial fibrillation (45%) and myocardial infarction (42%). At randomization, the mean eGFR was 62 mL/min/1.73 m2; the majority of patients (88%) had an eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Sixty-seven percent of the patients were enrolled within 3 months of a HF-hospitalization index event; 17% were enrolled within 3 to 6 months of HF hospitalization, and 16% were enrolled within 3 months of outpatient treatment with IV diuretics for worsening HF. The median NT-proBNP level was 2800 pg/mL at randomization.

### Pulmonary perfusion and NYHA classification improve after cardiac resynchronization therapy [^ab966350]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Material and Methods

Study Design

Twenty-two patients with heart failure (73 [66–77] years, 5 women), who were candidates for receiving CRT, were prospectively included between 2013 and 2017 at Skåne University Hospital, Lund, Sweden. The patients were examined with V/P SPECT and echocardiography before, and six months after, CRT. The patients had optimal pharmacological treatment that was considered appropriate both before and after CRT. The current study is a sub-study of a larger clinical trial study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01426321, CRT clinic) where 102 patients were included. The inclusion criteria were wide QRS complex on ECG > 120 milliseconds, symptomatic heart failure (NYHA-class II-IV) despite optimal treatment with medications, EF ≤ 35% and accepted for CRT-P or CRT-D. For the V/P SPECT examination, patients older than 40 years were considered. Exclusion criteria were chronic atrial fibrillation, life expectancy below 12 months, pregnancy, myocardial infarction less than 3 months before enrollment, severe kidney failure with glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min, significant valve disease, and patients who were incapable of giving written informed consent.

The ethical review board at Lund University approved the study, and informed consent was obtained from all patients before inclusion.

CRT

The CRT was performed, after randomization, either according to clinical routine or after extended diagnostic examinations (intervention group) using echocardiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. The operator could take part of the results from these examinations and was, therefore, guided to find optimal placement of the CRT electrode. The main results and methodology of the study have been published previously.

For this sub-study, twenty-two CRT patients from the main study were included and were complemented with a V/P SPECT examination. Eight of the 22 patients had been randomized to extended diagnostic examinations before CRT in the main study, thirteen patients had been randomized to standard diagnostic evaluation and served as controls, and one patient was not randomized because of normal EF at baseline. Four patients in the control group and three patients in the intervention group were LVESV (from echocardiography) responders. The results of the primary study were negative, and therefore, the patients are treated as one group for this sub-study.

Approximately 96% of the subjects had NYHA class II or III heart failure. Concomitant treatment included diuretics (99%), ACE inhibitors (91%), digitalis (59%), aldosterone antagonists (11%), and "statin" lipid-lowering agents (21%). The mean duration of follow-up was 4.8 years. The mean dose of carvedilol was 42 mg per day.

The trial had 2 primary end points: all-cause mortality and the composite of death plus hospitalization for any reason. The results of COMET are presented in Table 5 below. All-cause mortality carried most of the statistical weight and was the primary determinant of the trial size. All-cause mortality was 34% in the subjects treated with carvedilol and was 40% in the immediate-release metoprolol group (P = 0.0017; hazard ratio = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.93). The effect on mortality was primarily due to a reduction in cardiovascular death. The difference between the 2 groups with respect to the composite end point was not significant (P = 0.122). The estimated mean survival was 8.0 years with carvedilol and 6.6 years with immediate-release metoprolol.

Mortality

Death was not a pre-specified end point in any trial, but was analyzed in all trials. Overall, in these 4 US trials, mortality was reduced, nominally significantly so in 2 trials.

The COMET Trial

In this double-blind trial, 3,029 subjects with NYHA class II-IV heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 35%) were randomized to receive either carvedilol (target dose: 25 mg twice daily) or immediate-release metoprolol tartrate (target dose: 50 mg twice daily). The mean age of the subjects was approximately 62 years, 80% were males, and the mean left ventricular ejection fraction at baseline was 26%. Approximately 96% of the subjects had NYHA class II or III heart failure. Concomitant treatment included diuretics (99%), ACE inhibitors (91%), digitalis (59%), aldosterone antagonists (11%), and "statin" lipid-lowering agents (21%).

### Infliximab (Renflexis) [^1df2ce65]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Adverse Reactions in Patients with NYHA Class III/IV Heart Failure

In a randomized, double-blind study evaluating infliximab in moderate or severe heart failure (NYHA Class III/IV; left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 35%), 150 patients were randomized to receive treatment with 3 infusions of infliximab 10 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, or placebo, at 0, 2, and 6 weeks. Higher incidences of mortality and hospitalization due to worsening heart failure were observed in patients receiving the 10 mg/kg infliximab dose. At 1 year, 8 patients in the 10 mg/kg infliximab group had died compared with 4 deaths each in the 5 mg/kg infliximab and the placebo groups. There were trends toward increased dyspnea, hypotension, angina, and dizziness in both the 10 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg infliximab treatment groups, versus placebo. Infliximab products have not been studied in patients with mild heart failure (NYHA Class I/II) [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Hepatotoxicity

Severe liver injury, including acute liver failure and autoimmune hepatitis, has been reported in patients receiving infliximab products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Reactivation of hepatitis B virus has occurred in patients receiving TNF blockers, including infliximab products, who are chronic carriers of this virus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

In clinical trials in RA, CD, UC, AS, Ps, and PsA, elevations of aminotransferases were observed (ALT more common than AST) in a greater proportion of patients receiving infliximab than in controls (Table 1), both when infliximab was given as monotherapy and when it was used in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. In general, patients who developed ALT and AST elevations were asymptomatic, and the abnormalities decreased or resolved with either continuation or discontinuation of infliximab, or modification of concomitant medications.

WARNING: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE and LACTIC ACIDOSIS

Congestive Heart Failure

Thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone, which is a component of ACTOPLUS MET, cause or exacerbate congestive heart failure in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
After initiation of ACTOPLUS MET, and after dose increases, monitor patients carefully for signs and symptoms of heart failure (e.g., excessive, rapid weight gain, dyspnea, and/or edema). If congestive heart failure develops while taking ACTOPLUS MET, consider discontinuation of ACTOPLUS MET or dosage reduction of pioglitazone in ACTOPLUS MET [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
ACTOPLUS MET is not recommended in patients with symptomatic heart failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Initiation of ACTOPLUS MET in patients with established New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Lactic Acidosis

Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (greater than 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate:pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally greater than 5 mcg/mL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment.
Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high-risk groups are provided in the Full Prescribing Information [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7), Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].
If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue ACTOPLUS MET and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Reporting of All-Cause Hospitalization

Of the 113 trials included in this analysis, 60 (53.1%), reported on all-cause hospitalization, whereas 53 (46.9%), did not. The rates of reporting all-cause hospitalization did not improve across time (OR per 10-year increase, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.51–1.19) (Figure 1). There was no association between reporting all-cause hospitalization and the covariates that were associated with the ratio of HF to all-cause hospitalizations, including the proportion of patients with NYHA class III or IV HF (OR per 10 percentage points, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.86–1.15), LVEF (OR per 10 percentage points increase, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.57–1.40), class of intervention (OR for pharmaceutical vs nonpharmaceutical, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.35–1.66), and the enrollment of patients with HFrEF only (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.26–1.36). Of the 99 trials with available preregistered protocols, 62 trials, did not prespecify all-cause hospitalization as an end point of interest. Of 37 trials that prespecified all-cause hospitalization as an end point of interest, 35 trials, reported on it.

### Trajectories in New York heart association functional class in heart failure across the ejection fraction spectrum: data from the Swedish heart failure registry [^20e892a1]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Outcome analyses

The primary outcome of the current analysis was all‐cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were CV mortality and first HF hospitalization, with censoring at competing deaths. The outcomes data have full coverage in Sweden but censoring was performed in the event of emigration. The index date for the outcome analysis was defined as the date of the follow‐up NYHA class assessment. Event rates per 100 patient‐years with 95% CI were calculated and compared across patients with stable versus improved versus worsened NYHA class by the exact Poisson test. To assess the associations between NYHA class trajectory and outcomes, survival functions were illustrated by Kaplan–Meier curves. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models included the variables labelled with an asterisk (*) in Table 1 as covariates (with values taken at the index date for the outcome analyses, i.e. the time of the follow‐up NYHA class assessment), and the time between NYHA class assessments. Separate models were performed adjusting for NYHA class at either baseline ('baseline model') or follow‐up ('follow‐up model'). In a third multivariable model ('stratified model'), NYHA class at baseline and follow‐up was dichotomized as NYHA class I–II (low) or III–IV (high), and trajectories were analysed as low–low, low–high, high–low, and high–high. Results were reported as hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI. The differences in the associations between NYHA class change trajectory and outcomes across the EF phenotypes were assessed by including an interaction term between NYHA class trajectory and EF phenotype in the models. Three sensitivity analyses were performed where we considered (1) only patients who were encountered as outpatients both at the baseline and follow‐up NYHA class assessments; (2) only patients whose time between NYHA class assessments was < 1 year; and (3) only patients with NYHA class II–III at baseline to minimize floor and ceiling effects.

All analyses were performed using the statistical software R version 4.0.4. A two‐sided p ‐value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### Baseline characteristics and treatment of patients in prospective comparison of ARNI with ACEI to determine impact on global mortality and morbidity in heart failure trial (PARADIGM-HF) [^64aa8a8f]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

In addition to the primary endpoints of CV death and hospital admission for treatment of worsening heart failure, the first secondary endpoint in PARADIGM-HF is health-related quality of life (HRQL), as assessed by the KCCQ. The HRQL in patients with heart failure is associated with many factors, including NYHA class (patients with worse functional class tend to have worse HRQL), age (younger patients on average report worse HRQL than older ones), sex (women report worse HRQL than men), and comorbidity. Differences among trials in these factors may explain why, for example, RED-HF (Reduction of Events With Darbepoetin Alfa in Heart Failure Trial, which had a high proportion of women and in which all patients had anaemia) reported the worst HRQL, and why patients in both SHIFT (high proportion of patients in NYHA class III and IV) and HF-ACTION (Heart Failure: A Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes of Exercise Training; youngest average age) had generally worse HRQL than those in other contemporary trials, including PARADIGM-HF. Patients in PARADIGM-HF had a KCCQ OSS similar to that of patients in GISSI-HF (Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto miocardico-heart failure) and MADIT-CRT (Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial With Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy), probably reflecting the larger proportion of patients in NYHA class I or II in these trials, as well as age and gender distribution.

Adverse Reactions in Patients with NYHA Class III/IV Heart Failure

In a randomized, double-blind study evaluating REMICADE in moderate or severe heart failure (NYHA Class III/IV; left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 35%), 150 patients were randomized to receive treatment with 3 infusions of REMICADE 10 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, or placebo, at 0, 2, and 6 weeks. Higher incidences of mortality and hospitalization due to worsening heart failure were observed in patients receiving the 10 mg/kg REMICADE dose.

### Systematic review: cardiac resynchronization in patients with symptomatic heart failure [^892f0c39]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Even with optimal pharmacotherapy, symptomatic heart failure is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality.

Purpose

To determine the efficacy and safety of cardiac resynchronization therapy in adults with advanced systolic heart failure.

Data Sources

The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2002, volume 4), MEDLINE (1980–2003), EMBASE (1980–2003), other electronic databases, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration reports. We contacted primary study authors and device manufacturers, and we hand searched bibliographies of relevant papers and conference proceedings.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled clinical trials for efficacy and controlled trials plus prospective cohort studies for safety.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers chose studies and extracted data independently; random-effects models were used for analyses.

Data Synthesis

Nine trials were included in the efficacy review (3216 patients). All trial participants had reduced ejection fraction and prolonged QRS duration, and 85% had New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV symptoms. Cardiac resynchronization therapy improved ejection fraction (weighted mean difference, 0.035 [95% CI, 0.015 to 0.055]), quality of life (weighted mean reduction in score on the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, 7.6 points [CI, 3.8 to 11.5 points]), and function (58% vs. 37% of patients improved by at least 1 NYHA class). Heart failure hospitalizations were reduced by 32% (relative risk [RR], 0.68 [CI, 0.41 to 1.12]), with benefits most marked in patients with NYHA class III or IV symptoms at baseline (RR, 0.65 [CI, 0.48 to 0.88]; number needed to treat for benefit [NNT(B)], 12). All-cause mortality was reduced by 21% (RR, 0.79 [CI, 0.66 to 0.96]; NNT(B), 24), driven largely by reductions in death from progressive heart failure (RR, 0.60 [CI, 0.36 to 1.01]). Eighteen studies (total of 3701 patients with cardiac resynchronization devices) were included in the safety review. Implant success rate was 90% (CI, 89% to 91%), and 0.4% of patients died during implantation (CI, 0.2% to 0.7%). Over a median 6-month follow-up, leads dislodged in 9% of patients (CI, 7% to 10%) and mechanical malfunctions occurred in 7% (CI, 5% to 8%).

Limitations

These trials enrolled only patients with heart failure with NYHA class III or IV symptoms despite medical therapy, a prolonged QRS duration, and reduced ejection fraction; in addition, experienced providers implanted the devices. Because all but one of these trials randomly assigned patients after device implantation, their results may overestimate the potential benefits of cardiac resynchronization. Finally, since few patients in these trials had bradyarrhythmias or atrial fibrillation, the role of cardiac resynchronization in such patients is uncertain.

Conclusions

In selected patients with heart failure, cardiac resynchronization therapy improves functional and hemodynamic status, reduces heart failure hospitalizations, and reduces all-cause mortality.

### DIGitoxin to improve ouTcomes in patients with advanced chronic heart failure (DIGIT-HF): baseline characteristics compared to recent randomized controlled heart failure trials [^ce51ce6f]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline

Table 1 compares the demographics and clinical characteristics of DIGIT‐HF at baseline with PARADIGM‐HF, DAPA‐HF, and EMPEROR‐Reduced. The mean age of patients recruited to DIGIT‐HF was 66 ± 11 years, which is comparable to the other trials. The DIGIT‐HF population is predominantly male, with 20% of patients being female, similar to PARADIGM‐HF, DAPA‐HF, and EMPEROR‐Reduced. The majority of patients in DIGIT‐HF were enrolled in Western Europe (Germany/Austria), with a smaller percentage enrolled in Serbia. The mean body mass index of 29 kg/m 2 was similar in DIGIT‐HF, PARADIGM‐HF, DAPA‐HF, and EMPEROR‐Reduced. In DIGIT‐HF, 30% of patients were classified to NYHA class II and 70% to NYHA classes III–IV, whereas patients in the other HF trials were mainly classified to NYHA class II and less to NYHA classes III–IV (Figure 1A). The median time since diagnosis of HF in DIGIT‐HF was 5 years, confirming the inclusion of patients with chronic HF.

### Bosentan [^40d3a220]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.2 Lack of Benefit in Congestive Heart Failure

Bosentan is not effective in the treatment of congestive heart failure with left ventricular dysfunction. In a pair of studies, 1613 subjects with NYHA Class III-IV heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction < 35%, on diuretics, ACE inhibitor, and other therapies, were randomized to placebo or bosentan (62.5 mg twice daily titrated as tolerated to 125 mg twice daily) and followed for up to 70 weeks. Use of bosentan was associated with no benefit on patient global assessment (the primary end point) or mortality. However, hospitalizations for heart failure were more common during the first 4 to 8 weeks after bosentan was initiated. In a placebo-controlled trial of patients with severe chronic heart failure, there was an increased incidence of hospitalization for CHF associated with weight gain and increased leg edema during the first 4 to 8 weeks of treatment with bosentan. Patients required intervention with a diuretic, fluid management, or hospitalization for decompensating heart failure.

### Iobenguane I-123 (Adreview) [^aa017fec]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14.2 Congestive Heart Failure

The safety and efficacy of AdreView were evaluated in two open label, multicenter trials in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 35%. The trials excluded subjects with an acute myocardial infarction within the prior thirty days, subjects with a functioning ventricular pacemaker as well as subjects who had received defibrillation to treat a previous arrhythmic event. Subjects underwent AdreView myocardial imaging (planar and SPECT) and continued standard clinical care; AdreView results were not used in a patient's clinical care. Mortality was assessed for up to two years after AdreView imaging and the results from the trials were analyzed using a pre-specified data integration plan.

AdreView images in each trial were reviewed by three independent readers who assessed the H/M ratio on 3 hour 50 minute post-injection planar scintigraphy. Readers were masked to clinical information and the majority read value was used in analyses. The prognostic performance of the H/M ratio in estimating mortality was analyzed using the pre-specified 1.6 ratio cut-point to distinguish patients with higher risk from those with lower risk; other cut-points were also analyzed.

Within the two trials, 964 patients were enrolled; 80% were men, 83% were categorized as NYHA class II and 17% as class III. The average age was 62 years (range 20–90 years of age). Most patients had ischemic heart disease (66%) and a history of smoking (74%). The patients were on a stable regimen of cardiovascular medications, including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (93%) and beta-blockers (92%). The range of AdreView H/M ratios in these subjects was 1.0–2.4 [mean 1.4 (± 0.2 standard deviation)].

Proportions of patients with varying severity of discordance between NYHA class and KCCQ-OS are depicted in eTable 5 in Supplement 1. At admission, the following characteristics were each associated with a lower likelihood of the KCCQ-OS being better than the NYHA class: female, employed, depression, COPD, stroke, and HF with preserved ejection fraction. At 1 month, being female, working, and having depression were still associated with a lower likelihood of KCCQ-OS being better than NYHA class, with the addition of being married and having anemia. Factors associated with the likelihood of NYHA class outperforming KCCQ-OS are also summarized in eTable 6 in Supplement 1.

### Reverse epidemiology in systolic and nonsystolic heart failure: cumulative prognostic benefit of classical cardiovascular risk factors [^0fe1c32b]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Observational studies indicate that classical cardiovascular risk factors as body mass index, total cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure are associated with improved rather than impaired survival in heart failure ("reverse epidemiology"). We estimated the prognostic role of these risk factors in unselected patients with heart failure.

Methods and Results

Consecutive subjects with heart failure of any cause and severity were enrolled (n = 867), and survivors were followed for a median period of 594 days (25th to 75th percentile, 435 to 840). Mean age was 70 ± 13 years, 41% were female, New York Heart Association class distribution I through IV was 15%/29%/41%/15%, and 49% had preserved left ventricular ejection function. At follow-up, 34% of the patients had died. Low levels of any risk factor (ie, body mass index, total cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure in the low tertile) indicated the highest mortality risk. After adjustment for age, sex, New York Heart Association class, and ejection fraction, ≥ 2 risk factors in the high tertile indicated a relative reduction in mortality risk of 51% (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.68; P = 0.001) compared with subjects with 3 risk factors in the low tertile. Further adjustment for cause of heart failure, relevant comorbidities, medication, and biomarkers attenuated this association only modestly (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.89; P = 0.009).

Conclusions

In patients with heart failure, mortality risk counterintuitively increased on a cumulative scale with lower levels of body mass index, total cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure, irrespective of the type and severity of heart failure. Future studies need to identify whether risk factor control as presently recommended should be advocated in all patients with heart failure.

### Association of treatment with carvedilol vs metoprolol succinate and mortality in patients with heart failure… [^af34ada4]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

The β-blockers carvedilol and metoprolol succinate both reduce mortality in patients with heart failure, but the comparative clinical effectiveness of these drugs is unknown. Objective To investigate whether carvedilol is associated with improved survival compared with metoprolol succinate. Design, Setting, and Participants. This hypothesis was tested in the Carvedilol or Metoprolol European Trial, which found a significant 17% survival benefit with use of carvedilol over metoprolol. 8 However, COMET studied a short-acting immediate-release metoprolol formulation. Second, a higher proportion of carvedilol users achieved the recommended daily target dose than did metoprolol users.

We designed this study to investigate whether carvedilol is associated with improved survival compared with metoprolol succinate, a hypothesis based on the different adrenergic receptor profiles of the 2 drugs, other mechanistic differences, and results of the COMET trial and a recent network meta-analysis. 6–8, 13 The magnitude of reduction in mortality vs placebo was similar in the key carvedilol and metoprolol succinate trials, 1, 3 but the 2 drugs have not been compared in a head-to-head trial adequately powered to investigate mortality. Given the paucity of published head-to-head data, our study expands on the available evidence of the comparative effectiveness of carvedilol and metoprolol succinate therapy in HF by contributing an adequately powered analysis of mortality in a well-characterized study cohort.

It lends support to current treatment recommendations, 4, 5 which do not explicitly support the use of one β-blocker with proven mortality benefit in HF over the other and thereby regard the effectiveness of these drugs as equivalent. The use of total population registers allowed detailed characterization of included patients, minimal loss to follow-up, and exact assessment of outcomes throughout the study period. Concerns may be raised that a higher proportion of carvedilol users achieved the target dose than did metoprolol users; assuming dose-dependent effects, this could mask a true benefit of metoprolol over carvedilol.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for ventricular arrhythmias, more specifically with respect to patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy (primary prevention of SCD), ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines recommend to do not perform ICD placement in patients with medication-refractory NYHA class IV HF ineligible for cardiac transplantation, a LV assist device, or a CRT defibrillator incorporating both pacing and defibrillation capabilities.

### Outcomes of cardiac resynchronization therapy by New York heart association class: a patient-level meta-analysis [^93b31981]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In this meta‐analysis of patient‐level data from randomized controlled trials, CRT appeared to be beneficial in improving the time to all‐cause mortality or HFH, as well as all‐cause mortality alone, in patients in NYHA class III as well as those in NYHA class IV. However, given the relatively small number of patients in NYHA class IV, these results highlight the need for further studies on patients in NYHA class IV that are reflective of contemporaneous CRT devices, implantation techniques, and medical therapy for advanced HF.

### Effects of bisoprolol treatment for chronic heart failure initiated and followed up by primary care physicians [^269fc784]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2005). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Primary care physicians prescribe beta-blockers for chronic heart failure infrequently. The aims of the study were to assess the effects of beta-blocker treatment in out-clinic patients with regard to NYHA class and frequency of adverse events. Beta-blocker treatment was initiated and followed up by primary care physicians.

Methods

Chronic heart failure patients already treated with ACE-inhibitors and diuretics were included. The 24-week follow-up consisted of a titration phase followed by a maintenance phase. The patients received the beta-blocker bisoprolol with an initial dose of 1.25 mg and a maximal dose of 10 mg.

Results

NYHA class II, III and IV had 174, 146, and one patient, respectively. Treatment duration lasted 189 ± 73 days with a maximal bisoprolol dose of 7.2 ± 3.2 mg. Sixty-one percent of the patients tolerated at least 7.5 mg bisoprolol. The NYHA class improved from 2.4 ± 0.5 at baseline to 1.8 ± 0.6 at week 24 (P < 0.001). At final assessment, 74% of the patients showed an improvement. The number of permanent treatment withdrawals was 57 (17%). Death occurred in six patients and hospitalisation in 38 patients.

Conclusions

Bisoprolol treatment in patients with chronic heart failure was effectively and safely carried out by primary care physicians.

### Digoxin [^4051a0bf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Chronic Heart Failure

Two 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies enrolled 178 (RADIANCE trial) and 88 (PROVED trial) adult patients with NYHA Class II or III heart failure previously treated with oral digoxin, a diuretic, and an ACE inhibitor (RADIANCE only) and randomized them to placebo or treatment with digoxin tablets. Both trials demonstrated better preservation of exercise capacity in patients randomized to digoxin. Continued treatment with digoxin reduced the risk of developing worsening heart failure, as evidenced by heart failure-related hospitalizations and emergency care and the need for concomitant heart failure therapy.

DIG Trial of Digoxin in Patients with Heart Failure

The Digitalis Investigation Group (DIG) main trial was a 37-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind mortality study comparing digoxin to placebo in 6800 adult patients with heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 0.45. At randomization, 67% were NYHA class I or II, 71% had heart failure of ischemic etiology, 44% had been receiving digoxin, and most were receiving a concomitant ACE inhibitor (94%) and diuretics (82%). As in the smaller trials described above, patients who had been receiving open-label digoxin were withdrawn from this treatment before randomization. Randomization to digoxin was again associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of hospitalization, whether scored as number of hospitalizations for heart failure (relative risk 75%), risk of having at least one such hospitalization during the trial (RR 72%), or number of hospitalizations for any cause (RR 94%). On the other hand, randomization to digoxin had no apparent effect on mortality (RR 99%, with confidence limits of 91 to 107%).

### Meta-analysis on drug and device therapy of New York heart association functional class IV heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^6c8b2b25]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class IV symptoms. Decades of discovery have heralded significant advancements in the pharmacologic management of HFrEF. However, patients with NYHA IV symptoms remain an under-represented population in almost every clinical trial to date, leaving clinicians with limited evidence with which to guide drug treatment decisions in this patient group with severe heart failure. Randomized controlled trials of adult patients with NYHA IV symptoms of HFrEF randomized to current guideline-recommended medical therapy were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The outcomes of interest included the rate of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and heart failure hospitalization. A total of 39 randomized controlled trials were included. A total of 6 studies examined angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, with meta-analyses of 2 demonstrating a reduced risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk (RR) 0.76, 95% confidence interval 0.59 to 0.97, p = 0.03). A total of 11 studies examined β blockers, with meta-analysis of 6 demonstrating a reduced risk of all-cause mortality (risk ratio 0.74, 95% confidence interval 0.60 to 0.92, p = 0.008). A study examined the mineralocorticoid antagonist spironolactone, reporting a reduced risk of all-cause mortality in the NYHA IV subgroup. A total of 6 studies examined device therapy, demonstrating the benefit of cardiac resynchronization therapy with or without an implantable cardiac defibrillator in reducing hospitalization in the NYHA IV subgroup. Although trial evidence exists for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, β-blockers, and mineralocorticoid antagonist therapy in the NYHA IV population, the role of angiotensin receptor blockers is unclear. Ivabradine, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors, and sodium-glucose transport protein 2 inhibitors remain underinvestigated and have not been proved to provide any benefit above standard heart failure therapy in patients with HFrEF and NYHA IV symptoms.

### A trial of the β-blocker bucindolol in patients with advanced chronic heart failure [^3db5e30c]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

Although beta-adrenergic-receptor antagonists reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with mild-to-moderate chronic heart failure, their effect on survival in patients with more advanced heart failure is unknown.

Methods

A total of 2708 patients with heart failure designated as New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III (in 92 percent of the patients) or IV (in 8 percent) and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35 percent or lower were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with either bucindolol (1354 patients) or placebo (1354 patients) and followed for the primary end point of death from any cause.

Results

The data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping the trial after the seventh interim analysis. At that time, there was no significant difference in mortality between the two groups (unadjusted P = 0.16). The results presented here are based on complete follow-up at the time of study termination (average, 2.0 years). There were a total of 449 deaths in the placebo group (33 percent) and 411 deaths in the bucindolol group (30 percent; adjusted P = 0.13). The risk of the secondary end point of death from cardiovascular causes was lower in the bucindolol group (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.99), as was the risk of heart transplantation or death (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.77 to 0.99).

Conclusions

In a demographically diverse group of patients with NYHA class III and IV heart failure, bucindolol resulted in no significant overall survival benefit.

Outcome Definition

All-cause mortality is an objective end point and is usually reported as a primary or secondary outcome, although the NMA also included 28 trials that reported mortality as an adverse event or a reason for study withdrawal (Figure 4 A). Because the quality of these 28 studies did not differ greatly from that of the other included trials, the broadest evidence base was included.

### Infliximab-axxq (Avsola) [^6a423009]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adverse Reactions in Patients with NYHA Class III/IV Heart Failure

In a randomized, double-blind study evaluating infliximab in moderate or severe heart failure (NYHA Class III/IV; left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 35%), 150 patients were randomized to receive treatment with 3 infusions of infliximab 10 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, or placebo, at 0, 2, and 6 weeks. Higher incidences of mortality and hospitalization due to worsening heart failure were observed in patients receiving the 10 mg/kg infliximab dose. At 1 year, 8 patients in the 10 mg/kg infliximab group had died compared with 4 deaths each in the 5 mg/kg infliximab and the placebo groups. There were trends toward increased dyspnea, hypotension, angina, and dizziness in both the 10 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg infliximab treatment groups, versus placebo. Infliximab products have not been studied in patients with mild heart failure (NYHA Class I/II) [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Hepatotoxicity

Severe liver injury, including acute liver failure and autoimmune hepatitis, has been reported in patients receiving infliximab products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Reactivation of hepatitis B virus has occurred in patients receiving TNF blockers, including infliximab products, who are chronic carriers of this virus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

In clinical trials in RA, CD, UC, AS, Ps, and PsA, elevations of aminotransferases were observed (ALT more common than AST) in a greater proportion of patients receiving infliximab than in controls (Table 1), both when infliximab was given as monotherapy and when it was used in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. In general, patients who developed ALT and AST elevations were asymptomatic, and the abnormalities decreased or resolved with either continuation or discontinuation of infliximab, or modification of concomitant medications.

### Cardiac-resynchronization therapy for mild-to-moderate heart failure [^97d1dd68]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Excellent credibility.

The study RAFT was published by Tang AS and colleagues in 2010 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure and Ventricular arrhythmias. In the RAFT study, the trial question was: what is the role of addition of cardiac-resynchronization therapy to an ICD in patients with LV systolic dysfunction and a wide QRS complex? In the RAFT study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the RAFT study, the population was: 1798 patients (308 female, 1490 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with NYHA (NYHA) class II or III HF, an LVEF ≤ 30%, and an intrinsic QRS duration ≥ 120 msec or a paced QRS duration ≥ 200 msec. The key exclusion criteria were life expectancy of < 1 year from noncardiac causes, intravenous inotropic agent in the last 4 days, acute coronary syndrome, tricuspid prosthetic valve, severe primary pulmonary disease. In the RAFT study, the interventions were: n = 894 ICD-CRT implantation (ICD plus cardiac-resynchronization therapy and optimal medical therapy) n = 904 ICD implantation alone (ICD and optimal medical therapy). In the RAFT study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death or hospitalization for HF (33.2% vs. 40.3%; HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.87). In the RAFT study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in death from any cause (20.8% vs. 26.1%; HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.91) Significant decrease in hospitalization for HF (19.5% vs. 26.1%; HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.83) Significant decrease in death due to cardiovascular causes (14.5% vs. 17.9%; HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.6 to 0.96). In the RAFT study, the safety outcomes were: significant differences in adverse events at 30 after device implantation (118 vs. 61 events, p < 0.001). In the RAFT study, the conclusion was: in patients with NYHA (NYHA) class II or III HF, an LVEF ≤ 30%, and an intrinsic QRS duration ≥ 120 msec or a paced QRS duration ≥ 200 msec, ICD-CRT implantation was superior to ICD implantation alone with respect to death or hospitalization for HF.

### Survival after mitral valve replacement: rationale for surgery before occurrence of severe symptoms [^f2ec737f]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Background

This study was undertaken to evaluate survival after mitral valve replacement, with a focus on the impact of age and preoperative symptoms.

Methods

Survival was analyzed in 784 patients undergoing mitral valve replacement from 1980 through 2000. Relative survival was estimated by relating the observed survival to the expected survival in a cohort, comparable regarding sex, age group, and calendar period, in the general Swedish population.

Results

Early mortality was 9.7%. Relative survival rates after 5, 10, and 15 years were 83%, 70%, and 54%, respectively. The corresponding rates for observed survival were 75%, 56%, and 36%. Advanced New York Heart Association class, but not high age, was a risk factor for early mortality, whereas both factors decreased survival. An association between age and New York Heart Association class was found, the majority of old patients also being severely symptomatic. Patients in New York Heart Association classes I and II showed excellent relative survival.

Conclusions

Survival is reduced after mitral valve replacement in patients with severe preoperative symptoms, whereas patients with less-severe symptoms show excellent survival. Older patients were more often severely symptomatic at the time of surgery. Irrespective of age, surgery before the occurrence of advanced symptoms should improve the long-term outcome.

Factors associated with the occurrence of acute kidney injury

According to our bivariate analysis, the development of AKI was associated with variables such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, previous history of AKI, older age (> 60 years), sepsis at admission, NYHA class IV disease, and receiving loop diuretics immediately before admission. Multivariate analysis revealed that participants with diabetes and hypertension were at increased risk of AKI, with adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of 9.55 (95% CI = 2.68–33.99) and 2.34 (95% CI = 1.08–5.07), respectively. Older patients aged ≥ 60 years were also at a significantly greater risk of developing AKI than were those younger than 60 years, with an AOR of 2.95 (95% CI: 1.34–6.21). Those with a previous history of AKI also had an increased risk of developing AKI, with an AOR of 11.56 (95% CI: 4.02–33.26). Participants who had been taking loop diuretics before admission were also found to be at greater risk of AKI than were those who were not taking loop diuretics, with an AOR of 4.03 (95% CI: 1.86–8.69) (Table 5).

### MADIT-CRT (multicenter automatic defibrillator implantation trial-cardiac resynchronization therapy): cardiac resynchronization therapy towards early management of heart failure [^2f388199]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

This commentary refers to 'Cardiac-resynchronization therapy for the prevention of heart-failure events' †, by A.J. Moss et al. published in the New England Journal of Medicine, 2009; 361:

Randomized clinical trials have firmly established the role of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in chronic heart failure patients in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV who have left ventricular dysfunction and a prolonged QRS complex. CRT improves symptoms, reduces the need for hospitalizations, and improves survival by reversal of left ventricular remodelling and by slowing of disease progression.

In these CRT trials, patients were selected on the basis of the degree of heart failure. COMPANIONincluded 86% class III and 14% class IV patients. CARE-HF included 94% NYHA class III and 6% class IV patients. Thus, the data on the beneficial effects of CRT, based on large trials, are restricted to class III and to a lesser degree to class IV patients. In contrast, in primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) trials, the spectrum of patients was broader. Although SCD-HeFT also selected heart failure patients in class III (30%), the majority were in class II (70%). The two post-myocardial infarction trials, MADIT and MADIT II, included an even broader spectrum of heart failure patients although primary inclusion was on the basis of ejection fraction and history of prior myocardial infarction. MADIT included 35% of patients in class I, and 65% in class II–III. In MADIT II, 37% of patients were in NYHA class I, 35% in class II, 24% in class III, and 5% in class IV.

### Digoxin (Lanoxin) [^8d1599f6]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14.1 Chronic Heart Failure

Two 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies enrolled 178 (RADIANCE trial) and 88 (PROVED trial) adult patients with NYHA Class II or III heart failure previously treated with oral digoxin, a diuretic, and an ACE inhibitor (RADIANCE only) and randomized them to placebo or treatment with LANOXIN Tablets. Both trials demonstrated better preservation of exercise capacity in patients randomized to LANOXIN. Continued treatment with LANOXIN reduced the risk of developing worsening heart failure, as evidenced by heart failure-related hospitalizations and emergency care and the need for concomitant heart failure therapy.

DIG Trial of LANOXIN in Patients with Heart Failure

The Digitalis Investigation Group (DIG) main trial was a 37-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind mortality study comparing digoxin to placebo in 6800 adult patients with heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 0.45. At randomization, 67% were NYHA class I or II, 71% had heart failure of ischemic etiology, 44% had been receiving digoxin, and most were receiving a concomitant ACE inhibitor (94%) and diuretics (82%). As in the smaller trials described above, patients who had been receiving open-label digoxin were withdrawn from this treatment before randomization. Randomization to digoxin was again associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of hospitalization, whether scored as number of hospitalizations for heart failure (relative risk 75%), risk of having at least one such hospitalization during the trial (RR 72%), or number of hospitalizations for any cause (RR 94%). On the other hand, randomization to digoxin had no apparent effect on mortality (RR 99%, with confidence limits of 91–107%).
