## Question

A mason has bricks with dimensions $2\times5\times8$ and other bricks with dimensions $2\times3\times7$. She also has a box with dimensions $10\times11\times14$. The bricks and the box are all rectangular parallelepipeds. The mason wants to pack bricks into the box filling its entire volume and with no bricks sticking out.
Find all possible values of the total number of bricks that she can pack.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for all possible values of the total number of bricks that can be packed into a box with dimensions 10×11×14, using bricks of dimensions 2×5×8 and 2×3×7, such that the entire volume is filled with no bricks sticking out. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the total volume constraint and what that implies for the number of bricks. Then, I should verify divisibility conditions that arise from aligning brick dimensions with box dimensions. Next, I will enumerate feasible combinations of the two brick types and check which ones satisfy both the volume and alignment constraints. Finally, I will double-check edge cases and summarize the valid totals.

> Let me first confirm the basic arithmetic. The box volume is 10×11×14 = 1540 cubic units. The 2×5×8 brick has volume 80, and the 2×3×7 brick has volume 42. If I use x bricks of the first type and y bricks of the second type, the total volume constraint is 80x + 42y = 1540, which simplifies to 40x + 21y = 770 after dividing by 2. I need to find non-negative integer solutions (x, y) to this equation, and then the total number of bricks will be x + y.

> Wait, let me verify the simplification and the implication. 40x + 21y = 770 implies that 21y must be congruent to 770 mod 40. Since 770 mod 40 is 10, I need 21y ≡ 10 (mod 40). Because gcd(21, 40) = 1, this congruence has a unique solution modulo 40. Let me solve it: 21y ≡ 10 (mod 40) leads to y ≡ 30 (mod 40), so y = 30 + 40k for integer k. Substituting back, 40x + 21(30 + 40k) = 770 gives 40x + 630 + 840k = 770, so 40x = 140 − 840k, and thus x = 3.5 − 21k. For x to be a non-negative integer, k must be 0, which yields x = 3.5, but that is not an integer. Hmm, wait a minute, I should double-check my modular arithmetic or the substitution, because a non-integer x suggests no solution, which contradicts the existence of integer solutions to 40x + 21y = 770. Let me reconsider: 770 is divisible by 2, and 40x + 21y = 770 implies that 21y must be even, so y must be even. Let y = 2m, then 40x + 42m = 770 simplifies to 20x + 21m = 385. Now I should solve 20x + 21m = 385 for non-negative integers x and m, and then y = 2m and total bricks = x + 2m.

> I will now examine the reduced equation 20x + 21m = 385. Let me think about bounds first. Since 20x ≤ 385, x ≤ 19.25, so x ≤ 19. Since 21m ≤ 385, m ≤ 18.33, so m ≤ 18. I can iterate over x from 0 to 19 and check when (385 − 20x) is divisible by 21. Alternatively, I can solve modulo 21: 20x ≡ 385 (mod 21). 385 mod 21 is 7, and 20 mod 21 is −1, so −x ≡ 7 (mod 21), which means x ≡ −7 ≡ 14 (mod 21). Thus x = 14 + 21k, but since x ≤ 19, the only feasible value is x = 14, which gives m = (385 − 20×14)/21 = (385 − 280)/21 = 105/21 = 5. So x = 14 and m = 5, which means y = 2m = 10, and total bricks = 14 + 10 = 24. Hold on, I should verify: 80×14 + 42×10 = 1120 + 420 = 1540, which matches the box volume, so this is a valid volume solution.

> But wait, what if I missed other solutions because I constrained x too quickly? Let me verify by checking neighboring values. If x = 14 + 21 = 35, that exceeds the bound x ≤ 19, so there are no other non-negative solutions to 20x + 21m = 385. Therefore, the only non-negative integer solution is x = 14, y = 10, giving a total of 24 bricks. Initially, I thought there might be multiple volume solutions, but I should correct that: there is exactly one non-negative integer solution to the volume equation, so if packing is possible at all, the total must be 24 bricks.

> Next, I should review whether this combination can actually be packed without gaps or overlaps. I need to ensure that the dimensions of the bricks align with the box dimensions in some orientation. The 2×5×8 brick has a 2-unit edge that can match the 2-unit divisors of the box dimensions, and the 2×3×7 brick has a 2-unit edge as well, which helps with alignment. Let me consider partitioning the box. One approach is to divide the 10×11×14 box into regions that each accommodate integer counts of bricks. For example, a 10×8×14 subregion can be filled with 2×5×8 bricks oriented appropriately, and the remaining 10×3×14 region can be filled with 2×3×7 bricks. I should confirm the arithmetic: 10×8×14 = 1120, which equals 80×14, and 10×3×14 = 420, which equals 42×10, so this partition matches the counts x = 14 and y = 10. This shows that a perfect packing exists in principle, though I should acknowledge that I am asserting geometric feasibility rather than detailing every orientation, and the volume and divisibility arguments strongly support that such a packing is possible.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about uniqueness of the total. I should confirm whether any other total brick count could satisfy both the volume and alignment constraints. Because the Diophantine equation 40x + 21y = 770 has only one non-negative integer solution, any valid packing must use exactly 14 of the larger bricks and 10 of the smaller bricks, for a total of 24 bricks. Therefore, the only possible value for the total number of bricks is 24.

The only possible total number of bricks that can pack the (10 \\times 11 \\times 14) box is **24 bricks** (14 of the (2 \\times 5 \\times 8) bricks and 10 of the (2 \\times 3 \\times 7) bricks). This is the unique solution because the total volume of the box is 1,540 cubic units, and the only integer solution to (80x + 42y = 1,540) is (x = 14) and (y = 10). A valid packing exists by aligning the 2-unit dimensions along the 10-unit side and arranging the bricks to fill the box without gaps.

---

## Volume analysis

- **Box volume**: (10 \\times 11 \\times 14 = 1,540) cubic units.
- **Brick volumes**: (2 \\times 5 \\times 8 = 80) cubic units and (2 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 42) cubic units.
- **Equation**: (80x + 42y = 1,540), where (x) is the number of (2 \\times 5 \\times 8) bricks and (y) is the number of (2 \\times 3 \\times 7) bricks.
- **Simplification**: Divide by 2 to get (40x + 21y = 770).

---

## Solving the Diophantine equation

We need non-negative integer solutions to (40x + 21y = 770).

- **Modulo 21**: (40x \\equiv 770 \\pmod{21}) simplifies to (-2x \\equiv 14 \\pmod{21}), so (x \\equiv -7 \\pmod{21}), or (x \\equiv 14 \\pmod{21}).
- **General solution**: (x = 14 + 21k) and (y = 10–40k) for integer (k).
- **Non-negative constraints**: (x \\geq 0) and (y \\geq 0) imply (k = 0), giving (x = 14) and (y = 10).

Thus, the unique solution is **14 of the (2 \\times 5 \\times 8) bricks and 10 of the (2 \\times 3 \\times 7) bricks**, for a total of **24 bricks**.

---

## Verification of packing feasibility

We must confirm that 14 bricks of (2 \\times 5 \\times 8) and 10 bricks of (2 \\times 3 \\times 7) can actually pack the (10 \\times 11 \\times 14) box.

- **Alignment**: Both brick types have a 2-unit dimension that can align with the 10-unit side, allowing 5 layers along that axis.
- **Layer structure**: Each layer is (10 \\times 11 \\times 2.8) (since (14 \\div 5 = 2.8)), but since heights must be integers, we use 5 layers of 2 units and adjust the remaining 4 units with the other bricks.
- **Practical packing**: A valid arrangement exists by placing the (2 \\times 5 \\times 8) bricks with their 2-unit sides along the 10-unit dimension and stacking them to fill the height, while the (2 \\times 3 \\times 7) bricks fill the remaining space efficiently.

---

## Conclusion

The only possible total number of bricks is **24**, consisting of 14 bricks of (2 \\times 5 \\times 8) and 10 bricks of (2 \\times 3 \\times 7). This is the unique solution that satisfies both the volume constraint and the requirement for a valid packing.

### Bringing greater transparency to "black box" warnings [^c89e1128]. Clinical Toxicology (2011). Low credibility.

The number of drugs with boxed warnings and the detail in the box are much greater in the USA than Australia. US warnings are up to ten times longer and often include a great deal of detail and qualified advice. Australian warnings are usually just a few sentences long and the expected response unequivocal. Other details are relegated to the relevant section within the product information. The restriction of warnings such that they are succinct and used sparingly are explicitly highlighted in the guidelines for boxed warnings in Australia. In addition, the range of other risk management strategies used may be broader. Widespread prescription drug subsidies and mechanisms set up to implement the "Quality Use of Medicines" policy provide a complementary range of options. Withdrawal of registration, removal of subsidies for all or selected indications, changed product information and labels, consumer-targeted information, prescriber mail outs, education programmes, restriction to authorised prescribers, and changed pack size and packaging have all been applied at some time in response to safety concerns. The diversity of approaches around the world provides an opportunity for a systematic approach to look at the effects of boxed warnings on prescribing practices so that we might discover what works best. While there are many studies on the effect of warnings from the USA, there are few comparable studies done where different approaches are used. Further, it is not possible to easily examine the total number and purpose of boxed warnings via any government websites. If there were always explicit and potentially verifiable changes in practice as the stated goal for each boxed warning in each jurisdiction and a requirement that the effectiveness of the intervention was measured against these goals, then we might have the evidence base for better policy around boxed warnings.

### Portion, package or tableware size for changing selection and consumption of food, alcohol and tobacco [^78324d15]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

'Portion' refers to the overall amount (volume, weight or both) of a product that is presented for selection or consumption (for example, 200 g versus 300 g of pasta, 275 ml versus 440 ml of beer, or a packet of 10 versus 20 cigarettes). 'Package' refers to the different ways of packaging a specific portion, including that used for service, consumption or storage (for example, boxes, bags, cans or bottles). For example, the same portion of a food could be served within one large bag or multiple smaller bags. 'Individual unit' refers to the unit of a product that is presented within a given portion (for example, individual sweets or candies, biscuits or cookies, or cigarettes). 'Tableware' refers to crockery, cutlery or glassware used for serving or consuming food or drink (for example, plates, bowls, knives, forks, spoons or glasses). Packages and tableware as defined in this way have the capacity to limit or increase the portion or individual unit size of the consumed product and may therefore influence any corollary effects on selection and consumption.

### Metamaterial bricks and quantization of meta-surfaces [^b8747088]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The results reported in this paper reveal an algorithm for the fabrication of quantal meta-surfaces with well-controlled arbitrary 2D phase distributions using 3D metamaterial bricks. The concept of our method was inspired from analogue-to-digital conversion and image compression. Here, the AD conversion denotes a process in which a continuously variable (analogue) phase distribution is changed, without altering its essential content, into a multi-level (digital) phase. A quantal meta-surface becomes in effect a digital phase processing system operating as an SLM. As summarized in Fig. 1, three possible routes can be considered to realize a quantal meta-surface. First, we start with a spatial resolution of λ 0 /2 and 4-bit uniform representation of the analogue phase (Fig. 1a). This method is similar to what has been reported by other authors. Second, we treat the phase distribution as an image and use a wavelet transform to perform a lossy compression (Fig. 1b). In this way, the number of bits necessary to represent the analogue phase is reduced to 3, while maintaining the error in reproducing the field below 0.1 dB: this has been explored in Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 4. There is however a lossless alternative (Fig. 1c), where we can exploit the additivity of phase and the hierarchical properties of wavelet transforms. These transforms result in a branched tree to represent the structure of the decomposition; at a given level, each of the branch (that is, meta-surface) can be layered to form a stack with a smaller number of unique bricks. An example where this route is applied to a focusing field is reported in Supplementary Fig. 5. Here, the analogue phase is represented with 3.5 bits and a stack of 4 quantal meta-surfaces. In this solution, each meta-surface is made of ‘blocks'—that is, unit cells of dimension λ 0, each made of a 2 × 2 structure of identical bricks. While the spatial resolution of the bricks has to remain lower than λ 0 /2 to reduce higher order diffraction, the presence of blocks makes mechanical assembly much simpler, which is a key aspect of cost-effective devices based, for example, on active meta-materials.

### Adaptive hierarchical origami-based metastructures [^a0ef7e91]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Rapidly deployable and scalable self-reconfigurable architectures

Moreover, the compact level-2 structure can effectively self-transform and rapidly deploy into architectural forms resembling bridges, tunnels, and shelters (Fig. 6a, b and Supplementary Movie 6), both with and without internal looped structures. This transformation occurs within 2 min, a notable advance compared to previous studies that required several hours and complex algorithms,–. Additionally, it can rapidly self-deploy into a fully open multi-story building-like structure, expanding its occupied volume fourfold (Fig. 6b, v). It can also quickly revert to a compact large cube (Fig. 6b, iv and Supplementary Movie 6). Due to its specific structural features (Supplementary Fig. 23, see more details in Supplementary Note 10), the reconfigured level-2 structure can bear substantial loads without collapsing, such as approximately 13 kg (over 3.5 times its self-weight) for the bridge- or tunnel-like structures and about 10 kg (over 2.5 times its self-weight) for the multi-story structure (Fig. 6c).

Notably, during the self-deployment from a compact planar structure to a complex multi-story open structure in Fig. 6b, the number of active motors remains low, never exceeding 3, despite the total number of 36 joints and 22 motors (Fig. 6d). For example, during the reconfiguration from the compact cube to the fully open structure (Fig. 6b, iv–v), only 2 active servomotors drive the rotation of 16 joints (Fig. 6d), demonstrating high reconfiguration efficiency.

As proof of concept, we demonstrate that these spatial hierarchical mechanism designs can be up-scaled to meter-sized buildings by assembling heavy-duty cardboard packing boxes (box side length 0.6 m). Starting from flat-packed cardboards with minimal space requirements, they can be rapidly assembled for easy deployment and reconfiguration into various structurally stable meter-scale tunnels, shelters, and multi-story open structures (Fig. 7a and Supplementary Movie 7). Remarkably, the total volume occupied by the deployed multi-story open architecture is 200 times larger than the initial volume of the flat-packed cardboards (Supplementary Fig. 24). Collectively, these properties make the proposed design promising for potential applications as temporary emergency shelters and other autonomously rapidly deployable and reconfigurable temporary buildings.

The manufacturer will label the blister packs with lot numbers, enclose the blister packs in boxes, and place the 0.4 and 4 mg boxes in separate containers. An independent contractor will label the pillboxes, at the manufacturer’s facility, with the serial numbers that are matched to randomization assignment. The labeling will be conducted under RTI’s supervision (see section 4.1.1). The accuracy of the labeling will be independently tested, before sending the pills to the sites, through randomly selecting and sending to RTI a sample of boxes that are labeled with the serial numbers. RTI will compare the lot numbers on the blister packs to the serial numbers on the pillboxes to ensure that serial numbers and lot numbers match correctly. Further, the pills from this sample will be sent to an independent laboratory in the US to conduct assay content tests to ensure that the folic acid dose matches the treatment assignment of the lot numbers (0.4 versus 4 mg). These steps will identify errors in labeling the blister packs and in labeling with serial numbers. The latter can result due to incorrect packaging the pillboxes into the 0.4 and 4mg containers by the manufacturer or due to inaccurate serial number labeling by the contractor.

Different procedures will be used to address labeling errors depending on the error type. Errors in serial number labeling will require verifying the lot numbers inside each pillbox to ensure that they match the assigned serial number and relabeling those that do not match. All the pillboxes will be rechecked when this error occurs. Errors in blister pack labeling will require production and labeling of new pills, which will be test using the procedures described above.

Pills will not be sent to the sites before all the quality control procedures are completed. This necessitates that pill orders are placed at least 5 months before the intended date of shipping to the sites.

Other outcomes

Responses to the end of study questionnaire are described in Supporting information, Material 6. We report here only responses to the question regarding preferred pack size, following completion of the study.

Eighty‐two per cent of participants (n = 234) preferred using packs of 25, 16% preferred using packs of 20 and 2% expressed no preference. For those preferring pack sizes of 25, the most cited reason was that the packs of 25s lasted longer (n = 62). Among those preferring pack sizes of 20, the most cited reason was that they smoked fewer cigarettes (n = 15) (see Box 1).

### Opportunities and barriers for smaller portions in food service: lessons from marketing and behavioral economics [^79ae89a1]. International Journal of Obesity (2014). Low credibility.

Elongate packages and servings of energy-dense items

If smaller default portions are used, they can be packaged and presented in such a way as to limit the extent to which they are noticed. Research by Chandon and Ordabayevahas shown that people are much more likely to notice downsizes when a package changes in only one dimension. In one experiment, the researchers first showed consumers a small serving of movie popcorn in a cube-shaped 24 oz bucket. When the bucket was enlarged in all three dimensions into a 110-oz cube, consumers estimated the volume to be only 54 oz. When, instead, the bucket was enlarged in only one dimension, into an elongated 110-oz box, consumers still underestimated the volume, but they were much closer, with an average estimate of 81 oz. Chandon and Ordabayeva conclude that less healthy products should be served in ‘elongated' packages to give the perception of large size, without actually serving such large quantities. This is a fast-brain strategy because customers do not have to stop and reflect on a choice to take a smaller portion—fast and automatic brain processes lead them to perceive a smaller portion as being large enough. Accordingly, it can be effective with both eager and reluctant consumers.

This packaging change is a real opportunity, but it is not without revenue and cost barriers. In some cases, especially for take-out food, the elongating of the package may not preserve heat as well, or it may fit differently into bags, or visually customers may not be used to it. Research and development efforts could test these issues, but such efforts will not be costless.

For in-store dining, this elongation approach could work with smaller defaults. If Applebee's, for example, reduced its standard French fry portion, fewer people would presumably notice if they managed to plate the French fries in an elongated manner, thus reducing the possible revenue risk. Servers would have to be trained to serve fries in this manner, and they may need to be careful about how this is explained to guests, if guests ever asked. For operations where value erosion is a major concern in reducing portions, the costs of changing packaging or plating may be worth absorbing.

### Fractal-feature distance analysis of radiographic image [^3bffb909]. Academic Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

We have conducted a fractal analysis of low-dose digital chest phantom radiographs and evaluated the relationship between the fractal-feature distance and the tube current-exposure time product.

Materials and Methods

Chest phantom radiographs were obtained at various mAs values (0.5-4.0 mAs) and 140 kVp with a computed radiography system, and the reference images were acquired at 13 mAs. The lung field images were converted to binary images after processing them using the rolling-ball technique; a fractal analysis was conducted using the box-counting method for these binary images. The fractal-feature distances between the low-dose and reference images were calculated using the fractal dimension and the complexity.

Results

For all binary images of lung fields, the relationship between the length of the square boxes and the number of boxes needed to cover the positive pixels of the binary image was linear on a log-log scale (r > or = 0.99). For mAs > or = 3.0, the fractal-feature distances were almost constant, whereas for mAs < or = 2.5, they increased depending on the reduction in mAs values.

Conclusion

We have shown that a binary image of the lung field obtained from a chest phantom radiograph can be analyzed by the box-counting method and that its fractal-feature distance grows as the radiation dose declines.

### Cigarette pack size and consumption: a randomized cross-over trial [^2d3c2ed1]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

Randomization

Allocation of participants to the order in which they completed the conditions was determined using a computer‐generated random number sequence prepared by one of the project statisticians (R.M.), using Stata version 15 (StataCorp LLC, TX, USA). Block randomization was used to generate an equal number of participants allocated to each treatment order and to reduce the potential of selection bias compared to simple randomization. The blocks were in sizes of 2, 4 and 6. The random number sequence, with IDs for the sequence of potential participants, was concealed from the research team, research agency and participants until the participant had consented to take part in the study and shown that they were able to purchase their usual brand variant of cigarettes in packs of 20 and packs of 25. When a participant was deemed eligible for randomization the research team accessed the next random allocation in the sequence, and this participant was assigned the corresponding ID. Instructions (see Supporting information, Material 1) were e‐mailed and mailed to participants, together with a set of stickers to attach to all the cigarette packs from which they would smoke during the intervention periods.

The stickers had space to record the following information: (i) participant ID; (ii) pack number; (iii) date the pack was finished; (iv) a rating from 1 to 7 for the effectiveness of the warning label (to bolster the credibility of the cover story); (v) number of cigarettes smoked themselves from the pack; (vi) number of cigarettes smoked from other non‐study packs while this study pack was open (e.g. given to them by a friend); and (vii) number of cigarettes remaining (for partially empty packs at the end of a study period).

On day 1 of each intervention period, participants were e‐mailed a reminder to only smoke their usual cigarette brand variant of cigarettes from packs of the appropriate size, as randomized.

On day 7 of each intervention period, participants sent photographs of all the cigarette packs they had finished since day 1. After smoking the last cigarette on day 14, participants sent photographs of all the cigarette packs they had smoked from since day 7, including any partially empty packs.

At the end of each intervention period, participants completed questionnaires about their smoking and cigarette purchasing during the study. Participants received Can$400 for completing the study procedures, and purchased their own cigarettes during the study.

Brick is cut using a diamond saw (±0.03 cm error) into the following 4 different sizes: 1.00 cm ⨯ 0.50 cm ⨯ 0.28 cm (for studying synthesis and electrochemistry), 1.27 cm ⨯ 1.27 cm ⨯ 0.20 cm (for patterning), 2.00 cm ⨯ 1.00 cm ⨯ 1.00 cm (for scaled-up supercapacitor) and 10.16 cm ⨯ 6.77 cm ⨯ 5.72 cm (for scaled-up synthesis). A brick is thrice washed with deionized water to remove surface dust then dried at 160 °C for 1 h and cooled to room temperature.

The syntheses of all types of 1 cm ⨯ 0.5 cm ⨯ 0.28 cm brick are performed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave as shown in Fig. 1a. A brick is placed on a glass reservoir then 200 µL of a 0.85 M EDOT/chlorobenzene solution is loaded in a separate glass reservoir and 30 µL of 12 M HCl is directly injected in the Teflon liner. The reactor is closed and introduced into an oven at 160 °C for 14 h. The product is washed thrice with excess methanol and dried at room temperature before carrying out tests. Similarly, the synthesis of a 2 cm ⨯ 1 cm ⨯ 1 cm brick is performed in a 125 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave using 600 µL of a 0.70 M EDOT in chlorobenzene solution and 75 µL of 12 M HCl.

### CHARMM-GUI multicomponent assembler for modeling and simulation of complex multicomponent systems [^c084dc2e]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

STEP 4 – Build solution

The water and ion building procedures in this study follow the same protocols as in Solution Builder,,, with the additional ability to utilize user-uploaded ions. Users can build any combination of ions supported by the CHARMM36 FF, containing up to 7 atoms, in addition to uploading custom ions. Solvent options allow users to specify either the concentration of any solvent, including water, or a solvent density and ratio of solvent volumes. The solvent options page estimates the number of each generated solvent and ion with the user’s settings, although the exact number may differ as described below in STEP 5.

To maintain the approximate solvent ratios, user-uploaded solvent molecules are initially packed into a small box whose size is chosen based on heuristics. The packing procedure follows the same protocols described in STEP 2. After packing, the box is replicated to reach the target box size, and any molecules outside the system boundaries are deleted.

STEP 5 – Assemble system

The solvent and non-solvent components are combined by superimposing the solvents with the non-solvents and deleting any solvent molecules that collide with non-solvent molecules within 2.8 Å. If the system contains a membrane or XY periodic component, solvents located in the component’s interior (as defined by the user in STEP 2) are also deleted. If a solvent is present in a higher concentration than the user’s target, extras are deleted randomly as needed. However, extra solvent molecules are not created to fill space when system assembly results in fewer than the target number of molecules. Finally, any uploaded components with the segment ID MEMB and membrane generated by Membrane Builder (if any) are joined into a single segment, so that appropriate restraints can be generated in STEP 6.

STEP 6 – Generate simulation inputs

MCA uses FF-Converter to generate simulation inputs for various MD engines,. For systems containing periodic nanomaterials or polymers, the generated NVT (constant number of particles, volume, and temperature) equilibration inputs use a multi-step scheme where protein restraints are progressively released. Inputs generated for NPT (constant number of particles, pressure, and temperature) production use anisotropic pressure coupling, and NPAT (constant number of particles, pressure, membrane area, and temperature) production inputs use semi-isotropic pressure coupling with pressure applied only along the Z dimension.

### SMART lunch box intervention to improve the food and nutrient content of children's packed lunches: UK wide cluster randomised controlled trial [^38571245]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Government standards are now in place for children's school meals but not for lunches prepared at home. The aim of this trial is to improve the content of children's packed lunches.

Methods

A cluster randomised controlled trial in 89 primary schools across the UK involving 1291 children, age 8-9&emsp14;years at baseline. Follow-up was 12&emsp14;months after baseline. A "SMART" lunch box intervention programme consisted of food boxes, bag and supporting materials. The main outcome measures were weights of foods and proportion of children provided with sandwiches, fruit, vegetables, dairy food, savoury snacks and confectionery in each packed lunch. Levels of nutrients provided including energy, total fat, saturated fat, protein, non-milk extrinsic sugar, sodium, calcium, iron, folate, zinc, vitamin A and vitamin C.

Results

Moderately higher weights of fruit, vegetables, dairy and starchy food and lower weights of savoury snacks were provided to children in the intervention group. Children in the intervention group were provided with slightly higher levels of vitamin A and folate. 11% more children were provided with vegetables/salad in their packed lunch, and 13% fewer children were provided with savoury snacks (crisps). Children in the intervention group were more likely to be provided with packed lunches meeting the government school meal standards.

Conclusions

The SMART lunch box intervention, targeting parents and children, led to small improvements in the food and nutrient content of children's packed lunches. Further interventions are required to bring packed lunches in line with the new government standards for school meals. Current controlled trials ISRCTN77710993.

### "Pack year" smoking histories: what about patients who use loose tobacco? [^6f6b4e96]. Tobacco Control (2005). Low credibility.

Life time smoking of ready made cigarettes can be readily quantified as "pack years" smoked, but methods for measuring loose tobacco use are less well established. In this study the frequency of loose tobacco use by 247 hospital in-patients was determined; 64% were current or ex-smokers, 41.3% of whom (25.9% of participants) had smoked loose tobacco. A formula was developed for converting loose tobacco use to pack years smoked, based on the weight of tobacco in ready made cigarettes; 12.5 g or half an ounce of loose tobacco was approximately equivalent to one packet of 20 cigarettes. Using a questionnaire it was found that hospital physicians of all grades were able to convert smoking histories of ready made cigarettes, but not loose tobacco, into number of "pack years" smoked.

### Water, sanitation, and hygiene practices in urban slums of Eastern India [^bf85823d]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Between November 2017 and December 2019, 5991 children were under active surveillance; 258 children were lost to follow-up during the study period. In the first round of the survey, 4104 households were included and 3906 were surveyed in the second round. Because several families contributed multiple eligible children to the study cohort, the number of households under observation was lower than the number of children enrolled in the study.

The sociodemographic characteristics of the study population are presented in Table 1. We stratified the characteristics by the 2 rounds of the survey. In both rounds, a large proportion of the participating families were nuclear in nature, with a median family size of 5 (interquartile range [IQR], 4–6). Most of the families resided in single-room households, as is normal for the area under study. The median monthly family income was slightly higher in round 2 (median Indian rupee [INR] 9000; IQR, INR 8000–12 000) than in round 1 (median INR, 8000; IQR, INR 7000–10 000). A large proportion of the families resided in houses that were mixed kutcha-pucca in construction. Less than half of the households had a separate kitchen and most cooking activities were conducted inside the house. A very small proportion reported to have backyard poultry rearing or cattle of any kind in both the rounds. For classifying houses, we followed the definition laid down in the Statistical Year Book of the Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation of the Government of India. A pucca house was a permanent one with walls made of burnt bricks, stones packed with lime or cement, cement, concrete, or packed timber, and roof made of tiles, galvanized corrugated iron sheets, asbestos cement sheet, reinforced brick concrete, or reinforced cement concrete. Kutcha houses had roofs and walls made from less-permanent materials such as unburnt bricks, bamboos, mud, grass, reeds, thatch, loosely packed stones, to name a few.

### Cigarette pack size and consumption: a randomized cross-over trial [^a09014da]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Participant characteristics

Of the 538 smokers referred by the research agency, 349 (65%) met the eligibility criteria, of whom 252 (72%) consented to participate and were randomized to one of the two study arms (Figure 1). Of those randomized, 240 (95%) completed the study; 236 (94%) provided sufficient data for the primary analysis of the primary outcome.

FIGURE 1 
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) flow diagram

Demographic characteristics appeared comparable between participants who completed the study (n = 240, 94%) and those who did not (n = 12; 6%) (Table 1). Those completing the study were predominantly female (n = 171, 71%) and white (n = 208; 87%), with a mean age of 46 years (SD = 12). Forty‐five per cent of participants (n = 104) had household incomes less than the average of approximately Can$60 000, with 21% (n = 51) having one or more university degrees. Participants were deemed to be adherent to study instructions if at least 90% of the cigarette packs from which they had smoked during each of the two intervention periods were of the correct size, the correct cigarette length and brand variant, and if they did not deviate significantly from study instructions. Of the 4952 photographs of cigarette packs received from 240 participants, seven were of the incorrect pack size. The per‐protocol analysis excluded 21 participants that were deemed non‐adherent. See Supporting information, Material 3 for more information.

TABLE 1 
Demographic and baseline smoking characteristics of participants.

Of the 4952 cigarette packs, 58 had at least one piece of information missing, either from the sticker or information relating to the cigarette type (brand variant, length or size). Of the 236 participants included in the primary analysis of the primary outcome, 12 had missing information imputed for the primary outcome. See the OSF registration for the protocol that was followed for handling missing information, which assumes any missing packs were missing at random.

The data that form the basis of the results presented here are available from the University of Cambridge Research Data Repository,.

### Consumption of systemic antibiotics in India in 2019 [^43db1f41]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2022). High credibility.

We calculated the total DDD consumed per pack using the product and pack size information from the PharmaTrac data and the corresponding formulation's DDD information from the WHO ATC/DDD index 2019 list. The DDD per pack was then multiplied by the total number of packs (MAT) consumed per year to obtain the total DDD of the product for the whole year. We then summed up the DDD at the molecule level and divided the sum by 365 and population to obtain DID values. We used the projected mid-year population for 2019 obtained from the National Population Commission. The detailed steps and the formulas are described in Supplement Box 1.

We used the following standards for molecules not included in the ATC/DDD index. Wherever DDD values were not available for oral formulations, we used DDD of parenteral formulation or vice-versa; examples include ceftazidime and clarithromycin. For those FDCs with one penicillin and an enzyme inhibitor (ATC (code J01CR), we applied the DDD value of the corresponding penicillin component (Supplement Table 1). In the case of FDCs with only one active antibiotic molecule (the other component being a non-antibiotic), we used the ATC code and DDD value of the antibiotic molecule, following the WHO 2020 guidelines. For FDCs of two or more penicillins with or without enzyme inhibitors (ATC code J01CR50) and other FDCs with two or more antibiotics, we added the DDDs of the individual antibiotics. For balofloxacin and levonadifloxacin, we used the DDD of levofloxacin as they belong to the same class (Supplement Table 2). We matched all the spellings from PharmaTrac with the WHO ATC database and retained the spellings from the latter. (Supplement Table 3) PharmaTrac did not specify the strengths of 85 brands in the database. For them, we used data from the Tata 1mg web portal  that provides curated and verified product information or from the respective pharmaceutical manufacturer's websites.

### A critical edge number revealed for phase stabilities of two-dimensional ball-stick polygons [^a6f67245]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

“More is different”. People have accumulated extensive knowledge on both the entropy-limited case and the enthalpy-limited case for 2D systems, as well as the thermodynamic and spatial competitions between these two factors. Real 2D systems, however, stand in between, involving comparable entropy and enthalpy effects, whose phase behaviors are more abundant than either of the two above cases. This work reveals some interesting and unique physical features in 2D molecular systems, as well as establishes a theoretical framework which can be generalized to understand phase behaviors in more complex 2D systems. Besides its fundamental importance, our research is also valuable for the design of 2D materials at least in two aspects: (1) When there is a strong anisotropy induced by molecular shape or intermolecular interaction, the details of short-range interactions are crucial for designing various structures, such as amorphous materials used for frustrated magnetic materials, and distorted lattice which is generally existed in some compound systems, e.g. high-entropy alloys, widely used for tuning the mechanical propertiesor the electron band structures; (2) Phase stability at high pressures is mainly determined by shape, but at low pressures it can be tamed by the match of interaction and shape, which can facilitate the design of materials with desired physical features, such as ultra-stability and heat-sensitivity.

In our simulation, the deformation or elongation of the polygon can be ignored due to the large strengths of the bond and angle interactions (see Methods for more details). Since the mechanism we have provided above does not explicitly depend on bond length, we argue that our conclusion is still effective for the normal case of molecules. However, many studies have shown exotic melting scenarios and ground-state configurations when the polygon is allowed to deform –. Moreover, the melting scenarios of polygon mixtures may differ from identical polygon systems attributed to the much more complicated competition among various ingredients. Considerations on these two factors may lead to a comprehensive understanding in the shape space and reveal the critical behavior in the vicinity of, but are beyond the scope of our study. In real applications, 2D materials have to be supported on a substrate. Although many substrates are known to have little influences on crystalline structures,, some well-designed substrates may be used for taming melting scenarios. The consideration on the effect of substrates might result in a more complex competition between entropy and enthalpy, leading to the emergence of new structures, and providing more guidance on experiments and industrial applications of 2D materials.

### Oral cleft prevention program (OCPP) [^8fdc5a9c]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Study treatments

The study drugs are folic acid in concentrations of 4mg (high dose) and 0.4mg (low dose). The study drugs are supplied in tablet form, manufactured by ATIVUS Pharmaceutical Industries in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Quality control assessments of samples of production batches will be performed for all manufacturers in an independent quality control lab in the United States (Celsis Laboratory Group, Saint Louis, US). All pills, regardless of their folic acid concentration, will be identical in size, shape, and color and will be provided in identical packaging. Patients enrolled in the study will be instructed to ingest 1 tablet daily from enrollment until 3 months gestation.

The manufacturers will package the folic acid pills in boxes containing 5 blister packs of 14 pills each (2 rows of 7 pills), for a total of 70 pills per box. Each box will contain an information sheet that will include all recommendations of the country’s drug monitoring agencies (ANVISA for Brazil) regarding information about the drug, yet will not reveal in any way the actual folic acid content. The manufacturer will also label each of the pill boxes with the following information, in addition to any other item that is recommended by the monitoring agency:

Manufacturing and expiration dates (including only the month and the year of production which will be common for the two doses of folic acid)

Description of the drug (folic acid)

Identification of the manufacturer

Statement about the use of the drug (“this product is solely intended for research use and shall not be commercialized”)

Patient instructions for taking pills (or if a daily dose is missed)

Clearance number of monitoring agency

Clinic’s logo

The manufacturers will also label the blister packs with a production lot number. Each production run of pills will use several lot numbers for each dose. The lot numbers pertaining to each dose will be sent from the manufacturer directly to RTI after each production run.

After each production, RTI staff will supervise labeling the pillboxes with a serial number (##### - ##, a seven digit number with 5 digit base number and 2 check digits). A local staff independent of the study may be used to label the pill boxes.

There will not be any information on the pill box or blister pack that may indicate to the subject the folic acid content of the pills.

A sample of pills from the boxes will be selected from each production lot to be sent out for independent assay of folate content to assure manufacturing compliance.

### Dynamic control of DNA condensation [^e662d265]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

These experimental and computational results are consistent with recent observations we made on a similar system in which 3 arm nanostars include one arm that is protected through a hairpin. Like here, a critical ratio of active/inactive nanostars around 0.5 was required for condensate formation.

Dissolution of droplets formed by monomers of variable size

Our theoretical model predicts that dissolution speed depends on the diffusion rate of the inhibitor molecule (Fig. 1D). To test whether we could change the diffusion of invaders into the condensate and thus droplet dissolution speed, we varied the length of nanostar arms between 8 and 24 base pairs (bp) (Fig. 4A). Because we considered arm lengths well below the persistence length of double-stranded DNA (50 nm, around 150 nt), it is reasonable to expect that longer arms yield droplets that are less densely packed and more permeable to invaders.

Square: distorted square lattice

Based on the result from REMD simulation and the consideration on symmetry, the initial state was established as a square lattice shown in Fig. 5a, where the body-orientation of each monomer is not perpendicular to the primary vector of lattice to ensure a higher packing fraction. MD simulations at various temperatures were performed at P = 0. The apparent discontinuous changes in the caloric curve, density curve, andplotted in Fig. 5b manifest a first-order phase transition from solid to liquid with the melting point located between 2.92 and 2.93.

PRISMA study flow diagram.

We excluded 101 study reports based on full‐text screening. Primary reasons for exclusion are summarised in Figure 2 (PRISMA flow diagram) and in the Characteristics of excluded studies table. A further four full‐text study reports were conference abstracts with insufficient information to enable confident assessment of eligibility (Loney 2010, Martinez 2010, Schmidt 2013, Skov 2013). Brief details of these four studies are provided in Characteristics of studies awaiting classification tables. Therefore, following exclusions, identification and linking of multiple eligible study reports of the same study and identification of study reports comprising multiple eligible studies, we have identified a total of 83 studies as meeting the eligibility criteria for this review (from 78 full‐text study reports). The number of included studies exceeds the number of included study reports due to the comparative incidences of study reports that report multiple studies (i.e. two or more studies reported in the same publication) and studies reported in single or multiple study reports among studies/reports that we identified as meeting eligibility criteria for this review.

### The airborne transmission of viruses causes tight transmission bottlenecks [^8bb3e96b]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Calculating individual exposures

We generated values c (x, r, t) at time intervals of one second for a period of one hour following each emission event. The initial values c (x, r,0) were scaled so that the total volume, summed across particle sizes, was equal to the desired volume of the emission. In order to calculate the total exposure of person i at the location x i = { x i, y i }, we generated values c (x, r, t) at positions in the square grid centred on x i, with dimension 40 cm, and containing points at resolution 2 cm, finding the mean value of c in this grid. The volume of the space represented by this box is 0.16 Z, where Z is the height of the room so that we can calculate the density of viral particles of radius r in the box. Given a parameter A, describing the rate of air inhalation by a person, we calculated the expected number of particles of radius r inhaled within a  1 second interval at time t. Summing these values over times t, we obtained an expected number of particles of radius r inhaled in a 1 hour period following a single emission event. Summing these values over multiple emission events, we obtained an expected number of particles of radius r inhaled over the entire model period. We denote this number as P i (r).

For each uninfected individual in our model, we generated a Poisson random variable

describing the number of particles of radius r inhaled by that person. This number was converted into a number of effective viruses: For each such particle, the expected number of effective viruses is given bywhere k b is the effective viral load of particles at the point of emission. To calculate the effective number of viruses inhaled via particles of radius r, we calculated a second Poisson random variable

The transmission bottleneck related to the person i was finally calculated as the sum of these values:

Person i was considered to have been infected if and only if N i > 0. Statistics of bottlenecks were calculated across cases of infection.

For each scenario considered, we calculated 10 6 independent simulations, generating N i for each individual in each simulation. Statistics were collated across simulations.

Calculation of k b

By default the effective viral load was calculated using an epidemiological model. Details are given in the Supplementary Information. A broad range of values of k b were considered.

### A critical edge number revealed for phase stabilities of two-dimensional ball-stick polygons [^2f24595e]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

All the simulations started from the crystalline state unless otherwise specified and were performed at each temperature independently. To construct a crystalline structure, the unit-cell structure was first determined and then duplicated along two primary lattice vectors. In our polygonal systems, we determined the unit-cell structure by careful examination on the final structure from the REMD simulations described below. For triangle, the unit-cell contains two monomers with opposite body-orientations, as shown in Fig. 2c ; for the other four polygons, the unit-cell is just a monomer. The exact values of the two primary lattice vectors were calculated by geometrical construction, taking the effective radius of each L-J particle into account. For the simulations of the triangular system starting from a crystalline structure with a locally disordered region, the initial configuration is prepared by the following procedure: At a relatively high temperature of T = 2.88, the triangular system becomes amorphous spontaneously. When this happens, we select a snapshot with a small disordered region (about 30 monomers). This snapshot is then used as the initial configuration for related simulations.

### Tbo-filgrastim (Granix) [^fde6140a]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

For example: If your prescribed dose is 1 mL you would prepare 1 syringe with 0.8 mL and a second syringe with 0.2 mL.

Important : When using 2 syringes always adjust the first syringe to 0.8 mL.

How to read the syringe markings

What the markings on the syringe mean:

The syringe is labeled in 0.1 mL unit increments from 0.1 mL to 0.8 mL. There is a line next to each 0.1 mL unit increment.

To read the dose scale always hold the syringe with the needle-end facing up so that 0.1 mL is at the top and 0.8 mL is at the bottom.

How to adjust the medicine level for your prescribed dose

When setting your dose, (See 2C) you will line up the top edge of the grey rubber stopper with the line on the syringe scale that matches your prescribed dose.
Note : The top edge of the grey rubber stopper is the edge directly below the dome at the top of the stopper.

Do not use the top of the cone or the middle or lower edges of the grey stopper to measure your dose.

### ASPEN safe practices for enteral nutrition therapy [ formula: see text ] [^27e953f5]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Enteral nutrition (EN) order components and supplementary/electronic orders—The EN delivery site with correct route and EAD is described as a critical element of the EN order, and identifying the site for EN and medication administration can decrease the possibility of EN administration via the wrong access when more than 1 port or access device is present. The EN order includes the method of administration (pump, gravity, or bolus), the EN infusion rate, and an infusion schedule that lists infusion times and initial rate or volume, includes an advancement rate/volume and the total volume to be infused within the 24-hour period, identifies volume and frequency for water flushes, and specifies whether EN is given by continuous drip, intermittent drip, cyclic drip, or bolus delivery. Organizations can implement standardized electronic order sets that prevent prescribers from ordering improper administration methods for specific EADs, for example allowing jejunostomy feedings only by continuous feeding administration; supplementary orders can assist with advancement of EN, transitions between PN, EN, and oral diet or care settings, and address HOB elevation, enteral feeding tube care, GRV checks, and monitoring and laboratory parameters. Electronic order sets can help prescribers determine whether a base EN formula provides adequate macronutrient content for a 24-hour period or if modular macronutrients are needed; patients with fluid tolerance limits may need augmentation of base EN formulas with a modular macronutrient to increase calories without additional fluid, populations with high protein needs may need additional protein modulars, and those requiring protein restriction may benefit from carbohydrate or fat modulars. Institutions can include micronutrient, electrolyte, and water content of EN formulas in CPOE information boxes to help prescribers select EN products for patients with electrolyte imbalances or conditions where micronutrients are either not eliminated properly or are depleted with high-volume fluid losses.

### What is the standard volume to increase a cup size for breast augmentation surgery? A novel three-dimensional computed tomographic approach [^136832d4]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Breast augmentation surgery poses many challenges, and meeting the patient's expectations is one of the most important. Previous reports equate 100 cc to a one-cup-size increase; however, no studies have confirmed this between commercially available bras. The aim of this study was to identify the volume increase between cup sizes across different brands and the relationship with implant selection.

Methods

Five bra cup sizes from three different companies were analyzed for their volume capacity. Three methods were used to calculate the volume of the bras: (1) linear measurements; (2) volume measurement by means of water displacement; and (3) volume calculation after three-dimensional reconstruction of serial radiographic data (computed tomography). The clinical arm consisted of 79 patients who underwent breast augmentation surgery from February 1, 2014, to June 30, 2016. Answers from a short questionnaire in combination with the implant volume were analyzed.

Results

Across all three brands, the interval volume increase varied between sizes, but not all were above 100 cc. There was some variation in the volume capacity of the same cup size among the different brands. The average incremental increase in bra cup size across all three brands in the laboratory arm was 135 cc. The mean volume increase per cup size was 138.23 cc in the clinical arm.

Conclusions

This article confirms that there is no standardization within the bra manufacturing industry. On the basis of this study, patients should be advised that 130 to 150 cc equates to a one-cup-size increase. Bras with narrower band widths need 130 cc and wider band widths require 150 cc to increase one cup size.

### Portion, package or tableware size for changing selection and consumption of food, alcohol and tobacco [^58cbe01c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Overeating and harmful alcohol and tobacco use have been linked to the aetiology of various non-communicable diseases, which are among the leading global causes of morbidity and premature mortality. As people are repeatedly exposed to varying sizes and shapes of food, alcohol and tobacco products in environments such as shops, restaurants, bars and homes, this has stimulated public health policy interest in product size and shape as potential targets for intervention.

Objectives

1) To assess the effects of interventions involving exposure to different sizes or sets of physical dimensions of a portion, package, individual unit or item of tableware on unregulated selection or consumption of food, alcohol or tobacco products in adults and children.2) To assess the extent to which these effects may be modified by study, intervention and participant characteristics.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, eight other published or grey literature databases, trial registries and key websites up to November 2012, followed by citation searches and contacts with study authors. This original search identified eligible studies published up to July 2013, which are fully incorporated into the review. We conducted an updated search up to 30 January 2015 but further eligible studies are not yet fully incorporated due to their minimal potential to change the conclusions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials with between-subjects (parallel-group) or within-subjects (cross-over) designs, conducted in laboratory or field settings, in adults or children. Eligible studies compared at least two groups of participants, each exposed to a different size or shape of a portion of a food (including non-alcoholic beverages), alcohol or tobacco product, its package or individual unit size, or of an item of tableware used to consume it, and included a measure of unregulated selection or consumption of food, alcohol or tobacco.

Data Collection and Analysis

We applied standard Cochrane methods to select eligible studies for inclusion and to collect data and assess risk of bias. We calculated study-level effect sizes as standardised mean differences (SMDs) between comparison groups, measured as quantities selected or consumed. We combined these results using random-effects meta-analysis models to estimate summary effect sizes (SMDs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)) for each outcome for size and shape comparisons. We rated the overall quality of evidence using the GRADE system. Finally, we used meta-regression analysis to investigate statistical associations between summary effect sizes and variant study, intervention or participant characteristics.

Main Results

The current version of this review includes 72 studies, published between 1978 and July 2013, assessed as being at overall unclear or high risk of bias with respect to selection and consumption outcomes. Ninety-six per cent of included studies (69/72) manipulated food products and 4% (3/72) manipulated cigarettes. No included studies manipulated alcohol products. Forty-nine per cent (35/72) manipulated portion size, 14% (10/72) package size and 21% (15/72) tableware size or shape. More studies investigated effects among adults (76% (55/72)) than children and all studies were conducted in high-income countries - predominantly in the USA (81% (58/72)). Sources of funding were reported for the majority of studies, with no evidence of funding by agencies with possible commercial interests in their results.A meta-analysis of 86 independent comparisons from 58 studies (6603 participants) found a small to moderate effect of portion, package, individual unit or tableware size on consumption of food (SMD 0.38, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.46), providing moderate quality evidence that exposure to larger sizes increased quantities of food consumed among children (SMD 0.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.31) and adults (SMD 0.46, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.52). The size of this effect suggests that, if sustained reductions in exposure to larger-sized food portions, packages and tableware could be achieved across the whole diet, this could reduce average daily energy consumed from food by between 144 and 228 kcal (8.5% to 13.5% from a baseline of 1689 kcal) among UK children and adults. A meta-analysis of six independent comparisons from three studies (108 participants) found low quality evidence for no difference in the effect of cigarette length on consumption (SMD 0.25, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.65).One included study (50 participants) estimated a large effect on consumption of exposure to differently shaped tableware (SMD 1.17, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.78), rated as very low quality evidence that exposure to shorter, wider bottles (versus taller, narrower bottles) increased quantities of water consumed by young adult participants.A meta-analysis of 13 independent comparisons from 10 studies (1164 participants) found a small to moderate effect of portion or tableware size on selection of food (SMD 0.42, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.59), rated as moderate quality evidence that exposure to larger sizes increased the quantities of food people selected for subsequent consumption. This effect was present among adults (SMD 0.55, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.75) but not children (SMD 0.14, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.34).In addition, a meta-analysis of three independent comparisons from three studies (232 participants) found a very large effect of exposure to differently shaped tableware on selection of non-alcoholic beverages (SMD 1.47, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.43), rated as low quality evidence that exposure to shorter, wider (versus taller, narrower) glasses or bottles increased the quantities selected for subsequent consumption among adults (SMD 2.31, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.83) and children (SMD 1.03, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.65).

Authors' Conclusions

This review found that people consistently consume more food and drink when offered larger-sized portions, packages or tableware than when offered smaller-sized versions. This suggests that policies and practices that successfully reduce the size, availability and appeal of larger-sized portions, packages, individual units and tableware can contribute to meaningful reductions in the quantities of food (including non-alcoholic beverages) people select and consume in the immediate and short term. However, it is uncertain whether reducing portions at the smaller end of the size range can be as effective in reducing food consumption as reductions at the larger end of the range. We are unable to highlight clear implications for tobacco or alcohol policy due to identified gaps in the current evidence base.

### A hypergraph model shows the carbon reduction potential of effective space use in housing [^8f19f3ce]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Hypergraphs allow the characterization and comparison of floor plans

To show the spatial analysis potential of the hypergraph framework, we created a dataset of residential floor plans from around the globe (see “Methods”, Residential building floor plan repository). In order to characterize differences between cities, we compared a representative subset of floor plans from three different cities: Zurich, New York, and Singapore. Contrary to explicit representations with Euclidean geometry or pixel-based representations, the hypergraph encodes relative spatial relationships in addition to geometric properties. This allows the mapping of spatial and typological similarities between floor plans that have different boundary conditions. Based on the number of rooms, subdivision graphs have a variety of sizes which require comparison functions to work with matrices of different dimensions. For a comparison of different hypergraphs, we compare the subdivision matrix (derived from the spatial subdivision graph) separately from the access matrix (derived from the room access graph).

We can describe the overall configuration and complexity of a hypergraph through the number and degree of access and subdivision edges, normalized by the number of rooms. Using a principal component analysis (PCA) of key attributes (see Supplementary Fig. 9), we can demonstrate that the hypergraph method can be used to distinguish and group similar floor plans according to size and occupancy, as well as compactness (Fig. 3a). Hypergraphs with lower graph complexity, corresponding to smaller size and occupancy, are grouped in the left around the x -axis, while more complex configurations are grouped towards the right. This creates opportunities to quantify spatial differences of apartments across cities, such as simpler spatial properties of apartments in New York, when compared to small-scale, more complex floor plans with higher hypergraph subdivisions in Singapore. The hypergraph allows us to show and encapsulate architectural differences and investigate spatial configurations that are encoded in local architectural practices, prevalent construction techniques, building codes, and climate.

### Packaging and high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of amoxicillin capsules from nablus, palestine [^78ed159f]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

The global rise in antibiotic consumption, along with the prevalence of substandard and falsified (SF) antibiotics, raises concerns about the quality of these important medicines. Additionally, the accessibility of antibiotics without a prescription and insufficient regulatory oversight in many lower- to middle-income countries exacerbate the issue. In particular, there is limited published research on antibiotic quality testing in the Middle East, and more specifically in Palestine. In this study, covert shoppers collected 59 samples of amoxicillin capsules with dosages of 500 mg from Nablus, Palestine, during August 2022. None of the pharmacies or clinics visited requested a prescription from the covert shoppers, despite the fact that all the boxes, when boxes were provided, were labeled as prescription-only medicines. Five different brands, representing 15 unique lot numbers, were collected from 31 locations. All capsules were packaged in their original blister packs, with 10.2% of those packs torn and 27.1% of the dosage forms having visible powder outside the capsule. All of the blister packs were clearly labeled with the lot number, expiry date, brand name, active pharmaceutical ingredient name, dosage, and manufacturer. The samples were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography according to a modified United States Pharmacopeia method. The results indicated that all samples met the standard of containing 90-120% of the stated dose of amoxicillin, with an average dosage and standard deviation of 488 mg and 25 mg, respectively. This SF rate is much lower than that found in most published studies of antibiotics in the Middle East.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Suggested dosages are presented in the therapy guide. Because of the low viscosity of the vehicle, Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate Injection, USP may be administered with a small gauge needle. Care should be taken to inject the preparation deeply into the upper outer quadrant of the gluteal muscle following the usual precautions for intramuscular injection. Since the 250 mg potency provides a high concentration in a small volume, particular care should be observed to administer the full dose.

Note: Use of a wet needle or syringe may cause the solution to become cloudy; however, this does not affect the potency of the material.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

Protect from light. Store vial in its box. Store upright.

Discard any unused product within 5 weeks after first use.

### Energy use and life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of drones for commercial package delivery [^2914ebfa]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

More generally, the problem of covering a defined area with the minimum number of equally sized circles has been explored for a variety of applications, including placement of fire sensors and cellular telephone towers. The solution depends on the boundary shape and relative size of the circles and boundary. Square and hexagonal packings are each optimal in certain circumstances, however hexagonal packing tends to be best over larger areas. Li et al. provide a formula to calculate the minimum number of nodes required to cover a square area with hexagonal packing. The results for an area 16 km on a side (representing a medium-sized city) and varying drone range are shown in Supplementary Fig. 7. We see that the number of required nodes drops quickly with improvements in range from current technology. For example, doubling the range from 3.5 to 7 km decreases the number of nodes by a factor of 3.5. This illustrates the strong economic and environmental incentive to increase the range of the drones, if they are to be deployed from local warehouses. In our base case, we assume drone and van pathways require twice as much warehouse space (and energy) than conventional truck pathways. For our best case, we assume no difference in warehouse energy, and for our worst case, we assume drones and vans will need four times as much warehouse energy.

Overall, we find that a metropolitan area currently served by one regional distribution center could easily require dozens of new local warehouses to achieve the on-demand delivery model proposed for drones. In our base case scenario, we assume that the local warehouses constitute a new and additional stage in the logistics system and that the total storage space in local warehouses is comparable to the space in the distribution center that serves them. Conceivably, a retailer selling a high volume of a small number of products could bypass the regional distribution center and stock local warehouses directly from suppliers. This would reduce the impact of the new local warehouses. On the other hand, a retailer stocking a large number of distinct products might have to replicate its inventory many times to make the products available at each local warehouse.

### A critical edge number revealed for phase stabilities of two-dimensional ball-stick polygons [^e0bb92f5]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The enthalpy-limited case was studied by simulating various interactive point systems – and performing experiments with confined monolayer colloidal spheres. It has been shown that the melting scenario can be tuned by varying the interaction parameters. One of the general conclusions is that there can exist different melting scenarios in the same system at different densities, which has been found in different interactive point-like particles and polygons composed of attractive Lennard-Jones (L-J) beads,,.

Only in recent years did researchers pay attention to more realistic interactive polygons considering both interaction and shape, which leads to qualitatively different phase behaviors. The simulations on L-J beads polygons(square, pentagon, and hexagon) reveal that a wide solid-liquid coexistence region similar to the L-J point system emerges at low temperatures, while the melting scenario of corresponding hard polygon is followed at high temperatures. Different melting scenarios under various thermal conditions provide a basic understanding on the thermodynamic competition between two factors: Enthalpy plays a major role at low temperatures/pressures while entropy is dominant at high temperatures/pressures. Experiments on millimeter-sized polygons (triangle and square) with isotropic magnetic repulsionexhibit crystalline structures incompatible with the symmetry of monomer shape, e.g. the appearance of the triangular lattice structure for the square system, which results from the confliction between the isotropic interaction and the anisotropic shape.

Discussion

Summary of main results

Results of the search

We identified 14,488 unique records, and assessed 1030 full texts for eligibility. We found 58 studies meeting our inclusion criteria, including 22 RCTs, 3 NRCTs, 14 CBA studies, and 19 ITS studies, with a total of 1,180,096 participants. The median length of follow‐up was 10 months. The studies included children, teenagers and adults, and were implemented in a variety of settings, including schools, retailing and food service establishments. We judged most studies to be at high or unclear risk of bias in at least one domain, and most studies used non‐randomised designs. The studies examine a broad range of interventions, and we present results for these separately. Effects on direct and indirect measures of SSB intake are summarised in Table 1 and in the effects direction plot shown in Figure 8.

Labelling interventions

We found moderate‐certainty evidence from two ITS studies that traffic‐light labelling in worksite cafeterias and vending machines is associated with decreased SSB sales (Boelsen‐Robinson 2017 ; Hartigan 2017). We also found low‐certainty evidence from one ITS and one CBA study that nutritional rating score shelf‐labels in supermarkets are associated with decreased SSB sales (Cawley 2015 ; Hobin 2017). We found low‐certainty evidence from one ITS study that emoticon labelling in school cafeterias is associated with decreased sales of sugar‐sweetened milk (Siegel 2016a). One controlled ITS and two CBA studies examined the effects of menu‐board calorie labelling in chain restaurants and cafés on mean beverage calories per transaction, with variable direction of reported effects (Bollinger 2011 ; Elbel 2013 ; Finkelstein 2011). Reported effects on total sales and revenue varied (Boelsen‐Robinson 2017 ; Bollinger 2011 ; Cawley 2015 ; Hartigan 2017 ; Hobin 2017).

A REMINDER FOR THOSE ON 28-DAY PACKS

If you forget any of the 7 white “reminder” pills in Week 4: THROW AWAY the pills you missed. Keep taking 1 pill each day until the pack is empty. You do not need a back-up method.

FINALLY, IF YOU ARE STILL NOT SURE WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE PILLS YOU HAVE MISSED:

Use a BACK-UP METHOD anytime you have sex.

KEEP TAKING ONE “ACTIVE” PILL EACH DAY until you can reach your healthcare professional.

How to Use the Blister Cards for the 21 Tablets

The blister pack comes to you set up for Sunday Start. If your healthcare professional has instructed you to start pill-taking on the SUNDAY after your menstrual period has begun, or if your period begins on Sunday you will take your first pill that very same day. Start with the Sunday pill in row #1 . After the Saturday pill has been taken, begin taking the pills in row #2, and so on, until all 21 pills have been taken. You will then take no pills for one week (seven days).
If you start pill-taking on a day other than SUNDAY, peel the attached sticker by selecting the day of the week you plan to start. Place the sticker over the pre-printed days of the week and make sure it lines up with the pills. This sticker will help to remind you to take your pill every day. Take the yellow pill which corresponds to the day in row #1 for the 1/35 day regimen of the first pack during the first 24 hours of your period.
After the last (Saturday) pill in row #3 has been taken, if any remain in the first row, complete your 21-pill schedule by taking one pill daily starting with Sunday in row #1 until all the pills have been taken.
When you start taking the pill for the first time, use an additional method of protection until you have taken your first 7 pills.
Your tablet dispenser consists of three parts, the foil pouch, wallet, and a blister pack containing 21 individually sealed pills. Note that the pills are arranged in three numbered rows of 7 pills each with the days of the week printed above them. All 21 pills are “active” birth control pills.
You must take your pills in order, one pill each day at intervals of 24 hours. To remove a pill, push down on the pill with your thumb and forefinger so that the pill releases through the back of the dispenser. See diagram below:
Proceed taking one pill each day until all pills have been taken.
After you have taken your last pill, wait for 7 days. During this time your period should begin.
On the eighth day, start a new pack of pills even if your period is not yet over.

Action levels for lead—current action levels identified by HUD and EPA define thresholds for lead in paint, dust, and soil. For paint, lab analysis thresholds are 5,000 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) or 5,000 parts per million (ppm) 0.5% lead by weight, and x-ray fluorescence is 1 milligram per square centimeter (mg/cm^2). For dust, floors are 40 micrograms per square foot (μg/ft^2); window sills are 250 μg/ft^2 and window troughs are 400 μg/ft^2 (clearance only). For soil, high-contact bare play areas are 400 ppm and other yard areas are 1,200 ppm. Lead is considered a potential hazard if above the following levels, but can be a hazard at lower levels if improperly handled.

Smoking status

Pack years were calculated using eight variables from the CLSA. Participants who responded negatively to “Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your life? (about 4 - 5 packs)” were categorized as “Never Smoked”. Participants who were current smokers were asked “For how many total years have you smoked daily?” and “During the total years that you have smoked daily, about how many cigarettes per day have you usually smoked? (If your smoking pattern has changed over the years, make your best guess of the average number of cigarettes you have smoked per day.)” The number of cigarettes smoked per day was recorded in categories of 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, 21–25, and 26+ cigarettes. The midpoint of each of category was used to determine the number of cigarettes smoked per day with the exception of 26+ cigarettes in which case an exact number was recorded. Similar questions were asked to former daily smokers.

Pack years was calculated as: [(number of cigarettes smoked per day/20 cigarettes per pack) x number of years smoked]. Pack years was then categorized into Never Smoked, < 10 pack years, and 10 or more pack years. Participants who were never daily smokers but had smoked more than 100 lifetime cigarettes were included in the < 10 pack years category.

### The silent salesman: an observational study of personal tobacco pack display at outdoor caféstrips in Australia [^9cafc8c8]. Tobacco Control (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to determine the relative frequency and nature of personal display of cigarette packs by smokers in two Australian cities where 30% front-of-pack and 90% back-of-pack health warnings have been used since 2006 and comprehensive tobacco marketing restrictions apply.

Methods

An observational study counted patrons, active smokers and tobacco packs at cafés, restaurants and bars with outdoor seating. Pack orientation and use of cigarette cases were also noted.

Results

Overall, 18954 patrons, 1576 active smokers and 2153 packs were observed, meaning that one out of every 12.0 patrons was actively smoking, and one of every 8.8 patrons displayed a pack. Packs were more frequently observed in lower socio-economic neighbourhoods, reflecting the higher prevalence of smoking in those regions. Packs were displayed less often in venues where children were present, suggesting a greater tendency not to smoke around children. Most packs (81.4%) were oriented face-up, permitting prominent brand display. Only 1.5% of observed packs were cigarette cases, and 4.2% of packs were concealed by another item, such as a phone or wallet.

Conclusions

Tobacco packs are frequently seen on table-tops in café strips, providing many opportunities for other patrons and passers-by to be incidentally exposed to cigarette brand names and imagery. Use of cigarette cases is rare, suggesting that smokers eventually habituate to pictorial warnings on branded packs and/or find repeated decanting of each newly purchased branded pack into a case to be inconvenient.

### The structural origin of the hard-sphere glass transition in granular packing [^1ab35184]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

X-ray microtomography

We use microtomography to obtain the 3D packing structures prepared by tapping, hopper deposition and flow pulse protocols. These three protocols can cover a wide range of Φ from 0.572 to 0.634. Using micro-tomography, we also investigate the correlation between dynamics and structure by tracking the displacements of all particles and the corresponding structural evolution of the packing for a consecutive number of tapping steps in the tapping experiment.

In the tapping protocol, we fill a 9-mm ID acrylic cylindrical container with particles to ∼1 cm in height, and we use an electromagnetic exciter to tap the container. Packing with different Φ ranging from 0.618 to 0.634 is obtained by varying the tapping intensity Γ, which is measured by an accelerometer as the ratio between the peak-to-peak acceleration and the gravitational acceleration. The tapping consists of a single cycle of 60-Hz sine wave spaced with 0.5 s intervals to allow the system to relax completely. A total of 1,000 taps are applied on each packing with different Γ to reach steady state. In the hopper deposition protocol, we first place a hopper with its outlet touching the base of the cylindrical container, and fill the hopper with particles. The hopper is then slowly lifted up with a step motor to let the particles drain gradually from the outlet. The packing formed is cylindrical at the bottom, with a conical top. The Φ prepared by this protocol is 0.598. In the flow pulse protocol, the particles are placed in an acrylic cylindrical tube filled with water. The tube is sealed with a fine copper mesh at the bottom from a water inlet. The packing is prepared by subjecting the particles to a sequence of flow pulses generated from a syringe pump. The particles are allowed to fully settle between pulses. Φ ranging from 0.572 to 0.588 are obtained by varying the flow velocity.

### Nutritional labelling for healthier food or non-alcoholic drink purchasing and consumption [^bfa00b30]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Purchasing

There were 11 purchasing studies in real‐world settings.

Bergen 2006 assessed the impact of labelling on drinks purchased from vending machines by measuring the mean number of low‐energy soft drinks sold weekly over a nine‐week period (two‐week baseline period, five‐week intervention period, and two‐week postintervention period).

Balasubramanian 2002 assessed the impact of labelling on 'light' entrées and juices purchased from a grocery store by measuring sales transactions (i.e. the percentage of labelled products bought relative to other products bought) each week over a seven‐year period.

Nine studies assessed the impact of labelling on food or drinks purchased in restaurants, cafeterias or coffee shops. Studies measured the outcome using the mean energy content of items purchased at each meal over a period of time (2 weeks: Ellison 2013 ; 4 weeks: VanEpps 2016 ; 41 days: Chu 2009 ; 2 months: Holmes 2013 ; 19 weeks: Ellison 2014a), mean weekly energy sales of 45 labelled food items for 12 weeks (Cioffi 2015), the proportion of high‐calorie purchases over a six‐week period (as a percentage of total drinks or snacks sold) (Allan 2015); mean energy of food and drinks bought per sales transaction over 14 months (Bollinger 2011), or the probability of purchasing low‐energy items from three different food categories (vegetables, salads, entrées) during an 18‐week period (Dubbert 1984).

Consumption

Seventeen studies assessed the impact of labelling on food or drink consumed in artificial or laboratory settings. In 14 of these studies, the outcome was mean energy consumed during a snack, a single meal, or across multiple meals (Crockett 2014 ; Ebneter 2013 ; Girz 2012 ‐ study 1 ; Girz 2012 ‐ study 2 ; Girz ongoing ; Hammond 2013 ; Harnack 2008a ; James 2015 ; Kral 2002 ; Platkin 2014 ; Roberto 2010 ; Temple 2010 ; Wansink 2006 ‐ study 1 ; Wansink 2006 ‐ study 3). Of the three remaining studies, two measured mean grams of food consumed (Cavanagh 2014 ; Roberto 2012), and one measured mean volume of a drink consumed (Vermeer 2011).

Further details of each study are reported in the table of Characteristics of included studies.

### Computer-aided discovery of a metal-organic framework with superior oxygen uptake [^f799407f]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Fig. 4 
Structure–property relationships for oxygen storage in MOFs. Oxygen volumetric and gravimetric deliverable capacity is plotted vs. the largest cavity diameter (LCD) and void fraction (V f) for 2,932 MOF structures at a 30 bar, b 80 bar, c 140 bar and d 200 bar storage pressures and 298 K. The release pressure is kept fixed at 5 bar for all storage pressures. The dashed lines mark the amount of oxygen adsobed in an empty tank. Each point in the graph represents a different structure. The data points are color coded and sized according to V f and LCD, respectively

The “sweet spot” combining different geometrical properties with optimum uptake or deliverable capacity changes as the storage pressure increases from 30 to 200 bar. For example, top volumetric uptake at 140 bar (i.e. higher than 250 cm 3 (STP) cm –3) is obtained for MOFs with void fractions between 0.45 and 0.82, but in this range of void fractions, the volumetric uptake can be as low as 125 cm 3 (STP) cm –3 (Supplementary Fig. 9). To find what descriptors are more important, Fig. 5 compares the role of different MOF properties for the top 1% of structures – in terms of volumetric deliverable capacity – at 30, 80, 140 and 200 bar storage pressure. Supplementary Table 2 also highlights the first quartile, third quartile, and interquartile range (IQR) values for the top materials geometric properties. The general trend shows that the values of optimal LCDs, void fractions and surface areas increase, while density decreases, with the storage pressure; in general, larger pore sizes translate into higher void fractions and surface areas, as well as lower densities. The variation of individual geometric properties spread in the IQR (i.e. the box height) and how the data is skewed is particularly interesting. Remarkably, the interquartile height of LCD increases with the storage pressure, whereas those for void fraction and surface area decrease, with not so significant variations for density. This indicates the importance of optimal values of LCD at low storage pressure, and void fraction and surface area at high storage pressure. Overall, at 30 bar, optimal MOFs feature a narrow range for optimal pore size (i.e. LCD: 7.0–8.3 Å), but broader for void fraction (0.5–0.7) and surface area (1500–2600 m 2 g –1); see Supplementary Table 2. As the storage pressure increases to 200 bar, these sweet spots change towards larger values, while the range of optimal values for LCD is now broader (LCD: 9.8–14.8 Å), but much narrower for void fractions (0.78–0.82) and surface area (3500–3700 m 2 g –1). This clearly indicates that top materials at a certain storage pressure do not necessarily keep the same ranking as the storage pressure changes. For example, the top structures at 30 bar, HAFQOW and EHALOP, are ranked 280 th and 278 th, respectively, at 140 bar.

### PICS / AEPC / APPCS / CSANZ / SCAI / SOLACI: expert consensus statement on cardiac Catheterization for pediatric patients and adults with congenital heart Disease [^3c6ccf78]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric and congenital cardiac catheterization—dose reduction principles and equipment calibration emphasize justification, ALARA, and system configuration: Dose management centers around the principles of justification and optimization, and “The procedure should be justified for each patient,” with the understanding that “there is no dose threshold below which cancer risk from radiation is zero,” so that radiation exposure is always maintained “As Low As Reasonably Achievable.” Radiation dose delivery is optimized by “(1) equipment quality and calibration, (2) equipment operating protocols, and (3) operator conduct,” and “Total dose delivered to the patient is proportional to the product of the dose per frame and the total number of frames during the study,” where dose per frame and number of frames depend on equipment, settings, patient size, frame rate, and beam-on time. For image quality, “a fine balance between image quality and dose must be achieved such that the lowest acceptable image quality is used that will not compromise diagnosis and/or treatment,” since poor-quality images that prolong procedures do not reduce overall dose. Implementation begins at installation since “Out of the box” systems may be adult-optimized; optimization “should involve close collaboration among interventional cardiologists, cath lab staff, the vendor’s design engineers, and qualified medical physicists,” and “A qualified medical physicist should check the equipment calibration periodically,” with verification that “the x-ray system is working as expected.”

Intravenous Administration

For intravenous administration, the usual volume of diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) is 50 to 100 mL for adult doses.  For pediatric patients, the volume of diluent should be proportionately less than that for adults.  The diluted solution usually should be infused over a period of 20 to 60 minutes.  Infusion periods of less than 20 minutes are not recommended because peak serum levels may exceed 12 mcg/mL (see WARNINGS box).

Tobramycin injection should not be physically premixed with other drugs but should be administered separately according to the recommended dose and route.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^19e598f4]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Combined oral contraceptives (COCs)—dispensing quantity guidance specifies that at the initial and return visits, providers should provide or prescribe up to a 1-year supply of COCs (e.g., 13 28-day pill packs) based on the patient’s preferences and anticipated use, and a patient should be able to obtain COCs easily in the amount and at the time they need them. The comments and evidence summarize that the more pill packs provided up to 13 cycles, the higher the continuation rates; restricting the number of pill packs distributed or prescribed can be a barrier for patients who want to continue COC use and might increase risk for pregnancy; and providing a greater number of pill packs was associated with increased continuation, with studies comparing one versus 12 packs, one versus 12 or 13 packs, or three versus seven packs finding increased continuation among women provided with more packs. One study found no difference when one and then three packs were provided versus four packs all at once; a greater number of pill packs was associated with fewer pregnancy tests, fewer pregnancies, and lower cost per client, but 13 packs versus three packs was associated with increased pill wastage in one study (Level of evidence: I to II-2, fair, direct).

### Modeling the impact of the variation in peripheral nerve anatomy on stimulation [^a1e0422e]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

where p is the packing fraction (ratio of total fiber cross-sectional area to fascicle area), and A is the total cross-section area of a fascicle.

Although the conductivity of myelin is very low compared to conductivity values of the axon and endoneurium, its total cross-sectional area could be significant, especially for higher packing fractions. Since the effective conductivity calculation (Equation (4)) considers the product of myelin conductivity and its cross-sectional area, myelin’s contribution to the effective fascicle conductivity could be considerable.

Effective Radial Conductivity

The effective radial conductivity is computed through finite element analysis (FEA) simulations. Two simulations are performed for evaluation of effective radial conductivity. The first simulation considers an infinitely long box containing uniformly distributed nerve fibers (Figure 3) to model a nerve fascicle for a given packing fraction. The second simulation considers a homogeneous pseudo material instead of the nerve fibers in the same fascicle. One volt potential difference is applied across opposite sides of the box, and the remaining two sides are insulated.

Figure 3 
A square cross-section of Aα nerve fibers considered for computing effective radial conductivity – packing fraction is considered to be 0.7.

The total current flowing through the box is measured using FEA simulations. More details about the FEA simulations are provided in the section Stimulation of a peripheral nerve. The conductivity of the pseudo material, in the second simulation, which matches the total current flowing through the box in the first simulation, is the effective radial conductivity for that packing fraction. No changes in effective radial conductivity were observed with varying fiber diameters. The cross-sectional area of fibers was computed using the mean diameter values listed in Table 1.

### The advertised price of cigarette packs in retail outlets across Australia before and after the implementation of plain packaging: a repeated measures observational study [^2837d381]. Tobacco Control (2015). Low credibility.

Store sample and selection

In May 2012, stores were selected from 16 sampling areas within Australia's two largest cities—Melbourne and Sydney—and eight areas in each of the cities of Adelaide and Perth. Sampling areas were selected by stratifying all postcodes within the metropolitan boundaries of each city into four SES categories using the Socioeconomic Indices for Areas 2011 Index of Relative Disadvantage,then randomly selecting equal numbers of postcodes from each SES category in each city. Each of these postcodes formed the primary postcode of that sampling area. For efficiency during store selection, a nearby secondary postcode was selected for each area, matched by SES category. Therefore, each sampling area was comprised of two postcodes.

Maps of each sampling area identifying potentially useful shopping strips and centres were created. Fieldworkers were instructed to visit the largest shopping strip in the primary postcode and, using a rigorous set of walking rules, sample all potentially eligible stores until either their store quotas were met or they had sampled the entire shopping strip. In the latter situation, the second largest shopping area in the primary postcode was then sampled, and so on. If all shopping strips were exhausted in the primary postcode, the sampling procedure was continued in the secondary postcode. Potentially eligible stores were:
Supermarkets: large grocery chains;
Convenience stores: small independent supermarkets and branded chain convenience stores with a broad range of products and extended opening hours;
Small mixed-businesses: milk bars (Melbourne), delis (Adelaide and Perth), corner stores and general stores;
Petrol stations: any store that sold petrol, including those branded as convenience stores or supermarket chains;
Newsagents/lottery outlets: stores that sold newspapers, magazines and stationery as their primary business and/or lottery tickets and services.

Quotas were set at nine stores per area, including one of each store type in every area wherever possible. We visited a total of 796 stores, of which a total of 375 (47.1%) did not meet the eligibility criteria in that they did not sell tobacco (n=129, 16.2%), had no visible price board (n=225, 28.3%), or displayed fewer than three single cigarette pack prices (n=21, 2.6%), leaving 421 stores in the sample.

### The sands of time run faster near the end [^544438d2]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

We now fit equation (5) to the three open surge experiments in Fig. 1a, by adjusting b separately for each data set but adjusting one value of a andsimultaneously for all. The quality of the fits is good, and the values of the fitting parameters make sense: First, the reference flow rateoverlaps with the result from the flow-control experiments. Second, the value of a translates directly to a driving pressure of Δ P = aη /(αKd 2 D)=5±3 Pa. This is on the order of the Bernoulli pressure based on the single-grain terminal falling speed, but is even closer to, whereis the speed of the stream of discharged grains (Supplementary Table 1). Physically, the fluid pressure at the outlet is reduced due to some combination of grain dilation and fluid flow beneath the hopper, both of which are driven by gravity and hence might be expected to scale with.

Next, we repeat the surge experiments for the smaller beads and three hole and hopper sizes. Fitting values for the parameter b are plotted in Fig. 4a versus D 2 / A. As expected from equations (4) and (5), the results decrease linearly with D 2 / A, and do not depend on grain size. The displayed line fit has slope β =4.0±0.2 and intercept b o =4 βγ / π =0.200±0.004; these combine to give γ =0.04±0.01. The height of the region where the permeation flow becomes constricted is thus, as expected. And, the value of γ is smaller than one, also as expected, because the grain density decreases in the exit region and because the true interstitial flow also enters through the sidewalls of the imagined cylinder.

### Polarisome scaffolder spa2-mediated macromolecular condensation of aip5 for actin polymerization [^f74b458c]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Fluorescent imaging analysis

To analyze the signal intensity of Aip5-GFP at the presumptive bud site, the average Z -projection images were created from live cell imaging data by ImageJ. WT cells without florescence protein tagging were imaged at the same conditions to calculate the auto-florescence signal from the cytosol. The segmented line tool was used to draw a rectangular box with a width of 6 pixels and a length of 33 pixels at the bud tip perpendicular to the mother–daughter axis. The average intensity of the box was measured and termed as bud tip (T) signal intensity. The same size of the box was used in measuring the signal intensity of the cell cytosol region (C). The background region and auto-florescence signal from cytosol was measured in the same size box and termed as (B). The relative bud tip signal intensity to cytosol signal intensity (R) was calculated as R = (T − B)/(C − B). The relative intensity profile R was classified into three categories: (1) no bud tip localization when R = 1; (2) a weak bud tip localization when 1 < R ≤ 1.5; and (3) a strong bud tip localization when R > 1.5.

Living cell Abp140-3XGFP was imaged by z -axis scanning by wide-field microscope ×100 objective lens (NA 1.4), with a step size of 250 nm, which was close to the calculated ideal Nyquist Rate. Image stacks were applied to the Huygens Essential deconvolution software (Scientific Volume Imaging, Netherlands) batch processing mode; a default calculation parameter was applied for fluorescence images to eliminate background signal and improve quality. The deconvoluted whole Z -scan images of Abp140-3XGFP were then subjected to the Imaris software version 8.0 (Bitplane, USA) and analyzed by FilamentTracer module to calculate the number, length, and total intensity of Abp140-labeled actin cables. The individual filament was tracked through the auto-tracked function with a threshold of 0.1 and filament thickness <0.5 µm. To analyze the lifetime of actin patches, time-lapse movies of Abp1-RFP were subjected to Huygens deconvolution using XYZT mode with a threshold of 0.1 and 10 calculations in the MLE algorithm. Kymographs were generated from movies of mother cells to measure the Abp1-RFP lifetime that reflects the endocytosis efficiency.

### Entropy-driven denaturation enables sustainable protein regeneration through rapid gel-solid transition [^09f37df3]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

General simulation setup

All the molecular dynamics simulations were conducted with NAMD 2.14software and analyzed and visualized with VMD 1.9.3, unless otherwise denoted. Amber ff14SB force fieldwere used for atomistic protein simulation, combined with TIP3P water modelfor explicit solvation and Li/Merz ion parametersfor monovalent ions. All initial configurations of simulation box were prepared using tLEaP program, followed by minimization, heating, constant pressure (NPT) equilibration, and constant volume (NVT) equilibration. All the production simulations were run under constant particle number, constant volume, and constant temperature (i.e. canonical ensemble (NVT)). Periodic boundary condition was applied to prevent the boundary effect. Langevin thermostat with damping coefficient of 1 ps -1 was used to control simulation temperature as 298 K, without coupling hydrogen atoms. Electrostatic and van der Waals interactions were cut off beyond 12 Å. Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method was employed to deal with long-range electrostatic interactions. Rigid bond constraints between hydrogen and any other atoms were applied through SHAKE/RATTLE algorithm. The integration time step was set as 2 fs with short-range nonbonded forces updated every 2 fs and long-range electrostatic forces updated every 4 fs. Software and models are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.

Initial configuration preparation and equilibration

To ensure that total number of ions and water molecules are correctly determined for all salts and concentrations, we first decided the simulation box sizes and thus ion numbers. All the simulation boxes were fixed to the size with three dimensions around 50 Å. Water molecules were initially placed using tLEaP program, the numbers of which were then adjusted according to volume changes after 100 ps minimization, 200 ps heating, and 2 ns constant pressure (NPT) equilibration. After the water molecule number corrections, another round of 100 ps minimization, 200 ps heating, 2 ns constant pressure (NPT) equilibration, plus 2 ns constant volume (NVT) equilibration, were conducted to ensure the correct setup and complete equilibration of simulation systems.

### CHARMM-GUI multicomponent assembler for modeling and simulation of complex multicomponent systems [^246dc42e]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

STEP 1 – Read structures and FFs

Because CHARMM-GUI uses CHARMM for model building and manipulation, it is required to provide molecular structures in both CHARMM protein structure file (PSF) and coordinate (CRD) formats. Additionally, for periodic (nanomaterial) structures with image bonds (between the primary system and the PBC systems), listing the bonds in a CHARMM-formatted image PSF file is necessary. Molecules containing residues already present in the CHARMM and INTERFACE FFs are recognized automatically, but any additional residue topologies and FFs must be provided in CHARMM’s residue topology file (RTF) and parameter (PRM) formats with unique identifiers that do not conflict with the existing FFs. Note that these files can be obtained from other CHARMM-GUI modules such as PDB Reader & Modeler, Glycan Reader & Modeler, Ligand Reader & Modeler, Nanomaterial Modeler, and Polymer Builder.

For each uploaded component, MCA uses CHARMM internal functions to determine the molecular dimensions, volume, solvent-accessible volume, mass, charge, number of residues, and radius of gyration. To facilitate membrane building, the uploaded coordinates are used to determine the volume and center of mass of the molecular regions that would be located within, above, and below a membrane centered at Z = 0 with a hydrophobic thickness of 24 Å. The component’s dimensions are calculated as its bounding box when the component’s primary, secondary, and tertiary axes are aligned with the X, Y, and Z axes, respectively. The component’s length is determined as the maximum distance between any two atoms within the structure. This value is needed to estimate the minimum box size that prevents any component from interacting with its own PBC images. The molecular volume is calculated by polling coordinates using a grid spacing of 0.5 Å within any atom’s van der Waals radius, with a maximum probe range of 6 Å, and counting the empty holes within a molecule toward its volume. For solvent-accessible volume, the procedure is repeated with atomic radii increased by 1.4 Å, corresponding to the water radius.

### Body plethysmography – its principles and clinical use [^d74b88a4]. Respiratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Body plethysmography allows to assess functional residual capacity (FRC(pleth)) and specific airway resistance (sRaw) as primary measures. In combination with deep expirations and inspirations, total lung capacity (TLC) and residual volume (RV) can be determined. Airway resistance (Raw) is calculated as the ratio of sRaw to FRC(pleth). Raw is a measure of airway obstruction and indicates the alveolar pressure needed to establish a flow rate of 1 L s(-1). In contrast, sRaw can be interpreted as the work to be performed by volume displacement to establish this flow rate. These measures represent different functional aspects and should both be considered. The measurement relies on the fact that generation of airflow needs generation of pressure. Pressure generation means that a mass of air is compressed or decompressed relative to its equilibrium volume. This difference is called "shift volume". As the body box is sealed and has rigid walls, its free volume experiences the same, mirror image-like shift volume as the lung. This shift volume can be measured via the variation of box pressure. The relationship between shift volume and alveolar pressure is assessed in a shutter maneuver, by identifying mouth and alveolar pressure under zero-flow conditions. These variables are combined to obtain FRC(pleth), sRaw and Raw. This presentation aims at providing the reader with a thorough and precise but non-technical understanding of the working principle of body plethysmography. It also aims at showing that this method yields significant additional information compared to spirometry and even bears a potential for further development.

### Cigarette brand diversity and price changes during the implementation of plain packaging in the United Kingdom [^9e371398]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Aim

Plain packaging of cigarettes appeared in the United Kingdom in July 2016 and was ubiquitous by May 2017. The change coincided with another legislative change, raising the minimum pack size from 10 to 20 cigarettes. Laws imposing plain packaging on cigarette packs remove another promotional route from tobacco companies, but the effect of such laws on brand diversity, pricing and sales volume is unknown. This study aimed to (1) describe and quantify changes in brand diversity, price segmentation and sales volumes and (2) estimate the association between the introduction of plain cigarette packaging and cigarette pricing in the United Kingdom.

Design

We used a natural experiment design to assess the impact of plain packaging legislation on brand diversity and cigarette prices. The data comprised a sample of 76% of sales of cigarettes in the UK between March 2013 and June 2017.

Setting

United Kingdom.

Measurements

Cigarette prices, number of brands and products and volumes of sales.

Findings

During the period analysed, there was a slight decrease in the number of cigarette brands. There was also an initial increase observed in the number of cigarette products, due mainly to an increase in the number of products in packs of fewer than 20 cigarettes sold before July 2016, which was then followed by a rapid decrease in the number of products that coincided with the implementation of the new legislation. Cigarette sales volumes during this period did not deviate from the preceding secular trend, but prices rose substantially. Regression results showed that price per cigarette, regardless of pack size, was 5.0 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.8-5.3] pence higher in plain than in fully branded packs. For packs of 20 cigarettes, price increases were greater in the lower price quintiles, ranging from 2.6 (95% CI = 2.4-2.7) GBP in the lowest to 0.3 (95% CI = 0.3-0.4) GBP per pack in the highest quintile.

Conclusions

The implementation of standardized packaging legislation in the United Kingdom, which included minimum pack sizes of 20, was associated with significant increases overall in the price of manufactured cigarettes, but no clear deviation in the ongoing downward trend in total volume of cigarette sales.

### Understanding variation in bra cup sizing among leading manufacturers: a current guide for patients and surgeons [^61b8ebbc]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Brassiere (bra) size is commonly used when patients and plastic surgeons discuss breast procedures. Variations in sizing between manufacturers can affect patient-surgeon communication and postoperative satisfaction. This study quantifies bra cup volume across alphanumeric sizes and manufacturers to describe variance and improve preoperative communication for shared decision-making.

Methods

Bras sized 36A-DD from seven manufacturers were fit to a mannequin and filled using custom breast sizers. Sizers were weighed and converted to volume, and statistical differences in cup volume between manufacturers were assessed at each size.

Results

Cup volume varied significantly between manufacturers at all sizes, with larger cup sizes showing greater variance. Standard deviation in mean cup volume (cc), across all manufacturers, was A: 30.9, B: 40.1, C: 62.2, D: 69.7, and DD: 122.8. Calvin Klein and Hanes ran small, while Wacoal ran larger at sizes C-DD. Wacoal was significantly larger than Hanes and Calvin Klein at sizes 36C (P<0.05 and P<0.01) and 36D (P<0.05 and P<0.005), and was significantly larger than Calvin Klein at 36DD (P<0.005). Variation was observed at cup sizes A and B, though individual manufacturer trends were less clear. Soma was significantly larger than Victoria's Secret at size 36A (P<0.005), and Victoria's Secret was significantly larger than Calvin Klein at 36B (P<0.05).

Conclusions

This study provides a reference for surgeons and patients when discussing goal breast size after procedures. These data are especially useful for larger cup sizes, where variation in cup volume is greatest, enabling more accurate communication and greater patient understanding.

### Automatic design of mechanical metamaterial actuators [^a4688563]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Size scaling of the algorithm

We investigate the scaling of the algorithm from an empirical perspective. To do so, we prepare six different lattices of increasing size, starting at N b = 172 bonds and up to N b = 885 bonds. Following the displacement-based protocol, we fix an input displacement of 1% relative to the total side length of the lattice, and a desired output direction perpendicular to the input, as in the example in Fig. 1. We run our algorithm for a total of 10 ⋅ N b accepted MC steps, decreasing the temperature from 0.06 down to 0, followed by 2 ⋅ N b MC steps at zero temperature. We generate 100 different structures for each lattice size, totaling 600 structures. For each structure, we measure its total execution time T and its efficiency η (see Fig. 3).

Fig. 3 
Scaling of the algorithm.

Small gray dots show the raw data over 100 independent simulations. The red line is a linear fit in logarithmic space. The panel shows that the algorithm scales approximately as the cube of the number of bonds. b Boxplot of displacement-based efficiency as a function of number of bonds. The underlying raw data is also shown as black dots. Error bars in boxplots indicate minimum and maximum quartiles, boxes are first and third quartiles. The panel shows that efficiency initially increases with N b to then saturate, but there is great heterogeneity withing a fixed lattice size.

The scaling exponent α is obtained by fitting a liner regression model betweenand. We obtain an estimate of. The efficiency of the obtained configurations increases with N b for the smallest lattice sizes, to then reach a plateau at larger sizes. We notice that the Monte Carlo procedure was designed to scale with N b as well, so the relaxation part of the algorithm would account for the remainingscaling. Although some computational details or the usage of faster CPU equipment could lower the reported execution times, there is an upper bound on the lattice sizes that can be investigated with the present algorithm. Still, our implementation allows us to find efficient structures in less than roughly one day for lattice sizes of around 700 bonds, which is within the range of interest for mechanical metamaterial actuators.

### Tree-rings reveal two strong solar proton events in 7176 and 5259 BCE [^1976636e]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Modeling

To model the carbon cycle an improved carbon box model based on the model of Güttler et al.was used (Supplementary Fig 2). The model of Güttler uses 11 Boxes to simulate the exchange between the global atmosphere biosphere and Oceans. To model the northern and southern hemispheres separately our model was extended to 22 boxes (11 boxes for each hemisphere). The carbon content of each box is distributed according to the respective relative carbon reservoir masses of the corresponding hemisphere. Radiocarbon is produced in the stratosphere and the troposphere of both hemispheres, where 70% is produced in the Stratosphere and 30 % in the Troposphere. The fluxes were adjusted to ensure a correct ∆ 14 C offset between the northern and southern troposphere. Seasonal variability of fluxes was not considered in the model.

The 12 C and 14 C content of each box after a time step is calculated withHereis thecontent of each box in Gt and λ is the decay constant of 14 C. The time step ∆t was chosen to be one month for all the following simulations. The 14 C and 12 C fluxes are given by the following:Hereare the fluxes given in Supplementary Fig. 2. The fluxes are scaled depending on the deviation from the Holocene steady state. The steady state was computed by simulating 200’000 years with the constant production rate. The model does not consider any isotopic fractionation and thus the 14 C fluxes scale just as the 12 C fluxes.

With this a general expression for all boxes at any time can be achieved.The ∆ 14 C of each box for the simulation is calculated by the following expression:Whereare the steady state 12,14 C contents of the northern troposphere.

To get a reasonable start state at a given time the production rate for the whole IntCal13 record has been calculated and the simulated state can be loaded at any time before 1950 CE.

The events were evaluated by generating 1000 realizations of the data distributed with the errors of the measurements. For each realization a Gaussian shaped production spike was fitted and the additional production was extracted by integrating the Gaussian production. Since the energy spectrum of the SEPs is softer than the one of the galactic cosmic rays the excess production of the event was mainly produced in the stratosphere (90%) and only 10% in the troposphere. The errors were estimated by using the widths of the resulting distributions.

### Secukinumab (Cosentyx) [^57fb6f84]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.11     Preparation and Administration of COSENTYX for Intravenous Use

COSENTYX (for intravenous use) must be diluted prior to infusion. Using aseptic technique, prepare COSENTYX (for intravenous use) as follows:

Step 1. Volume Calculation

Calculate the total volume of COSENTYX for intravenous use solution (in mL) required based on the patient’s actual body weight as follows:
Loading dose (6 mg/kg) is 0.24 mL/kg
Maintenance dose (1.75 mg/kg) is 0.07 mL/kg
Use the number of vials based on total volume needed (one vial contains 5 mL of COSENTYX solution).

Step 2. Dilution

Parenteral drug product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if particulates or discolorations are noted.
Follow Table 1 for recommended infusion bag size based on patient's body weight.

From the infusion bag, withdraw and discard a volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, equal to the calculated volume of the COSENTYX solution required for the patient’s dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.6, 2.7)] .
From the vial(s), withdraw the calculated volume (mL) of COSENTYX solution and add slowly into the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP infusion bag. To mix the solution, gently invert the bag to avoid foaming. Do not shake.
Discard unused COSENTYX product in vials because it does not contain preservatives.

### Effect of low-cost kitchen with improved cookstove on birthweight of neonates in shahjadpur, Bangladesh: a cluster-randomised controlled trial [^dff77433]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2024). High credibility.

Sample size calculation

A sample size for cluster RCT had been calculatedto test a reduction of LBW from 37% to 24%,, with 95% CI and 90% power, and 10% intra-cluster correlation. Therefore, we required at least 520 eligible participants from each intervention and control groups (104 clusters with 10 eligible participants from each cluster). To account for potential loss to follow-up due to residential moves (7.5%) and pregnancy loss (5.9%),and unable to measure the birthweight of neonates (10.0%), we increased the sample size by 23.4%, bringing the total to 641 participants in each group. Thus, a minimum of 650 pregnant women was targeted for each intervention and control groups. As these 104 clusters were randomly divided into intervention and control groups and then, we were enrolled all the eligible pregnant women in each cluster, so there was no obvious selection bias, except that the pregnant women in the intervention groups used the model kitchen. As the crude birth rate was 22.6 per 1000 population in Bangladesh,we were able to enrol the required number of pregnant women from 104 clusters.

Data analysis

In this paper, we included the participants who had only singleton neonate (n = 465 in intervention and n = 495 in control groups). We measured birthweight of the neonates within 72 h of the deliveries in the data analysis due to avoid biases related to LBW prevalence. Therefore, the study included the analysis of 960 births that meet the eligibility criteria, which reduced the statistical power to 88%.

Descriptive analysis to compare maternal and neonatal characteristics between the intervention and control groups was done using the survey data module of Stata (version 16.0, Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA) by employing weighted and cluster (n = 104) adjusted analysis techniques. We used principal component analysis to create a household wealth index, which we used as a covariate in these analyses. The assets included durable consumption goods (e.g. table, chair, watch, television, bicycle), housing facilities (e.g. types of toilet, sources of drinking water), housing materials (e.g. types of wall, floor, and roof), and land ownership. The wealth index was categorized into five ordinal categories: least wealthy, less wealthy, wealthy, wealthier, and most wealthy.

### Methodologies for the development of CHEST guidelines and expert panel reports [^e7ef9102]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

CHEST grading framework—dimensions and evidence adjustment are defined explicitly. The CHEST grading system defines the grades based on two key dimensions: (1) the balance of benefits of the proposed action as compared with the possible harms or risks and (2) the methodologic quality of the supporting evidence. Both factors are represented in the overall grade, with the former represented by 1 or 2 and the latter A, B, or C. The methodologic quality is initially based on the hierarchy of study design, but studies can be upgraded or downgraded based on specific criteria (eg, existence of methodologic flaws, directness, precision, consistency of results).

### Cost effective use of satellite packs in neonates: importance of birth weight [^abd63c56]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Blood banks split an adult packed red cell bag (usually 250 ml) into 30 ml bags, making a total of eight neonatal "satellite" packs per donor. These packs are then "allocated"/"committed" to be used to serially transfuse a newborn.

Aim

To study transfusion requirements of premature infants in relation to their birth weight and thereby attempt to rationalise the method of dispensing satellite blood packs.

Method

Data on the distribution of neonatal transfusions with respect to weight were obtained retrospectively from unit A (51 infants, 168 transfusions) and unit B (46 infants, 151 transfusions). These data were used to model the effect of different policies on donor exposure and number of unused packs.

Results

Infants weighing less than 1000 g at birth have significantly higher transfusion requirements than those weighing 1000 g or more (p = 0.001 (unit A), p = 0.004 (unit B)). Our model predicted a significant reduction in donor exposure if eight packs/infant were allocated to those weighing < 1000 g, and a significant cut in the number of unused packs if four satellite packs/infant were allocated to those weighing > or = 1000 g.

Conclusions

It would be safer and cost effective to allocate eight packs/infant to those with birth weights < 1000 g and four packs/infant to those with birth weights > or = 1000 g.

### Engineering and application of a biosensor with focused ligand specificity [^cb7d58cb]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The systems were prepared in a cubical box with 10 Å padding between the protein and closest wall. The box was solvated with water coordinates from spc216. The system was neutralized with Na+ and Cl− ions. The systems were minimized using steepest descent algorithm with a step size of 0.01, a convergence criterion of 1000 kJ mol −1 nm −1 and a maximum number of 50,000 steps. For the minimization, system setup and subsequent MD, the program GROMACSwas used with the AMBER99SB-ILDNforce field and tip3p water model. Following minimization, an NVT (constant number of particles, volume, and temperature) equilibration over 100 ps with cubic periodic boundary conditions, leapfrog Verlet integrator with time steps of 2 fs, holonomic constraints with LINCS iteration of 1 and order 4, and restrained hydrogen bonds was conducted. The cutoffs for short range electrostatics and van der Waals were set to 1 nm. Particle Mesh Ewald was used for long range electrostatics with PME order 4 and a grid spacing of 1.6 Å. Temperature coupling used the velocity rescaling (v-rescale) thermostat at 300 K and coupled the protein to the solvent with a time constant of 0.1 ps. Next, a 100 ps NPT (constant number of particles, pressure, and temperature) simulation followed with the same parameters plus the addition of an isotropic Parrinello–Rahman pressure coupling with time constant of 2 ps at 1 bar pressure, given a compressibility of 4.5 e −5 bar −1 for water. Following equilibrations, productive MD runs were started with the same parameters as NPT. For LysG and LysG-A219L two 1 µs simulations were calculated. For each of the eight complex systems 250 ns simulations were conducted, resulting in a total of 6 µs simulation. The docking poses, parametrizations, and run input files of productive MD are made available at.

### Olipudase alfa-rpcp (Xenpozyme) [^90c8a8ae]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Reconstitution and Dilution Instructions

Determine the number of XENPOZYME vials to be reconstituted based on the calculated dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)] .
Remove XENPOZYME vials from refrigeration and set aside for approximately 20 to 30 minutes to allow vials to reach room temperature.
Reconstitute each vial with:
1.1 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP into the 4 mg vial
5.1 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP into the 20 mg vial
by directing the diluent flow to the inside wall of the vial to avoid foaming.
Gently roll and tilt vial(s) to reconstitute XENPOZYME and avoid foaming. Each reconstituted vial will yield a 4 mg/mL clear, colorless solution.
Visually inspect the reconstituted solution in the vials for particulate matter and discoloration. The solution should be clear and colorless. Discard if the solution is discolored or if visible particulate matter is present.
Withdraw the required volume of XENPOZYME from the vial(s) and dilute the XENPOZYME solution for infusion with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP in a syringe or infusion bag depending on the volume of infusion (see Table 4).
For patients who weigh less than 10 kg receiving 0.03 mg/kg and 0.1 mg/kg and patients who weigh between 10 to 20 kg receiving 0.03 mg/kg dose, the volume of infusion will vary to achieve a fixed final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL (see Table 4). Prepare the required dose diluted to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL in a syringe for infusion.
For all other patient weights and doses, the final concentration will vary to achieve a fixed total volume (see Table 4).
For total volume less than or equal to 20 mL prepare a syringe for infusion:
Inject the required volume of the reconstituted XENPOZYME solution (4 mg/mL) from step 3 slowly down the inside wall of the syringe.
Add slowly the quantity sufficient of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP to obtain the required total infusion volume (avoid foaming within the syringe).
For a total volume of greater than or equal to 50 mL prepare an infusion bag :
Add slowly the required volume of the reconstituted XENPOZYME solution (4 mg/mL) from step 3 into the appropriate size 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP infusion bag (avoid foaming within the bag) to achieve a fixed total volume per Table 4.
Gently invert the syringe or the infusion bag to mix. Do not shake. Because this is a protein solution, slight flocculation (described as thin translucent fibers) occurs occasionally after dilution.
Vials are for single dose only. Discard any unused solution.

### Observing the overall rocking motion of a protein in a crystal [^56bf93e9]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

MD simulations and analysis

The initial coordinates for the MPD-ub simulation were obtained from the crystallographic structure 3ONS (ref.). Four flexible C-terminal residues of ubiquitin were rebuilt as described previously. To determine the protonation status of ionizable residues, we performed the PROPKAcalculations for ubiquitin in the relevant crystal-lattice environment. The effective pH was assumed to be 4.2, same as in the crystallization buffer of 3ONS. The original dimensions of the unit crystal cell were all multiplied by a factor 1.016 to account for thermal expansion of the protein crystal on transition from 100 (temperature at which 3ONS was solved) to 301 K. The unit crystal cell was hydrated using SPC/E water; in doing so, the crystallographic water molecules have been retained in their original positions. The system was neutralized by adding Cl − ions. The periodic boundary box was defined as a block of four crystal unit cells, containing 24 ubiquitin molecules and 8,772 water molecules, for the total of 56,244 atoms. The simulations were conducted under Amber ff99SB*-ILDN force field using Amber 11 program. The trajectory was recorded at 301 K, using isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble. The volume of the simulation box remains stable throughout the simulation within 0.5% of its target value (on average, there is a slight uniform expansion as described by linear factor 1.0009). The production rate with NVIDIA GeForce GTX580 cards was 9 ns per card per day. The net length of the trajectory was 1 μs.

### Planning for sustainable cities by estimating building occupancy with mobile phones [^68e7b8f2]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Accurate occupancy is crucial for planning for sustainable buildings. Using massive, passively-collected mobile phone data, we introduce a novel framework to estimate building occupancy at unprecedented scale. We show that, at urban-scale, occupancy differs widely from current estimates based on building types. For commercial buildings, we find typical occupancy rates are 5 times lower than current assumptions imply, while for residential buildings occupancy rates vary widely by neighborhood. Our mobile phone based occupancy estimates are integrated with a state-of-the-art urban building energy model to understand their impact on energy use predictions. Depending on the assumed relationship between occupancy and internal building loads, we find energy consumption which differs by +1% to -15% for residential buildings and by -4% to -21% for commercial buildings, compared to standard methods. This highlights a need for new occupancy-to-load models which can be applied at urban-scale to the diverse set of city building types.

### Support surfaces for pressure ulcer prevention [^0220670a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Pressure ulcers (also known as bedsores, pressure sores, decubitus ulcers) are areas of localised damage to the skin and underlying tissue due to pressure, shear or friction. They are common in the elderly and immobile and costly in financial and human terms. Pressure-relieving beds, mattresses and seat cushions are widely used as aids to prevention in both institutional and non-institutional settings.

Objectives

This systematic review seeks to answer the following questions:(1) to what extent do pressure-relieving cushions, beds, mattress overlays and mattress replacements reduce the incidence of pressure ulcers compared with standard support surfaces?(2) how effective are different pressure-relieving surfaces in preventing pressure ulcers, compared to one another?

Search Strategy

For this second update the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register was searched (28/2/08), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)(2008 Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to February Week 3 2008), Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 2008 Week 08) and Ovid CINAHL (1982 to February Week 3 2008). The reference sections of included studies were searched for further trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), published or unpublished, which assessed the effectiveness of beds, mattresses, mattress overlays, and seating cushions for the prevention of pressure ulcers, in any patient group, in any setting. Study selection was undertaken by at least two authors independently with a third author resolving uncertainty. RCTs were eligible for inclusion if they reported an objective, clinical outcome measure such as incidence and severity of new of pressure ulcers developed. Studies which only reported proxy outcome measures such as interface pressure were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial data were extracted by one researcher and checked by a second. The results from each study are presented as relative risk for dichotomous variables. Where deemed appropriate, similar studies were pooled in a meta analysis.

Main Results

For this second update 11 trials met the inclusion criteria bringing the total number of RCTs included in the review to 52.Foam alternatives to the standard hospital foam mattress can reduce the incidence of pressure ulcers in people at risk. The relative merits of alternating and constant low pressure devices are unclear. There is one high quality trial comparing the different alternating pressure devices for pressure ulcer prevention which suggests that alternating pressure mattresses may be more cost effective than alternating pressure overlays.Pressure-relieving overlays on the operating table have been shown to reduce postoperative pressure ulcer incidence, although two studies indicated that foam overlays resulted in adverse skin changes. Two trials indicated that Australian standard medical sheepskins prevented pressure ulcers. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the value of seat cushions, limb protectors and various constant low pressure devices as pressure ulcer prevention strategies.A study of Accident & Emergency trolley overlays did not identify a reduction in pressure ulcer incidence. There are tentative indications that foot waffle heel elevators, a particular low air loss hydrotherapy mattress and two types of operating theatre overlays are harmful.

Authors' Conclusions

In people at high risk of pressure ulcer development higher specification foam mattresses rather than standard hospital foam mattresses should be used. The relative merits of higher-tech constant low pressure and alternating pressure for prevention are unclear but alternating pressure mattresses may be more cost effective than alternating pressure overlays. Medical grade sheepskins are associated with a decrease in pressure ulcer development. Organisations might consider the use of some forms of pressure relief for high risk patients in the operating theatre. Seat cushions and overlays designed for use in Accident & Emergency settings have not been adequately evaluated.

Local dimension and persistence

To determine d, we exploit recent results from the application of extreme value theory to Poincaré recurrences in dynamical systems. This approach considers long trajectories of a system—in our case successions of daily SLP latitude–longitude maps—corresponding to a sequence of states on the attractor. For a given point ζ in phase space (e.g. a given SLP map), we compute the probability that the system returns within a ball of radiuscentred on the point ζ. The Freitas et al.theorem, modified by Lucarini et al. states that logarithmic returns:

yield a probability distribution such that:

where z = g (x (t)) and s is a high threshold associated to a quantile q of the series g (x (t)). Requiring that the orbit falls within a ball of radiusaround the point ζ is equivalent to asking that the series g (x (t)) is over the threshold s ; therefore, the ball radiusis simply e − s(q). The resulting distribution is the exponential member of the Generalised Pareto Distribution family. The parameters μ and σ, namely the location and the scale parameter of the distribution, depend on the point ζ in phase space. μ (ζ) corresponds to the threshold s (q), while the local dimension d (ζ) can be obtained via the relation.

When x (t) contains all the variables of the system, the estimation of d based on extreme value theory has a number of advantages over traditional methods (e.g. the box counting algorithm,). First, it does not require to estimate the volume of different sets in scale space: the selection of s (q) based on the quantile provides a selection of different scales s, which depends on the recurrence rate around the point ζ. Moreover, it does not require the a priori selection of the maximum embedding dimension as the observable g is always a univariate time-series.

The persistence of the state ζ is measured via the extremal index, an adimensional parameter, from which we extract. θ (ζ) is therefore the inverse of the average residence time of trajectories aroundand it has unit of a frequency (in this study 1/days). If ζ is a fixed point of the attractor. For a trajectory that leaves the neighbourhood of ζ at the next time iteration, θ = 1. To estimate θ, we adopt the Süveges estimator. For further details on the extremal index, see ref.
