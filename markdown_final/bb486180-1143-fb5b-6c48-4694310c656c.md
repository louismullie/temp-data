## Question

remeron 7.5 mg for appetite suppresant?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Remeron (mirtazapine) 7.5 mg can be used as an appetite suppressant. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about mirtazapine's pharmacology and whether it increases or decreases appetite. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says about appetite and weight effects. Next, I will review clinical trial data, including randomized trials in cancer-related anorexia, to see if low-dose mirtazapine suppresses appetite. After that, I need to check dosing guidance and whether 7.5 mg is typically used for appetite suppression or the opposite. Finally, I will consider mechanistic plausibility and synthesize a clear clinical recommendation with safety considerations.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology, because I need to ensure I'm not misattributing effects. Mirtazapine is a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant with potent H1 antagonism and 5‑HT2A/2C antagonism; these receptor actions are consistently linked to increased appetite and weight gain rather than suppression, which is why mirtazapine is often used to stimulate appetite in appropriate contexts [^4a27a125] [^15e9d12a] [^1b0ddf19].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory labeling before drawing conclusions. The FDA prescribing information repeatedly highlights increased appetite and weight gain as common adverse effects, with appetite increase reported in 17% of treated patients versus 2% on placebo, and weight gain of at least 7% occurring in 7.5% on mirtazapine versus 0% on placebo; there is no labeled indication or statement suggesting appetite suppression at any dose, including low doses [^75488808] [^c7f2dc31] [^f7980220].

> I will now examine the clinical trial data to see if any randomized studies show appetite suppression at low doses. In a double-blind RCT of mirtazapine for cancer-associated anorexia/cachexia, mirtazapine 15 mg (with optional escalation to 30 mg) was not superior to placebo for improving appetite scores, despite increases in caloric intake, indicating no suppression signal even at higher starting doses; similarly, a JAMA Oncology RCT in NSCLC with anorexia showed increased energy intake without improved appetite scores versus placebo, again arguing against appetite suppression [^a182bd5a] [^854dfdcf] [^95f40a34].

> Hold on, I should verify dosing guidance and whether 7.5 mg is ever positioned to suppress appetite. Multiple authoritative guidelines and reviews note that lower doses of mirtazapine (often 7.5–15 mg) are associated with more sedation and more pronounced appetite stimulation, whereas higher doses tend to be less sedating; none propose 7.5 mg as an appetite-suppressing strategy, and geriatric guidance even starts at 7.5 mg to leverage sedation while anticipating weight gain, not loss [^a7ee1d7c] [^ad3890d3] [^3b690bf9].

> Let me consider mechanistic plausibility, because I need to ensure the biology aligns with the clinical observations. H1 antagonism and 5‑HT2C antagonism both disinhibit appetite circuits, and mirtazapine's clinical profile includes hyperphagia and weight gain; there is no credible mechanism by which 7.5 mg would reverse this to suppress appetite, and physiologic studies in healthy volunteers show weight gain and symptom improvement without evidence of appetite suppression [^15e9d12a] [^10cdf9cf] [^1b0ddf19].

> But wait, what if someone is using 7.5 mg purely for sedation and inadvertently experiences less appetite due to sleep-related effects? I should double-check that nuance. Even if sedation improves sleep, the pharmacodynamic appetite-stimulating properties of mirtazapine persist, and clinical data do not show a net appetite-suppressing effect at low dose; thus, any apparent reduction in intake would not be a reliable or intended pharmacologic effect of mirtazapine [^4a27a125] [^a182bd5a].

> I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and clinically actionable. Mirtazapine 7.5 mg does not act as an appetite suppressant; it is an appetite stimulant at low doses, with FDA labeling documenting increased appetite and weight gain, and randomized trials in anorectic populations failing to show appetite suppression. Using mirtazapine to suppress appetite would be pharmacologically contradictory and unsupported by evidence or guidelines [^75488808] [^a182bd5a] [^854dfccf] [^ad3890d3].

> Finally, I should confirm safety and off-label context so I don't overgeneralize. Mirtazapine carries risks of somnolence, weight gain, metabolic effects, and rare hematologic or hepatic adverse effects; if appetite stimulation is desired (for example, in cachexia, functional dyspepsia with weight loss, or geriatric patients with poor intake), low-dose mirtazapine may be reasonable, but if appetite suppression is the goal, alternative agents with weight-loss profiles (for example, bupropion) or anti-obesity pharmacotherapies should be considered instead of mirtazapine [^edebef31] [^379c6c52] [^21cbea1c].

---

Remeron (mirtazapine) 7.5 mg is **not an appetite suppressant**; at low doses, it is more likely to increase appetite and cause weight gain due to H1 antagonism and 5-HT2C blockade [^4a27a125] [^15e9d12a]. There is **no evidence** that 7.5 mg suppresses appetite, and it is not used for this purpose clinically. If appetite suppression is needed, consider alternatives such as bupropion or GLP-1 agonists [^21cbea1c] [^81b5e95b].

---

## Pharmacological mechanisms relevant to appetite

Mirtazapine's effects on appetite are **primarily mediated** through its antagonism of histamine H1 receptors and serotonin 5-HT2C receptors [^4a27a125]. H1 antagonism is associated with increased appetite and weight gain, while 5-HT2C blockade removes inhibitory control over appetite, further promoting food intake [^15e9d12a]. These effects are more pronounced at lower doses, particularly around 7.5–15 mg, where H1 occupancy is highest [^a7ee1d7c].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding appetite effects at low doses

Clinical studies consistently show that mirtazapine, even at low doses, **increases appetite and promotes weight gain** [^75488808]. In a randomized controlled trial of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and anorexia, mirtazapine (15–30 mg) significantly increased energy intake and reduced sarcopenia, although appetite scores did not change significantly, indicating a direct metabolic effect on intake rather than subjective appetite suppression [^854dfdcf]. Similarly, in patients with functional dyspepsia and weight loss, mirtazapine 15 mg improved early satiation, nutrient tolerance, and weight, again suggesting appetite stimulation rather than suppression [^a4182cd3].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines and expert reviews **do not recommend mirtazapine** for appetite suppression. Instead, they emphasize its role in managing conditions characterized by reduced appetite and weight loss, such as cancer cachexia, functional dyspepsia, and geriatric patients with poor appetite [^379c6c52] [^1ba9564d]. The VA/DoD guideline notes that mirtazapine may be useful for low appetite and weight loss, particularly in older adults, but does not mention appetite suppression as a therapeutic goal [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other antidepressants

Compared with other antidepressants, mirtazapine is **more strongly associated with increased appetite and weight gain** [^4a27a125]. SSRIs and SNRIs generally have neutral or modest effects on appetite, while bupropion is associated with appetite suppression and weight loss [^21cbea1c]. This pharmacological profile further supports that mirtazapine, especially at low doses, is unlikely to suppress appetite.

---

## Clinical scenarios where mirtazapine 7.5 mg might be used

Mirtazapine 7.5 mg may be considered in clinical scenarios where appetite stimulation and weight gain are desired, such as:

- **Cancer cachexia**: To improve appetite and nutritional intake [^1ba9564d].
- **Functional dyspepsia**: Particularly with early satiation and weight loss [^379c6c52].
- **Geriatric patients**: With poor appetite and unintentional weight loss [^a7ee1d7c].

---

## Potential risks and side effects

While mirtazapine is generally well tolerated, it carries risks of **sedation, weight gain, and metabolic effects**, which may limit its use in patients where weight gain is undesirable [^edebef31]. Clinicians should monitor for these adverse effects and adjust therapy accordingly.

---

## Alternative medications for appetite suppression

If appetite suppression is the therapeutic goal, **alternative medications** may be considered:

- **Bupropion**: Associated with appetite suppression and weight loss [^21cbea1c].
- **GLP-1 agonists**: Such as liraglutide, have been shown to reduce appetite and promote weight loss [^81b5e95b].
- **Naltrexone-bupropion combination**: Approved for weight management and appetite suppression.

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

In summary, Remeron (mirtazapine) 7.5 mg is **not an appetite suppressant**; it is more likely to increase appetite and promote weight gain, particularly at low doses [^75488808]. There is **no clinical evidence** supporting its use for appetite suppression, and it is not recommended for this purpose in current guidelines. Clinicians should consider alternative medications if appetite suppression is the therapeutic goal [^21cbea1c].

5.7	Increased Appetite and Weight Gain

In U.S. controlled clinical studies, appetite increase was reported in 17% of patients treated with REMERON, compared to 2% for placebo. In these same trials, weight gain of ≥ 7% of body weight was reported in 7.5% of patients treated with mirtazapine, compared to 0% for placebo. In a pool of premarketing U.S. clinical studies, including many patients for long-term, open-label treatment, 8% of patients receiving REMERON discontinued for weight gain.

In an 8-week-long pediatric clinical trial of doses between 15 to 45 mg/day, 49% of REMERON-treated pediatric patients had a weight gain of at least 7%, compared to 5.7% of placebo-treated patients. The safety and effectiveness of REMERON/REMERONSolTab in pediatric patients with MDD have not been established [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

5.8	Somnolence

In U.S. controlled studies, somnolence was reported in 54% of patients treated with REMERON, compared to 18% for placebo. In these studies, somnolence resulted in discontinuation for 10.4% of REMERON-treated patients, compared to 2.2% for placebo. It is unclear whether tolerance develops to the somnolent effects of REMERON/REMERONSolTab. Because of the potentially significant effects of REMERON/REMERONSolTab on impairment of performance, caution patients about engaging in activities that require alertness, including operating hazardous machinery and motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that REMERON/REMERONSolTab does not affect them adversely. The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and alcohol with REMERON/REMERONSolTab should be avoided [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.9 Activation of Mania or Hypomania

In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with mirtazapine or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. In controlled clinical trials, patients with bipolar disorder were generally excluded; however, symptoms of mania or hypomania were reported in 0.2% of patients treated with mirtazapine. Prior to initiating treatment with mirtazapine, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania.

6.1	Clinical Trial Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The data described below are from clinical trials in which REMERON/REMERONSolTab was administered to 2796 patients in phase 2 and 3 clinical studies. The trials consisted of double-blind controlled and open-label studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, fixed dose, and titration studies.

Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation of Treatment

Approximately 16% of the 453 patients who received REMERON in U.S. 6-week placebo-controlled clinical trials discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction, compared to 7% of the 361 placebo-treated patients in those studies. The most common reactions leading to discontinuation (≥ 1% and at a rate at least twice that of placebo) are included in Table 2.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Approximately 190 patients ≥ 65 years of age participated in clinical studies with REMERON. REMERON/REMERONSolTab is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney (75%), and the risk of decreased clearance of this drug is greater in patients with impaired renal function. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed a decreased clearance of mirtazapine in the elderly [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Sedating drugs, including REMERON/REMERONSolTab, may cause confusion and over-sedation in the elderly. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia. Caution is indicated when administering REMERON/REMERONSolTab to elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12), (5.15) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be conservative, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

8.6	Renal or Hepatic Impairment

The clearance of mirtazapine is reduced in patients with moderate to severe renal or hepatic impairment. Consequently, plasma mirtazapine levels may be increased in these patient groups, compared to levels observed in patients without renal or hepatic impairment. Dosage decrease may be necessary when administering REMERON/REMERONSolTab to patients with moderate to severe renal or hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13), Use in Specific Populations (8.5), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7	Patients with Phenylketonuria

REMERONSolTab contains phenylalanine, a component of aspartame. REMERONSolTab contains the following amount of phenylalanine: 2.6 mg in 15 mg orally disintegrating tablet, 5.2 mg in 30 mg orally disintegrating tablet, and 7.8 mg in 45 mg orally disintegrating tablet [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16)].

8.2	Lactation

Risk Summary

Data from published literature report the presence of mirtazapine in human milk at low levels with relative infant doses for mirtazapine ranging between 0.6 and 2.8% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose (see Data). No adverse effects on the breastfed infant have been reported in most cases of maternal use of mirtazapine. There are no data on the effects of mirtazapine on milk production.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for mirtazapine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from mirtazapine or from the underlying maternal condition.

Data

In a published pooled analysis of 8 breastfeeding mother-infant pairs, the mean (min, max) total relative infant doses for mirtazapine and its desmethyl metabolite were 1.5% (0.6%, 2.8%) and 0.4% (0.1%, 0.7%) of the maternal weight-adjusted dose (median (min, max) dose of 38 mg (30 mg, 120 mg), respectively). No adverse drug effects were reported for any of the infants.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of REMERON/REMERONSolTab have not been established in pediatric patients with MDD. Two placebo-controlled trials in 258 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with REMERON, and the data were insufficient to establish the safety and effectiveness of REMERON/REMERONSolTab in pediatric patients with MDD.

Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

In an 8-week-long clinical trial in pediatric patients receiving doses between 15 to 45 mg per day, 49% of REMERON-treated patients had a weight gain of at least 7%, compared to 5.7% of placebo-treated patients. The mean increase in weight was 4 kg (2 kg SD) for REMERON-treated patients versus 1 kg (2 kg SD) for placebo-treated patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

### What is the evidence for mirtazapine in treating cancer-related symptomatology? A systematic review [^93dee189]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Evidence from non-randomised non-controlled trials

We recorded seven non-randomised non-controlled trials which were all before and after designs. They assessed a number of symptoms including the following: depression, anxiety, emesis, insomnia, anorexia, weight loss, breathlessness, fatigue and pain. The studies had small sample sizes (on average 24.1 participants in each study) and a high risk of bias.

Theobald et al. report a 6-week open-label crossover trial comparing the effectiveness of mirtazapine 15 mg versus mirtazapine 30 mg in cancer patients experiencing pain. Evaluated outcomes were pain, depression, nausea and appetite. The study included 20 patients over a 6-week period with a low follow-up completion rate (0.55). The authors assessed pain, appetite, and nausea and vomiting using a numeric rating scale and found no change for any symptom between baseline and end-point. However, patients did report feeling less concerned about their weight at week 4 (F = 12.9, p < 0.01) and week 7 (F = 4.7, p < 0.05) when compared with baseline. Depression was assessed using the Zung self-rating depression scale (ZSDS) which is validated for cancer. The authors report a significant improvement in the ZSDS scores at week 7 (F = 8.2, p < 0.05).

### What is the evidence for mirtazapine in treating cancer-related symptomatology? A systematic review [^df3268bb]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Raddin et al. report the results of a non-randomised controlled study including 18 patients over a 9-week period. The follow-up completion rate was 0.86. Participants received mirtazapine (starting dose 7.5 mg, escalated to 15 and then 30 mg as appropriate) or citalopram (starting dose 10 mg, escalated to 20 and then 40 mg as appropriate). Allocation was not concealed and was decided by clinical experience. The authors assessed depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) at baseline, weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 9. In this study, depression did not significantly improve in the overall cancer sample when evaluated using the PHQ-9. However, a sub-analysis which excluded actively dying patients showed a significant and clinically important difference of 7.6 (95% CI = [2.9–12.2]) after 9 weeks of treatment. The quality of sleep was evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The study reports a non-significant improvement in sleep quality when assessed using the PSQI score (11.0 versus 8.6, 95% CI = [− 2.2–6.9]) and a non-significant improvement of the hours of sleep (5.9 versus 7.5, 95% CI = [− 0.3–3.5]). The study did not find any significant difference for weight or fatigue across the different arms.

Oszoy et al. report an open-labelled study assessing the outcomes of radiotherapy-induced cachexia treated with mirtazapine 15–30 mg for 6 months in patients with head and neck cancer. The interventional group was made of patients diagnosed with major depression using the Hamilton depression rating scale, and they were compared with a control group who did not have a diagnosis of cancer or depression. The primary outcome of this study was to assess the effectiveness of mirtazapine on the level of two hormones involved in the regulation of food intake (ghrelin and leptin); secondary outcomes were assessment of weight and body mass index. The results are challenging to analyse, and no conclusion can be reached as baseline characteristics highly differ between the groups.

Whereas it has often been claimed that SSRIs, to a greater extent than non-serotonergic antidepressants, may provoke suicidal ideation, especially shortly after the onset of treatment, previous meta-analyses comparing SSRIs with placebo have shown that SSRIs on average reduce suicidality already 1–2 weeks after onset of treatment (and onwards)., In the same vein, the present study provides no support for SSRIs being more likely to enhance suicidality than mirtazapine — on the contrary, ratings of suicidality numerically favoured both SSRIs and venlafaxine over mirtazapine. This difference reaching significance when the SSRI- and venlafaxine-treated populations were combined (Supplementary Figure S1).

In line with some early trials suggesting mirtazapine to be associated with a more rapid onset of action than the SSRIs, a separation favouring mirtazapine with respect to HDRS-17-sum over SSRIs or venlafaxine was found already after one week of treatment. This superiority, however, was also entirely explained by an early difference with respect to items reflecting sleep, weight, and gastrointestinal symptoms (Fig. 3, Supplementary Figure S1).

Discussion

The main question addressed in this study was to what extent previous data suggesting amitriptyline to be superior to other antidepressants, and mirtazapine to be at least as effective as the more commonly used SSRIs and SNRIs, can be explained by differences between these drugs vs the SSRIs/SNRIs with respect to how they impact sleep and appetite. While mirtazapine outperformed SSRIs (but not venlafaxine) with respect to the conventional effect parameter, i.e. the HDRS-17-sum, this was entirely explained by the former drug being superior with respect to sleep items and items reflecting appetite and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Though clearly superior to placebo with respect to most HDRS items (Fig. 2), mirtazapine was thus inferior to SSRIs in reducing depressed mood, inferior to venlafaxine in reducing psychic anxiety and work and activities, and inferior to the combined SSRI plus SNRI group in reducing depressed mood, psychic anxiety, and suicidality (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figure S1). Due to its potent sedative and orexigenic effects, mirtazapine however still outperformed SSRIs on the HDRS-17-sum after six weeks of treatment (Fig. 1). Conversely, amitriptyline — and more clearly the pooled TCA group — performed as well or better than mirtazapine on all individual HDRS items (Fig. 3, Supplementary Figure S2).

Fifth, prompted by the abovementioned difference in baseline symptomatology between trials comparing mirtazapine to amitriptyline and SSRIs, respectively, we also assessed the extent to which differences in study design may have introduced spurious between-treatment differences. To this end, we compared outcomes with mirtazapine between trials using amitriptyline, venlafaxine, or an SSRI, respectively, as comparator.

All endpoint analyses were repeated using analysis of covariance models (ANCOVA) applying the last observation carried forward (LOCF) methodology and including all patients with a post-baseline observation.

Ethics

Since the data were anonymized and could not be traced back to the individuals once participating in the trials in question, neither obtaining informed consent nor requesting ethical permit to conduct the study was applicable. We however did request and obtain a statement from the Swedish Ethical Review Authority confirming this to be the case.

Role of the funding source

The funders of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. All authors had full access to the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.

### Mirtazapine as appetite stimulant in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and anorexia: a randomized clinical trial [^95f40a34]. JAMA Oncology (2024). High credibility.

The study Mirtazapine for CRCA was published by Oscar Arrieta and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Oncol. This study is related to the following diseases: Non-small cell lung cancer and Cancer-associated cachexia. In the Mirtazapine for CRCA study, the trial question was: what is the role of mirtazapine in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and anorexia? In the Mirtazapine for CRCA study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the Mirtazapine for CRCA study, the population was: 71 patients (41 female, 30 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and anorexia. The key exclusion criteria were known allergy to mirtazapine; treatment with antidepressants; treatment with megestrol acetate; moderate hepatic and/or renal dysfunction; mechanical obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract, ascites, or generalized edema. In the Mirtazapine for CRCA study, the interventions were: n = 38 mirtazapine (at a dose of 15 mg for 2 weeks followed by dose escalation to 30 mg until week 8) n = 33 placebo (matching placebo). In the Mirtazapine for CRCA study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in improvement in Anorexia Cachexia Scale at week 8 (12 points vs. 11 points; AD 1 points, 95% CI -1.03 to 3.03). In the Mirtazapine for CRCA study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in improvement in energy requirement achieved at 4 weeks (26.1% vs. 8.8%; AD 17.3%, 95% CI 7.03 to 27.57) Significant decrease in proportion of patients with sarcopenia at week 8 (57.1% vs. 82.8%; ARD -25.7, 95% CI -48.95 to -2.45) No significant difference in reduction in visceral adipose tissue at week 8 (17.1 cm2 vs. 10.6 cm2; AD 6.5 cm2, 95% CI -4.97 to 17.97). In the Mirtazapine for CRCA study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in hematologic and nonhematologic adverse events. significant difference in severity perception of fatigue at 8 weeks (4.5 vs. 2.0). In the Mirtazapine for CRCA study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and anorexia, mirtazapine was not superior to placebo with respect to improvement in Anorexia Cachexia Scale at week 8.

Results

Patients

Table 1 details characteristics of the 37 included trials. The data set consisted of 5974 patients treated with placebo or an antidepressant. 381 mirtazapine patients were included in multiple analyses since they originated from three-arm studies including both placebo and an active comparator. The subpopulations thus consisted of 1578 patients (968 on mirtazapine) for mirtazapine vs placebo, 2731 patients (1362 on mirtazapine) for mirtazapine vs SSRI, 391 patients (202 on mirtazapine) for mirtazapine vs venlafaxine, 1228 patients (606 on mirtazapine) for mirtazapine vs amitriptyline, and 427 patients (218 on mirtazapine) for mirtazapine vs TCAs other than amitriptyline.

Direct comparisons over time

Fig. 1 a–c shows effect sizes (with 95% confidence intervals) vs mirtazapine for placebo, SSRIs, venlafaxine, and amitriptyline at all post-baseline timepoints with respect to HDRS-17- sum, HDRS-6-sum, and depressed mood. With respect to HDRS-17-sum, mirtazapine outperformed SSRIs throughout the trials but with attenuating effect sizes over time; the difference between mirtazapine and venlafaxine displayed a similar trajectory. With respect to HDRS-6-sum, mirtazapine never outperformed SSRIs and outperformed venlafaxine at visit one only — at endpoint, there was a non-significant tendency for both SSRIs and venlafaxine to outperform mirtazapine. With respect to depressed mood, mirtazapine never outperformed SSRIs or venlafaxine — at endpoint, patients on SSRIs (significantly) and those on venlafaxine (non-significantly) were rated lower than those on mirtazapine. Notably, considerably fewer patients were treated with venlafaxine (n = 189) than with an SSRI (n = 1369).

### Is increased antidepressant exposure a contributory factor to the obesity pandemic? [^15e9d12a]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Mirtazapine

Mirtazapine (SNRI) has been associated with weight gain. The mechanism of mirtazapine involves the blockade of α2-adrenergic receptors, together with affinity for histamine H1 receptors and low affinity for dopaminergic D1 and D2 receptors. It has been suggested that the histaminergic system is involved in appetite and feeding control. These histaminergic cell bodies are situated in a specific region called the tuberomammilary nucleus of the posterior hypothalamus. Histaminergic receptors have been shown to interact with orexigenic neuropeptides such as orexin A, NPY and ghrelin. Anti-histaminergic effects of mirtazapine were associated with enhanced appetite by activation of ghrelin and NPY. Furthermore, clinical doses of mirtazapine blocked both 5HT2 and 5HT3 receptors.5HT2 receptors have an essential role in appetite, and antagonising 5HT2 results in weight gain.

### Impact of sedative and appetite-increasing properties on the apparent antidepressant efficacy of mirtazapine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and amitriptyline: an item-based, patient-level meta-analysis [^339994af]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The most common efficacy parameter in depression trials has been the reduction in the sum score of the 17-item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17-sum). Since three HDRS items reflect sleep and two reflect appetite and weight, a drug improving sleep and/or enhancing appetite may cause an apparent reduction in depression severity independently of any actual antidepressant effect. Both amitriptyline and mirtazapine displaying sedative and orexigenic properties, hence raises the question of to what extent this difference may explain why the former, and possibly the latter, come out as superior compared to the SSRIs and SNRIs with respect to HDRS-17-sum-assessed efficacy.

The development program for mirtazapine mainly included trials comparing it to placebo, SSRIs, or amitriptyline. To a lesser extent, three other TCAs and one SNRI also served as comparators. These studies hence lend themselves well to assessing how differences in sedative and appetite-increasing effects translates into apparent antidepressant efficacy. In this patient-level meta-analysis, we assess how all 17 individual symptoms rated by the HDRS-17 develop during six weeks acute-phase treatment for depression for the studied antidepressants (and placebo).

Statistical analysis

All analyses were done in SAS Software 9.4. Since 25 out of the 37 studies had a duration of six weeks only, and since sex weeks of treatment should be sufficient to demonstrate an antidepressant effect, the week six visit — from which data were available in 33 out of 37 studies — was selected as primary endpoint. For analyses of early effects, week one data or — if there was no week one visit — week two data were used.

First, effect sizes — defined as the mean difference divided by the root of the variance for a particular time-point — and p-values over time were calculated for the comparison of mirtazapine vs SSRIs, venlafaxine, and amitriptyline for i) HDRS-17-sum, ii) the HDRS-6 subscale (item 1: depressed mood, 2: guilt, 7: work and activities, 8: psychomotor retardation, 10: psychic anxiety, and 13: general somatic symptoms), and iii) the depressed mood item. Each analysis only included trials directly comparing mirtazapine to the corresponding comparator. The analyses used a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) specification for the SAS PROC MIXED procedure. All models included fixed factors for trial, time (week), and treatment, as well as the interaction between time and treatment. Baseline score for the outcome parameter was included as a covariate. Within-subject correlations over time were modelled using an unstructured variance-covariance matrix and the Kenward-Roger approximation was used to approximate denominator degrees of freedom. In cases where the model did not converge using an unstructured variance-covariance matrix, an autoregressive matrix with heterogeneous variance was used.

Summary

Background

In an influential network meta-analysis, the tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) amitriptyline was found to be the most efficacious of 21 antidepressants, hence outranking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). The alpha 2 /5HT 2A / 2C / 3 /H 1 antagonist mirtazapine was ranked as the second most effective and appeared at least as effective as the SSRIs and SNRIs that followed next. Since the most common effect parameter in depression trials — the sum score of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17-sum) — includes three items measuring sleep and two measuring appetite and weight, this outcome could be the result of amitriptyline and mirtazapine being more sedative and orexigenic. The main aim of this study was to compare mirtazapine with SSRIs or amitriptyline with respect to impact on core depression symptoms.

Methods

Access to patient-level data from all company-sponsored, acute-phase, HDRS-based, and randomized trials of mirtazapine in adult major depression available to Merck was granted. Thirty-two studies compared mirtazapine to placebo and/or amitriptyline or an SSRI whereas five compared mirtazapine to another TCA or an SNRI, venlafaxine. Data were divided into subgroups for direct comparisons of mirtazapine vs placebo or different subgroups of antidepressants. Indirect comparisons of SSRIs vs amitriptyline were also undertaken. Mixed models for repeated measures were used to assess efficacy as reflected by i) HDRS-17-sum, ii) six core depression symptoms (HDRS-6-sum), and iii) all individual items.

Findings

The dataset consisted of 5974 participants. Mirtazapine (n = 1362) outperformed SSRIs (n = 1369) on HDRS-17-sum, but this was due to differences regarding items reflecting sleep, appetite, and gastrointestinal dysfunction — with respect to reducing depressed mood, suicidality, and psychic anxiety, SSRIs and/or venlafaxine were more effective. Amitriptyline (n = 622) was superior to mirtazapine (n = 606) in reducing depressed mood, and the combined group of all TCAs (n = 831) outperformed mirtazapine (n = 824) also with respect to other core depression symptoms. Since there were no head-to-head comparisons of amitriptyline vs SSRIs, no firm conclusion may be drawn with respect to relative efficacy of the two, but indirect comparisons support the notion that amitriptyline and other tricyclics may be superior also to SSRIs.

Interpretation

While the apparent superiority of mirtazapine over SSRIs is explained by its sedative and orexigenic properties, and by its absence of gastrointestinal side effects, amitriptyline appeared more effective in reducing core symptoms of depression than mirtazapine and possibly also than SSRIs; given the indirect nature of the latter comparison, this outcome should however be interpreted with caution. Lack of information regarding dosing was another important limitation. The study illustrates the value of item-based analyses when assessing the relative efficacy of antidepressants.

### What is the evidence for mirtazapine in treating cancer-related symptomatology? A systematic review [^5549b452]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Evidence from non-randomised controlled trials

Three non-randomised controlled trials were identified. Two compared mirtazapine with other antidepressant drugs, one with imipramine and a control group, and the second with citalopram. The last one compared mirtazapine with a non-interventional control group. The studies attempted to assess a wide range of symptoms including depression, anxiety, pain, appetite, emesis, insomnia, weight loss and fatigue using validated tools. Overall, the sample sizes were small (43.7 participants on average) with a high risk of bias (Table 1).

Cankurtaran et al. report a randomised-controlled trial; however, in this study, the control group was participants who had refused the intervention (mirtazapine). We have therefore considered this to be a non-randomised controlled trial. The study included 53 patients over a 6-week period with a follow-up completion rate of 0.66. Participants were cancer patients with various diagnoses. One arm received an unspecified dose of mirtazapine in addition to supportive therapy for 6 weeks, the second one received imipramine in addition to supportive therapy and the third (who had refused antidepressant treatment) received only supportive therapy. The evaluated outcomes were nausea, vomiting, reduced appetite, weight, sleep disorders, depression, anxiety and pain. Results did not show any difference in nausea or vomiting (using a single symptom scale). When assessing for pain, no difference was found between arms using a numerical rating scale. Anxiety and depression were assessed using a validated tool in cancer, the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS). The study found a statistically and clinically significant difference in anxiety (− 3.7 points, p = 0.025) and depression (− 4.7 points, p = 0.003) for patients taking mirtazapine, compared with imipramine and control. The effectiveness on sleep disorders was assessed using the Hamilton depression rating scale (HAM-D) which is validated in cancer. For initial, middle and late insomnia, only the mirtazapine group showed improvement (p = 0.001, p = 0.001, p = 0.003). Using single symptom scales, no significant difference was found for appetite or weight change in the mirtazapine group when compared with the other arms.

### Efficacy and safety of mirtazapine in major depressive disorder patients after SSRI treatment failure: an open-label trial [^2858f96d]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of mirtazapine in depressed outpatients who have shown nonresponse or intolerance to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) therapy.

Method

In this open-label, 8-week study, the efficacy and safety of mirtazapine among 103 outpatients with DSM-IV major depressive disorder who had failed previous therapy with an SSRI (fluoxetine, paroxetine, or sertraline) were evaluated. The primary efficacy measure was the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17), and safety assessments included reported adverse events, routine laboratory assessments, physical examinations, and assessments of vital signs. A 4-day washout period followed by mirtazapine treatment was compared with an immediate switch from the SSRI to mirtazapine.

Results

Based on mean HAM-D-17 scores at endpoint and response rates of 48% based on the criterion of ≥ 50% reduction in HAM-D-17 score, mirtazapine was found to be an effective treatment for a substantial proportion of patients for whom an SSRI was ineffective and/or poorly tolerated. Mirtazapine was well tolerated, with sedation and appetite increase/weight gain the most commonly reported adverse events. In addition, no difference in efficacy, safety, or tolerability was observed for patients undergoing an immediate switch from an SSRI (after having been tapered to the minimal effective dose) to mirtazapine, compared with those undergoing the imposition of a 4-day drug-free washout.

Conclusion

These results suggest that an immediate switch to mirtazapine may be a valid therapeutic option among patients who cannot tolerate or do not respond to SSRIs.

### What is the evidence for mirtazapine in treating cancer-related symptomatology? A systematic review [^f2e7b6f8]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Material and methods

We performed a systematic review of the literature using eight different databases to identify studies relevant to our research question.

The full protocol is available in supplementary material 1.

Data sources

To identify relevant studies, we searched on Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Central and EMBASE. We searched for grey literature on Clinical Trials, the WHO ICTRP and OpenGrey. Investigators were contacted by e-mail to request any unpublished study details identified using the clinical trial databases. Additional records were identified using related articles and references as well as by open searches. The inclusion time frame covered all databases until the 15th of January 2019.

Research algorithms were designed to fit with each database to improve the sensitivity of the search (supplementary material 2). The titles and abstracts (if available) of yielded records were screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria to evaluate their eligibility. Full text articles were then read and non-relevant articles excluded.

Article selection

We included only primary literature: randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, case-controlled and non-randomised experimental studies, reporting original studies written in English or French languages. Experimental studies were required to use a control.

Included studies concerned patients diagnosed with cancer, excluding cancer survivors, with one or more of the following symptoms: depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, nausea, anorexia, weight loss, breathlessness, pain, constipation, fatigue and drowsiness. These symptoms were chosen based on the fact that they are the most frequently encountered symptoms in cancer and could potentially be addressed using mirtazapine given its pharmacological profile. The primary outcome of studies was improvement of one of the listed symptoms.

Data extraction

Data was extracted independently by two authors (GE, NL) regarding the effectiveness of mirtazapine (primary or secondary outcome) and the safety of its use. Authors extracted data on the year of publication and country of the study, number of participants, doses and modes of administration of mirtazapine and the comparator, follow-up completion rate, assessed symptoms and the tools used for assessment, results of the analysis, reported toxicity, adverse events and reasons for withdrawals.

### Mirtazapine as appetite stimulant in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and anorexia: a randomized clinical trial [^854dfdcf]. JAMA Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Currently there is no standard therapy to improve cancer-related anorexia, hampering survival. Mirtazapine has been suggested as a feasible option in this context.

Objectives

To assess the effect of mirtazapine on appetite and energy consumption in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial including adults was performed in a tertiary cancer care center from August 2018 to May 2022 with a follow-up of 8 weeks. Overall, 134 patients were screened; 114 were assessed for eligibility and 28 were excluded.

Interventions

Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive mirtazapine, 15 mg, or placebo for 2 weeks followed by a dose escalation to 30 mg until week 8 or placebo. Both groups received nutritional assessment and dietary advice.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Appetite was assessed by the Anorexia Cachexia Scale and energy intake. Dietary parameters were evaluated at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks, with a 24-hour dietary recall, and energy quantification based on the Mexican system of nutritional equivalents.

Results

A total of 86 patients met the inclusion criteria and were randomized to the placebo (n = 43) or the mirtazapine group (n = 43). The mean (SD) age was 63.5 (11.2) years, 41 were women (57.7%) and had adenocarcinoma, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status scale score of 1, stage IV NSCLC, and were receiving first-line treatment. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. There was no difference in appetite scores in patients who received mirtazapine or placebo after 4 and 8 weeks. After 4 weeks, mirtazapine significantly increased energy intake (379.3 kcal; 95% CI, 1382.6–576.1; P < .001) including proteins (22.5 g; 95% CI, 11.5–33.4; P = 0.001), carbohydrates (43.4 g; 95% CI, 13.1–73.8; P = 0.006), and fats (13.2 g; 95% CI, 6.0–20.4; P = 0.006). Fats intake was significantly higher in patients in the mirtazapine group (14.5 g vs 0.7 g; P = 0.02) after 8 weeks. The mirtazapine group significantly decreased the proportion of patients with sarcopenia (82.8% vs 57.1%, P = 0.03) at 8 weeks. Patients on mirtazapine tolerated the treatment well, but reported a higher perception of nightmares at 2 weeks based on a 10 cm VAS score (0 [25th-75th percentile, 0–1] vs 0 [25th-75th percentile, 0–0] in the control group; P = 0.009) but this finding was nonsignificant after 4 and 8 weeks.

Conclusion and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial of patients with advanced NSCLC, there was no difference in appetite scores in all patients who received mirtazapine or placebo, but the mirtazapine group had a significant increase in energy intake through the 4- and 8-week follow-up, mainly in fat intake, which is a better and crucial source of energy. The addition of mirtazapine in the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC and anorexia may help these patients achieve their energy requirements and improve health-related quality of life, specifically emotional and cognitive functioning.

### What is the evidence for mirtazapine in treating cancer-related symptomatology? A systematic review [^32f3e2cb]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cancer patients often experience multiple distressing symptoms simultaneously. The experience of multiple symptoms at the same time is referred to as polysymptomatology and requires multiple medications to mitigate their effect. The most burdensome includes fatigue, pain, lack of energy, weakness and loss of appetite, affecting more than half of patients with advanced cancer. These symptoms are a challenge to assess and treat, and very few drugs are licenced for this purpose. In this frail and multimorbid population, polymedication increases the risk of drug interactions and side effects. One approach to tackle this is identifying a single medication which can effectively treat multiple symptoms.

Mirtazapine, a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant, has proved effective in the treatment of depression in the cancer population. It has also been evaluated in several studies to alleviate other cancer-related symptoms. This pre-synaptic α2adrenoreceptor antagonist increases the central noradrenergic and serotoninergic neurotransmission. Whilst the cause of its effectiveness as an antidepressant remains unclear, it is hypothesised to be due to a blockage of pre-synaptic α2 receptors leading to the release of norepinephrine, and a better availability of neurotransmitters in the synapse. It also antagonizes α2 heteroreceptors leading to an increment of serotonin release. Besides these central noradrenergic and serotoninergic effects, mirtazapine has an affinity to the anti-H1 receptor and is an 5-HT3 antagonist, which could be relevant in treating sleep disorders, appetite and breathlessness. With this pharmacological profile, mirtazapine may be effective for the treatment of multiple symptoms, particularly those associated with cancer.

Mirtazapine is reported to be a safe antidepressant drug in the cancer population. It is almost completely metabolized by the liver and has a low-drug interaction risk, thus, allowing its use in advanced renal failure. However, some authors report drug-related symptoms such as dry-mouth, sedation, increased appetite and weight gain. Sedation, increased appetite and weight gain are specific to mirtazapine, and could be useful in the cancer population who commonly experience poor sleep and a lack of appetite.

The effectiveness and safety of mirtazapine in alleviating multiple symptoms in cancer populations remain unclear. This review aims to address this question.

### Impact of sedative and appetite-increasing properties on the apparent antidepressant efficacy of mirtazapine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and amitriptyline: an item-based, patient-level meta-analysis [^477a51d0]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Item-level comparisons of mirtazapine to other treatments

Mirtazapine outperformed placebo with respect to depressed mood, guilt, insomnia, psychomotor agitation, psychic anxiety, gastrointestinal symptoms, and weight loss at week one. At endpoint, mirtazapine outperformed placebo with respect to all HDRS items except suicidality, psychomotor retardation, sexual dysfunction, weight loss, and loss of insight (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Item-wise separation for mirtazapine vs placebo ager one and six weeks of treatment. Legend: The green centre line represents no difference between mirtazapine and placebo. Bars pointing towards the outer circle favour mirtazapine, where a bar reaching the outer circle would correspond to a mean difference (MD) of +0.4 points. Bars pointing towards the inner circle favour placebo where a bar reaching the inner circle would correspond to a mean difference of −0.4 points. ∗ = p < 0.05, ∗∗ = p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ = p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗ = p < 0.0001.

Mirtazapine outperformed SSRIs with respect to sleep items, work and activities, somatic anxiety, gastrointestinal symptoms, and weight loss at week one, and a similar pattern was observed also for the mirtazapine vs venlafaxine comparison. In contrast, at week six both SSRIs and venlafaxine performed numerically better than mirtazapine on several affective and cognitive symptoms of depression. SSRI treatment led to a significantly larger decrease in depressed mood and venlafaxine treatment did the same for psychic anxiety and work and activities (Fig. 3). When compared to a combined SSRI and SNRI group, mirtazapine showed less efficacy at endpoint with respect to reduction in depressed mood, psychic anxiety, and suicidality (Supplementary Figure S1). In contrast, mirtazapine outperformed SSRIs, venlafaxine, and the combined SSRI/SNRI group with respect to sleep items, somatic anxiety, gastrointestinal symptoms, and weight loss (Fig. 3 & Supplementary Figure S1).

### Impact of sedative and appetite-increasing properties on the apparent antidepressant efficacy of mirtazapine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and amitriptyline: an item-based, patient-level meta-analysis [^36eef321]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

While data on setting was unavailable for many SSRI trials, those with known setting were almost entirely conducted in outpatients whereas four out of ten amitriptyline trials were conducted in inpatients. In line with this, psychomotor retardation was markedly less prevalent at baseline in SSRI trials than in amitriptyline trials. Illustrating the possible importance of factors related to trial design for the outcome of depression trials, there were notable differences in the trajectories of the antidepressant effect of mirtazapine in trials vs amitriptyline as compared to those vs SSRIs or vs venlafaxine. This observation may have implications for the wider meta-analytical field, where including not only head-to-head studies but also indirect comparisons has increasingly become the norm.

To make the populations more homogenous with respect to presence of melancholic features, indirect comparison of amitriptyline vs SSRIs or venlafaxine including only patients with at least 2 points on the psychomotor retardation item at baseline were undertaken — though many symptoms still displayed significant baseline differences, this manoeuvre did reduce the difference in baseline rating of psychomotor retardation. Also in this subpopulation, amitriptyline outperformed SSRIs with respect to this item, as well as with respect to lack of insight and guilt. While these results are compatible with the notion that tricyclics are indeed more efficacious than SSRIs, not least in patients with melancholic features, they should, as underlined, be interpreted with due caution since they are indirect.

Amitriptyline and other tricyclic antidepressants are marred by overdose toxicity and certain tolerability issues, including anticholinergic side effects which may be particularly problematic in the elderly — that they are no longer regarded as first line treatment for depression is hence justified. However, their apparent superiority in terms of efficacy does suggest that they may still have a role to play — especially in difficult-to-treat cases of melancholic depression — and warrants further research into why they display this superiority. While in this material mirtazapine's clear superiority over SSRIs/SNRIs in promoting sleep and appetite did not translate into better antidepressant efficacy as measured by cognitive and affective symptoms of depression, mirtazapine could still hold an advantage in patients for whom sleep dysfunction and reduced appetite are major complaints.

### Impact of sedative and appetite-increasing properties on the apparent antidepressant efficacy of mirtazapine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and amitriptyline: an item-based, patient-level meta-analysis [^53ee919b]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

This study has several limitations. First, we did not consider the doses given; this may be of particular relevance for amitriptyline where doses lower than those usually regarded as optimal in terms of efficacy, e.g. 150 mg/day, have often been applied in trials, or the fact that the relatively slow dose escalation of tricyclics might impact when they are compared to drugs with a faster (or no) gradual increase in dosing. Second, differential dropout between treatments may have impacted outcomes. We used MMRM analyses to partly compensate for this since they are better at handling missing data than LOCF-ANCOVA under most scenarios. Such adjustments are, however, not perfect and it is possible that differences, e.g. in the propensity for early side effects may have impacted certain treatments unfavourably. Third, we lacked information with respect to many of the trials including aspects such as inclusion criteria, inpatients/outpatient setting, somatic and psychiatric comorbidities, where and when the study was performed etc; hence, we could not address the possible impact of such aspects on the outcome. This is of particular importance when interpreting the indirect comparisons.

In conclusion, the present study illustrates the importance of symptom specific analyses when assessing antidepressant efficacy. The superiority of mirtazapine vis-à-vis SSRIs in reducing HDRS-17-sum (Fig. 1) was entirely explained by its impact on sleep and appetite, and lack of gastrointestinal side effects (Fig. 3). With respect to reducing affective and cognitive symptoms of depression, SSRIs and venlafaxine were never inferior — and sometimes superior — to mirtazapine after six weeks of treatment. While the sedative and orexigenic properties of amitriptyline gives it a similar advantage compared to SSRIs and SNRIs when efficacy is measured by HDRS-17-sum, amitriptyline was as or more effective than mirtazapine across the board, and indirect analyses comparing SSRIs to amitriptyline were indicative of the latter possibly being more efficacious also as compared to these with regard to the affective and cognitive symptoms of depression.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^a7ee1d7c]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Antidepressant dosing in dementia — elderly patients: Low starting doses, small dose increases, and long intervals between increases are advised; citalopram is started at 5–10 mg/day and increased at several-week intervals to a maximum of 40 mg/day, and sertraline may be started at 12.5–25.0 mg/day and increased at 1–2-week intervals up to a maximum dosage of 150–200 mg/day. If initial agents are ineffective, venlafaxine can be started at 25 mg/day (extended release, 37.5 mg/day) and increased at approximately weekly intervals up to a maximum of 375 mg/day in divided doses (extended release, 225 mg/day), and if venlafaxine is prescribed, careful monitoring of blood pressure is indicated. Mirtazapine can be started at 7.5 mg at bedtime and increased by 7.5-mg or 15-mg increments to 45–60 mg at bedtime; lower dosages have been associated with sedation and appetite increase, and less sedation is found in dosages over 15 mg/day. Bupropion should be used in prescribing with caution for patients with liver dysfunction or renal impairment and for patients who develop signs of delirium; it can be started at 37.5 mg once or twice per day (sustained release, 100 mg/day) and increased slowly to a maximum dosage of 300 mg/day in divided doses (sustained release, 300 mg/day), and no more than 150 mg of immediate release bupropion should be given within any 4- hour period because of the risk of seizures. Duloxetine can be started at 20–40 mg/day and increased slowly to a maximum of 60–80 mg/day, typically in divided doses.

### Impact of sedative and appetite-increasing properties on the apparent antidepressant efficacy of mirtazapine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and amitriptyline: an item-based, patient-level meta-analysis [^ca2d3b2e]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

When introduced, mirtazapine was often claimed to be as effective as tricyclic antidepressants in severely depressed inpatients, but there has also been trials casting doubt on this notion. The present item-level analysis found amitriptyline to be numerically superior to mirtazapine with respect to most items at endpoint, and significantly so with respect to HDRS-6-sum, depressed mood, and psychomotor retardation. Moreover, the combined TCA group outperformed mirtazapine also with respect to the guilt, suicidality, and work and activities items. This study hence suggests tricyclics to be superior to mirtazapine with respect to antidepressant efficacy, and not least with respect to symptoms typical of melancholic depression.

The relative efficacy of tricyclics such as amitriptyline vis-à-vis the SSRIs has also been a long-standing issue of debate, some studies suggesting that the SSRIs may be somewhat inferior to tricyclics., The present mirtazapine-focused dataset did not include any head-to-head comparisons between amitriptyline and an SSRI, and hence cannot provide any definite conclusions regarding the relative efficacy of the two. With this caveat borne in mind, data from trials comparing amitriptyline with SSRIs were nevertheless pooled to allow for indirect comparisons. These showed SSRIs to be numerically inferior to amitriptyline with respect to almost all items at endpoint, and significantly so with respect to symptoms typical of melancholic depression, such as depressed mood, psychomotor retardation, suicidality, and inability to work.

Methods

Data acquisition

We searched for double-blind, HDRS-based, placebo- or active comparator-controlled, company-sponsored phase II-IV trials of mirtazapine for the acute-phase treatment of depression in the FDA Drug Approval Package for mirtazapineas well as in previous meta-analyses., This generated a list of 49 trials which were deemed likely to meet our inclusion criteria (Supplementary Table S1). Individual patient data for these 49 trials were requested from Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) (Rahway, NY, USA) on Jan 31, 2021, and we also asked for patient-level data from any possible additional trial matching our inclusion criteria that might have escaped our attention. The sources we used to identify trials likely to meet our inclusion criteria varied with respect to how detailed the trials were described and did not use homogeneous trial identifiers. Hence, out of 49 requested trials, two (E−1659 and Wheatley 1998; see Supplementary Table S1) turned out to be duplicates, one (E−1627) was an open-label trial and yet another (36801) could not be identified by MSD. For three other trials, which were academic but supported by grants from MSD, data could not be retrieved as they were likely not in the possession of MSD. We thus received individual patient data from 42 unique trials. Of these, two trials turned out to not have used the HDRS and were hence excluded. Two studies comparing mirtazapine to maprotiline and one comparing it to trazodone were also excluded, as were trial arms of trazodone and combined mirtazapine and paroxetine.

Included active comparators were the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) amitriptyline, clomipramine, doxepin, and imipramine, the SSRIs fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline, and the SNRI venlafaxine. Four amitriptyline trials were conducted in inpatients, five in outpatients, and one in both in- and outpatients. The clomipramine, dothiepin, and imipramine trials were all in inpatients. Seven SSRI trials were conducted in outpatients and one in both in-and outpatients; for the remaining six SSRI trials, information on setting was unavailable. One venlafaxine trial was undertaken in outpatients and the other in inpatients (Table 1).

### Antidepressant medications and weight change: a narrative review [^4a27a125]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Antidepressant medications are the first-line treatment option for moderate to severe major depressive disorder. However, most antidepressants have numerous documented adverse events, including cardiometabolic effects and weight gain, which are major public health concerns. Antidepressant agents provide varying risk of associated weight gain, including significant within-class differences. Some agents, such as mirtazapine, show significant levels of weight gain, while others, such as bupropion, demonstrate weight-loss effects. Current findings suggest the role of histamine and serotonin off-target appetite-promoting pathways in adverse weight-gain effects. Therefore, controlling for undesired weight effects is an important consideration for the selection of antidepressants.

Introduction

Clarifying if there are differences in efficacy between antidepressants may both guide prescribing clinicians and facilitate the development of refined medications. An important step was thus taken by Cipriani and co-workers when comparing 21 antidepressants in a comprehensive network meta-analysis. In this study, amitriptyline and mirtazapine were ranked first and second in terms of efficacy, i.e. above the more commonly prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). The difference between mirtazapine and the SSRIs and SNRIs was, however, small and of unlikely significance.

This outcome is of theoretical interest since amitriptyline, mirtazapine, SSRIs, and SNRIs differ in their pharmacodynamics profiles. Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant inhibiting serotonin and noradrenaline transporters (SERT and NET) and antagonizing serotonergic (e.g. 5-HT 2A), histaminergic (H 1), muscarinic, and noradrenergic (alpha 1) receptors. Mirtazapine is an antagonist at adrenergic alpha 2 -adrenoceptors, histaminergic H 1 -receptors, and serotonergic 5-HT 2A, 5-HT 2C, and 5-HT 3 receptors, with enhanced noradrenaline release following blockade of alpha 2 -adrenergic autoreceptors often suggested as the likely mechanism of action.SSRIs and SNRIs, in contrast, are not strong antagonists vis-à- vis any transmitter receptors but only act as inhibitors of SERT, and SERT plus NET, respectively.

### What is the evidence for mirtazapine in treating cancer-related symptomatology? A systematic review [^3e48cc75]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Regarding pain management, Nishihara's study results is informative for future research. Despite a high risk of bias, the significant changes might reflect a benefit from mirtazapine in treating neuropathic pain. This effect on neuropathic pain could be of great interest in the cancer population. This population often experiences neuropathic pain, either because of a direct effect of the neoplasm or side effects of the treatments. Moreover, chronic pain and especially chronic neuropathic pain are common risk factors for depressive disorders, and some authors suggest that, considering that they are part of the same symptom cluster, an improvement in neuropathic pain may lead to an improvement in sleep quality. Therefore, the effectiveness of mirtazapine in chronic neuropathic pain management could be of interest in more ways than one by treating the underlying symptom cluster of pain-depression-sleep disorders. Serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are antidepressants approved to treat neuropathic pain. Their action on neuropathic pain is not fully understood; however, it might be mediated by enhancing serotonin and noradrenaline in the spinal and supraspinal structures. Besides, tricyclic antidepressants are also approved in this indication. Like mirtazapine, tricyclic antidepressants inhibit serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake in the synapse, resulting in a central noradrenergic and serotoninergic neurotransmission increase. These shared pharmacological pathways between mirtazapine and other medications licenced for treating neuropathic pain could explain the potential effectiveness of mirtazapine for this indication.

Mirtazapine may also be an interesting antidepressant to treat multiple symptoms because of its effects on appetite and weight. Mirtazapine's side effects might be of great interest, particularly because malnutrition is a cause of treatment intolerance and shortens the life expectancy of advanced cancer patients. For these reasons, mirtazapine may be the preferred option when treating depression in cancer patients. To date, evidence for the use of mirtazapine to improve weight gain and appetite is lacking but studies are currently ongoing to address this.

Another interesting symptom for which no treatment is licensed in Europe is breathlessness. Evidence is lacking to support the use of mirtazapine in alleviating breathlessness; however, some pilot studies have shown encouraging results in alleviating breathlessness in advanced lung disease conditions, including lung cancers. Mirtazapine appears to be a promising candidate to pursue, but definitive randomized controlled trials are required to determine its efficacy and safety in this setting.

### Efficacy of mirtazapine for the treatment of fibromyalgia without concomitant depression: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase IIa study in Japan [^28829cba]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of mirtazapine in Japanese patients with fibromyalgia (FM), a parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase IIa study was conducted at 57 sites between November 2012 and February 2014. Patients aged 20 to 64 years who met the American College of Rheumatology 1990 diagnostic FM criteria and had stably high pain scores during a placebo run-in period were randomly assigned (1:1) by a computer-generated allocation sequence (block size 4) to receive mirtazapine orally (15 mg/d for 1 week and then 30 mg/d) or matching placebo for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in mean numerical rating scale (NRS) pain score from baseline to endpoint (week 12 or early discontinuation). Of the 430 patients randomized (n = 215 each group), 422 (n = 211 each group) were analyzed for the primary endpoint. At the study endpoint, mirtazapine caused a significantly greater reduction in the mean NRS pain score compared with placebo (difference, 0.44; 95% confidence interval, -0.72 to -0.17; P = 0.0018). The reduction by mirtazapine remained significantly greater compared with placebo from week 6 onward. More patients treated with mirtazapine had their NRS pain score reduced by ≥ 30% from baseline (45.5% vs 30.8%). Mirtazapine also improved pain-related quality of life assessed by the Japanese version of the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire and the Short-Form 36 Questionnaire. Adverse events were more common with mirtazapine than placebo (68.8% vs 56.7%), including somnolence (32.1% vs 7.4%), weight gain (17.7% vs 0.9%), and increased appetite (11.6% vs 3.3%). In conclusion, mirtazapine was an effective and safe treatment for Japanese patients with FM.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: a proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^487d1699]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Mirtazapine is available in 7.5 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg tablets and a 15 mg dissolvable wafer. We recommend starting with a dosage of 3.75 mg at bedtime. We then increase the dosage by 3.75 mg each week, giving all medication at bedtime, until the symptoms of anxiety are "much improved" or "very much improved"; the patient develops interfering side effects (see above), that limit further dose escalation; or we reach a maximum dose of 45 mg/day. Mirtazapine can be given in two divided doses if clinically indicated. Common side effects of mirtazapine include drowsiness, increased appetite, weight gain, and irritability.

Buspirone is a 5-HT 1A receptor partial agonist and dopamine (D 2) antagonist. Buspirone is FDA-approved for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in adults. To date, there are no published RCTs of buspirone for the treatment of anxiety in ASD. In an open-label trial, 22 children and adolescents with ASD (ages 6–17 years) received buspirone (15–45 mg/day) for 6–8 weeks. Nine patients (41%) showed a "marked response," and seven participants (32%) showed a "moderate response," addressing target symptoms of anxiety and irritability as measured with the CGI-I. In a retrospective chart review including 31 ASD youth (ages 8–17 years) without co-occurring ID or impaired language skills, treatment with buspirone for co-occurring anxiety disorders led to 18 of the subjects (58%) rated as "much improved" or "very much improved" on the CGI-I. Nine of the subjects (29%) were "minimally improved". There are very few clinically significant side effects with buspirone. Possible side effects include a sensation of dizziness, sedation, behavioral activation, and increased appetite and weight gain.

### Impact of sedative and appetite-increasing properties on the apparent antidepressant efficacy of mirtazapine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and amitriptyline: an item-based, patient-level meta-analysis [^578ad53d]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig. 4

Legend: The green centre line represents no difference between amitriptyline and the SSRIs and venlafaxine, respectively. Bars pointing towards the outer circle favour amitriptyline, where a bar reaching the outer circle would correspond to a mean difference (MD) of +0.4 points. Bars pointing towards the inner circle favour SSRIs and venlafaxine, respectively, where a bar reaching the inner circle would correspond to a mean difference (MD) of +0.4 points. ∗ = p < 0.05, ∗∗ = p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ = p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗ = p < 0.0001.

When interpreting the indirect comparisons, it should be noted that design and patient characteristics in trials with one comparator may differ systematically from those with another comparator and that this could impact outcomes. In this vein, baseline rating of, e.g. psychomotor retardation, which is a key feature of melancholic depression, was higher in amitriptyline trials than in SSRI trials (Supplementary Table S2) which is in line with the former more often having been undertaken in inpatients (Table 1). Notably, the trajectory of response to mirtazapine in trials with different comparators indeed differed markedly (Supplementary Figure S4) usually following the trajectory of the comparator (not shown). However, endpoint outcomes were largely the same for mirtazapine regardless of comparator.

To assess if differences with respect to prevalence of psychomotor retardation in the different trial populations could explain the difference observed between amitriptyline and SSRIs, the indirect comparisons were repeated after exclusion of patients rated less than two with respect to this item at baseline (Supplementary Figure S5). At endpoint, amitriptyline again outperformed SSRIs with respect to HDRS-17-sum (ES: 0.32, p = 0.0005) and HDRS-6-sum ES 0.26; p = 0.0044) and also with respect to, e.g. depressed mood, guilt, suicidality, work and activities, psychomotor retardation, and lack of insight.

At week one, the only significant difference between mirtazapine and amitriptyline was that somatic anxiety was rated higher in the amitriptyline group. At week six, amitriptyline outperformed mirtazapine with respect to reduction in depressed mood and psychomotor retardation (Fig. 3). As a group, all tricyclics combined outperformed mirtazapine with respect to depressed mood, guilt, suicidality, early and middle insomnia, work and activities, and psychomotor retardation (Supplementary Figure S2).

Indirect comparisons

An indirect comparison of amitriptyline vs SSRIs found amitriptyline to outperform SSRIs at endpoint with respect to HDRS-17-sum (ES 0.28; p < 0.0001), HDRS-6-sum (ES 0.13, p = 0.044) and the following individual symptoms: suicidality, all three insomnia items, work and activities, psychomotor retardation, somatic anxiety, gastrointestinal symptoms, general somatic symptoms, sexual dysfunction, and weight loss (Fig. 4). An indirect comparison of SSRIs vs all TCAs combined resulted in similar outcomes (Supplementary Figure S3). Comparing venlafaxine with amitriptyline revealed fewer significant differences — while amitriptyline-treated patients rated lower with respect to all insomnia items, the gastrointestinal symptom item, and the weight loss item, venlafaxine outperformed amitriptyline with respect to reduction in psychomotor agitation (Fig. 4).

### Mirtazapine in cancer-associated anorexia and cachexia: a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial [^a182bd5a]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Few pharmacological interventions are available for cancer-associated anorexia and cachexia. Mirtazapine has been suggested for use in cancer-associated anorexia and cachexia.

Objectives

This study was conducted to assess the efficacy and tolerability of mirtazapine in cancer-associated anorexia and cachexia.

Methods

A double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial. The study included 120 incurable solid tumour patients with anorexia (appetite loss ≥ 4 on 0–10 scale, 10 = maximum appetite loss), cachexia (> 5% body weight loss over 6 months or > 2% plus body mass index < 20) and depression score ≤ 3 on 0–6 scale (6 = extreme feelings of depression). Patients were 1:1 randomized to receive mirtazapine 15mg daily at night for 8 weeks or placebo. The primary endpoint was change in appetite from baseline to day 28. Other outcomes included changes in quality-of-life, fatigue, depressive symptoms, body weight, lean body mass, handgrip strength, inflammatory markers, adverse events and survival.

Results

48 (80%) patients in the mirtazapine arm and 52 (87%) in the placebo were assessable for the 1ry endpoint. Appetite score increased significantly with mirtazapine as well as with placebo (P < 0.0001 each). The increase in appetite score did not differ significantly between the two arms in the per-protocol and intention-to-treat analysis (P = 0.472 and 0.462, respectively). Mirtazapine was associated with significantly less increase in depressive symptoms and higher prevalence of somnolence. The change in other outcomes did not differ significantly between mirtazapine and placebo.

Conclusion

Mirtazapine 15mg at night for 28 days is no better than placebo in improving the appetite of incurable solid tumor patients with cancer-associated anorexia and cachexia.

Second, analogous MMRM models were used for the comparison of each treatment vs mirtazapine with respect to all individual HDRS-17-items at week one and week six.

Third, prompted by item-level differences in response, as well as by differing responses with respect to HDRS-17 as compared to HDRS-6 for SSRIs and mirtazapine, respectively, we conducted two follow-up analyses using the same MMRM specification. In the first of these, we excluded sleep symptoms (items 4 to 6), appetite (item 12) and weight (item 16). In the second, we excluded the aforementioned items as well as item 11 (somatic anxiety).

Fourth, indirect comparisons of amitriptyline vs SSRIs, venlafaxine, or the combination of SSRIs and venlafaxine were undertaken using the same outcome measures and model specifications as in the previous analysis; however, the fixed factor for trial was omitted since no study contributed data on both amitriptyline and SSRIs/venlafaxine. SSRIs were likewise indirectly compared with all TCAs combined. Since the inclusion of a placebo arm is known to impact the outcome of depression trials, and since placebo arms were more common in amitriptyline trials (five out of ten) than in SSRI trials (one in fourteen) and venlafaxine trials (zero out of two), trials including placebo were excluded from these analyses. Since week one data coverage was poor for the remaining studies, week two data was used to assess early differences. Moreover, since presence of psychomotor retardation at baseline was more common in the amitriptyline group than in the SSRI group — probably reflecting that amitriptyline trials were more often conducted in inpatients — the analyses of SSRIs vs amitriptyline or vs all TCAs combined were repeated after making the population more homogenous in this regard by excluding patients not displaying a score of at least two on the HDRS psychomotor retardation item (rated 0–4).

### Efficacy of mirtazapine for prevention of depressive relapse: a placebo-controlled double-blind trial of recently remitted high-risk patients [^ad0d0fb9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The necessity of antidepressant continuation-phase therapy following acute-phase response has resulted in the need to characterize the longer-term efficacy and safety of all new medications. Previous studies using "extension" protocols suggest that mirtazapine has sustained antidepressant effects. The current study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of up to 1 year of mirtazapine therapy, using a more rigorous, randomized, placebo-controlled discontinuation design.

Method

An intent-to-treat sample of 410 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for moderate-to-severe recurrent or chronic major depressive episodes began 8 to 12 weeks of open-label therapy with mirtazapine (flexibly titrated, 15–45 mg/day). Thereafter, 156 fully remitted patients (according to Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scores) were randomly assigned to receive 40 weeks of double-blind continuation-phase therapy with either mirtazapine or placebo.

Results

Mirtazapine therapy reduced the rate of depressive relapse by more than half, with 43.8% of patients relapsing on treatment with placebo as compared with 19.7% of the mirtazapine-treated patients. The discontinuation rate due to adverse events was 11.8% for active mirtazapine therapy versus 2.5% for placebo. Although weight gain was significantly greater in the group receiving active medication during the double-blind phase (p = .001), patients taking mirtazapine gained only 1.4 kg (3.1 lb) across the 40 weeks of continuation therapy, and there was no difference in the rates of weight gain as a newonset adverse event.

Conclusion

Continuation-phase therapy with mirtazapine is effective and well tolerated.

### Consistent differential effects of bupropion and mirtazapine in major depression [^70fdec68]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with major depression exhibit heterogeneous symptom profiles and variable responses to antidepressants. Most clinical trials rely on aggregate outcomes such as total symptom severity or remission rates, which often obscure meaningful differences in treatment response.

Methods

We applied the Supervised Varimax (SV) algorithm to identify outcome dimensions that maximally differentiate antidepressants based on symptom-level effects. We analyzed all relevant levels of the STAR*D trial and validated findings in the independent CO-MED study. We assessed statistical significance using permutation testing with familywise error rate (FWER) correction.

Results

SV consistently identified interpretable and statistically significant differences between bupropion, mirtazapine, and other antidepressants. In STAR*D, bupropion monotherapy produced greater improvement in hypersomnia than venlafaxine in Levels 2 and 2 A (n = 686, difference = 0.384, p FWER = 0.007). Bupropion augmentation outperformed buspirone augmentation for increased weight, increased appetite, and fatigue in Level 2 (n = 520, difference = -0.322, p FWER = 0.005). Mirtazapine monotherapy outperformed nortriptyline for insomnia, decreased weight, and decreased appetite in Level 3 (n = 214, difference = 0.401, p FWER = 0.022), and venlafaxine with mirtazapine similarly outperformed tranylcypromine in Level 4 (n = 102, difference = -0.722, p FWER = 0.004). In CO-MED, escitalopram with bupropion and venlafaxine with mirtazapine demonstrated complementary symptom-specific benefits (n = 640, difference = -0.302, p FWER = 0.022).

Conclusion

Bupropion is most effective for hypersomnia, increased weight, increased appetite, or fatigue, while mirtazapine is preferable for insomnia, decreased weight, or decreased appetite. SV enables statistically rigorous, symptom-level differentiation using only treatment assignment, offering a scalable and clinically aligned framework for guiding antidepressant selection from individual clinical trials.

### Mirtazapine (Remeron) [^a3ecf01f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of REMERON as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in 4 placebo-controlled, 6-week trials in adult outpatients meeting DSM-III criteria for major depressive disorder. Patients were titrated with REMERON from a dose range of 5 mg to 35 mg/day. The mean mirtazapine dose for patients who completed these 4 studies ranged from 21 to 32 mg/day. Overall, these studies demonstrated REMERON to be superior to placebo on at least 3 of the following 4 measures: 21-Item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) total score; HDRS Depressed Mood Item; CGI Severity score; and Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Superiority of REMERON over placebo was also found for certain factors of the HDRS, including anxiety/somatization factor and sleep disturbance factor.

Examination of age and gender subsets of the population did not reveal any differential responsiveness on the basis of these subgroupings.

In a longer-term study, patients meeting (DSM-IV) criteria for major depressive disorder who had responded during an initial 8 to 12 weeks of acute treatment on REMERON were randomized to continuation of REMERON or placebo for up to 40 weeks of observation for relapse. Response during the open phase was defined as having achieved a HAM-D 17 total score of ≤ 8 and a CGI-Improvement score of 1 or 2 at 2 consecutive visits beginning with week 6 of the 8 to 12 weeks in the open-label phase of the study. Relapse during the double-blind phase was determined by the individual investigators. Patients receiving continued REMERON treatment experienced significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 40 weeks compared to those receiving placebo. This pattern was demonstrated in both male and female patients.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^687ba8c7]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder — mirtazapine has suggestive efficacy with notable weight gain: an open-label first phase with double-blind discontinuation suggests that mirtazapine may be effective for OCD in patients who have not received SRI treatment or have not responded to only one adequate SRI trial, but the small sample size (15 treatment-naive and 15 not responding to exactly one adequate SRI trial) makes results suggestive rather than strong; significant weight gain occurred in more than 30% of patients in the first 12 weeks, a small pilot study provides slight support, and additional double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group trials are indicated.

### Mirtazapine and weight gain in avoidant and restrictive food intake disorder [^e07f8733]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Avoidant and restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is a newly classified disorder in the DSM-5 that describes a pattern of restrictive eating across the lifespan that results in significant weight loss, nutritional deficiency, dependence on enteral feeding or nutritional supplements, or marked interference in psychosocial functioning. 1 Currently, there are no evidence-based treatment approaches or medications for this disorder. 2 We have administered a range of psychoactive medications to those with ARFID in our treatment program in an attempt to find an effective medication. One medication of interest has been mirtazapine because it promotes appetite and weight gain, decreases nausea and vomiting, and improves gastric emptying. Although mirtazapine is an off-label approach in a pediatric population and carries a black box warning for an increased risk of suicide, it is an effective treatment for depression and anxiety symptoms in adults and is generally well tolerated. 3,4 There are no studies to date reporting on the use of mirtazapine in patients with ARFID.

### An open-label, crossover trial of mirtazapine (15 and 30 mg) in cancer patients with pain and other distressing symptoms [^d204c4fa]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2002). Low credibility.

We performed a pilot open-label, crossover trial of mirtazapine (15 and 30 mg at night) in advanced cancer patients with pain and other distressing symptoms. Twenty patients completed the trial and sixteen dropped out. Following a baseline assessment, patients completed a one-week observation period and were then randomized to a starting dose of either 15 mg or 30 mg of mirtazapine given at bedtime. After three weeks, subjects were switched to the alternate dose and followed by an additional three-week period, completing the treatment. The average age of the completers was 60.2 years and consisted of 7 women and 13 men. The majority were Caucasian (n = 18, 90%) and married (n = 18, 90%). The drop-out group did not significantly differ from the completers based on age, gender, race, marital status, or tumor type. We examined the impact of mirtazapine therapy on patients' levels of depression, pain intensity, appetite, insomnia, weight, and overall quality of life. A series of repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted to compare the completers' status at Weeks 1, 4, and 7 compared to baseline and to examine the interaction with starting dose and baseline observations. Scores on the Zung self-rating Depression Scale (F = 8.20, P < 0.05) and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General Measure (F = 5.73, P < 0.05) were significantly improved at study end (Week 7) and were not dependent on mirtazapine dosage. Patients' weights were significantly higher at both Week 4 and Week 7, independent of dosage. Trend level differences were found on Memorial Pain Assessment Card items for pain, pain relief, and mood and on numeric rating scales measuring nausea, anxiety, insomnia, and appetite. This open-label pilot study suggests that mirtazapine may be effective for improving multiple symptoms, depression and quality of life in patients with advanced cancer. A controlled trial of this drug would be valuable.

### Mirtazapine for gastrointestinal and neuropsychological symptoms in older adults with irritable bowel syndrome [^fa411b90]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
Mirtazapine mechanism of action.

Thus, we discuss below the potential for off-label use of mirtazapine for the myriad GI and neuropsychological symptoms in older adults with IBS, using evidence from studies on the use of mirtazapine in other related conditions with symptoms similar to IBS.

Mirtazapine undergoes extensive liver metabolism primarily via the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Achieving steady-state concentrations takes about 4 days in adults and 6 days in the elderly when dosed once daily. In vitro studies indicate that mirtazapine is unlikely to result in clinically significant drug–drug interactions. Common ADEs include dry mouth, sedation, increased appetite, and weight gain. Notably, unlike SSRIs, mirtazapine does not cause sexual dysfunction.

Mirtazapine is less likely to cause hypertension, tachycardia, and tremor compared to TCAs. Compared to SSRIs, mirtazapine is more likely to cause weight gain, increased appetite, salivation, somnolence, and fatigue, but less likely to cause flatulence, sweating, sexual dysfunction, tremor, nausea, vomiting, sleep disturbances, and diarrhea. Compared to the serotonin–noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine, mirtazapine is more likely to cause fatigue but less likely to cause sleep disturbances, sweating, and constipation. Compared to trazodone, mirtazapine is more likely to cause weight gain and increased appetite. Approximately 70% of patients on mirtazapine experienced at least one adverse event, similar to other antidepressants.

Mechanism of actions of mirtazapine underlying its roles in IBS

The expression of certain receptors can be upregulated in IBS, specifically histamine H1 and H2 receptors. Serotonin is an important neuromodulator in the gut–brain axis, playing major roles in modulating the functions of the ENS and GI smooth muscles and vasculature via the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1C, 5-HT2, 5-HT3, and 5-HT4 receptors, which are abundantly located throughout the GI system. – Patients with IBS-D may have substantial dysregulation of various serotonin receptors and sub-receptors and impairment in serotonin uptake and release. – For example, stimulating 5-HT2 receptors in the gut leads to contraction of GI smooth muscle, whereas the opposite effect occurs when 5-HT1 receptors are stimulated. Mirtazapine enhances the function of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1C receptors while blocking 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors. – In particular, 5-HT3 receptors, which play a major role in gut function and IBS pathogenesis, are found in enteric motor neurons, peripheral afferents, and the vomiting center. – Blocking 5-HT3 receptors reduces pain and decreases colonic transit and small intestinal secretion, thereby decreasing diarrhea. –

Mirtazapine is an antidepressant and antianxiety agent that acts by blocking presynaptic α2-adrenergic autoreceptors and α2-adrenergic heteroreceptors and by antagonizing 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors, enhancing the effects of 5-HT1A-mediated serotonergic transmission. Mirtazapine also has effects on other subtypes of 5-HT1 receptors. It has a high affinity for central and peripheral H1 receptors and acts as a potent antagonist of H1 receptors (Figure 1). Commonly reported side effects include dry mouth, somnolence, hyperphagia, increased appetite, body weight gain, and transient somnolence, which are associated with the antihistaminic (H1) activity of mirtazapine at low doses. Mirtazapine is FDA approved for major depressive disorder, with the advantages of a faster onset of action than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It is commonly used off-label to treat comorbid anxiety, insomnia, and appetite loss, especially when they coexist with depression.

### What is the evidence for mirtazapine in treating cancer-related symptomatology? A systematic review [^d743bbc3]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Evidence from randomised-controlled trials

Two studies used randomised-controlled designs, although mirtazapine was not compared with a placebo in either. The studies assessed the effectiveness of mirtazapine on two different symptoms: emesis and pain.

Cao et al.'s study aimed to assess the effectiveness of mirtazapine in addition to usual anti-emetic therapies in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced emesis. The study included 95 breast cancer patients undergoing cisplatin chemotherapy. The intervention group received mirtazapine in addition to aprepitan, a 5HT3 receptor antagonist and dexamethasone 7.5 mg. The control group received the same medications except mirtazapine. Response was assessed as "complete response to vomiting" (no emesis and no rescue treatments) and "complete control" (defined as no emesis, no rescue treatment and no more than grade 1 nausea). In the first cycle, delayed and overall complete response rates were significantly higher with mirtazapine (78.3 versus 49% p = 0.003, and 58.7 versus 34.7% p = 0.019). Similar results were observed in the 3rd cycle. The study closed early due to slow enrolment, and the interpretation of results is limited by a small sample size.

Nishihara et al.'s study compared antidepressant drugs used as adjuvants with pregabalin and opioids for intractable painful bone metastases in mixed cancer types. The authors compared pregabalin 50 mg three times daily, pregabalin 25 mg three times daily combined with mirtazapine 7.5 mg twice daily and pregabalin 25 mg three times daily combined with imipramine 5 mg twice daily. Authors also recorded the average use of opioids in the three arms. The trial included 25 patients treated for 15 days; a numerical rating scale was used to evaluate average intensity of pain and intensity of paroxysmal pain over the past 24 h. The results found a clinically important difference over 2 in the total pain score intensity and in the paroxysmal pain intensity from the 1st day of use in all 3 arms of the trial. This decrease was significantly higher in the arm with mirtazapine and imipramine than in the arm with pregabalin only, and results were higher in the mirtazapine arm than the imipramine arm during the first day of treatment. There was no difference in the daily opioid dose for any of the arms.

Poor appetite and weight loss

Antidepressants are known to influence weight gain and appetite stimulation, which in certain patient populations may be considered a side effect but in elderly individuals can be a beneficial effect of treatment. Atypical antidepressants like mirtazapine have demonstrated the benefit of not only improving mood but also promoting weight gain. Studies indicate an average weight gain of 1.74–2.59 kg with long-term (> 4 months) and short-term (4–12 weeks) use of mirtazapine, respectively. The precise mechanism by which mirtazapine restores appetite is not fully understood, although it may involve acceleration of gastric emptying possibly due to 5-HT2C antagonism/inverse agonism. In addition, the antihistaminic effects of mirtazapine could contribute to increased appetite.

In a study involving women diagnosed with depressive episodes, monotherapy with mirtazapine over a 6-week period significantly increased body weight, body fat mass, and leptin concentration. An open-label clinical trial in healthy men showed that mirtazapine increased hunger and appetite for sweets, accompanied by a preference for carbohydrate substrate and increased insulin and C-peptide release in response to meals.

Furthermore, an open-label single-institution phase II trial of mirtazapine in non-depressed patients with cachexia and anorexia related to underlying cancer reported that 24% of patients gained at least 1 kg after 4 weeks of therapy. Patients also experienced reductions in fatigue, nausea, and early satiety, which correlated with the observed weight gain. These findings underscore mirtazapine's potential role in addressing weight loss and poor appetite associated with IBS.

Pruritus/skin atopy

IBS has been noted to be associated with atopic dermatitis in patients. The literature extensively describes the bidirectional association between IBS and pruritus/skin atopy. –

Mirtazapine has demonstrated benefits in the treatment of pruritus. An 8-week prospective, open-label, cross-over randomized clinical trial was conducted on 77 hemodialysis patients with chronic pruritus. Patients were treated with mirtazapine (15 mg per day) or gabapentin (100 mg per day) for 2 weeks in each treatment period. Sixty-one patients completed both treatment periods, and improvement in pruritus severity was significantly greater during the mirtazapine treatment period compared to the gabapentin treatment period (p < 0.001). Mirtazapine's mechanism involves antagonizing α2-adrenergic receptors, making it effective in managing chronic pruritus refractory to typical first-line therapies.

### Management of cancer cachexia: ASCO guideline [^1ba9564d]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Cancer cachexia — biomarkers, body composition, and investigational therapies are highlighted as research priorities, noting that evaluation of cancer cachexia biomarkers may allow identification of critical time points for potential intervention and effective markers for surveillance of cachexia-related characteristics, such as appetite; additionally, cancer cachexia, specifically sarcopenia, has a demonstrated relationship with treatment-related toxicity, and researchers evaluating novel cancer treatments should recognize that changes in body composition may help predict dose-limiting toxicities, with incorporation of longitudinal body composition changes as a secondary end point across cancer trials that may promote early identification of patients at highest risk of treatment-related toxicity; optimal approaches may involve single or combination strategies, including targeted pharmacologic agents, nutritional support, and exercise, with promising agents including anamorelin and olanzapine, while mirtazapine has been recognized clinically as an appetite enhancer with a phase II study suggesting improvement in appetite and weight gain in approximately one-third of patients but lacking information on impact on cancer treatment, and reports of appetite enhancement by medical cannabis may prompt additional research.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^699b2f17]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Amphetamine-type stimulant use disorder (ATS) mirtazapine recommendations state that for patients with ATS use disorder, clinicians can consider prescribing mirtazapine to promote reduced use of ATS (Low certainty, Conditional Recommendation), and clinicians can give mirtazapine additional consideration for patients with co-occurring depressive disorders, as this medication can also treat depression (Low certainty, Conditional Recommendation). Mirtazapine is FDA-approved to treat depression, may also help treat anxiety and improve sleep quality, and has no known potential for misuse, and these benefits may be tempered by side effects such as weight gain, drowsiness, and metabolic issues; while the evidence is relatively weak, the CGC determined that, because there are few medication options available, mirtazapine may be preferable to no treatment at all, particularly for MSM.

### Efficacy and safety of mirtazapine in fibromyalgia syndrome patients: a randomized placebo-controlled pilot study [^36f8301e]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Data from an open-label trial suggest that mirtazapine might prove useful in treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS).

Objective

To obtain preliminary efficacy data of mirtazapine for estimation of sample size requirements for a Phase 2 clinical trial in FMS.

Methods

This 13-week randomized controlled trial compared the effects of mirtazapine 15 mg/day, mirtazapine 30 mg/day, and placebo in 40 patients with FMS. The primary outcomes were change in Pain Visual Analog Scale (PVAS) and proportion of pain responders (≥ 30% PVAS reduction). Secondary outcomes included scores from the Jenkins Sleep Scale (JSS), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), Patient Global Assessment, and self-reported adverse events.

Results

Significant within-group PVAS reductions from baseline were observed in all 3 groups, with the greatest improvement in the mirtazapine 30-mg group (p < 0.005); between-group difference was not significant. The proportion of pain responders did not meet significance criteria (66.67% for mirtazapine 30 mg, 50% for mirtazapine 15 mg, 41.67% for placebo). Significant within-group improvement in JSS scores was seen for mirtazapine 30 mg (p < 0.01) and mirtazapine 15 mg (p < 0.05). Between-group comparison achieved significance for JSS item 3, waking several times per night (p < 0.05). On the PGIC, 72.73% felt better with both mirtazapine dosages compared with 50% for placebo. Within-group FIQ responses indicated improvement in only mirtazapine-treated groups, whereas within-group improvement for HAM-D and Patient Global Assessment was observed in all groups. Based on our findings, the sample size requirement (80% power, 5% type I error) should be 83 per group to detect PVAS change difference between mirtazapine 30 mg and placebo. Common mirtazapine-related adverse events were increased appetite and weight gain.

Conclusions

Patients with FMS taking mirtazapine exhibited within-group significant improvement in most of the measured outcomes. Between-group analysis was predictably compromised by the small sample size. Mirtazapine was well tolerated. Further study with a larger sample size is likely to be useful.

Medication management and dosing for anxiety disorders

To date, there has been only one published RCT of a medication, mirtazapine, for the treatment of anxiety in youth with ASD. Mirtazapine is a central presynaptic α 2 -adrenergic antagonist that increases norepinephrine release, which results in increased synaptic serotonin (5-HT) levels facilitated by the stimulation of α 1 -adrenergic receptors on 5-HT neuron cell bodies. Mirtazapine also blocks 5-HT 2 and 5-HT 3 receptors, a mechanism likely responsible for the anxiolytic and hypnotic effects of the drug. Mirtazapine is FDA-approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults. The study was a 10-week RCT comparing mirtazapine (mean dosage = 41.8 ± 5.2 mg/day) with placebo in youth with ASD ages 5–17 years. Thirty subjects were randomly assigned to mirtazapine versus placebo in a 2:1 ratio, with the CGI-I and the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) as the primary outcome measures. A non-significant trend toward superiority of mirtazapine compared with placebo was observed with the PARS (effect size = 0.63). For 47% of participants assigned to mirtazapine, symptoms of anxiety were considered "much improved" (CGI-I = 2) or "very much improved" (CGI-I = 1) compared to 20% of those assigned to placebo. The most common adverse effects of mirtazapine were sedation/drowsiness, appetite increase/weight gain, and irritability; however, there was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of adverse effects between mirtazapine and placebo.

A subset of patients with functional dyspepsia (FD) present with early satiation and weight loss, for which there are no established therapeutic options. We investigated the efficacy of mirtazapine (an antidepressant and antagonist of the histamine receptor H1, the α2 adrenergic receptor, and the serotonin receptors 5-HT2C and 5-HT-3) in patients with FD and weight loss.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled pilot trial that studied 34 patients with FD (29 women; mean age, 35.9 ± 2.3 years) with weight loss > 10% of original body weight (mean loss, 12.4 ± 2.3 kg) without depression or anxiety. After a run-in period, patients were randomly assigned to groups given placebo (n = 17) or mirtazapine 15 mg each day for 8 weeks (n = 17) in a double-blind manner. Subjects were evaluated during a 2-week baseline and 8-week treatment for dyspepsia symptom severity, quality of life (on the basis of the Nepean Dyspepsia Index), and gastrointestinal-specific anxiety; they were given a nutrient challenge test and weighed. Data were analyzed by using linear mixed models, followed by planned contrasts with adaptive step-down Bonferroni multiple testing correction.

Results

Two patients in each group dropped out. At weeks 4 and 8, mirtazapine significantly reduced mean dyspepsia symptom severity scores compared with week 0 (P = 0.003 and P = 0.017, respectively); there was no significant reduction in the placebo group (P > .37 for weeks 4 and 8). The difference in change from week 0 between mirtazapine and placebo showed a trend with a large effect size at week 4 (P = 0.059) that was not significant at week 8 (P = 0.55). However, improvements from week 0 to weeks 4 and 8 were significantly larger in the mirtazapine group than placebo group for early satiation, quality of life, gastrointestinal-specific anxiety, weight, and nutrient tolerance (mostly with large effect sizes).

Conclusions

In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, mirtazapine significantly improved early satiation, quality of life, gastrointestinal-specific anxiety, nutrient tolerance, and weight loss in patients with FD. ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT01240096.

### Therapeutic effects, side effects, and adverse effects of neuropsychiatric drugs in the context of treating cancer-related anorexia with olanzapine and mirtazapine [^514afb28]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Drugs have actions that may be classified as therapeutic effects and side effects; side effects are actions that do not contribute to therapeutic benefit. Some side effects are neutral; others, experienced as undesirable or unpleasant, are recorded as adverse effects. Some drug actions are therapeutic for some disorders and adverse for others; or therapeutic during acute illness and adverse during maintenance treatment. As an example, anticholinergic action may be adverse when a tricyclic antidepressant is used to treat depression but therapeutic when the drug is used to treat irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea. In clinical practice, side or adverse effects of a drug may be leveraged to manage troublesome symptoms. As an example, the sedative effect of a low dose of trazodone may be useful for some patients with insomnia. With this background, studies have examined whether the increase in appetite and weight associated with olanzapine and mirtazapine may be effective against anorexia and cachexia associated with cancer and cancer chemotherapy. The subject is important because cachexia may be present in 30%-50% of patients with cancer (with higher prevalence in patients with more advanced cancer) and because the presence of cachexia is associated with a higher risk of disease progression and mortality. Many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have examined pharmacologic interventions such as progestins, corticosteroids, anamorelin, and medical cannabis for cancer related cachexia; most results have been disappointing. A recent RCT found that olanzapine (2.5 mg/d for 12 weeks) improved appetite, weight, other nutritional parameters, and quality of life in patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancer treated with chemotherapy. Another RCT, however, found that mirtazapine (30 mg/d for 8 weeks) brought no nutritional or anthropometric gain in patients with cancer and anorexia. It is concluded that olanzapine but not mirtazapine merits further investigation in patients with cancer who have anorexia and cachexia.

### Mirtazapine for treatment of depression and comorbidities in Alzheimer disease [^63300b0e]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Depression in patients with Alzheimer disease is a treatable cause of functional decline, caregiver burden, and mortality. It is often associated with severe weight loss, insomnia, and anxiety. These symptoms independently and collaboratively further worsen the prognosis of these vulnerable patients. An antidepressant medication with good adverse effect profile and salutary effects on these comorbid symptoms may be of significant therapeutic value in these patients.

Objective

To describe the role of mirtazapine in the treatment of depressed Alzheimer patients with comorbid weight loss, insomnia, and anxiety.

Case Summary

Three patients with dementia and depression complicated by weight loss, insomnia, and anxiety were treated with mirtazapine at an outpatient memory loss clinic of a university hospital.

Discussion

Despite the persistence of memory loss, the patients experienced a prompt and sustained response to mirtazapine. There was a complete remission of poor appetite, weight loss, sleep disturbances, and anxiety. Other depression symptoms, including sad mood, anhedonia, and energy level, were also substantially improved.

Conclusions

The clinical response of our patients underscores the usefulness of mirtazapine in the treatment of the comorbid symptoms of weight loss, insomnia, and anxiety. The effectiveness of mirtazapine in depressed Alzheimer patents may be a reflection of its enhancement of brain serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission. The usefulness of mirtazapine in depressed Alzheimer patients merits further study in a large randomized, controlled, clinically comparative trial.

### Mirtazapine is associated with shorter hospital stay in pediatric avoidant restrictive food intake disorder – A Retrospective chart review [^e7e2bc01]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Current therapeutic interventions include cognitive‐behavioral and family‐based psychotherapy, including desensitization to avoided foods in the outpatient setting (Kambanis et al.). However, when the illness is severe, treatment may include inpatient medical stabilization and nutritional rehabilitation using a nasogastric feeding tube. Especially, a multidisciplinary approach shows promise in treating individuals with ARFID (Crone et al.).

The neurobiology of ARFID remains unclear, and no medication has been approved for its treatment. Despite this lack of approved medications, patients with ARFID are frequently treated with psychoactive medications, while research on psychopharmacological treatments in this population is lacking (Lin et al; Brewerton and D'Agostino; Muratore and Attia). One medication of interest is the tetracyclic antidepressant mirtazapine, which improves low appetite, decreases nausea and vomiting, and supports gastric emptying, typical associated symptoms of ARFID (Bhattacharjee et al; Iglesias‐Escabi et al; Lalani et al.). A hypothesis‐driven article comparing psychoactive medications and their potential use in ARFID suggested that mirtazapine could be an effective treatment in this population (Gray et al.). Mirtazapine is an antagonist at serotonin 2A, 2C, and 3, alpha‐1 and 2A adrenergic, and histamine H1 receptors, and is an agonist at kappa opioid receptors (Wishart et al.). Mirtazapine leads to the release of norepinephrine and serotonin, neurotransmitters that affect mood and anxiety, while its kappa opioid receptor agonism has analgesic effects (Wishart et al; Anttila and Leinonen). Mirtazapine is FDA‐approved for adults with major depressive disorder. It is often used off‐label for insomnia, anxiety, post‐traumatic stress, or obsessive‐compulsive disorders due to its sedative, antiemetic, anxiolytic, and appetite‐stimulant effects (Jilani et al.). A few case reports have been published that suggested that mirtazapine could be beneficial for ARFID treatment (Naguy et al; Naviaux). Other small studies have investigated the second‐generation antipsychotic olanzapine (Wishart et al.), reporting benefits for weight restoration and improvement in anxiety and depression (Brewerton and D'Agostino; Dolman et al.). A retrospective chart review on serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) with and without added hydroxyzine showed both approaches had comparable outcomes at the end of treatment (Mahr et al.). Taken together, research on psychopharmacological interventions in ARFID is largely lacking.

### Pharmacological management of obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^21cbea1c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — antidepressant selection and weight effects recommends a shared decision-making process that provides patients with quantitative estimates of the expected weight effect when antidepressant therapy is indicated (1|⊕⊕⊕○), noting that the expected length of treatment should also be considered. Evidence indicates heterogeneous weight effects: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine and sertraline have been associated with weight loss during acute treatment (4–12 wk) and weight neutrality in the maintenance (> 4 mo) phase, with no significant effect observed for citalopram or escitalopram; paroxetine has the greatest long-term increase in body weight among SSRIs, amitriptyline is the most potent tricyclic inducer of weight gain, and mirtazapine is associated with long-term weight gain; among serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine and duloxetine have been reported to slightly increase body weight; bupropion is the only antidepressant that consistently causes weight loss and significantly decreased body weight in clinical trials; the commissioned systematic review found weight gain with amitriptyline (1.8 kg) and weight loss with bupropion (−1.3 kg) and fluoxetine (−1.3 kg).

### Integrated safety profile of selinexor in multiple myeloma: experience from 437 patients enrolled in clinical trials [^0b9ba66f]. Leukemia (2020). Medium credibility.

The constitutional AE of fatigue requires early and vigilant management while patients are receiving selinexor treatment. Physicians should refer to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines for the treatment of cancer related fatigue, as well as closely monitor for and correct underlying contributors to fatigue. Methylphenidate at doses of ≥ 10 mg in the morning proved to be the most effective supportive care strategy for attenuating the symptoms of fatigue, with 8 out of 9 patients never having fatigue or having it resolve with use.

Decreased appetite and weight loss can occur with selinexor treatment and were also the primary side effects observed preclinically in animal models. Nutritional counseling, dose modifications, and appetite stimulants may prevent or improve weight loss. For patients with decreased appetite, megestrol, cannabinoids, and mirtazapine or olanzapine were effective at resolving anorexia and reducing its duration. Physicians should also monitor for corresponding N/V or dysgeusia, which can substantially impact a patient's desire to eat. Olanzapine (2.5–10 mg) used in the evening and begun prior to the first dose of selinexor appears to address both N/V and decreased appetite.

Gut–brain neuromodulators dosing and side effects (Table 2) — Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) such as amitriptyline or nortriptyline start at 10 mg at night and are titrated by 10 mg/wk or 10 mg/fortnight according to response and tolerability to a maximum of 30–50 mg at night, with common side effects of sedation, dry eyes, dry mouth, and constipation. Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as duloxetine start at 30 mg once daily and are titrated according to response and tolerability to a maximum of 60 mg once daily, with side effects including sedation, dry mouth, constipation or diarrhea, anxiety, reduced appetite, nausea, headache, and fatigue. Mirtazapine starts at 15 mg once daily and is titrated according to response and tolerability to a maximum of 45 mg once daily, with side effects including sleep disorders, constipation or diarrhea, anxiety, increased appetite and weight gain, nausea, headache, and fatigue; note that secondary amines include desipramine and nortriptyline, tertiary amines include amitriptyline and imipramine, and secondary amines may have fewer anticholinergic side effects than tertiary amines.

### Efficacy and safety of appetite-stimulating medications in the inpatient setting [^8178d0bc]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hospitalized patients are subject to acute illness and stress which may impact appetite or weight. Loss of appetite may lead to increased morbidity or mortality. Medications such as dronabinol, megestrol, and mirtazapine are used for weight gain in the outpatient setting; however, there is limited information about safety or effectiveness when initiated inpatient.

Objectives

To analyze the effectiveness and safety of appetite-stimulating medications in hospitalized patients.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized patients initiated on dronabinol, megestrol, or mirtazapine for appetite. The primary outcome was change in meal intake between drug initiation and discontinuation. Secondary outcomes included documented improvement in appetite, change in weight and various laboratory parameters, and incidence of adverse effects.

Results

A total of 38 patients met inclusion criteria, and mirtazapine was most commonly used (42%). There was no significant difference between groups of appetite-stimulating medications with regard to mean change in meal intake, weight, albumin, or documented improvement in diet. Within groups, each agent showed numerical improvement in percentage meal intake, with a mean change from initiation to discontinuation of 17.12%. Almost half (48%) of the patients experienced improvement in diet after the start of medications. No serious adverse effects were observed. Conclusion and Relevance: In inpatients, there was no difference in change in meal intake or weight between dronabinol, megestrol, or mirtazapine, but they may show numerical improvements in meal intake. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the use of dronabinol, megestrol, and mirtazapine initiated in the inpatient setting.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^10fd2ae5]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Alternative antidepressants to SSRIs in dementia — alternative agents include but are not limited to venlafaxine, mirtazapine, and bupropion. The serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine is metabolized through the cytochrome P450 system but does not induce or inhibit these enzymes and is less likely to interact with other drugs metabolized through the same system; one side effect more commonly seen with venlafaxine than other antidepressants is an elevation in blood pressure, which may be less likely with the sustained release formulation. Duloxetine is commonly used to treat major depression, but clinical experience with its use in geriatric patients with dementia is limited, and there are no published clinical trials to support its use. Mirtazapine can produce sedation and weight gain, especially at low doses, with rare but potentially serious side effects of liver toxicity and neutropenia. Bupropion has been associated with a risk of seizures, especially at high doses, in patients with anorexia or with structural neurological problems. Trazodone has sedative side effects and can be used when insomnia or severe agitation are prominent; at higher doses, significant side effects include postural hypotension and priapism.

### Characterizing eating behavioral phenotypes in mood disorders: a narrative review [^81b5e95b]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

With the vast heterogeneity of EBPs, it is important to note that time-restricted eating may not be appropriate for all individuals with mood disorders and maladaptive eating behaviors. For example, an individual with the circadian desynchronized EBP or high appetite EBP would benefit from this strategy while someone with a low appetite EBP and weight loss would not. Likewise, an individual with a comorbid ED such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa would also not be suitable due to the restrictive nature of this intervention. The need for different treatment approaches for each EBP reinforces the notion that phenotyping is beneficial to the identification of more effective and personalized treatment strategies for mood disorders. In addition, more work is needed to develop treatment protocols which address both mood and eating behavior.

From a transdiagnostic lens, multiple pharmacotherapies used in psychiatry may also prove useful in the treatment of maladaptive eating behavior in mood disorders, as outlined in Table 2. For example, appetite suppressants such as GLP-1 agonists (e.g. liraglutide), metformin, and orlistat may be implemented for the high appetite EBP (Chwastiak & Tek; Kanoski, Hayes, & Skibicka; Mansur et al; Park et al; Watson et al.). In addition, appetite stimulants are already being adapted to psychiatric illnesses, including dronabinol, megestrol and mirtazapine to increase weight in cases of low appetite (Badowski & Yanful; Howard, Hossaini, Tolar, & Gaviola). Serotonergic agents may be useful to the emotional eating EBP as well as opioid antagonists which have demonstrated success in the treatment of binge eating (Glisenti, Strodl, King, & Greenberg; McElroy, Guerdjikova, Mori, & O'Melia). Other potential pharmacotherapies for EBPs include dopaminergic and opioid agents for the food 'addiction' EBP as well as nutritional supplementation for the unhealthy diet EBP (Martins et al; McElroy et al.). When considering such psychopharmacological therapies, it is important to address the impact of medications on eating behavior. For example, second-generation antipsychotics are widely prescribed for BD but have been linked to poor appetite control, weight gain and the development of metabolic syndrome (Barton, Segger, Fischer, Obermeier, & Musil; Dayabandara et al.). Considering a personalized medicine approach will be principal in moving forward with the development of treatment protocols for EBPs in mood disorders.

### What is the evidence for mirtazapine in treating cancer-related symptomatology? A systematic review [^d8e62ca7]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Our review has several limitations. Whilst including grey literature, we cannot be certain that we have identified all studies. Some studies were excluded from the review because the data was not available. Publication bias is a common concern in interventional studies, especially in populations with life-threatening diseases, as many studies do not recruit or retain enough patients to have strong results, limiting their publication in peer-reviewed journals. Therefore, this review may have been impacted by publication bias. Additionally, we excluded studies that did not focus only on cancer patients. This decision was supported by the fact that most of these studies had "cancer-affected patients" as exclusion criteria. However, this choice potentially led to the neglect of relevant data.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Data from published literature report the presence of mirtazapine in human milk at low levels with relative infant doses for mirtazapine ranging between 0.6 and 2.8% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose (see Data). No adverse effects on the breastfed infant have been reported in most cases of maternal use of mirtazapine. There are no data on the effects of mirtazapine on milk production.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for mirtazapine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from mirtazapine or from the underlying maternal condition.

Data

In a published pooled analysis of 8 breastfeeding mother-infant pairs, the mean (min, max) total relative infant doses for mirtazapine and its desmethyl metabolite were 1.5% (0.6%, 2.8%) and 0.4% (0.1%, 0.7%) of the maternal weight-adjusted dose (median (min, max) dose of 38 mg (30 mg, 120 mg), respectively). No adverse drug effects were reported for any of the infants.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of mirtazapine have not been established in pediatric patients with MDD. Two placebo-controlled trials in 258 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with mirtazapine, and the data were insufficient to establish the safety and effectiveness of mirtazapine in pediatric patients with MDD.

Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

In an 8-week-long clinical trial in pediatric patients receiving doses between 15 to 45 mg per day, 49% of mirtazapine-treated patients had a weight gain of at least 7%, compared to 5.7% of placebo-treated patients. The mean increase in weight was 4 kg (2 kg SD) for mirtazapine-treated patients versus 1 kg (2 kg SD) for placebo-treated patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: a proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^d85f2177]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Guanfacine is a medication in the same drug class as clonidine (α 2 -adrenergic agonist), and some practitioners may prefer trying guanfacine before clonidine. Guanfacine is FDA-approved for ADHD in children but is used off-label for sleep disturbances. The short-acting guanfacine can be prescribed at a starting dose of half of a 1 mg tablet (0.5 mg) and can be increased by 0.5–1 mg every 3 to 5 days as tolerated up to 2 mg for sleep disturbances. Long-acting guanfacine preparations can be effective for sleep maintenance. If the short-acting preparation is effective with sleep onset and the patient can swallow a pill, then guanfacine ER can be tried. Dosing of guanfacine ER should start with 1 mg (these tablets cannot be broken or chewed) and can be increased every 5–7 days until achieving the desired clinical response or reaching a maximum dose of 4 mg/day.

Trazodone, a 5-HT 2 antagonist, was initially FDA-approved for the treatment of depression in adults and was found to be too sedating. It is thus frequently used for sleep disturbance in adults and children with mood and anxiety disorders. There are no RCTs of trazodone in children with ASD, yet clinically, it is a very effective medication for improving sleep onset and maintenance. Side effects, including prolonged erection of the penis (priapism), should be explained to patients and families. Start with half of a 50 mg tablet (25 mg) at bedtime and increase weekly by 25 mg to a maximum dosage of 100–150 mg at bedtime, depending on body weight.

Mirtazapine is a central presynaptic α 2 -adrenergic antagonist and serotonin (5-HT) 2,3 antagonist and is FDA-approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults. There are no RCTs of mirtazapine for sleep, yet this also can be effective for sleep onset and maintenance. Some of the common side effects of mirtazapine include drowsiness, increased appetite, weight gain, and irritability. See the anxiety section for dosing and titration recommendations.

### The effect of mirtazapine on gastric accommodation, gastric sensitivity to distention, and nutrient tolerance in healthy subjects [^10cdf9cf]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Disturbances of gastric motor function of functional dyspepsia (FD) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the symptoms, and hence, motility modifying agents are considered for its treatment. Mirtazapine was recently shown to improve symptoms and increase nutrient tolerance in FD patients with weight loss. We aim to evaluate the effect of mirtazapine on gastric sensorimotor function in healthy volunteers (HV).

Methods

Thirty-one HV underwent an intragastric pressure (IGP) and barostat measurements on separate days before and after 3 weeks of placebo or mirtazapine (15 mg). Gastric compliance, sensitivity and accommodation (GA) measured by the barostat. GA was quantitated as the difference (delta) in intra-balloon volume before and after ingestion of 200 mL of a nutrient drink (ND). GA measured by IGP was quantitated as the drop of IGP from baseline during the intragastric infusion of ND until maximal satiation.

Key Results

Mirtazapine significantly increased the bodyweight of subjects (67.8 ± 3.7 to 69.1 ± 3.7 kg; P = 0.01). Barostat results showed no effect on gastric compliance, sensitivity, and GA. Nutrient tolerance was not affected after treatment (1170 ± 129.4 vs 1104 ± 133.6 kcal; P = 0.4), and mirtazapine was associated with lower symptom ratings. The IGP drop during meal ingestion was significantly suppressed (area under the curve: -43.3 ± 4.5 mm Hg vs -28.9 ± 3.1 mm Hg; P = 0.005).

Conclusions & Inferences

In HVs, the occurrence of weight gain and decreased meal-induced symptoms in spite of a suppressed meal-induced IGP drop, point towards a central mode of action. Mirtazapine does not display changes in gastric sensorimotor function that could explain its beneficial effects on symptoms and nutrient tolerance in FD.

Sleep-related eating disorder (SRED) is classified within parasomnia and is characterised by recurrent episodes of abnormal, dysfunctional eating during sleep. This report describes a case of SRED in a 19-year-old woman admitted to the psychiatric ward with worsening anxiety, low mood and suicidal ideation. She was started on low-dose mirtazapine for mood stabilisation and, following an incremental increase to 30mg, she developed nocturnal binge eating of which she retained only partial memory on waking. She developed adverse health consequences as a result of these recurrent episodes. The subject's symptoms were relieved rapidly following reduction of the dose of mirtazapine back to 15mg.

### A meta-analysis of clinical trials comparing mirtazapine with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for the treatment of major depressive disorder [^8e060394]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

Over the past few years, a number of studies have suggested that the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) with anti-depressants enhancing both noradrenergic as well as serotonergic neurotransmission may result in higher response or remission rates than treatment with anti-depressants selectively enhancing serotonergic neurotransmission. The objective of this paper was to compare response rates among patients with MDD treated with either mirtazapine, an anti-depressant thought to simultaneously enhance both noradrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Medline/Pubmed were searched. No year of publication limits were used. Double-blind, randomized clinical trials comparing mirtazapine with an SSRI for the treatment of MDD. Data were extracted with the use of a pre-coded form. Analyses were performed comparing response rates between the two anti-depressant agents. Data from 10 reports involving a total of 1904 outpatients with MDD were identified and combined using a random-effects model. Patients randomized to treatment with mirtazapine were as likely to experience clinical response as patients randomized to treatment with an SSRI (RR = 1.07; 95% CI: 0.96–1.2, P = 0.181). Simply pooling response rates between the two agents revealed a 67.1% response rate for mirtazapine and a 62.1% response rate for the SSRIs. There was no difference in overall discontinuation rates (RR = 1.1; 95% CI: 0.7–1.5; P = 0.550), discontinuation rates due to adverse events (RR = 0.9; 95% CI: 0.6–1.2; P = 0.497), or discontinuation rates due to lack of efficacy (RR = 0.9; 95% CI: 0.4–2.0; P = 0.871) between the two groups. Fewer mirtazapine-treated patients complained of insomnia (RR = 0.5; 95% CI: 0.3–0.9; P = 0.017), nausea (RR = 0.3; 95% CI: 0.3–0.5; P < 0.0001), whereas fewer SSRI-treated patients complained of fatigue (RR = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1–2.4; P = 0.028), excessive sleepiness (RR = 1.3; 95% CI: 1.1–1.7; P = 0.020), weight-gain (RR = 3.8; 95% CI: 2.3–6.4; P < 0.0001) or dry mouth (RR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.3–2.4; P < 0.0001) during the course of treatment. These results suggest that mirtazapine and the SSRIs differ with respect to their side-effect profile but not their overall efficacy in the treatment of MDD.

Drug interactions between NNRTIs and mirtazapine — With DOR, RPV IM, and RPV PO, ↔ mirtazapine expected and no dose adjustment needed; with EFV or ETR, ↓ mirtazapine possible and monitor antidepressant effect, then titrate dose as necessary based on clinical response.
