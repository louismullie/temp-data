## Question

Does chronic hypoxia lead to an increase in erythropoietin production

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether chronic hypoxia leads to an increase in erythropoietin (EPO) production. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core oxygen-sensing mechanism that regulates EPO. Then, I should verify the specific role of HIF-2α in renal and hepatic EPO synthesis. Next, I will examine human and translational evidence for chronic hypoxia driving sustained EPO and erythrocytosis. After that, I need to check important exceptions where the EPO response is blunted despite hypoxia. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically grounded conclusion and note modifiers like iron availability and inflammation that can modulate the response.

> Let me first confirm the core mechanism. EPO production is governed by oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of HIF-α subunits; in normoxia, PHD enzymes hydroxylate HIF-α, marking it for VHL-mediated degradation, whereas in hypoxia, PHD activity is suppressed, HIF-α stabilizes, and HIF-2α in particular drives EPO transcription in renal peritubular fibroblast-like cells and hepatocytes, establishing the canonical link between tissue hypoxia and EPO induction [^116zD9Rz] [^114JhNLN] [^114rXeiH].

> Wait, let me verify the specific isoform responsible for erythropoiesis. I initially thought HIF-1α might be the primary driver, but hold on, I should double-check that. The weight of evidence shows HIF-2α is the principal regulator of EPO gene expression, with HIF-1α playing a lesser or antagonistic role in some contexts, and genetic or pharmacologic HIF-2α activation increases EPO and red cell mass, confirming this assignment [^112eN5uT] [^1143EcYD] [^111ZPmzo].

> Next, I should review direct human evidence for chronic hypoxia increasing EPO. High-altitude exposure provides a clean model: within hours of ascent, plasma EPO rises and, with sustained exposure, hematocrit and hemoglobin increase, often substantially, reflecting a durable erythropoietic response. Importantly, EPO levels can normalize toward a new set point even as polycythemia persists, consistent with adaptive regulation under chronic hypoxia [^113Acsig] [^113Xm6ZY] [^111VRwSf].

> I will now examine disease models of chronic hypoxemia. In COPD, chronic hypoxemia is a recognized driver of secondary erythrocytosis in a subset of patients, and the pathophysiology aligns with HIF-2α–mediated EPO induction. However, I need to ensure I don't overgeneralize, because inflammation and other factors can blunt or modulate the EPO response in many patients with chronic lung disease, explaining variability in erythrocytosis prevalence despite hypoxemia [^111ZPmzo] [^114tmkLa] [^117WhhLo].

> Let me consider pharmacologic corroboration. HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors stabilize HIF-2α and increase endogenous EPO in CKD patients, raising hemoglobin with physiologic-range EPO levels. This pharmacologic mimicry of hypoxia strengthens the causal inference that HIF-2α activation increases EPO and supports the biological plausibility of chronic hypoxia doing the same in intact systems [^114JhNLN] [^113ubhsj] [^114BL6kC].

> Hold on, I should verify exceptions where the EPO response is attenuated despite hypoxia. In chronic kidney disease, progressive tubulointerstitial injury and loss of EPO-producing interstitial cells blunt endogenous EPO production, so chronic hypoxia alone may not restore adequate EPO; similarly, inflammatory cytokines can suppress EPO synthesis and impair erythropoiesis, producing a relative EPO deficiency or EPO resistance phenotype even in hypoxic states [^1139X2z6] [^115jYHh7] [^113PDxGF].

> Let me synthesize. Chronic hypoxia, via HIF-2α stabilization, generally increases EPO production and can sustain erythrocytosis, as demonstrated in high-altitude populations and in hypoxemic lung disease subsets. However, the magnitude and persistence of the EPO rise depend on the integrity of oxygen-sensing cells, iron availability, and the inflammatory milieu, which can constrain or blunt the response in diseases like CKD and some chronic inflammatory states [^113Xm6ZY] [^111ZPmzo] [^114JhNLN].

> Final answer: Yes, chronic hypoxia increases EPO production through HIF-2α–mediated transcriptional activation, with sustained effects evident in high-altitude residents and some patients with chronic hypoxemic lung disease. However, the response is context dependent and may be attenuated when renal EPO-producing capacity is lost or when inflammation and iron restriction impair erythropoiesis, so the clinical phenotype ranges from secondary polycythemia to a blunted or absent erythrocytosis despite ongoing hypoxia [^116zD9Rz] [^113Acsig] [^114tmkLa].

Chronic hypoxia increases **erythropoietin (EPO)** production via HIF-2α stabilization [^113sKdyK], which drives EPO gene transcription in renal peritubular fibroblast-like cells and hepatocytes [^1139X2z6]. This **HIF-2α–mediated response** is the primary mechanism of EPO induction in chronic hypoxia, with HIF-1α playing a lesser role [^112eN5uT]. The resulting EPO rise stimulates erythropoiesis and can cause **secondary polycythemia** [^111ZPmzo] if hypoxia persists [^113Acsig]. However, inflammation, iron deficiency, or renal damage can blunt this response, limiting EPO production despite ongoing hypoxia [^114tmkLa] [^115jYHh7].

## Molecular mechanisms of EPO production in chronic hypoxia

### HIF-2α stabilization and EPO gene transcription

- **HIF-2α as the primary regulator**: HIF-2α is the principal transcription factor governing EPO synthesis in chronic hypoxia [^114JhNLN]; its stabilization under low oxygen drives EPO transcription in renal peritubular fibroblast-like cells and hepatocytes [^1139X2z6].

- **Oxygen-dependent regulation**: In normoxia, PHD enzymes hydroxylate HIF-α, targeting it for VHL-mediated degradation; in hypoxia, PHD activity falls, HIF-α accumulates, and HIF-2α induces EPO [^116zD9Rz].

- **HIF-1α vs. HIF-2α**: HIF-1α regulates acute hypoxia responses, whereas HIF-2α governs chronic adaptation, including sustained EPO production [^116by5BP].

### Cellular sources of EPO in chronic hypoxia

| **Cellular source** | **Role in epo production** | **Evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Renal peritubular fibroblast-like cells | Primary EPO source in adults; proliferate and increase EPO output in chronic hypoxia | - Single-cell studies [^114rXeiH] <br/> - Reviews [^1139X2z6] |
| Hepatocytes | Secondary source; increase EPO synthesis when renal production is impaired or stimulation is sustained | - Reviews [^1139X2z6] <br/> - Experimental models [^111LHNnK] |

---

## Evidence from clinical and experimental studies

### High-altitude exposure

High-altitude exposure increases EPO within hours, peaks at ~2 days, and declines toward baseline over 1–2 weeks despite ongoing hypoxia; hemoglobin and hematocrit continue to rise for months, reflecting sustained erythropoiesis [^113Acsig]. Populations at high altitude exhibit elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit proportional to hypoxia severity, consistent with chronic HIF-2α–driven EPO signaling [^113Acsig] [^114JhNLN] [^116by5BP].

---

### Chronic lung disease

In COPD, chronic hypoxemia increases EPO and can cause secondary polycythemia, though inflammation and iron restriction may blunt the response in some patients [^111ZPmzo] [^114tmkLa]. Polycythemia is common in severe COPD with sustained hypoxemia, supporting a functional EPO-driven erythropoietic response [^113p8oz4] [^111ZPmzo].

---

### Chronic kidney disease

In CKD, renal EPO-producing cells are lost with fibrosis, causing anemia despite hypoxia; however, HIF-PHI therapy restores physiologic EPO and improves anemia, confirming intact HIF-2α signaling when PHD is inhibited [^114JhNLN] [^113ubhsj]. HIF-PHIs increase endogenous EPO and improve iron utilization, mimicking the natural hypoxic response [^114JhNLN].

---

## Factors modulating EPO production in chronic hypoxia

Several factors modulate EPO production in chronic hypoxia: **inflammation** — cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α can suppress EPO synthesis and contribute to anemia of chronic disease [^notfound]; **iron availability** — iron deficiency or restricted iron flux impairs erythropoiesis and can blunt the EPO response despite hypoxia [^114RqVtL]; and **renal function** — CKD-related loss of EPO-producing cells limits EPO output, though HIF-PHIs can partially restore it [^112kd8pL].

---

## Physiological consequences of increased EPO in chronic hypoxia

Increased EPO in chronic hypoxia expands red cell mass and raises **hemoglobin/hematocrit**, improving arterial oxygen content and tissue oxygen delivery [^113Acsig]. It also promotes **pulmonary vascular remodeling** and hypertension via VEGF and other HIF targets, which may worsen right heart strain over time [^111JbqJj]. The net effect is a trade-off between improved oxygen delivery and risks of hyperviscosity and **pulmonary hypertension** [^115widBw].

---

## Summary of key findings

- **Primary mechanism**: HIF-2α stabilization drives EPO transcription in renal and hepatic cells during chronic hypoxia [^1139X2z6].

- **Evidence**: High-altitude, COPD, and CKD studies show increased EPO and erythropoiesis in chronic hypoxia, with modulation by inflammation, iron, and renal function [^113Xm6ZY] [^111ZPmzo] [^113sKdyK].

- **Clinical implications**: Chronic hypoxia increases EPO and can cause secondary polycythemia; however, inflammation, iron deficiency, or renal damage can blunt the response, and HIF-PHIs can restore physiologic EPO in CKD [^111ZPmzo] [^114BL6kC].

---

Chronic hypoxia increases EPO production predominantly through **HIF-2α–mediated transcription**, with renal peritubular fibroblast-like cells as the main source and hepatocytes as a secondary source; the magnitude is shaped by inflammation, iron availability, and renal function, and sustained increases can drive secondary polycythemia.

Pathogenetic mechanisms in hypoxia-induced secondary erythrocytosis

The HIF pathway regulates erythropoiesis and EPO production within renal peritubular cells, in an oxygen-dependent manner. HIF transcription factor is a heterodimer with alpha and beta subunits, the latter is constitutively expressed, while hypoxia affects the function of the former. HIF-A has three known isoforms (HIF-1A, HIF2A, HIF-3A), amongst which HIF2A is mainly involved in regulation of EPO synthesis; HIF2A knockout mice demonstrate a hypocellular marrow and anemia as a result of inadequate EPO production. In the presence of oxygen, HIF2A undergoes hydroxylation at two critical proline residues, Pro405 and Pro531, mediated by PHD2, following which it undergoes degradation by the ubiquitin proteasomal pathway, a process mediated by VHL, a tumor suppressor protein, serving as the substrate recognition component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. In addition, a 2-oxoglutarate dependent oxygenase, factor inhibiting HIF (FIH), catalyzes hydroxylation of a specific arginine residue within HIF which inhibits HIF binding to p300, a transcriptional co-activator. The end result is reduced transcriptional activation of EPO; a HIF target gene.

Conversely, under hypoxic conditions, PHD2 enzymatic activity is reduced, resulting in diminished hydroxylation and degradation of HIF2A, in other words stabilization of HIF2A following which the HIF complex binds hypoxia responsive elements within the EPO gene and turns on its transcription. This constitutes the pathogenetic basis for hypoxia-induced acquired erythrocytosis associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cyanotic heart disease with right to left shunt, and high-altitude habitat. Amelioration of tissue hypoxia reverses the process resulting in compensated normal EPO in such conditions, consistent with the assertion that regulation of erythropoiesis by HIF is exquisitely sensitive to oxygen levels. In addition, HIF2A expression is also controlled by iron regulatory proteins 1 and 2 (Irps) via its iron-responsive elements, and deletion of Irp1 in murine studies has been found to increase HIF2A expression, which in turn stimulates EPO, leading to erythrocytosis.

### Suffocating cancer: hypoxia-associated epimutations as targets for cancer therapy [^116by5BP]. Clinical Epigenetics (2011). Low credibility.

The hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) pathway is the key regulatory pathway activated in response to tissue hypoxia. In normoxic conditions HIF is degraded through interaction with the Von-Hippel Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor protein (pVHL) where it becomes polyubiquinated and undergoes proteosomal degradation. The interaction between VHL and HIF is controlled via post-translational prolyl hydroxylation of HIF through prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs). In hypoxic conditions HIF does not bind to VHL due to the action of PHDs and therefore accumulates. HIF-1α then binds to hypoxia response elements (HRE) along with co-factors HIF-1β (also known as arylhydrocarbon receptor nuclear factor (ARNT)), E1A binding protein p300 (EP300), jun proto-oncogene (c-JUN) and cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB). This leads to the transcription and up-regulation of over 100 genes involved in angiogenesis, glucose metabolism and transportation, erythropoietin production, cellular proliferation, tumour invasion/metastasis and p53 mediated apoptosis. Three HIF-α subunits have been identified, HIF-1α and HIF-2α are thought to have roles in acute and chronic hypoxia respectively whereas the role of HIF-3α is yet to be determined. In vitro studies in several cell culture systems have shown that HIF is activated at approximately 5% O 2 (40 mmHg) and activity increases with decreasing oxygenation down to 0.2–1.0% (1.6–0.8 mmHg) O 2 nearing anoxia. See Figure 1 for an overview of the HIF pathway (adapted from Biocarta). As HIF activation leads to the development of tumour vascularisation, it plays a significant role in tumour progression and metastasis. Over-expression of HIF-1α and HIF-2α has been documented in several primary tumours and associated metastases, the degree of expression correlates with angiogenesis, resistance to treatment and overall patient outcome. The HIF pathway can also be activated through germline or somatic mutation of VHL or through VHL promoter methylation leading to transcriptional repression. Renal cell carcinoma can develop through all of these mechanisms (reviewed in). For a review of the role of HIF in tumourigenesis see. As HIF activation can be deleterious to both cancerous and normal cells, feedback mechanisms exist to control the level of HIF activation, which leads to a switch from HIF-1α to HIF-2α driven response when acute hypoxia becomes chronic. HIF-2α driven responses occurring in chronic hypoxia may be involved in the regulation of tumour cellular differentiation and stem cell maintenance (reviewed in).

### The role of hepcidin in iron homeostasis and anemia in hemodialysis patients [^114qGYXG]. Seminars in Dialysis (2009). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common complication in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Despite the great success of recombinant human erythropoietin in clinical practice, resistance to this therapy is common. Additionally, nephrologists frequently witness a rapid and significant drop in their patients' hematocrit during the course of various acute events that regularly take place in this sensitive population. Hepcidin, a recently identified peptide, may mediate this development in many instances. Hepcidin production is regulated by hypoxia/anemia, iron status, and importantly, inflammation. This peptide can block iron absorption by the duodenum, iron release from both the liver (the main iron storage pool) and, more significantly, the macrophages interrupting iron recycling between senescent red cells and the reticuloendothelial system. The decreased availability of iron for erythropoiesis leads to the anemia of chronic disease or, in HD patients, aggravate an already existing anemia HD is now widely considered an inflammatory state probably accounting for the increased serum hepcidin levels that have been associated with it. The physiology of hepcidin and its possible contribution to the pathogenesis of anemia in HD patients are the subject of this review.

### Erythrocytosis: the HIF pathway in control [^117XNd1w]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

Organisms living under aerobic conditions need oxygen for the metabolic conversion of nutrition into energy. With the appearance of increasingly complex animals, a specialized transport system (erythrocytes) arose during evolution to provide oxygen to virtually every single cell in the body. Moreover, in case of low environmental partial pressure of oxygen, the number of erythrocytes automatically increases to preserve sustained oxygen delivery. This process relies predominantly on the cytokine erythropoietin (Epo) and its transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), whereas the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) ubiquitin ligase as well as the oxygen-sensitive prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) represent essential regulators of this oxygen-sensing system. Deregulation of particular members of this pathway (eg, PHD2, HIF2α, VHL) lead to disorders in blood homeostasis as a result of insufficient (anemia) or excessive (erythrocytosis) red blood cell production.

### The effect of altitude on dosing and response to erythropoietin in ESRD [^115p3j4m]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

For poorly understood reasons, patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) differ substantially in their response to treatment with recombinant erythropoietin (EPO). Because hypoxia influences many of the biologic pathways involved in erythropoiesis, the altitude at which a patient lives may affect the dose-response relationship of EPO. In this retrospective cohort study, clinical data from 341,737 incident hemodialysis patients registered in the U.S. Renal Data System were combined with elevation data from the U.S. Geological Survey to address this question. Higher altitude was associated with smaller EPO doses and higher hematocrit levels. For example, compared with patients at sea level, patients living above 6000 ft received 19% less EPO (12.9 versus 15.9 thousand units/wk) but had hematocrit levels 1.1 points higher (35.7% versus 34.6%). These associations were found within subgroups defined by sex, race, age, calendar time, cause of ESRD, and dialysis center profit status, and persisted after adjustment for various potential confounding factors. Furthermore, resistance to EPO decreased with elevation. Our results suggest that ESRD patients living at high altitude either increase endogenous EPO production or respond better to endogenous and exogenous EPO.

TEXT OF REVIEW

Hypoxia response

Hypoxia is defined as a state of inadequate oxygen supply to the tissues. Hypoxia consequences on tissue are mainly related to the activation of the inducible factor (HIF) pathway. In conditions where the HIF pathway is activated, such as hypoxia caused by reduced blood flow or oxygen availability, it orchestrates cellular responses to promote adaptation and survival, including angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, and glycolysis. HIFs consist of various oxygen-sensitive α subunits (HIF-1α to -3α) and a stable β subunit (HIF-β), forming heterodimeric complexes. These complexes translocate to the nucleus, where they bind to transcriptional coactivators such as C-AMP Response Element-binding protein (CREB-binding protein)/binding protein p300 (CBP/p300), thereby enhancing the transcription of target genes. HIF-dependent gene regulation orchestrates cellular and tissue adaptation to low oxygen levels. Among the vast array of HIF target genes, numbering potentially over a thousand, are crucial factors like erythropoietin (EPO), transferrin, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Additionally, HIF activation redirects cellular metabolism towards anaerobic pathways, fostering increased glycolytic enzyme expression while inhibiting oxidative metabolism through mechanisms such as upregulating pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1. However, prolonged or excessive HIF activation can contribute to pathological processes like inflammation, fibrosis, and tumor progression.

### Mechanisms of enhanced renal and hepatic erythropoietin synthesis by sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors [^1122fxqM]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite these observations, the available evidence does not provide substantial support to the 'renal corticomedullary hypoxia' hypothesis as a mechanism of increased erythropoietin production. In experimental and clinical studies of renal oxygenation, SGLT2 inhibition produced hypoxia in the deep cortex and outer medulla in diabetic subjects, but intriguingly, not in those without diabetes; yet, patients without diabetes still manifest a robust erythrocytosis following SGLT2 inhibition. Furthermore, acetazolamide blocks sodium reabsorption in the S2 segment, and increases sodium delivery to the S3 segment (with the potential for tubular hypoxia), and yet, the drug does not induce an increase in hematocrit. Increased sodium delivery and tubular workload at the loop of Henle leading to outer medullary hypoxia cannot explain the increase in erythropoiesis, since the increased tubular workload and oxygen consumption would be blocked by loop diuretics; yet, patients with heart failure prescribed loop diuretics still manifest a strong erythropoietic response. Moreover, although blockade of SGLT1 should alleviate the hypoxia in the S3 segment, dual SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibition does not produce a potentiated erythrocytosis, as compared with selective SGLT2 inhibitors. Most importantly, SGLT2 inhibitors produce a robust increase in hematocrit in patients with stage 3b/4 chronic kidney disease and in patients with renal anemia, even though these patients manifest a diminished distal tubular sodium delivery due to glomerular hypofiltration, and they manifest a severe impairment of renal synthesis of erythropoietin, rebutting the possibility that SGLT2 inhibitors enhance renal erythropoietin production as a result of increased corticomedullary tubular workload.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor-mediated iron mobilization promotes hypoxia-inducible factor-2α signaling in the kidney and liver

Many of the disease states that are treated with SGLT2 inhibitors are characterized by anemia of chronic disease, a chronic inflammatory state that is characterized by increased levels of two major iron regulatory proteins — hepcidin and ferritin. Increases in the synthesis of hepcidin by the liver block the absorption of iron from the duodenum and the release of iron from the reticuloendothelial system. Increases in ferritin in heme-producing cells result in the sequestration of ferrous iron in an intracellular nanocage, preventing its release into the cytosol. Increases in hepcidin and ferritin are responsible for the development of a state of functional iron deficiency in patients with type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and chronic heart failure, in the face of adequate total body iron stores.

### Inhibition of prolyl hydroxylases increases erythropoietin production in ESRD [^116RLUKq]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

The reasons for inadequate production of erythropoietin (EPO) in patients with ESRD are poorly understood. A better understanding of EPO regulation, namely oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF), may enable targeted pharmacological intervention. Here, we tested the ability of fibrotic kidneys and extrarenal tissues to produce EPO. In this phase 1 study, we used an orally active prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitor, FG-2216, to stabilize HIF independent of oxygen availability in 12 hemodialysis (HD) patients, six of whom were anephric, and in six healthy volunteers. FG-2216 increased plasma EPO levels 30.8-fold in HD patients with kidneys, 14.5-fold in anephric HD patients, and 12.7-fold in healthy volunteers. These data demonstrate that pharmacologic manipulation of the HIF system can stimulate endogenous EPO production. Furthermore, the data indicate that deranged oxygen sensing — not a loss of EPO production capacity — causes renal anemia.

### The transcriptional and regulatory identity of erythropoietin producing cells [^114rXeiH]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Erythropoietin (Epo) is the master regulator of erythropoiesis and oxygen homeostasis. Despite its physiological importance, the molecular and genomic contexts of the cells responsible for renal Epo production remain unclear, limiting more-effective therapies for anemia. Here, we performed single-cell RNA and transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC) sequencing of an Epo reporter mouse to molecularly identify Epo-producing cells under hypoxic conditions. Our data indicate that a distinct population of kidney stroma, which we term Norn cells, is the major source of endocrine Epo production in mice. We use these datasets to identify the markers, signaling pathways and transcriptional circuits characteristic of Norn cells. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and RNA in situ hybridization in human kidney tissues, we further provide evidence that this cell population is conserved in humans. These preliminary findings open new avenues to functionally dissect EPO gene regulation in health and disease and may serve as groundwork to improve erythropoiesis-stimulating therapies.

### Increased fetal plasma and amniotic fluid erythropoietin concentrations: markers of intrauterine hypoxia [^112ECg9W]. Neonatology (2009). Low credibility.

Tissue hypoxia is the major stimulus of erythropoietin (EPO) synthesis in fetuses and adults. Since EPO does not cross the placenta and is not stored, fetal plasma and amniotic fluid levels indicate EPO synthesis and elimination. Acutely, the rate and magnitude of the increase in plasma EPO levels correlate with the intensity of hypoxia. Amniotic fluid EPO levels correlate with cord plasma levels in normal and abnormal pregnancies, with fetal plasma EPO levels in humans averaging 2.6 times higher than the corresponding amniotic fluid EPO levels. Recent experimental and clinical studies demonstrate that EPO has neuroprotective effects related to its anti-apoptotic and vascular growth-promoting properties. Although under basal conditions the fetal kidneys are the main site of EPO production, during hypoxia recent experimental data indicate an important role of the placenta. Amniotic fluid EPO levels have been shown to increase exponentially during fetal hypoxia in preeclamptic, diabetic and Rh-immunized pregnancies, to correlate inversely with cord blood pH, pO(2) and base excess and to predict neonatal morbidities and NICU admission. As an indicator of chronic intrauterine hypoxia, fetal EPO measurements have increased our knowledge about the pathogenesis and importance of intrauterine growth restriction, macrosomia, diabetic pregnancy, prolonged pregnancy, meconium staining, fetal hemorrhage, fetal anemia, maternal smoking and alcohol consumption, abnormal fetal heart rate and abnormal Doppler flow patterns. While the clinical utility of fetal amniotic fluid and plasma EPO measurements in the management of high-risk pregnancies and their offspring is promising, adequately powered clinical trials are urgently needed.

### Anaemia and iron dysregulation: untapped therapeutic targets in chronic lung disease? [^111k8m6Q]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Novel treatment options

The only disease area where correction of anaemia of chronic disease has been extensively studied is in chronic kidney disease (CKD) in response to recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) and its analogues. Even in the presence of normal lung physiology, therapy in CKD has been demonstrated to improve exercise tolerance, HRQoL, cerebration and left ventricular hypertrophy. There is also evidence to show a beneficial effect in chronic heart failure with improved exercise tolerance, decreased oxygen utilisation on exercise, improved renal function, decreased brain natriuretic peptide and reduced hospitalisation; however, concerns over the deleterious effects of increased EPO levels and adverse cardiovascular events have led to a lack of enthusiasm for use of EPO in chronic heart failure and more conservative usage in CKD. Treatment of anaemia of CKD with rhEPO is associated with increased cardiovascular risk which is postulated to be related to the associated increases in EPO exposure. It is unclear if this risk can be attributed solely to EPO exposure as opposed to targeted or achieved Hb, the specific relevance of the absolute Hb, Hb change, the rate of Hb change or the EPO levels that occur in dosing patients with rhEPO. Given that normal Hb levels are protective and other therapies increase Hb without risk, the supraphysiological levels of EPO and impact on sympathetic drive seem inherently most relevant but this is as yet unproven. Subsequently, for CKD, US Prescribing Information for all currently approved erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESAs) contains a Boxed Warning and European labels contain warnings that patients experienced greater risk for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions and stroke when administered ESAs to target a Hb level of greater than 11 g/dL.

### Chronic hypoxia and tubulointerstitial injury: a final common pathway to end-stage renal failure [^117EBs9a]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Recent studies emphasize the role of chronic hypoxia in the tubulointerstitium as a final common pathway to end-stage renal failure. When advanced, tubulointerstitial damage is associated with the loss of peritubular capillaries. Associated interstitial fibrosis impairs oxygen diffusion and supply to tubular and interstitial cells. Hypoxia of tubular cells leads to apoptosis or epithelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation. This in turn exacerbates fibrosis of the kidney and subsequent chronic hypoxia, setting in train a vicious cycle whose end point is ESRD. A number of mechanisms that induce tubulointerstitial hypoxia at an early stage have been identified. Glomerular injury and vasoconstriction of efferent arterioles as a result of imbalances in vasoactive substances decrease postglomerular peritubular capillary blood flow. Angiotensin II not only constricts efferent arterioles but, via its induction of oxidative stress, also hampers the efficient utilization of oxygen in tubular cells. Relative hypoxia in the kidney also results from increased metabolic demand in tubular cells. Furthermore, renal anemia hinders oxygen delivery. These factors can affect the kidney before the appearance of significant pathologic changes in the vasculature and predispose the kidney to tubulointerstitial injury. Therapeutic approaches that target the chronic hypoxia should prove effective against a broad range of renal diseases. Current modalities include the improvement of anemia with erythropoietin, the preservation of peritubular capillary blood flow by blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, and the use of antioxidants. Recent studies have elucidated the mechanism of hypoxia-induced transcription, namely that prolyl hydroxylase regulates hypoxia-inducible factor. This has given hope for the development of novel therapeutic approaches against this final common pathway.

### Hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors for anaemia in chronic kidney disease: a clinical practice document by the European renal best practice board of the European renal association [^114dCHCU]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

The peritubular interstitial EPO-producing cells are predominantly located in a zone of the kidney with relative hypoxia, where small decreases in blood oxygen stimulate upregulation of the HIF-2α leading to increased transcription of the EPO genes and increased levels of circulating EPO. There is evidence that HIF is activated spontaneously in HD patients living 1300–1400 m above sea level, as they have higher haemoglobin levels despite requiring lower ESA and iron doses. Similarly, in patients with CKD, the risk of anaemia was lower at higher altitude.

A major class of genes moderated by HIFs include those involved in iron handling and metabolism. The impact of the HIF pathway on iron homeostasis is modulated by HIF-2α stimulation of iron absorption in the duodenum and by suppression of hepcidin. Hepcidin reduces dietary iron absorption and blocks the release of stored iron from macrophages and the liver by decreasing the expression of ferroportin, an iron exporter, leading to reduced circulating iron levels.

HIF activation results in a broad physiologic response with various pleiotropic effects (beneficial, neutral or harmful). Many of these effects are context dependent and can go in opposite directions depending on the duration and severity of the hypoxic state. In animal studies, pharmacological inhibition of HIF-PH had a renoprotective effect from ischaemic injury caused by AKI, although other experimental studies showed increased fibrosis following HIF activation. Many of the genes involved in angiogenesis, such as vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs), are directly induced by HIF-1α. The molecular mechanisms underlying cancer metabolism are significantly influenced by HIF-1α, however, studies on gene expression have so far failed to establish the impact of HIF-1α on tumour angiogenesis and growth. In contrast, under certain experimental conditions, PHD inhibition reconstituted tumour vessels and normalized the tumour microenvironment, which are essential for response to chemotherapy.

### Erythropoietin response to hypoxia in patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy and non-diabetic chronic renal failure [^116zWuMp]. Diabetic Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

An erythropoietin (EPO)-deficient anaemia is recognized in Type 1 diabetic patients with early nephropathy and symptomatic autonomic neuropathy (DN). The aim of this study was to determine whether the EPO response to hypoxia was deficient in order to clarify the mechanisms involved in this process.

Methods

Five Type 1 diabetic patients DN (age 39 (28–48) years (mean (range))) with EPO-deficient anaemia (haemoglobin, Hb 10.6 (9.5–12.0) g/dl, EPO 5.0 (3.2–6.5) IU/l) and early diabetic nephropathy (persistent proteinuria 1161.6 (130–2835) mg/day, serum creatinine 97.6 (63–123) micromol/l)) were compared with nine normal subjects (age 31 (24–39) years, Hb 13.4 (11.8–15.7) g/dl, EPO 7.6 (5.6–10.3) IU/l) and four patients with non-diabetic advanced chronic renal failure RF (proteinuria 2157.5 (571–4578) mg/day, serum creatinine 490.2 (406–659) micromol/l, Hb 10.3 (9.0–11.3) g/dl, EPO 4.6 (2.9–8.5) IU/l). The subjects were exposed to 6 h of hypoxia (inspired oxygen 11.6–12.6%) by breathing a gas mixture via a hood. Hourly serum EPO levels were measured.

Results

All groups showed a rise in EPO production after 2 h. The diabetic DN group achieved a similar maximal response to the normal subjects at 6 h (EPO 17.3 ± 5.4 vs. 17.8 ± 7.9 IU/l). The renal failure patients mounted an EPO response to hypoxia but at lower EPO levels.

Conclusions

Although the DN patients have inappropriately low EPO levels for the severity of their anaemia, they can mount an appropriate EPO response to moderate hypoxia. The mechanism underlying the EPO-deficient anaemia present in some diabetic patients remains unclear.

### Erythrocytosis is associated with intradialytic hypotension: a case series [^116cQMFP]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Erythrocytosis is rare in the context of end stage renal disease (ESRD). The most common erythropoietin (EPO)-dependent etiologies of erythrocytosis include malignancies, chronic hypoxia and obstructive sleep apnea, while myeloproliferative disorders account for most cases of EPO-independent erythrocytosis. However, in many instances, the mechanism of erythrocytosis in ESRD patients is unknown. Renal EPO production is stimulated by decreased oxygen carrying capacity (hemoglobin concentration x O 2 saturation x cardiac output). Because the ability to secrete EPO is diminished in chronic kidney diseases, most ESRD patients require erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) to prevent anemia. We describe five ESA-independent patients with ESRD and erythrocytosis, and associated chronic intermittent hypotension, in accordance with established case report guidelines.

### Source and microenvironmental regulation of erythropoietin in the kidney [^112kd8pL]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Historically, the identity of O2-sensing renal erythropoietin (Epo)-producing (REP) cells was a matter of debate. This review summarizes how recent breakthroughs in transgenic mouse and in-situ hybridization techniques have facilitated sensitive and specific detection of REP cells and accelerated advancements in the understanding of the regulation of renal Epo production in health and disease.

Recent Findings

REP cells are a dynamically regulated unique subpopulation of tubulointerstitial cells with features of fibroblasts, pericytes and neurons. Under normal conditions, REP cells are located in the corticomedullary border region within a steep decrement in O2 availability. During the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), REP cells cease Epo production, dedifferentiate and contribute to the progression of renal fibrosis. However, CKD patients with renal anaemia still respond with elevated Epo production following treatment with hypoxia-mimicking agents.

Summary

We hypothesize that REP cells are neuron-like setpoint providers and controllers, which integrate information about blood O2 concentration and local O2 consumption via tissue pO2, and combine these inputs with intrinsic negative feedback loops and perhaps tubular cross-talk, converging in Epo regulation.

### Translating the mechanisms of hypoxia to long-term oxygen prescription in COPD: a proposal [^111yGFAs]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Topic Importance

Current indications for long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) are primarily based on thresholds of arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2) or partial pressure (PaO 2) that ignore fundamental mechanisms of adaptation and intolerance to hypoxia. In individuals exposed to chronic hypoxic conditions, the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) in the cell nucleus up-regulates target genes that favor tolerance to hypoxia. Adaptations include hyperventilation, systemic vascular bed development, increased erythropoiesis, and cellular metabolic adjustments. Excessive responses to hypoxia may also develop, leading to pulmonary vasculature remodeling and other end-organ dysfunctions. Biomarkers of hypoxia may complement the measurement of SaO 2 or PaO 2 in personalizing oxygen prescription before end-organ dysfunction becomes clinically apparent.

Review Findings

From a scoping review of the literature, we identified several biomarkers that reflect the basic mechanisms of hypoxia at the cellular level in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although HIFs are central to these mechanisms, the determination of their plasmatic concentration for clinical purposes is currently not well validated. Candidate biomarkers to guide LTOT prescription include circulating levels of hemoglobin, erythropoietin, brain natriuretic protein and endothelin-1 as well as macroalbuminuria. Since response to oxygen may be genetically determined, genotyping may potentially serve as an additional method to personalize LTOT prescription.

Summary

Prescribing LTOT solely on SaO 2 or PaO 2 thresholds may be inappropriate. According to precision medicine principles, we propose that it should be a priority to identify early indicators of adverse reactions to chronic hypoxia, and to validate their utility in deciding who should receive LTOT.

### Hypoxia signaling in human diseases and therapeutic targets [^116hif6D]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Concluding remarks

Since the discovery of HIF1A, a hypoxia-inducible transcription factor that binds to the promotor region of EPO gene by Gregg Semenza, great progress has been made over the past two decades. In-depth studies on its isotypes and their function, its binding factors/co-activators, and its regulators have been performed. Investigations on HIF downstream signaling cascades have revealed that HIF holds an undisputed biological importance. The advancements in our knowledge are now being actively applied to the bedside — with the hope of yielding novel therapeutics. In the present review, we discussed hypoxia signaling in different diseases and organ systems. Stabilization of HIF by preconditioning/postconditioning or pharmacologic intervention displays a universally protective phenotype across all organs during acute conditions, which is supported by numerous in vivo studies and recent human clinical trials. On the other hand, modulating the HIF pathway in chronic disease conditions is considered more complex, because the effect of HIF stabilization is debatable across different studies. Nonetheless, targeting the HIF signaling pathway in chronic disease conditions still holds promise in effectively managing or delaying the progression of disease. As our understanding of the pathophysiology of diseases and its relation to hypoxia signaling deepens, we will be able to discover additional targets and niches to intervene.

### Anaemia and iron dysregulation: untapped therapeutic targets in chronic lung disease? [^117WhhLo]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Mechanisms of anaemia in chronic lung disease

The mechanisms leading to anaemia in chronic lung disease are complex and have not yet been fully characterised. Factors pertinent to ageing in general and to other populations appear to be implicated in the process; however, in the context of anaemia of chronic disease, the underlying inflammatory disease and erythropoietin (EPO) response seem the most relevant (figure 4). Inflammation in lung disease is thought to play a major role through both direct and indirect mechanisms. Inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-22, interferon-γ and tumour necrosis factor 1-α interfere with the normal function of several molecules involved in iron metabolism. These inflammatory markers are generally increased in anaemic patients with chronic lung disease and are associated with reduced serum iron levels and decreased iron availability for erythropoiesis; they are believed to do this through the destruction of red blood cell precursors and decreasing the number of EPO receptors on progenitor cells. Interestingly, this increase in inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6, is also considered to be an innate immune response to infection as it reduces iron availability for the growth of extracellular pathogens and is relevant to respiratory populations predisposed to bacterial and viral infections. Beyond the direct effects on iron metabolism, inflammatory cytokines have been found to strongly influence hepcidin production under conditions of hypoxia. Hepcidin production is normally reduced in response to hypoxia and anaemia so that erythropoietic iron demands can be fulfilled; however, in chronic inflammatory states, IL-6 induces synthesis and secretion of hepcidin by hepatocytes and consequently reduces extracellular iron availability. These different underlying causes of anaemia conferred by chronic systemic inflammation are seen in a variety of conditions, thus impairing normal corrective mechanisms and they are also relevant in chronic lung disease (figure 4).

### Dysregulated oxygen metabolism of the kidney by uremic toxins: review [^1147B9DX]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

Because kidneys consume a large amount of oxygen and are relatively inefficient in oxygen uptake, they are susceptible to hypoxia, especially in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease accompanied by loss of peritubular capillaries. Accumulating evidence suggests that chronic tubulointerstitial hypoxia acts as a final common pathway leading to end-stage renal disease. Some biologically active uremic retention molecules, considered as uremic toxins, accumulate as the renal function declines, and at this moment, more than 90 bioactive uremic toxins have been identified. Uremic toxins per se have been proven to accelerate the progression of renal failure. However, the causal relationship between uremic toxin and tubulointerstitial hypoxia remains unclear. Our studies provided direct evidence that uremic toxin dysregulates oxygen metabolism in the kidney. Indoxyl sulfate (IS), a representative protein-bound uremic toxin, increased oxygen consumption in proximal renal tubules, decreased renal oxygenation, and consequently aggravated hypoxia in the remnant rat kidneys. The increase in tubular oxygen consumption by IS was dependent on sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase and oxidative stress. Our work also indicated a possible connection between IS and the desensitization of the oxygen-sensing mechanism in erythropoietin-producing cells, which may partly explain inadequate erythropoietin production in hypoxic kidneys of end-stage renal disease patients. Studies of uremic toxins will open a new avenue in development of novel therapeutic approaches of kidney disease.

### The pleiotropic effects of erythropoietin in infection and inflammation [^113PDxGF]. Microbes and Infection (2012). Low credibility.

HIF is a heterodimeric transcription factor essential for the control of EPO expression. Whereas the amount of HIF-1α is regulated post-translationally by three PHDs, HIF-1β is constitutively expressed and assumed not to be subject to regulations. Under normoxic conditions, oxygen levels are sufficient for PHDs to continuously hydroxylate HIF-1α at two specific proline residues. Proline hydroxylation, which is modified by concentrations of ferrous iron and 2-oxoglutarate, tags HIF-1α for proteosomal degradation following binding by the von Hippel Lindau (vHL) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. During cellular hypoxia, in contrast, HIF-1α is stabilized enabling transcription of HIF target genes such as EPO and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Apart from HIF-1α, two additional isoforms exist. HIF-2α is expressed in renal fibroblasts in response to hypoxia and can dimerise with HIF-1β to drive the expression of target genes including EPOR. In contrast, due to the lack of a transcriptional activation domain in HIF-3α, this isoform suppresses the expression of hypoxia-responsive genes.

While HIF-1α and HIF-2α promote EPO expression, nuclear factor (NF)-κB inhibits it. As NF-κB is one of the central transcription factors to initiate and perpetuate inflammation, its negative effect on EPO expression in inflammatory conditions may contribute to the pathogenesis of the anemia of chronic disease (ACD), which frequently occurs in patients suffering from inflammatory diseases thereby negatively impacting on organ function and quality of life. Likewise, via stimulation of NF-κB, interleukin (IL)-1 and TNF-α can inhibit EPO expression in vitro. Accordingly, the injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into mice results in reduced expression of EPO mRNA in kidneys and decreased levels of circulating EPO. In contrast, the hepatic formation of EPO is stimulated by IL-6 in an NF-κB- and HIF-1α-dependent manner, which provides evidence for cross-regulatory interactions between inflammatory mediators and EPO formation (Fig. 1).

### Hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors for anaemia in chronic kidney disease: a clinical practice document by the European renal best practice board of the European renal association [^112mhxhw]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Anaemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with poor long-term outcomes and quality of life. The use of supplemental iron, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and blood transfusions has been the mainstay for treatment of anaemia in CKD for more than 3 decades. Despite available treatments, CKD patients with anaemia are undertreated and moderate-severe anaemia remains prevalent in the CKD population. Anaemia has consistently been associated with greater mortality, hospitalization, cardiovascular events and CKD progression in CKD patients, and the risk increases with anaemia severity. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl hydroxylase (PH) inhibitors have a novel mechanism of action by mimicking the body's response to hypoxia and have emerged as an alternative to ESAs for treatment of anaemia in CKD. Their efficacy in correcting and maintaining haemoglobin has been demonstrated in > 30 phase 3 clinical trials. Additionally, HIF activation results in various pleiotropic effects beyond erythropoiesis, with cholesterol reduction and improved iron homeostasis and potential anti-inflammatory effects. The long-term safety of these agents, particularly with respect to cardiovascular and thromboembolic events, and their possible effect on tumour growth needs to be fully elucidated. This article presents in detail the effects of HIF-PH inhibitors, describes their mechanisms of action and pharmacologic properties and discusses their place in the treatment of anaemia in CKD according to the available evidence.

### Hypoxia signaling in human diseases and therapeutic targets [^112Ma4H9]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Since the discovery of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), numerous studies on the hypoxia signaling pathway have been performed. The role of HIF stabilization during hypoxia has been extended from the induction of a single gene erythropoietin to the upregulation of a couple of hundred downstream targets, which demonstrates the complexity and importance of the HIF signaling pathway. Accordingly, HIF and its downstream targets are emerging as novel therapeutic options to treat various organ injuries. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of HIF signaling in four different organ systems, including the heart, lung, liver, and kidney. We also discuss the divergent roles of HIF in acute and chronic disease conditions and their revealed functions. Finally, we introduce some of the efforts that are being performed to translate our current knowledge in hypoxia signaling to clinical medicine.

### Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (Mircera) [^116e1Kmd]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Mircera is an erythropoietin receptor activator with greater activity in vivo as well as increased half-life, in contrast to erythropoietin. A primary growth factor for erythroid development, erythropoietin is produced in the kidney and released into the bloodstream in response to hypoxia. In responding to hypoxia, erythropoietin interacts with erythroid progenitor cells to increase red cell production. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is impaired in patients with CKD and erythropoietin deficiency is the primary cause of their anemia.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Following a single-dose of Mircera in adult patients with CKD, the onset of hemoglobin increase (defined as an increase more than 0.4 g/dL from baseline) was observed 7 to 15 days following initial dose administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

### Increase in hematocrit with SGLT-2 inhibitors-hemoconcentration from diuresis or increased erythropoiesis after amelioration of hypoxia? [^113CsaW2]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The SGLT2-inhibitors significantly reduce heart failure hospitalization and progression to end-stage kidney disease. An increase in hemoglobin/hematocrit is seen with SGLT2i-inhibitor treatment. This increase has been attributed to hemoconcentration resulting from a diuretic effect. In this review, we present evidence suggesting that the hematocrit increase is not due to hemoconcentration, but to an increase in erythropoiesis due to amelioration of hypoxia and more efficient erythropoietin production with SGLT2-inhibitor treatment.

Methods

We performed a detailed review of the literature in PubMed for articles describing various mechanisms linking hematocrit increase with SGLT2-inhibitor use to their cardio-renal benefits.

Results

The best predictor of cardio-renal benefits with SGLT2-inhibitors is an increase in hematocrit and hemoglobin. If this hemoconcentration is a results of diuresis, this would be associated with volume contraction and a deterioration in renal function, as seen with long-term diuretic use. This is the opposite of what is seen with the use of SGLT2-inhibitors, which are associated with long-term preservation of renal function. There is now growing evidence that the increase in hematocrit can be attributed to an increase in erythropoiesis due to amelioration of renal hypoxia and more efficient erythropoietin production with SGLT2-inhibitor treatment. Increased erythropoiesis leads to an increase in RBC count which improves myocardial/renal tissue oxygenation and function.

Conclusion

The increase in hematocrit with SGLT2i treatment is not due to hemoconcentration, but to an increase in erythropoiesis due to amelioration of hypoxia and more efficient erythropoietin production with SGLT2i treatment.

### Anemia in conventional hemodialysis: finding the optimal treatment balance [^112qs8TV]. Seminars in Dialysis (2018). Low credibility.

Renal anemia is a serious and common complication in hemodialysis (HD) patients. The introduction of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) has dramatically improved hemoglobin levels and outcomes. Several interventional studies reported that excessive correction of anemia and the massive use of ESA can trigger cardiovascular disease (CVD), and consequently may worsen the prognosis of patients undergoing HD. Therefore, it has been widely recognized that large doses of ESA should be used with caution. An effective use of iron preparations is required to yield the optimal effect of ESA. It is well-known that iron utilization is inhibited under pathological conditions, such as chronic inflammation, resulting in ESA resistance. It is postulated that a new class of therapeutic agents for renal anemia, hypoxia inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase (HIF-PH) inhibitors, will have beneficial treatment effects in patients on HD. HIF is induced by hypoxia and promotes erythropoietin production. In the absence of a hypoxic state, HIF is decomposed by the HIF catabolic enzyme. HIF-PH inhibitors inhibit this degrading enzyme and stimulate endogenous erythropoietin production via HIF induction. Additionally, HIF-PH inhibitors promote effective utilization of iron and raise erythropoietin to physiological concentrations. Accordingly, HIF-PH inhibitors improve anemia and iron metabolism. It appears that this effect persists irrespective of chronic inflammatory conditions. HIF-PH inhibitors do not overshoot erythropoietin above physiological concentrations like ESAs. Therefore, it is hypothesized that HIF-PH inhibitors would not increase the risk of CVD in patients undergoing HD.

### The pleiotropic effects of erythropoietin in infection and inflammation [^114R5QjH]. Microbes and Infection (2012). Low credibility.

1 EPO as central erythropoietic regulator

In its best characterized role, the renal type I cytokine erythropoietin (EPO) acts as key regulator of erythropoiesis. Thereby, EPO inhibits the apoptosis of erythroid progenitor cells by interfering with Fas Ligand (FasL)-Fas signaling, thus enabling terminal erythroid differentiation; mature erythroid cells up-regulate apoptosis-inducing ligands such as FasL and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) to suppress the production of immature progenitors by contact-dependent negative feedback mechanisms. These culminate in the cleavage of GATA1, the essential transcription factor in erythroid development, by caspases, resulting in regulated apoptotic elimination of immature erythroid precursors. By down-modulating both, FasL and Fas expression (Fig. 1), EPO increases the production of red blood cells (RBCs) and oxygen transport capacity in the circulation.

The formation of EPO is induced when peritubular fibroblasts in the kidney sense reduced oxygen tension via oxygen sensitive prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs), which in turn trans -activate the key transcription protein hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). A reduction of hemoglobin (Hb) oxygenation or levels, an increased oxygen consumption in peripheral tissues or a reduced kidney perfusion can induce renal EPO production.

However, the kidney is not the only organ which is able to adapt EPO production in response to low oxygen tension. Apparently, chronic hypoxia is also sensed in the epidermis by a HIF-dependent mechanism; nitric oxide (NO)-mediated redistribution of blood flow from inner organs to the skin results in a secondary increase in renal EPO production. Although the kidney is the pivotal production site for EPO, extra-renal EPO formation, for instance in the liver, may also insignificantly contribute to circulating EPO concentrations in adults.

### Involvement of oxygen-sensing pathways in physiologic and pathologic erythropoiesis [^113v27p6]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

Red blood cells deliver O(2) from the lungs to every cell in the human body. Reduced tissue oxygenation triggers increased production of erythropoietin by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), which is a transcriptional activator composed of an O(2)-regulated alpha subunit and a constitutively expressed beta subunit. Hydroxylation of HIF-1alpha or HIF-2alpha by the asparaginyl hydroxylase FIH-1 blocks coactivator binding and transactivation. Hydroxylation of HIF-1alpha or HIF-2alpha by the prolyl hydroxylase PHD2 is required for binding of the von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL), leading to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Mutations in the genes encoding VHL, PHD2, and HIF-2alpha have been identified in patients with familial erythrocytosis. Patients with Chuvash polycythemia, who are homozygous for a missense mutation in the VHL gene, have multisystem pathology attributable to dysregulated oxygen homeostasis. Intense efforts are under way to identify small molecule hydroxylase inhibitors that can be administered chronically to selectively induce erythropoiesis without undesirable side effects.

### Emerging erythropoiesis-stimulating agents [^111Yqf99]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2010). Medium credibility.

The stimulation of erythropoiesis is a rapidly evolving area of research, with mechanistic insights often developing rapidly into therapeutic agents. A broad range of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are currently in clinical use and many more under development are likely to enter the marketplace in the near future. To date, much of the investigative activity in this field has targeted activation of the erythropoietin receptor and factors that modulate hypoxia-related pathways of erythropoietin production within cells. This Review discusses newer erythropoiesis-stimulating agents currently under assessment for the treatment of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. Such agents include proteins and peptides that activate erythropoietin receptors, non-protein agents, and strategies with targets other than erythropoietin receptors.

### Hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor in the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease [^114BL6kC]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHIs) are orally active small molecules and are launched as novel therapeutic agents for anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD). In contrast to conventional exogenous erythropoietin (EPO) administration, HIF-PHIs stimulate endogenous EPO production and improve iron metabolism via stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). This review summarizes the mechanism of action, the results of clinical trials, and future perspectives of HIF-PHIs.

Recent Findings

Six HIF-PHIs are currently under phase III studies, some of which have been already completed. According to the results of clinical trials, HIF-PHIs increased and maintained hemoglobin levels in both nondialysis-dependent and dialysis-dependent CKD patients with physiological EPO concentrations. HIF-PHIs also improved iron utilization and were comparably effective regardless of underlying inflammation and iron status.

Summary

HIF-PHIs have several advantages including oral administration, physiological EPO secretion, and improved iron utilization. Undoubtedly, HIF-PHIs will pave the new way in the field of treatment of anemia in CKD, but it should be noted that HIFs have pleiotropic effects on a plethora of cellular functions, which might lead to either beneficial or undesirable off-target effects. Intensive postmarketing surveillance is crucially important to identify unexpected consequences.

### Altered cardiovascular defense to hypotensive stress in the chronically hypoxic fetus [^114whYsf]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

These data show that chronic hypoxia has a significant impact on the fetal cardiovascular defense to a superimposed acute hypotensive challenge, supporting the hypothesis tested in this study. Markedly impaired baroreflex responses, vagal dominant regulation of the fetal heart during acute hypotension, and diminished constrictor reactivity in the peripheral vasculature to α 1 -adrenergic stimulation provide in vivo evidence of underlying mechanisms explaining the altered cardiovascular responses in the chronically hypoxic fetus. However, the plasma catecholamine response to acute hypotension was not diminished; in fact, the fetal plasma adrenaline response to acute hypotensive stress was markedly enhanced in the chronically hypoxic relative to the normoxic fetus.

Chronic hypoxia induces the activation of the HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor), which regulates the expression of hundreds of genes including erythropoietin or EPO, which enhances red blood cell production, and this effect is measured by an increase in hematocrit. We show that exposure pregnant ewes to ca 10% O 2 for 10 days led to an increase in maternal and fetal hematocrit levels, confirming HIF activation. This level of chronic hypoxia was chosen as it reduces the fetal PaO 2 in the descending aorta from normal values of ca 20 mm Hg to values of 12 to 14 mm Hg. This magnitude of fetal chronic hypoxia is important because such fetal PaO 2 values are similar to those measured by cordocentesis in human fetuses affected by growth restriction, as reported in pioneering clinical studies. – In the present study, there was also a reduction in fetal PaCO 2 in response to chronic hypoxia. This may indicate alterations in the rate of fetal metabolism in the presence of hypoxia, minimizing fetal oxygen consumption with a consequent fall in fetal CO 2 production. Importantly, this level of maternal hypoxia did not affect maternal food intake. Therefore, the adverse effects on the fetal cardiovascular capacity to respond to acute hypotension measured in the present study are those of isolated chronic hypoxia, of levels that are human clinically relevant.

### Interplay between iron metabolism, inflammation, and EPO-ERFE-hepcidin axis in RDEB-associated chronic anemia [^114RqVtL]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

As described earlier, inflammatory signals and the restriction in iron availability impair erythropoiesis, contributing to the development of AI. In response to hypoxia, EPO secretion increases, which promotes tissue repair and the expansion of erythroblast while attenuating inflammatory signaling. Erythroblasts secrete ERFE, which disrupts bone morphogenetic protein signaling, reducing hepcidin secretion by hepatocytes and thereby allowing iron release to support erythropoiesis. However, chronic inflammatory signals can unbalance this homeostatic loop by suppressing EPO production and its downstream signaling. Thus, in chronic pathologies, this dysregulation causes inflammatory iron restriction to progress into absolute ID, making it common for AI to coexist with ID anemia (IDA). Under conditions of ID, the production of EPO in response to hypoxia is further diminished as the body attempts to conserve limited iron resources for essential functions beyond erythropoiesis. This suppression impairs the maturation of red blood cells, thereby complicating the restoration of hemoglobin levels when AI and IDA occur simultaneously.

ID and inflammation are considered the main contributors to anemia in RDEB, yet the role of specific mediators and the reasons behind the limited efficacy of current therapies remain incompletely understood. In RDEB, continuous wounding leads to unrelenting inflammation that complicates anemia recovery. However, because of the constant risk of infection, anti-inflammatory drugs are not the first line of treatment for RDEB. This situation underscores the need for alternative therapeutic strategies that specifically target iron metabolism and erythropoiesis. A deeper understanding of these under an inflammatory context could provide a foundation for the development of novel therapies for RDEB and other conditions where anemia is a prevalent comorbidity.

The modulation of the EPO-ERFE-hepcidin axis offers a promising option for anemia treatment for patients facing complex, multisystem conditions such as RDEB. However, our understanding of how these hormones function in the context of IDA and AI remains limited. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis to quantitatively assess the interrelationships among inflammatory cytokines, the EPO-ERFE-hepcidin axis, and their combined impact on iron metabolism and erythropoiesis in patients with RDEB. Through this approach, we seek to provide a rational basis for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.

Treatment of anaemia with HIF-PHI agents (Guidelines 4.1–4.9)

Hypoxia-inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHI therapy) also known as HIF stabilisers have emerged as a groundbreaking class of compounds that play a pivotal role in regulating various cellular processes.

Under hypoxic conditions, such as those encountered at high altitudes or in cases of anaemia, HIFs activate the transcription of EPO genes within the kidneys and liver, promoting erythropoiesis to enhance oxygen delivery to tissues. Additionally, HIFs mediate the expression of genes involved in iron transport, uptake, and absorption. These genes contribute to the efficient utilisation of iron, a vital element for multiple physiological processes including oxygen transport, extraction, energy production, and DNA synthesis.

In the presence of oxygen, prolyl hydroxylase enzymes hydroxylate the oxygen-regulated HIF-α subunit, thereby targeting it for proteasomal degradation. HIF-PHI therapy inhibit this proteasomal degradation, thereby stimulating erythropoiesis primarily by upregulating endogenous EPO production, promoting red blood cell production and ameliorating anaemia. Clinical studies have consistently demonstrated the efficacy and safety of HIF-PHI therapy in addressing the anaemia associated with CKD.

4 The Challenges in Estimating the Burden of Anemia at High Altitude

4.1 Physiological and Hematological Responses to High‐Altitude Hypoxia

Exposure to high‐altitude hypobaric hypoxia triggers a series of coordinated physiological and hematological adaptations aimed at preserving oxygen delivery to tissues. The decline in arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO 2) triggers chemoreceptor‐mediated hyperventilation, increasing alveolar oxygen partial pressure but also inducing respiratory alkalosis due to excessive CO 2 elimination. This alkalosis initially dampens the ventilatory response but is gradually counteracted by renal bicarbonate excretion, allowing sustained hyperventilation over time. Concurrently, sympathetic nervous system activation elevates heart rate and cardiac output, temporarily enhancing oxygen delivery to tissues.

Another acute response to altitude is a reduction in plasma volume, which leads to a significant increase in hematocrit and Hb concentration, alongside a decrease in total blood volume. This plasma volume contraction, driven by complex fluid regulation mechanisms, contributes to the partial normalization of arterial oxygen content within the first few days of exposure. Plasma volume generally remains reduced throughout the duration of altitude exposure. In parallel, elevated circulating erythropoietin (EPO) stimulates erythropoiesis in the bone marrow, promoting increased red blood cell production and a resulting rise in Hb concentration, thereby enhancing further the blood's oxygen‐carrying capacity and contributing to the normalization of cardiac output. Therefore, lowlanders acclimatizing at high altitudes as well as permanent high‐altitude residents, generally exhibit elevated Hb concentrations. These physiological adaptations are driven by a cascade of molecular events initiated by oxygen‐sensing pathways, particularly the stabilization of hypoxia‐inducible factors (HIF‐1α and HIF‐2α), which upregulate the transcription of EPO in the kidneys and liver. Under sustained hypoxic conditions, additional layers of physiological and genetic adaptations emerge, contributing to long‐term acclimatization in high‐altitude populations.

### Renal parenchymal hypoxia, hypoxia response and the progression of chronic kidney disease [^115XAwJE]. American Journal of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Renal parenchymal hypoxia, documented under a variety of clinical conditions, conceivably contributes to the progression chronic kidney disease. In this review, normal physiologic medullary hypoxia and abnormal profiles of renal pO(2) in chronic kidney diseases are presented, and the mechanisms leading to anomalous renal tissue oxygenation are discussed. Direct measurements of pO(2) with oxygen electrodes, immunostaining with pimonidazole (which binds to regions with very low pO(2)), or the detection of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-alpha (which accumulates in hypoxic regions, initiating hypoxia-adaptive responses), all serve to detect the distribution and extent of renal parenchymal hypoxia under experimental settings. The use of BOLD MRI as a noninvasive tool, detecting deoxygenated hemoglobin in hypoxic renal tissues, has evolved from experimental settings to human studies. All these modalities indicate that abnormal renal oxygenation develops under conditions such as chronic glomerular, tubulointerstitial or renovascular disease, in diabetes, hypertension, aging, renal hypertrophy, anemia or obstructive uropathy. Abnormal renal tissue hypoxia modifies the pattern of regional gene expression, evoking a host of adaptive and renoprotective pathways (such as HIF-mediated erythropoietin or heme-oxygenase-1), in parallel with the induction of potentially harmful mediators that participate in the progression of chronic kidney injury. Slowing the progression of chronic kidney disease may be achieved by a better understanding of these parallel processes and the accomplishment of a selective control of such protective and maladaptive responses.

### Hypoxia-inducible factor stabilizers for treating anemia of chronic kidney disease [^115qfESn]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Small-molecule inhibitors of prolyl hydroxylase domain enzymes (PHD inhibitors) are novel renal anemia therapies that increase endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) production by stabilizing hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). This review summarizes recent findings and future perspectives of PHD inhibitors (HIF stabilizers) in chronic kidney disease (CKD)-associated anemia.

Recent Findings

Clinical trials have demonstrated that HIF stabilizers effectively increase hemoglobin levels of both nondialysis and dialysis CKD patients without causing serious adverse effects. HIF stabilizers not only restore EPO production but also optimize iron metabolism by reducing hepcidin levels. Considering the pleiotropic roles of the PHD-HIF pathway, HIF stabilizers might have both advantageous and disadvantageous effects in humans, in addition to erythropoiesis. Results of studies in animal models have suggested that HIF stabilizers alleviate ischemia-reperfusion injury and play protective roles against metabolic diseases. In contrast, a theoretical concern exists regarding the potential for tumorigenesis due to HIF stabilization.

Summary

At least five HIF stabilizers are now in phase III trials and may appear on the market in 1–2 years. The long-term effects and safety of HIF stabilization should be carefully examined in future basic and clinical studies.

### Erythropoietin response in critically ill mechanically ventilated patients: a prospective observational study [^112nwW9Q]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Krafte-Jacobs and coworkers demonstrated a blunted EPO response in critically ill pediatric patients with acute anemia and acute hypoxia. Enrolled patients included 21 with acute anemia, 18 with acute hypoxemia (normal hemoglobin), 10 critically ill without anemia or hypoxemia, and 21 outpatients with chronic anemia but no acute illness. Hemoglobin levels were equivalent in the acutely anemic and chronically anemic patients. The EPO levels were similar in the acutely anemic, acutely hypoxemic, and critically ill control patients, but significantly less than the EPO levels in the chronically anemic patients. The authors concluded that the EPO response to known physiologic stimuli is blunted in critically ill children.

Hobisch-Hagen and coworkers found no correlation between EPO and hemoglobin concentrations in 23 adult patients suffering from severe trauma. That observational study did not include a control group for comparison. Trauma patients exhibited anemia (mean hemoglobin 10.0 g/dl) on admission without significant increase during the period of observation. The mean EPO level was 49.8 U/l on day 1 without significant increase throughout the study period (to day 9). The authors concluded that patients with multiple trauma exhibit an inadequate EPO response to low hemoglobin concentrations.

### Anemia of chronic renal disease… [^115jYHh7]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The pathogenesis of the anemia of chronic renal disease is related to the etiology of the renal disease, to the failure of renal excretory function, and to the failure of renal endocrine function. Failure of the renal excretory function leads to an increased demand for red blood cells because of shortening of the red blood cell life-span, impaired utilization of iron, decreased responsiveness to erythropoietin and increased blood loss. Failure of renal endocrine function leads to a decreased erythropoietic response to these demands because of impaired production of erythropoietin. A greater degree of anemic hypoxia is required to generate the necessary amount of erythropoietin, and an equilibrium between demand and supply is first established at anemic levels. Erslev AJ. Anemia of Chronic Renal Disease. Arch Intern Med. 1970; 126: 774–780.

### Mechanisms of enhanced renal and hepatic erythropoietin synthesis by sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors [^116byQWw]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce the risk of major heart failure events, an action that is statistically linked to enhanced erythropoiesis, suggesting that stimulation of erythropoietin and cardioprotection are related to a shared mechanism. Four hypotheses have been proposed to explain how these drugs increase erythropoietin production: (i) renal cortical reoxygenation with rejuvenation of erythropoietin-producing cells; (ii) counterregulatory distal sodium reabsorption leading to increased tubular workload and oxygen consumption, and thus, to localized hypoxia; (iii) increased iron mobilization as a stimulus of hypoxia-inducible factor-2α (HIF-2α)-mediated erythropoietin synthesis; and (iv) direct HIF-2α activation and enhanced erythropoietin gene transcription due to increased sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) signaling. The first two hypotheses assume that the source of increased erythropoietin is the interstitial fibroblast-like cells in the deep renal cortex. However, SGLT2 inhibitors do not alter regional tissue oxygen tension in the non-diabetic kidney, and renal erythropoietin synthesis is markedly impaired in patients with anemia due to chronic kidney disease, and yet, SGLT2 inhibitors produce an unattenuated erythrocytic response in these patients. This observation raises the possibility that the liver contributes to the production of erythropoietin during SGLT2 inhibition. Hypoxia-inducible factor-2α and erythropoietin are coexpressed not only in the kidney but also in hepatocytes; the liver is a major site of production when erythropoietin stimulation is maintained for prolonged periods. The ability of SGLT2 inhibitors to improve iron mobilization by derepressing hepcidin and ferritin would be expected to increase cytosolic ferrous iron, which might stimulate HIF-2α expression in both the kidney and liver through the action of iron regulatory protein 1. Alternatively, the established ability of SGLT2 inhibitors to enhance SIRT1 might be the mechanism of enhanced erythropoietin production with these drugs. In hepatic cell lines, SIRT1 can directly activate HIF-2α by deacetylation, and additionally, through an effect of SIRT in the liver, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α binds to hepatic nuclear factor 4 to promote transcription of the erythropoietin gene and synthesis of erythropoietin. Since SIRT1 up-regulation exerts direct cytoprotective effects on the heart and stimulates erythropoietin, it is well-positioned to represent the shared mechanism that links erythropoiesis to cardioprotection during SGLT2 inhibition.

Regulation of erythropoietin production in the kidney and liver

During fetal development, the major site of erythropoietin production is the liver, whereas in adults, erythropoietin is largely synthesized by peritubular fibroblast-like type-1 interstitial cells, located primarily in the deep renal cortex; at both sites, erythropoietin production is exquisitely sensitive to tissue oxygen tension. A major difference between erythropoietin production in the kidney and liver is that hepatocytes can increase synthesis at a cellular level, whereas in the kidney, increased erythropoietin synthesis is achieved by proliferation of the peritubular fibroblast-like type-1 interstitial cells, each producing a fixed quantity of erythropoietin messenger RNA.

In both the kidney and the liver, the major stimulus to the production of erythropoietin is hypoxia-inducible factor-2α (HIF-2α), which is expressed in the same cells that manufacture erythropoietin. Coexpression of HIF-2α links erythropoietin synthesis to oxygen levels, since HIF-2α is degraded by prolyl hydroxylases that are stabilized by ambient levels of oxygen. In addition, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4), which is also oxygen-sensitive, promotes transcription of the erythropoietin gene and may maintain tissue specificity of erythropoietin expression.

With the onset of anemia and in the absence of kidney disease, the proliferation of interstitial cells extends the production of erythropoietin throughout the entire renal cortex. However, during the evolution and progression of chronic kidney disease, the interstitial cells are transformed into myofibroblasts that can no longer synthesize erythropoietin, but they can drive the development of renal fibrosis. Hepatic production of erythropoietin contributes importantly to systemic levels, if renal sources are impaired or if its synthesis is markedly stimulated, genetically or pharmacologically, for long periods. During prolonged stimulated erythropoiesis in animals with normal renal functionor during prolyl hydroxylase inhibition for the treatment of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease, the liver emerges as the primary site of erythropoietin production. It is not known if the heightened synthesis of erythropoietin during SGLT2 inhibition is primarily renal or hepatic, especially during long-term therapy. However, it is noteworthy that the magnitude of erythrocytosis during SGLT2 inhibition is not attenuated in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rates < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or in patients who have anemia of chronic kidney disease. Since the renal synthesis of erythropoietin in these patients is severely compromised, it seems likely that the liver contributes importantly to the synthesis of erythropoietin seen during SGLT2 inhibition.

### Hypoxia-inducible erythropoietin expression: details matter [^115eK9AU]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) and its derivatives are some of the most important treatment options against anemia associated with chronic kidney disease, chemotherapy, and low-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. On the other hand, it has also gained fame as a doping agent in endurance sports. All this became possible by translating basic research findings that started more than 100 years ago with the recognition of an increase in red blood cell number in animals living at high altitude (i.e. at a decreased pO 2) and that went, via purification, partial sequencing, cloning, and basic understanding of EPO gene regulation, into clinics (for excellent reviews of EPO history see).

With its cloning and the fast-improving molecular biological tools, findings from hypoxia-inducible EPO gene regulation also became a paradigm to understand basic principles of how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability. The discovery of those principles were acknowledged by part of the 2019 Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine.

### Anaemia in kidney disease: harnessing hypoxia responses for therapy [^113sKdyK]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2015). Medium credibility.

Improved understanding of the oxygen-dependent regulation of erythropoiesis has provided new insights into the pathogenesis of anaemia associated with renal failure and has led to the development of novel therapeutic agents for its treatment. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-2 is a key regulator of erythropoiesis and iron metabolism. HIF-2 is activated by hypoxic conditions and controls the production of erythropoietin by renal peritubular interstitial fibroblast-like cells and hepatocytes. In anaemia associated with renal disease, erythropoiesis is suppressed due to inadequate erythropoietin production in the kidney, inflammation and iron deficiency; however, pharmacologic agents that activate the HIF axis could provide a physiologic approach to the treatment of renal anaemia by mimicking hypoxia responses that coordinate erythropoiesis with iron metabolism. This Review discusses the functional inter-relationships between erythropoietin, iron and inflammatory mediators under physiologic conditions and in relation to the pathogenesis of renal anaemia, as well as recent insights into the molecular and cellular basis of erythropoietin production in the kidney. It furthermore provides a detailed overview of current clinical experience with pharmacologic activators of HIF signalling as a novel comprehensive and physiologic approach to the treatment of anaemia.

### Long-term and stable correction of uremic anemia by intramuscular injection of plasmids containing hypoxia-regulated system of erythropoietin expression [^113m18TZ]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Anemia is a frequent complication of chronic renal failure (CRF). Insufficient production of glycoprotein hormone erythropoietin (Epo) is a main causative factor of uremic anemia. Currently, regular administration of recombinant erythropoietin (rEpo) and its newer derivatives, such as derivatives of rEpo-α and -β, is the main clinical treatment, and millions of patients have benefited from it. Yet recent studies revealed some adverse effects of this treatment, for example, mortality and cardiovascular complications due to the use of epoetin and pure red cell aplasia induced by newer derivatives. These thorny problems have not been settled so far.

Epo gene therapy is another treatment and still under investigation at present. Previous studies proved that direct transfer of Epo gene into the host via either viral or nonviral means could allow sustained Epo secretion to correct the renal anemia. But this transfer may lead to constant and high-level production of Epo and even to potentially lethal polycythemia, because the transferred Epo gene was not under the control of physiologic hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). Temporal control systems of transgene expression were proved to be able to avoid deleterious Epo secretion. Yet these systems are complicated in repeated administration and calculating the doses of therapeutic gene.

### Erythropoietic response in chronic pulmonary disease… [^114CGU3d]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Interest in the erythropoietic response in patients with chronic lung disease stems from the fact that, despite arterial hypoxia, the hemoglobin concentration is usually normal. 1–6 Hypoxia under almost all other conditions is associated with a secondary polycythemia. In natives of the Peruvian Andes, Hurtado and co-workers clearly demonstrated that prolonged exposure to high altitudes will produce an increase in hemoglobin and hematocrit proportional to the degree of hypoxia. 7 Similarly, it has been observed that patients with arterial hypoxemia due to cyanotic heart disease8, 9 and occasionally due to chronic pulmonary disease have secondary polycythemia. The apparent lack of erythropoietic response in most patients with chronic pulmonary disease has not been explained adequately.

Recently it has been emphasized that, if total red cell volume is measured rather than peripheral hemoglobin and hematocrit, patients with chronic pulmonary disease will demonstrate an adequate erythropoietic response. 10 However, the reported data.

### An acetate switch regulates stress erythropoiesis [^112kGMyr]. Nature Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

The hormone erythropoietin (EPO), which is synthesized in the kidney or liver of adult mammals, controls erythrocyte production and is regulated by the stress-responsive transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-2 (HIF-2). We previously reported that the lysine acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein (CBP) is required for HIF-2α acetylation and efficient HIF-2-dependent EPO induction during hypoxia. We now show that these processes require acetate-dependent acetyl CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2). In human Hep3B hepatoma cells and in EPO-generating organs of hypoxic or acutely anemic mice, acetate levels rise and ACSS2 is required for HIF-2α acetylation, CBP-HIF-2α complex formation, CBP-HIF-2α recruitment to the EPO enhancer and efficient induction of EPO gene expression. In acutely anemic mice, acetate supplementation augments stress erythropoiesis in an ACSS2-dependent manner. Moreover, in acquired and inherited chronic anemia mouse models, acetate supplementation increases EPO expression and the resting hematocrit. Thus, a mammalian stress-responsive acetate switch controls HIF-2 signaling and EPO induction during pathophysiological states marked by tissue hypoxia.

### Targeting hypoxia-inducible factors for the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease patients [^116SCXGz]. American Journal of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Anemia, a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD), has previously been attributed primarily to decreased production of erythropoietin. More recently, it has become apparent that the etiology of anemia involves several other factors, most notably dysfunctional iron metabolism, mediated via increased hepcidin activity and reduced clearance. Current management of anemia in patients with advanced CKD is based on erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and iron supplementation, along with red blood cell transfusions when necessary; however, safety considerations associated with these therapies highlight the need to pursue alternative treatment options targeting other mechanisms such as hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) that act as central regulators of erythropoiesis by coordinating a series of graded hypoxic responses.

Summary

This review discusses the discovery of the HIF pathway and its regulation via HIF prolyl hydroxylase enzymes in the context of erythropoiesis and iron metabolism. The rationale for targeting this pathway and the clinical development of HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors are reviewed, with a commentary on the potential implications of this class of agents in CKD anemia management. Key Messages: Pharmacologic activation of the HIF pathway results in a transient pseudo-hypoxic state that stimulates erythropoiesis in CKD patients with anemia. Results from clinical studies of a number of HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors are increasingly available and provide support for the continued evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio of this novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of anemia in CKD.

### Anemia and chronic kidney disease are potential risk factors for mortality in stroke patients: a historic cohort study [^1149QNiJ]. BMC Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

There are different reasons why anemia and chronic kidney disease could be risk factors for mortality: chronic anemia involves hemodynamic compensations, for example an increase in heart rate, cardiac index and stroke work, as well as an amplification of hypoxia. These compensations stress the ventricular function and worsen the dysfunction among patients with heart failure and, thus, could consequently increase the risk of death. Anemia is associated with changes in left ventricular anatomy among patients with CKD, a change that could also increase death rates. Furthermore, reduced hemoglobin may be associated with other risk factors of cardio-vascular mortality and it may result in worsening ischemia by amplifying hypoxia. Several studies have demonstrated that the level of kidney function is a significant risk factor for all cause mortality in patients with heart failure and hypothesized several explanations. For example, reduced kidney function may be associated with other risk factors for mortality. In addition, kidney disease may be a risk factor for the progression of cardiac dysfunction by worsening fluid and sodium retention, thus fostering left ventricular dilatation and hypertrophy, a strong predictor of stroke risk. Furthermore CKD may induce other pathophysiologic processes that may increase stroke risk, like inducing oxidative stress, which could promote atherosclerosis. These elements may contribute to cerebral ischemia and increase the risk of ischemic stroke. Moreover, risk factors for stroke, such as diabetes, hypertension or cardiovascular diseases are more common among dialysis patients and uremia causes accelerated atherosclerotic vascular disease. One study showed that increased aortic stiffness among CKD patients was an explanation why CKD is a predictor of cardio- and cerebrovascular mortality.

Most patients with ESRD and even less severe kidney dysfunction are anemic because of a deficient erythropoietin production. Erythropoietin was shown to have neuronal protective effects in animal models of ischemia-induced stroke and brain injury. When renal function is reduced, erythropoietin production is impaired, which could limit erythropoietin-induced neuronal protection against anemia-induced stroke. Thus, the combination of anemia and CKD could interact to make a stroke event more likely to occur or more likely to be clinically severe. Furthermore, it was shown that hemodialysis patients have better outcomes than patients suffering from renal insufficiency but getting no treatment. However, patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis have a greater risk of stroke than the general population. This is explainable by a poor control of hypertension, which is presumably partly due to over-hydration in patients getting peritoneal dialysis.

### Long-term reversal of chronic anemia using a hypoxia-regulated erythropoietin gene therapy [^114UKMqP]. Blood (2002). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common clinical problem, and there is much interest in its role in promoting left ventricular hypertrophy through increasing cardiac workload. Normally, red blood cell production is adjusted through the regulation of erythropoietin (Epo) production by the kidney. One important cause of anemia is relative deficiency of Epo, which occurs in most types of renal disease. Clinically, this can be corrected by supplementation with recombinant Epo. Here we describe an oxygen-regulated gene therapy approach to treating homozygous erythropoietin-SV40 T antigen (Epo-TAg(h)) mice with relative erythropoietin deficiency. We used vectors in which murine Epo expression was directed by an Oxford Biomedica hypoxia response element (OBHRE) or a constitutive cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. Both corrected anemia, but CMV-Epo-treated mice acquired fatal polycythemia. In contrast, OBHRE-Epo corrected the hematocrit level in anemic mice to a normal physiologic level that stabilized without resulting in polycythemia. Importantly, the OBHRE-Epo vector had no significant effect on the hematocrit of control mice. Homozygous Epo-TAg(h) mice display cardiac hypertrophy, a common adaptive response in patients with chronic anemia. In the OBHRE-Epo-treated Epo-TAg(h) mice, we observed a significant reversal of cardiac hypertrophy. We conclude that the OBHRE promoter gives rise to physiologically regulated Epo secretion such that the hematocrit level is corrected to healthy in anemic Epo-TAg(h) mice. This establishes that a hypoxia regulatory mechanism similar to the natural mechanism can be achieved, and it makes EPO gene therapy more attractive and safer in clinical settings. We envisage that this control system will allow regulated delivery of therapeutic gene products in other ischemic settings.

### HIF-2alpha regulates murine hematopoietic development in an erythropoietin-dependent manner [^1143EcYD]. Blood (2005). Low credibility.

Erythropoiesis in the adult mammal depends critically on erythropoietin, an inducible cytokine with pluripotent effects. Erythropoietin gene expression increases under conditions associated with lowered oxygen content such as anemia and hypoxia. HIF-1alpha, the founding member of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) alpha class, was identified by its ability to bind and activate the hypoxia-responsive enhancer in the erythropoietin regulatory region in vitro. The existence of multiple HIF alpha members raises the question of which HIF alpha member or members regulates erythropoietin expression in vivo. We previously reported that mice lacking wild-type HIF-2alpha, encoded by the EPAS1 gene, exhibit pancytopenia. In this study, we have characterized the etiology of this hematopoietic phenotype. Molecular studies of EPAS1-null kidneys reveal dramatically decreased erythropoietin gene expression. EPAS1-null as well as heterozygous mice have impaired renal erythropoietin induction in response to hypoxia. Treatment of EPAS1-null mice with exogenous erythropoietin reverses the hematopoietic and other defects. We propose that HIF-2alpha is an essential regulator of murine erythropoietin production. Impairments in HIF signaling, involving either HIF-1alpha or HIF-2alpha, may play a prominent role in conditions involving altered hematopoietic or erythropoietin homeostasis.

### Mutual antagonism of hypoxia-inducible factor isoforms in cardiac, vascular, and renal disorders [^115YVASv]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

HIF-1α and HIF-2α exert mutually antagonistic effects on the redox state and on proinflammatory pathways. Although the short-term actions of HIF-1α can reduce hypoxia-related injury, prolonged signaling through HIF-1α leads to increases in oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis, but these deleterious effects are opposed by the actions of HIF-2α. The interplay between HIF-1α and HIF-2α may contribute to the evolution and progression of chronic heart failure, atherosclerotic and hypertensive vascular disorders, and chronic kidney disease. These disorders are characterized by activation of HIF-1α and suppression of HIF-2α; the latter effect explains why many chronic inflammatory diseases decrease the production of erythropoietin and cause anemia. Hypoxia mimetics are capable of potentiating both HIF-1α and HIF-2α; ideally, such agents should act preferentially to promote HIF-2α while exerting little effect on or acting to suppress HIF-1α. Selective upregulation of HIF-2α can be achieved with drugs that inhibit isoform-selective PHDs or that promote the actions of SIRT1 (i.e. SGLT2 inhibitors). Augmentation of SIRT1 and HIF-2α signaling may explain the link between the proerythrocytic action of SGLT2 inhibitors and their cardioprotective effects.

### The pleiotropic effects of erythropoietin in infection and inflammation [^1174NZjd]. Microbes and Infection (2012). Low credibility.

5 Perspective

The primary physiological function of the EPO-EPOR system is to stimulate bone marrow production of erythroid progenitors in response to renal hypoxemia, thus maintaining an adequate systemic availability of RBCs as oxygen carriers.

Numerous studies have revealed previously less appreciated roles of EPO-EPOR signaling, for instance at sites of tissue damage and inflammation. Administration of EPO exerts disease-modifying effects in animal models of traumatic, ischemic or toxic injury to the nervous, digestive and cardiopulmonary systems. However, the potential therapeutic benefits of EPO therapy in humans are currently outweighed by its primary erythropoietic effects since the expansion of the RBC mass increases the risk of thromboembolic complications and is under certain circumstances associated with an adverse clinical course. Thus, EPO derivatives without erythropoietic effects have been developed.

Recent studies have characterized EPO as a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine in chronic inflammatory disorders and infectious diseases. Specifically, EPO down-regulates pro-inflammatory immune effector pathways in response to chemical tissue damage, LPS stimulation and Salmonella infection. However, the expression of anti-inflammatory mediators such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, IL-10, IL-27, IL-35 and adiponectin are not regulated by EPO treatment at least in the mouse models investigated so far, implying that EPO is a direct anti-inflammatory mediator. In addition, EPO may affect immune cell differentiation and proliferation and it will be of importance to determine such immune-regulatory effects in regard to T cell differentiation or macrophage polarization (M1 versus M2 phenotype) under inflammatory conditions and in cancer models in vivo.

Role of erythropoietin (EPO) in IBD-associated anemia notes that EPO is a hematopoietic cytokine produced by kidney cells in response to hypoxia; recombinant human EPO is approved by the FDA for patients whose anemia is associated with chronic renal failure, HIV, and chemotherapy, and EPO has also been used to treat ACD in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and IBD, with several small studies in adults with IBD showing treatment responses with increase in Hgb levels and improvement in quality of life.

### Stimulation of erythropoietin release by hypoxia and hypoxemia: similar but different [^111fpCpN]. Kidney International (2019). Medium credibility.

Erythropoietin is released from the kidney in response to tissue hypoxia. Montero and Lundby found that increases in plasma erythropoietin induced by reducing arterial oxygen content in healthy humans were independent of arterial oxygen tension. Their observations accord with the established physiology of kidney oxygenation and can be predicted by a computational model of renal oxygen transport. However, model simulations indicate that the interpretation implicit in the title of their paper may be an oversimplification.

### Emerging EPO and EPO receptor regulators and signal transducers [^113WWXWN]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

As essential mediators of red cell production, erythropoietin (EPO) and its cell surface receptor (EPO receptor [EPOR]) have been intensely studied. Early investigations defined basic mechanisms for hypoxia-inducible factor induction of EPO expression, and within erythroid progenitors EPOR engagement of canonical Janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (JAK2/STAT5), rat sarcoma/mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (RAS/MEK/ERK), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Contemporary genetic, bioinformatic, and proteomic approaches continue to uncover new clinically relevant modulators of EPO and EPOR expression, and EPO's biological effects. This Spotlight review highlights such factors and their emerging roles during erythropoiesis and anemia.

### Mechanisms of hypoxia signalling: new implications for nephrology [^116zD9Rz]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

Studies of the regulation of erythropoietin (EPO) production by the liver and kidneys, one of the classical physiological responses to hypoxia, led to the discovery of human oxygen-sensing mechanisms, which are now being targeted therapeutically. The oxygen-sensitive signal is generated by 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases that deploy molecular oxygen as a co-substrate to catalyse the post-translational hydroxylation of specific prolyl and asparaginyl residues in hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), a key transcription factor that regulates transcriptional responses to hypoxia. Hydroxylation of HIF at different sites promotes both its degradation and inactivation. Under hypoxic conditions, these processes are suppressed, enabling HIF to escape destruction and form active transcriptional complexes at thousands of loci across the human genome. Accordingly, HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors stabilize HIF and stimulate expression of HIF target genes, including the EPO gene. These molecules activate endogenous EPO gene expression in diseased kidneys and are being developed, or are already in clinical use, for the treatment of renal anaemia. In this Review, we summarize information on the molecular circuitry of hypoxia signalling pathways underlying these new treatments and highlight some of the outstanding questions relevant to their clinical use.

### Increased plasma levels of erythropoietin after renal denervation in patients with resistant hypertension [^1169C3UL]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Erythropoietin (Epo) is a glycoprotein hormone that plays a crucial role in the formation and maturation of erythrocytes, and the major site of Epo production is the peritubular fibroblasts located within the renal cortex. It is generally accepted that Epo levels increase following an anaemic or hypoxaemic stimulus. The kidney is particularly sensitive to both hypoxia and hypovolemia, and is thus uniquely situated to sense when an increase in oxygen-carrying capacity is required. The loss of Epo production, downstream of pericyte transdifferentiation to non-Epo producing myofibroblasts, provokes significant anaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. Renal sympathetic innervation, and renal sympathetic nerve activity itself, are considered important extrarenal modulators of Epo production. Mechanistically, it is poorly understood exactly how interactions between sympathetic fibres and peritubular fibroblasts occur. Regardless, sympathetic control appears to be a clinically relevant modulator of Epo production, given the observation that anaemia in primary autonomic failure is independent of haematinic concentrations and is corrected by Epo supplementation. Indeed, in the acute phase following haemorrhage, in which RSNA paradoxically falls, there is increased transcription and production of Epo.

Earlier studies investigating the role of renal nerves have shown conflicting results. Beynon demonstrated that the serum level of Epo of hypoxic rats was increased by section of the renal nerves. Gebhard et al. reported that renal denervation (RDN) increased Epo secretion stimulated by carbon monoxide in rats. A recent study showed Epo was increased after 120 min of transient hypotensive haemorrhage in RDN rats in normoxic conditions. Others had contrasting results. Fink et al found that Epo levels were markedly reduced by prior surgical denervation of both kidneys within 5 h. In a recent report, unilaterally denervated rats were exposed to different hypoxic stimuli, but no differences in Epo mRNA levels were found when innervated and denervated kidneys were compared. As such, there remains significant conflict in the literature around the role of renal sympathetic innervation and Epo production.

### Hepatic HIF-2 regulates erythropoietic responses to hypoxia in renal anemia [^111LHNnK]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

The kidney is the main physiologic source of erythropoietin (EPO) in the adult and responds to decreases in tissue oxygenation with increased EPO production. Although studies in mice with liver-specific or global gene inactivation have shown that hypoxia-inducible factor 2 (Hif-2) plays a major role in the regulation of Epo during infancy and in the adult, respectively, the contribution of renal HIF-2 signaling to systemic EPO homeostasis and the role of extrarenal HIF-2 in erythropoiesis, in the absence of kidney EPO, have not been examined directly. Here, we used Cre-loxP recombination to ablate Hif-2α in the kidney, whereas Hif-2-mediated hypoxia responses in the liver and other Epo-producing tissues remained intact. We found that the hypoxic induction of renal Epo is completely Hif-2 dependent and that, in the absence of renal Hif-2, hepatic Hif-2 takes over as the main regulator of serum Epo levels. Furthermore, we provide evidence that hepatocyte-derived Hif-2 is involved in the regulation of iron metabolism genes, supporting a role for HIF-2 in the coordination of EPO synthesis with iron homeostasis.

Given the experience with ESAs, there may be reservations about targeting Hb levels > 11 g/dL; however, considering physiological and clinical differences, it may not be appropriate to extrapolate considerations from other populations to patients with chronic lung disease. As with CKD, patients with chronic lung disease are predisposed to increased CV morbidity and mortality. The current limits (to not start rhEPO unless Hb < 10 g/dL) with rhEPO treatment in CKD where there is not a primary driver for hypoxia beyond the anaemia itself make development of rhEPO in the chronic lung disease population challenging given that most of the population are not anaemic. In this regard, it is relevant that the benefit:risk considerations in chronic lung disease are different from CKD, given the key synergistic impacts of impaired pulmonary gas exchange and O 2 carriage in this population where there is no established treatment option for anaemia of chronic disease. Clinical studies have demonstrated that treatment with HIF-PHIs is associated with plasma EPO levels that remain within the physiological range for the CKD patient population, and hence risks associated with supraphysiological EPO levels may be significantly lower. Improved O 2 content through improved Hb may improve cardiovascular outcomes in chronic lung disease at higher Hb levels, given the increased cardiac risk, especially during periods of strain such as hospitalisations that are associated with hypoxia and an increased risk of anaemia. Consistent with the variable impact of impaired O 2 delivery through reduced Hb in different populations, despite potential safety concerns in CKD, a meta-analysis has demonstrated a reduction in hospitalisations in chronic heart failurein the absence of any mortality benefit with rhEPO in this population.

In conclusion, anaemia and dysregulated iron metabolism are prevalent in chronic lung disease, and in the setting of impaired O 2 delivery in patients who have a limited ability to compensate, there is associated morbidity and mortality. Therapies used in other disease areas may have particular benefits in this population. Given changes in standards of care, clinical features in chronic lung disease are evolving and newer therapies may provide opportunities to deliver improved outcomes in chronic lung disease. Given differences in populations and the ongoing morbidity and mortality burden, studies in chronic lung disease are warranted to confirm any benefit to treating anaemia and dysregulated iron metabolism and to mitigate any theoretical safety risks that extend from the literature and other populations.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^114BeEnz]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (treatment targets), UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider achieving a hemoglobin level between 100 and 120 g/L in patients aged ≥ 18 years with non-dialysis dependent CKD on hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor therapy, similar to ESA therapy.

### Prolyl hydroxylase domain inhibitors as a novel therapeutic approach against anemia in chronic kidney disease [^115v93EM]. Kidney International (2017). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease and is mainly caused by the inability of injured kidneys to produce adequate amounts of erythropoietin. Studies elucidating the regulation of erythropoietin production led to the identification of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), which activates the transcription of genes that mediate adaptive responses to hypoxia. HIF is a heterodimer that consists of an α and β subunit. While HIF-β is constitutively expressed, HIF-α is subjected to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation under normoxic conditions. This process is mediated by prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins, the inhibition of which results in an increased expression of hypoxia-induced genes, including erythropoietin. These findings led to the development of prolyl hydroxylase domain inhibitors as novel therapeutic agents against anemia in chronic kidney disease. Prolyl hydroxylase domain inhibition improves iron metabolism, which also contributes to erythropoiesis. To date, at least 6 small-molecule inhibitors of the prolyl hydroxylase domain have been tested in humans, and clinical trials have shown that they are effective without causing serious adverse events. However, there is a theoretical concern that the systemic activation of HIF could also induce deleterious effects such as tumorigenesis and severe pulmonary hypertension, which demands careful assessments in future clinical studies.

### Erythropoietic effects of vadadustat in patients with anemia associated with chronic kidney disease [^113ubhsj]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) develop anemia largely because of inappropriately low erythropoietin (EPO) production and insufficient iron available to erythroid precursors. In four phase 3, randomized, open-label, clinical trials in dialysis-dependent and non-dialysis-dependent patients with CKD and anemia, the hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, vadadustat, was noninferior to the erythropoiesis-stimulating agent, darbepoetin alfa, in increasing and maintaining target hemoglobin concentrations. In these trials, vadadustat increased the concentrations of serum EPO, the numbers of circulating erythrocytes, and the numbers of circulating reticulocytes. Achieved hemoglobin concentrations were similar in patients treated with either vadadustat or darbepoetin alfa, but compared with patients receiving darbepoetin alfa, those receiving vadadustat had erythrocytes with increased mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin, while the red cell distribution width was decreased. Increased serum transferrin concentrations, as measured by total iron-binding capacity, combined with stable serum iron concentrations, resulted in decreased transferrin saturation in patients randomized to vadadustat compared with patients randomized to darbepoetin alfa. The decreases in transferrin saturation were associated with relatively greater declines in serum hepcidin and ferritin in patients receiving vadadustat compared with those receiving darbepoetin alfa. These results for serum transferrin saturation, hepcidin, ferritin, and erythrocyte indices were consistent with improved iron availability in the patients receiving vadadustat. Thus, overall, vadadustat had beneficial effects on three aspects of erythropoiesis in patients with anemia associated with CKD: increased endogenous EPO production, improved iron availability to erythroid cells, and increased reticulocytes in the circulation.

### Anaemia and iron dysregulation: untapped therapeutic targets in chronic lung disease? [^111JbqJj]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Small molecules which inhibit hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl-4-hydroxylases, preventing the breakdown of the HIF transcription factor, are currently in development. In preclinical studies, HIF stabilisation results in the accumulation of HIF and upregulation of HIF-responsive genes. This biological activity simulates multiple components of the natural tissue response to hypoxia, including erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, immune modulation and enhanced cell survival. Agents targeting HIF stabilisation have been shown to induce endogenous EPO production and improve markers of iron metabolism, resulting in erythropoiesis and increased Hb levels in subjects with anaemia associated with CKDand also in other populations such as patients with peripheral arterial disease. These molecules may be of value in chronic lung disease where a dysregulated EPO response may revert to a more functional response in the setting of improved longer term iron regulation through HIF stabilisation. Through this mechanism and improved tissue O 2 delivery, chronic EPO levels may be lower and more stable in addition to more functional. Investigation of agents targeting HIF-PHIs (prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors) for the treatment of anaemia associated with CKD have progressed into Phase III clinical studies, including large cardiovascular outcome trials. For the treatment of anaemia of CKD, HIF stabilisation has the potential to provide similar or better efficacy to approved therapies with the potential for an improved safety profile, most notably compared with rhEPO and conventional ESAs. Adverse effects that were initially observed with ESAs included elevated blood pressure, seizures and a high rate of thrombotic events, although approaches to slowly increase the haematocrit seem to minimise these problems, concerns around the development of immune reactions to developing antibodies and cardiovascular events remain. The risks associated with rhEPO may hypothetically be found with HIF-PHIs since they also raise Hb and EPO levels, although the mechanism of action of increasing red blood cell mass is not solely mediated through EPO, and EPO is not raised to the supraphysiological levels observed following administration of exogenous rhEPO injection. Hypothetical risks for malignancy and pulmonary hypertension have been suggested by findings in patients with naturally occurring mutations that result in HIF upregulation and these may be particularly relevant in chronic lung disease where patients are already predisposed to these afflictions. Furthermore, beyond the relevance of iron in innate immunity, animal and cell studies indicate a potential for HIF upregulation to increase the risk of infection. Despite these considerations, HIF-PHIs have been considered safe and well tolerated in clinical studies thus far and outcome studies currently underway will add further to the longer term safety experience with manipulating HIF as a therapeutic strategy. Given pulmonary hypertension may deteriorate under strain in chronic lung disease, this requires further consideration. The key driver for the development of pulmonary hypertension in chronic lung disease is hypoxia, subsequently improved O 2 delivery (through improved Hb) and improved iron availability mediated by HIF stabilisation could potentially ameliorate pulmonary hypertension. Anaemia in the setting of pulmonary hypertension and COPD is associated with a greater rate of deterioration in exercise capacity, hypoxaemia, quality of life and acute exacerbations. Recent clinical experience indicates that HIF-PHI can increase EPO levels at very small doses where drug exposure may be largely or even entirely confined to the liver and kidneys (EPO-producing organs). Therefore, it is possible the EPO-producing potential of these agents can be realised without direct effects on the lung vasculature.

Figure 4
The clinical and biological factors relevant to iron dysregulation and anaemia of chronic disease in respiratory populations. EPO, erythropoietin.

Other factors besides inflammation have been described as being relevant in the development of anaemia in chronic lung disease including: (1) renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system dysregulation resulting in reduced erythropoiesis,(2) renal impairment resulting in reduced EPO production and reduced hepcidin clearance,(3) theophylline treatment resulting in reduced EPO production and/or direct inhibition of erythroid progenitor cells,(4) androgen deficiency resulting in reduced erythropoiesisand (5) malnutrition resulting in iron, vitamin B 12 and folic acid deficiencies. Other factors relevant to general populations such as impaired bone marrow response may also be relevant, especially in COPD and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) which typically occur in older populations.

EPO acts as the primary stimulus for erythropoiesis and is normally produced by the kidneys in response to reduced tissue oxygenation. Renal impairment, which is common in patients with COPD, can lead to disruption in EPO production. However, in COPD, the relationship between hypoxia, inflammation, iron and EPO is complex with studies showing differing results. Non-clinical and clinical evidence suggests that EPO production could be inhibited by the effects of inflammatory cytokines; however, some clinical studies have also identified mildly increased levels of EPO (circa twofold) in COPD. While upregulation of EPO is expected in the setting of hypoxia, these increased EPO levels in COPD are not necessarily translated to enhanced erythropoiesis. While some have considered this as EPO resistance, in the setting of multiple factors relevant to anaemia in this population, especially inflammation, this may be alternatively considered a relative EPO deficiency (figure 4); the levels observed are certainly well below those seen when a functional response occurs — in the setting of erythropoiesis therapeutically driven by exogenous EPO, EPO levels may be 100s of fold greater. Consistent with an inadequate EPO response in chronic lung disease, exacerbations which are inherently associated with inflammation and hypoxia, are associated with an increased prevalence of anaemiaand EPO levels have been demonstrated to fall in this setting.

### Effect of hypoxia on the hematopoietic and immune modulator preprotachykinin-I… [^117FbABt]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

Results Hypoxia resulted in a 110% increase in the number of CFU-GMs and a 78% increase in the number of BFU-E colonies at 6 hours. Elimination of the stromal elements by purification abrogated the increase in colony formation to nonhypoxic levels. These results indicate that hypoxia has a role in the proliferation and control of CFU-GMs and BFU-Es. This control seems to be mediated through the bone marrow stroma and modulated by NK receptors and induction of PPT-I. The neuropeptide, substance P, probably has a role but is clearly not the only mediator involved. These enhancing effects did not require exogenous growth factors, suggesting that substance P could be inducing relevant hematopoietic cytokines.

Indeed, subsequent studies indicated that incubation with substance P resulted in the production of direct- and indirect-acting hematopoietic cytokines, IL-1, IL-3, IL-6, GM-CSF, and c-kit ligand.
15. An increase in fibroblast cell–like proliferation also was noted at 2 and 6 hours of hypoxia compared with the normoxia control. These results indicate that hypoxia significantly increases the growth of CFU-GMs and BFU-Es compared with normoxic BMMCs, and hypoxia seems to be a myelopoietic stimulus. Since this separation technique results in a minimum loss of CD34+ cells, 19 the results indicate that the bone marrow stroma is necessary for and has a role in the increase in the growth of CFU-GMs and BFU-Es that is caused by hypoxia. Compared with unstimulated normoxic stroma, the steady state PPT-I mRNA levels were increased at 24 hours in stroma subjected to hypoxia alone and normoxic stroma stimulated with IL-1α.

In 3 separate experiments, we observed 61 ± 14 and 51 ± 11 colonies per plate for BFU-E and CFU-GM, respectively. After exposure to hypoxia, these levels were increased by 67% for BFU-Es and 60% for CFU-GMs.

### Oxygen sensing in the kidney [^11312JPz]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

The kidneys fulfil several essential homeostatic functions for the body. One of them is the maintenance of sufficient oxygen supply to the organs. For this purpose, the kidneys control the formation of red blood cells by the production of the hormone erythropoietin. This control of red cell formation is not only relevant to prevent states of oxygen deficiency but also to prevent an unwanted increase of red cell numbers causing thromboembolic risks. The adequate production of erythropoietin requires a sensing of the arterial oxygen content and transduction to hormone production. This oxygen sensing is a two-step process which includes a translation of the arterial oxygen content to respective oxygen tension in the tubulointerstitium and a perception of the resulting local interstitial oxygen tension to translate them into specific cellular responses such as the production of erythropoietin. This contribution will describe these steps of oxygen sensing for the healthy kidney and for the changes occurring during states of chronic renal disease, which are commonly associated with anemia. In this context a special focus will also be set on intrarenal hypoxia and oxygen sensing in the diabetic kidney including the treatment with tubular glucose transport (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2) inhibitors which might influence the oxygen sensing in the kidney. Finally, we will consider the effects of prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHIs), which fundamentally interfere with the cellular oxygen sensing and which are meanwhile treatment options in renal anemia.

### Anaemia and iron dysregulation: untapped therapeutic targets in chronic lung disease? [^113CNDwc]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

It has been shown in COPD that Hb is directly related to oxygen consumption (VO 2 max) even after accounting for disease severityand, at a patient level, symptomatic burden and mortality. Indeed O 2 availability impacts ventilation, pulmonary blood flow and gene expression throughout the body. Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) is an established therapy that reduces both morbidityand mortalityin severely hypoxic patients and, in appropriate populations, supplementing inspired O 2 increases exercise duration. Scenarios where other factors may be more important than traditional measures of oxygenation and consistent with the relevance of Hb concentration to circulating O 2 content (figure 3) include patients with less severe exercise O 2 desaturation not benefitting from supplementing inspired oxygenand conflicting data surrounding the impact of O 2 supplementation on exercise performance and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).

Despite the benefits of O 2 supplementation, even when the recipient is carefully selected, there remain the practical issues in ensuring that inspired O 2 is supplemented for the required time (> 15 hours a day) to achieve benefit. Furthermore, in some subsets such as ongoing smokers, the risks may actually outweigh the benefits. Given the challenges of normalising O 2 delivery in patients with established lung disease, other strategies that improve O 2 content and metabolism might deliver direct patient benefits and synergise with the benefits of other available therapeutic strategies including oxygen supplementation itself. Thus, increasing Hb availability represents a novel therapeutic opportunity in this populationwith the potential to improve exercise tolerance, dyspnoea, fatigue and HRQoL, and in the longer term, reduce the risk of hospitalisation and mortality (figure 2). Beyond any relevance to erythropoiesis, there is also a potential role for treating dysregulated iron metabolism in chronic lung disease, given a shared pathophysiology, hereon, we detail the aetiology and relevance of anaemia and functional iron deficiency in respiratory disease.

### Mechanisms of enhanced renal and hepatic erythropoietin synthesis by sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors [^113FLK2D]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Why do sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors stimulate the production of erythropoietin?

Four hypotheses have been proposed to explain how these drugs might increase erythropoietin production: (i) renal cortical reoxygenation with rejuvenation of interstitial cells; (ii) counterregulatory distal sodium reabsorption leading to increased tubular workload and renal deep cortical and medullary hypoxia; (iii) increased iron mobilization as an inducer of HIF-2α-mediated erythropoietin synthesis; and (iv) HIF-2α activation and increased erythropoietin gene transcription due to increased nutrient deprivation signaling. This article reviews the merits and limitations of these four hypotheses (Table 1).

### Induction of erythroferrone in healthy humans by micro-dose recombinant erythropoietin or high-altitude exposure [^117GuM4T]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 3.
Relationships between erythroferrone and erythropoietin with recombinant human erythropoietin and high altitude. (A, B) Relationship between individual serum concentrations (ln transformed) of erythroferrone (ERFE) and erythropoietin (Epo), before, during and after six injections of placebo, micro-dose or low-dose recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEpo) in healthy subjects (A), and at sea level and after 15 h of exposure to high altitude (3800 m) in healthy subjects (B). Regression equations, coefficients of determination and P values are reported in each panel. Relationships between hepcidin, Epo and ERFE during rhEpo injections are available in Online Supplementary Figure S2.

We also found concomitant increases in Epo and ERFE in healthy subjects exposed to a high altitude condition associated with O2 saturation of 85 ± 3% (Figure 4A, B). The correlation between ERFE and serum Epo found at high altitude (Fig 3B) and with rhEpo treatment (Figure 3A) suggests that hypoxia-related signaling is not directly involved in ERFE induction, as previously shown in mice.ERFE tended to increase more with micro-dose rhEpo than with exposure to high altitude (P = 0.22), whereas Epo increased less with the micro-dose injections than with exposure to high altitude (P = 0.04) (data not shown). We speculate that the shorter time of exposure to elevated Epo levels at high altitude (15 h) versus micro-dose injections (24 h) may account for the observed trend. Tfsat, which was close to the level defining iron deficiency (< 20%), did not change (Figure 4C). Consistent with the low Tfsat, hepcidin concentration at sea level was below the detection limit in 15 subjects and was unchanged after exposure to high altitude in the subjects with detectable baseline values (Figure 4D). Lack of correlation between ERFE and hepcidin was previously found in patients with chronic kidney disease, in whom increased ERFE levels were not accompanied by lower hepcidin. In line with a previous report showing unaltered iron availability and no signs of inflammation at high altitude, the inflammatory marker interleukin-6 was not affected by the subjects' exposure to high altitude (1.28 ± 1.04 pg/mL vs. 1.25 ± 0.9 pg/mL at sea level), whereas the concentration of ferritin increased slightly (from 125 ± 8 to 132 ± 7 ng/mL), although remaining within the normal range (Figure 4E).

### Renal function, erythropoietin, and anemia of older persons… [^113wD4S5]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Consistently, participants with a CrCl of 30 mL/min or lower had significantly lower age- and hemoglobin-adjusted erythropoietin endogenous levels. After excluding men and women with CrCl of 30 mL/min or lower and adjusting for confounders, we found a trend toward an increase in prevalence of anemia with decreasing renal function; however, it was not statistically significant. It has been suggested that the ability of the kidney to secrete erythropoietin in response to tissue hypoxia declines with aging11 in parallel with the decline of renal function. At present, controversial data are available on the EPO response to anemia in the older population compared with the younger population, 12, 13 and scant data are available on the relationship between renal function and risk of anemia in samples of community-dwelling older persons representative of the general population.

When the presence of a trend toward an increase in the prevalence of anemia with reduction of renal function among subjects with CrCl higher than 30 mL/min was tested, we found a significant trend only in the unadjusted, but not in the age- and sex-adjusted, analysis. To further assess the effect of declining kidney function on anemia, sex-specific linear models were fitted predicting the log EPO level according to CrCl, after adjusting for age and Hb level, in the 131 participants with anemia. Participants with CrCl of 30 mL/min or lower had significantly lower age- and Hb-adjusted EPO levels compared with the group with CrCl higher than 90 mL/min. Moreover, in the adjusted analysis, no significant trend toward an increase in the prevalence of anemia with reduction of renal function among subjects with mild to moderate CrCl was found.

Accordingly, only the group of persons with CrCl of 30 mL/min had significantly lower age- and Hb-adjusted EPO plasma levels compared with normal participants. Our findings suggest that in older persons the age-related reduction in the ability of the kidney to secrete EPO is an important risk factor for anemia only when the GFR is severely reduced.

### The role of hypoxia in chronic kidney disease: a nuanced perspective [^112eN5uT]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

In addition to the effects mediated by the HIF pathway, hypoxia can also exert cellular responses through mechanisms independent of HIF. For instance, hypoxia-induced oxidative stress can activate various signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathways, leading to altered gene expression and cellular responses. Moreover, hypoxia-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production can directly damage cellular components such as proteins, lipids, and DNA, triggering oxidative stress-mediated pathways such as apoptosis or autophagy. Additionally, hypoxia can modulate cellular metabolism independently of HIF, such as by activating the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway or altering mitochondrial function, leading to metabolic reprogramming to support cell survival under low oxygen conditions.

HIF-α has two isoforms, HIF-1α and HIF-2α, which exhibit differential tissue expression patterns and regulate distinct sets of target genes. While HIF-1β is universally expressed, HIF-1α is present in all organs, whereas HIF-2α is primarily found in the lungs, heart, and endothelial cells. In the kidneys, HIF-1α is localized within renal tubules, whereas HIF-2α is expressed in endothelial and renal interstitial fibroblast-like (REP) cells. HIF-1α primarily regulates genes involved in glycolytic metabolism, whereas HIF-2α governs the expression of erythropoietin (EPO) and genes crucial for angiogenesis and iron metabolism. Additionally, the role of HIF-3α, though less understood, is speculated to function as a negative regulator of HIF-1α and 2α.

The oxygen-dependent regulation of the HIF pathway involves the enzymatic activity of prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain (PHD1–3) enzymes and the asparagine hydroxylase factor inhibiting HIF (FIH). PHDs catalyze the hydroxylation of HIF-α isoforms, leading to their degradation via ubiquitination mediated by the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) protein, whereas FIH-mediated asparagine hydroxylation prevents HIF heterodimer interaction with CBP/p300, thereby reducing HIF transactivation activity for specific target genes.

Regarding medical management for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (initiation), UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors in patients with hyporesponsiveness to ESA therapy or underlying inflammation, but further high-quality randomized trials are needed to confirm its effectiveness.

### Erythropoietin and renoprotection [^1144bh48]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

In the haematopoietic system, the principal function of erythropoietin (EPO) is the regulation of RBC production. Consequently, following the cloning of the EPO gene, recombinant human EPO (rHuEPO) forms have been widely used for treatment of anaemia in chronic kidney disease and chemotherapy-induced anaemia in cancer patients. However, a steadily growing body of evidence indicates that the therapeutic benefits of rHuEPO could be far beyond the correction of anaemia. Several articles have been recently published on the tissue-protective, nonhaematological effects of rHuEPO that prevent ischaemia-induced tissue damage in several organs including the kidney. In this review, we focus on nonhaematological effects of rHuEPO in various experimental settings of acute and chronic kidney injury. Because this tissue-protective action of rHuEPO is not the result of correction of anaemia-related tissue hypoxia, we will also discuss potential molecular pathways involved. Finally, we will review the current literature on clinical studies with rHuEPO or analogous substances and progression of chronic kidney disease, and propose possible clinical renoprotective strategies.

### Mechanisms and mediators of hypertension induced by erythropoietin and related molecules [^111v3yJM]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a common but frequently overlooked adverse effect of erythropoietin (EPO) therapy. Underreporting of hypertension with EPO is likely due to either more aggressively managing hypertension through the prescription of antihypertensive drugs or closer attention to dry weight. The purpose and focus of this review is to critically evaluate the mechanisms of EPO-induced hypertension. Preclinical data are considered first, followed by clinical data where available. Mediated by a variety of molecules, there is an imbalance in the vascular tone favoring net vasoconstriction that mediates EPO-induced hypertension. Animal studies show the primary importance of chronic kidney disease in the genesis of EPO-induced hypertension. Preclinical studies show deranged regulation of the nitric oxide, endothelins and porstanoids and the sympathoadrenal and renin-angiotensin pathways as causes of EPO-induced hypertension. Human studies suggest that EPO administration is also associated with increased responsiveness to catecholamines and angiotensin II on vascular tissue; in addition, hypoxia-induced vasodilation may be impaired in those with EPO-induced hypertension. There is little evidence for EPO as a direct vasoconstrictor or its effect on blood viscosity as a mechanism of EPO-induced hypertension. EPO-induced hypertension, at least in part, appears to be independent of an increase in hemoglobin, because experiments show that hemoglobin may be increased by EPO without an increase in blood pressure (BP) by simply treating the animals with EPO-binding protein and that treatment with EPO in the setting of iron deficiency may not increase hemoglobin but may still increase BP. However, experimental data are not consistent across studies and better mechanistic designs are needed, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease, to dissect the precise mechanism of EPO-induced hypertension. Animal studies suggest that hypoxia-inducible factor stablizers may induce hypertension by provoking calcification and augmenting chronic intermittent hypoxia as occurs in sleep apnea. Others show that there may be an antihypertensive effect via kidney repair. Whether these drugs will alter the risk of hypertension compared with EPO remains to be seen.

### Hypoxia-inducible factors link iron homeostasis and erythropoiesis [^116tosbW]. Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Iron is required for efficient oxygen transport, and hypoxia signaling links erythropoiesis with iron homeostasis. Hypoxia induces a highly conserved signaling pathway in cells under conditions of low levels of O2. One component of this pathway, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), is a transcription factor that is highly active in hypoxic cells. The first HIF target gene characterized was EPO, which encodes erythropoietin-a glycoprotein hormone that controls erythropoiesis. In the past decade, there have been fundamental advances in our understanding of how hypoxia regulates iron levels to support erythropoiesis and maintain systemic iron homeostasis. We review the cell type-specific effects of hypoxia and HIFs in adaptive response to changes in oxygen and iron availability as well as potential uses of HIF modulators for patients with iron-related disorders.

### Red cell macrocytosis in hypoxemic patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113p8oz4]. Respiratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Macrocytosis is a common finding in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The cause for the elevation of mean corpuscular volume (MCV) in these patients remains elusive. In an attempt to determine the extent of macrocytosis in COPD patients and search for possible causative factors, we evaluated the hematologic parameters, F-cell percentage, blood gases and serum erythropoietin (Epo) Levels in 32 COPD clinically stable patients and 34 sex- and age-matched non-smoker healthy volunteers. An increased MCV was observed in almost half of the hypoxemic COPD cases (14/32 or 43.75%), while erythrocytosis developed to a lesser degree (37.5%). The erythropoietic response did not correlate with the severity of hypoxia. Moreover, no significant correlation was found between macrocytosis and hypoxemia or erythrocytosis and red cell size. In some cases the two phenomena occurred independently. The F-cell percentage was significantly elevated in the COPD group (P < 0.01) and was associated with MCV values (n = 32, r5 = 0.41, P < 0.05). This finding supports the hypothesis we put forward to explain the macrocytosis often observed in COPD, i.e., that the acute erythropoietic stress occurring repeatedly in these patients as a result of the frequent exacerbations may lead to waves of release of relatively immature, large red cells from the marrow, including an increased number of F-cells, reflecting the recruitment of normally dormant BFU-E (bursts forming units of erythrocyte precursors), which maintain the program for gamma-chain synthesis. The fact that erythrocytosis and macrocytosis, both being triggered by hypoxemia, do not occur consistently in all COPD patients indicates that many other factors may also intervene.

### Association of polymorphisms in the erythropoietin gene with diabetic retinopathy: a case-control study and systematic review with meta-analysis [^1158Fser]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a chronic complication of diabetes mellitus and the leading cause of blindness in working-age adults. Clinically, it is classified as non-proliferative (NPDR) and proliferative (PDR). Non-proliferative DR is characterized by microaneurysms, exudates, venous beading, and intraretinal microvascular abnormalities, whereas PDR is characterized by neovascularization, which can result in intraocular bleeding, vision loss, and retinal detachment. Chronic hyperglycemia augments the activation of biochemical pathways that promote the production of inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species, and vasoactive substances. Collectively, these changes disrupt the neurovascular structures and alter normal retinal function by leading to the blood–retinal barrier breakdown, pericyte loss, neuronal death, and angiogenesis.

Erythropoietin (EPO) is a pleiotropic hormone produced mainly by the adult kidney in response to hypoxia or anemia to increase the production of red blood cells. Erythropoietin and its receptors are also expressed in several other tissues in response to tissue injury, including the retinal pigment epithelium, outer and inner nuclear layers, and ganglion cell layer of the retina, where they exert cytoprotective effects. Experimental studies have shown that EPO has antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and angiogenic properties, thereby protecting against retinal damage by reducing the pericyte loss, formation of acellular capillaries, and degeneration of neuroretinal layers, amongst several other features of early DR. Despite the beneficial effects of EPO administration reported in small human clinical trials and several experimental models of ocular diseases, patients with PDR have high levels of EPO in the vitreous fluid, aqueous humor, postmortem retinal tissue, plasma, and serum.

### Erythrocyte indices and response to hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors in chronic kidney disease patients with renal anemia: a retrospective study [^111L4RGq]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Renal anemia is one of the most frequent complications in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, affecting 40 to 60% of patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 30 ml/min. Anemia in CKD patients is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and the progression of kidney disease. Moreover, renal anemia can decrease exercise capacity in CKD patients, resulting in a reduced quality of life. Therefore, the appropriate management of renal anemia is a key aspect of health care for CKD patients.

The administration of recombinant human erythropoietin and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) has long been the standard treatment for renal anemia, profoundly improving the control of hemoglobin (Hb) levels in CKD patients. Nonetheless, concerns remain regarding the use of ESAs, such as ESA hyporesponsiveness and the risk of cardiovascular damage at high doses. Hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHIs) are a new class of agents administered orally and indicated for the treatment of renal anemia. By inhibiting HIF-PH, which targets HIFs for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, these agents increase HIF abundance and stimulate erythropoiesis in the body. Besides promoting endogenous erythropoietin production, HIF-PHIs are considered to act through multiple mechanisms, including stimulating erythroid differentiation, increasing circulating iron levels by modulating molecules such as ferroportin and hepcidin, and promoting iron uptake in erythrocytes by upregulating the transferrin receptor TfR1. However, there are currently no clear criteria for determining how to differentiate between the use of ESAs and HIF-PHIs.

Functional hypoxia as part of a novel model of neuroplasticity

Hypoxia is the term for reduced oxygen in cells/tissues, relative to 'normal' Earlier interpreted as principally pathological, e.g. upon cardiac arrest, hypoxia is increasingly recognized as strong driver of development including angiogenesis, hematopoiesis, or regeneration. In perfect support, quite some literature deals with hypoxic/ischemic preconditioning, where sub-lethal insults induce protection against later fatal injuries by improving tolerance, e.g. through lasting or stand-by activation of hypoxia signaling pathways, anti-apoptosis, anti-excitotoxicity, and autophagy. Noteworthy, hypoxia can be the ultimate consequence of various processes, including lower oxygen availability due to hypoxemia, anemia, perfusion impairment, or increased oxygen consumption ('functional hypoxia'). Although the mere cellular responses to physiological and pathological hypoxia are similar, they are accompanied by different parallel mechanisms, potentially directing responses towards beneficial effects as observed upon mild to moderate inspiratory hypoxia or functional hypoxia (as discussed in this review) or adverse effects, e.g. occurring upon ischemia or dysregulation of cerebral perfusion.

### The effect of HIF on metabolism and immunity [^1126kZji]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2022). High credibility.

Cellular hypoxia occurs when the demand for sufficient molecular oxygen needed to produce the levels of ATP required to perform physiological functions exceeds the vascular supply, thereby leading to a state of oxygen depletion with the associated risk of bioenergetic crisis. To protect against the threat of hypoxia, eukaryotic cells have evolved the capacity to elicit oxygen-sensitive adaptive transcriptional responses driven primarily (although not exclusively) by the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway. In addition to the canonical regulation of HIF by oxygen-dependent hydroxylases, multiple other input signals, including gasotransmitters, non-coding RNAs, histone modifiers and post-translational modifications, modulate the nature of the HIF response in discreet cell types and contexts. Activation of HIF induces various effector pathways that mitigate the effects of hypoxia, including metabolic reprogramming and the production of erythropoietin. Drugs that target the HIF pathway to induce erythropoietin production are now approved for the treatment of chronic kidney disease-related anaemia. However, HIF-dependent changes in cell metabolism also have profound implications for functional responses in innate and adaptive immune cells, and thereby heavily influence immunity and the inflammatory response. Preclinical studies indicate a potential use of HIF therapeutics to treat inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease. Understanding the links between HIF, cellular metabolism and immunity is key to unlocking the full therapeutic potential of drugs that target the HIF pathway.

### New agents that stimulate erythropoiesis [^112bPTdB]. Blood (2007). Low credibility.

Recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEpo) has proven to be remarkably safe and effective for treatment of anemias, primarily those secondary to renal disease and malignancy. Despite the worldwide use of rhEpo, concerns about its cost, the need for frequent parenteral administration, and the development of anti-Epo antibodies have prompted development of improved agents to stimulate erythropoiesis. Three strategies appear to be particularly promising. The half-life of Epo in the circulation can be prolonged by the addition of N-linked carbohydrate groups, by formation of adducts with polyethylene glycol, and by preparation of Epo multimers. Second, mimetic peptides can effectively trigger signal transduction at the Epo receptor, thereby boosting red-cell production. Finally, the hypoxia inducible transcription factor (HIF) can be pharmacologically induced by oral agents, resulting in enhanced expression not only of endogenous Epo but also of other genes important in the regulation of erythropoiesis.

### Breakthrough science: hypoxia-inducible factors, oxygen sensing, and disorders of hematopoiesis [^116CkDzC]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) were discovered as activators of erythropoietin gene transcription in response to reduced oxygen (O2) availability. O2-dependent hydroxylation of HIFs on proline and asparagine residues regulates protein stability and transcriptional activity, respectively. Mutations in genes encoding components of the O2-sensing pathway cause familial erythrocytosis. Several small-molecule inhibitors of HIF prolyl hydroxylases are currently in clinical trials as erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. HIFs are overexpressed in bone marrow neoplasms, and the development of HIF inhibitors may improve outcomes in these disorders.

### Somatic inactivation of the PHD2 prolyl hydroxylase causes polycythemia and congestive heart failure [^115widBw]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

Pharmacologic activation of the heterodimeric HIF transcription factor appears promising as a strategy to treat diseases, such as anemia, myocardial infarction, and stroke, in which tissue hypoxia is a prominent feature. HIF accumulation is normally linked to oxygen availability because an oxygen-dependent posttranslational modification (prolyl hydroxylation) marks the HIFalpha subunit for polyubiquitination and destruction. Three enzymes (PHD1, PHD2, and PHD3) capable of catalyzing this reaction have been identified, although PHD2 (also called Egln1) appears to be the primary HIF prolyl hydroxylase in cell culture experiments. We found that conditional inactivation of PHD2 in mice is sufficient to activate a subset of HIF target genes, including erythropoietin, leading to striking increases in red blood cell production. Mice lacking PHD2 exhibit premature mortality associated with marked venous congestion and dilated cardiomyopathy. The latter is likely the result of hyperviscosity syndrome and volume overload, although a direct effect of chronic, high-level HIF stimulation on cardiac myocytes cannot be excluded.

### Mechanisms of enhanced renal and hepatic erythropoietin synthesis by sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors [^116F5UdK]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

These observations, taken collectively, indicate that SGLT2 inhibitors — acting through several mechanisms mediated through SIRT1 — might be able to directly activate HIF-2α and HNF4 and promote erythropoietin gene transcription, independent of hypoxia or the action of prolyl hydroxylases (Graphical Abstract). Additional studies are needed to confirm or refute this hypothesis. Although SGLT2 inhibitors have been reported to up-regulate HIF-2α in the heart; their effect on the activity of HIF-2α and HNF4 in the liver and kidney has not yet been studied.

Summary and conclusions

Understanding the mechanisms of enhanced erythropoietin production may provide important insights into the pathways that mediate the cardioprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors. The available evidence does not support the hypothesis that drug-mediated changes in renal tubular workload and oxygen consumption are likely to trigger hypoxia-mediated increases in erythropoietin production by interstitial fibroblast-like 1 cells in the deep cortex and outer medulla of the kidney. Instead, it seems likely that the action of SGLT2 inhibitors to up-regulate signaling through SIRT1 may directly or indirectly up-regulate HIF-2α and/or HNF4 to promote transcription of the erythropoietin gene, particularly in the liver. Hepatic synthesis may be particularly important during long-term therapy and in patients with chronic kidney disease and anemia in whom interstitial fibroblast-like 1 cells are severely compromised, but who nevertheless show an unattenuated erythrocytic response to SGLT2 inhibitors. Since SIRT1 up-regulation exerts direct cardioprotective effects and stimulates erythropoietin, it may represent the shared mechanism that links erythropoiesis to the heart failure benefits of SGLT2 inhibition.

### The human side of hypoxia-inducible factor [^115W3aME]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

The human response to hypoxia is characterised by systemic changes in haematopoietic, respiratory, and cardiovascular physiology that combine to restore adequate oxygenation. Uptake and transport of oxygen are initially maximised through an increase in ventilation and cardiac output, while oxygen carriage is subsequently optimised through acceleration of erythropoiesis. The homeostatic drive underlying these systemic effects is similarly evident at the cellular level, where hypoxia is met by a coordinated transcriptional response that seeks to minimise hypoxic injury and redress the oxygen debt. This cellular response is controlled by the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) family of transcription factors, a DNA binding complex that was first defined as a regulator of erythropoietin (Epo) gene (EPO) expression but which is now known to be conserved in all animal species, irrespective of the presence of specialised oxygen transfer systems such as the lungs, heart, and blood. Studies at the cellular level indicate that HIF directly or indirectly regulates several hundred genes that serve a great variety of functional pathways including angiogenesis, cell growth, apoptosis, energy metabolism and vasomotor regulation. Recent studies in humans have also demonstrated a major role in systemic responses to hypoxia that extends to each of the principal organ systems upon which cellular oxygen delivery ultimately depends. This article reviews our current understanding of the importance of HIF in human systems-level physiology, and is modelled around the classic physiological response to high-altitude hypoxia. Readers are referred to other reviews for detailed analyses of the interaction between HIF and cancer biology, angiogenesis and therapeutics.

### Roxadustat does not affect platelet production, activation, and thrombosis formation [^112B1bDU]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2021). Medium credibility.

Highlights

HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor)-1α and HIF-2α are expressed in platelets and accumulate in the presence of proline hydroxylase inhibitors.
Conventional therapeutic dose of roxadustat increases intracellular HIFs and upregulates EPO (erythropoietin) expression lightly and transiently in vivo.
We revealed for the first time that roxadustat does not affect platelet functions both in vitro and in vivo.
Roxadustat has no effect on platelet production.

Renal anemia is one of the most common complications of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is characterized by decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, and circulating erythrocytes. This type of anemia occurs due to lack of EPO (erythropoietin) synthesis by the kidneys. Therefore, exogenous EPO has become an important treatment for renal anemia. Although EPO is effective in correcting anemia, there are some concerns that need to be considered. EPO has already been reported to enhance platelet activation and production, which may increase the risk of thrombosis in CKD patients. Previous studies have revealed that platelet activity is significantly increased in patients with CKD. This hyperactivity is caused by uremic toxins and inflammatory reactions that have activating effects on platelets, placing CKD patients at a higher risk of thrombosis than people with normal kidney function. Thus, for these patients, EPO therapy with its effect on platelet activation might not be a good choice.

HIFs (hypoxia-inducible factors) — key transcription factors for cell adaptation to hypoxia — have been reported to participate in glucose metabolism, cell proliferation/survival, angiogenesis, and iron metabolism.HIFs also upregulate the expression of EPO by binding to a consensus sequence (5′-TACGTGCT-3′) in the EPO 3′ enhancer region. In normoxia, the HIF-α subunit is hydroxylated by PHD (prolyl hydroxylase domain), ubiquitinated, and then finally degraded by the proteasome. When oxygen levels decrease, hypoxia impairs the activity of PHD, thus reducing HIF degradation. Roxadustat stabilizes HIF by inhibiting PHD; HIF thus accumulates intracellularly by avoiding recognition by ubiquitinating enzymes. This upregulates the expression of several HIF-responsive genes including EPO, the EPO receptor, and proteins promoting iron absorption, iron transport, and heme synthesis, which makes roxadustat treatment of renal anemia possible.

### Mechanistic and clinical comparison of the erythropoietic effects of SGLT2 inhibitors and prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors in patients with chronic kidney disease and renal anemia [^116FQP1K]. American Journal of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Renal anemia is treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), even though epoetin alfa and darbepoetin increase the risk of cardiovascular death and thromboembolic events, including stroke. Hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase domain (HIF-PHD) inhibitors have been developed as an alternative to ESAs, producing comparable increases in hemoglobin. However, in advanced chronic kidney disease, HIF-PHD inhibitors can increase the risk of cardiovascular death, heart failure, and thrombotic events to a greater extent than that with ESAs, indicating that there is a compelling need for safer alternatives. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events, and they increase hemoglobin, an effect that is related to an increase in erythropoietin and an expansion in red blood cell mass. SGLT2 inhibitors increase hemoglobin by ≈0.6–0.7 g/dL, resulting in the alleviation of anemia in many patients. The magnitude of this effect is comparable to that seen with low-to-medium doses of HIF-PHD inhibitors, and it is apparent even in advanced chronic kidney disease. Interestingly, HIF-PHD inhibitors act by interfering with the prolyl hydroxylases that degrade both HIF-1α and HIF-2α, thus enhancing both isoforms. However, HIF-2α is the physiological stimulus to the production of erythropoietin, and upregulation of HIF-1α may be an unnecessary ancillary property of HIF-PHD inhibitors, which may have adverse cardiac and vascular consequences. In contrast, SGLT2 inhibitors act to selectively increase HIF-2α, while downregulating HIF-1α, a distinctive profile that may contribute to their cardiorenal benefits. Intriguingly, for both HIF-PHD and SGLT2 inhibitors, the liver is likely to be an important site of increased erythropoietin production, recapitulating the fetal phenotype. These observations suggest that the use of SGLT2 inhibitors should be seriously evaluated as a therapeutic approach to treat renal anemia, yielding less cardiovascular risk than other therapeutic options.

### Arterial oxygen content regulates plasma erythropoietin independent of arterial oxygen tension: a blinded crossover study [^115C2FY6]. Kidney International (2019). Medium credibility.

The production of erythropoietin (Epo) is modulated by renal tissue oxygen tension, which in principle depends on both arterial oxygen content (CaO2) and arterial oxygen tension (PaO2). Uncontrolled observational studies suggest that alterations in CaO2 fundamentally regulate Epo synthesis. We sought to establish whether reduced CaO2 enhances plasma Epo concentration independently of PaO 2. In a blinded crossover study, 8 healthy young subjects were exposed to three conditions: room air (normoxia); 11% oxygen balanced in nitrogen, which lowers both CaO2 and PaO2 (hypoxia); and carbon monoxide plus normoxia, which decreases CaO2 to the same degree as hypoxia while preserving PaO2 (hypoxemia). Arterial blood samples were obtained prior to and throughout the 5 hours of exposure to each condition. In the hypoxic conditions, average CaO2 was reduced to similar levels, whereas PaO2 was only decreased with exposure to hypoxia. Plasma Epo concentration was increased in both hypoxic conditions relative to normoxia after 150 min of exposure and was augmented more than two-fold after 300 min, with no difference between hypoxic conditions. Reduced CaO2 induces similar increases in circulating Epo concentration irrespective of PaO2 manipulation, demonstrating that CaO2 is the critical variable regulating Epo production.

### Erythropoietin regulates energy metabolism through EPO-epoR-RUNX1 axis [^115hH6pz]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Limitations of the current study include the use of Tg6-mice with high chronic expression of transgenic human EPO in brain, lung and other tissues and the abnormally high chronic hematocrit that increases from 52% at 2 weeks to > 80% by 5 weeks of age. Tg6-mice have enhanced endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity to regulate the resultant elevated blood viscositythat may provide an indirect EPO activity to improve metabolism as mice with overexpression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase exhibit resistance to diet-induced obesity and adipose tissue with increased metabolic activity and altered lipid metabolism. To validate results linked to high EPO for lipid metabolism gene expression, both Tg6-mice and WT-mice treated with EPO were used. Adipose tissue expression of EpoR and adipose tissue response to EPO are important determinants of EPO metabolic regulation, and we focused on EPO stimulated regulation of fat mass, especially lipid metabolism in WAT. How EPO stimulation affects WAT transcriptome and proteome including other RUNX1 target genes, secreted adipokines and metabolites that may also affect metabolic response in other tissues have yet to be identified. While we considered EPO metabolic activity and EpoR expression in WAT, BAT, skeletal muscle and liver, the relationship between the EPO–EpoR axis and E3 ubiquitin ligase signaling and the tissue-specific mechanism of FBXW7 and RUNX1 in regulation of lipid metabolism in BAT, skeletal muscle and liver are unknown. We did not include other EpoR expressing tissues such as brain and central nervous system, immune cells/macrophages, cardiovascular system/heart/endothelium, and gastrointestinal tractthat are likely to contribute to EPO metabolic response. EPO treatment improves glucose metabolism in male and female mice and the current study was restricted to male mice because of the overlapping protective effect of estrogen against diet-induced obesity in female mice. How these animal studies related to EPO stimulation in human to regulation of fat mass and lipid metabolism and the potential sex-dimorphic response, warrants further study. Clinical treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease with oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors that stimulate endogenous EPO production to increase hemoglobin may be as effective as erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, and the metabolic responses to this new class of drugs remain to be determined. EPO mimetic peptides were designed to stimulate non-erythroid EPO-like activity without increasing hematocrit such as ARA290 that has been suggested to benefit human metabolic control and neuropathy –, raising the potential for EPO mimetics to treat obesity and metabolic syndromes. Despite these limitations, our study provides new insights into how the EPO–EpoR axis regulates lipid metabolism and improves obesity. Our results suggest that the EPO–EpoR axis in non-hematopoietic tissue effects may simultaneously alleviate obesity associated metabolic derangements.

MECHANISM OF ACTION OF HIF-PHI

The HIF pathway is an exquisite oxygen-sensing mechanism enabling adaptation according to the oxygen content by controlling the transcription of > 1000 hypoxia-responsive genes. Among its functions, HIF coordinates the response to hypoxia by stimulating erythropoietin production in the kidneys and liver and favouring intestinal iron absorption and availability.

HIF is a heterodimeric DNA-binding complex composed of two basic helix–loop–helix proteins: one hypoxia-inducible α-subunit (HIF-1α, HIF-2α, HIF-3α) and the constitutive HIF-β. While HIF-α subunits are highly inducible by hypoxia, the HIF-β subunit is a non-oxygen-responsive nuclear protein with other roles in transcription processes. The HIF-2α subunit has been recognized as the primary mediator of erythropoiesis. HIF is regulated by a family of prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) enzymes, of which there are three isoforms (PHD1, PHD2, and PHD3) that serve as cellular oxygen sensors. In the presence of oxygen and/or iron, PHD enzymes hydroxylate prolines in HIF-α, thereby targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Under hypoxic conditions or iron deficiency, PHD enzyme activity is supressed and the HIF-α escapes proteasomal degradation and accumulates. It then translocates to the nucleus and dimerizes with HIF-β, forming the HIF-α/β heterodimer, which binds to the hypoxia response elements of target genes inducing, among other responses, erythropoiesis (Fig. 1).

### Increased plasma levels of erythropoietin after renal denervation in patients with resistant hypertension [^115u4icv]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Although the structure and function of Epo is well documented, apart from classical pathways of regulating renal Epo during hypoxia and anaemia, alternative pathways in regulation of the renal synthesis of Epo are still poorly understood. The kidney has rich innervation, which accompanies intrarenal blood vessels, and the sympathetic renal nerves are distributed to all segments of the intrarenal vasculature in the renal cortex. The peritubular fibroblasts in the renal cortex are the main production site of Epo after birth. Since the 1960s, multiple studies have investigated the role of renal nerves on Epo synthesis in a variety of RDN animal models, however, the published data in relation to changes in Epo synthesis are conflicting.

RDN has emerged as a novel treatment option for patients with resistant hypertension. The above-mentioned inconsistent results prompted us to investigate the influence of renal synthesis of Epo after RDN in humans. In the present study, we found that circulating Epo levels were increased after RDN. This is the first human data confirming changes in Epo levels after RDN and occurs in the absence of significant respiratory pathology causing hypoxia. The precise mechanism of how this occurs is currently unclear and will require concerted research effort to determine. We found our results to be consistent with most RDN animal studies. Fink et al. found that Epo levels were markedly reduced by bilateral RDN in 5 h, but after 18 h of hypoxia, plasma Epo levels in renal denervated rabbits did not differ significantly from those of sham-operated controls. The experimental observation time was too short, which may have been the possible reason for the difference in results. Other investigations, however, have indicated RDN had no effect on Epo production by hypoxic stimuli in rats. Indeed, hypoxia is known to be a reliable stimulus to increase Epo and is the principal driver of Epo production. Indeed, the classical example in humans is that of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in which chronic hypoxaemia drives increased Epo release, which can progress to polycythaemia.

### The human side of hypoxia-inducible factor [^113Acsig]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

Erythropoietic response to hypoxia

Though slower in onset than its cardiopulmonary counterparts, the development of polycythaemia has been the most widely known feature of acclimatisation since Viault first reported a proliferative effect of high altitude on his own red cell count. After years of subsequent conjecture, the existence of a humoral erythropoietic factor was eventually proven in rabbits by transfusing normal animals with plasma from severely anaemic donors, although human Epo was not isolated at sufficient purity to obtain a partial protein sequence until 1977. Hypoxia generates a detectable increase in serum Epo within 90 min. Following ascent to high altitude, Epo levels peak within 2 d and thereafter decline towards sea-level values over a period of 1–2 weeks. This decline occurs despite ongoing hypoxia and notably precedes most of the expansion of red cell mass. Haemoglobin (Hb) and haematocrit (Hct) are nevertheless elevated within days of ascent and red cell mass has been shown to continue rising for up to eight months and, for an altitude of 4500 m, approach a total increase of 50%. The polycythaemic response is therefore largely developed and maintained in the presence of relatively normal levels of Epo, as is the case when secondary polycythaemia results from hypoxic lung disease. The maximum expansion in red cell mass varies with the severity of hypoxia – at extreme altitudes, Hb > 210 g/l and Hct > 60% have been reported in acclimatising individuals. Values are naturally higher in high altitude natives, and for Andean males the normal Hb has been related to the arterial partial pressure of oxygen through an empirically-derived function, as depicted in Fig 1. Because of this relationship, the magnitude of erythrocytosis that is considered excessive and defines chronic mountain sickness varies with altitude.

Pais primarily determined by the altitude of residence, and for a given altitude, a Hb of more than two standard deviations above average is considered excessive.

### Modulation of hepcidin production during hypoxia-induced erythropoiesis in humans in vivo: data from the HIGHCARE project [^111VRwSf]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Iron is tightly connected to oxygen homeostasis and erythropoiesis. Our aim was to better understand how hypoxia regulates iron acquisition for erythropoiesis in humans, a topic relevant to common hypoxia-related disorders. Forty-seven healthy volunteers participated in the HIGHCARE project. Blood samples were collected at sea level and after acute and chronic exposure to high altitude (3400–5400 m above sea level). We investigated the modifications in hematocrit, serum iron indices, erythropoietin, markers of erythropoietic activity, interleukin-6, and serum hepcidin. Hepcidin decreased within 40 hours after acute hypoxia exposure (P < .05) at 3400 m, reaching the lowest level at 5400 m (80% reduction). Erythropoietin significantly increased (P < .001) within 16 hours after hypoxia exposure followed by a marked erythropoietic response supported by the increased iron supply. Growth differentiation factor-15 progressively increased during the study period. Serum ferritin showed a very rapid decrease, suggesting the existence of hypoxia-dependent mechanism(s) regulating storage iron mobilization. The strong correlation between serum ferritin and hepcidin at each point during the study indicates that iron itself or the kinetics of iron use in response to hypoxia may signal hepcidin down-regulation. The combined and significant changes in other variables probably contribute to the suppression of hepcidin in this setting.

### Nonrenal regulation of EPO synthesis [^111Y2HKz]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Erythropoietin (EPO) is a circulating glycoprotein hormone whose principal function is thought to be red blood cell production. It is a classic example of a hypoxia-inducible gene, and studies of the induction of EPO synthesis by low oxygen led to the discovery of a widespread system of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors. Tissue-specific expression of the EPO gene is tightly controlled, and in the adult organism the kidney produces around 90% of systemic EPO. Before birth, the liver is the main site of EPO production; factors contributing to the liver-to-kidney switch are still elusive, but may provide clues to the tissue-specificity of EPO gene expression. EPO has also been detected in non-erythropoietic tissues such as the brain, where it is suggested to exert local protective effects. Apart from classical ways of regulating renal EPO during hypoxia and anemia, novel pathways have been discovered that demonstrate that other organ systems in the adult might not only be important for the production of EPO but also for modulating the hypoxic EPO response. Knowledge of the molecular bases of these non-renal pathways will eventually help to develop pharmacological strategies to induce endogenous EPO production when the main source, the kidney, is significantly impaired. This review will provide an overview of the molecular aspects of EPO gene regulation by hypoxia-inducible transcription factors and of the tissue-specific regulation of EPO production in adult mammals. Insights into the biology of EPO production in genetically modified animals, with an emphasis on recent advances in the understanding of non-renal EPO regulation, will be discussed.

### New anemia therapies: translating novel strategies from bench to bedside [^1156UjFW]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Recombinant human erythropoietin (epoetin) has been available for the treatment of renal anemia for more than 20 years, and within the last decade two molecularly engineered analogues darbepoetin alfa and pegylated epoetin beta were introduced as longer-acting erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. Recently, newer strategies for correcting anemia have been explored, some of which remain in the laboratory while others are translating across into clinical trials. Peginesatide has completed phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease; this molecule is immunologically distinct from the erythropoietic proteins, with no cross-reactivity with anti-erythropoietin antibodies. HIF (hypoxia inducible factor) stabilization involves the pharmacologic inhibition of prolyl hydroxylation of HIF-α (the major transcription factor controlling erythropoietin gene expression), thereby preventing its degradation in the proteasome. Hepcidin is the master regulator of iron metabolism, and this peptide is upregulated in inflammatory conditions, including uremia; its antagonism has been shown to cause amelioration of inflammatory anemia in animal models. For the time being, erythropoiesis-stimulating agent therapy remains the mainstay of anemia management in chronic kidney disease, but it is possible that one or more of the strategies discussed in this review may have a future role in the treatment of this condition.
