## Question

How does terbutaline lower potassium and hyperkalemia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how terbutaline lowers potassium in hyperkalemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pharmacology of terbutaline and its beta-2 receptor selectivity. Then, I should verify the intracellular potassium shift mechanism at the cellular level. Next, I will review direct clinical evidence for terbutaline's potassium-lowering effect, followed by comparative data with albuterol and guideline positions. After that, I need to check onset, magnitude, and duration of effect, consider safety and monitoring, and finally integrate terbutaline into a stepwise hyperkalemia algorithm with caveats and alternatives.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic identity and receptor selectivity. Terbutaline is a short-acting, selective beta-2 adrenergic agonist bronchodilator; its beta-2 selectivity is the key property that links it mechanistically to potassium lowering, and the FDA labeling explicitly notes that beta-adrenergic agonists may produce significant hypokalemia, likely via intracellular shunting, which aligns with the expected mechanism of action [^114hm21w] [^113avVLg].

> Now, I need to verify the cellular mechanism. Beta-2 receptor stimulation activates adenylate cyclase, increases cAMP, and activates Na+/K+-ATPase, which pumps potassium into cells in exchange for sodium, thereby acutely decreasing serum potassium without altering total body potassium; this is the classic insulin-independent intracellular shift also leveraged by albuterol and is well-described in reviews of potassium homeostasis and emergency hyperkalemia management [^115EkJWM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should confirm direct clinical evidence for terbutaline itself. In hemodialysis patients with CKD, subcutaneous terbutaline 7 mcg/kg produced a mean potassium reduction of about 1.31 mEq/L with a corresponding increase in heart rate, supporting efficacy and the expected sympathomimetic effect; similarly, continuous IV terbutaline in pediatric critical asthma lowered serum potassium in all patients without requiring supplementation, reinforcing the class effect and clinical relevance of terbutaline's potassium-lowering property [^115mGi9x] [^112Yp2YQ].

> Next, I should review comparative and guideline data to contextualize magnitude and practice patterns. High-quality evidence and guidelines emphasize inhaled beta-2 agonists such as salbutamol/albuterol as standard agents for intracellular potassium shifting; nebulized salbutamol 10–20 mg lowers potassium by roughly 0.7–1.2 mmol/L within 60–120 minutes, and UK Kidney Association guidance recommends nebulized salbutamol as adjuvant therapy in moderate to severe hyperkalemia, reflecting the class effect that terbutaline shares as a beta-2 agonist [^114mdtLH] [^113p5yDq] [^1152AJgs].

> I will now examine onset, magnitude, and duration to guide bedside expectations. The intracellular shift with beta-2 agonists begins within about 10–30 minutes, peaks around 60–120 minutes, and lasts several hours; the terbutaline label notes effects can persist up to 6 hours or longer, which is consistent with the observed kinetics of albuterol and supports redosing or transition to definitive therapies as needed, though I should double-check for rebound risk after the effect wanes [^114hm21w] [^114mdtLH].

> Wait, let me verify safety and monitoring considerations because the cardiovascular profile matters. Beta-2 agonists can cause sinus tachycardia, palpitations, tremor, and, in some cases, arrhythmias; the FDA labeling advises caution in patients with cardiovascular disease and highlights that hypokalemia may itself predispose to arrhythmias, so continuous cardiac monitoring and serial potassium checks are prudent, especially in severe hyperkalemia or when combining with insulin-dextrose or in patients with ischemic heart disease [^114hm21w] [^113avVLg].

> But wait, what if the patient is on a beta-blocker — does that negate terbutaline's effect? I initially thought nonselective beta-blockade would blunt terbutaline's potassium-lowering effect, and that remains a reasonable physiological concern; however, I should confirm that clinical data are mixed and that some patients still respond, so terbutaline may still be attempted with close monitoring, recognizing a potentially attenuated effect when beta receptors are blocked [^117EKuwk].

> Next, I should review integration into a stepwise hyperkalemia algorithm. First, stabilize the myocardium with IV calcium if there are ECG changes or severe hyperkalemia; second, shift potassium intracellularly with insulin-dextrose and/or a beta-2 agonist such as nebulized albuterol or subcutaneous/intravenous terbutaline depending on availability and clinical context; third, remove potassium with binders or dialysis as indicated; terbutaline fits in the intracellular shift step as an alternative when albuterol is unavailable or when IV access is limited, with the caveat that nebulized albuterol has the strongest guideline endorsement and evidence base [^111ncDVe] [^113p5yDq] [^1152AJgs].

> I should double-check special populations and practical dosing. In hemodialysis patients without immediate access to dialysis, subcutaneous terbutaline 7 mcg/kg has evidence for meaningful potassium reduction; in pediatrics, continuous IV terbutaline lowered potassium without requiring supplementation, though careful hemodynamic monitoring is essential; conversely, in patients with significant coronary disease or tachyarrhythmias, the risk-benefit balance may favor avoiding sympathomimetics or using them with extreme caution and continuous monitoring [^115mGi9x] [^112Yp2YQ] [^114hm21w].

> Let me reconsider the mechanism one more time to ensure internal consistency. The absence of change in total body potassium means rebound hyperkalemia is possible as the beta-2 effect wanes, so serial potassium checks and transition to removal strategies are critical; this is why guidelines emphasize monitoring for rebound and aligning temporizing shifts with definitive potassium removal when feasible [^112RLHGt].

> In summary, terbutaline lowers serum potassium by activating beta-2 receptors, increasing cAMP, and stimulating Na+/K+-ATPase to shift potassium intracellularly, producing an average reduction of roughly 0.5–1.3 mmol/L within 30–120 minutes with effects lasting several hours; clinically, it is a reasonable alternative to albuterol for intracellular shifting when albuterol is unavailable, used alongside insulin-dextrose as needed, with vigilant cardiac and laboratory monitoring to mitigate sympathomimetic risks and detect rebound [^115mGi9x] [^112Yp2YQ] [^114mdtLH] [^113p5yDq].

---

Terbutaline lowers serum potassium by **activating β2-adrenergic receptors**, which stimulates Na+/K+-ATPase and shifts potassium intracellularly [^115mGi9x]. This effect is **rapid and transient**, typically lowering potassium by 0.5–1.2 mmol/L within 30–60 minutes and lasting 2–6 hours [^116HEr1A]. Clinically, terbutaline is used as adjunct therapy for acute hyperkalemia, especially when insulin is contraindicated or unavailable [^115mGi9x], but requires **cardiac monitoring** due to risk of tachycardia and arrhythmias [^115mGi9x].

---

## Mechanism of action

Terbutaline is a selective β2-adrenergic agonist that **activates β2-receptors** on skeletal muscle and hepatocytes, increasing cAMP and activating Na+/K+-ATPase [^117JcTf9]. This pumps potassium into cells and lowers serum potassium within 30–60 minutes [^114mdtLH]; the effect is transient, typically lasting 2–6 hours, and does not alter total body potassium [^116MgUnZ].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting terbutaline use in hyperkalemia

Several studies and case reports demonstrate terbutaline's efficacy in lowering serum potassium:

- **Hemodialysis patients**: Subcutaneous terbutaline (7 mcg/kg) reduced mean serum potassium by 1.31 ± 0.5 mEq/L (P < 0.001) [^115mGi9x].
- **Pediatric ICU**: Continuous IV terbutaline reduced serum potassium by 0.5–1.0 mEq/L without requiring supplementation [^notfound].
- **Case report**: IV terbutaline overdose caused profound hypokalemia (3.1 mmol/L), confirming potent intracellular potassium shift [^1118cTPs].

---

## Comparison with other β2-agonists

Terbutaline's potassium-lowering effect is comparable to other β2-agonists (e.g. albuterol, salbutamol) [^115mGi9x] [^115EkJWM]. Albuterol lowers potassium by ~0.5–1.2 mmol/L within 30–60 minutes; terbutaline produces a similar magnitude and onset, though **individual response varies** with dose, route, and patient factors [^115EkJWM] [^114mdtLH] [^115mGi9x].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines recommend β2-agonists as adjuncts for acute hyperkalemia, particularly when insulin is contraindicated or unavailable [^113p5yDq]. Terbutaline is a reasonable alternative, especially in settings where nebulized albuterol is unavailable or impractical [^115mGi9x].

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

Terbutaline is generally safe but requires **careful monitoring**:

- **Cardiovascular effects**: Tachycardia, arrhythmias, and hypertension may occur, especially in patients with cardiovascular disease [^114hm21w].
- **Hypokalemia**: Excessive β2-agonist use can cause significant hypokalemia, potentially leading to arrhythmias [^114EC9Ki].
- **Monitoring**: Continuous cardiac monitoring and frequent serum potassium checks are recommended during administration [^115mGi9x].

---

## Limitations and contraindications

Limitations and contraindications include **limited evidence**, with fewer high-quality trials than albuterol; **cardiovascular risk**, warranting caution or avoidance in patients with significant heart disease, arrhythmias, or uncontrolled hypertension; and **rebound hyperkalemia**, which can occur as the effect wanes, necessitating ongoing monitoring and definitive potassium removal strategies [^111ncDVe].

---

## Clinical scenarios for terbutaline use

Terbutaline is particularly useful when **insulin is contraindicated** (e.g. allergy, severe hypoglycemia risk) or unavailable, in resource-limited settings where nebulized albuterol is unavailable, and as adjunctive therapy combined with insulin and glucose or other agents for synergistic intracellular potassium shifting [^115mGi9x].

---

Terbutaline lowers serum potassium by **activating β2-receptors** and shifting potassium intracellularly, providing a rapid, transient effect useful as adjunct therapy in acute hyperkalemia. It requires **careful monitoring** due to cardiovascular risks and rebound potential.

### Subcutaneous terbutaline use in CKD to reduce potassium concentrations [^115mGi9x]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Acute hyperkalemia is a frequent and potentially life-threatening medical problem in patients on maintenance hemodialysis therapy. beta-Adrenergic receptor (betaAR) stimulation causes potassium cellular influx and a decline in plasma potassium concentrations. Therefore, betaAR agonists are used in the treatment of patients with hyperkalemia. The goal of this study is to evaluate the utility of weight-based subcutaneous terbutaline dosing to reduce plasma potassium concentrations in a group of subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD) requiring hemodialysis.

Methods

Fourteen subjects with CKD receiving long-term hemodialysis were administered terbutaline, 7 microg/kg, subcutaneously. Heart rate measurements and blood samples for potassium concentration determinations were made serially for 420 minutes. Effects of terbutaline on heart rate and potassium responses were determined in each subject.

Results

Terbutaline significantly reduced plasma potassium concentrations and significantly increased heart rates during the time course of the study (P < 0.001, repeated-measures analysis of variance). Mean reduction in peak potassium concentration (-1.31 ± 0.5 [SD] mEq/L) and increase in peak heart rate (25.8 ± 10.5 beats/min) were significantly different from baseline (P < 0.001, baseline versus peak for both responses). No subject reported significant adverse effects.

Conclusion

Administration of subcutaneous terbutaline obviates the need for intravenous access and should be considered as an alternative to nebulized or inhaled beta-agonists to treat acute hyperkalemia in patients with CKD. As with the use of any beta-adrenergic agonist, close cardiovascular monitoring is necessary to avoid or minimize toxicity during therapy.

### Pharmacological interventions for the acute management of hyperkalaemia in adults [^114mdtLH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperkalaemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disturbance which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and death. Renal replacement therapy is known to be effective in treating hyperkalaemia, but safe and effective pharmacological interventions are needed to prevent dialysis or avoid the complications of hyperkalaemia until dialysis is performed.

Objectives

This review looked at the benefits and harms of pharmacological treatments used in the acute management of hyperkalaemia in adults. This review evaluated the therapies that reduce serum potassium as well as those that prevent complications of hyperkalaemia.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 18 August 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs looking at any pharmacological intervention for the acute management of hyperkalaemia in adults were included in this review. Non-standard study designs such as cross-over studies were also included. Eligible studies enrolled adults (aged 18 years and over) with hyperkalaemia, defined as serum potassium concentration ≥ 4.9 mmol/L, to receive pharmacological therapy to reduce serum potassium or to prevent arrhythmias. Patients with artificially induced hyperkalaemia were excluded from this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

All three authors screened titles and abstracts, and data extraction and risk of bias assessment was performed independently by at least two authors. Studies reported in non-English language journals were translated before assessment. Authors were contacted when information about results or study methodology was missing from the original publication. Although we planned to group all studies of a particular pharmacological therapy regardless of administration route or dose for analysis, we were unable to conduct meta-analyses because of the small numbers of studies evaluating any given treatment. For continuous data we reported mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included seven studies (241 participants) in this review. Meta-analysis of these seven included studies was not possible due to heterogeneity of the treatments and because many of the studies did not provide sufficient statistical information with their results. Allocation and blinding methodology was poorly described in most studies. No study evaluated the efficacy of pharmacological interventions for preventing clinically relevant outcomes such as mortality and cardiac arrhythmias; however there is evidence that several commonly used therapies effectively reduce serum potassium levels. Salbutamol administered via either nebulizer or metered-dose inhaler (MDI) significantly reduced serum potassium compared with placebo. The peak effect of 10 mg nebulised salbutamol was seen at 120 minutes (MD -1.29 mmol/L, 95% CI -1.64 to -0.94) and at 90 minutes for 20 mg nebulised salbutamol (1 study: MD -1.18 mmol/L, 95% CI -1.54 to -0.82). One study reported 1.2 mg salbutamol via MDI 1.2 mg produced a significant decrease in serum potassium beginning at 10 minutes (MD -0.20 mmol/L, P < 0.05) and a maximal decrease at 60 minutes (MD -0.34 mmol/L, P < 0.0001). Intravenous (IV) and nebulised salbutamol produced comparable effects (2 studies). When compared to other interventions, salbutamol had similar effect to insulin-dextrose (2 studies) but was more effective than bicarbonate at 60 minutes (MD -0.46 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.10; 1 study). Insulin-dextrose was more effective than IV bicarbonate (1 study) and aminophylline (1 study). Insulin-dextrose, bicarbonate and aminophylline were not studied in any placebo-controlled studies. None of the included studies evaluated the effect of IV calcium or potassium binding resins in the treatment of hyperkalaemia.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence for the acute pharmacological management of hyperkalaemia is limited, with no clinical studies demonstrating a reduction in adverse patient outcomes. Of the studied agents, salbutamol via any route and IV insulin-dextrose appear to be most effective at reducing serum potassium. There is limited evidence to support the use of other interventions, such as IV sodium bicarbonate or aminophylline. The effectiveness of potassium binding resins and IV calcium salts has not been tested in RCTs and requires further study before firm recommendations for clinical practice can be made.

### Emergency interventions for hyperkalaemia [^111ow1WE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperkalaemia occurs in outpatients and in between 1% and 10% of hospitalised patients. When severe, consequences include arrhythmia and death.

Objectives

To review randomised evidence informing the emergency (i.e. acute, rather than chronic) management of hyperkalaemia

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE (1966–2003), EMBASE (1980–2003), The Cochrane Library (issue 4, 2003), and SciSearch using the text words hyperkal* or hyperpotass* (* indicates truncation). We also searched selected journals and abstracts of meetings. The reference lists of recent review articles, textbooks, and relevant papers were reviewed for additional potentially relevant titles.

Selection Criteria

All selection was performed in duplicate. Articles were considered relevant if they were randomised, quasi-randomised or cross-over randomised studies of pharmacological or other interventions to treat non-neonatal humans with hyperkalaemia, reporting on clinically-important outcomes, or serum potassium levels within the first six hours of administration.

Data Collection and Analysis

All data extraction was performed in duplicate. We extracted quality information, and details of the patient population, intervention, baseline and follow-up potassium values. We extracted information about arrhythmias, mortality and adverse effects. Where possible, meta-analysis was performed using random effects models.

Main Results

None of the studies of clinically-relevant hyperkalaemia reported mortality or cardiac arrhythmias. Reports focussed on serum potassium levels. Many studies were small, and not all intervention groups had sufficient data for meta-analysis to be performed. On the basis of small studies, inhaled beta-agonists, nebulised beta-agonists, and intravenous (IV) insulin-and-glucose were all effective, and the combination of nebulised beta agonists with IV insulin-and-glucose was more effective than either alone. Dialysis is effective. Results were equivocal for IV bicarbonate. K-absorbing resin was not effective by four hours, and longer follow up data on this intervention were not available from RCTs.

Authors' Conclusions

Nebulised or inhaled salbutamol, or IV insulin-and-glucose are the first-line therapies for the management of emergency hyperkalaemia that are best supported by the evidence. Their combination may be more effective than either alone, and should be considered when hyperkalaemia is severe. When arrhythmias are present, a wealth of anecdotal and animal data suggests that IV calcium is effective in treating arrhythmia. Further studies of the optimal use of combination treatments and of the adverse effects of treatments are needed.

### Rebound hyperkalemia after cessation of intravenous tocolytic therapy with terbutaline in the treatment of preterm labor: anesthetic implications [^114r6EA4]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2003). Low credibility.

Beta-adrenergic agents have been widely used in obstetrics to attenuate premature labor (termed tocolytic therapy), delay delivery, allow fetal maturation, and thereby reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality. Hypokalemia is a common side effect during beta-adrenergic tocolytic therapy for the treatment of preterm labor. Although rebound hyperkalemia after cessation of tocolytic therapy with ritodrine has been reported, there have been no reports of hyperkalemia occurring after the cessation of beta-adrenergic tocolytic therapy with terbutaline for preterm labor; we report such a case.

### Best evidence topic report. nebulised levalbuterol or albuterol for lowering serum potassium [^114mPYVK]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

A short cut review was carried out to establish whether nebulised levalbuterol is better than or equivalent to albuterol for lowering serum potassium. Seven papers were found using the reported search, of which three presented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses of these best papers are tabulated. A clinical bottom line is stated.

### An evidence-based narrative review of the emergency department management of acute hyperkalemia [^111ncDVe]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The normal range for potassium is within narrow limits. Hyperkalemia is an electrolyte disorder that frequently affects patients in the emergency department (ED), and can result in significant morbidity and mortality if not identified and treated rapidly.

Objective

This article provides an evidence-based narrative review of the management of hyperkalemia, with focused updates for the emergency clinician.

Methods

We searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases for articles in English published in peer-reviewed journals and indexed up until May 2020. We used multiple search terms, including hyperkalemia, potassium, acute hyperkalemia, emergency department, dyskalemia, potassium disorders, kidney disease, epidemiology, electrolyte disturbance, severe hyperkalemia, and emergency management.

Discussion

In the ED, interventions aimed to protect patients from the immediate dangers of elevated serum potassium are divided into the following: stabilizing cardiac membrane potentials, reducing serum potassium levels through shift from the extracellular fluid to intracellular fluid, and elimination of potassium through excretion via urinary or fecal excretion. Calcium is widely recommended to stabilize the myocardial cell membrane, but additional research is necessary to establish criteria for use, dosages, and preferred solutions. Redistribution of potassium ions from the bloodstream into the cells is based on intravenous insulin or nebulized β2-agonists.

Conclusions

Hyperkalemia is a frequent electrolyte disorder in the ED. Because of the risk of fatal dysrhythmia due to cardiac membrane instability, hyperkalemia is a medical emergency. There is a lack of scientific evidence on the optimal management of hyperkalemia and more research is needed to establish optimal strategies to manage acute hyperkalemia in the emergency department.

### Pharmacological interventions for the acute treatment of hyperkalaemia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116HEr1A]. Resuscitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperkalaemia is a life-threatening electrolyte disturbance and also a potential cause of cardiac arrest. The objective was to assess the effects of acute pharmacological interventions for the treatment of hyperkalaemia in patients with and without cardiac arrest.

Methods

The review was reported according to PRISMA guidelines and registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023440553). We searched OVID Medline, EMBASE, and CENTRAL on September 9, 2024 for randomized trials, non-randomized trials, observational studies, and experimental animal studies. Two investigators performed abstract screening, full-text review, data extraction, and bias assessment. Outcomes included potassium levels, ECG findings, and clinical outcomes. Certainty of evidence was evaluated using GRADE.

Results

A total of 101 studies were included, with two studies including patients with cardiac arrest. In meta-analyses including adult patients without cardiac arrest, treated with insulin in combination with glucose, inhaled salbutamol, intravenous salbutamol dissolved in glucose, or a combination, the average reduction in potassium was between 0.7 and 1.2 mmol/l (very low to low certainty of evidence). The use of bicarbonate had no effect on potassium levels (very low certainty of evidence). In neonatal and paediatric populations, inhaled salbutamol and intravenous salbutamol reduced the average potassium between 0.9 and 1.0 mmol/l (very low to low certainty of evidence). There was no evidence to support a clinical beneficial effect of calcium for treatment of hyperkalemia.

Conclusions

Evidence supports treatment with insulin in combination with glucose, inhaled or intravenous sal-butamol, or the combination. No evidence supporting a clinical effect of calcium or bicarbonate for hyperkalaemia was identified.

### Levalbuterol is as effective as racemic albuterol in lowering serum potassium [^116Vv7VQ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Albuterol is an effective treatment for hyperkalemia through beta-adrenergic induction of potassium (K+) uptake. Levalbuterol, the R-enantiomer of racemic albuterol, is used for the treatment of asthma and 0.63 mg of levalbuterol has the same therapeutic efficacy as 2.5 mg of albuterol but with a decreased adverse effects profile. We hypothesized that levalbuterol can reduce serum K+ levels similarly to albuterol when used in equipotent doses. In a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled prospective study, we compared the K+-lowering effects of nebulized saline and equipotent bronchodilatory doses of albuterol (10 mg) and levalbuterol (2.5 mg) in healthy adult volunteers. Nine subjects entered each of the three study groups. Serum K+ was measured at baseline, at 30 min (immediately after treatment), at 60 min, and at 90 min. All adverse effects were recorded. The three groups had similar baseline K+ values. Immediately after nebulization, only levalbuterol showed a significant decrease in potassium level (p = 0.024). At 30 and 60 min after treatment, both albuterol and levalbuterol groups had significantly lower K+ values compared to placebo. No significant difference occurred between the albuterol and levalbuterol groups. Levalbuterol caused fewer reported adverse effects compared to albuterol.

### Hyperkalemia [^116MgUnZ]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening metabolic problem caused by inability of the kidneys to excrete potassium, impairment of the mechanisms that move potassium from the circulation into the cells, or a combination of these factors. Acute episodes of hyperkalemia commonly are triggered by the introduction of a medication affecting potassium homeostasis; illness or dehydration also can be triggers. In patients with diabetic nephropathy, hyperkalemia may be caused by the syndrome of hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism. The presence of typical electrocardiographic changes or a rapid rise in serum potassium indicates that hyperkalemia is potentially life threatening. Urine potassium, creatinine, and osmolarity should be obtained as a first step in determining the cause of hyperkalemia, which directs long-term treatment. Intravenous calcium is effective in reversing electrocardiographic changes and reducing the risk of arrhythmias but does not lower serum potassium. Serum potassium levels can be lowered acutely by using intravenous insulin and glucose, nebulized beta2 agonists, or both. Sodium polystyrene therapy, sometimes with intravenous furosemide and saline, is then initiated to lower total body potassium levels.

### Assessment of patiromer monotherapy for hyperkalemia in an acute care setting [^112McLuk]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has limitations. First, the study did not have a control group; therefore, whether observed reductions in potassium levels were associated with patiromer alone could not be determined. Nevertheless, we took care to exclude instances of coadministration with other potassium-lowering agents, including insulin, furosemide, albuterol, and other potassium binders. Furthermore, the intent of our study was to evaluate outcomes associated with patiromer administration in a real-world clinical setting and to quantify the potassium level reduction associated with this agent. In addition, the absence of a protocol for treatment and monitoring of hyperkalemia required us to exclude observations from our analysis in each time interval if a laboratory blood sample was not obtained. Whereas this may have influenced the overall potassium-lowering estimates (eg, patients with higher baseline potassium levels may have been more likely to receive earlier or more frequent monitoring), we evaluated potassium level reduction in both absolute and relative terms as well as stratified by baseline potassium levels, which provided findings consistent with the overall end points.

Our analysis of the clinical practice context indicated wide variability and inconsistent follow-up monitoring. Further research should explore implementation of protocols for treatment, including novel potassium binders, for non–life-threatening hyperkalemia in an acute care setting.

Regarding medical management for hyperkalemia, more specifically with respect to indications for urgent treatment, UKKA 2023 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining hospital assessment in acutely unwell patients with mild (serum potassium 5.5–5.9 mmol/l) or moderate hyperkalemia (serum potassium 6.0–6.4 mmol/l), particularly in the presence of AKI.

It's complicated!

Of course, the above model is an over-simplification. Potassium homoeostasis is not independent from the many other facets of systemic physiology and we are continually learning about new pieces in the puzzle. One particularly intriguing story that has emerged in recent years is that of the circadian influences on potassium excretion. Renal potassium excretion follows a circadian rhythm, being highest around noon and lowest around midnight. Renal tubular cells possess an intrinsic molecular clock that is now well-characterized. This is synchronized with the central (brain) clock, in part through glucocorticoid signalling.

It follows that the risk of hyperkalemia is almost certainly influenced by the timing of meals, potassium loads and drug administrations. Could this be exploited to minimize the risk of hyperkalemia in high-risk patients?

Hyperkalemia from transcellular potassium shifts

The huge size of the intracellular potassium store means that transcellular shifts can have large and rapid effects on plasma [K +]. Potassium shifted from the intra- to the extracellular space are induced by acute metabolic acidosis and opposed by insulin and β-adrenergic signalling. Widespread cell death (as in tumour lysis or rhabdomyolysis) may also release potassium from the intracellular space.

Transcellular shifts can be quantitatively more important than external potassium load, as was demonstrated by randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of perioperative intravenous fluid therapy in kidney transplant recipients. Patients randomized to receive 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl; containing no potassium) had a greater incidence of hyperkalemia than those randomized to receive plasmalyte-148 (containing 4 mM potassium). The likely explanation for this apparent paradox is that chloride-rich 0.9% NaCl induces metabolic acidosis, whereas buffered plasmalyte-148 does not.

### A physiologic-based approach to the treatment of acute hyperkalemia [^1158EG2z]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common and potentially lethal disorder. Given its variable presentation, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease. The present case highlights key physiologic mechanisms in the development of hyperkalemia and provides an outline for emergent treatment. In this context, we discuss specific mechanisms of action of available treatments of hyperkalemia.

### Management of severe hyperkalemia [^116Vgddg]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Hyperkalemia is one of the few potentially lethal electrolyte disturbances. Prompt recognition and expeditious treatment of severe hyperkalemia are expected to save lives. This review is intended to provide intensivists and other interested clinicians with an understanding of the pathophysiology that underlies hyperkalemia, and a rational approach to its management.

Methods

This article reviews and analyzes literature relevant to the pathophysiology and management of severe hyperkalemia. Methods include search of MEDLINE, and bibliographic search of current textbooks and journal articles.

Results and Conclusions

A more complete understanding of potassium homeostasis in recent years has led to new approaches to the management of severe hyperkalemia. The physiologically based sequential approach still applies. The efficacy, pitfalls, and risks of the agents available for use at each step in the sequence are critically reviewed. Rational use of the available tools will allow clinicians to successfully treat severe hyperkalemia.

### Management of hyperkalemia: an update for the internist [^112sDH5S]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a clinically important electrolyte abnormality that occurs most commonly in patients with chronic kidney disease. Due to its propensity to induce electrophysiological disturbances, severe hyperkalemia is considered a medical emergency. The management of acute and chronic hyperkalemia can be achieved through the implementation of various interventions, one of which is the elimination of medications that can raise serum potassium levels. Because many such medications (especially inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system) have shown beneficial effects in patients with cardiovascular and renal disease, their discontinuation for reasons of hyperkalemia represent an undesirable clinical compromise. The emergence of 2 new potassium-binding medications for acute and chronic therapy of hyperkalemia may soon allow the continued use of medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors even in patients who are prone to hyperkalemia. This review article provides an overview of the physiology and the pathophysiology of potassium metabolism and hyperkalemia, the epidemiology of hyperkalemia, and its acute and chronic management. We discuss in detail emerging data about new potassium-lowering therapies, and their potential future role in clinical practice.

### Hyperkalemia treatment standard [^11415M5d]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disturbance in both inpatient and outpatient clinical practice. The severity and associated risk depends on the underlying cause and rate of potassium (K+) increase. Acute hyperkalemia requires immediate attention due to potentially life-threatening manifestations resulting from the rapid increase in plasma K+ concentration. Treatment is initially focused on stabilizing the cardiac membrane, followed by maneuvers to shift K+ into the cells, and ultimately initiating strategies to decrease total body K+ content. Chronic hyperkalemia develops over a more extended period of time and manifestations tend to be less severe. Nevertheless, the disorder is not benign since chronic hyperkalemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The approach to patients with chronic hyperkalemia begins with a review of medications potentially responsible for the disorder, ensuring effective diuretic therapy and correcting metabolic acidosis if present. The practice of restricting foods high in K+ to manage hyperkalemia is being reassessed since the evidence supporting the effectiveness of this strategy is lacking. Rather, dietary restriction should be more nuanced, focusing on reducing the intake of nonplant sources of K+. Down-titration and/or discontinuation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors should be discouraged since these drugs improve outcomes in patients with heart failure and proteinuric kidney disease. In addition to other conservative measures, K+ binding drugs and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors can assist in maintaining the use of these drugs.

2 SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND

2.1 Definition of hyperkalemia

Hyperkalemia can be classified as acute (as occurring in an emergent setting), chronic, or recurrent, depending on the onset and number of hyperkalemia episodes that have occurred. The decision of whether emergency therapy is warranted is largely based on subjective clinical judgement. The lack of robust and evidence‐based treatment guidelines for the management of hyperkalemia in the emergency department poses a challenge for treatment.

Although the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), and other organizations, such as the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), and Hearth Failure Society of America (HFSA)have issued guidelines, the concentration of potassium that is labelled as hyperkalemia varies. Serum potassium concentrations of 5.0,5.5, or 6.0 mmol/Lare commonly used cutoffs for the definition of hyperkalemia.

The KDIGO controversies' conference report defines the severity of hyperkalemia by both serum potassium concentration and ECG changes. The most common ECG change is peaked T waves, followed by QRS prolongation. Hyperkalemia is classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on potassium concentration and the presence or absence of ECG changes. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 5.0–5.9 mmol/L are typically defined as mild and ≥ 6.0–6.4 mmol/L as moderate. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 6.5 mmol/L are typically defined as severe.

### Management of hyperkalemia in dialysis patients [^1135xxxy]. Seminars in Dialysis (2007). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is common in patients with end-stage renal disease, and may result in serious electrocardiographic abnormalities. Dialysis is the definitive treatment of hyperkalemia in these patients. Intravenous calcium is used to stabilize the myocardium. Intravenous insulin and nebulized albuterol lower serum potassium acutely, by shifting it into the cells. Despite their widespread use, neither intravenous bicarbonate nor cation exchange resins are effective in lowering serum potassium acutely. Prevention of hyperkalemia currently rests largely upon dietary compliance and avoidance of medications that may promote hyperkalemia. Prolonged fasting may provoke hyperkalemia, which can be prevented by administration of intravenous dextrose.

### Effect of nebulized albuterol on serum lactate and potassium in healthy subjects [^114xC8hQ]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objectives were to determine if nebulized albuterol causes an increase in the serum lactate level compared to placebo and, secondarily, to confirm that albuterol decreases serum potassium levels compared to placebo in patients with normokalemia.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Twenty-eight healthy adult volunteers were assigned to receive either 10 mg of nebulized albuterol or placebo (nebulized saline) over 1 hour. Serum lactate was measured prior to treatment and at 30 and 70 minutes after the start of treatment. Serum potassium level was measured prior to treatment and at 70 minutes. The primary outcome was the degree of change in lactate level. The secondary outcome was the degree of change in potassium level.

Results

In the 14 subjects who received albuterol, the mean increase in lactate was 0.77 mmol/L (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.52 to 1.02 mmol/L), and the mean decrease in potassium level was 0.5 mEq/L (95% CI = -0.72 to -0.28 mEq/L). Among the subjects who received placebo, the lactate level decreased by 0.15 mmol/L (95% CI = -0.39 to 0.09 mmol/L) and there was no change in potassium level at (0.0 mEq/L [95% CI = -0.21 to 0.21 mEq/L]). These differences are statistically significant (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.003, respectively).

Conclusion

Nebulized albuterol increases lactate levels and decreases potassium levels in healthy adults.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: foe or friend? [^111R1PtP]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

5 PROTECTIVE EFFECTS OF POTASSIUM

Diets high in potassium have been associated with a lower incidence of hypertension and heart failure. 37 Experimental data show that high potassium protects against hypertensive and sodium‐induced endothelial dysfunction, independently of blood pressure. 38, 39, 40 In animal models, increasing plasma potassium improves endothelial function and arterial stiffness, reducing the rate of thrombosis on endothelial lesions. 39, 40 Notably, high potassium levels have been shown to have protective effects against stroke and kidney disease in hypertensive rats. 41

In general terms, serum potassium 4 to 4.9 mEq/L is optimal and 5 to 5.5 mEq/L appears relatively safe in HF. 7 In a large cohort of patients with acute HF, patients with higher serum potassium were found to have a better diuretic response and low potassium was one of the strongest predictors of a poor diuretic response. 16 It also appears that eGFR is lower in HF patients with higher potassium levels, which probably means that high potassium levels reflect worse renal function and may be a risk marker rather than a risk factor. 16

In the EPHESUS trial, eplerenone also reduced the risk of hypokalemia, which was twice as large as the risk of serious hyperkalemia. 32 Important findings from EMPHASIS‐HF suggest that the favorable effects of eplerenone on all‐cause death were independent of the incidence of hyperkalemia or worsening renal function. 42, 43 On the other hand, a sub‐study from the RALES trial in chronic HF found that an increase in potassium levels after spironolactone treatment was not associated with an increase in mortality. 31 In the RALES trial, the benefit of spironolactone was maintained in the setting of moderate hyperkalemia, and clinical outcomes with spironolactone were superior to those with placebo when potassium levels remained < 6.0 mEq/L. 31 In this trial, 13.5% and 40% of participants exhibited hyperkalemia when treated with 25 and 50 mg daily of spironolactone, indicating that hyperkalemia in HF is not always an ominous sign. Results from a recent, large, network‐wide analysis suggested that there was no difference in outcomes between patients with normal or mildly elevated potassium levels. 31 Notably, serious hyperkalemia occurred in only 2% and 1% of patients in the spironolactone and placebo arms, respectively. 31

### Safety of terbutaline for treatment of acute severe pediatric asthma [^112Yp2YQ]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

The use of continuous intravenous terbutaline treatment in severe asthma attacks has been hampered by the lack of well-powered clinical trials where effects of such treatment are described in detail. Here, we aimed to provide a descriptive report on the largest cohort of severe pediatric asthma patients treated with terbutaline.

Methods

The study was conducted in a pediatric intensive care unit in a large metropolitan tertiary care university hospital on 124 patients receiving terbutaline infusion. To stratify the effect of, and determine any age-related differences of, terbutaline, the patients were divided into 3 age groups (0–6 years, 7–12 years, and 13–18 years). Clinical response and the potential harmful effects of terbutaline infusion were determined.

Results

There were significant reductions in systolic (varying between 86% and 93% of the baseline) and diastolic blood pressures (varying between 74% and 86% of the baseline level). However, the values returned to baseline level shortly after discontinuation of infusion. Terbutaline increased heart rates in all groups shortly after initiation (9%-13% above baseline), which returned to below baseline levels 1 hour after discontinuation. Serum potassium levels were also reduced in all patients compared to their baseline values after initiation of terbutaline infusion. However, none of the subjects required potassium replacement.

Conclusions

The results indicate that overall, terbutaline infusion was well tolerated without irreversible adverse effects of the treatment. Although hemodynamic and metabolic disturbances occurred, these were clinically easily managed and posed little risk in emergency department or pediatric intensive care unit.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: probably not O"K" [^111b1mZi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is routinely defined as a serum potassium level > 5 mmol/L and is a common occurrence in patients with acute and chronic heart failure (HF). For example, prior work has demonstrated that hyperkalemia is present in ≈9% of patients admitted for acute HF, 1 and the total annual charges for Medicare admissions related to a primary diagnosis of hyperkalemia are substantial, with estimates as high as $697 million in 2011. 2 Elevated potassium levels may affect the activity of myocardial potassium channels, leading to more rapid membrane depolarization. The downstream effects of this may translate into slower myocardial electrical conduction, resulting in malignant tachyarrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias. Hyperkalemia, especially with potassium levels > 5.5 mmol/L, has been consistently linked to poor clinical outcomes in patients with HF. 3, 4 Recent estimates from the PARADIGM‐HF (Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure) trial suggest the incidence of hyperkalemia in a trial population receiving treatment with renin‐angiotensin system inhibition (RASi) was ≈16% over a median follow‐up time of 27 months, despite a highly selected and carefully monitored clinical trial population. 5 Similarly, in a large cohort from the United Kingdom of 19 194 patients with new‐onset HF, 11% developed hyperkalemia during a 4‐year follow‐up. 6 Multiple prior analyses of clinical trials and population‐based studies identify renal dysfunction, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and the use of mineralocorticoid antagonists (MRAs) and RASi as major risk factors for hyperkalemia. Given that 5.7 million people in the United States alone have HF and this number is increasing, there is an overwhelming number of patients at risk for hyperkalemia and associated adverse events. 7 Patients with HF are at a particularly high risk for hyperkalemia, which is likely reflective of their medical comorbidity, including renal dysfunction. In addition, several of the current medical therapies for the management of HF with reduced ejection fraction (EF) add to this risk. These include cornerstone therapies, such as the following: (1) RASi, including angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor inhibitors with or without neprilysin inhibition; and (2) MRAs, such as spironolactone and eplerenone. Whether a consequence of a real or perceived risk of hyperkalemia, evidence supports that these therapies are underused, and when used there is suboptimal dose titration. 8, 9 Although there are data to support that mild hyperkalemia (potassium level, 5–5.5 mmol/L) in the setting of RASi and MRA therapy might not be associated with poor clinical outcomes, hyperkalemia in HF remains a major clinical dilemma. 3, 10

The treatment of hyperkalemia involves a stepwise approach to stabilize the myocardium, drive potassium into cells, and remove excess potassium from the patient. Initially, to stabilize the myocardium, calcium chloride or gluconate is administered slowly as an intravenous push in severe hyperkalemia. Monitoring serum calcium levels after each dose is crucial to avoid potential hypercalcemia, with preference given to assessing serum ionized calcium levels alongside cardiac monitoring. Due to the short-lived effect, repeated doses may be necessary. To drive potassium into cells, a combination of dextrose plus insulin infusion is utilized and is considered one of the most potent treatments for hyperkalemia short of hemodialysis. This approach facilitates the intracellular shift of potassium in exchange for sodium, and careful insulin dosing is essential to prevent hypoglycemia. In the presence of acidosis, the pH is increased through methods such as hyperventilation, NaHCO3 administration, or a combination of both. However, caution is exercised and bicarbonate should not be administered to patients with a pH exceeding 7.4. Repeated sodium bicarbonate administration may be complicated by hypernatremia, volume overload, and hypocalcemia. Additionally, beta-2 agonists (salbutamol, albuterol) and sodium bicarbonate contribute to decreasing potassium levels by promoting the movement of potassium into cells.

### Terbutaline sulfate [^114hm21w]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

Terbutaline, as with all sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, including ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias; hyperthyroidism; diabetes mellitus; hypersensitivity to sympathomimetic amines; and convulsive disorders. Significant changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure have been seen and could be expected to occur in some patients after use of any beta-adrenergic bronchodilator.

Immediate hypersensitivity reactions and exacerbation of bronchospasm have been reported after terbutaline administration.

Beta-adrenergic agonist medications may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease is usually transient, not requiring supplementation.

Large doses of intravenous terbutaline sulfate have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes and ketoacidosis.

Information for Patients

The action of terbutaline sulfate should last up to 6 hours or longer. Terbutaline sulfate should not be used more frequently than recommended. Do not increase the dose or frequency of terbutaline sulfate without consulting your physician. If you find that treatment with terbutaline sulfate becomes less effective for symptomatic relief, your symptoms become worse, and/or you need to use the product more frequently than usual, you should seek medical attention immediately. While taking terbutaline sulfate, other inhaled drugs and asthma medications should be taken only as directed by your physician. Common adverse effects include palpitations, chest pain, rapid heart rate, tremor or nervousness. If you are pregnant or nursing, contact your physician about use of terbutaline sulfate. Effective and safe use of terbutaline sulfate includes an understanding of the way that it should be administered.

Drug Interactions

The concomitant use of terbutaline sulfate with other sympathomimetic agents is not recommended, since the combined effect on the cardiovascular system may be deleterious to the patient. However, this does not preclude the use of an aerosol bronchodilator of the adrenergic-stimulant type for the relief of an acute bronchospasm in patients receiving chronic oral therapy with terbutaline sulfate.

Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors and Tricyclic Antidepressants

Terbutaline sulfate should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents, since the action of terbutaline sulfate on the vascular system may be potentiated.

Hyperkalemia risk factors and prognosis

Prognosis

Potassium homeostasis regulates antiarrhythmic effects, maintenance of diastolic function, vasodilation, and reduction of thrombosis and atherosclerosis. Thus, disturbed potassium homeostasis is associated with a number of adverse events. High potassium levels are associated with myocardial infarction, cardiac hyperexcitability and depression, neuromuscular manifestations (including paresthesia, muscle cramps, and muscle weakness), and gastrointestinal symptoms (including nausea and vomiting). Low potassium levels are also associated with muscle weakness and fatigue, as well as neurologic symptoms (including confusion and affective disorders), smooth muscle dysfunction (including paralytic ileus), arrhythmias and myocardial infarction, and even glucose intolerance. Collectively, the association between serum potassium levels and mortality shows a U-shaped relationship, with increased mortality observed when serum potassium is either high or low. In one analysis in patients with CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2), the pooled adjusted incidence rate ratios for patients with potassium levels < 3.5 and ≥ 6.0 mEq/L were 3.05 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.53–3.68) and 3.31 (95% CI 2.52–4.34), respectively.

Many studies have shown that very high serum potassium levels predispose patients to sudden death. More recently, Kashihara et al. reported that in Japanese patients with CKD Stage 3a with serum potassium ≥ 6.0 mEq/L, the 3-year mortality rate was 22.64%. Hypokalemia (serum potassium < 4.0 mEq/L) has also been reported to correlate with worse prognosis and increased mortality in patients with heart disease, with or without CKD. Specifically, in chronic heart failure patients, hypokalemia increases the risk of death. Furthermore, compared with normokalemia, serum potassium levels < 3.5 mEq/L have been associated with an increased risk of developing atrial fibrillation (hazard ratio (HR) 1.63, 95% CI 1.03–3.56), while levels < 3.0 mEq/L induced a number of proarrhythmic changes, contributing to the occurrence of fatal ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Therefore, clinicians need to be aware of the dangers of both hyperkalemia and hypokalemia.

### Assessment of patiromer monotherapy for hyperkalemia in an acute care setting [^115GDr43]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Study End Points

The primary end point was the mean absolute reduction in serum potassium level from baseline at 3 distinct time intervals after patiromer administration: 0 to 6 hours, greater than 6 to 12 hours, and greater than 12 to 24 hours. These time intervals were prespecified to facilitate analysis in the absence of a standardized, institutional hyperkalemia protocol. Reduction of serum potassium levels was also assessed using relative (percentage) reduction owing to the hypothesized mechanism of more prominent lowering with higher baseline elevation. Outcomes were compared across prespecified subgroups based on care setting, patiromer dose, and baseline hyperkalemia severity stratified as mild (potassium level, 5.1–5.5 mEq/L), moderate (potassium level, 5.6–6.4 mEq/L), or severe (potassium level, ≥ 6.5 mEq/L). Subsequent use of any potassium binder was captured as well as standard-of-care hyperkalemia control measures (eg, calcium, albuterol, regular insulin coadministered with dextrose, and dialysis). Time to a second potassium binder dose and time to insulin dose were assessed. Incidence of hypokalemia, defined as a serum potassium level less than 3.5 mEq/L, and incidence of hypomagnesemia, defined as a serum magnesium level of 1.7 mg/dL or less (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.4114), at 24 hours were recorded. Potassium laboratory test orders and their performance times after the initial patiromer administration were evaluated at intervals of 0 to 6 hours, greater than 6 to 12 hours, and greater than 12 to 24 hours. The time to the earliest recheck and the presence of repeated laboratory tests in each time interval were evaluated to provide insight on potassium monitoring patterns in real-world clinical practice without a treatment protocol.

### Potassium-lowering agents for the treatment of nonemergent hyperkalemia: pharmacology, dosing and comparative efficacy [^113JTAg6]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia represents a common and potentially life-threating electrolyte abnormality, a complication frequently observed in patients with heart failure, kidney disease, diabetes or in those receiving drug therapies influencing the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Elevated serum potassium levels are often the result of impaired urinary potassium elimination, inadequate or reduced cellular potassium uptake, severe heart failure, use of medications influencing potassium levels in the circulation, or, more commonly, a combination of these factors. Strategies for the treatment of nonemergent hyperkalemia include the use of cation-exchange resins, polymers or other novel mechanisms of potassium trapping, including sodium polystyrene sulfonate, patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. These agents differ in their pharmacology and mechanism of action, clinical efficacy, including onset and extent of potassium-lowering effect, dosage and administration, and potential safety and adverse effect profiles. In this review, an evaluation of these characteristics, including clinical evidence and safety concerns, in the management of nonemergent hyperkalemia will be explored.

### Interventions for non-oliguric hyperkalaemia in preterm neonates [^1122GzyP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Non-oliguric hyperkalaemia of the newborn is defined as a plasma potassium level > 6.5 mmol/L in the absence of acute renal failure. Hyperkalaemia is a common complication in the first 48 hours of life in very low birth weight (VLBW) (birth weight < 1500 g) and/or very preterm newborns (≤ 32 weeks gestational age).

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of interventions for non-oliguric hyperkalaemia [for the purpose of this review defined as serum potassium > 6.0 mmol/L (the clinical setting in which interventions would likely be introduced prior to reaching a grossly abnormal level) and urine output > 0.5 ml/kg/hour] in preterm or VLBW infants during their first 72 hours of life.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2006) was searched to identify relevant randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials. The following data bases were searched in June 2006; MEDLINE from 1966, EMBASE from 1980, CINAHL from 1982. Search updated in June 2011.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials conducted in preterm and/or VLBW neonates with a diagnosis of non-oliguric hyperkalaemia. Interventions included were those aimed at redistributing serum potassium (sodium bicarbonate or insulin and glucose) or increasing the elimination of potassium from the body [diuretics (any type) or ion exchange resins (any type), or exchange transfusion, or peritoneal dialysis, or salbutamol, or albuterol] or counteracting potential arrhythmias from hyperkalaemia (calcium) versus placebo or no intervention; or comparing any two of these interventions. Primary outcome measure was 'All cause mortality during initial hospital stay'. Secondary outcomes included common adverse outcomes seen in preterm infants.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard review methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. Two authors assessed all studies identified as potentially relevant by the literature search for inclusion in the review. Statistical methods included relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD), number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) or number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) for dichotomous and weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous outcomes reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used a fixed effect model for meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I squared (I(2)) statistic.

Main Results

Three randomised trials, enrolling 74 preterm infants (outcome data available on 71 infants) evaluated interventions for hyperkalaemia. Urine output was ascertained in only one study (Hu 1999). In none of the trials could we ascertain that allocation to the comparison groups was concealed. The sample sizes of the three trials were very small with 12 (Malone 1991), 19 (Singh 2002) and 40 infants enrolled (Hu 1999). The intervention and the outcome assessments could not be blinded to the clinical staff in two trials (Malone 1991; Hu 1999). One study (Malone 1991), glucose and insulin, compared to cation-exchange resin, caused a reduction in all cause mortality that was of borderline statistical significance: RR 0.18 (95% CI 0.03 to 1.15); RD -0.66 (95% CI -1.09 to -0.22); NNTB 2 (95% CI 1 to 5)]. In the study of Hu (Hu 1999), the incidence of intraventricular haemorrhage ≥ grade 2 was significantly reduced [RR 0.30 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.93); RD -0.35 (95% CI -0.62 to -0.08); NNTB 3 (95% CI 2 to 13). Albuterol inhalation versus saline inhalation changed serum K+ from baseline at four hours [WMD -0.69 mmol/L (95% CI -0.87 to -0.51)] and at eight hours [WMD -0.59 mmol/L (95% CI -0.78 to -0.40)] after initiation of treatment. No differences noted in mortality or other clinical outcomes (Singh 2002). No serious side effects were noted with either the combination of insulin and glucose or albuterol inhalation. Other interventions listed in our objectives have not been studied to date.

Authors' Conclusions

In view of the limited information from small studies of uncertain quality, no firm recommendations for clinical practice can be made. It appears that the combination of insulin and glucose is preferred over treatment with rectal cation-resin for hyperkalaemia in preterm infants. Both the combination of insulin and glucose and albuterol inhalation deserve further study. The two interventions could possibly be tested against each other. The effectiveness of other potentially effective interventions for non-oliguric hyperkalaemia (diuretics, exchange transfusion, peritoneal dialysis and calcium) have not been tested in randomised controlled trials.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^111QJpsS]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hypokalemia:

- **Definition**: Hypokalemia refers to the presence of serum potassium levels < 3.6 mmol/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: Potassium depletion occurs due to inadequate dietary intake, increased renal excretion (e.g., due to diuretic therapy), or increased gastrointestinal losses in the context of diarrhea.
- **Epidemiology**: Hypokalemia is the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in clinical practice.
- **Disease course**: Manifestations of hypokalemia include muscle weakness, ileus, and cardiac arrhythmias. Typical electrocardiographic changes include flat or inverted T waves, ST-segment depression, and prominent U waves.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Severe untreated hypokalemia can lead to rhabdomyolysis and malignant cardiac arrhythmias, such as VT and VF.

### Potassium management with finerenone: practical aspects [^116aq76K]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Although hyperkalemia was increased in both trials, the incidence of hyperkalemia‐related adverse events with clinical impact was low, with hyperkalemia‐related permanent treatment discontinuation in only 1.7% of patients receiving finerenone versus 0.6% with placebo. Potassium intake was not restricted during the trials, but finerenone or placebo was withheld in cases where potassium concentrations > 5.5 mmol/L were detected until potassium concentrations fell to < 5.0 mmol/L. With a robust potassium management strategy guided by regular monitoring of serum potassium, there were no hyperkalemia‐related deaths in more than 13,000 patients over a median follow‐up of 3 years.

### Patiromer for treatment of hyperkalemia in the emergency department: a pilot study [^115g8z66]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperkalemia is common and potentially life threatening. Patiromer is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared oral potassium binder effective in the chronic treatment of hyperkalemia.

Objective

The objective was to investigate the potential efficacy and safety of oral patiromer in treating acute hyperkalemia in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

This is a single-center, randomized, open-label convenience sample pilot study in an inner-city ED. Adult patients with end-stage renal disease and a serum potassium level of ≥ 6.0 mEq/L were randomized to standard of care (SOC) or one dose of 25.2 g oral patiromer plus SOC (PAT). Blood samples and electrocardiograms were collected at enrollment and at 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours thereafter. The primary outcome was the difference in potassium between groups at 6 hours. Secondary outcomes were the amount and number of times insulin and albuterol were given.

Results

Thirty patients were included in the final analysis, 15 in each group. There were no differences in age, sex, or baseline serum potassium. There was no difference in mean serum potassium between SOC and PAT groups at 6 hours (6.32 mEq/L, confidence interval [CI] = 6.0 to 6.63 mEq/L vs. 5.81 mEq/L, CI = 5.48 to 6.14 mEq/L). However, 2 hours posttreatment the serum potassium of the PAT group was lower than SOC group (5.90 mEq/L, CI = 5.63 to 6.17 mEq/L vs. 6.51 mEq/L, CI = 6.25 to 6.78 mEq/L) and also 0.61 mEq/L lower than baseline. There were no differences in the amount or number of administrations of insulin or albuterol between groups, although the amount of albuterol used in the PAT group at 6 hours was lower but not significant (median, 0 mg vs. 12.5 mg; p = 0.097). There were no differences in adverse events between groups.

Conclusion

In this open-label pilot study of severe hyperkalemia, a single dose of 25.2 g of oral patiromer reduced serum potassium within 2 hours but did not show a difference at 6 hours. This is the first study showing that patiromer may have a role in the acute management of hyperkalemia; however, more rigorous studies are needed.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^113hTA5U]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyperkalemia:

- **Definition**: Hyperkalemia is defined as an increase in serum potassium levels > 5.0 mmol/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of hyperkalemia involves disruptions in potassium balance due to excess potassium intake, impaired potassium excretion, or transcellular shifts. The etiology is often multifactorial, with impaired renal function, medication use, and hyperglycemia being the most common contributors.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hyperkalemia in the US is estimated at 1,550 per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: Mild and moderate hyperkalemia are usually asymptomatic. Severe cases may manifest as muscle weakness, ascending paralysis, heart palpitations, and paresthesias. ECG changes associated with hyperkalemia include peaked T waves, P-wave flattening, PR-interval prolongation, widening of the QRS complex, and sine waves.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of hyperkalemia is dependent on the severity of the condition and the promptness of treatment. Severe untreated hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure [^113mdRrN]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Disorders of potassium homeostasis can potentiate the already elevated risk of arrhythmia in heart failure. Heart failure patients have a high prevalence of chronic kidney disease, which further heightens the risk of hyperkalemia, especially when renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors are used. Acute treatment for hyperkalemia may not be tolerated in the long term. Recent data for patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, used to treat and prevent high serum potassium levels on a more chronic basis, have sparked interest in the treatment of hyperkalemia, as well as the potential use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors in patients who were previously unable to take these drugs or tolerated only low doses. This review discusses the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and outcomes of hyperkalemia in heart failure; provides an overview of traditional and novel ways to approach management of hyperkalemia; and discusses the need for further research to optimally treat heart failure.

### Interventions for non-oliguric hyperkalaemia in preterm neonates [^111RbdkA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Non-oliguric hyperkalaemia of the newborn is defined as a plasma potassium level > 6.5 mmol/L in the absence of acute renal failure. Hyperkalaemia is a common complication in the first 48 hours of life in very low birth weight (birth weight < 1500 g) and/or very preterm newborns (< 32 weeks gestational age).

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of interventions for non-oliguric hyperkalaemia [for the purpose of this review defined as serum potassium > 6.0 mmol/L (the clinical setting in which interventions would likely be introduced prior to reaching a grossly abnormal level) and a urine output > 0.5 ml/kg/hour] in preterm or very low birth weight (VLBW) infants during their first 72 hours of life.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2006) was searched to identify relevant randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials. The following data bases were searched in June 2006; MEDLINE from 1966, EMBASE from 1980, CINAHL from 1982.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials conducted in preterm and/or VLBW neonates with a diagnosis of non-oliguric hyperkalaemia. The interventions included were those aimed at redistributing serum potassium (sodium bicarbonate or insulin and glucose) or increasing the elimination of potassium from the body [diuretics (any type) or ion exchange resins (any type), or exchange transfusion, or peritoneal dialysis, or salbutamol, or albuterol] or counteracting potential arrhythmias from hyperkalaemia (calcium) vs. placebo or no intervention; or comparing any two of these interventions. The primary outcome measure was 'All cause mortality during initial hospital stay'. Secondary outcomes included common adverse outcomes seen in infants born preterm.

Data Collection and Analysis

The standard review methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were used. All studies identified as potentially relevant by the literature search were assessed for inclusion in the review by the two authors. The statistical methods included relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD), number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) or number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) for dichotomous and weighed mean difference (WMD) for continuous outcomes reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI). A fixed effects model was used for meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I squared (I(2)) statistic.

Main Results

Three randomized trials, enrolling 74 preterm infants (outcome data available on 71 infants) evaluated interventions for hyperkalemia. Urine output was ascertained only in one study (Hu 1999). In none of the trials could we ascertain that allocation to the comparison groups was concealed. The sample sizes of the three trials were very small with 12 (Malone 1991), 19 (Singh 2002) and 40 infants enrolled (Hu 1999). The intervention and the outcomes assessments could not be blinded to the clinical staff in two trials (Hu 1999; Malone 1991). In one study (Malone 1991), glucose and insulin, compared to cation-exchange resin, caused a reduction in all cause mortality that was of borderline statistical significance: RR 0.18 (95% CI 0.03, 1.15); RD -0.66 (95% CI -1.09, -0.22); NNTB 2 (95% CI 1, 5)]. In the study of Hu (Hu 1999), the incidence of intraventricular haemorrhage > grade 2 was significantly reduced [RR 0.30 (95% CI; 0.10, 0.93); RD -0.35 (95% CI; -0.62, -0.08); NNTB 3 (95% CI; 2, 13). Albuterol inhalation vs. saline inhalation changed serum K+ from baseline at 4 hours [WMD -0.69 mmol/L (95% CI; -0.87, -0.51)] and at 8 hours [WMD -0.59 mmol/L (95% CI; -0.78, -0.40)] after initiation of treatment. No differences were noted in mortality or other clinical outcomes (Singh 2002). No serious side effects were noted with either the combination of insulin and glucose or albuterol inhalation. Other interventions that we listed in our objectives have not been studied to date.

Authors' Conclusions

In view of the limited information from small studies of uncertain quality, no firm recommendations for clinical practice can be made. It appears that the combination of insulin and glucose is preferred over treatment with rectal cation-resin for hyperkalaemia in preterm infants. Both the combination of insulin and glucose and albuterol inhalation deserve further study. The two interventions could possibly be tested against each other. The effectiveness of other potentially effective interventions for non-oliguric hyperkalaemia (diuretics, exchange transfusion, peritoneal dialysis and calcium) have not been tested in randomized controlled trials.

### Minimal effects after a massive intravenous terbutaline overdose in a child [^1118cTPs]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

A 22-kg female in early childhood with a history of reactive airway disease presented to a paediatric emergency department with acute shortness of breath, tachypnoea and wheezing. Despite treatment with albuterol and corticosteroids, her bronchospasm persisted, prompting the administration of terbutaline. The patient received 220 mcg (10 mcg/kg) terbutaline intravenously, followed immediately by an inadvertent supratherapeutic intravenous dose of 10000 mcg (454.5 mcg/kg). The patient's laboratory results obtained minutes after the medication error were notable for: potassium, 3.1mmol/L, lactate, 2.6mmol/L and troponin I, 0.30ng/mL (normal < 0.03ng/mL). Over the next 48 hours, serial serum troponin values decreased. The patient was discharged home approximately 72 hours after the initial presentation and she remained well based on follow-up calls over the next several months. Given the timing and trend of troponin concentrations, we do not believe the terbutaline overdose to be responsible for the myocardial injury.

### Albuterol sulfate (albuterol sulfate HFA) [^114EC9Ki]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.7 Coexisting Conditions

Albuterol Sulfate HFA, like other sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes mellitus and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Large doses of intravenous albuterol have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.

5.8 Hypokalemia

Beta-adrenergic agonist medicines may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring supplementation.

### Updates on medical management of hyperkalemia [^117FVX6D]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hyperkalemia is a potentially fatal electrolyte disorder, more commonly present when the potassium excretion capacity is imparied. Hyperkalemia can lead to adverse outcomes, especially due to severe cardiac arrhythmias. It can also impair the cardiovascular effects of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASis) and potassium rich diets, as hyperkalemia frequently leads to their discontinuation.

Recent Findings

Potassium is a predictor of mortality and should be monitored closely for patients who are at risk for hyperkalemia. Acute hyperkalemia protocols have been revised and updated. Randomized trials have shown that the new anti-hyperkalemic agents (patiromer and zirconium cyclosilicate) are effective hyperkalemia treatment options. The use of anti-hyperkalemic agents may allow for a less restrictive potassium diet and lower RAASi discontinuation rates.

Summary

Hyperkalemia should be monitored closely for high-risk patients, as it is associated with adverse outcomes. New therapies have demonstrated effective control, offering hope for potential use in patients that would benefit from diet or medications associated with an increase in serum potassium, indicating that the use of hyperkalemic agents can be associated with better outcomes.

### Clinical practice guidelines treatment of acute hyperkalaemia in adults [^115onKP5]. UKKA (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hyperkalemia, more specifically with respect to intracellular shifting, insulin/glucose, UKKA 2023 guidelines recommend to consider administering insulin/glucose (10 units soluble insulin in 25 g glucose) by IV infusion for the treatment of moderate hyperkalemia (serum potassium 6.0–6.4 mmol/L).

### The cardiovascular implications of hypokalemia [^116wBXWL]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The role of potassium in the progression of cardiovascular disease is complex and controversial. Animal and human data suggest that increases in dietary potassium, decreases in urinary potassium loss, or increases in serum potassium levels through other mechanisms have benefits in several disease states. These include the treatment of hypertension, stroke prevention, arrhythmia prevention, and treatment of congestive heart failure. Recently, the discovery that aldosterone antagonists not only decrease sodium reabsorption and decrease potassium secretion in the nephron, but also decrease pathological injury of such nonepithelial tissues as the myocardium and endothelium, has generated great controversy regarding the actual mechanisms of benefit of these agents. We review the available data and draw conclusions about the relative benefits of modulating potassium balance versus nonrenal effects of aldosterone blockade in patients with cardiovascular disease.

### Formoterol in clinical practice – safety issues [^1144stZ4]. Respiratory Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

While short-acting beta2-agonists are seen as the cornerstone of treatment as relief medication for asthma, current guidelines recommend long-acting beta2-agonists as maintenance therapy in combination with inhaled corticosteroids in patients with moderate to severe asthma, poorly controlled on present treatment. Although evidence has shown that formoterol, with its fast- and long-acting profile, is effective when used both as regular and as-needed therapy in all types of asthma, there has been some concern about the potential of beta2-agonists with long-acting profiles to produce side effects with a longer duration than seen with short-acting beta2-agonists. Also, where formoterol is used as needed, a higher total daily dose would be anticipated than when taken twice daily for regular maintenance therapy and this again has led to some concern. In a number of studies, formoterol has been shown to be well tolerated, and although systemic effects expected with this class of drugs did occur, formoterol had significantly less effect on serum potassium, pulse, blood pressure, cardiac frequency and QT interval compared with terbutaline. In addition, the duration of effects was equivalent to that observed with terbutaline and salbutamol and the relative therapeutic index of formoterol compared with salbutamol was found to be 2.5. Furthermore, studies looking at long-term use of formoterol have shown there is no reduction in bronchodilatory effect, and thus, no development of tolerance. In conclusion, formoterol is well tolerated in high doses, producing side effects typical of its class, but with a duration no longer than occurs with short-acting beta2-agonists. These observations, and the lack of tolerance development, suggest that formoterol may be appropriate treatment for patients with asthma of all types and severities on an as-needed basis or as regular treatment.

### Rhabdomyolysis: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^1152WALU]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In rhabdomyolysis, electrolyte abnormalities occur as a result of cellular component release associated with induced AKI. Electrolyte abnormalities that occur due to rhabdomyolysis are hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia.

AKI in rhabdomyolysis is often associated with excessive potassium levels and correlates with the volume of muscle destruction. Baseline levels of potassium and all pertinent electrolytes should be evaluated when the possibility of rhabdomyolysis development is present. Hyperkalemia that occurs in rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI occurs early in the course of the disease process and should be monitored closely. Potassium levels should be serially evaluated. Patients with high potassium levels (> 6 mmol/L) should have cardiac monitoring. ECG should be obtained and assessed for manifestations of severe hyperkalemia (QRS widening, small p waves, and severe arrhythmias). Hypocalcemia aggravates the electrical effects of hyperkalemia and should be aggressively treated with calcium chloride or calcium gluconate in this scenario. Elevated potassium levels should be treated with insulin and glucose infusions. Consider administration of a β-2 adrenergic agent such as albuterol via aerosol inhalation. Lastly, consider potassium removal via cation exchange resin or dialysis as indicated.

Similar to hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia occurs as a result of phosphate release from damaged muscle cells. High levels of phosphate may be problematic because phosphate binds to calcium and this complex deposits in the soft tissues. Additionally, by inhibiting 1α-hydroxylase, hyperphosphatemia inhibits calcitriol formation and thus limits formation of the active form of vitamin D. Treatment of hyperphosphatemia should be done with caution since treatment involves administration of a calcium chelator which can increase precipitation of calcium phosphate in injured muscle. Early hyperphosphatemia typically decreases as phosphate is excreted in the urine.

Hypocalcemia occurs early in rhabdomyolysis due to calcium entry into damaged cells and calcium phosphate deposition in necrotic muscle. Early hypocalcemia treatment in rhabdomyolysis should be avoided unless patients are symptomatic or severe hyperkalemia is present. Correction of hypocalcemia with calcium chloride or gluconate should be avoided since calcium deposition may occur in injured muscle. During the recovery phase, serum calcium levels return to normal and may rebound, causing hypercalcemia due to release of calcium from injured muscle and mild secondary hyperparathyroidism secondary to AKI.

Hypermagnesemia seen with rhabdomyolysis is infrequent but when it occurs is typically in association with AKI and should be treated accordingly with hemodialysis.

What is the role of RRT in rhabdomyolysis?

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Recommendations concerning aldosterone antagonists — scope, thresholds, and combination cautions — state that "the addition of low-dose aldosterone antagonists should be considered" in carefully selected patients with moderately severe or severe heart failure or "LV dysfunction early after MI". Trial enrollment generally excluded patients with creatinine "in excess of 2.5 mg per dL", and "few patients were actually enrolled with serum creatinine levels over 1.5 mg per dL"; in the MI trial, the "average serum creatinine" was "1.1 mg per dL, above which there was no demonstrable benefit for survival". To minimize life-threatening hyperkalemia, patients "should have initial serum creatinine less than 2.0 to 2.5 mg per dL" and "serum potassium less than 5.0 mEq per dL". For some with mild to moderate symptoms, "it may be reasonable to consider" adding aldosterone antagonists to loop diuretics, but the committee notes "insufficient data or experience to provide a specific or strong recommendation", and "it is not currently recommended" to give aldosterone antagonists without other concomitant diuretic therapy in chronic HF. Use with both ACEIs and ARBs is cautioned, as "this combination cannot be recommended".

### AARC and PALISI clinical practice guideline: pediatric critical asthma [^117JcTf9]. Respiratory Care (2025). High credibility.

Intravenous short-acting β2 agonists (IV SABA) in pediatric critical asthma — In balance given this evidence, our panel suggests the use of IV SABA in pediatric critical asthma refractory to standard therapies. Implementation details note that Salbutamol, which is only available in IV formulation in some regions, is the most commonly used agent in the studies reviewed; isoproterenol presents another appealing option for IV SABA therapy because of its short half-life and rapid treatment effect; and a more widely utilized IV SABA agent, terbutaline, presents an advantage in its availability but can also result in a profound IV volume load for patients receiving treatment as well as operational hurdles with infusion preparation (limited vial sizes). Additionally, terbutaline and salbutamol have prolonged half-lives compared with the other agents mentioned, requiring bolus dosing for attainment of steady state within infusion as well as with dose escalations, and safety outcomes for all these therapies are not well described, with the incidence and, more importantly, clinical importance of lactic acidosis, hypokalemia, and tachyarrhythmias with all IV SABA treatment remaining an area of ambiguity, especially at low and moderate dosing.

### Elevated potassium levels in patients with congestive heart failure: occurrence, risk factors, and clinical outcomes: a Danish population-based cohort study [^117S2kCF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Additional and Sensitivity Analyses

Although potassium tests were generally frequent in the HF cohort (mean, 23 tests; median, 15 tests; interquartile range, 5–31 tests per patient during the observation period), bias by indication for blood testing may be a concern (ie, sicker patients possibly receiving more frequent blood testing with higher likelihood of hyperkalemia being detected). Therefore, the analyses were repeated using a randomly selected set of 5 potassium tests per patient among patients with HF with at least 5 tests the year after HF. Second, to study hyperkalemia impact in a subcohort more likely to have chronic HF, and thus be more closely followed up, patients who were alive at 6 months after HF discharge had an echocardiography performed and were treated with both ARBs or ACEis and β blocker up to this date were separately examined. Third, as an alternative method to account for remaining unmeasured confounding when comparing outcomes in patients with and without hyperkalemia with HF, the ratio of the 2 matched HRs observed after versus before the hyperkalemia/index date (ie, the prior event rate ratio adjusted rate ratio) was estimated. 23 This method is based on the assumption that differences in outcomes between hyperkalemia‐exposed and matched hyperkalemia‐unexposed patients present already before experiencing hyperkalemia reflect the combined effect of remaining unmeasured confounders, independent of any effect of hyperkalemia. Fourth, to exclude reverse causality (ie, acute‐care hospitalization outcomes, such as intensive care unit admission, leading to secondary hyperkalemia, versus being a consequence of hyperkalemia), outcomes were also examined separately for hyperkalemia detected on the first admission date of any hospitalization. Fifth, analyses were stratified by initial HF diagnosis being primary (first‐listed) versus secondary diagnosis. Sixth, we evaluated outcomes separately for elevated potassium detected on dates on which patients were hospitalized versus out of hospital, and we repeated the outcome analyses separately in patients with < 10 potassium tests versus patients with ≥ 10 tests before the hyperkalemia event. Finally, the influence of potential unmeasured confounding was quantified by means of a rule‐out approach. 24 We estimated how strongly an unmeasured binary confounder would need to be associated with hyperkalemia and outcomes to fully explain our findings, and we illustrated this association graphically.

The study was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency. The study was purely registry based and did not involve any contact with patients or interventions; therefore, according to Danish legislation, no informed consent was required.

Clinical Approach for Monitoring

First, appropriate monitoring of patients at the initiation and shortly after the commencement of therapy with RAASi is critical. Careful monitoring and cautious dose adjustment are absolutely essential to successfully maintain high‐risk patients on maximal RAASi therapy.

Before starting or changing RAASi dose, it is necessary to completely review prescribed (eg, trimethoprim or β‐blockers, both shown to increase serum potassium) and over‐the‐counter medications (such as nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory agents), in addition to assessing intravascular volume status. Having an accurate assessment of the patient's ideal weight is helpful in this regard. Patients significantly lower than their target body weight may already be sodium avid and not provide the distal sodium delivery needed to support potassium excretion. Patients who are significantly greater than their target body weight may have cardiac decompensation, which will reduce renal blood flow, activate the RAAS, and reduce distal sodium delivery. It is important to avoid starting or increasing RAASi dose until patients are optimized with regard to intravascular volume, with stable kidney function, and when other medications that increase serum potassium have been stopped or reduced as much as possible. Clearly starting RAASi in the setting of hyperkalemia is not advisable. Repeat laboratory testing 10 to 14 days after delaying or after starting or changing RAASi dose is important and should include close monitoring once a stable RAASi dose is achieved. The intervals for monitoring should be tailored to the patient's history and comorbidities but at a minimum at least every 4 months.

### Effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on potassium levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a pooled analysis [^113JwUf2]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hyperkalemia, defined as a serum potassium level of greater than 5.5 mmol/L, is a potentially life-threatening condition that causes increased cardiac depolarization and can lead to rapid electrocardiographic changes and an increased risk of arrhythmias. Conversely, hypokalemia is defined as a serum potassium level of less than 3.5 mmol/L (mild) or less than 2.5 mmol/L (severe) and can lead to an increase in the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. In addition to the risk associated with serum potassium outside the normal range (i.e. below or above normal levels), maintaining stable serum potassium values within physiological levels is important, as high serum potassium fluctuations are associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

Patients with diabetes are at increased risk of hyperkalemia and diabetes is an independent risk factor for hyperkalemia. In an outpatient population of patients with diabetes, the prevalence of hyperkalemia has been estimated at 4%, whereas in a separate investigation in the general population, it has been estimated to be lower (0.3%). Additionally, diabetes is associated with a high incidence of renal impairment, which in turn is an independent risk factor for hyperkalemia.

Antihypertensive medications, which are frequently prescribed to these patients, can also increase serum potassium. For example, medications that reduce renal potassium excretion by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system [such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)], and drugs that inhibit the epithelial sodium channel (known as potassium-sparing diuretics) are associated with a greater hyperkalemia risk. The combination of an ACE inhibitor or ARB and a potassium-sparing diuretic is likely to further increase potassium levels and has been shown to precipitate life-threatening hyperkalemia in patients with diabetes. Conversely, other diuretics such as thiazides or loop diuretics are generally associated with an increased risk of hypokalemia.

Older patients with diabetes have an increased susceptibility to hyperkalemia due to a number of factors, including an age-related decline in renal function and pharmaceutical side effects, such as those associated with ACE inhibitor or ARB treatment.

### Safety of formoterol by turbuhaler as reliever medication compared with terbutaline in moderate asthma [^117Y7m5u]. The European Respiratory Journal (2002). Low credibility.

The present study compared the safety of 4.5 microg formoterol with 0.5 mg terbutaline, both by Turbuhaler and used as needed, in addition to regular formoterol in moderate asthma. In this double-blind parallel-group study, 357 patients taking a moderate-to-high dose of inhaled corticosteroids and additional terbutaline (2–5 inhalations x day(-1) during run-in) were randomised to either formoterol or terbutaline as needed in addition to formoterol 9 microg b.i.d. over 12 weeks. Adverse events, serum potassium levels, electrocardiogram, vital signs and lung function were assessed monthly; peak expiratory flow and severe asthma exacerbations were recorded daily. Patients used 2.16 (range 0.0–6.3) formoterol and 2.34 (range 0.1–7.5) terbutaline relief inhalations x day(-1). No clinically significant differences in safety variables were found between treatments. Statistically greater increases in cardiac frequency (2.6 beats x min(-1), p = 0.03) were found on terbutaline. There were 44 and 52 severe asthma exacerbations with formoterol and terbutaline, respectively, with no significant difference in time to first exacerbation. There was also no difference between treatments for other efficacy measures (peak expiratory flow, forced expiratory volume in one second and morning/evening symptom scores). Formoterol 4.5 microg as needed was at least as safe, well tolerated and effective as terbutaline 0.5 mg in stable patients (requiring up to 6 relief inhalations x day(-1)) taking formoterol plus inhaled corticosteroids regularly over 12 weeks.

### Patiromer induces rapid and sustained potassium lowering in patients with chronic kidney disease and hyperkalemia [^117RmYZy]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Whether potassium would have decreased more rapidly or to a greater extent with a larger initial dose of patiromer or a different dosing regimen (e.g. 3 times daily dosing) cannot be determined from the data presented here. In the current study, the dose of patiromer was not titrated to the level of serum potassium. The total daily dose was lower than the mean 21.4 g daily that was used over the first 4 weeks in the phase 3 study in patients with moderate-to-severe hyperkalemia. Whether patiromer, as an adjunct to conventional therapy, will help lower potassium more rapidly in the emergency setting of acute life-threatening hyperkalemia remains to be evaluated.

Limitations of the study include the lack of a placebo control. All patients in this study had sustained, significantly elevated serum potassium levels (⩾5.5 mEq/l) for 3 days before the initiation of patiromer treatment. The significant reductions in serum potassium in this study are unlikely to have occurred without patiromer, given the stability of serum potassium values observed during the potassium- and sodium-restricted dietary run-in phase leading up to study qualification and enrollment, the use of a separate blood sample for assessment of baseline serum potassium, and the significant increase in serum potassium at ~86 and 158 h after the last dose of patiromer. The use of an active control such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate, the only drug specifically indicated for the treatment of hyperkalemia in the United States, was also considered but was felt to be inappropriate because of the lack of prospective, controlled trials demonstrating the efficacy of this agent, its potential to cause intestinal necrosis as detailed in the prescribing information, and its poor gastrointestinal tolerability making blinding difficult.,

In conclusion, patiromer induced an early and a sustained, clinically significant reduction in serum potassium in moderately and severely hyperkalemic patients with CKD who were taking RAASis. After the first significant decrease in mean serum potassium at 7 h, mean serum potassium levels continued to decrease, never increasing before the next dose or for 24 h after the last dose of patiromer. Patiromer did not induce hypokalemia, and it was well tolerated.

### Patiromer induces rapid and sustained potassium lowering in patients with chronic kidney disease and hyperkalemia [^111KjQ9f]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Patiromer has previously been reported to safely and effectively lower serum potassium and maintain normokalemia in several controlled trials, involving a total of 603 patients on active treatment. The need for chronic therapy with patiromer was demonstrated by the significant increase in serum potassium after discontinuation of patiromer in the AMETHYST-DN study. In the current study, a significant increase in mean serum potassium 4 and 7 days after the last dose of patiromer was also observed.

The strength of the efficacy findings derives from the study's rigorous design, including the inpatient treatment phase and enrollment of patients with persistent hyperkalemia while on a stable, potassium- and sodium-restricted diet. These design elements are optimal for determining the early onset effects of a drug on serum potassium. The 3-day run-in ensured the identification of patients with chronic or persistent hyperkalemia and also that patients with spurious (i.e. due to hemolysis), transient, and/or postprandial hyperkalemia were excluded. In addition, as serum potassium may vary secondary to diurnal variationand fasting/feeding cycles, serum potassium was recorded at prespecified intervals for 72 h, in the run-in period designed to confirm chronic hyperkalemia, reduce serum potassium variation, and establish a stable baseline serum potassium before treatment with patiromer.

### A randomized study to compare oral potassium binders in the treatment of acute hyperkalemia [^11677WRR]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Study procedures

Non-ICU and ER patients are screened remotely by research staff using the Epic Medical Records system to identify potential study candidates. Patients with a qualifying blood K + level (≥ 5.5 mEq/L) are then screened for the inclusion and exclusion criteria (Table 3). Temporizing therapies for acute hyperkalemia (e.g. insulin/dextrose, IV fluids/loop diuretic or albuterol) will be administered per discretion of the attending physician regardless of enrollment status.

A physician listed on the consent form will perform a final criteria review and obtain signed informed consent. These study investigators include hospitalists, ER physicians, and nephrologists. To ensure that the patient and primary treating provider are blinded to the study drug, a nephrologist (WLL) will order the study drug that is dispensed by the Investigational Drug Services Pharmacy. The nurse dispending the study drug is advised not to disclose name of study drug to the participant.

Blood chemistries including basic metabolic panel, Mg 2+ and phosphorus are drawn at 2 and 4 h following administration of the study drug. Participants complete a Symptom Assessment form and report a Palatability Score at 4 h following the medication dose (Supplementary Materials). If the 4-h blood K + remains elevated ≥ 5.5 mEq/L then the primary hospital team will be notified for further hyperkalemia management per their discretion. Data on participant demographics, home and hospital-administered medications, comorbid conditions, lab parameters, and length of ER/hospital stay from chart review will be compiled in a secure REDCap database. Study procedures are summarized in Fig. 2.

### Potassium bicarbonate (effer-K) [^114uuScR]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Warnings

In patients with hyperkalemia and impaired mechanisms for excreting potassium the administration of potassium salts can produce hyperkalemia and cardiac arrest. This occurs most commonly in patients given potassium by the intravenous route but may also occur in patients given potassium orally. Potentially fatal hyperkalemia can develop rapidly and be asymptomatic.

The use of potassium salts in patients with chronic renal disease, or any other condition which impairs potassium excretion, requires particularly careful monitoring of the serum potassium concentration and appropriate dosage adjustment.

Note: There is no conclusive evidence that potassium supplements lower blood pressure in hypertensive patients.

### Treating interdialytic hyperkalemia with fludrocortisone [^115TZDdT]. Seminars in Dialysis (2003). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a frequent and dangerous problem in dialysis patients. Many factors contribute to potentially life-threatening potassium elevation and most remedies used to treat hyperkalemia are handicapped by the consequences of the separate pools of intra- and extracellular potassium. Besides the kidney, the colon has the ability to excrete potassium, which can help lower total body potassium. Several prior authors have addressed the colon's ability to up-regulate potassium secretion, including the effect of aldosterone on fecal potassium content. Potentially dangerous intradialytic maneuvers to lower potassium levels may be avoidable with the use of the mineralocorticoid agonist fludrocortisone.

### Generalized myasthenia gravis with acetylcholine receptor antibodies: a guidance for treatment [^113vZgVy]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Symptomatic drug treatment

Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors

Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are recommended as first‐line treatment in MG as they increase the amount of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, thus improving neuromuscular transmission. Pyridostigmine bromide is the primary drug of choice. Ambenonium chloride is usually less effective and is regarded as a second‐line acetylcholine esterase inhibitor.

Pyridostigmine dosage is titrated individually, where 30–60 mg every 4–6 h is a typical adult dose. In pediatric patients, titration starts from 1 mg/kg/day, and a typical dose is 7 mg/kg/day. A daily dose of 450–600 mg or more may cause increased muscle weakness and cholinergic crisis.

Side effects are mainly due to muscarinic adverse events, including stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, muscle cramps, increased sweating, bronchial secretions, hypotension, and bradycardia. In a Dutch–Belgian cohort, 91% reported side effects from pyridostigmine, and one in four discontinued the treatment mainly due to side effects. Atropine in a low dose can be temporarily used to counteract such side effects, which are typically most pronounced at the start of the therapy. Pyridostigmine should not be given in the case of gastrointestinal or urinary obstruction and should be used cautiously in patients with bronchial asthma, bradyarrhythmias, or recent coronary occlusion. Pyridostigmine affects sensitivity to non‐depolarizing muscle relaxants such as vecuronium bromide.

Beta‐2 adrenergic agonists

Beta adrenergic agonists represent first‐line treatment for most congenital myasthenic syndromes but may also have a role in acquired MG. Beta‐2 adrenergic receptor agonists in low doses, mainly terbutaline, ameliorate the clinical symptoms in MG. A randomized, placebo‐controlled, pilot study of terbutaline improved the quantitative MG score and the fatigue response on repetitive nerve stimulation. Beta‐2 adrenergic agonists should be given with caution to patients with severe cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled hyperthyroidism, or hypokalemia.

Recommendations

Pyridostigmine in optimal dose should be given as a first‐line symptomatic treatment in most patients with MG.
The optimal dose can vary according to activity needs and be adjusted by the patient accordingly.
Terbutaline and salbutamol can be used as adjuvant symptomatic treatments.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA Practice Guidelines — general measures for patients with current or prior symptoms of heart failure: Moderate sodium restriction with daily weight measurement is indicated to permit effective use of diuretic drugs, and immunization with influenza and pneumococcal vaccines may reduce respiratory infection risk; physical activity should be encouraged except during acute exacerbations or suspected myocarditis. Three classes of drugs can exacerbate HF and should be avoided in most patients — antiarrhythmic agents (with only amiodarone and dofetilide shown not to adversely affect survival), calcium channel blockers (with only the vasoselective ones shown not to adversely affect survival), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which can cause sodium retention, peripheral vasoconstriction, and attenuate the efficacy and enhance the toxicity of diuretics and ACEIs. Patients with HF should be monitored carefully for changes in serum potassium, every effort should be made to prevent hypokalemia or hyperkalemia, and many experts believe serum potassium concentrations should be targeted in the 4.0 to 5.0 mmol per liter range; in some patients deficits may require supplementation of magnesium and potassium, whereas in others (particularly those taking ACEIs alone or with aldosterone antagonists) routine potassium salts may be unnecessary and potentially deleterious. Patient education and close supervision, including surveillance by the patient and family, can reduce nonadherence and enable early detection of changes in body weight or clinical status to allow treatments that can prevent clinical deterioration.

### Patiromer in patients with kidney disease and hyperkalemia receiving RAAS inhibitors [^115rvucP]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Hyperkalemia increases the risk of death and limits the use of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in high-risk patients. We assessed the safety and efficacy of patiromer, a nonabsorbed potassium binder, in a multicenter, prospective trial.

Methods

Patients with chronic kidney disease who were receiving RAAS inhibitors and who had serum potassium levels of 5.1 to less than 6.5 mmol per liter received patiromer (at an initial dose of 4.2 g or 8.4 g twice a day) for 4 weeks (initial treatment phase); the primary efficacy end point was the mean change in the serum potassium level from baseline to week 4. Eligible patients at the end of week 4 (those with a baseline potassium level of 5.5 to < 6.5 mmol per liter in whom the level decreased to 3.8 to < 5.1 mmol per liter) entered an 8-week randomized withdrawal phase in which they were randomly assigned to continue patiromer or switch to placebo; the primary efficacy end point was the between-group difference in the median change in the serum potassium level over the first 4 weeks of that phase.

Results

In the initial treatment phase, among 237 patients receiving patiromer who had at least one potassium measurement at a scheduled visit after day 3, the mean (± SE) change in the serum potassium level was -1.01 ± 0.03 mmol per liter (P < 0.001). At week 4, 76% (95% confidence interval, 70 to 81) of the patients had reached the target potassium level (3.8 to < 5.1 mmol per liter). Subsequently, 107 patients were randomly assigned to patiromer (55 patients) or placebo (52 patients) for the randomized withdrawal phase. The median increase in the potassium level from baseline of that phase was greater with placebo than with patiromer (P < 0.001); a recurrence of hyperkalemia (potassium level, ≥ 5.5 mmol per liter) occurred in 60% of the patients in the placebo group as compared with 15% in the patiromer group through week 8 (P < 0.001). Mild-to-moderate constipation was the most common adverse event (in 11% of the patients); hypokalemia occurred in 3%.

Conclusions

In patients with chronic kidney disease who were receiving RAAS inhibitors and who had hyperkalemia, patiromer treatment was associated with a decrease in serum potassium levels and, as compared with placebo, a reduction in the recurrence of hyperkalemia.

### Pathophysiology and management of hypokalemia: a clinical perspective [^112zAvMR]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

Potassium (K(+)) ions are the predominant intracellular cations. K(+) homeostasis depends on external balance (dietary intake [typically 100 mmol per day] versus excretion [95% via the kidney; 5% via the colon]) and internal balance (the distribution of K(+) between intracellular and extracellular fluid compartments). The uneven distribution of K(+) across cell membranes means that a mere 1% shift in its distribution can cause a 50% change in plasma K(+) concentration. Hormonal mechanisms (involving insulin, β-adrenergic agonists and aldosterone) modulate K(+) distribution by promoting rapid transfer of K(+) across the plasma membrane. Extrarenal K(+) losses from the body are usually small, but can be marked in individuals with chronic diarrhea, severe burns or prolonged sweating. Under normal circumstances, the kidney's distal nephron secretes K(+) and determines final urinary excretion. In patients with hypokalemia (plasma K(+) concentration < 3.5 mmol/l), after the exclusion of extrarenal causes, alterations in sodium ion delivery to the distal nephron, mineralocorticoid status, or a specific inherited or acquired defect in distal nephron function (each of which affects distal nephron K(+) secretion), should be considered. Clinical management of hypokalemia should establish the underlying cause and alleviate the primary disorder. This Review aims to inform clinicians about the pathophysiology and appropriate treatment for hypokalemia.

### Potassium homeostasis and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors [^1155wSxQ]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a key strategy in treating hypertension and cardiovascular and renal diseases. However, RAAS inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, aldosterone receptor antagonists, and direct renin inhibitors) increase the risk of hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.5 mmol/L). This review evaluates the effects on serum potassium levels of RAAS inhibitors. Using PubMed, we searched for clinical trials published up to December 2008 assessing the effects on serum potassium levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, aldosterone receptor antagonists, and direct renin inhibitors, alone and in combination, in patients with hypertension, heart failure (HF), or chronic kidney disease (CKD); 39 studies were identified. In patients with hypertension without risk factors for hyperkalemia, the incidence of hyperkalemia with RAAS inhibitor monotherapy is low (≤ 2%), whereas rates are higher with dual RAAS inhibition (approximately 5%). The incidence of hyperkalemia is also increased in patients with HF or CKD (5% to 10%). However, increases in serum potassium levels are small (approximately 0.1 to 0.3 mmol/L), and rates of study discontinuation due to hyperkalemia are low, even in high-risk patient groups (1% to 5%). Patients with HF or CKD are at greater risk of hyperkalemia with RAAS inhibitors than those without these conditions. However, the absolute changes in serum potassium are generally small and unlikely to be clinically significant. Moreover, these patients are likely to derive benefit from RAAS inhibition. Rather than denying them an effective treatment, electrolyte levels should be closely monitored in these patients.

### Derangements of potassium [^115kCKyH]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Changes in potassium elimination, primarily due to the renal and GI systems, and shifting potassium between the intracellular and extracellular spaces cause potassium derangement. Symptoms are vague, but can be cardiac, musculoskeletal, or gastrointestinal. There are no absolute guidelines for when to treat, but it is generally recommended when the patient is symptomatic or has ECG changes. Treatment of hyperkalemia includes cardiac membrane stabilization with IV calcium, insulin and beta-antagonists to push potassium intracellularly, and dialysis. Neither sodium bicarbonate nor kayexelate are recommended. Treatment of symptomatic hypokalemia consists of PO or IV repletion with potassium chloride and magnesium sulfate.

Aldosterone antagonist therapy — hyperkalemia risk minimization: Impaired renal function is a risk factor for hyperkalemia during treatment with aldosterone antagonists, and risk increases when serum creatinine exceeds 1.6 mg per dL; in patients in whom creatinine may not reflect filtration, determination that glomerular filtration rate or creatinine clearance exceeds 30 mL per min is recommended. Aldosterone antagonists should not be administered to patients with baseline serum potassium in excess of 5.0 mEq per liter. An initial dose of spironolactone 12.5 mg or eplerenone 25 mg is recommended, with possible increase to spironolactone 25 mg or eplerenone 50 mg as appropriate. The risk of hyperkalemia is increased with concomitant higher doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) (captopril greater than or equal to 75 mg daily; enalapril or lisinopril greater than or equal to 10 mg daily); nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors should be avoided, and potassium supplements should be discontinued or reduced. Close monitoring is required: potassium levels and renal function should be checked in 3 days and at 1 week after initiation of therapy and at least monthly for the first 3 months, and diarrhea or other causes of dehydration should be addressed emergently. Although trial entry allowed creatinine greater than 2.5 mg per dL, in 1 trial 95% of patients had creatinine less than or equal to 1.7 mg per dL, indicating most studied patients had better renal function than the entry limit.

Angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy — initiation, monitoring, titration, and combination risks — should include reassessment of blood pressure, renal function, and potassium "within 1 to 2 weeks" after starting, with closer follow-up after dose changes; patients with "systolic blood pressure below 80 mm Hg" warrant particular surveillance. Titration "is generally achieved by doubling doses", and "for stable patients, it is reasonable to add therapy with beta-blocking agents before full target doses of either ACEIs or ARBs are reached". Risks of "hypotension, renal dysfunction, and hyperkalemia are greater when combined with another inhibitor of this axis, such as ACEIs or aldosterone antagonists".

### Is transcellular potassium shifting with insulin, albuterol, or sodium bicarbonate in emergency department patients with hyperkalemia associated with recurrent hyperkalemia after dialysis? [^117KiXwF]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Emergency department (ED) treatment of hyperkalemia often involves shifting potassium into the intracellular space. There is uncertainty whether transcellular shifting causes insufficient potassium removal during hemodialysis, resulting in a subsequent need for further medical therapy or multiple sessions of hemodialysis.

Objective

We sought to determine whether transcellular potassium shifting in ED patients with hyperkalemia who undergo hemodialysis is associated with recurrent hyperkalemia with or without repeat hemodialysis within 24 h.

Methods

This was a retrospective observational study of ED patients with a potassium value > 5.3 mmol/L and ≥ 1 hemodialysis run. Transcellular shifting medications were defined as albuterol, insulin, and sodium bicarbonate. Primary outcomes were recurrent hyperkalemia with and without repeat hemodialysis within 24 h of the initial dialysis run. Generalized estimating equation models were created for the outcomes using administration of a shifting medication as the primary predictor.

Results

Four hundred seventy-nine encounters were identified. In 238 (50%) encounters, a shifting medication was administered. There were 85 outcomes of recurrent hyperkalemia and 36 outcomes of recurrent hyperkalemia with repeat hemodialysis. After adjustment, administration of shifting medications was not associated with recurrent hyperkalemia (adjusted odds ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval 0.71–2.23) or recurrent hyperkalemia with repeat dialysis (adjusted odds ratio 1.90, 95% confidence interval 0.80–4.48).

Conclusions

Administration of transcellular shifting medications for hyperkalemia in the ED was not associated with either recurrent hyperkalemia after hemodialysis or the need for a second dialysis session within 24 h. Our findings address the uncertainty regarding transcellular potassium shifting before emergent dialysis and support safe ED administration of medications that shift potassium to the intracellular space.

### Dispelling myths and misconceptions about the treatment of acute hyperkalemia [^111gKdBN]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia represents a widespread and potentially lethal condition that affects millions of people across their lives. Despite the prevalence and severity of the condition, there are no consensus guidelines on the treatment of hyperkalemia or even a standard definition. Herein, we provide a succinct review of what we believe to be the most significant misconceptions encountered in the emergency care of hyperkalemia, examine current available literature, and discuss practical points on several modalities of hyperkalemia treatment. Additionally, we review the pathophysiology of the electrocardiographic effects of hyperkalemia and how intravenous calcium preparations can antagonize these effects. We conclude each section with recommendations to aid emergency physicians in making safe and efficacious choices for the treatment of acute hyperkalemia.

### The use of β ₂-agonist therapy before hospital attendance for severe asthma exacerbations: a post-hoc analysis [^1152ykDY]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

We were concerned that the higher intrinsic activity of formoterol compared with salbutamol could potentially lead to greater hypokalaemic and cardiovascular effects. However, patients in the SMART group did not have lower serum potassium levels, presumably because of the markedly lower doses of budesonide/formoterol taken compared with salbutamol. The observation that only one patient had a serum potassium level below the lower limit of the normal range, despite such high β 2 -agonist doses, indicates that substantive tolerance to the systemic β 2 effects occurs. Unfortunately, too few patients had an electrocardiogram at presentation to hospital to investigate the relative effects on QTc interval.

Documentation in hospital medical records under-reported the extent of β 2 -agonist overuse leading up to the hospital presentation. This observation probably reflects both under-reporting by patients and the lack of recognition of the importance of accurate determination and documentation of this feature of the history by the attending medical staff. The clinical importance of this is illustrated by the three patients, each of whom used at least 95 salbutamol actuations in the 48 h before attendance, and who were subsequently discharged from the ED on the day of their presentation. Our findings of very high doses of self-administered β 2 -agonist, in the form of salbutamol or formoterol, are consistent with a prior study demonstrating high blood salbutamol concentrations in patients dying of asthma.

Management of HyperPP

Acute Management

Acute management may include mild exercise at attack onset and a carbohydrate snack. Beta agonists can be an effective acute potassium‐lowering therapy for HyperPP. 1 In case reports, salbutamol 1–2 puffs (0.1 mg) and other beta‐agonists have shown benefits. 62, 63, 64 While severe hyperkalemia during attacks is typically not seen, the treatment for acute hyperkalemia which is severe or life‐threatening should match institutions' established protocols.

Prevention

In individuals with HyperPP, consider recommending consumption of multiple small carbohydrate snacks and avoid potassium‐rich foods. 10

Dichlorphenamide can be effective for chronic treatment and is approved for HyperPP. 22, 53 In randomized, placebo‐controlled studies, dichlorphenamide reduced attack frequency and severity among patients. 22, 53 The initial dose is 50 mg twice daily, which may be increased or decreased at weekly intervals based on individual response or the occurrence of adverse events. The maximum recommended dose is 200 mg daily. 22, 53 Acetazolamide 125–1000 mg/day may be effective for chronic treatment of HyperPP. 15, 23

Thiazide diuretics are an option for chronic treatment of HyperPP. 1, 42 The drug of choice is hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg to 75 mg daily. 41, 54 Potassium‐sparing diuretics should be avoided.

There are no rigorously controlled data on the treatment of PMC, normokalemic PP, and other atypical PPs, but in general, the same treatment strategies used for HyperPP are appropriate.

Management of Andersen‐Tawil Syndrome

Management of individuals with Andersen‐Tawil syndrome requires the coordinated input of a neurologist familiar with the treatment of periodic paralysis and a cardiologist familiar with the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. Treatment for acute attacks of weakness or for chronic suppression of attacks of weakness in individuals with Andersen‐Tawil syndrome depends on whether the attack is associated with high or low levels of potassium, and treatment needs to be individualized for each patient (see sections above for HypoPP and HyperPP for specific recommendations). 10 Evaluations recommended to establish the extent of disease and needs in a patient diagnosed with Andersen‐Tawil syndrome are summarized in Table 6. 65 For asymptomatic patients with a KCNJ2 mutation, annual screening should include a 12‐lead ECG and 24‐h Holter monitoring.

### Amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide [^11334Z7H]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia

Like other potassium-conserving diuretic combinations, amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide may cause hyperkalemia (serum potassium levels greater than 5.5 mEq per liter). In patients without renal impairment or diabetes mellitus, the risk of hyperkalemia with this combination product is about 1 to 2 percent. This risk is higher in patients with renal impairment or diabetes mellitus (even without recognized diabetic nephropathy). Since hyperkalemia, if uncorrected, is potentially fatal, it is essential to monitor serum potassium levels carefully in any patient receiving amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide, particularly when it is first introduced, at the time of dosage adjustments, and during any illness that could affect renal function.

The risk of hyperkalemia may be increased when potassium-conserving agents, including amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide, are administered concomitantly with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, cylosporine or tacrolimus (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Warning signs or symptoms of hyperkalemia include paresthesias, muscular weakness, fatigue, flaccid paralysis of the extremities, bradycardia, shock, and ECG abnormalities. Monitoring of the serum potassium level is essential because mild hyperkalemia is not usually associated with an abnormal ECG.

When abnormal, the ECG in hyperkalemia is characterized primarily by tall, peaked T waves or elevations from previous tracings. There may also be lowering of the R wave and increased depth of the S wave, widening and even disappearance of the P wave, progressive widening of the QRS complex, prolongation of the PR interval, and ST depression.

Treatment of Hyperkalemia

If hyperkalemia occurs in patients taking amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide, the drug should be discontinued immediately. If the serum potassium level exceeds 6.5 mEq per liter, active measures should be taken to reduce it. Such measures include the intravenous administration of sodium bicarbonate solution or oral or parenteral glucose with a rapid-acting insulin preparation. If needed, a cation exchange resin such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate may be given orally or by enema. Patients with persistent hyperkalemia may require dialysis.

### The utility of the transtubular potassium gradient in the evaluation of hyperkalemia [^115TF8pY]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

The transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG) is used to gauge renal potassium secretion by the cortical collecting duct, indirectly assessing mineralocorticoid bioactivity in patients who have hypo- or hyperkalemia. TTKG values < 6 indicate an inappropriate renal response to hyperkalemia, whereas values > 2 during hypokalemia point to renal loss. Hypokalemia is not addressed here. Studies supporting the usefulness of the TTKG in hyperkalemia are limited to case series. This calculation may be most useful in distinguishing hyperkalemic patients who have mineralocorticoid deficiency versus resistance by observing a change in TTKG values after physiologic or pharmacologic doses of mineralocorticoids.

### Clinical practice guidelines treatment of acute hyperkalaemia in adults [^113ZgJQ7]. UKKA (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hyperkalemia, more specifically with respect to intracellular shifting, insulin/glucose, UKKA 2023 guidelines recommend to administer infusion of 10% glucose at a rate of 50 mL/hour for 5 hours (25 g) following insulin/glucose treatment in patients with a pretreatment blood glucose < 7.0 mmol/L to avoid hypoglycemia.

### A randomized study to compare oral potassium binders in the treatment of acute hyperkalemia [^1166cBtN]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

Baseline characteristics between the four groups will be compared using Chi-square test for categorical variables or ANOVA with contrasts and Kruskal-Wallis test (non-parametric) for continuous variables. Variables of interest include acute kidney injury, CKD or chronic dialysis status; diabetes mellitus; congestive heart failure; RAAS inhibitor medication prescription; metabolic acidosis; and concurrent therapies for hyperkalemia (insulin/dextrose, diuretics, albuterol, bicarbonate).

Linear mixed effects models will be used to compare mean change in blood K + from baseline between the four groups at 2 and 4 h, and next morning K + (P set at 0.05). Multivariate adjustment will be done for kidney function, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, metabolic acidosis, RAAS inhibitor prescription, and treatment with temporizing agents (insulin, albuterol, loop diuretics). For next morning K + values, multivariate adjustment will include any hyperkalemia treatments that were done after the 4-h study protocol (including dialysis). A Cox proportional hazards model will be used to analyze the association between type of oral potassium binder and length of ER or hospital stay.

Safety and tolerability will be assessed using a Kruskal-Wallis test to globally test for a negative trend across all 4 study treatments (two-sided P < 0.05) and, if significant, further testing will be done using a two-sided Fisher Exact test compare each potassium binder vs. the nonspecific laxative control.

### Levalbuterol [^117EKuwk]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

7.1 Short-Acting Bronchodilators

Avoid concomitant use of other short-acting sympathomimetic bronchodilators or epinephrine in patients being treated with levalbuterol inhalation solution. If additional adrenergic drugs are to be administered by any route, they should be used with caution to avoid deleterious cardiovascular effects.

7.2 Beta-blockers

Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-adrenergic agonists such as levalbuterol inhalation solution, but may produce severe bronchospasm in asthmatic patients. Therefore, patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, e.g., prophylaxis after myocardial infarction, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in patients with asthma. In this setting, cardioselective beta-blockers should be considered, although they should be administered with caution.

7.3 Diuretics

The ECG changes or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non-potassium-sparing diuretics (such as loop and thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the coadministration of beta-agonists with non-potassium-sparing diuretics. Consider monitoring potassium levels.

7.4 Digoxin

Mean decreases of 16% and 22% in serum digoxin levels were demonstrated after single-dose intravenous and oral administration of racemic albuterol, respectively, to normal volunteers who had received digoxin for 10 days. The clinical significance of these findings for patients with obstructive airway disease who are receiving levalbuterol inhalation solution and digoxin on a chronic basis is unclear. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to carefully evaluate the serum digoxin levels in patients who are currently receiving digoxin and levalbuterol inhalation solution.

7.5 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors or Tricyclic Antidepressants

Levalbuterol inhalation solution should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents, because the action of levalbuterol on the vascular system may be potentiated. Consider alternative therapy in patients taking MAO inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants.

### Potassium bicarbonate (effer-K) [^112Mt8NF]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Overdosage

The administration of oral potassium salts to persons with normal excretory mechanisms for potassium rarely causes serious hyperkalemia. However, if excretory mechanisms are impaired or if potassium is administered too rapidly intravenously, potentially fatal hyperkalemia can result (see Contraindications and Warnings). It is important to recognize that initally hyperkalemia is usually asymptomatic and may be manifested only by an increased serum potassium concentration and characteristic electrocardiographic changes (peaking of T-waves, loss of P-wave, depression of S-T segment, and prolongation of the QT interval). Late manifestations include muscle paralysis and cardiovascular collapse from cardiac arrest.

Treatment measures for hyperkalemia include the elimination of foods and medications containing potassium and potassium-sparing diuretics, as well as ACE inhibitors, beta blocking agents, NSAIDs, heparin, and cyclosporine. In cases of life-threatening hyperkalemia, treatment measures may include: (1) intravenous administration of 300 to 500 ml/hr of 10% dextrose solution containing 10–20 units of insulin per 1,000 ml; (2) correction of acidosis, if present, with intravenous sodium bicarbonate; (3) use of exchange resins, hemodialysis, or peritoneal dialysis; (4) administration of a calcium salt to antagonize the cardiotoxic effects in patients whose electrocardiograms show appropriate characteristics, and who are not receiving digitalis glycosides; and (5) maintenance of a high urine output in suitable patients.

In treating hyperkalemia, it should be recalled that in patients who have been stabilized on digitalis, rapid lowering of serum potassium can produce digitalis toxicity.

### Levalbuterol tartrate (Xopenex HFA) [^116HyhLE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.7 Coexisting Conditions

XOPENEX HFA, like all sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias; in patients with convulsive disorders, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes mellitus; and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Clinically significant changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure have been seen in individual patients and could be expected to occur in some patients after the use of any beta-adrenergic bronchodilator.

Large doses of intravenous racemic albuterol have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.

5.8 Hypokalemia

As with other beta-adrenergic agonist medications, XOPENEX HFA may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease is usually transient, not requiring supplementation.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Adverse effects related to angiotensin suppression in heart failure (HF) with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) therapy include hypotension and dizziness, and symptomatic hypotension with first doses may not recur with repeated administration; the doses of other hypotensive agents can be reduced or staggered, and most patients remain excellent candidates for long-term ACE inhibition if appropriate measures minimize recurrence. Severe hyponatremia is identified as a risk factor, defined as serum sodium concentration less than 130 mmol per liter. Worsening renal function is described, with a significant increase in serum creatinine (greater than 0.3 mg per dL) observed in 15% to 30% of patients with severe HF and in only 5% to 15% of those with mild to moderate symptoms; renal function usually improves after reduction of concomitantly administered diuretics, and if diuretics cannot be reduced because of fluid retention, mild to moderate degrees of azotemia may need to be tolerated to maintain ACEI therapy. Hyperkalemia can occur and may be sufficiently severe to cause cardiac conduction disturbances, particularly when renal function deteriorates or with oral potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, or aldosterone antagonists, especially in diabetes mellitus.

### Potassium-lowering effect of albuterol for hyperkalemia in renal failure… [^115EkJWM]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- To study the effect of specific β2-adrenergic stimulation on potassium metabolism in renal failure, we intravenously administered albuterol sulfate, 0. 5 mg, to 20 patients with chronic renal failure receiving maintenance hemodialysis. Within 30 minutes after albuterol administration, serum potassium level dropped from 5. 6 ±
0. 2 to 4. 5 ±
0. 2 mEq/L. There were no changes in plasma aldosterone levels or arterial pH, but blood glucose and serum insulin levels increased. Albuterol, however, induced similar decreases in serum potassium levels in three diabetic patients while free C peptide levels remained undetectable or subnormal after administration of the drug. Albuterol sulfate alone was also used to treat 24 patients with acute or chronic renal failure and hyperkalemia. Their serum potassium levels dropped from 7 ± 0. 2 mEq/L to
5. 6 ± 0. 2 mEq/L,
5. 6 ± 0. 2 mEq/L, 6 ±
0. 2 mEq/L, and 6. 2 ±
0. 2 mEq/L at 30, 60, 180, and 360 minutes after receiving albuterol, respectively, and this was accompanied by reversal of the electrocardiographic manifestations of hyperkalemia. Despite inducing transient tachycardia, albuterol was remarkably well tolerated and no serious side effects were observed. β2-adrenergic stimulation of intracellular potassium uptake by albuterol is a safe and effective alternative for the treatment of hyperkalemia in renal failure.

### Acute treatment of hyperkalemia… [^117LTsys]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What is the best acute treatment of an elevated serum potassium level. Evidence-Based Answer According to disease-oriented evidence, insulin and intravenous glucose, inhaled albuterol, and dialysis are the best treatment options; the first two may be given in combination. Bicarbonate or resins are not recommended for routine use, particularly without one of the more effective agents listed above. Practice Pointers Acute treatment of hyperkalemia falls into the still considerable "widely used but little studied" category of medical interventions. No study has reported outcomes that matter to patients, such as the likelihood of death or cardiac arrhythmias. The available literature focuses largely on the ability of interventions to lower serum potassium levels acutely. The Cochrane review by Mahoney and colleagues applies to patients with a significantly elevated potassium level.

Each patient acts as his or her own control, so it is possible to have a much smaller sample size and still obtain statistically significant results. Only four studies used blinding, and only four concealed allocation to treatment groups adequately. Most of the patients studied had acute or chronic renal failure and were receiving hemodialysis. Nebulized or inhaled albuterol proved effective; a dose of 20 mg was more effective than 10 mg in lowering potassium levels, and both doses were better than placebo. Intravenous albuterol and levalbuterol were no more effective than inhaled albuterol. The combination of insulin with intravenous glucose was effective, as was dialysis. In one study, the combination of insulin, glucose, and inhaled albuterol was more effective than insulin and glucose alone. Although potassium-binding polystyrene resins such as Kayexalate are widely used, only one study evaluated their effectiveness in the acute setting, and they proved ineffective.

Adding bicarbonate to insulin and glucose was helpful in one study but not in another. A review of the National Guideline Clearinghouse Website did not identify any practice guidelines for the management of hyperkalemia. Recommendations from textbooks vary considerably. For example, Griffith's 5-Minute Clinical Consult 2005 1 recommends dextrose and insulin, sodium bicarbonate, and polystyrene resins but does not mention inhaled beta agonists.

### Reduced risk of hyperkalemia using sacubitril / valsartan vs enalapril… [^112Ku1Ke]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, we examined the incidence of hyperkalemia and severe hyperkalemia according to use of MRA at baseline among patients with HFrEF randomly assigned to treatment with enalapril or sacubitril/valsartan as part of the PARADIGM-HF trial. We examined all postbaseline measurements of serum potassium to assess the incidence of hyperkalemia among patients treated or not treated with an MRA at baseline during the median 27-month follow-up in the PARADIGM-HF trial. Incident hyperkalemia was defined as having a potassium level higher than 5. 5 mEq/L, and severe hyperkalemia was defined as having a potassium level higher than
6. 0 mEq/L.

The serum potassium and creatinine levels by study visit among MRA-treated patients in each randomized group are summarized in Figure 2. As shown, changes in potassium levels did not parallel changes in renal function over time. For participants randomly assigned to enalapril, diabetes, screening potassium level, baseline potassium level, baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate, region, and lower body mass index remained statistically significant predictors of hyperkalemia in multivariable models. For participants randomly assigned to sacubitril/valsartan, diabetes, screening potassium level, baseline potassium level, higher natriuretic peptide levels, and higher NYHA class were predictors. As anticipated, incident hyperkalemia was more frequent among MRA-treated patients in the PARADIGM-HF trial; however, the risk of serious hyperkalemia was lower when MRAs were used in combination with sacubitril/valsartan rather than an ACE inhibitor.

Little difference between treatment groups was seen in the rates of hyperkalemia among patients not treated with an MRA at baseline, suggesting that sacubitril/valsartan may selectively attenuate MRA-associated increases in serum potassium levels. Because the rates of hyperkalemia observed during treatment with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are consistent in previous studies, these data point to a clinically important effect of sacubitril on potassium homeostasis.
