## Question

disease with thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, leukocytosis, atypical lymphocytes, fatigue

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which disease best explains the combination of thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, leukocytosis, atypical lymphocytes, and fatigue. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which single entity coherently accounts for all five features. Then, I should verify competing differentials that might match some but not all of these findings. Next, I will review the strength of evidence for the leading diagnosis, including sensitivity and specificity data. Finally, I will outline the immediate diagnostic workup and key exclusions to confirm the diagnosis and guide management.

> Let me first confirm the leading diagnosis. Infectious mononucleosis due to Epstein-Barr virus (IM/EBV) fits all five elements: thrombocytopenia occurs in more than half of cases, splenomegaly is present in about 50%, leukocytosis with lymphocytosis is typical, atypical lymphocytes are a hallmark and their proportion strongly increases the likelihood of IM, and fatigue is a core constitutional symptom; importantly, the likelihood of IM rises substantially with increasing percentages of atypical lymphocytes on smear, which ties the laboratory pattern to the clinical picture [^0cd73e54] [^c3d236d5].

> Wait, let me verify the atypical lymphocyte point because it is pivotal. The rational clinical examination meta-analysis shows that atypical lymphocytes ≥ 10% confer a positive likelihood ratio around 11, ≥ 20% around 26, and ≥ 40% around 50, and the combination of > 50% lymphocytes with > 10% atypical forms yields a specificity near 0.99 with a positive LR near 54, which is highly discriminative for IM; this is exactly the pattern we expect here and supports IM as the unifying diagnosis when all five features coexist [^0cd73e54].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review competing differentials and check where they fail to match. Hairy cell leukemia can cause splenomegaly and cytopenias but typically presents with pancytopenia rather than leukocytosis and does not feature atypical lymphocytes; its lymphocytes have a characteristic hairy morphology and immunophenotype, which would not be described as "atypical" in the IM sense, so this is a mismatch for the leukocytosis and atypical lymphocyte components [^1a14a5c5] [^20ec0fff]. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia can cause splenomegaly and fatigue, but the circulating cells are mature-appearing small lymphocytes rather than atypical lymphocytes, and thrombocytopenia in CLL is often autoimmune rather than viral, so the smear pattern again argues against CLL here [^1763a9a6]. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia can present with leukocytosis, splenomegaly, and fatigue, but the diagnostic threshold requires ≥ 20% blasts and the clinical context is usually pediatric or adolescent; moreover, ALL blasts are not the classic atypical lymphocytes seen in IM, so this would be a different smear pattern and age distribution [^823d85a6]. Myelofibrosis and other MPNs can produce splenomegaly and cytopenias, but leukocytosis with atypical lymphocytes is not expected, and the marrow pathology would differ markedly from a viral lymphocytosis, making MPNs unlikely to unify these five features [^712e750c] [^5d0e1022].

> I should double-check infectious differentials that can mimic parts of this. CMV can cause a mononucleosis-like syndrome with atypical lymphocytes and splenomegaly, but concurrent EBV infection is less likely to be the unifying driver unless documented; still, dual viral infections do occur, so serologies should be checked to exclude CMV if EBV testing is negative or equivocal [^notfound]. Visceral leishmaniasis causes fever, splenomegaly, and pancytopenia, but leukocytosis with atypical lymphocytes is not expected, and the epidemiology would require travel to endemic regions, so this pattern mismatch and risk context make VL less likely here [^377531e1]. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis can present with cytopenias, splenomegaly, and systemic symptoms, but leukocytosis with atypical lymphocytes is not a typical feature, and HLH would usually show markedly elevated ferritin and other inflammatory markers rather than a viral lymphocytosis pattern, so this does not fit as well as IM for the given constellation [^ec148ff4].

> Next, I should review the immediate diagnostic workup to confirm IM and exclude alternatives. I need to check EBV serology with IgM to EBV viral capsid antigen and consider EBV DNA PCR if acute infection is uncertain or in older adults, because heterophile testing can be falsely negative outside the classic age range; I should also obtain a peripheral smear to quantify atypical lymphocytes, a CBC with differential to characterize the leukocytosis, and liver enzymes given frequent mild transaminitis in IM; if EBV is negative or the presentation is atypical, I should add CMV serology and consider HIV testing, and if cytopenias are severe or persistent, I should evaluate for alternative diagnoses including bone marrow disorders, but the pretest probability remains highest for EBV IM given the full pentad [^0cd73e54] [^3592aad4] [^6950a17d].

> But wait, what if the patient is older or has unusual features? I need to ensure I do not anchor prematurely. Although IM is classically a disease of adolescents and young adults, case reports and series document IM in older adults, where the diagnosis is often delayed; thus, age alone should not exclude EBV when the laboratory pattern is classic, but I should maintain a lower threshold to broaden testing if the course is atypical or severe [^3592aad4].

> In summary, after weighing the differential and the strength of evidence, infectious mononucleosis due to EBV is the most coherent explanation for the simultaneous presence of thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, leukocytosis, atypical lymphocytes, and fatigue; the markedly increased likelihood of IM with atypical lymphocytes, the frequency of thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly in IM, and the relative poor fit of alternative diagnoses collectively support this conclusion, pending confirmatory EBV testing and appropriate exclusions [^0cd73e54] [^c3d236d5].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **infectious mononucleosis (IM)** [^0cd73e54] caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), given the combination of thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, leukocytosis with atypical lymphocytes, and fatigue. IM typically presents with **leukocytosis and atypical lymphocytes** [^0cd73e54], and splenomegaly is common; thrombocytopenia is usually mild and self-limited [^c3d236d5]. Alternative considerations include CMV infection, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) [^823d85a6], and lymphoma [^4377bc8e], but these are less likely based on the clinical pattern. Confirm with **EBV serology** (heterophile antibody test, EBV IgM/IgG) [^0cd73e54] and a peripheral smear [^0a30a835]; manage supportively and advise activity restriction to reduce splenic injury risk [^d79652c2].

---

## Infectious mononucleosis (IM)

IM is the **most common cause** of this constellation in adolescents and young adults [^0cd73e54]. EBV drives lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes, splenomegaly, and mild thrombocytopenia; fatigue is prominent and often prolonged [^c3d236d5].

- **Leukocytosis and atypical lymphocytes**: Characteristic of IM, with atypical lymphocytes comprising 20–40% of WBCs [^c3d236d5].
- **Splenomegaly**: Present in ~50% of cases, reflecting lymphoid hyperplasia and extramedullary hematopoiesis [^c3d236d5].
- **Thrombocytopenia**: Mild and self-limited, typically 50–150 × 10⁹/L, due to immune-mediated destruction and splenic sequestration [^c3d236d5].
- **Fatigue**: Common and often persistent for weeks to months [^notfound].

---

## Alternative diagnoses

While IM is most likely, **other entities** can mimic some features:

| **Condition** | **Key distinguishing features** |
|-|-|
| Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection | Similar mononucleosis syndrome; diagnose with CMV serology [^notfound] |
| Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) | Blasts ≥ 20% in marrow/blood; cytogenetics/flow required [^823d85a6] |
| Lymphoma (e.g. Hodgkin, non-Hodgkin) | Lymphadenopathy, B symptoms, biopsy diagnostic [^notfound] |
| Hairy cell leukemia | Pancytopenia, splenomegaly, hairy cells on smear [^notfound] |
| Myelofibrosis | Anemia, splenomegaly, leukoerythroblastosis, marrow fibrosis [^ce9eda74] |

---

## Diagnostic approach

- **Confirmatory testing**: EBV heterophile antibody test, EBV-specific IgM/IgG, and a peripheral smear to quantify atypical lymphocytes [^0cd73e54].
- **Exclusion of alternatives**: Consider CMV serology, bone marrow evaluation, or lymph node biopsy if atypical features or persistent cytopenias arise [^notfound].
- **Imaging**: Abdominal ultrasound to confirm splenomegaly and assess spleen size for activity guidance [^d79652c2].

---

## Management

Management is **supportive**, with rest, hydration, and analgesics; corticosteroids are reserved for severe complications (e.g. airway obstruction, severe thrombocytopenia). Activity restriction is essential to reduce splenic rupture risk until splenomegaly resolves [^d79652c2].

---

IM is the **most likely diagnosis** given the classic triad of leukocytosis with atypical lymphocytes, splenomegaly, and fatigue, plus mild thrombocytopenia. Confirm with EBV serology and smear, and manage supportively with activity restriction.

### Chronic neutrophilic leukemia: new science and new diagnostic criteria [^a8f8d8c8]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical features

CNL is a clinically heterogeneous disease which may present as incidental neutrophilic leukocytosis on a routine blood count or alternatively with a spectrum of constitutional symptoms including fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, bone pain, easy bruising, pruritus, or gout. The majority of patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis. Of presenting clinical manifestations, fatigue appears to be the most common. In a series of 14 molecularly defined CNL patients, 71% had antecedent chronic leukocytosis lasting a median of 12.5 months (range 5–84 months). Clinical examination may reveal splenomegaly (present in 36% in one series) involving primarily red pulp cords and sinuses, and/or hepatomegaly, but as in CML, lymph node involvement remains relatively uncommon.

There is substantial evidence for an association of CNL with a hemorrhagic diathesis. Reports as early as 1979 describe an "unexplained hemorrhagic tendency" in a portion of CNL patientswhich has been reiterated in later reports. including a considerable number of cases of cerebral hemorrhage. In a report by Bohm, of 14 new cases of CNL reviewed of which 10 had died (mean survival time 14.7 months), the most frequent cause of death was in fact cerebral hemorrhage, seen in six cases. Mechanistically, this bleeding diathesis has been attributed to thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction, and/or potentially to vascular wall infiltration by neoplastic cells. It has been suggested that patients displaying bleeding complications out of proportion to their platelet count be evaluated for acquired von Willebrand's disease and other acquired coagulation and platelet function disorders.

### Does this patient have infectious mononucleosis? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^0cd73e54]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Early, accurate diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis can help clinicians target treatment, avoid antibiotics, and provide an accurate prognosis.

Objective

To systematically review the literature regarding the value of the clinical examination and white blood cell count for the diagnosis of mononucleosis.

Data Sources

The databases of PubMed (from 1966–2016) and EMBASE (from 1947–2015) were searched and a total of 670 articles and abstracts were reviewed for eligibility.

Study Selection

Eleven studies were included that reported data sufficient to calculate sensitivity, specificity, or both for clinical examination findings and white blood cell count parameters compared with a valid reference standard.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were abstracted from each article by at least 2 reviewers, with discrepancies reconciled by consensus. Clinical findings evaluated in only 1 study are reported with sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratio (LR), and 95% confidence interval, which were calculated from the available data. Findings evaluated in only 2 studies were summarized with their range, findings evaluated in 3 studies were summarized with a univariate random-effects summary, and findings evaluated in 4 or more studies were summarized with a bivariate random-effects meta-analysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sensitivity, specificity, and LRs for the diagnosis of mononucleosis.

Results

Mononucleosis is most commonly present among patients aged 5 to 25 years (especially those aged 16–20 years, among whom approximately 1 in 13 patients presenting with sore throat has mononucleosis). The likelihood of mononucleosis is reduced with the absence of any lymphadenopathy (summary sensitivity, 0.91; positive LR range, 0.23–0.44), whereas the likelihood increases with the presence of posterior cervical adenopathy (summary specificity, 0.87; positive LR, 3.1 [95% CI, 1.6–5.9]), inguinal or axillary adenopathy (specificity range, 0.82–0.91; positive LR range, 3.0–3.1), palatine petechiae (specificity, 0.95; positive LR, 5.3 [95% CI, 2.1–13]), and splenomegaly (specificity range, 0.71–0.99; positive LR range, 1.9–6.6). Symptoms are of limited value for the diagnosis of mononucleosis; sore throat and fatigue are sensitive (range, 0.81–0.83) but nonspecific. The presence of atypical lymphocytosis significantly increases the likelihood of mononucleosis (summary LR, 11.4 [95% CI, 2.7–35] for atypical lymphocytes ≥ 10%, 26 [95% CI, 9.6–68] for those with 20%, and 50 [95% CI, 38–64] for those with 40%). The combination of a patient having greater than 50% lymphocytes and greater than 10% atypical lymphocytes also is useful (specificity, 0.99; positive LR, 54 [95% CI, 8.4–189]).

Conclusions and Relevance

In adolescent and adult patients presenting with sore throat, the presence of posterior cervical, inguinal or axillary adenopathy, palatine petechiae, splenomegaly, or atypical lymphocytosis is associated with an increased likelihood of mononucleosis.

### Why does my patient have thrombocytosis? [^b519ddbb]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytosis is a common clinical problem frequently encountered during routine evaluation. The diagnostic workup entails a step-by-step approach, which allows for an accurate assessment of the underlying cause. A thorough clinical history and physical examination may help differentiate thrombocytosis secondary to a reactive process versus an underlying clonal proliferation process. Once essential thrombocytosis is evident, relevant laboratory evaluation for an ongoing myeloproliferative disorder is paramount. Various treatment modalities have been proven to be beneficial. With further scientific investigation underway, molecular therapies may soon be cornerstones of therapy in essential thrombocytosis.

### Acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a comprehensive review and 2017 update [^dc57a8b7]. Blood Cancer Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Most of the clinical manifestations of ALL reflect the accumulation of malignant, poorly differentiated lymphoid cells within the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and, extramedullary sites. Presentation can be nonspecific, with a combination of constitutional symptoms and signs of bone marrow failure (anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia). Common symptoms include 'B symptoms' (fever, weight loss, night sweats), easy bleeding or bruising, fatigue, dyspnea and infection. Involvement of extramedullary sites commonly occurs and can cause lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly or hepatomegaly in 20% of patients. CNS involvement at time of diagnosis occurs in 5–8% of patients and present most commonly as cranial nerve deficits or meningismus.T-cell ALL also may present with a mediastinal mass.

Diagnosis is established by the presence of 20% or more lymphoblasts in the bone marrow or peripheral blood. Evaluation for morphology, flow cytometry, Immunophenotyping and cytogenetic testing is valuable both for confirming the diagnosis and risk stratification. Lumbar puncture with CSF analysis is standard of care at the time of diagnosis to evaluate for CNS involvement. If the CNS is involved, brain MRI should be performed. Other evaluation includes complete blood count with differential and smear to evaluate the other hematopoietic cell lines, coagulation profiles and serum chemistries. Baseline uric acid, calcium, phosphate and lactate dehydrogenase should be recorded to monitor for tumor lysis syndrome.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^a98993b7]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale for question

Hematologic abnormalities (i.e. leukopenia, lymphopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and/or pancytopenia) are manifestations of sarcoidosis that raise the possibility of bone marrow involvement, although this is not the most common cause of such abnormalities. Splenomegaly with sequestration may be a more common cause of hematologic abnormalities. In the absence of splenomegaly, compartmentalization of white blood cells to the site of organ involvement is a common cause of leukopenia and lymphopenia (,–). Additional causes of hematologic abnormalities are hepatic sarcoidosis, nonsarcoidosis medical problems, and treatment with immunosuppressive therapies, like methotrexate. Less-frequent hematologic abnormalities attributed to sarcoidosis include eosinophilia, hemolytic anemia, and idiopathic thrombocytopenia. Pancytopenia may be a presenting manifestation of sarcoidosis, but the cytopenia more often presents as a secondary finding in those with active disease. As a result, the committee asked whether patients with sarcoidosis should undergo a baseline complete blood cell count testing to screen for hematological abnormalities.

### A novel colony stimulating factor 3 receptor activating mutation identified in a patient with chronic neutrophilic leukemia [^1580c863]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

CSF3R N579Y was identified in a patient presenting with a myeloproliferative neoplasm with neutrophilia and splenomegaly. The patient was a 55-year-old man with a 3-month history of progressive fatigue and a 40-pound weight loss. At the time of his initial presentation, his white blood count was 96.48x10 9 /L with a differential of 3% bands, 74% neutrophils, 4% lymphs, 3% monocytes, 6% metameyelocytes, 8% myelocytes, and 2% promyelocytes. Hemoglobin was 10.9 g/dL and platelets were 740x10 9 /L. One year prior, his WBC had been normal with a mild monocytosis. Bone marrow (BM) biopsy revealed a markedly hypercellular (90% cellular) BM exhibiting myeloid-predominant maturing trilineage hematopoiesis with left-shifted myeloid maturation, mild megakaryocytic atypia (small, hypolobated forms), mild reticulin fibrosis most consistent with a myeloid neoplasm. Given the myeloid-predominant BM without significant dysgranulopoiesis in the context of peripheral leukocytosis with peripheral neutrophilia, a diagnosis of chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) was favored. However, the left-shifted myeloid maturation and reticulin fibrosis is atypical. CML was excluded given the absence of a BCR-ABL1 positive fusion transcript, and aCML was excluded due to lack of significant dysgranulopoiesis. The patient had had a history of a seizure substance use disorder and had subsequently been found unresponsive with a large intracranial hemorrhage. He was started on hydroxyurea and transitioned to a palliative approach before succumbing to his disease. It had not been possible to perform germline testing.

### Splenomegaly: a combined clinical and radiologic approach to the differential diagnosis [^3d94be8b]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

An enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) is a common imaging finding and may be related to a broad array of underlying conditions. The multifaceted functions of the spleen make it susceptible to involvement by a variety of pathophysiologic processes. Understanding these conditions and incorporating all relevant clinical and radiologic data allow narrowing the differential diagnosis.

### Thrombocytopenia and fever: not just another infection… [^8b6e3fdb]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a high-grade, aggressive disease that typically presents with widespread lymphadenopathy and active 'B' symptoms, making it easy to recognise and manage. However, a small proportion of patients can present with no evidence of lymphadenopathy or organomegaly, with the disease confined to the bone marrow; this presentation is also known as 'Primary Bone Marrow DLBCL'. Subsequently, diagnosis can be a challenge, resulting in delayed treatment and an overall poorer prognosis. Given the rarity of this disease, we wished to describe a patient who presented initially with fevers associated with isolated thrombocytopenia and was later diagnosed with this condition. Unfortunately, due to the aggressive nature of this disease, subsequent treatment was unsuccessful. Overall, we felt that in future cases of fevers with thrombocytopenia, clinicians should include this rare lymphoma subtype as part of the differential diagnosis, as early identification and treatment can be associated with a favourable outcome.

### Chronic myeloid leukemia: a review [^dc5ec2da]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on chronic myeloid leukemia:

- **Definition**: CML is a malignant clonal disorder of hematopoietic stem cells resulting in unregulated growth of myeloid cells in the bone marrow.
- **Pathophysiology**: CML is caused by a chromosomal abnormality termed as Philadelphia chromosome, which results from the presence of BCR-ABL oncogene.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include fatigue, weight loss, abdominal fullness, bleeding, purpura, splenomegaly, leukocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytosis. Disease progression may lead to bone pain, hepatosplenomegaly, severe anemia, infections, lymphadenopathy, CNS disease, and increased risk of death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: CML is associated with a mortality crude rate of 0.78.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and prolymphocytic leukaemia. two coins or two sides of the same coin? [^882f2289]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has a distinct morphology and immunophenotype. Despite lacking specific genetic abnormalities, the diagnosis is straightforward even in cases with atypical morphology. B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL) is a rare lymphoid neoplasm first described in 1974 as an aggressive variant of CLL. It differs from CLL in morphology and immunophenotype and it is recognized as a distinct entity in the World Health Organisation classification. Like CLL, B-PLL does not have recurrent genetic alterations although MYC abnormalities, TP53 mutations and complex karyotypes are frequent. The diagnosis of B-PLL relies on cytology, the immunophenotype and on investigations that rule out other splenomegalic B-cell neoplasms, particularly, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). A debated issue is whether B-PLL represents the evolution of a CLL, particularly in cases with increased prolymphocytes (CLL/PL), or if it is a different entity. The differences in cytology, the immunophenotype and gene expression profile between CLL and B-PLL would argue against them being the same entity in two phases of disease evolution.

We describe a patient that manifested with a " bona fide " B-PLL and who was successfully treated with immunochemotherapy. Upon "relapse" there was evidence of a different B-cell clone with a morphology and immunophenotype consistent with CLL. This case reinforces the notion of the existence of B-PLL as an entity distinct from CLL.

A 57-year-old male presented with a 6-week history of weight loss and fatigue. Examination revealed splenomegaly and no lymphadenopathy. The white blood cell count (WBC) was 89.61x10 9 /L with 91% lymphocytes, hemoglobin 118 g/L and a normal platelet count. The biochemistry was normal except for lactate dehydrogenase that was raised to 894 UI/L (250–450 UI/L). No monoclonal band was detected by immunofixation. Peripheral blood (PB) showed medium to large sized lymphoid cells with a round prominent single nucleolus, and moderately basophilic cytoplasm. The morphology was consistent with the cell being a prolymphocyte (Figure 1A). Flow cytometry showed that 93% of cells were clonal B-lymphocytes l +, CD5 +, FMC7 ++. CD10, CD23, CD200 and CD43 were negative. The antigen intensity of CD20, CD22 and CD79b was normal (Figure 1B). A positron emission tomography scan confirmed the splenomegaly and showed infracentimetric widespread lymphadenopathy without F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose uptake.

### A patient with gaucher disease and plasma cell dyscrasia: bidirectional impact [^5edb892f]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with Gaucher disease (GD), a rare autosomal recessive glycosphingolipid storage disease, commonly present to hematologists with unexplained splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and bone symptoms. Patients with GD may develop other manifestations, such as autoimmune thrombocytopenia, monoclonal gammopathy, multiple myeloma, or, even more rarely, other hematological malignancies; sometimes they are first diagnosed during an assessment of those disorders. Although the diagnosis and management of patients with GD have significantly evolved over the last 30 years, some patients remain poor responders to GD-specific therapy, needing novel and investigational therapies. Ideally, patients with GD, like patients with other rare diseases, should be managed by a multidisciplinary team expert with the diverse clinical manifestations and potential GD-related or -unrelated comorbidities. The hematology community should be knowledgeable regarding the presentation and the variety of hematologic complications and comorbidities associated with Gaucher disease.

### An atypical presentation of Sweet's syndrome in a myelofibrosis patient [^2ea0eebe]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 46-year-old man with no significant medical history presented to haematology with symptoms of fatigue, dyspnoea on exertion and weight loss. Physical examination revealed a lesion on the right shin and splenomegaly. Labs were significant for leucocytosis with immature components, thrombocytosis and 3% peripheral blasts on smear. A bone marrow biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of myelofibrosis (MF). Dynamic International Prognosis Scoring system was 2. He was started on ruxolitnib, with decitabine added subsequently prior to definitive therapy with an allogenic haematopoietic stem cell transplant. His course with decitabine was complicated with febrile neutropaenia with multiple tender erythematous plaques unresponsive to antibacterial and antifungal coverage. A skin biopsy showed neutrophilic dermatitis, consistent with a diagnosis of Sweet's syndrome (SS) and empirical treatment with glucocorticoids was initiated resulting in resolution of symptoms. This report reviews the literature for cases of SS in the setting of MF.

### How I treat splenomegaly in myelofibrosis [^ce91f569]. Blood Cancer Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Treatment of splenomegaly

It is generally agreed that, if patients with MF have no symptoms, a wait-and-see approach is a reasonable option, with treatment being delayed until significant changes are observed. It is likely that such conservative approach will change as soon as more effective therapies for the disease will become available. The above wait-and-see policy also applies to asymptomatic splenomegaly, especially taking into account that MF patients have often concurrent cytopenias that may worsen following treatment institution.

### Thrombocytopenia in patients with myelofibrosis: management options in the era of JAK inhibitor therapy [^018e30bd]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2020). Medium credibility.

Myelofibrosis (MF), either appearing de novo (primary MF, PMF) or after a previous diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia or of polycythemia vera, is a progressive disease burdened by symptomatic splenomegaly, debilitating systemic symptoms, ineffective hematopoiesis, and overall reduced survival. Patients often present worsening cytopenias, including thrombocytopenia, secondary to progression of the disease as well as to cytoreductive treatment. Patients with MF and thrombocytopenia have few therapeutic options and there is limited information regarding the management of disease in these settings. This article reviews current evidence for the management of patients with MF and thrombocytopenia, in the era of JAK inhibitors.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 myeloproliferative neoplasms — clinical features note that symptom profiles often include fatigue, pruritus, weight loss, and symptoms from splenomegaly, with laboratory abnormalities such as erythrocytosis, thrombocytosis, leukocytosis, and sometimes myeloid immaturity, especially in progressive myelofibrosis (MF). A SEER-Medicare database analysis showed that patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) have substantially inferior survival compared to matched controls, with survival for MF worse than that of essential thrombocythemia (ET) or polycythemia vera (PV), and MPN also have the propensity for disease transformation into blast phase (MPN-BP), which is akin to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is associated with a poor prognosis.

### Unexplained lymphadenopathies: autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome in an adult patient [^d625d227]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Discussion

ALPS is a disease characterised by immune dysregulation due to an inability to regulate lymphocyte homoeostasis through abnormalities in lymphocyte apoptosis or programmed cell death. The required clinical criteria are the presence of chronic lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, present for more than 6 months, which may be asymptomatic and incidentally identified during routine physical examinations. In our case, the patient presented with hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and multiple lymph node enlargements during a period of 6 months. Patients with ALPS may present initially with episodes of fatigue, pallor and icterus due to haemolytic anaemia. They may also be more likely to have easy bruising and mucocutaneous bleeding caused by thrombocytopenia. In our case, the patient was taken to the emergency room with pallor, petechial, oral haemorrhagic bullae and a platelet count of 4000/µL.

### How I treat splenomegaly in myelofibrosis [^6097586e]. Blood Cancer Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The splenomegaly of MF

Splenomegaly, one of the most characteristic features of MF, is due to extramedullary hemopoiesis (also called myeloid metaplasia), which affects not only the spleen but also the liver (and, for this reason, hepatomegaly and alterations of the liver function often coexist) and, more unfrequently, other sites such as the lung, the kidney, the central nervous system, the lymph nodes or the skin. The spleen is palpable in up to 90% of MF patients at presentation. In this sense, it must be noted that if the spleen is not palpable at diagnosis and does not become palpable after 1 or 2 years, the possibility of other conditions such as myelodysplasia, which can also cause cytopenias and marrow fibrosis, should be excluded by careful examination of the bone marrow histopathologic features. Symptoms from splenomegaly usually correlate with spleen size. Thus, some patients with moderate splenomegaly may not have local symptoms initially. However, as the spleen progressively increases, it produces mechanical discomfort in the left part of the abdomen, occasionally episodes of severe pain in the left upper quadrant irradiating to the shoulder and due to splenic infarctions, early saciety and diarrhea. These symptoms are frequently associated with profound cachexia and fatigue, accentuation of pre-existing cytopenias and, sometimes, signs of portal hypertension. Of note, despite its clinical relevance in MF, splenomegaly is not per se a poor prognostic factor of the disease, as it is usually observed in patients displaying other well-recognized unfavorable prognostic factors, such as severe anemia, constitutional symptoms or marked leukocytosis.

A 32-year-old man who was receiving adalimumab for seronegative rheumatoid arthritis presented with a 4-week history of fever, night sweats, fatigue, myalgias and diarrhoea. On examination, he had obvious splenomegaly but no lymphadenopathy or pharyngitis. Full blood count revealed mild neutropenia and significant lymphocytosis, with a blood film showing atypical lymphocytes. Liver function tests were mildly deranged with a mixed hepatitic and obstructive pattern. Ultrasound confirmed massive splenomegaly with a span of 21 cm in the long axis. Serological tests confirmed the presence of both primary Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus infections. The patient had his adalimumab withheld, was treated with supportive measures and improved over a period of 8weeks. He remained well 5months after the onset of illness with complete normalisation of blood count and a resolution of the splenomegaly.

### A deep molecular response of splenic marginal zone lymphoma to front-line checkpoint blockade [^bf65dfd7]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) is an uncommon form of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) that frequently presents with prominent splenomegaly, often with circulating malignant lymphocytes but with modest lymphadenopathy. As SMZL is generally considered an incurable disease, treatment is often deferred until the manifestation of cytopenias, symptomatic splenomegaly, or constitutional symptoms warrant intervention. The current approach to frontline treatment typically involves rituximab given with or without chemotherapy, treatment of associated conditions such as hepatitis C infection, and less commonly splenectomy. Immune checkpoint blockade with agents such as anti- PD-1 antibodies have been effective in certain subtypes of B-NHL, but the use of these agents in patients with previously untreated SMZL has not yet been explored.

A 77 year-old man with a history of stage IIc melanoma treated with wide local excision with curative intent presented to the hematology clinic in June 2016 for evaluation of thrombocytopenia (Figure 1). An initial workup revealed what was thought to be an incidental IgA l and IgG κ monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and the decision was made to proceed with observation. However, after developing anemia and progressive thrombocytopenia, further workup was initiated, including imaging that revealed mild mediastinal and bilateral axillary adenopathy and prominent splenomegaly. A bone marrow biopsy was performed in June 2017 that showed an atypical lymphoid population positive for B-lymphoid markers CD19 and CD20, negative for CD5 and CD23, and l light chain restricted. Next-generation sequencing of the bone marrow aspirate using an in-house gene panel revealed a TP53 I195S mutation with a variant allele frequency of 0.06 and loss of PTEN. Though uncommon, adenopathy can occur in SMZL, and while splenic B-cell lymphoma unclassifiable was also considered, the combination of an aberrant immunophenotype, cytopenias, and significant splenomegaly made SMZL the most likely diagnosis. However, given the absence of symptoms, therapy was deferred at that time.

### Why does my patient have lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly? [^64a525be]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Lymph node or spleen enlargement may be innocent or the first sign of a serious disorder. Lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly can be found in symptomatic or asymptomatic patients. Lymph node enlargement in a single region or multiple sites can be seen in various diseases, including infections, noninfectious inflammatory conditions, or malignancies; a similar differential diagnosis applies to splenomegaly, but splenomegaly can also be caused by vascular abnormalities and hemolysis. Frequently, lymphadenopathy is detected incidentally during screening examinations or imaging procedures. This review focuses on causes of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly and an appropriate diagnostic approach to patients with lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly.

Case 2: Chronic neurovisceral ASMD

A male child presented with marked abdominal distension, chronic diarrhea, and failure to thrive at 6 months of age and was referred to a cystic fibrosis specialist. Other signs and symptoms of note included severe hepatosplenomegaly and hypotrophic muscles. Suspicion of an LSD resulted in referral to a metabolic specialist, who diagnosed ASMD with an enzyme assay. The patient was able to sit without support at 10 months of age. Laboratory findings included dyslipidemia, elevated liver transaminases, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. Lung involvement included interstitial pneumopathy with ground-glass aspect. Genotyping revealed one missense allele associated with infantile neurovisceral ASMD or with chronic neurovisceral ASMD and one nonsense allele associated with infantile neurovisceral ASMD. By 6 years of age, the patient also presented with developmental delay and recurrent respiratory infections.

Comment: Although some of the presenting features of this patient are similar to those of patients with infantile neurovisceral ASMD, the child's developmental milestones did not regress as in patients with infantile neurovisceral ASMD. The diagnosis at 9 months of age accompanied by a genotype that is insufficient to distinguish between infantile neurovisceral and chronic neurovisceral disease should make the monitoring of clinical signs important for the prediction of the clinical course.

Case 3: Pediatric-onset chronic visceral ASMD

A female child had normal growth and development for the first 2 years of life but was then noted to have splenomegaly at a routine pediatric visit. The child underwent a diagnostic workup for pediatric causes of splenomegaly including CBC, viral studies, and liver function tests that were all normal. The patient was eventually diagnosed with ASMD at age 6 when she developed severe nosebleeds and underwent a hematologic evaluation for thrombocytopenia, at which time she was noted to have hepatosplenomegaly and the possibility of a storage disease was added to the differential diagnosis. Genotyping revealed two missense mutations. The patient is now 10 years old and at the age-appropriate grade level in school, but she has not achieved appropriate height and suffers from fatigue. She has persistently increased transaminases and dyslipidemia with decreased HDL levels and increased triglycerides. Chest X-ray showed increased interstitial markings.

Comment: The patient presented with organomegaly, which is a common presenting sign in ASMD. The delay in diagnosis of 4 years is very common with patients with chronic visceral ASMD because they frequently have a lengthy diagnostic journey.

### Myeloproliferative neoplasms, version 3.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^712e750c]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) — epidemiology and clinical features in the United States include Philadelphia chromosome-negative disorders myelofibrosis (MF), polycythemia vera (PV), and essential thrombocythemia (ET). The prevalence of MF, ET, and PV is estimated at approximately 13,000, 134,000, and 148,000, respectively, and in 2002–2016 data the age-adjusted IRs per 100,000 person-years were highest for PV (IR = 1.57) and ET (IR = 1.55) and was 0.44 for primary MF (PMF). MPN are characterized by a complicated symptom profile that often includes fatigue, pruritus, weight loss, and symptoms from splenomegaly, with variable laboratory abnormalities such as erythrocytosis, thrombocytosis, leukocytosis, and sometimes myeloid immaturity, especially in progressive MF. A SEER-Medicare analysis showed substantially inferior survival for patients with MPN compared to matched controls, with survival for patients with MF worse than that of patients with ET or PV and significantly worse than matched controls, and these diseases have propensity for disease transformation to blast phase (MPN-BP), which is akin to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is associated with a poor prognosis. The diagnosis and comprehensive care of patients with MPN has evolved since identification of JAK-STAT "driver" mutations (JAK2, CALR, and MPL), and development of targeted therapies has resulted in significant improvements in disease-related symptoms and quality of life, although diagnosis, assessment of symptom burden, and selection of appropriate symptom-directed therapies continue to present challenges for hematologists and oncologists.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Leishmaniasis — clinical manifestations in HIV: The most common clinical presentation of leishmaniasis in HIV-infected individuals is a systemic visceral disease syndrome, with geographic variation; in Europe, visceral disease has been reported in 95% of cases (87% typical visceral, 8% atypical visceral), whereas in Brazil mucosal, visceral, and cutaneous forms have accounted for 43%, 37%, and 20% of reported cases, respectively. In patients with HIV and visceral disease, common findings include fever (65% to 100%), systemic malaise (70% to 90%), splenomegaly (usually moderate) (60% to 90%), hepatomegaly without splenomegaly (34% to 85%), hepatosplenomegaly (68% to 73%), lymphadenopathy (12% to 57%), and pancytopenia (50% to 80%). Hematologic abnormalities are characterized by anemia with < 10 g hemoglobin/dL (49% to 100%), leukopenia with < 2400 leukocytes/μL (56% to 95%), and thrombocytopenia (52% to 93%).

### How to approach thrombocytopenia [^6950a17d]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a common hematologic finding with variable clinical expression. A low platelet count may be the initial manifestation of infections such as HIV and hepatitis C virus or it may reflect the activity of life-threatening disorders such as the thrombotic microangiopathies. A correct identification of the causes of thrombocytopenia is crucial for the appropriate management of these patients. In this review, we present a systematic evaluation of adults with thrombocytopenia. The approach is clearly different between outpatients, who are frequently asymptomatic and in whom we can sometimes indulge in sophisticated and relatively lengthy investigations, and the dramatic presentation of acute thrombocytopenia in the emergency department or in the intensive care unit, which requires immediate intervention and for which only a few diagnostic tests are available. A brief discussion of the most common etiologies seen in both settings is provided.

Polycythemia vera — treatment for low-risk disease includes "Manage cardiovascular risk factors (MPN-H)," "Aspirin (81–100 mg/day)," and "Phlebotomy (to maintain hematocrit < 45%)," and "Cytoreductive therapy is not recommended as initial treatment." Monitor for new thrombosis or bleeding, evaluate for indications for cytoreductive therapy, and monitor signs/symptoms of disease progression. Indications for cytoreductive therapy include "New thrombosis or disease-related major bleeding," "Frequent phlebotomy or intolerant of phlebotomy," "Splenomegaly," "Progressive thrombocytosis and/or leukocytosis," and "Disease-related symptoms (eg, pruritus, night sweats, fatigue)." "Initiate cytoreductive therapy"; preferred regimens are "Clinical trial or Ropeginterferon alfa-2b-njft," with "Other recommended regimens: Hydroxyurea or Peginterferon alfa-2a." "Aspirin twice daily may be considered for patients with refractory symptoms." The hematocrit target is supported by "Hematocrit < 45% is based on the data from the CYTO-PV study" and "There may be situations in which a lower hematocrit cutoff may be appropriate and it should be individualized." Additional guidance notes that "While normalization of blood counts after initiation of treatment is usually a goal in clinical practice, it is not associated with long-term clinical benefit and there are no evidence-based data to recommend a target white blood cell (WBC) or platelet count," although "In selected patients with a severe thrombotic event or other disease-related symptoms, normalization of blood counts might be a goal of treatment." Patient-specific considerations include "Peginterferon alfa-2a is an option for younger patients or in pregnant patients in need of cytoreductive therapy," and "In the event that peginterferon alfa-2a is unavailable, the use of other available pegylated interferons (eg, ropeginterferon alfa-2b-njft) is appropriate." All recommendations are "category 2A unless otherwise indicated."

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^a7bc77bc]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Committee conclusions

The evidence suggests that hematological abnormalities are commonly detected in patients with sarcoidosis by a peripheral blood complete blood cell count and differential cell count. However, the abnormalities are often transient and, according to our systematic review, might be just as common among healthy control subjects. The committee noted that leukopenia and lymphopenia are common complications of sarcoidosis, and are related in almost all cases to inflammatory mechanisms, such as granulomatous bone marrow infiltration and the systemic effects of inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-α. Thus, there is no compelling reason to sample the bone marrow for alternative diagnoses in cases of sarcoidosis accompanied by leukopenia. Anemia, however, was common and an important finding, because it can contribute to sarcoidosis symptoms and signs, such as fatigue and shortness of breath, which may impact a patient's care. It can also be an indicator of other medical problems, and a complete blood cell count is usually needed when initiating cytotoxic immunosuppressive therapy. Taken together, the committee concluded that anemia, whether attributable to sarcoidosis or not, is clinically relevant, important to patients, and requires further evaluation.

Recommendation

1 We suggest that patients with sarcoidosis undergo baseline complete blood cell count testing to screen for hematological abnormalities (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence).

Research needs

The literature addressing hematologic abnormalities in sarcoidosis is decades old, and it is unclear whether it is applicable today, given the different laboratory tests and thresholds that are currently used. Splenectomy was previously used to treat cytopenia due to hypersplenism; even though splenectomy is less common today, there are no definitive alternative approaches that have been evaluated as treatments for hematologic abnormalities due to sarcoidosis. Lymphopenia and CD4, CD8, and CD19 lymphocyte subsets have been proposed as markers of more severe sarcoidosis, and patients with lymphopenia with sarcoidosis may be particularly responsive to anti–TNF-α treatment, although additional study is needed.

American Society of Hematology guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia — research priorities emphasize that the panel was able to make a strong recommendation for approximately one-fifth (5/21) of the prioritized questions and recommend methodological directions for future evidence generation. The panel recommends that collaborative cohort studies (retrospective and prospective), registries, and other observational studies addressing these issues could contribute much to improve the current levels of evidence and are likely more feasible than RCTs. These studies should apply standard dosing regimens and definitions, consistently report on patient-reported outcomes including HRQoL and side effects, and report long-term follow-up data. The panel also recommends ongoing collaborative engagement of patients to best understand how to apply these guidelines within the context of shared decision-making. Lastly, the panel recognizes that many of the management options covered in these recommendations are unavailable in certain countries; therefore global cost-effective strategies should also be assessed.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia - NCCN, more specifically with respect to diagnosis (general principles), NCCN 2020 guidelines recommend to suspect a diagnosis of myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia in the following clinical situations:

- sustained eosinophilia (≥ 1.5×10⁹/L) or tissue eosinophilia (any eosinophil count) in a target organ, with the occurrence of characteristic genetic breakpoints, some of which may not be visible by standard cytogenetics (e.g. FIP1L1::PDGFRA, ETV6::ABL1)

- clinical features such as splenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukoerythroblastosis, circulating dysplastic cells, elevated serum tryptase levels, and abnormal mast cell proliferation in the bone marrow

- features of systemic mastocytosis with eosinophilia but with interstitial, not dense aggregates of atypical mast cells (FIP1L1::PDGFRA rearrangement)

- features of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with eosinophilia (PDGFRB rearrangement)

- persistent eosinophilia after intensive treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, B-cell lymphoma, or T-cell lymphoma.

Diagnosis — clinical presentation and diagnostic thresholds in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL): The clinical presentation of ALL is typically nonspecific and may include fatigue or lethargy, constitutional symptoms, dyspnea, dizziness, infections, and easy bruising or bleeding, and among children, pain in the extremities or joints may be the only presenting symptom. The presence of lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and/or hepatomegaly on physical examination may be found in approximately 20% of patients, while abdominal masses from gastrointestinal involvement or chin numbness from cranial nerve involvement are more suggestive of mature B-cell ALL (B-ALL). The diagnosis of ALL generally requires demonstration of ≥ 20% bone marrow lymphoblasts on hematopathology review of bone marrow aspirate and biopsy materials; however, an immunophenotypically clonal lymphoblast population of < 20% can be considered ALL in appropriate circumstances. Peripheral blood may be substituted for bone marrow.

### Splenomegaly: diagnosis and management in adults [^d79652c2]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Splenomegaly can be due to several mechanisms but is almost always a sign of a systemic condition. Patient habits, travel, and medical conditions can increase risk of splenomegaly and suggest etiology. Symptoms can suggest infectious, malignant, hepatic, or hematologic causes. Physical examination will typically reveal splenomegaly, but abdominal ultrasonography is recommended for confirmation. Physical examination should also assess for signs of systemic illness, liver disease, and anemia or other hematologic issues. The most common causes of splenomegaly in the United States are liver disease, malignancy, and infection. Except for apparent causes such as infectious mononucleosis, basic laboratory analysis and ultrasonography are the first-line steps in determining etiology. Malaria and schistosomiasis are common in tropical regions, where as many as 80% of people may have splenomegaly. Management of splenomegaly involves treating the underlying disease process. Splenectomies and spleen reduction therapies are sometimes performed. Any patient with limited splenic function requires increased vaccination and prophylactic antibiotics for procedures involving the respiratory tract. Acute infections, anemia, and splenic rupture are the most common complications of splenomegaly, and people with splenomegaly should refrain from participating in contact sports to decrease risk of rupture.

Diagnosis

Clinical presentation and diagnostic workup

Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a rare and frequently fatal myeloproliferative neoplasm of early childhood with an estimated incidence of 1.2 cases per million and a median age at disease onset of ~ 2 years. Patients typically present with fever, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and a high circulating white blood cell (WBC) count with peripheral monocytosis and a leukoerythroblastic blood smear. Cough, bloody stools, an erythematous rash, or failure to thrive may also be observed. These symptoms are likely related to infiltration of monocytes into the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and spleen, respectively. Elevated hemoglobin F corrected for age is found in ~ 50% of patients. Apart from an extended infectious disease workup, further traditional diagnostic tools include bone marrow aspiration, a peripheral blood smear, and flow cytometry (diagnostic criteria per the 2016 Revision to World Health Organization [WHO] Classificationare summarized in Table 1). Bone marrow examination can display varying degrees of abnormal myelo- or megakaryopoiesis but must identify fewer than 20% blasts to rule out acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Bone marrow findings typically include hypercellularity with granulocytic hyperplasia and full maturation of myeloid progenitors, although increased monocytes are not always present. Dysplasia can be noted across all 3 hematopoietic lineages, and reticulin fibrosis is occasionally observed. In patients with monosomy 7, a predominance of erythroid precursors can be seen. Leukoerythroblastosis is not part of the WHO criteria for diagnosis of JMML but is commonly seen on peripheral blood smear and recapitulates the myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative properties of this overlap syndrome. Flow cytometry is often helpful at diagnosisto rule out other acute leukemias but does not play an important role thereafter unless the clinician is worried about progression to AML. Hyperphosphorylation of STAT5 was previously used as an adjunctive criterion for diagnosis but is not routinely offered in clinical laboratories. Similarly, hypersensitivity of myeloid progenitor cells to granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in colony-forming assays is a hallmark laboratory feature of JMML. However, GM-CSF hypersensitivity can be present in certain viral infections, is not routinely available, is difficult to interpret even in expert hands, and is therefore rarely used to establish a clinical diagnosis of JMML. A molecular confirmation is now possible in nearly every patient with JMML.

### Are transplant indications changing for myelofibrosis? [^7a2fcfca]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Myelofibrosis is a devastating myeloid malignancy characterized by dysregulation of the JAK-STAT pathway, resulting in splenomegaly, constitutional symptoms, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, and an increased likelihood of progression to acute leukemia. The only curative option is allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The numbers of transplants have been increasing every year, and although there have been improvements in survival, there remain many unanswered questions. In this review, we will evaluate patient selection and appropriate timing for transplantation. We will cover the current prognostic scoring systems, which can aid in the decision of when to move forward with transplant. We will also review the different donor options, as well as the conditioning regimens. The peritransplant management of splenomegaly will be reviewed. We will discuss management of posttransplant complications such as loss of donor chimerism or disease relapse. Finally, we will review what is known about the outlook of patients who have undergone allogeneic stem cell transplant with regards to quality of life and long-term survival.

Treatment for high-risk polycythemia vera — monitoring and management of inadequate response: Monitor for new thrombosis or bleeding and monitor response and signs/symptoms of disease progression as clinically indicated. Potential indications for change of cytoreductive therapy include intolerance or resistance to prior cytoreductive treatment, new thrombosis or disease-related major bleeding, frequent phlebotomy or intolerance of phlebotomy, splenomegaly, progressive thrombocytosis and/or leukocytosis, and disease-related symptoms (eg, pruritus, night sweats, fatigue). For inadequate response or loss of response, preferred regimens are clinical trial or ruxolitinib (category 1 for high-risk PV for hydroxyurea resistance or intolerance), with other recommended regimens being ropeginterferon alfa-2b-njft, hydroxyurea, or peginterferon alfa-2a if not previously used. Ruxolitinib is FDA approved for the treatment of patients with PV who have had an inadequate response or are intolerant of hydroxyurea. Response criteria were developed mainly for use in clinical trials, and response assessment should be done based on the improvement of disease-related symptoms at the discretion of the clinician. With disease progression, see MPN-2 (post-PV MF) or MPN-AP/BP-1 (accelerated/blast phase MPN).

### How I treat symptomatic splenomegaly in patients with myelofibrosis [^835b2941]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

Managing patients with myelofibrosis (MF), either those with primary MF or those whose MF has evolved from antecedent polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia, presents many challenges to the hematologist. MF patients have a range of debilitating disease manifestations (eg, massive splenomegaly, cytopenias, constitutional symptoms, and transformation to a treatment-refractory blast phase). Cure is potentially achievable through allogeneic stem cell transplantation; however, this therapy is either inappropriate or not feasible for the majority of patients. Therefore, remaining therapies are palliative but can be of significant value to some MF patients. In particular, management of symptomatic splenomegaly remains one of the most perplexing aspects of MF clinical care. Using medications is the simplest approach for reducing splenomegaly, yet achieving symptomatic response without undue myelosuppression is challenging. Splenectomy or radiotherapy offers benefit, but careful patient selection and close monitoring are required because both have the potential for dangerous adverse effects. Experimental medical therapies, such as JAK2 inhibitors, show promise and may soon play an important role in the management of symptomatic splenomegaly in MF patients. Future care of MF patients, including splenomegaly management, will continue to require the hematologist to select therapeutic options carefully in the context of realistic, achievable goals.

### Case report: COVID associated pancytopenia unmasking previously undiagnosed pernicious anemia [^3c7ebe74]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

CASE PRESENTATION

A 24-year-old active duty African American male presented to emergency room 18 days post COVID pneumonia infection, complaining of persistent fatigue, weakness, and subjective weight loss. He stated that his initial symptoms of dysgeusia, anosmia, headache, and fever had previously resolved since his initial COVID-positive test. He had no family history of blood disorders and had no significant past medical and surgical history. He was on no medications or supplements at the time of admission. Initial investigation with a complete blood count revealed a hemoglobin (HGB) of 4.1 g/dL, white blood cells (WBC) of 4.1 g/dL, and platelets (PLTs) of 64 × 10(9)/L. His anemia was normocytic (mean corpuscular volume [MCV] 95.3) and normochromic (mean corpuscular hemoglobin [MCH] 32.0). His leukopenia was lymphocytes predominant (55% lymphocytes, 33% granulocytes, and 6% monocytes). A peripheral smear was done which showed moderate oval macrocytes, anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, schistocytes, and atypical lymphocytes most consistent with a hypocellular sample with dilution. The patient was admitted to the medicine ward for blood transfusion, volume resuscitation, and further workup.

Diagnostic evaluation for hypo-proliferation, hemolysis, and malnutrition was initiated. There was concern for a hemolytic process so a bilirubin level was obtained, which was elevated at 3.4 mg/dL with indirect bilirubin predominance at 1.8mg/dL, and lactate dehydrogenase was elevated suggesting a hemolytic anemia. However, his reticulocyte index was 0.13, consistent with hypo-proliferation. Direct antithrombin test was also negative. He was transfused 2 units of pack red blood cells and had an appropriate rise in hemoglobin to > 7 g/dL. We continued to work the patient up with multiple viral panels, Leptospirosis, cold agglutinins, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and antinuclear antibodies (ANA) to rule out other causes of his presentation. Flow cytometry cytogenetic analysis revealed no evidence of an acquired clonal abnormality.

### Therapeutic potential of Janus-activated kinase-2 inhibitors for the management of myelofibrosis [^6a456efc]. Clinical Cancer Research (2010). Low credibility.

Myelofibrosis (either primary or postpolycythemia vera/essential thrombocythemia) is a chronic and debilitating myeloproliferative neoplasm for which there is no well-accepted standard of care. Clinical manifestations of this disease (e.g., cytopenias, splenomegaly, bone marrow fibrosis) and constitutional symptoms (e.g., hypercatabolic state, fatigue, night sweats, fever) create significant treatment challenges. For example, progressive splenomegaly increases the risk for more serious clinical sequelae (e.g., portal hypertension, splenic infarction). Myelofibrosis arises from hematopoietic stem cells or early progenitor cells. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis and clinical presentation are poorly understood, delaying the development of effective and targeted treatments. Recent studies have implicated mutations that directly or indirectly lead to the deregulated activation of Janus-activated kinase 2 (JAK2). Appreciation for the activation of JAK2 and the importance of increased levels of circulating proinflammatory cytokines in the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of myelofibrosis has led to novel therapeutic agents targeting JAKs. This review will briefly discuss the origins of the JAK2 hypothesis, the clinical relevance of JAK2 mutations in myelofibrosis, and recent clinical progress in targeting JAKs as a therapeutic intervention for patients with this chronic and debilitating disease.

### Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in children and adolescents [^82031ccd]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical presentation

Patients with HSTCL usually present with acute or subacute constitutional symptoms, including fatigue, fever, and weight loss. Physical examination generally reveals hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly, the degree of which can be quite striking. Unlike other lymphomas, HSTCL rarely presents with palpable peripheral lymphadenopathy. This extranodal distribution may perplex clinicians, prolong workup, and delay definitive diagnosis.

Laboratory evaluation often reveals cytopenias, which may be due to bone marrow involvement, hypersplenism, or an immune-mediated process with or without a cytokine response. Although thrombocytopenia has been suggested as a poor prognostic factor in adults, this association has yet to be proven for children and adolescents with HSTCL. Bone marrow involvement is common in children and adolescents, with estimates as high as 70%. Prescence of peripheral blasts at diagnosis is estimated to occur in 1% to 2% of adult cases. However, data in children and adolescents are restricted to case reports, making its significance unknown. Other frequent laboratory findings include elevated lactate dehydrogenase (reflecting high tumor burden and rapid cell turnover)as well as elevated alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels.

As depicted in case 2, presentation may also include features of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a severe hyperinflammatory syndrome that may further complicate initial workup, diagnosis, and management of HSTCL. HLH may occur in patients with T-cell lymphoma as a paraneoplastic syndrome or secondary phenomenon. For some malignancies copresenting with HLH, immune system dysregulation starts with a viral infection such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), leading to cytokine dysregulation and hemophagocytosis. However, HSTCL is not classically associated with EBV, meaning the neoplastic cells may drive the HLH instead. Activated, malignant γδ T cells can produce interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor α, and interleukin-2 receptor, leading to macrophage and reticulin cell activation, red blood cell phagocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. Secretion of interferon gamma is also directly disruptive to myelopoiesis, which could lead to pancytopenia. Although HLH's copresence with HSTCL has been described in adults, its true frequency has yet to be studied systematically in pediatrics. We strongly advocate for the investigation of an underlying malignancy, such as HSTCL, in patients with HLH of unclear etiology.

### Severe infectious mononucleosis in the older adult: a case report and review of the literature [^3592aad4]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the causative agent for infectious mononucleosis (IM), a diagnosis classically made in adolescence and young adulthood. IM is uncommon later in life generally because of previous exposure. When the disease does affect advanced age groups, diagnostic challenges exist and delays to appropriate treatment may occur.

Case Presentation

An 86-year-old man presented to the emergency department for evaluation of severe generalized weakness for greater than one week. Significant findings in the ED consisted of thrombocytopenia, elevated liver function testing, and atypical lymphocytosis. Infectious Monospot testing was positive. Given his clinical presentation, hospitalization was required. A broad workup in the hospital setting revealed a principal diagnosis of IM based on EBV DNA quantification and EBV IgM positivity. After a weeklong hospital stay, he was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation.

Discussion

This case highlights the importance of considering IM in advanced age groups who are not typically considered classic for the presentation and avoiding diagnostic closure in unrevealing workups. Although IM is rarely reported in patients beyond the third decade of life, our patient's severe fatigue and laboratory findings warranted further evaluation with immunologic studies, clinching the diagnosis.

Conclusion

This report illustrates the need for emergency providers to consider IM in the differential even for older adults given their potential for decompensation.

### Common variable immune deficiency: case studies [^969f7f5e]. Blood (2019). Medium credibility.

Common variable immune deficiency (CVID) is one of the most common congenital immune defects encountered in clinical practice. The condition occurs equally in males and females, and most commonly in the 20- to 40-year-old age group. The diagnosis is made by documenting reduced serum concentrations of immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, and usually IgM, together with loss of protective antibodies. The genetics of this syndrome are complex and are still being unraveled, but the hallmarks for most patients, as with other immune defects, include acute and chronic infections of the sinopulmonary tract. However, other noninfectious autoimmune or inflammatory conditions may also occur in CVID, and indeed these may be the first and only sign that a significant immune defect is present. These manifestations include episodes of immune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, or neutropenia, in addition to splenomegaly, generalized or worrisome lymphadenopathy, and malignancy, especially lymphoma. These issues commonly bring the patient to the attention of hematologists for both evaluation and treatment. This article discusses 3 cases in which patients with CVID had some of these presenting issues and what hematology input was required.

### Biological drivers of clinical phenotype in myelofibrosis [^dc7d0e93]. Leukemia (2023). Medium credibility.

Spectrum of clinical phenotype in myelofibrosis

The heterogeneous nature of MPNs was recognized by Dameshek across the entire spectrum of these diseases, but arguably it is most apparent for patients with MF; in the next sections we explore this theme of clinical heterogeneity within MF particularly focusing upon advanced MF.

The mutational landscape of MF has been better delineated in recent years and most non-driver mutations in MF are also prevalent in MDS and AML. Some authors have suggested that certain cases of MF appear not to be a pure MPN, but instead also have features of MDS – including dysplastic morphology and cytopenias etc. Indeed, the presence of non-driver mutations is reportedly correlated with the likelihood of myelodysplastic features and the severity of MF. This highlights the MF disease spectrum ranging from myelodysplastic with consequent cytopenias to myeloproliferative MF. Other authors have focused upon a different terminology and describe advanced MF using the term "myelodepletive MF". Here the degree of cytopenia associated with the myelodepletive MF phenotype is characterized by severe pancytopenia with low leukocyte count, platelet count, anemia, and frequently requiring transfusions. In contrast, the myeloproliferative MF phenotype is associated with leukocytosis, variable platelet counts, anemia, more frequently massive splenomegaly and a symptom profile associated with abdominal pain and night sweats.

These nosological models of myelodysplastic (mutational/morphological profile) and myelodepletive (thrombocytopenia/anemia) MF are likely not mutually exclusive. Whether the preferred term is cytopenic or myelodepletive, which recognizes a distinction from MDS and the WHO entity MDS with fibrosis, we will explore features of this phenotype in more detail below. These phenotypes are not always perfectly represented in individual studies due to the complex pathophysiology driving the clinical heterogeneity of MF, but instead simply represent a framework in which a spectrum of clinical phenotype can be better appreciated. Additionally, the paradox of atypical megakaryocyte hyperplasia which is a pathognomonic bone marrow feature of MF still underlies the thrombocytopenia overrepresented but not exclusive to the cytopenic MF profile. This is in contrast to the myelodepletive concept that may be best suited to convey a pathobiology that more closely resembles myelodysplastic syndrome.

### Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis – a diagnostic dilemma: two cases and review [^ec148ff4]. Clinical Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a severe inflammatory disorder characterized by activation and proliferation of lymphocytes and histiocytes with cytokine release and uncontrolled hemophagocytosis, especially late in the course of the disease. Clinical features include relapsing fevers, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias, lymphadenopathy, and coagulopathy. The diagnosis can be challenging, as the early signs and symptoms are nonspecific and no specific laboratory tests exist. This syndrome is frequently not recognized and has a significant mortality rate. Typical scenarios in which HLH should be considered include mononucleosis (fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy) in an infant or young child, aseptic meningitis associated with cytopenias, or a viral syndrome-like illness with cytopenias and lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly, for example. Our approach includes measuring a ferritin level as a screening tool early in the course of such an illness. Two cases of HLH are reviewed, illustrating the frequent complexity of these cases and potential pitfalls to making a prompt diagnosis.

Epidemiology, clinical features, and presentations

The annual incidence of primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is 0.4–1.4 per 100,000 population and shows a predilection for older males, although younger patients can be affected. Of the MPNs, PMF is the least common but is associated with poorer survival, approximately 2 to 5 years upon diagnosis and symptom onset. Patients may be asymptomatic and present following detection of incidental radiological findings or through discovery of anaemia, thrombocytosis, or thrombocytopaenia. In symptomatic patients, the clinical presentation varies from constitutional symptoms to cardiovascular complications related to severe anaemia and thromboembolic events. Up to 10% of patients experience a thromboembolic event, most commonly venous thromboembolism. Splenomegaly is an inevitable outcome and may lead to splenic infarction, haemorrhage, splanchnic vein thrombosis, portal hypertension, or mass effect symptoms. There is also a small risk of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia.

### Myelofibrosis management in routine clinical practice with a focus on patients with cytopenias: recommendations from a global consensus group [^14af45e9]. Leukemia (2024). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

Myelofibrosis (MF) is a Philadelphia chromosome (BCR::ABL1)-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm, a hallmark of which is progressive deposition of fibrotic tissue in bone marrow. Clinical manifestations of MF often include splenomegaly, cytopenias (such as severe anemia), and extramedullary hematopoiesis. The Janus kinase inhibitor (JAKi) therapies ruxolitinib (RUX) and fedratinib (FED) have demonstrated significant clinical efficacy in splenic volume reduction and symptom improvement, but they may induce treatment-related anemia and thrombocytopenia. Other JAKi options include pacritinib (PAC), which received FDA approval in 2022 for patients with MF and severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 50 × 10 9 /l), and momelotinib (MMB), which received FDA and EMA approval in 2023/2024, respectively, for patients with MF and anemia. Clinical trials with JAKis in MF are summarized in reference.

### Recommendations for the management of the haematological and onco-haematological aspects of gaucher disease [^f350283e]. British Journal of Haematology (2007). Low credibility.

Leucopenia

Leucopenia, which may result from bone marrow infiltration by Gaucher cells and/or hypersplenism, rarely requires intervention in Gaucher patients. Both asplenic and spleen-intact Gaucher patients can suffer repeated pyogenic infections thought to related to deficient neutrophil function rather than decreased neutrophil counts and/or compromised monocyte phagocytic and respiratory burst capacity caused by glucocerebroside accumulation. Splenectomized patients (from any cause) have an increased and ongoing risk of sepsis. Increased white blood cell counts may also occur in Gaucher patients after splenectomy and may signal other pathologies, such as the development of lymphoproliferative disorders.

Therapeutic goals for cytopenia

Therapeutic goals for imiglucerase suggest that haemoglobin levels should be restored to normal or near normal levels within 12–24 months of starting treatment (in the absence of iron deficiency or any other co-morbidity associated with anaemia). Associated aims are to reduce the need for blood transfusions and to ameliorate anaemia-related symptoms such as fatigue and, in older patients, dyspnoea and angina.

Thrombocytopenia, independent of other symptoms, is defined by platelet counts of < 150 × 10 9 /l. Thrombocytopenia sufficient to justify initiation of imiglucerase therapy is defined by repeated platelet counts of < 100 × 10 9 /l. Therapeutic goals aim to prevent spontaneous bleeding, whether caused by low platelet numbers, platelet defects or coagulation abnormalities. Normal platelet counts should be achieved in splenectomized patients within 1 year, and low to normal platelet counts in patients with moderate thrombocytopenia within 2 years. For patients with severe thrombocytopenia, the goal is to sustain increases in platelet counts although complete normalization may be impossible. Some patients have a highly compromised platelet response because of initial massive splenomegaly and or severe bone marrow infiltration. The avoidance of splenectomy is an important treatment goal in Gaucher disease as splenectomy increases susceptibility to infection, may exacerbate bone disease, hepatic complications and/or pulmonary disease.

Deficiencies in coagulation factors have been partially corrected following 12 months of enzyme treatment. Diminished platelet function has also been shown to improve with imiglucerase therapy although the mechanisms involved are unclear. In vitro evidence suggests that high glucocerebroside concentrations do not directly influence platelet aggregation function.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, more specifically with respect to patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia or immune thrombocytopenia, iwCLL 2018 guidelines recommend to treat immune thrombocytopenia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia as a single abnormality caused by CLL initially with corticosteroids and not initially with chemotherapy or targeted agents. Rituximab, splenectomy, IVIG, and/or immunosuppressive therapy are the second-line treatment options for autoimmune hemolytic anemia.

Clinical characteristics

GD (ORPHA:355) is characterized by hepato‐splenomegaly, cytopenias, sometimes severe bone lesions, and, in some cases, neurologic lesions. Three main presentations are classically described, respectively, as Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3.

Type 1 GD (MIM #230800, ORPHA:77259) is defined by the absence of any initial neurological involvement. It is the most frequent form of GD (prevalence 90%–95%), the diagnosis of which can be made at any age. Type 1 GD can impair some daily activities but is rarely lethal. Clinical presentation is highly heterogeneous, rarely asymptomatic. The median age at diagnosis is between 10 and 20 years old, depending on reports. Fatigue is frequent (50%), impacting school and socio‐professional life. In children, growth or pubertal retardation can be noted. Although it is a less characteristic sign than in acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (formerly Niemann–Pick disease type B, MIM #607616, ORPHA:77293), it can be noted that high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels may be reduced in GD.

Splenomegaly is present in more than 90% of the patients, sometimes massive and symptomatic. It can be complicated by splenic infarct, but spleen rupture is exceptional. It is important to consider GD when facing a splenomegaly without obvious etiology, especially if it is associated with thrombocytopenia, high ferritin, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, or monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Diagnostic splenectomy should be avoided as it may lead to GD aggravation and is, anyway, not devoid of other risks regardless of the GD context.

About 60%–80% of patients also present with hepatomegaly, rarely evolving toward fibrosis or cirrhosis.

Hemorrhages (i.e. spontaneous bruises, epistaxis, dental surgery‐related bleeding), rarely severe, can be present at diagnosis. They are related to thrombocytopenia (60%–90% of the cases), sometimes aggravated by platelet function defect and occasionally coagulation anomalies.

### Low-dose thalidomide ameliorates cytopenias and splenomegaly in myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia: a phase II trial [^71481cbe]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

A phase II dose-escalation trial was conducted to ascertain low-dose thalidomide safety and response in patients with advanced myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM).

Patients and Methods

Thalidomide was administered together with current therapy to 63 patients, starting at 50 mg daily and increasing to 400 mg as tolerated.

Results

Half of the patients sustained daily doses more than 100 mg and the drop-out rate was 51% at 6 months: the drop-out rate was lower in patients with high baseline fatigue score. At efficacy analysis, anemia was ameliorated in 22% of the patients and transfusions were eliminated in 39% of transfusion-dependent patients. Platelet count increased by 50 x 10(9)/L or more in 22% of patients with an initial count lower than 100 x 10(9)/L. Splenomegaly decreased by more than 50% of the initial size in 19% of patients. Reduction of an overall disease severity score occurred in 31% of patients and was associated with a significant reduction of fatigue. Disease severity amelioration was independently predicted by a high baseline myeloproliferative index (ie, large splenomegaly, thrombocytosis, or leukocytosis).

Conclusion

Low-dose thalidomide displays an acceptable toxicity profile and provides an objective and subjective advantage to a relevant portion of MMM patients.

### An 8-year-old boy with fever, splenomegaly, and pancytopenia [^218c5fd6]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

An 8-year-old boy with no significant past medical history presented to his pediatrician with 5 days of fever, diffuse abdominal pain, and pallor. The pediatrician referred the patient to the emergency department (ED), out of concern for possible malignancy. Initial vital signs indicated fever, tachypnea, and tachycardia. Physical examination was significant for marked abdominal distension, hepatosplenomegaly, and abdominal tenderness in the right upper and lower quadrants. Initial laboratory studies were notable for pancytopenia as well as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis showed massive splenomegaly. The only significant history of travel was immigration from Albania 10 months before admission. The patient was admitted to a tertiary care children's hospital and was evaluated by hematology-oncology, infectious disease, genetics, and rheumatology subspecialty teams. Our multidisciplinary panel of experts will discuss the evaluation of pancytopenia with apparent multiorgan involvement and the diagnosis and appropriate management of a rare disease.

Myelofibrosis (MF) with thrombocytopenia — treatment options by platelet count are outlined as follows. For higher-risk MF with platelet count < 50 x 10^9/L in patients who are not transplant candidates or for whom transplant is not currently feasible, momelotinib is a category 2B, other recommended regimens, and enrollment in an appropriate clinical trial is also an option; additionally, the use of ruxolitinib at a lower dose (5 mg twice daily) has shown some efficacy with improvements even in patients with low platelet counts at baseline (50–100 x 10^9/L). For patients with platelet count ≥ 50 x 10^9/L and symptomatic splenomegaly and/or constitutional symptoms who are not transplant candidates or for whom transplant is not currently feasible, options include enrollment in a clinical trial, ruxolitinib (category 1), fedratinib (category 1), momelotinib, or pacritinib (category 2B). Severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 50 x 10^9/L) is reported to be a higher risk category with more anemia and leukopenia, and patients with platelet count < 50 x 10^9/L experience a greater symptom burden and might benefit from symptomatically guided treatment options.

### The differential diagnosis and bone marrow evaluation of new-onset pancytopenia [^70d65387]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

New-onset pancytopenia can be caused by a wide variety of etiologies, leading to a diagnostic dilemma. These etiologies range from congenital bone marrow failure to marrow space-occupying lesions, infection, and peripheral destruction, to name a few. Bone marrow examination, in addition to a detailed clinical history, is often required for an accurate diagnosis. The purpose of this review is to provide a brief overview of many of the causes of new-onset pancytopenia in adults and children, with emphasis on bone marrow findings and recommendations of additional testing and clinical evaluation when needed, with the overall aim of aiding the pathologist's role as a consultant to the patient's treating physician.

### EBV associated epiglottitis in an immunocompetent child [^c3d236d5]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Primary EBV infections are common in young infants and children, often occurring without symptoms. When symptoms do present, they can include otitis media, diarrhea, abdominal issues, upper respiratory infections, and infectious mononucleosis (IM). In our patient, the primary EBV infection manifested as subacute epiglottitis, an upper respiratory infection, but also shared similarities with IM, which typically presents as a generalized systemic illness.

Infectious mononucleosis (IM) is a well-known acute manifestation of Epstein-Barr virus infection, typically starting with fever, fatigue, and pharyngitis, often accompanied by tonsillar exudate. Common physical exam findings include generalized lymphadenopathy (90% of cases), splenomegaly (50%), and hepatomegaly (10%). Lymphadenopathy frequently affects the anterior and posterior cervical nodes and submandibular nodes, and less often the axillary and inguinal nodes. Most patients (> 90%) have leukocytosis ranging from 10,000 to 20,000 cells/µL, with at least two-thirds being lymphocytes, and atypical lymphocytes making up 20–40% of the total. Mild thrombocytopenia (50,000–200,000 platelets/µL) occurs in over half of the patients. Hepatic transaminase levels are mildly elevated in about 75% of uncomplicated cases, usually without symptoms or jaundice. A rare but serious complication is upper airway obstruction due to massive tonsillar enlargement and mucosal edema. Our patient had fever, bilateral anterior cervical and submandibular lymphadenopathy, atypical lymphocytes, and mild thrombocytopenia. However, due to the avoidance of direct inspection of the oral cavity, we did not observe any tonsillar exudates. The patient did not have hepatosplenomegaly, lymphocytosis, or elevated transaminases. Unlike infectious mononucleosis (IM), the epiglottis was the primary site of airway compromise.

### Biomarkers in the diagnosis of lysosomal storage disorders: proteins, lipids, and inhibodies [^d2bf2601]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Gaucher disease

A prominent LSD is Gaucher disease (Beutler et al; Aerts et al.). Brady and co-workers first showed that the primary defect in Gaucher disease is a marked deficiency in activity of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (Brady et al.). Deficiencies in glucocerebrosidase result in accumulation of its lipid substrate glucosylceramide in the lysosomal compartment of macrophages throughout the body. Different phenotypes (types 1, 2, and 3) are generally recognized and are differentiated on the basis of the presence or absence of neurological symptoms. Whether a strict division in three different phenotypes is still valid has been the subject of debate, as there are an increasing number of reports on neurological manifestations in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease. However, the neurological signs and symptoms in type 1 Gaucher disease are of a totally different kind from and, in the majority of cases, of much less severity than, the signs and symptoms associated with types 2 and 3 disease (Biegstraaten et al.). It has also become apparent that complete deficiencies in glucocerebrosidase activity occur, resulting in major skin permeability abnormalities with lethal consequences either prenatally or shortly after birth (Sidransky). The most common Gaucher phenotype is non-neuronopathic type 1 manifestation, with a highly variable age of onset and severity. Even spontaneous disease regression has been observed in some relatively mildly affected type 1 Gaucher patients (Boomsma et al.). Characteristic symptoms include splenomegaly with anemia and thrombocytopenia, hepatomegaly, and bone disease. Anemia may contribute to chronic fatigue. Thrombocytopenia and prolonged clotting times can lead to an increased bleeding tendency. Atypical bone pain, pathological fractures, avascular necrosis, and extremely painful bone crises may also have a great impact on quality of life. Gammopathies and metabolic abnormalities such as insulin resistance and lipoprotein abnormalities are encountered in type 1 Gaucher patients (Langeveld et al; Wennekes et al; de Fost et al.). Type 1 Gaucher disease is relatively common in all ethnic groups. It is prevalent among Ashkenazi Jews, with a carrier frequency as high as about 1 in 15 and an incidence of about 1 in 1,000. The most common mutation in the glucocerebrosidase gene of Caucasians, including Ashkenazi Jews, encodes the amino acid substitution N370S. The heteroallelic presence of the N370S mutation is always associated with a non-neuronopathic course (Ohashi et al; van Weely et al.). Some, but not all, homozygotes for the N370S mutation develop significant clinical symptoms (Beutler et al; Aerts et al.). Twin studies and the poor predictive power of genotype–phenotype investigations in Gaucher disease have clearly pointed out that epigenetic factors also play a key role in Gaucher disease manifestation (Biegstraaten et al.).

American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2019 immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) guideline — corticosteroids versus observation in newly diagnosed adults: In adults with newly diagnosed ITP and a platelet count of < 30 × 10^9/L who are asymptomatic or have minor mucocutaneous bleeding, the ASH guideline panel suggests corticosteroids rather than management with observation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects), with a remark that there may be a subset for whom observation might be appropriate based on severity of thrombocytopenia, additional comorbidities, use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, need for upcoming procedures, and patients' values and preferences. For patients with a platelet count of ≥ 30 × 10^9/L who are asymptomatic or have minor mucocutaneous bleeding, the ASH guideline panel recommends against corticosteroids and in favor of management with observation (strong recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects), noting that for patients at the lower end of this threshold; for those with additional comorbidities, anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, upcoming procedures; and for elderly patients (> 60 years old), treatment with corticosteroids may be appropriate. A good practice statement specifies that the treating physician should ensure that the patient is adequately monitored for potential corticosteroid side effects and should conduct an assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (depression, fatigue, mental status, etc) while patients are receiving corticosteroids.

Visceral leishmaniasis — Among symptomatic people, the incubation period typically ranges from weeks to months, and illness onset can be abrupt or gradual. Clinical manifestations include fever, hepatosplenomegaly (especially splenomegaly), night sweats, weight loss, and possible lymphadenopathy. Laboratory findings characteristic of VL include pancytopenia (anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia), high total protein, low albumin, and hypergammaglobulinemia. If untreated, severe cases typically are fatal, and latent infection can clinically manifest years to decades after exposure in people who become immunocompromised through HIV infection, biologic immunomodulatory therapy, or immunosuppressive therapy.

Visceral leishmaniasis in people with HIV — common clinical and laboratory features include fever (65% to 100%), systemic malaise (70% to 90%), splenomegaly (usually moderate) (54% to 90%), hepatomegaly without splenomegaly (34% to 85%), hepatosplenomegaly (68% to 73%), lymphadenopathy (12% to 57%), and pancytopenia (50% to 80%). Anemia is usually marked, with < 10 g hemoglobin/dL (50% to 100%); leukopenia is moderate, with < 2,400 leukocytes/μL (56% to 95%); and thrombocytopenia is usually present (52% to 93%). Splenomegaly is less pronounced than in immunocompetent patients, and with more profound CD4 cell depletion atypical manifestations can involve mucosa, gastrointestinal tract, serosal cavities, lungs, skin, and esophagus; esophageal involvement can lead to dysphagia and odynophagia and must be distinguished from candidiasis, and amastigote infiltration of the duodenum often presents as chronic diarrhea; nonulcerative cutaneous lesions mimicking Kaposi sarcoma and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis have been described, although the presence of Leishmania amastigotes in skin lesions does not prove causation.

### Acute leukaemoid reaction following cardiac surgery [^9e76f311]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) is an atypical myeloproliferative disorder characterized by an absolute peripheral blood monocyte count of greater than 1.0 × 10 9 /L, with evidence of both effective and ineffective haematopoiesis. The aetiology of CMML is complex and incompletely understood. It is twice as common in men, usually presenting in the seventh or eighth decades. Late clinical features include fatigue, weight loss, fever and night sweats, splenomegaly and hepatomegaly, although it may present as a chance finding on blood analysis. The bone marrow is usually hypercellular with granulocytic proliferation and it can be differentiated from classical chronic myeloid leukaemia by the high monocyte count and absence of a Philadelphia chromosome. Despite best medical therapy, the outcome remains poor with median survival less than two years from the time of diagnosis. Individual prognosis is difficult to predict, although approximately 20% of patients progress to acute myeloid leukaemia.

Cardiac surgery has been reported in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, myelodysplasia and other malignant haematological disorders but data on CMML are limited. We present a case of previously undiagnosed CMML who developed fatal complications following cardiac surgery.

### Are clonal T-cell large granular lymphocytes to blame for unexplained haematological abnormalities? [^6cce4f9e]. British Journal of Haematology (2007). Low credibility.

Abnormalities diagnosed on routine blood work, such as mild neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia and relative lymphocytosis, often have obscure aetiologies. A series of 30 patients were evaluated for various unexplained haematological abnormalities between 1997 and 2005, and found to have circulating monoclonal T-cell large granular lymphocytes (T-LGL). These patients fit the diagnosis of T-cell clonopathy of unknown significance (TCUS), which may represent a clinical spectrum of clonal T-LGL proliferation. Our patients were characterised by a complete absence of severe neutropenia (< 0.5 x 10(9)/l), absence of recurrent neutropenic infection (0%), negative rheumatoid serology (0%) and a low incidence of constitutional symptoms (20%). This overall asymptomatic clinical presentation appeared to be different from other previously reported series of TCUS or T-LGL leukaemia who typically had symptomatology and required treatment. Our series of 30 patients represented the benign end of the spectrum of clonal T-LGL proliferation, and might reflect diagnosis at earlier stages of the condition relative to other reported series. TCUS may be a heterogeneous and under-diagnosed condition. This study further broadens our understanding of the clinical and laboratory manifestations of indolent clonal T-cell proliferation, and raises our awareness of this condition. We suggest that TCUS should be considered in the diagnostic evaluation of unexplained haematological problems.
