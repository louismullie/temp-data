## Question

Sciatica pain outpatient clinic

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about outpatient management of sciatica pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about diagnostic confirmation and red flags. Then, I should verify the natural history and prognosis to set expectations. Next, I will review first-line conservative care and its evidence. After that, I need to check pharmacologic options and their limitations. Then, I will examine when and how to escalate to injections or surgery, including timing and cost-effectiveness. Finally, I should consider special populations, shared decision-making, and a practical algorithm, while continuously validating claims against the cited evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical diagnosis and screen for red flags before committing to any treatment pathway, because misclassification and missed emergencies drive harm and inappropriate care. Sciatica is best characterized by unilateral leg pain radiating below the knee in a dermatomal pattern, often worse than back pain, with possible sensory changes, positive straight leg raise, and neurologic deficits; I should double-check that these features are present to avoid conflating somatic referred pain with radiculopathy, and I must actively exclude cauda equina, infection, malignancy, fracture, and progressive motor deficit before proceeding conservatively [^111TFJhh] [^112sULD9] [^113KCa4R].

> Wait, let me verify the natural history so I don't over-treat a self-limiting condition. Most patients with acute sciatica improve substantially within 2–4 weeks, and up to 80–95% recover satisfactorily by 6–12 months regardless of surgery, though 20–30% may have persistent symptoms beyond a year. I should communicate this clearly to temper expectations and avoid premature escalation, especially in the first 6–8 weeks [^113KCa4R] [^114fxZpX] [^111F2Kgh].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about imaging. I need to ensure I apply the right timing. Routine imaging is not indicated for uncomplicated sciatica without red flags, and early MRI rarely changes management. Imaging becomes appropriate if symptoms persist beyond 6–8 weeks despite conservative care, if there is diagnostic uncertainty, or if procedural or surgical planning is needed, with MRI preferred over CT for soft tissue detail and without radiation exposure [^112sULD9] [^113KCa4R].

> Next, I should review first-line conservative care and verify what actually helps. Advice to stay active is reasonable and avoids the harms of bed rest, though its effect on sciatica-specific outcomes is modest at best. Structured exercise programs show small short-term advantages over advice alone for leg pain, and early physical therapy within 90 days of onset improves disability and patient-reported success at 6–12 months compared with usual care. I should confirm that these benefits are clinically meaningful in context and counsel on expectations accordingly [^111neChg] [^116mLF2P] [^111KeHnR].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought physiotherapy had strong evidence across the board. Let me reconsider. Contemporary systematic reviews and meta-analyses show no consistent benefit of physiotherapy over minimal or substantial controls for pain or disability in heterogeneous sciatica populations, with high risk of bias and heterogeneity limiting conclusions; however, physiotherapy may outperform minimal interventions for long-term pain in some analyses, and subgroup signals suggest mechanism-based or combined approaches could be more effective, so I should individualize and avoid overpromising outcomes [^11218GHJ] [^113EPKBn] [^113bsyoP].

> I will now examine pharmacologic options and I should double-check their effect sizes and risks. NSAIDs have, at best, small and uncertain benefits for pain and global improvement, with increased adverse events versus placebo; a recent naproxen RCT showed a statistically significant but likely clinically unimportant reduction in leg pain over 10 days; pregabalin failed to outperform placebo in moderate-to-severe sciatica in the PRECISE trial, though a small crossover study suggested gabapentin may outperform pregabalin with fewer adverse effects; opioids have no supportive high-quality evidence and should generally be avoided outside exceptional, short-term scenarios; overall, I need to ensure medication use is cautious, time-limited, and aligned with patient risk profiles [^112sWKPY] [^116CxuVV] [^114Voi5Z] [^112aoKSg] [^111jfPh3] [^115rtBDN].

> Let me think about when to escalate beyond conservative care and how to choose between injections and surgery. For persistent, disabling leg pain beyond about 6–12 weeks despite active conservative management, transforaminal epidural steroid injections can provide short-term relief of leg pain and disability with small average effects, and may serve as a bridge or diagnostic step; surgery, typically microdiscectomy, yields faster relief of leg pain and improved disability in the short to medium term but converges to similar outcomes by 6–24 months compared with non-surgical care, so the decision should weigh the value of faster recovery against risks and costs; in cost-conscious systems, stepped care beginning with non-opioids and injections tends to be more cost-effective than immediate surgery, and the NERVES trial suggests TFESI is a reasonable first invasive option with surgery reserved for non-responders [^1128dqir] [^114fxZpX] [^112unCo8] [^1153ozow] [^114RNjK4].

> But wait, what if the patient prioritizes rapid relief and has a clear surgical indication? Should I reconsider timing. Early surgery achieves faster pain relief and perceived recovery without improving long-term outcomes compared with prolonged conservative care, and patients with more severe baseline leg pain and disability may benefit more from earlier intervention; I should confirm concordant MRI pathology and discuss trade-offs explicitly, including the possibility of delayed surgery if conservative care fails and the lack of long-term superiority of surgery in many trials [^114fxZpX] [^111F2Kgh] [^1117vs3T].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and contexts. In older adults, I should prioritize safety with NSAIDs and consider renal and cardiovascular risk. In patients with predominant neuropathic features, a cautious trial of gabapentin may be reasonable given the small crossover signal, while acknowledging the negative PRECISE results. In occupational health settings, early active management and ergonomic counseling may mitigate work disability. And in systems with constrained resources, stepped care with explicit timelines and reassessment points helps reduce unwarranted variation and delays [^112aoKSg] [^114Voi5Z] [^1153tXhW].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of shared decision-making because preferences meaningfully shape outcomes. Patients often desire diagnostic certainty via imaging and may prefer faster relief through invasive options, whereas clinicians may be comfortable with clinical diagnosis and watchful waiting; aligning these perspectives through clear communication about natural history, probabilities of benefit, and risks reduces decisional conflict and improves satisfaction, and I should document goals, preferences, and decisional capacity at each step [^112jSf5S] [^111fahzD] [^117YC1dX].

> Let me outline a practical, evidence-aligned algorithm and I will double-check each branch against the data. Start with clinical diagnosis confirmation and red flag screening; provide education on favorable natural history and advice to stay active; initiate a structured exercise program or early physical therapy within 90 days; use NSAIDs short-term if no contraindications, consider a time-limited gabapentin trial for suspected neuropathic pain, and avoid routine opioids; reassess at 6–8 weeks and, if not improved, obtain MRI and specialist referral; offer TFESI as the first invasive step for persistent radicular pain, reserving microdiscectomy for refractory cases or those prioritizing rapid relief with a clear surgical target; throughout, revisit goals, monitor for adverse effects, and adjust the plan based on response and patient preferences [^112sULD9] [^111KeHnR] [^1128dqir] [^114RNjK4] [^112unCo8].

> Finally, I should confirm that my recommendations acknowledge uncertainty and are proportionate to evidence quality. Much of the physiotherapy and pharmacologic literature suffers from heterogeneity and risk of bias, and even surgical evidence is largely nonblinded with crossover, so I must communicate probabilistic benefits, emphasize shared decision-making, and remain open to emerging mechanism-based stratification that may better match treatments to patient phenotypes in the future [^11218GHJ] [^114fgkNq] [^114KBNkX].

Outpatient sciatica care should follow a **stepped, conservative-first approach** [^111dfzmK] with **early activity and selective imaging** [^112sULD9] to balance symptom control, function, and costs [^1153ozow]. Most patients improve within 6–12 weeks [^114L4it6]; persistent or severe cases may benefit from **epidural steroids** [^1128dqir] or **surgery** [^114fxZpX], but long-term outcomes often converge [^1117vs3T], so shared decision-making is essential [^117YC1dX].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Sciatica presents with **radiating leg pain** [^111TFJhh] — typically unilateral, worse than back pain, and often accompanied by sensory changes, weakness, or reflex changes [^111TFJhh]. Diagnosis is **clinical**, supported by a positive straight leg raise or crossed straight leg raise, and imaging is reserved for red flags or persistent symptoms [^112sULD9].

---

## Initial conservative management (0–6 weeks)

### Patient education and reassurance

Explain the **natural history** [^113KCa4R] — most patients improve within 6–12 weeks — and emphasize staying active [^111G3YM5] while avoiding prolonged bed rest [^111neChg].

---

### Physical therapy

Use **early physical therapy** [^111KeHnR] with exercise and manual therapy to improve function and reduce disability; structured exercise offers small, short-term benefits over advice alone [^116mLF2P].

---

### Pharmacological management

- **NSAIDs**: First-line for pain and inflammation; modest benefits and gastrointestinal risks [^112sWKPY] [^116CxuVV].
- **Acetaminophen**: Alternative for mild pain or NSAID intolerance.
- **Muscle relaxants**: Short-term use for severe muscle spasm.
- **Gabapentinoids**: Limited benefit; pregabalin is not superior to placebo for acute/chronic sciatica [^114Voi5Z] [^115rtBDN].

---

## Intermediate management (6–12 weeks)

### Imaging and specialist referral

Obtain **MRI** if symptoms persist beyond 6 weeks or if red flags are present [^113KCa4R], and refer to a spine specialist for severe or refractory cases.

---

### Interventional procedures

Consider **epidural steroid injections** for persistent radicular pain after conservative care; they provide short-term relief but limited long-term benefit [^1128dqir] [^114RNjK4].

---

## Long-term management (> 12 weeks)

### Surgical intervention

Microdiscectomy offers faster relief than prolonged conservative care, but **long-term outcomes are similar** [^114fxZpX] [^1117vs3T]; reserve surgery for persistent, disabling pain with concordant imaging [^115VyQ8n] [^111F2Kgh].

---

### Multidisciplinary pain management

Use **multidisciplinary programs** for chronic sciatica, combining physical therapy, psychological support, and pain management strategies [^113THNM4].

---

## Cost-effectiveness considerations

A **stepped care approach** — starting with non-opioid medications and conservative therapy — is most cost-effective [^1153ozow], whereas early surgery is generally not cost-effective unless rapid relief is prioritized [^114RNjK4].

---

## Patient preferences and shared decision-making

Patients value **rapid relief and diagnostic certainty** [^notfound]; shared decision-making improves satisfaction and adherence [^notfound].

## Summary of outpatient sciatica management

| **Phase** | **Interventions** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| 0–6 weeks | - Education <br/> - Activity <br/> - PT <br/> - NSAIDs | Conservative care and natural recovery [^113KCa4R] |
| 6–12 weeks | - MRI <br/> - Specialist referral <br/> - Epidural injections | Persistent symptoms and targeted relief [^114L4it6] |
| > 12 weeks | - Surgery <br/> - Multidisciplinary care | Chronic management and functional improvement [^113THNM4] |

---

Outpatient sciatica management should be **stepped and conservative-first** [^111dfzmK], with **selective imaging** [^112sULD9] and escalation based on persistence and severity; most patients improve with conservative care, and long-term outcomes of surgery often match conservative treatment, so shared decision-making is key [^1117vs3T].

Methods

Data sources and searches

We used the review methods advocated by the editorial board of the Cochrane Back Review Group. This study searched the following databases from the earliest records to 15 March 2010: International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials, CINAHL, and LILACS. Key words related to randomised controlled trial, sciatica, and drugs terms in addition to subject subheadings and word truncations specific for each database were used (see appendix on bmj.com). Electronic searches were supplemented by hand searching reference lists of eligible clinical trials. Our search was restricted to trials published in English, German, Dutch, Portuguese, and Spanish. One reviewer screened all relevant titles and abstracts and excluded clearly irrelevant papers, leaving 173 potentially relevant papers. Two reviewers independently evaluated the full reports for eligibility. Disagreements were resolved by discussion.

Study selection

Studies were eligible if they were randomised controlled trials evaluating single or any combination of analgesic or adjuvant pain drugs. For the purposes of this review, we focused on pharmacological interventions that could be administered in primary care settings, which include drugs administered via oral, topical, or parental route (that is, intramuscular injection and intravenous bolus). We excluded trials evaluating procedures that require imaging assistance and the monitoring of anaesthesia monitoring capabilities (for example, epidural, extradural, and intradiscal injections) or that require an extended period of time to be administered with monitoring of the patient's vital signs (for example, intravenous infusion). Eligible comparisons included no treatment, placebo, or other treatment options (for example, other pharmacological treatment, surgery, epidural injections, or other conservative treatment).

### Are combined conservative interventions effective in reducing pain, disability and / or global rating of pain in people with sciatica with known neuropathic pain mechanisms? [^113bsyoP]. European Spine Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

National Clinical Guidelines recommend an integrated combination of conservative management strategies for sciatica. However, the efficacy of such combinations have not been established. The purpose of this systemic review with meta-analysis was to determine the efficacy of combined conservative (non-pharmacological) compared to single interventions for people with sciatica with a confirmed neuropathic mechanism.

Methods

The systematic review was registered on PROSPERO CRD42023464011. The databases included were the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL (EBSCO), Embase, PubMed, Scopus, APA PsycINFO, and grey literature sources from inception until January 2024. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of combined non-pharmacological interventions in comparison to a control intervention among individuals with sciatica of a neuropathic origin identified using diagnostic or clinical tests. Primary outcomes were back pain, leg pain, and disability. The secondary outcome was global rating of change. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment (using Cochrane ROB2) were assessed by two reviewers. Meta-analysis was performed with a random effects model with inverse variance weighting used for the metanalysis using SPSS v 29.

Results

3,370 articles were identified, of which 6 were included. Risk of bias was high in one study and had some concerns in the remaining 5 studies for each outcome measure. There was evidence of efficacy for combined interventions for back pain in the short-and long-term (SMD -0.56 (95% CI -0.91, -0.22, p = 0.01, I² = 0.2; SMD -0.44 (95% CI -0.79, -0.1, p = 0.03, I² = 0.00), and for disability in the short term (SMD -0.48 (95% CI -0.92, -0.04, p = 0.04, I² = 0.72). There was no evidence of efficacy for leg pain at any time point ((short term SMD -0.45 (95% CI -0.91, 0.02, p = 0.06, I² = 0.65), medium term (SMD -0.29 (95% CI -1.12, 0.54, p = 0.35, I² = 0.82), long term (SMD -0.40 (95% CI -1.23, 0.44, p = 0.18, I² = 0.57). Certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate.

Conclusion

There are few studies that have combined conservative (non-pharmacological) interventions for the management of sciatica with a neuropathic component pain mechanism, as recommended by National Clinical Guidelines. This review indicates that combining conservative (no-pharmacological) management strategies appeared more effective than single interventions for the outcomes of low back pain in the short and long term, and for disability in the short term, but not for leg pain at any time point. The overall low certainty of evidence, suggests that future studies with more robust methodologies are needed.

ASIPP Epidural Guidelines — comparative effectiveness of epidural injections for sciatica and chronic pain: A network meta-analysis of management strategies for sciatica reviewing 122 relevant studies and 21 treatment strategies showed a statistically significant improvement with epidural injections, and a comparative network meta-analysis found that epidural steroid with local anesthetic was superior to epidural steroid without local anesthetic and to intramuscular steroid; subcutaneous antitumor necrosis factor-α (anti-TNF-α) was superior to epidural local spinal anesthetic at reducing pain, but epidural steroids produced superior reductions in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores compared to subcutaneous anti-TNF-α. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials reported after review of 73 trials that adding corticosteroids to local anesthetic had only small benefits with a potential for harm and no meaningful improvement in pain scores or duration of pain relief, and the authors recommended that clinical decisions should consider the potential for harm with steroids and the therapeutic benefit by the local anesthetic alone; additionally, a prior systematic review of 4 randomized trials was rated very low in methodologic quality, and despite numerous systematic reviews there have not been guidelines systematically developed to assess clinical and cost effectiveness of epidural injections, including percutaneous adhesiolysis, in managing spinal pain.

The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Summary

Background

The optimal invasive treatment for sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc remains controversial, with a paucity of evidence for use of non-surgical treatments such as transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI) over surgical microdiscectomy. We aimed to investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of these options for management of radicular pain secondary to herniated lumbar disc.

Methods

We did a pragmatic, multicentre, phase 3, open-label, randomised controlled trial at 11 spinal units across the UK. Eligible patients were aged 16–65 years, had MRI-confirmed non-emergency sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc with symptom duration between 6 weeks and 12 months, and had leg pain that was not responsive to non-invasive management. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either TFESI or surgical microdiscectomy by an online randomisation system that was stratified by centre with random permuted blocks. The primary outcome was Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODQ) score at 18 weeks. All randomly assigned participants who completed a valid ODQ at baseline and at 18 weeks were included in the analysis. Safety analysis included all treated participants. Cost-effectiveness was estimated from the EuroQol-5D-5L, Hospital Episode Statistics, medication usage, and self-reported resource-use data. This trial was registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN04820368, and EudraCT, number 2014–002751–25.

Findings

Between March 6, 2015, and Dec 21, 2017, 163 (15%) of 1055 screened patients were enrolled, with 80 participants (49%) randomly assigned to the TFESI group and 83 participants (51%) to the surgery group. At week 18, ODQ scores were 30·02 (SD 24·38) for 63 assessed patients in the TFESI group and 22·30 (19·83) for 61 assessed patients in the surgery group. Mean improvement was 24·52 points (18·89) for the TFESI group and 26·74 points (21·35) for the surgery group, with an estimated treatment difference of −4·25 (95% CI −11·09 to 2·59; p = 0·22). There were four serious adverse events in four participants associated with surgery, and none with TFESI. Compared with TFESI, surgery had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £38 737 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, and a 0·17 probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year.

Interpretation

For patients with sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc, with symptom duration of up to 12 months, TFESI should be considered as a first invasive treatment option. Surgery is unlikely to be a cost-effective alternative to TFESI.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114cxeYD]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Fig 5
Mean differences (95% CI) for disability in trials assessing the effectiveness of discectomy versus non-surgical treatment. Disability is expressed on a 0–100 scale. Studies are ordered by weight. SE = standard error; CI = confidence interval; IV = inverse variance

Five trials reported outcomes after 12 months. At 24 months, discectomy did not reduce leg pain (−1.1 (−3.6 to 1.4)) or disability (−1.5 (−4.3 to 1.3)) compared with non-surgical treatment. Similar findings were also observed at months 36, 48, 60, and 96 (fig 2, fig 3, fig 4, fig 5).

Secondary outcomes

Five trials reported findings for back pain. Compared with non-surgical treatment, evidence was of very low certainty that discectomy did not reduce back pain at the immediate term (medium difference −6.8 (95% confidence interval −15.3 to 1.6)) and long term (−7.0 (−15.4 to 1.5)), but did so at the short term (−11.0 (−19.6 to −2.5)) and medium term (−10.2 (−18.7 to −1.7); supplemental file 12).

Five trialsreported outcomes for quality of life and fourreported treatment satisfaction (not pooled due to heterogeneity). For quality of life, except for one trial at the short term follow-up, the included trials found no between group differences at all time points. Conflicting results were found for treatment satisfaction (supplemental file 8).

### How effective are physiotherapy interventions in treating people with sciatica? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113EPKBn]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review, including 18 studies and 2699 participants with a clinical diagnosis of sciatica suggests that physiotherapy interventions are only better than minimal interventions in reducing pain at long-term time points. Physiotherapy interventions are less effective than substantial interventions (e.g. surgery) in reducing pain at medium term and disability at short- and medium-term time points. However, heterogeneity was considerable in most meta-analyses, and confidence intervals were large, indicating substantial uncertainly surrounding the precision of these estimates. The favourable results for substantial intervention for pain in medium term and disability in short term did not persist following sensitivity analyses removing studies with high risk of bias. The currently available literature therefore provides insufficient evidence to support strong recommendations for physiotherapy interventions in the treatment of people with sciatica.

This systematic review reflects a wider collective inability to show significant benefit of non-surgical treatments for people with sciatica. Pharmacological options fail to demonstrate effects beyond placebo, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, anti-convulsants, anti-depressants or opioids. Epidural cortisone injections have small effect sizes and short-term benefits. These findings are disappointing given the clear need for effective conservative interventions voiced by patients.

### Surgery versus prolonged conservative treatment for sciatica [^114fxZpX]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2007). Excellent credibility.

Background

Lumbar-disk surgery often is performed in patients who have sciatica that does not resolve within 6 weeks, but the optimal timing of surgery is not known.

Methods

We randomly assigned 283 patients who had had severe sciatica for 6 to 12 weeks to early surgery or to prolonged conservative treatment with surgery if needed. The primary outcomes were the score on the Roland Disability Questionnaire, the score on the visual-analogue scale for leg pain, and the patient's report of perceived recovery during the first year after randomization. Repeated-measures analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle was used to estimate the outcome curves for both groups.

Results

Of 141 patients assigned to undergo early surgery, 125 (89%) underwent microdiskectomy after a mean of 2.2 weeks. Of 142 patients designated for conservative treatment, 55 (39%) were treated surgically after a mean of 18.7 weeks. There was no significant overall difference in disability scores during the first year (P = 0.13). Relief of leg pain was faster for patients assigned to early surgery (P < 0.001). Patients assigned to early surgery also reported a faster rate of perceived recovery (hazard ratio, 1.97; 95% confidence interval, 1.72 to 2.22; P < 0.001). In both groups, however, the probability of perceived recovery after 1 year of follow-up was 95%.

Conclusions

The 1-year outcomes were similar for patients assigned to early surgery and those assigned to conservative treatment with eventual surgery if needed, but the rates of pain relief and of perceived recovery were faster for those assigned to early surgery.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Two trained independent raters assessed the quality of the trials' methods using the PEDro scale. Disagreements were resolved by a third rater. Methodological quality was not an inclusion criterion.

Two independent reviewers extracted means (final scores or change score), standard deviations, and sample sizes from studies using a standardised data extraction form. When there was insufficient information in trial reports, we contacted authors or estimated data using methods recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Briefly, when the mean was not reported we used the median; when standard deviations could not be estimated, we adopted the standard deviation from the most similar study.

To evaluate the overall quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendation, we used the GRADE approach. We used an adapted version of the criteria advocated by the Cochrane Back Review Group. The quality of the evidence was downgraded by one level for each of four factors we encountered: limitations in the design (for instance, > 25% of participants from studies with low quality methods — PEDro score < 7 points); inconsistency of results (for instance, ≤ 75% of the participants report findings in the same direction); and imprecision (for instance, total number of participants < 300 for each outcome). We did not assess publication bias with funnel plots as too few studies were included in the meta-analysis. We also did not assess indirectness as this review encompasses a specific population. Two reviewers judged whether these factors were present for each outcome. Single randomised studies (with under 300 participants) were considered inconsistent and imprecise (that is, sparse data) and provided "low quality evidence". This could be further downgraded to "very low quality evidence" if there were also limitations in design. We applied the following definitions of quality of the evidence:

High quality — further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. There are no known or suspected reporting biases; all domains fulfilled
Moderate quality — further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and might change the estimate; one of the domains was not fulfilled
Low quality — further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate; two of the domains were not fulfilled
Very low quality — we are uncertain about the estimate; three of the domains were not fulfilled.

A GRADE profile was completed for each pooled estimate and for single trials comparing drugs versus placebo.

### Stratified care versus usual care for management of patients presenting with sciatica in primary care (SCOPiC): a randomised controlled trial [^115dZYyK]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The term sciatica describes symptoms of pain radiating from the low back to the legs, and it can be associated with sensory and motor deficits. Occasionally, patients only have leg pain with no associated back pain. A prolapsed disc causing compression of lumbar spinal nerve roots is the most common cause of sciatica. Sciatica has a substantial impact on patients and constitutes a considerable health-care, social, and economic burden.

As in many countries, most patients with sciatica in the UK are managed in primary care. For most patients, especially those with a short symptom duration, usual care comprises mostly a stepped-care approach, starting with conservative interventions such as advice, medications, and physiotherapy, with those patients who show no improvement eventually being offered imaging, specialist assessment, and consideration of suitability for invasive treatments (eg, injections or surgery). A longer symptom duration of sciatica is related to worse outcomes following both conservative and surgical treatment. In the absence of a systematic way to identify patients who might need more support in their care, including a referral to specialists for consideration of more invasive treatments, there is considerable variation in practice. The current, mainly stepped care, approach means that most patients have to show no improvement with previous interventions before being considered for further treatments, resulting in delays in referral to spinal specialists.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched PubMed up to Dec 31, 2013, with the search terms "stratified care", "sciatica", and "radiculopathy". The search was restricted to English language publications. We found no previous trials of stratified care for patients with sciatica before undertaking our study. Therefore, no systematic review was possible. The evidence considered came from previous research on prognostic stratified care for patients with non-specific lower back pain (STarT Back and IMPaCT Back studies) and a cohort of patients with sciatica (ATLAS study) in the primary care setting, from which we examined the factors predicting referral of patients to specialist spinal services. These previous studies shaped the development of the stratification algorithm (previously published) that was tested in this trial.

### Surgical microdiscectomy versus transforaminal epidural steroid injection in patients with sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc (NERVES): a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation [^113yXFzx]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Herniated lumbar disc resulting in back and leg pain travelling below the knee, sciatica, or radiculopathy is a worldwide burden to society. The condition affects an estimated 11% of patients presenting to their primary-care provider worldwide, with an annual prevalence estimated to be 2·2%. Generally, outcomes are favourable and 80% of patients improve with conservative care within 12–24 months. However, given that patients affected by this condition are typically aged 40–45 years, there is a risk of loss of livelihood if it is not managed promptly.

Treatment options have been considered by various expert-led guidelines, but no consensus exists for transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI) due to a scarcity of class I evidence. Generally, once analgesia and lifestyle-modifying treatments have failed, steroid nerve root injections and surgical microdiscectomy are recommended for severe persistent cases. Stepwise care approaches based on treatment with non-opioids have been identified as likely to represent a more cost-effective approach than strategies involving direct referral for disc surgery; however, evidence for a stepwise treatment progression involving TFESI is scarce. Following various randomised trials comparing surgical treatments with non-surgical therapy, surgery is often deemed the most successful treatment option, leading to more than 10 000 discectomy procedures per year in the UK and 190 000 such procedures in the USA. The costs to the UK's National Health Service (NHS) for microdiscectomy (requiring patients to be hospitalised for 2 nights, on average) are approximately £4500 compared with £700 for TFESI.

### How effective are physiotherapy interventions in treating people with sciatica? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111jg71Q]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

'Sciatica' is a broad term describing spinally referred pain of neural origin that radiates into the leg. The reported prevalence of sciatica varies widely (1.2–43%), probably due to different diagnostic criteria, reflecting a heterogeneous patient population. Sciatica is a significant burden to healthcare and the economy, as a neuropathic component in low back pain it is not only linked to poorer quality of life, but also increases the already high costs of back pain by a further 67%. Although prognosis is good for most patients, up to 45% continue to have symptoms for 12 months or longer.

Physiotherapy interventions such as exercise, manual therapy and psychological therapy are recommended in clinical guidelines for people with sciatica. However, the available systematic reviews examining the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions are at least ten years old. For example, study selection in the most recent systematic review comparing surgery versus conservative care ended in 2009. Their results could not be meta-analysed due to poor reporting and clinical heterogeneity. Similarly, a network-meta-analysis concluded its search in 2009, finding no support for the effectiveness of exercise or traction while manipulation may be beneficial. However, the latter was based on a single study only. Prior to this, reviews specifically focusing on conservative management of sciatica were published in 2010 and 2007 and were unable to make strong conclusions on the superiority of any treatment. More recent reviews published in 2015 and 2016 were limited to a subset of physiotherapy interventions (e.g. physical activity versus surgery and exercise versus advice to stay active). A recent review looked at a range of physiotherapy interventions, however the review did not include a meta-analysis.

Of note, sciatica is a heterogeneous condition with no agreed diagnostic criteria. Most reviews to date make no reference to the clinical diagnosis of included study participants rendering it unclear whether patients had confirmed nerve involvement. The objective of this systematic review was therefore to assess the up-to-date evidence on the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions compared with control interventions in people with clinically diagnosed sciatica.

### Acute lumbar disk pain: navigating evaluation and treatment choices [^114L4it6]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Acute lumbar disk herniations are the most common cause of sciatica. After excluding emergent causes, such as cauda equina syndrome, epidural abscess, fracture, or malignancy, a six-week trial of conservative management is indicated. Patients should be advised to stay active. If symptoms persist after six weeks, or if there is worsening neurologic function, imaging and invasive procedures may be considered. Most patients with lumbar disk herniations improve over six weeks. Because there is no difference in outcomes between surgical and conservative treatment after two years, patient preference and the severity of the disability from the pain should be considered when choosing treatment modalities. If a disk herniation is identified that correlates with physical findings, surgical diskectomy may improve symptoms more quickly than continued conservative management. Epidural steroid injections can also provide short-term relief.

### Bed rest for acute low-back pain and sciatica [^116CJmkP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Low-back pain (LBP) is a common reason for consulting a general practitioner, and advice on daily activities is an important part of the primary care management of low-back pain.

Objectives

To assess the effects of advice to rest in bed for patients with acute LBP or sciatica.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Back Group Specialized Registry, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Sport, and SCISEARCH to March 2003, reference lists of relevant articles, and contacted authors of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or controlled clinical trials with quasi-randomisation (alternate allocation, case record numbers, dates of birth, etc.), in any language, where the effectiveness of advice to rest in bed was evaluated. The main outcomes of interest were pain, functional status, recovery and return to work.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the internal validity of included trials and extracted data. Investigators were contacted to obtain missing information.

Main Results

Eleven trials (1963 patients) were included in this updated version. There is high quality evidence that people with acute LBP who are advised to rest in bed have a little more pain [Standardised Mean Difference (SMD) 0.22 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.02, 0.41)] and a little less functional recovery [SMD 0.29 (95% CI: 0.05, 0.45)] than those advised to stay active. For patients with sciatica, there is moderate quality evidence of little or no difference in pain [SMD -0.03 (95% CI: -0.24, 0.18)] or functional status [SMD 0.19 (95% CI: -0.02, 0.41)] between bed rest and staying active. For patients with acute LBP, there is moderate quality evidence of little or no difference in pain intensity or functional status between bed rest and exercises. For patients with sciatica, there is moderate quality evidence of little or no difference in pain intensity between bed rest and physiotherapy, but small improvements in functional status [Weighted Mean Difference 6.9 (on a 0–100 scale) (95% CI: 1.09, 12.74)] with physiotherapy. There is moderate quality evidence of little or no difference in pain intensity or functional status between two to three days and seven days of bed rest.

Reviewers' Conclusions

For people with acute LBP, advice to rest in bed is less effective than advice to stay active. For patients with sciatica, there is little or no difference between advice to rest in bed and advice to stay active. There is little or no difference in the effect of bed rest compared to exercises or physiotherapy, or seven days of bed rest compared with two to three.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1121zk4g]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effectiveness and safety of surgery compared with non-surgical treatment for sciatica.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from database inception to June 2022.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Randomised controlled trials comparing any surgical treatment with non-surgical treatment, epidural steroid injections, or placebo or sham surgery, in people with sciatica of any duration due to lumbar disc herniation (diagnosed by radiological imaging).

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two independent reviewers extracted data. Leg pain and disability were the primary outcomes. Adverse events, back pain, quality of life, and satisfaction with treatment were the secondary outcomes. Pain and disability scores were converted to a scale of 0 (no pain or disability) to 100 (worst pain or disability). Data were pooled using a random effects model. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool and certainty of evidence with the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) framework. Follow-up times were into immediate term (≤ six weeks), short term (> six weeks and ≤ three months), medium term (> three and < 12 months), and long term (at 12 months).

Results

24 trials were included, half of these investigated the effectiveness of discectomy compared with non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections (1711 participants). Very low to low certainty evidence showed that discectomy, compared with non-surgical treatment, reduced leg pain: the effect size was moderate at immediate term (mean difference -12.1 (95% confidence interval -23.6 to -0.5)) and short term (-11.7 (-18.6 to -4.7)), and small at medium term (-6.5 (-11.0 to -2.1)). Negligible effects were noted at long term (-2.3 (-4.5 to -0.2)). For disability, small, negligible, or no effects were found. A similar effect on leg pain was found when comparing discectomy with epidural steroid injections. For disability, a moderate effect was found at short term, but no effect was observed at medium and long term. The risk of any adverse events was similar between discectomy and non-surgical treatment (risk ratio 1.34 (95% confidence interval 0.91 to 1.98)).

Conclusion

Very low to low certainty evidence suggests that discectomy was superior to non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections in reducing leg pain and disability in people with sciatica with a surgical indication, but the benefits declined over time. Discectomy might be an option for people with sciatica who feel that the rapid relief offered by discectomy outweighs the risks and costs associated with surgery.

### Sciatica: what the rheumatologist needs to know [^113KCa4R]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Sciatica is a set of symptoms rather than a specific diagnosis, and is caused by a herniated lumbar disc in the vast majority of cases. The most important symptom is lower limb pain radiating below the knee and into the foot and toes. The clinical course of acute sciatica is generally favorable, with most pain and related disability improving within 2–4 weeks with or without treatment. Diagnosis mainly involves history taking and physical examination. Imaging is warranted if there is evidence of an underlying pathology other than disc herniation, such as infection or malignancy, and in patients with severe symptoms that do not improve after 6–8 weeks of conservative treatment. MRI is the preferred imaging modality, as it can visualize soft tissues better than CT and does not expose the patient to ionizing radiation. Conservative treatment is generally the first-line option in patients with sciatica; however, the currently available evidence does not show any intervention — including a broad range of conservative and surgical approaches — to have clearly superior outcomes. Thus, patient preference seems to be an important factor in the clinical management of sciatica.

### Efficacy of electroacupuncture combined with Chinese herbal medicine on pain intensity for chronic sciatica secondary to lumbar disc herniation: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^113EvXP4]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods/Design

Study Aims

This study is a single-center RCT study aimed at investigating the efficacy and safety of the combination of Shenxie Zhitong capsule and EA treatment for discogenic sciatica. In terms of effectiveness, we will mainly focus on the advantages of Shenxie Zhitong capsule combined with EA treatment, compared with Celecoxib, in pain reduction. Besides, we will also evaluate the effectiveness of Shenxie Zhitong capsule combined with EA treatment in improving lumbar dysfunction and daily living ability.

Study Design

The detailed study process is illustrated in Figure 1. We design this single-center, parallel-group, patient-unblinded RCT with blinded outcome assessment and statistician following the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) and the Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) guidelines. The recruiting time is from 2023–05–01 to 2023–12–31 and the study execute time is from 2023–05–01 to 2024–04–01. The trial will be conducted in outpatient departments of Shuguang Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine in China. IRB of Shuguang Hospital affiliated with Shanghai University of TCM has approved the study protocol (version 2.0, 6 April 2023) with an approval number of 2023–1305–72–01. It was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry on 25th April 2023 with the registration number of ChiCTR2300070884. The protocol is reported in accordance with the Standard Protocol Items (SPIRIT). For details, please see.

### Timing of surgery for sciatica: subgroup analysis alongside a randomized trial [^115mhNnw]. European Spine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

This randomized trial unequivocally showed that early surgery led to significantly faster recovery compared to prolonged conservative care but failed to present any interaction with (effect modification by) classical neurological signs and MRI findings. Remarkably only the anamnestic finding "sciatica provoked by sitting" showed interaction with timing of surgery, and thus influenced rate of recovery. These results were markedly consistent in stratified analyses of all primary outcomes over the first year and presented a larger effect size in favour of early surgery in those patients who were unable to sit as a result of sciatic neuralgia.

The finding that classic physical signs and high preference of the patient for surgery did not affect the results of treatment strategies was surprising and not expected. Currently most physicians and physiotherapists refer patients for surgery under the near mandatory condition that the straight leg raise test provokes sciatica. The design of this trial made it possible to include enough patients with a negative straight leg raising test. These, however, form a minority which may be due to selection bias. Therefore these results must have to be interpreted very carefully, which also holds true for the findings regarding patient preferences. Earlier prognostic studies suggested a realistic relationship between patient's and doctor's preferences and expectations on the one hand and outcome on the other. These expectations are still likely to play a major role since the patients in this randomized trial were all eager to undergo surgery; in fact this was their main motive to visit the outpatient clinic of the participating hospitals. Only a minority of patients did not have a clear preference for surgery and no patient had a preference for the conservative treatment strategy. Therefore the lack of influence of patient preferences on treatment strategies is not directly applicable to general practice.

### WITHDRAWN: advice to stay active as a single treatment for low-back pain and sciatica [^117PH3nB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Low back pain is one of the most common conditions managed in primary care. Restricted activity, rest, and symptomatic analgesics are the most commonly prescribed treatment for low back pain and sciatica.

Objectives

To assess the effects of advice to stay active as single treatment for patients with low back pain.

Search Strategy

Computerised searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Sport, The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Musculoskeletal Group's Trials Register and Scisearch, and scanning of reference lists from relevant articles were undertaken. Relevant studies were also traced by contacting authors. Date of the most recent searches: December 1998.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised trials or quasi-randomised trials where the study population consisted of adult patients with low back pain or sciatica, in which one comparison group was advised to stay active. The main outcomes of interest were pain, functional status, recovery and return to work.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the validity of included trials and extracted data. Investigators were contacted to collect missing data or for clarification when needed.

Main Results

Four trials, with a total of 491 patients, were included. Advice to stay active was compared to advice to rest in bed in all trials. Two trials were assessed to have low risk of bias and two to have moderate to high risk of bias. The results were heterogeneous. Results from one high quality trial of patients with acute simple LBP found small differences in functional status [Weighted Mean Difference (on a 0–100 scale) 6.0 (95% CI: 1.5, 10.5)] and length of sick leave [WMD 3.4 days (95% CI: 1.6, 5.2)] in favour of staying active compared to advice to stay in bed for two days. The other high quality trial compared advice to stay active with advice to rest in bed for 14 days for patients with sciatic syndrome, and found no differences between the groups. One of the high quality trials also compared advice to stay active with exercises for patients with acute simple LBP, and found improvement in functional status and reduction in sick leave in favour of advice to stay active.

Authors' Conclusions

The best available evidence suggests that advice to stay active alone has small beneficial effects for patients with acute simple low back pain, and little or no effect for patients with sciatica. There is no evidence that advice to stay active is harmful for either acute low back pain or sciatica. If there is no major difference between advice to stay active and advice to rest in bed, and there is potential harmful effects of prolonged bed rest, then it is reasonable to advise people with acute low back pain and sciatica to stay active. These conclusions are based on single trials.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^111ALGid]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this review we identified five studies comparing surgery with conservative care. Only one low-risk-of-bias study compared early surgery to prolonged conservative care and demonstrated more relief of leg pain up to 3 months for early surgery, but at 1 year the differences disappeared. The trials of surgery versus usual conservative treatment showed inconsistent findings. One low-risk-of-bias study compared surgery versus conservative treatment and found no differences between the two treatments. We were unable to perform a meta-analysis of these three studies because of the poor data presented in two of the studies. An observational cohort study conducted alongside one trial included 743 patients that received their preferred treatment. Both groups improved substantially over time, but surgery showed significantly better results for pain and function as compared with conservative treatment.

Three of the five studies found an effect in the early postoperative period, which diminished during further follow-up. This is relevant because a faster recovery rate could, besides the clinical benefit, have an economic advantage in a relatively young patient population. A cost-effectiveness study performed alongside the trial of Peul et al. showed that surgery is cost-effective with a willingness to pay 40,000 € as per quality-adjusted life years (QALY). In relation to this, timing of treatment is under debate, but for a reliable analysis of the effect of different timing, information about duration of symptoms is needed. The duration between onset of symptoms and actual treatment is described in four of the five trials. Equally important is the timing of the treatment after diagnosis by protocol or waiting list. This is only reported in two of the trials being 2 weeks. Heterogeneity in the duration of the symptoms or in the timing of treatments introduces a difference in timing of treatment since the onset of complaints and thus bias in the analysis of recovery rate.

### Novel approach to characterising individuals with low back-related leg pain: cluster identification with latent class analysis and 12-month follow-up [^1138GCVm]. Pain (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Trials evaluating treatments for low back pain (LBP), show at best moderate effect sizes. The heterogeneity of LBP patients within studies is one explanation for these results. This has stimulated research aiming to identify more homogeneous, clinically relevant subgroups of LBP patients, with the hope that these subgroups might respond more favourably to interventions or management approaches matched to the subgroup's characteristics or presenting symptoms.

One of the most common subgroup of LBP is back pain radiating to the leg, which represents about two thirds of back pain patients, in both primary and secondary care settings. Patients with low back-related leg pain (LBLP) suffer more severe pain and disability, take longer to recover and lose more time from work, compared to those with pain in the lower back alone.

When patients present with LBLP, once serious pathology (such as tumours, cauda equina compression, fracture, inflammatory causes) is ruled out, the differential diagnosis is between leg pain that is due to spinal nerve root involvement (commonly called sciatica) or to non-specific pain in the leg thought to be referred from structures in the back (e.g. disc/muscle/joint) but not involving the nerve root.

This is a rather broad brush categorisation however and currently there is a gap in the evidence regarding whether individual items from the clinical assessment, can be used to identify hitherto unrecognised subgroups of patients with LBLP who have distinct presentations of symptoms and characteristics. Early identification and differentiation of subgroups of LBLP may provide more help when informing patients about prognosis, tailoring treatment plans to match profiles and guiding the need for referrals to specialist services in a timely fashion.

The objective of this study was to use items from clinical assessment to identify new subgroups in an unselected primary care population consulting with LBLP. Statistical modelling, such as latent class analysis provides a method of classifying patients and may lead to the identification of clusters of patients with similar characteristics, over and above the binary diagnostic categories of sciatica or referred leg pain. Clusters identified in this way were compared for baseline demographic, pain, physical function, psychosocial and work features, risk of persistent disability and findings from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine. Key characteristics reflecting pain, disability, psychological status and perceived recovery were compared at 4 and 12 months and the clinical course, in terms of monthly pain and disability scores over 12 months for the individual clusters, was described and compared to that of the clinically defined groups of LBLP patients with and without a diagnosis of sciatica.

### Intensive interdisciplinary outpatient pain management program for chronic back pain: a pilot study [^113THNM4]. Journal of Pain Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic back pain is relatively resistant to unimodal therapy regimes. The aim of this study was to introduce and evaluate the short-term outcome of a three-week intensive multidisciplinary outpatient program for patients with back pain and sciatica, measured according to decrease of functional impairment and pain.

Methods

The program was designed for patients suffering from chronic back pain to provide intensive interdisciplinary therapy in an outpatient setting, consisting of interventional injection techniques, medication, exercise therapy, back education, ergotherapy, traction, massage therapy, medical training, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, aquatraining, and relaxation.

Results

Based on Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) scores, a significant improvement in pain intensity and functionality of 66.83% NRS and an ODI of 33.33% were achieved by our pain program within 3 weeks.

Conclusion

This paper describes the organization and short-term outcome of an intensive multidisciplinary program for chronic back pain on an outpatient basis provided by our orthopedic department, with clinically significant results.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111TFJhh]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The clinical syndrome of sciatica has been recognised since ancient times. Currently believed to arise from a disorder of the nerve root, the syndrome is known by a range of synonyms such as lumbosacral radicular syndrome, nerve root compromise, nerve root pain, and nerve root entrapment or irritation. Sciatica is considered to be a prognostic indicator of poor outcome among patients with low back painwith a substantial proportion continuing to have persistent pain for two years or longer. The annual prevalence of sciatica is estimated to be between 14%and 2%. While there are a range of definitions of sciatica, the key clinical features that can help clinicians to distinguish it from non-specific low back pain include unilateral leg pain that is worse than the low back pain, pain radiating below the knee, presence of numbness or pins and needles in a dermatomal distribution, positive results on a straight leg raise test, and weakness or reflex changes, or both, in a myotomal distribution.

Analgesic and adjuvant pain drugs are often prescribed for patients with sciatica. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of sciatica are about five times more likely to take drugs than those with low back pain only. Drugs commonly prescribed for the management of sciatica include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), skeletal muscle relaxants, opioid analgesics, benzodiazepines, systemic corticosteroids, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants. While guidelines provide clear and generally consistent recommendations for the prescription of drugs for non-specific low back pain, this is not the case for sciatica.

At present the efficacy and tolerability of commonly prescribed analgesic and adjuvant drugs for the management of patients with sciatica has not been established. The problem is that there are no reviews that specifically focus on these drugs that are used in primary care to manage sciatica. Because most guidelines recommend a course of conservative care before surgery is considered, it is imperative to understand what best practice conservative care should entail. In this systematic review we determined the efficacy and tolerability of analgesic and adjuvant pain drugs typically administered in primary care (orally, topically, or parentally) in the management of patients with sciatica when compared with other treatment options or no treatment.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114CQYTp]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations of review

The strengths of this systematic review include the use of a prespecified protocol, inclusion of trials published in languages other than English, and the use of a highly sensitive search strategy to identify trials for sciatica coupled with search terms related to the nine classes of drugs of interest. We assessed methodological quality with the PEDro scale rather than the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool because the PEDro scale has been shown to have acceptable reliabilityand validity, whereas two studies have reported reliability limitations with the Cochrane tool. One limitation of our study is the possibility of publication bias as we did not attempt to identify unpublished trials that could be found in clinical trials registries and conference proceedings. Another limitation is that we could accommodate trials in only four languages other than English.

A strength of our review over past reviews is that we located 24 randomised clinical trials relevant to our question compared with six, three, and twotrials included in the four previous reviews. Accordingly we provide more precise estimates of treatment effects, specifically for NSAIDs and corticosteroids, and a better description about tolerability of all classes of drug. Including more trials has allowed us to provide a more in-depth evaluation of the pharmacological treatments that have been tested for sciatica in primary care. For example, we have provided information on the efficacy of antidepressants and opioid analgesics whereas previous reviews did not cover these classes of drugs. Another strength of this review is that we quantitatively pooled trials where possible. This allowed us to explore the size of the treatment effect, which is not possible in a qualitative summary. In addition, we were able to assess the overall quality of the evidence with the GRADE approach. Although conclusions of previous reviews were based on a surprising paucity of evidence, our findings are likely to inform the direction of future research in this topic. In pharmacological trials for sciatica, we consider the priorities to include consideration of duration of symptoms, recruitment of large samples, and collection of outcomes relevant to patients. For instance, regarding duration of symptoms it would be reasonable to test corticosteroids and NSAIDs in trials in patients with acute sciatica, whereas given that chronic sciatica includes a neuropathic pain component, anticonvulsant and antidepressants might need to be tested in patients with a chronic condition.

### Cost effectiveness of epidural steroid injections to manage chronic lower back pain [^113piCiB]. BMC Anesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

An English trial of multiple ESIs for sciatica included around 230 patients. As with the PINE study, these were assessed twice only in the short term, at 3 and at 6 weeks. Against a placebo saline injection, the estimated health gain was even smaller, at 0.006 QALYs per patient, and almost all this accrued at 3 weeks. Again by way of explanation, quality of life outcomes for the sciatica trial were measured using the SF36 instrument, translated to the SF-6D and its associated utilities. There is robust evidence from parallel instrumentation studies that, for a given health improvement, the utility gain when measured using the SF-6D is significantly smaller than when measured by the EQ-5D. Also, and unlike our patients, the sciatica patients were a mixture of chronic and acute, and the health gain amongst the acute patients was smaller. Finally, the sciatica trial was not so much a trial of the procedure as of the active ingredient, because all subjects received an injection.

A common feature of both of these previous trials was that the subjects had no record of successful treatment by ESI. Indeed, previous receipt of an ESI for pain was an explicit exclusion criterion for the sciatica trial. In contrast, all our patients had received ESIs at the Pain Clinic on previous occasions. One of the few areas of agreement in the debate over the efficacy of ESIs is that not all people experiencing chronic back pain respond to treatment. It therefore follows that differential bias in recruitment must also contribute to explaining the differences in findings. Trials requiring subjects to have no experience of ESI in pain relief are more likely to recruit people for whom the technique will prove ineffectual, thereby lowering the average health gain recorded. In contrast, the clientele of any clinic offering routine care will be dominated by patients for whom the treatment is efficacious. Many of the patients unresponsive to ESI, therefore, would have discontinued treatment prior to being recruited into our study.

### The cochrane review of advice to stay active as a single treatment for low back pain and sciatica [^111G3YM5]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

Study Design

A systematic review was conducted within the Cochrane Collaboration Back Review Group.

Objectives

To assess the effects of advice to stay active as a single treatment for patients with acute low back pain or sciatica.

Summary Of Background Data

Low back pain is a common reason for consulting a health care provider, and advice on daily activities constitutes an important part in the primary care management of low back pain.

Methods

All randomized studies available in systematic searches (electronic databases, contact with authors, reference lists) were included. Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the validity of the included trials, and extracted data. Investigators were contacted to obtain missing information.

Results

Four trials, with a total of 491 patients, were included. In all the trials, advice to stay active was compared with advice for bed rest. Two trials were assessed as having a low risk of bias, and two as having a moderate to high risk of bias. The results were heterogeneous. The results from one high-quality trial of patients with acute, simple low back pain found small differences in functional status (weighted mean difference on a 0 to 100 scale, 6.0; 95% CI, 1.5–10.5) and length of sick leave (weighted mean difference, 3.4 days; 95% CI, 1.6–5.2) in favor of staying active, as compared with advice to stay in bed 2 days. The other high-quality trial compared advice to stay active with advice to rest in bed 14 days for patients with sciatic syndrome, and found no differences between the groups. One of the high-quality trials also compared advice to stay active with advice to engage in exercises for patients with acute, simple low back pain, and found improvement in functional status and reduced sick leave in favor of advice to stay active.

Conclusion

The best available evidence suggests that advice to stay active alone has little beneficial effect for patients with acute, simple low back pain, and little or no effect for patients with sciatica. There is no evidence that advice to stay active is harmful for either acute low back pain or sciatica. Because there is no considerable difference between advice to stay active and advice for bed rest, and there are potential harmful effects of prolonged bed rest, it is reasonable to advise people with acute low back pain and sciatica to stay active. These conclusions are based on single trials.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^113uwKUW]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Early surgery versus prolonged conservative care

One large randomised trial (n = 283) with a low risk of bias compared early surgery to prolonged conservative treatment followed by surgery if needed in patients with severe sciatica for 6–12 weeks. Of the patients, 89% randomised to early surgery underwent microdiscectomy after a mean of 2 weeks, while 39% of patients randomised to conservative treatment underwent surgery after a mean of 19 weeks. Relief of leg pain was faster for patients assigned to early surgery. Intention-to-treat analysis showed statistically significant more leg pain relief in favour of early surgery as compared with prolonged conservative care at 3 months (MD −17.70, 95% CI −23.1 to −12.3). There was no significant overall difference between the two groups in disability scores during the first year. The median time to recovery was 4.0 weeks [95% confidence interval (CI), 3.7–4.4] for early surgery and 12.1 weeks (95% CI, 9.5–14.9) for prolonged conservative treatment. During the first year, early surgery achieved a faster rate of perceived recovery with a hazard ratio of 1.97 (95% CI 1.72–2.22, P < 0.001). At 1 year of follow-up, however, 95% of patients in both treatment groups had experienced satisfactory recovery, and no subsequent differences were found. This lack of a difference between groups was maintained for the following year. In conclusion, one low-risk-of-bias study yielded a low level of evidence (GRADE) to the effect that early surgery was beneficial for pain relief as compared to prolonged conservative care in the short term, but not in the longer term with a faster recovery rate for early surgery.

### Physical therapy plus general practitioners' care versus general practitioners' care alone for sciatica: a randomised clinical trial with a 12-month follow-up [^112imvE9]. European Spine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

The lumbosacral radicular syndrome (LRS), also called sciatica, is a disorder with radiating pain in the leg below the knee in one or more lumbar or sacral dermatomes, and can be accompanied by phenomena associated with nerve root tension or neurological deficits. A prolapsed disc is a frequent cause of LRS, but other causes include spinal or lateral recess stenosis, tumours and radiculitis. The incidence of LRS in the Netherlands is estimated at 5 per 1,000 persons a year.

There is consensus that treatment of LRS in the first 6–8 weeks should be conservative. The exact content of the conservative treatment is, however not yet clear. After the study of Vroomen et al. bed rest is no longer regarded as a treatment option for LRS. Assessed in a recent systematic review was the effectiveness of conservative treatments of LRS. Thirty trials were included that evaluated injections (n = 14), traction (n = 9), physical therapy (PT) (n = 4), bed rest (n = 2), manipulation (n = 2), medication (n = 2) and acupuncture (n = 1) as a treatment for LRS. Because several trials indicated no evidence of an effect it is not recommended to use corticosteroid injections and traction as treatment option. Whether clinicians should prescribe PT, bed rest, manipulation or medication could not be concluded from this review. Therefore, there is no evidence that one type of conservative treatment is clearly superior to others for patients with LRS.

In an previous observational study it was shown that GPs did not adhere to the guideline regarding the referral to PT; almost half of patients with LRS were referred for PT, although this was not recommended in the guideline. No specific characteristic could be identified to explain this referral to PT. Moreover, there is a lack of knowledge concerning the effectiveness of PT in LRS. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effectiveness of PT management additional to GP management compared to GP management alone, in patients with acute LRS.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115VyQ8n]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Although the knowledge of evidence about surgery has changed in the past decade, we still do not know much about a simpler conservative treatment such as pharmacological interventions for sciatica. A recent clinical practice guideline from the American Pain Societyrecommends that surgery should be considered as a treatment option for persistent and disabling radicular pain caused by a herniated lumbar disc. This recommendation relies on moderate short term benefits from large randomised clinical trials such as those by Peul et aland Weinstein et al, with 283 and 501 patients randomised, respectively. At present, there is a limited number of mainly small trials of pharmacological interventions with typically short term follow-up. For example, the evidence to support the use of anticonvulsants in chronic sciatica arises from a single trial with only 50 participants.

Our principal finding is that there is insufficient evidence to confidently guide the use of any analgesic or adjuvant pain medicine for the effective management of pain and disability in patients with sciatica. Until this changes, we would advise clinicians treating such patients who exhibit clinical features of neuropathic pain to consider evidence based guidelines for neuropathic painand for other patients with sciatica to consider therapeutic recommendations from current guidelines for the management of non-specific low back pain.

### Surgery or physical activity in the management of sciatica: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115bRoxp]. European Spine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Previous reviews have compared surgical to non-surgical management of sciatica, but have overlooked the specific comparison between surgery and physical activity-based interventions.

Methods

Systematic review using MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase and PEDro databases was conducted. Randomised controlled trials comparing surgery to physical activity, where patients were experiencing the three most common causes of sciatica-disc herniation, spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis. Two independent reviewers extracted pain and disability data (converted to a common 0–100 scale) and assessed methodological quality using the PEDro scale. The size of the effects was estimated for each outcome at three different time points, with a random effects model adopted and the GRADE approach used in summary conclusions.

Results

Twelve trials were included. In the short term, surgery provided better outcomes than physical activity for disc herniation: disability [WMD -9.00 (95% CI -13.73, -4.27)], leg pain [WMD -16.01 (95% CI -23.00, -9.02)] and back pain [WMD -12.44 (95% CI -17.76, -7.09)]; for spondylolisthesis: disability [WMD -14.60 (95% CI -17.12, -12.08)], leg pain [WMD -35.00 (95% CI -39.66, -30.34)] and back pain [WMD -20.00 (95% CI -24.66, -15.34)] and spinal stenosis: disability [WMD -11.39 (95% CI -17.31, -5.46)], leg pain [WMD, -27.17 (95% CI -35.87, -18.46)] and back pain [WMD -20.80 (95% CI -25.15, -16.44)]. Long-term and greater than 2-year post-randomisation results favoured surgery for spondylolisthesis and stenosis, although the size of the effects reduced with time. For disc herniation, no significant effect was shown for leg and back pain comparing surgery to physical activity.

Conclusion

There are indications that surgery is superior to physical activity-based interventions in reducing pain and disability for disc herniation at short-term follow-up only; but high-quality evidence in this field is lacking (GRADE). For spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis, surgery is superior to physical activity up to greater than 2 years follow-up. Results should guide clinicians and patients when facing the difficult decision of having surgery or engaging in active care interventions. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42013005746.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^116ayzsD]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of sciatic symptoms reported in the literature varies considerably ranging from 1.6% in the general population to 43% in a selected working population. Although the prognosis is good in most patients, a substantial proportion (up to 30%) continues to have pain for 1 year or longer. In approximately 90% of the cases, sciatica is caused by a herniated disc involving nerve root compression. However, lumbar canal stenosis or foraminal stenosis and (less often) tumours or cysts are other possible causes.

The most important symptom of sciatica is lumbosacral radicular leg pain that follows a dermatomal pattern radiating below the knee and into the foot and toes. The pain worsens with coughing; patients may report sensory symptoms, limited forward flexion of the lumbar spine, gait deformity and unilateral spasm of the paraspinal muscles. However, most patients present with a less clear clinical picture. In acute sciatica, diagnostic imaging may only be indicated if there are indications of underlying pathology (e.g. infections, malignancies) other than disc herniation. In patients with persistent and severe symptoms who fail to improve following 6–8 weeks of non-surgical treatment, imaging might be useful to identify the presence or absence of a herniated disc with nerve root compression.

### Stratified care versus usual care for management of patients presenting with sciatica in primary care (SCOPiC): a randomised controlled trial [^112jK66q]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Outcomes

Informed by the involvement of patients before the trial, the primary outcome was time to first resolution of sciatica symptoms, defined as "completely recovered" or "much better", measured on a 6-point ordinal scale and collected via text messages (or brief telephone calls). The scale's anchor was patients' baseline symptoms when they attended the SCOPiC research clinic. The text message read: "Compared to how you were at the SCOPiC clinic X weeks/months ago, how are your back and leg symptoms today?" Primary outcome data collection occurred weekly for the first 4 months for all participants, and then every 4 weeks between 4 and 12 months' follow-up, or until "stable resolution" of symptoms (defined as 2 consecutive months' responses of "completely recovered" or "much better").

Secondary clinical outcomes were collected at 4 and 12 months by use of self-completed postal questionnaires. These included: global perceived change (GPC; 6-point ordinal scale as per primary outcome data collection), physical function, overall impact of sciatica symptoms, back and leg pain intensity, sleep disturbance, fear of movement, anxiety and depression, risk of persistent back-pain related disability, health-related quality of life (EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L), general health, neuropathic pain symptoms, days lost from work and productivity loss due to sciatica, and satisfaction with care (appendix p 1). Furthermore, data were collected on health-care resource use and costs related to the delivery of the stratified care intervention and usual non-stratified care, over 12 months. Information was collected about serious adverse events and adverse events. Process outcomes included data on numbers of patients referred to physiotherapy and specialist spinal services, and were collected via patient questionnaires and hospital record reviews from participating NHS services. Where possible, we captured timing of referral and treatment.

We aimed to recruit 470 participants (see the statistical analysis plan in the appendix p 17 for further details) in order to detect a hazard ratio (HR) between 1·4 and 1·5 for time to resolution of symptoms (primary outcome) with 80–90% power, assuming an event (resolution) rate of 60% or greater over 12 months, 20% dropout, and intra-class correlation for clustering by physiotherapist at the level of 0·01 and allowing for a coefficient of variation in physiotherapist cluster size of 0·65.

### Stratified care versus usual care for management of patients presenting with sciatica in primary care (SCOPiC): a randomised controlled trial [^111eqDbj]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Details of intervention costs, health-care resource use and costs, time off work, and quality of life (EQ-5D scores and QALY estimates) are provided in table 3 and in the appendix (pp 5–8) for both arms. Overall, minimal differences were observed in primary care, secondary care, and work outcomes between patients in the two trial arms, with the exception of slightly higher numbers of spinal injections in the stratified care arm versus the usual care arm, but fewer surgeries. As expected, stratified care was also associated with higher treatment costs driven by costs resulting from the fast-track pathway involving an MRI and visit to a spinal interface service. In the cost-utility analysis, stratified care was slightly less effective (QALYs −0·011: 95% CI −0·035 to 0·013) and more costly (£46·21; 95% CI −110·60 to 187·06) than usual care, and was therefore dominated. The net monetary benefit was –£275 if society's willingness to pay for a QALY is valued at £20 000.

Table 3
Cost-utility analysis for stratified care versus usual care

The dominance of usual care is confirmed by the low probability of this model of stratified care being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20 000 (appendix p 11). Sensitivity analyses showed that stratified care was not a cost-effective option from a health-care and societal perspective when the extra information about spinal surgeries and injections from hospital records was included in the analysis (appendix p 7). The subgroup analyses showed considerable uncertainty around the main estimates of the incremental costs and QALYs because of the small sample size in each sciatica group (1, 2, and 3), but overall stratified care remained a non-cost-effective option in all three groups compared with the usual care arm (appendix pp 8, 12).

### Trial of pregabalin for acute and chronic sciatica [^114Voi5Z]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The study PRECISE was published by Stephanie Mathieson and colleagues in 2017 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Low back pain and Sciatica. In the PRECISE study, the trial question was: what is the role of pregabalin in patients with acute and chronic sciatica? In the PRECISE study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the PRECISE study, the population was: 207 patients (115 female, 92 male). The inclusion criteria were outpatients with moderate-to-severe sciatica. The key exclusion criteria were known or suspected serious pathologic condition of the spine; pregnancy; considering or planning spinal surgery for sciatica during the first 8 weeks of the trial; contraindications to pregabalin. In the PRECISE study, the interventions were: n = 106 pregabalin (at a dose of 150 mg/day, adjusted to a maximum dose of 600 mg/day, for up to 8 weeks) n = 101 placebo (matching placebo for up to 8 weeks). In the PRECISE study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in leg pain intensity score at week 8 (3.7 points vs. 3.1 points; MD 0.5, 95% CI -0.2 to 1.2). In the PRECISE study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in leg pain intensity score at week 52 (3.4 points vs. 3 points; MD 0.3, 95% CI -0.5 to 1) No significant difference in extent of disability score on the Roland Disability Questionnaire for Sciatica at week 8 (9.1 points vs. 8.5 points; MD 0.1, 95% CI -1.8 to 2) No significant difference in back pain intensity score at week 8 (3.5 points vs. 3.1 points; MD 0.2, 95% CI -0.6 to 1). In the PRECISE study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events and suicidal thoughts. significant differences in adverse events (64.2% vs. 42.6%), dizziness (39.6% vs. 12.9%). In the PRECISE study, the conclusion was: in outpatients with moderate-to-severe sciatica, pregabalin was not superior to placebo with respect to leg pain intensity score at week 8.

### The efficacy of systematic active conservative treatment for patients with severe sciatica: a single-blind, randomized, clinical, controlled trial [^112Vkh5t]. Spine (2012). Low credibility.

Study Design

Prospective single-blind, randomized, clinical, controlled trial.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of active conservative treatment and to compare 2 active conservative treatment programs for patients with severe sciatica.

Summary Of Background Data

Reviews have demonstrated little or no efficacy for passive conservative treatment modalities in patients suffering from sciatica. The results for surgery are conflicting. Cohort studies have shown excellent results for active treatment modalities in patients with sciatica.

Methods

One hundred eighty-one consecutive patients with radicular pain below the knee were examined at the baseline, at 8 weeks, and at 1 year after the treatment. Participants were randomized into 2 groups: (1) symptom-guided exercises + information + advice to stay active and (2) sham exercises + information + advice to stay active. Symptom-guided exercises consisted of a variety of back-related exercises given in accordance with a written algorithm in which symptoms or response to exercises determined the exercises given (http://www.sygehuslillebaelt.dk/wm345075, click exercises). Sham exercises were optional, designed to increase general blood circulation, and had no targeted effect on the back. The information was comprehensive and included anatomy, pathogenesis, and how discs heal without surgery. The advice included encouragement to stay as active as possible but to reduce activity if leg pain increased. The use of medication was optional, but only paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were recommended.

Results

A mean of 4.8 treatment sessions were provided. All patients experienced statistically significant and clinically important improvements in global assessment, functional status, pain, vocational status, and clinical findings. The symptom-guided exercise group improved significantly more than the sham exercise group in most outcomes.

Conclusion

Active conservative treatment was effective for patients who had symptoms and clinical findings that would normally qualify them for surgery. Although participating patients had greater faith in the sham exercises before treatment, the symptom-guided exercises were superior for most outcomes.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^11695GC2]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Surgery versus usual conservative care

One old study (n = 126) with a high risk of bias compared long-term outcomes of discectomy to conservative management. Both patient and observer ratings demonstrated that discectomy was significantly better than conservative treatment at 1 year. After 1 year, 24 of the 66 patients (36%) in the conservative care group versus 39 of the 60 patients (65%) in the surgery group reported a good outcome. No significant differences in outcomes were reported at 4 and 10 years follow-up.

One small trial (n = 56) with a high risk of bias compared microdiscectomy with conservative treatment in patients with sciatica for 6–12 weeks. Overall, no significant differences were found for leg pain or back pain, and subjective disability throughout the 2 years of follow-up. VAS leg pain scores, however, improved more rapidly in the discectomy group; 6 weeks scores in the surgery group was 12 (SD 20) versus 25 (SD 27) in the conservative group. The per-protocol analysis demonstrated no statistically significant differences.

A large trial (n = 501) with a low risk of bias in patients with sciatica for at least 6 weeks and confirmed disc herniation showed that both the surgery as well as the conservative treatment group improved substantially over 2 years for all primary and secondary outcome measures. The intention-to-treat analysis showed no statistically significant differences for any of the primary outcome measures. Of the patients randomised to surgery, 50% received surgery within 3 months of inclusion as compared with 30% who received surgery in the group randomised to conservative treatment. After 2 years of follow-up, 45% of patients in the conservative treatment group underwent surgery and 40% in the surgery group received conservative treatment.

In conclusion, there is conflicting evidence as to whether surgery is more beneficial than conservative care for short- and long-term follow-up.

### Stratified care versus usual care for management of patients presenting with sciatica in primary care (SCOPiC): a randomised controlled trial [^1113d9HE]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Potential participants were identified by electronic pop-up computer prompts in general practice computer systems triggered by appropriate diagnostic or symptom codes, or by weekly reviews of practice consultation records. Potentially eligible participants were sent information about the SCOPiC research clinic and the trial, and were invited to telephone an administrator to make an appointment at the SCOPiC research clinic to see a physiotherapist. Full eligibility screening and baseline assessments, including identification of each patient's sciatica group according to the stratification algorithm, were done at the research clinic by study physiotherapists.

Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, with a clinical diagnosis of sciatica of any severity and duration following clinical assessment by a physiotherapist in the research clinics, had access to a mobile phone or landline, were not receiving treatment nor had received treatment in the last 3 months for the same problem, were not pregnant, and had no previous lumbar spine surgery. Patients with clinical suspicion (by their general practitioner [GP] or the assessing physiotherapist) of serious spinal pathology (eg, cauda equina syndrome, fracture, spondyloarthropathy, malignancy, infection, or foot drop) or serious physical or mental co-morbidities (as judged by their GP or the assessing physiotherapist) were excluded. The sciatica case definition for this trial was based on the assessing physiotherapist being at least 70% confident in their clinical diagnosis, with at least one of the following being present: leg pain approximating a dermatomal distribution; leg pain worse than or as bad as back pain; leg pain worse with coughing, sneezing, or straining; subjective sensory changes approximating a dermatomal distribution; objective neurological deficits indicative of nerve root compression; positive neural tension test;, and (specifically for spinal claudication or spinal stenosis) leg pain worse with weight-bearing activities and better with sitting. Assessing physiotherapists recorded a specific clinical diagnosis of sciatica due to disc prolapse or stenosis.

### Sciatic neuralgia: a clinical entity… [^116vwSGY]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Sciatica is a reflex neuralgia or a referred pain along the distribution of the sciatic nerve; it should be distinguished from sciatic neuritis, which is an inflammation of the sciatic nerve. The modern attitude, expressed by Feiling, 1 is to think of sciatica as sginifying sciatic pain without connoting any particular pathogenesis. DaCosta2 states that true sciatica is not a neuritis. Moersch3 believes that differentiation of neuralgia from neuritis of the sciatic nerve is of clinical importance. The usual classification of sciatica into primary, secondary and idiopathic groups is inaccurate and, in view of present knowledge, inadequate. More correctly, one may classify, first, sciatic neuritis or a true inflammation of the nerve; secondly, a reflex sciatic neuralgia or essential sciatica. Before the essential reflex neuralgias are described, it is necessary to classify and discuss sciatic neuritis. An inflammation of the sciatic nerve may be either primary or secondary. HAUSER EDW.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1117vs3T]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Implications for clinical practice and policy

International guidelines generally recommend surgical treatment for sciatica secondary to lumbar disc herniation if patients have not responded to comprehensive non-surgical treatment. These recommendations are because many people with acute sciatica will have improvements in their condition over time. Generally, our review supports these recommendations because non-surgical treatment was shown to be able to lead to similar outcomes at long term or even longer follow-ups. However, benefits could vary among different groups of people with sciatica. Attempts have been made to specify who might benefit more from early discectomy for people with sciatica. People with more severe pain in their leg and disability were shown to be more likely to have persistent and debilitating symptoms at 12 months. Thus, this subgroup might benefit from early discectomy because our review has shown that surgical treatment might lead to faster leg pain reduction. Added to that is the evidence that early discectomy is cost effective compared with prolonged non-surgical treatment in the context of the Dutch health system. These findings challenge the notion that non-surgical treatment should always be the first line treatment for sciatica. In people with sciatica who regard rapid pain relief as an important treatment goal, and who feel that the benefits of discectomy outweigh the risks and costs, discectomy could be an early management option.

As a result of the treatment's invasive nature and the substantial costs of surgery, we would encourage clinicians to discuss with their patients that discectomy can provide rapid relief of leg pain, but that non-surgical treatment can achieve similar results, although at a slower pace and with a potential chance of requiring delayed surgery if they do not respond to non-surgical treatment.

Future research

Although discectomy is widely used, the certainty of evidence supporting its use is only low to very low. All trials evaluating discectomy were not blinded and had high crossover rates. Evidence on plasma disc decompression and chemonucleolysis is limited by the low number of studies and small sample sizes. Large placebo controlled trials evaluating surgical treatment for sciatica have the potential to advance this field. However, the use of placebo controls in surgical trials has challenges. Furthermore, investigations into which group of people with sciatica are likely to benefit from early surgery is also key for clinicians to make individualised recommendations.

### Efficacy of naproxen in patients with sciatica: multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116CxuVV]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

This trial assessed the efficacy of naproxen in patients with sciatica in outpatient clinics across 4 Norwegian hospitals. A total of 123 adults with radiating pain below the knee (≥ 4 on a 0–10 numeric rating scale) and signs consistent with nerve root involvement were included. Participants were randomized to receive either naproxen 500 mg or a placebo twice daily for 10 days. The primary outcome, daily leg pain intensity measured on a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale throughout the treatment period, revealed a statistically significant difference in favor of naproxen, with an adjusted mean difference of -0.5 (95% CI -0.8 to -0.1, P = 0.015). In the naproxen group, the treatment effect was significantly related to time, and over the whole 10-day period, the average adjusted difference was -0.6 (95% CI -0.8 to -0.5). Mean numbers needed to treat for 30% and 50% improvement were 9.9 (95% CI 4.7–15.0) and 20.7 (8.7–32.7), respectively. The adjusted mean difference for back pain was -0.4 (95% CI -0.8 to 0.0), and for Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire for Sciatica, it was -1.5 (95% CI -3.0 to 0.0). No differences were found for sciatica bothersomeness or consumption of rescue medication or opioids. Participants in the naproxen group exhibited an adjusted odds ratio of 4.7 (95% CI 1.3–16.2) for improvement by 1 level on the global perceived change scale. In conclusion, naproxen treatment showed small, likely clinically unimportant benefits compared with placebo in patients with moderate-to-severe sciatica.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115xwyUk]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Data extraction

Two authors extracted data independently and were reviewed by a third author. We extracted data according to the hierarchy of between group differences (ie, mean difference) and 95% confidence intervals, post-treatment means and standard deviations, and then pretreatment to post-treatment within group change scores. When standard deviations were not reported, the Cochrane's RevMan calculator was used to estimate standard deviations. When it was not possible to estimate standard deviations, we borrowed them from a similar study included in the review. When data were not available in the published manuscript, we sought to extract data from the trial registry, if available.

We classified follow-up times into immediate term (≤ six weeks), short term (> six weeks and ≤ three months), medium term (> three and < 12 months), and long term (at 12 months). In studies with multiple time points, we extracted data from the time point closest to six weeks and to months three, six, and 12. Outcomes longer than 12 months were also extracted.

Outcomes

The primary outcomes were leg pain intensity (eg, Numerical Pain Rating Scale, Visual Analogue Scale) and disability (eg, Oswestry Disability Index, Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire). Secondary outcomes were back pain intensity, health related quality of life (eg, short form-36), adverse events (any adverse event and serious adverse events as defined by each study), and satisfaction with treatment (eg, Likert Scale).

### Physical therapy referral from primary care for acute back pain with sciatica: a randomized controlled trial [^111KeHnR]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Few studies have examined primary care management for acute sciatica, including referral to physical therapy.

Objective

To evaluate whether early referral to physical therapy reduced disability more than usual care (UC) alone for patients with acute sciatica.

Design

Randomized controlled clinical trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02391350).

Setting

2 health care systems in Salt Lake City, Utah.

Patients

220 adults aged 18 to 60 years with sciatica of less than 90 days' duration who were making an initial primary care consultation.

Intervention

All participants received imaging and medication at the discretion of the primary care provider before enrollment. A total of 110 participants randomly assigned to UC were provided 1 session of education, and 110 participants randomly assigned to early physical therapy (EPT) were provided 1 education session and then referred for 4 weeks of physical therapy, including exercise and manual therapy.

Measurements

The primary outcome was the Oswestry Disability Index (OSW) score after 6 months. Secondary outcomes were pain intensity, patient-reported treatment success, health care use, and missed workdays.

Results

Participants in the EPT group had greater improvement from baseline to 6 months for the primary outcome (relative difference, -5.4 points [95% CI, -9.4 to -1.3 points]; P = 0.009). The OSW and several secondary outcomes favored EPT after 4 weeks. After 1 year, between-group differences favored EPT for the OSW (relative difference, -4.8 points [CI, -8.9 to -0.7 points]) and back pain intensity (relative difference, -1.0 points [CI, -1.6 to -0.4 points]). The EPT group was more likely to self-report treatment success after 1 year (45.2%) than the UC group (27.6%) (relative risk, 1.6 [CI, 1.1 to 2.4]). There were no significant differences in health care use or missed workdays.

Limitation

The patients and providers were unblinded, and specific physical therapy interventions responsible for effects could not be determined.

Conclusion

Referral from primary care to physical therapy for recent-onset sciatica improved disability and other outcomes compared with UC.

### Cost-effectiveness of different strategies to manage patients with sciatica [^1153ozow]. Pain (2014). Low credibility.

The aim of this paper is to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of treatment regimens for managing patients with sciatica. A deterministic model structure was constructed based on information from the findings from a systematic review of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, published sources of unit costs, and expert opinion. The assumption was that patients presenting with sciatica would be managed through one of 3 pathways (primary care, stepped approach, immediate referral to surgery). Results were expressed as incremental cost per patient with symptoms successfully resolved. Analysis also included incremental cost per utility gained over a 12-month period. One-way sensitivity analyses were used to address uncertainty. The model demonstrated that none of the strategies resulted in 100% success. For initial treatments, the most successful regime in the first pathway was nonopioids, with a probability of success of 0.613. In the second pathway, the most successful strategy was nonopioids, followed by biological agents, followed by epidural/nerve block and disk surgery, with a probability of success of 0.996. Pathway 3 (immediate surgery) was not cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses identified that the use of the highest cost estimates results in a similar overall picture. While the estimates of cost per quality-adjusted life year are higher, the economic model demonstrated that stepped approaches based on initial treatment with nonopioids are likely to represent the most cost-effective regimens for the treatment of sciatica. However, development of alternative economic modelling approaches is required.

### Cascade of decisions meet personal preferences in sciatica treatment decisions [^112jSf5S]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

The results of this study give insight into the critical decision-making steps in the care pathway of sciatica. The two key elements are: (1) diagnosis of the problem and (2) deciding on the type of treatment. The position that patients and their physicians took differed, also within the groups of patients and physicians.

For patients, certainty about their diagnosis was most important. They preferred the evidence of MRI. This is congruent with earlier research, which showed that patients placed much emphasis on the need for a confirmed diagnosis, as a starting point for further treatment decisions. Patients' preference for imaging is well known, although not fully understood. A systematic review of qualitative studies about patients with low back pain and sciatica concluded that for patients, imaging gives more certainty and excludes other possible explanations. The patients we interviewed experienced the first weeks of GP-led conservative treatment as mandatory waiting time before they would receive a scan for confirmation.

Physicians seldom felt that they required imaging to confirm the diagnosis. This holds especially for neurologists and neurosurgeons. This is concurrent with research that showed that 89% of Dutch neurologists only order imaging under specific circumstances, such as after a long period of pain or with an abnormal neurological exam. For 27% of these neurologists, the patient requesting for an MRI is also sufficient reason to order imaging. For physicians, the presentation of sciatica is often so recognisable that confirmation by imaging is not required. Patients find this difficult to grasp.

Among physicians, the timing of intervention was the main subject of discussion. Physicians differed strongly in their opinions about the benefits of surgical or conservative treatment, especially with regard to the timing of surgery. In the Dutch context, the neurologist appears to be the most influential decision-maker here: he or she can accelerate or delay the decision to pursue surgical treatment, and decides about the timing of involvement of the neurosurgeon. Between approximately 6 weeks and 6 months after complaints have started, patients with persisting symptoms see a neurologist, who, with the patient, drives the decision about conservative treatment or surgical intervention. Without referral to a neurosurgeon, surgery is highly unlikely within the Dutch context. Of course, neurosurgeons can delay surgery further. Yet, they are unable to make it happen earlier.

Placebo controlled trials

Fifteen randomised clinical trials compared drugs with placebo with individual effect sizes calculated for nine trials (fig 2). For five trials investigating NSAIDs, corticosteroids, antidepressants, and muscle relaxants, we did not calculate effect sizes as percentage of improved patients was reported as an outcome.

### Cascade of decisions meet personal preferences in sciatica treatment decisions [^117YC1dX]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Sciatica can be managed both conservatively and surgically. In the Netherlands, sciatica care is organised following the stepped care principle, involving a general practitioner (GP) as gatekeeper for hospital care, and a hospital-based neurologist, before a neurosurgeon is consulted. Therefore, a chain of decisions and referrals precede surgery. Both the diagnostic process and timing of surgical treatment and the (societal) value of surgery over conservative treatment are topics of ongoing discussion, and practice variation has been widely reported. This practice variation may be driven by both differences between and within patient and provider preferences. This makes the management of sciatica of interest. Which preferences of patients and physician(s) shape these decisions?

In the Netherlands, the GP is the point of entry for non-acute health complaints. For sciatica, the GP guideline advises conservative treatment for 6–8 weeks, combining a strategy of watchful waiting, informing the patient and providing painkillers. If the patients' complaints last longer, the GP can refer to a neurologist. Neurologists can confirm the diagnosis and might order imaging. However, the neurologists' guideline advises against imaging, unless surgery is considered or there is doubt about underlying cause or pathology. Recent research showed that only 11% of Dutch neurologists routinely order imaging. Apart from conservative options, the neurologist can also prescribe more invasive pain treatments, usually performed by a pain team. In case of persisting complaints, the patient might be referred to a neurosurgeon or orthopaedic surgeon to consider surgery. The Dutch neurosurgery guideline advices not to perform surgery on patients with less than 8 weeks of complaints, and proposes surgery after more than 6 months of complaints without any proper improvement. In the intermediary period natural recovery could occur. Therefore, a shared decision on treatment should be pursued with the patient. A multidisciplinary guideline exists, of which the implementation faces difficulties.

Radicular pain algorithm — epidural injection evidence and next steps note that disc protrusion, herniation, and prolapse resulting in sciatica are seen in less than 5% of patients with low back pain; patients non-responsive to epidural injections will require either mechanical disc decompression, percutaneous adhesiolysis, or implantation of a spinal cord stimulator or intrathecal infusion systems depending on clinical factors, and there is good evidence for caudal, lumbar interlaminar, and lumbar transforaminal epidural injections in managing radicular pain or disc herniation, while the evidence is fair for these approaches in managing spinal stenosis.

### Do not routinely offer imaging for uncomplicated low back pain [^112sULD9]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

The clinical problem

The past two decades have seen a paradigm shift in the way we use imaging when managing low back pain (LBP). Imaging was once a routine part of the diagnostic workup for most cases of LBP. Evidence now indicates that imaging is useful only in the small subgroup of patients for whom there is suspicion of red flag conditions. These conditions include cancer, infection, inflammatory disease, fracture, and severe neurological deficits — which together account for only 5–10% of LBP presentations in primary care. For the remaining 90–95% of LBP cases (called non-specific or uncomplicated LBP), imaging will not guide management and can cause more harm than benefit. International guidelinesand "Choosing Wisely" campaigns now encourage a diagnostic triage approach to identify those patients who require imaging (box 1). Given these advances in knowledge, imaging rates for LBP should be decreasing, but recent systematic reviews show the opposite, reporting that imaging has increased over the past 20 yearsand that at least a third of all images are unnessary.

Box 1
"Choosing Wisely" statements from different countries related to avoiding the use of routine imaging for low back pain

"Don't routinely image patients with low back pain regardless of the duration of symptoms unless: (a) there are clinical reasons to suspect serious underlying pathology (i.e. red flags), or (b) imaging is necessary for the planning and/or execution of a particular evidenced-based therapeutic intervention on a specific spinal condition". — Canadian Spine Society, Choosing Wisely Canada
"Do not undertake imaging for low back pain in patients without indications of a serious underlying condition". — Australian Rheumatology Association, Choosing Wisely Australia
"Do not routinely offer imaging in a non-specialist setting for people with low back pain with or without sciatica. Consider imaging in specialist settings of care (for example, a musculoskeletal interface clinic or hospital) for people with low back pain with or without sciatica only if the result is likely to change management". — Royal College of Physicians, Choosing Wisely UK

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112unCo8]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To investigate the effectiveness and safety of surgery compared with non-surgical treatment for sciatica.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sources

Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from database inception to June 2022.

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies

Randomised controlled trials comparing any surgical treatment with non-surgical treatment, epidural steroid injections, or placebo or sham surgery, in people with sciatica of any duration due to lumbar disc herniation (diagnosed by radiological imaging).

Data extraction and synthesis

Two independent reviewers extracted data. Leg pain and disability were the primary outcomes. Adverse events, back pain, quality of life, and satisfaction with treatment were the secondary outcomes. Pain and disability scores were converted to a scale of 0 (no pain or disability) to 100 (worst pain or disability). Data were pooled using a random effects model. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool and certainty of evidence with the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) framework. Follow-up times were into immediate term (≤ six weeks), short term (> six weeks and ≤ three months), medium term (> three and < 12 months), and long term (at 12 months).

Results

24 trials were included, half of these investigated the effectiveness of discectomy compared with non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections (1711 participants). Very low to low certainty evidence showed that discectomy, compared with non-surgical treatment, reduced leg pain: the effect size was moderate at immediate term (mean difference −12.1 (95% confidence interval −23.6 to −0.5)) and short term (−11.7 (−18.6 to −4.7)), and small at medium term (−6.5 (−11.0 to −2.1)). Negligible effects were noted at long term (−2.3 (−4.5 to −0.2)). For disability, small, negligible, or no effects were found. A similar effect on leg pain was found when comparing discectomy with epidural steroid injections. For disability, a moderate effect was found at short term, but no effect was observed at medium and long term. The risk of any adverse events was similar between discectomy and non-surgical treatment (risk ratio 1.34 (95% confidence interval 0.91 to 1.98)).

Conclusion

Very low to low certainty evidence suggests that discectomy was superior to non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections in reducing leg pain and disability in people with sciatica with a surgical indication, but the benefits declined over time. Discectomy might be an option for people with sciatica who feel that the rapid relief offered by discectomy outweighs the risks and costs associated with surgery.

### Early surgery for sciatica [^11242oAe]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Studies that evaluated plasma disc decompression and chemonucleolysis were also included, but the small number did not permit firm recommendations. Commendably, the authors carefully rated the certainty of evidence, which was low or very low. The true effect could, therefore, be markedly different from the reported estimates, allowing only weak clinical recommendations. This certainty of evidence is disappointing considering that 11 of the 12 trials evaluating discectomy were reported after the CONSORT reporting guidelines were published. The authors concluded that "discectomy might be an option for people with sciatica who feel that the rapid relief offered by discectomy outweighs the risks and costs associated with surgery".

So, does that mean that people with sciatica should be offered surgery because they will experience more rapid improvements in pain and disability compared with non-surgical interventions? As always, context is key when interpreting study findings. In this systematic review, although not specifically mentioned by the research authors, most of the trials that examined the effect of discectomy recruited patients from secondary care. According to the stepped care approach recommended by international guidelines, secondary care referral should only be initiated for people who have not responded to conservative care or have severe radicular weakness. Furthermore, to be considered for surgery, patients require a surgical indication such as a structural target on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Accordingly, this systematic review included only trials of people with discogenic sciatica diagnosed by MRI. However, only 30% of patients in secondary care have an MRI finding that matches the spinal level predicted by clinical examination and thus represents a clear surgical indication. The results of this systematic review therefore relate to a much smaller and more defined group than the heterogeneous population with sciatica encountered in community healthcare settings.

### Surgical microdiscectomy versus transforaminal epidural steroid injection in patients with sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc (NERVES): a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation [^113BAPqA]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Background

The optimal invasive treatment for sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc remains controversial, with a paucity of evidence for use of non-surgical treatments such as transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI) over surgical microdiscectomy. We aimed to investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of these options for management of radicular pain secondary to herniated lumbar disc.

Methods

We did a pragmatic, multicentre, phase 3, open-label, randomised controlled trial at 11 spinal units across the UK. Eligible patients were aged 16–65 years, had MRI-confirmed non-emergency sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc with symptom duration between 6 weeks and 12 months, and had leg pain that was not responsive to non-invasive management. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either TFESI or surgical microdiscectomy by an online randomisation system that was stratified by centre with random permuted blocks. The primary outcome was Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODQ) score at 18 weeks. All randomly assigned participants who completed a valid ODQ at baseline and at 18 weeks were included in the analysis. Safety analysis included all treated participants. Cost-effectiveness was estimated from the EuroQol-5D-5L, Hospital Episode Statistics, medication usage, and self-reported resource-use data. This trial was registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN04820368, and EudraCT, number 2014–002751–25.

Findings

Between March 6, 2015, and Dec 21, 2017, 163 (15%) of 1055 screened patients were enrolled, with 80 participants (49%) randomly assigned to the TFESI group and 83 participants (51%) to the surgery group. At week 18, ODQ scores were 30·02 (SD 24·38) for 63 assessed patients in the TFESI group and 22·30 (19·83) for 61 assessed patients in the surgery group. Mean improvement was 24·52 points (18·89) for the TFESI group and 26·74 points (21·35) for the surgery group, with an estimated treatment difference of -4·25 (95% CI -11·09 to 2·59; p = 0·22). There were four serious adverse events in four participants associated with surgery, and none with TFESI. Compared with TFESI, surgery had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £38737 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, and a 0·17 probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20000 per quality-adjusted life-year.

Interpretation

For patients with sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc, with symptom duration of up to 12 months, TFESI should be considered as a first invasive treatment option. Surgery is unlikely to be a cost-effective alternative to TFESI.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^115EuZHV]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Management of sciatica varies considerably. Patients are commonly treated in primary care but a small proportion is referred to secondary care and may eventually undergo surgery if complaints remain present for at least 6 weeks. Conservative treatment for sciatica is primarily aimed at pain reduction, either by analgesics or by reducing pressure on the nerve root. There seems to be consensus that surgery is indicated in carefully selected patients for sciatica in presence of a herniated lumbar disc, or severe sciatica with serious or progressive neurologic deficits and imaging demonstrating lumbar disc herniation at the nerve root level correlating with the patient's examination findings. The primary rationale of surgery for sciatica is that surgery will relieve nerve root irritation or compression due to herniated disc material. The most common type of surgery is open microdiscectomy, surgical removal of part of the disc, performed with or without the use of an operating microscope or other magnifying tools. Other minimally invasive surgical techniques, such as endoscopic surgery have recently been developed. In the absence of serious neurologic deficits or for persistent non-radicular low back pain, consensus whether surgery is useful or not has not yet been established. Furthermore, the timing of the intervention with respect to prolonged conservative care has not been evaluated properly.

At present, several randomised trials have been published that have compared surgery with conservative treatment. The objective of this systematic review is to compare and summarise the evidence regarding the effectiveness of surgery compared with conservative treatment for patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111jfPh3]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

There is at best only low quality evidence to judge the efficacy and tolerability of drugs commonly prescribed for the management of sciatica in primary care. The available evidence does not clearly show favourable effects of NSAIDs, corticosteroids, antidepressants, or opioid analgesics in the immediate term, even compared with placebo. Evidence from a single trial and one meta-analysis with two trials provides some limited support ("low quality" and "moderate quality" evidence) for the use of NSAIDs and corticosteroids to relieve pain in the short term in patients with acute sciatica. In one small sample trial there was also limited support ("low quality" evidence) for the short term relief of pain in chronic sciatica with an anticonvulsant drug. At present these data provide a lack of conclusive and high quality evidence to guide the prescription of these drugs for patients with sciatica in primary care.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^111vr5QA]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The effectiveness of surgery in patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniations is not without dispute. The goal of this study was to assess the effects of surgery versus conservative therapy (including epidural injections) for patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation. A comprehensive search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and PEDro up to October 2009. Randomised controlled trials of adults with lumbar radicular pain, which evaluated at least one clinically relevant outcome measure (pain, functional status, perceived recovery, lost days of work) were included. Two authors assessed risk of bias according to Cochrane criteria and extracted the data. In total, five studies were identified, two of which with a low risk of bias. One study compared early surgery with prolonged conservative care followed by surgery if needed; three studies compared surgery with usual conservative care, and one study compared surgery with epidural injections. Data were not pooled because of clinical heterogeneity and poor reporting of data. One large low-risk-of-bias trial demonstrated that early surgery in patients with 6–12 weeks of radicular pain leads to faster pain relief when compared with prolonged conservative treatment, but there were no differences after 1 and 2 years. Another large low-risk-of-bias trial between surgery and usual conservative care found no statistically significant differences on any of the primary outcome measures after 1 and 2 years. Future studies should evaluate who benefits more from surgery and who from conservative care.

### Timing of surgery for sciatica: subgroup analysis alongside a randomized trial [^1172ZxJJ]. European Spine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sciatica is characterized by radiating pain in an area of the leg typically served by one lumbar or sacral spinal nerve root and is sometimes associated with sensory and motor deficit. Apart from infrequent causes, sciatica is mostly due to a herniated lumbar disc. Because of the high prevalence in general practice and the major impact of low back disorders on society, surgery is frequently performed to speed up recovery of sciatica. Probably as a result of socio-cultural circumstances, different timing of surgical removal of the herniated portion of the disc appears to vary greatly in the western countries. Recently the option of surgery was offered to patients after only 6 weeks of unremitting sciatica. The major reason to offer early surgery was the unattractive alternative: the slow natural course of sciatica, occasionally extending over 4 years. Globally two options were available: (1) early surgery and (2) prolonged conservative care, possibly with surgery at a later date. Since surgery is economically affordable and relatively safe, most patients in western countries prefer early surgery rather than to wait for months or even years, risking long term work-disability and presence of chronic pain. Recently this study provided evidence that the prolonged conservative care strategy resulted in complete recovery at 1 year as similar as the surgical strategy, but it took twice as long compared to early surgery. The 1-year effects of the two assigned treatment strategies were similar as far as function and pain were concerned in the randomized cohorts. The contribution of this study is that patients, opting for early surgery, now are able to base their decision on realistic data about the alternative strategy, with similar outcomes at 1 and 2 years compared to early surgery. Individual decisions regarding early surgery or not are still difficult to make. Since treatment effects can differ between subgroups of patients, this might influence the indication for early disc surgery.

Therefore, it would be of great interest to patients and physicians to define determinants which occur early in the course of sciatica and predict the speed of recovery with either prolonged conservative care or early surgery. Insight in these determinants may help in the decision about when to perform surgery. We carried out a subgroup analysis of data from the aforementioned randomized trial to evaluate anamnestic, neurological and radiological variables which might in theory influence the difference in rate of recovery between the two treatment strategies.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^114VnjGL]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In general, there is evidence that early surgery in patients with sciatica provides for a better short-term relief of leg pain as compared to prolonged conservative care, but the evidence is low quality because of the fact that only one trial investigated this properly. No significant differences were found between surgery and usual conservative care in any of the clinical outcomes after 1 and 2 years, but the evidence is of very low quality. The scarcity of studies as well as the limited quality of the studies does not support the choice for any timing in our current guidelines.

Future studies should evaluate who benefits more from surgery and who from conservative care. Also economic evaluations should analyse the economical gain of the potential faster recovery against increased cost and complication rate of surgery.

Risk of bias and certainty of evidence

Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias (selection, performance, detection, attrition, and reporting bias) of included trials using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We assessed funding and conflict of interest statements as part of assessing other bias (eg, industry funded trials without declaration of investigator autonomy was judged to be at high risk; supplemental file 11). We rated the certainty of evidence for each of the outcomes by using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) framework. For each GRADE domain, the quality of evidence was downgraded by one level if a serious flaw was present, that is: risk of bias (> 25% of participants in this comparison were from studies at high risk of bias (supplemental file 3), inconsistency (substantial unexplained interstudy heterogeneity, I 2 > 50), imprecision (95% confidence interval were 20 points different to the point estimates), and, and small study effects (> 25% of participants were from small studies (< 100 participants per arm)). Certainty of evidence was rated as high, moderate, low, or very low. Any discrepancies between the evaluation of risk of bias and certainty of evidence were resolved through consensus, or, when required, by arbitration with a third reviewer.

### Evaluation and treatment of acute low back pain [^111B5nVx]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Acute low back pain with or without sciatica usually is self-limited and has no serious underlying pathology. For most patients, reassurance, pain medications, and advice to stay active are sufficient. A more thorough evaluation is required in selected patients with "red flag" findings associated with an increased risk of cauda equina syndrome, cancer, infection, or fracture. These patients also require closer follow-up and, in some cases, urgent referral to a surgeon. In patients with nonspecific mechanical low back pain, imaging can be delayed for at least four to six weeks, which usually allows the pain to improve. There is good evidence for the effectiveness of acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, skeletal muscle relaxants, heat therapy, physical therapy, and advice to stay active. Spinal manipulative therapy may provide short-term benefits compared with sham therapy but not when compared with conventional treatments. Evidence for the benefit of acupuncture is conflicting, with higher-quality trials showing no benefit. Patient education should focus on the natural history of the back pain, its overall good prognosis, and recommendations for effective treatments.

### Surgical microdiscectomy versus transforaminal epidural steroid injection in patients with sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc (NERVES): a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation [^114ogTWp]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Methods

Study design

NERVES is a pragmatic, multicentre, phase 3, randomised controlled trial, with an internal pilot phase, comparing surgical microdiscectomy with TFESI in patients with sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc with symptom duration of up to 12 months. Participants were recruited from and followed up at 11 spinal tertiary units (outpatient neurosurgical, pain, and orthopaedic clinics; appendix pp 2–3) across the UK. The initial plan was to limit duration of symptoms at screening to 6 months. However, this criterion had a negative impact on recruitment because few patients were receiving specialist treatment within the NHS by this time, so the protocol was extended to 1 year of symptoms. The main aim of treatment was to relieve sciatica symptoms in patients as quickly and safely as possible.

An independent trial steering committee viewed reports with treatment assignment concealed, and an independent data monitoring committee viewed unmasked reports regularly to assess conduct and progress, including safety.

The trial was granted(reference 21322/004/001) by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. The trial protocol was also approved by a research ethics committee (National Research Ethics Service Committee North West–Liverpool Central; reference 14/NW/1219) and has been published.

Participants

All participants required an MRI diagnosis of nerve compression secondary to herniated lumbar disc and had leg pain that was non-responsive to at least one attempt of conservative, non-invasive management. A screening log was maintained at each trial centre, with information on eligibility, consent, and randomisation. Eligible participants were aged 16–65 years, had clinical evaluation of leg pain by a consultant spinal surgeon that was deemed concordant with nerve compression seen on MRI, and had a duration of symptoms between 6 weeks and 12 months. Patients with emergency cases of significant ankle weakness or threatened cauda equina syndrome were excluded, as were those with far lateral disc prolapses. A full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is in the appendix (p 2). Eligible participants provided written informed consent before participating in the trial.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111F2Kgh]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Sciatica is a common condition with a lifetime prevalence of up to 43%. In approximately 85–90% of cases, a herniated disc causes lumbar nerve root compression or inflammation. Although the prognosis for patients with acute sciatica is generally favourable, 20–30% of patients still experience pain after a year.

Guidelines recommend a stepwise model of treatment for sciatica starting with non-surgical treatment such as exercise, then progressing to pharmacological and interventional treatment if the pain is refractory. When non-surgical treatments have not been effective, surgery can then be considered if radiological findings are consistent with symptoms. Discectomy is the most common surgical treatment for sciatica due to disc herniation. Around 180 000 discectomies are done in the USA per year, and an increasing trend in its use has been reported in many high-income countries over the past 20 years. However, evidence supporting surgical treatment for sciatica is uncertain.

Recent systematic reviews on this topic have several shortcomings. They have collated data from heterogeneous populations (eg, people with lumbar disc herniation, stenosis, and spondylolisthesis), which have distinct clinical courses and require different surgical procedures. Others have excluded studies published in languages other than English, newly published trials, and trials that compared surgery to other commonly used interventional treatments, such as epidural injections. Another network meta-analysis combined data from different time points. A nuanced interpretation of the outcomes for pain and disability was not given. Hence, current evidence supporting surgery for sciatica is undetermined and warrants a comprehensive update. The objective of this systematic review was to investigate the effectiveness or efficacy and safety of surgical treatment, compared with non-surgical treatment, in people with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation.

### Stratified care versus usual care for management of patients presenting with sciatica in primary care (SCOPiC): a randomised controlled trial [^1153tXhW]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Added value of this study

Before this trial, a UK Spinal Taskforce in 2013 highlighted the need for better information about the clinical and cost-effectiveness of early referral of patients with severe symptoms of sciatica for consideration of secondary care treatments such as surgery or spinal injections. The findings of this trial provide the first evidence about the clinical and cost-effectiveness of stratified care, including a fast-track pathway, for patients consulting in primary care with sciatica.

Implications of all the available evidence

In a primary care setting, where most patients with sciatica are assessed and managed, our findings do not support a transition from the mainly stepped care model to this stratified care model. However, testing ways to deliver care systematically to patients with sciatica could help to reduce practice variation. Taking into account that the key prognostic factors relevant in non-specific low back pain are not consistent prognostic factors in sciatica, further research is needed to explore different stratified care models for this population.

### Stratified care versus usual care for management of patients presenting with sciatica in primary care (SCOPiC): a randomised controlled trial [^113D4tKN]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Summary

Background

Sciatica has a substantial impact on individuals and society. Stratified care has been shown to lead to better outcomes among patients with non-specific low back pain, but it has not been tested for sciatica. We aimed to investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of stratified care versus non-stratified usual care for patients presenting with sciatica in primary care.

Methods

We did a two-parallel arm, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial across three centres in the UK (North Staffordshire, North Shropshire/Wales, and Cheshire). Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had a clinical diagnosis of sciatica, access to a mobile phone or landline number, were not pregnant, were not currently receiving treatment for the same problem, and had no previous spinal surgery. Patients were recruited from general practices and randomly assigned (1:1) by a remote web-based service to stratified care or usual care, stratified by centre and stratification group allocation. In the stratified care arm, a combination of prognostic and clinical criteria associated with referral to spinal specialist services were used to allocate patients to one of three groups for matched care pathways. Group 1 was offered brief advice and support in up to two physiotherapy sessions; group 2 was offered up to six physiotherapy sessions; and group 3 was fast-tracked to MRI and spinal specialist assessment within 4 weeks of randomisation. The primary outcome was self-reported time to first resolution of sciatica symptoms, defined as "completely recovered" or "much better" on a 6-point ordinal scale, collected via text messages or telephone calls. Analyses were by intention to treat. Health-care costs and cost-effectiveness were also assessed. This trial is registered on the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN75449581.

Findings

Between May 28, 2015, and July 18, 2017, 476 patients from 42 general practices around three UK centres were randomly assigned to stratified care or usual care (238 in each arm). For the primary outcome, the overall response rate was 89% (9467 of 10 601 text messages sent; 4688 [88%] of 5310 in the stratified care arm and 4779 [90%] of 5291 in the usual care arm). Median time to symptom resolution was 10 weeks (95% CI 6·4–13·6) in the stratified care arm and 12 weeks (9·4–14·6) in the usual care arm, with the survival analysis showing no significant difference between the arms (hazard ratio 1·14 [95% CI 0·89–1·46]). Stratified care was not cost-effective compared to usual care.

Interpretation

The stratified care model for patients with sciatica consulting in primary care was not better than usual care for either clinical or health economic outcomes. These results do not support a transition to this stratified care model for patients with sciatica.

### Cascade of decisions meet personal preferences in sciatica treatment decisions [^115dJ6rf]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Results

Four steps in the care process proved relevant for the clinical pathway of patients. These were uncertainty about the diagnosis, analgesia, epidural injections and surgery. Patients and physicians differed in opinion on the subjects of a certain diagnosis and analgesia. They had relatively similar opinions with respect to the different treatment options. Different options existed on the topic of surgical treatment, within both the group of patients as well as the group of physicians. A summary of the positions of patients and physicians on the four steps is presented in table 3.

Table 3
A summary of the perspectives of patients and physicians on the four main topics

Certainty and diagnosis

After the onset of sciatica, two prominent decisions or conflicts appear, concerning (1) diagnosing sciatica and the need for MRI-imaging to confirm the diagnosis and (2) the appropriate timing for referral to the hospital. Physicians felt confident about diagnosing sciatica, although the GPs mentioned that they sometimes doubted their diagnosis. They would discuss such doubts with their patients and generally would wait to see how symptoms developed. GPs acknowledged that their first objective in patients with subjected sciatica is to help the patient through the first period of pain and restricted mobility, rather than to determine the 'true' diagnosis rapidly. When patients did not improve, or pushed for referral, GPs would refer to a neurologist earlier than the 6–8 weeks suggested in the guideline. However, because of waiting lists, these patients often waited a few weeks before a specialist was available, and the total duration of complaints generally exceeded 6 weeks.

Patients understood the 6–8 weeks of conservative treatment by the GP as mandatory 'waiting time', after which their diagnosis would be confirmed by a specialist and with an MRI scan. When a neurologist deemed the scan to be unnecessary, patients were disappointed. Physicians were conscious of such patient expectations. Some kept refusing, others gave in:

Sometimes you notice within a minute that whatever you say, it won't matter.… And in such cases you can say 'according to the guideline you are not entitled to a scan'. But I am not treating the guideline, I am treating the patient. In my experience, if you do not refer such a patient for a scan, if you do not manage to get the patient to understand, and you kind of quarrel with the patient, next month you will receive information from another hospital and they'll have made the scan.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^113LfU5c]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Strengths and limitations

There are some limitations in our present review. Firstly, the limited amount of studies, especially those with a low risk of bias, limits the strength of our recommendations. The GRADE approach needs consistent findings in separate studies to raise the level of evidence to 'moderate' or 'high'. The overall quality of the evidence should not be misinterpreted as the quality of an individual study.

A more general problem lies within the methodology of research for the assessment of timing of interventions. Current research models, with the randomised clinical trial as the gold standard, do not allow for a proper analysis of the difference between the time from inclusion (or onset of symptoms) to intervention and prolonged control intervention. The design and analysis of studies is complicated by the difference in cross-over possibilities between the two interventions. Crossing over from conservative treatment to surgery is to be expected for a certain amount of patients. The reverse is also possible as shown in the study of Weinstein et al. The mechanism is however different as crossing over is only counted as surgery did not take place at all.

The clinical data seem to favour surgery slightly; however, the costs of surgery are likely to be higher than conservative treatment for patients or the health care system. Also, potential complications are probably more prevalent and more severe with surgery. Only from a societal perspective it might be more cost-effective because of lower cost of production loss. Evaluating conservative treatment and surgical intervention requires a different set of outcome parameters, including complications, re-surgeries and economical information to allow for a balanced and informed cost-complication-effectiveness decision.

### Advice to stay active as a single treatment for low back pain and sciatica [^111neChg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Low back pain is one of the most common conditions managed in primary care. Restricted activity, rest, and symptomatic analgesics are the most commonly prescribed treatment for low back pain and sciatica.

Objectives

To assess the effects of advice to stay active as single treatment for patients with low back pain.

Search Strategy

Computerised searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Sport, The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Musculoskeletal Group's Trials Register and Scisearch, and scanning of reference lists from relevant articles were undertaken. Relevant studies were also traced by contacting authors. Date of the most recent searches: December 1998.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised trials or quasi-randomised trials where the study population consisted of adult patients with low back pain or sciatica, in which one comparison group was advised to stay active. The main outcomes of interest were pain, functional status, recovery and return to work.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the validity of included trials and extracted data. Investigators were contacted to collect missing data or for clarification when needed.

Main Results

Four trials, with a total of 491 patients, were included. Advice to stay active was compared to advice to rest in bed in all trials. Two trials were assessed to have low risk of bias and two to have moderate to high risk of bias. The results were heterogeneous. Results from one high quality trial of patients with acute simple LBP found small differences in functional status [Weighted Mean Difference (on a 0–100 scale) 6.0 (95% CI: 1.5, 10.5)] and length of sick leave [WMD 3.4 days (95% CI: 1.6, 5.2)] in favour of staying active compared to advice to stay in bed for two days. The other high quality trial compared advice to stay active with advice to rest in bed for 14 days for patients with sciatic syndrome, and found no differences between the groups. One of the high quality trials also compared advice to stay active with exercises for patients with acute simple LBP, and found improvement in functional status and reduction in sick leave in favour of advice to stay active.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The best available evidence suggests that advice to stay active alone has small beneficial effects for patients with acute simple low back pain, and little or no effect for patients with sciatica. There is no evidence that advice to stay active is harmful for either acute low back pain or sciatica. If there is no major difference between advice to stay active and advice to rest in bed, and there is potential harmful effects of prolonged bed rest, then it is reasonable to advise people with acute low back pain and sciatica to stay active. These conclusions are based on single trials.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for sciatica [^112sWKPY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the most frequently prescribed drugs for the treatment of sciatica. A previous Cochrane review on the efficacy of NSAIDs summarised findings for acute and chronic low back pain (LBP) and sciatica. This is an update of the original review (2008) focusing on people suffering from sciatica.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of NSAIDs in pain reduction, overall improvement, and reported side effects in people with sciatica.

Search Methods

We performed electronic searches up to 24 June 2015 in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and two trials registers. We searched reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews on the topics for additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (double-blind, single-blind, and open-label) that assessed the efficacy of NSAIDs in sciatica. We included all trials that compared NSAIDs to placebo, to other NSAIDs, or to other medication. Additional interventions were allowed if there was a clear contrast for the treatment with NSAIDs in the trial.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted the data. Where feasible we calculated pooled results using Review Manager 5.3. We reported pain relief outcomes using mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). We used risk ratios (RR) with 95% CI to report global improvement of treatment, adverse effects, and additional medication. We performed a meta-analysis if possible. We assessed level of evidence using the GRADE approach. We used standard methodological procedures recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included 10 trials reported in 9 publications (N = 1651). Only one trial out of 10 was assessed at low risk of bias. Five trials used the currently recommended daily dose for the drug, and two trials used lower daily doses available over the counter. Three trials investigated NSAIDs no longer approved for human use. The follow-up duration was short in all studies but one. Three trials (n = 918) compared the effects of NSAIDs to those of placebo on pain reduction. The pooled mean difference showed comparable pain reduction (visual analogue scale, 0 to 100) in the NSAIDs and placebo groups (MD -4.56, 95% CI -11.11 to 1.99). Heterogeneity was high (I 2 = 82%), and the quality of the evidence was very low. When we excluded one trial with a short follow-up of eight hours, the mean difference further decreased (MD -0.09, 95% CI -9.89 to 9.71). Three trials (n = 753) compared NSAIDs to placebo regarding global improvement. We found low-quality evidence that NSAIDs are more effective than placebo with a risk ratio of 1.14 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.27). One trial (n = 214) studied the effect of NSAIDs on disability, finding very low-quality evidence that NSAIDs are no more effective than placebo on disability. Four trials (n = 967) comparing NSAIDs to placebo reported adverse effects, with low-quality evidence that the risk for adverse effects is higher in the NSAID group than in the placebo group (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.93). The adverse effects reported in this review are consistent with those previously reported in the literature.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated systematic review including 10 trials evaluating the efficacy of NSAIDs versus placebo or other drugs in people with sciatica reports low- to very low-level evidence using the GRADE criteria. The efficacy of NSAIDs for pain reduction was not significant. NSAIDs showed a better global improvement compared to placebo. These findings must be interpreted with caution, as the level of evidence according to the GRADE classification was very low for the outcome pain reduction and low for global improvement due to small study samples, inconsistent results, imprecision, and a high risk of bias in the included trials. While the trials included in the analysis were not powered to detect potential rare side effects, we found an increased risk for side effects in the short-term NSAIDs use. As NSAIDs are frequently prescribed, the risk-benefit ratio of prescribing the drug needs to be considered.

### How effective are physiotherapy interventions in treating people with sciatica? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^11218GHJ]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Physiotherapy interventions are prescribed as first-line treatment for people with sciatica; however, their effectiveness remains controversial. The purpose of this systematic review was to establish the short-, medium- and long-term effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions compared to control interventions for people with clinically diagnosed sciatica.

Methods

This systematic review was registered on PROSPERO CRD42018103900. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL (EBSCO), Embase, PEDro, PubMed, Scopus and grey literature were searched from inception to January 2021 without language restrictions. Inclusion criteria were randomised controlled trials evaluating physiotherapy interventions compared to a control intervention in people with clinical or imaging diagnosis of sciatica. Primary outcome measures were pain and disability. Study selection and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers with consensus reached by discussion or third-party arbitration if required. Risk of bias was assessed independently by two reviewers using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool with third-party consensus if required. Meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses were performed with random effects models using Revman v5.4. Subgroup analyses were undertaken to examine the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions compared to minimal (e.g. advice only) or substantial control interventions (e.g. surgery).

Results

Three thousand nine hundred and fifty eight records were identified, of which 18 trials were included, with a total number of 2699 participants. All trials had a high or unclear risk of bias. Meta-analysis of trials for the outcome of pain showed no difference in the short (SMD − 0.34 [95%CI − 1.05, 0.37] p = 0.34, I² = 98%), medium (SMD 0.15 [95%CI − 0.09, 0.38], p = 0.22, I² = 80%) or long term (SMD 0.09 [95%CI − 0.18, 0.36], p = 0.51, I² = 82%). For disability there was no difference in the short (SMD − 0.00 [95%CI − 0.36, 0.35], p = 0.98, I² = 92%, medium (SMD 0.25 [95%CI − 0.04, 0.55] p = 0.09, I² = 87%), or long term (SMD 0.26 [95%CI − 0.16, 0.68] p = 0.22, I² = 92%) between physiotherapy and control interventions. Subgroup analysis of studies comparing physiotherapy with minimal intervention favoured physiotherapy for pain at the long-term time points. Large confidence intervals and high heterogeneity indicate substantial uncertainly surrounding these estimates. Many trials evaluating physiotherapy intervention compared to substantial intervention did not use contemporary physiotherapy interventions.

Conclusion

Based on currently available, mostly high risk of bias and highly heterogeneous data, there is inadequate evidence to make clinical recommendations on the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions for people with clinically diagnosed sciatica. Future studies should aim to reduce clinical heterogeneity and to use contemporary physiotherapy interventions.

### Stratified care versus usual care for management of patients presenting with sciatica in primary care (SCOPiC): a randomised controlled trial [^113K7AG6]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Results

Between May 28, 2015, and July 18, 2017, 476 participants were randomly assigned from 42 general practices. Figure 2 shows the flow of participants through the trial. At the point of randomisation, in the stratified care arm, the algorithm for matching patients to one of the three care pathways was followed in all but four cases (four patients in group 1 had recovered by the time of their assessment in the SCOPiC research clinic and were not referred on for the two physiotherapy sessions defined in the protocol within the care pathway for group 1). At the point of randomisation, in the usual care arm, 200 patients were referred for further physiotherapy treatment, 28 were deemed not to need further active treatment and were discharged back to their GP, and ten were referred for a spinal specialist consultation.

### Surgery versus conservative care for persistent sciatica lasting 4 to 12 months [^111CPR4z]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

The treatment of chronic sciatica caused by herniation of a lumbar disk has not been well studied in comparison with acute disk herniation. Data are needed on whether diskectomy or a conservative approach is better for sciatica that has persisted for several months.

Methods

In a single-center trial, we randomly assigned patients with sciatica that had lasted for 4 to 12 months and lumbar disk herniation at the L4-L5 or L5-S1 level in a 1:1 ratio to undergo microdiskectomy or to receive 6 months of standardized nonoperative care followed by surgery if needed. Surgery was performed by spine surgeons who used conventional microdiskectomy techniques. The primary outcome was the intensity of leg pain on a visual analogue scale (ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more severe pain) at 6 months after enrollment. Secondary outcomes were the score on the Oswestry Disability Index, back and leg pain, and quality-of-life scores at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year.

Results

From 2010 through 2016, a total of 790 patients were screened; of those patients, 128 were enrolled, with 64 in each group. Among the patients assigned to undergo surgery, the median time from randomization to surgery was 3.1 weeks; of the 64 patients in the nonsurgical group, 22 (34%) crossed over to undergo surgery at a median of 11 months after enrollment. At baseline, the mean score for leg-pain intensity was 7.7 in the surgical group and 8.0 in the nonsurgical group. The primary outcome of the leg-pain intensity score at 6 months was 2.8 in the surgical group and 5.2 in the nonsurgical group (adjusted mean difference, 2.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 3.4; P < 0.001). Secondary outcomes including the score on the Owestry Disability Index and pain at 12 months were in the same direction as the primary outcome. Nine patients had adverse events associated with surgery, and one patient underwent repeat surgery for recurrent disk herniation.

Conclusions

In this single-center trial involving patients with sciatica lasting more than 4 months and caused by lumbar disk herniation, microdiskectomy was superior to nonsurgical care with respect to pain intensity at 6 months of follow-up.

### Cascade of decisions meet personal preferences in sciatica treatment decisions [^111fahzD]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Study Design

An in-depth interview study including patients, general practitioners, neurologists and neurosurgeons.

Objective

To gain insight in decision-making in sciatica care, by identifying patients' and physicians' preferences for treatment options, and the differences between and within both groups.

Summary Of Background Data

Sciatica is a self-limiting condition, which can be treated both conservatively and surgically. The value of both options has been disputed, and the care pathway is known for a substantial amount of practice variation. Most Dutch patients are taken care of by general practitioners before they are referred to hospital-based neurologists, who might refer to a neurosurgeon, who can perform a surgical intervention. Dutch sciatica care thus follows the principles of stepped care, and a cascade of decisions precedes surgery. Better understanding of the decision-making within this cascade might reveal opportunities to improve shared decision-making and to reduce unwarranted practice variation.

Methods

Interviews with 10 patients and 22 physicians were analysed thematically.

Results

While physicians were confident of their clinical diagnosis, patients preferred confirmation trough imaging to exclude other possible explanations. Furthermore, many patients showed reluctance towards the use of (strong) opioids, while all physicians favoured this and underlined the benefits of opioids in the management of sciatica complaints, to buy time and to allow patients to recover naturally. Finally, individual physicians differed strongly in their opinion on benefits and optimal timing of surgical treatment and epidural injections.

Conclusions

Dutch sciatica care is characterised by a cascade of decisions preceding surgery. Preferences differ within and between patients and physicians, which adds to the practice variation. To improve decision-making, physicians and patients should invest not necessarily more in the exchange of options or preferences, but in making sure the other understands the rationale behind them.

### Stratified care versus usual care for management of patients presenting with sciatica in primary care (SCOPiC): a randomised controlled trial [^112di2Ao]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Potential explanations for the results of the SCOPiC trial include the performance of the stratification algorithm in predicting referral to specialists, the natural and clinical course of sciatica symptoms in primary care, and the effectiveness of the usual care intervention. The algorithm's predictive performance in relation to referral to spinal specialists is acknowledged to be modest (C-statistic 0·70), with a sensitivity of 51%, specificity of 73%, and positive predictive value of 22%, and a number of patients fast-tracked to MRI and specialist assessment might not have needed this care pathway. Additionally, our qualitative interview data, which will be published elsewhere, highlighted that for patients with a short duration of symptoms, clinicians were reluctant to consider invasive treatments such as injections and surgery before conservative treatment options were tried first, and before sufficient time for natural improvement had passed. As mentioned previously, no factors have been consistently shown to be associated with outcome in sciatica, and thus would be useful to guide clinical decision making about early referral to spinal specialists. The stratified care model tested in this trial was designed to help with identification of patients who were likely to be referred to specialists at some point and instigating this referral early in the patient's presentation, in addition to matching the remainder of patients to conservative packages of care early on. However, the good improvement achieved by most patients in both arms, including those in sciatica group 3 who had the highest baseline levels of pain and disability (with approximately a fifth in both arms reporting recovery within 4 weeks from randomisation), is indicative of an overall favourable natural and clinical course despite the initial high pain and incapacity levels, and points to the fact that the current prognostic factors associated with outcome or with early referral to specialists are not adequately capturing the population most likely to benefit from such a treatment pathway.

### Stratified care versus usual care for management of patients presenting with sciatica in primary care (SCOPiC): a randomised controlled trial [^114bbydk]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

A model of stratified care for patients consulting with non-specific low back pain, which uses a stratification tool to identify their risk of disability related to persistent back pain in order to match patients to appropriate treatments, has previously been shown to be both clinically and cost-effective in the UK National Health Service (NHS). There is insufficient evidence as to whether a similar approach specifically for patients presenting with sciatica in primary care could be beneficial.

A key challenge in the development of predictive and stratified care models for patients with sciatica is the scarce and inconsistent evidence for prognostic factors independently associated with outcome. To date, it has not been possible to predict which patients might benefit from surgery. An alternative stratification method is to test whether predicting and instigating early referral to spinal specialists improves outcomes compared to clinical care based on clinical judgement alone. We developed an adapted stratified care algorithm specifically for patients with sciatica presenting in primary care. Briefly, the algorithm combines information about the risk (low, medium, or high) of persistent disability (using the STarT Back tool; appendix p 9) with clinical criteria (current leg pain, pain below knee, interference with work or home activities, and objective sensory deficits) associated with referral to spinal specialist services, to allocate patients into one of three groups that are each matched to a care pathway. Patients at low risk of poor outcome, irrespective of clinical characteristics, are allocated to group 1 and are offered up to two sessions with a physiotherapist for brief support with self-management; patients at medium risk of poor outcome who have all four clinical characteristics, and patients at high risk of poor outcome with any three of the clinical characteristics, are allocated to group 3 with a matched care pathway of fast-track to MRI and referral to a spinal specialist; the remainder of patients are allocated to group 2 and offered up to six sessions of physiotherapy. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of the algorithm for patient allocation to group 3 have been previously reported; sensitivity was 51%, specificity 73%, and the positive predictive value was 22% (C-statistic 0·70). Details of the matched care pathways for each sciatica group have been previously reported in our published protocol. The SCOPiC trial investigated whether this stratified care model led to faster resolution of sciatica symptoms compared with non-stratified usual care, and whether this approach was cost-effective. The linked qualitative interviews with patients and clinicians, exploring their views and experiences of the fast-track care pathway tested in the trial, will be reported separately.

### Lumbosacral radiculopathies: conservative approaches to management [^117BhHy9]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The prevalence of sciatica in Western society and its economic and functional impact make it an important problem to understand for treatment. Such understanding will impact greatly both medical management and decisions regarding activity, which could affect the perceived disability and financial dependence of a patient. This knowledge could be used to direct primary prevention, patient education, and future research efforts in back pain. The article also discusses that such strategies could improve health, decrease disability, and rein in costs.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115rtBDN]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Objective To investigate the efficacy and tolerability of analgesic and adjuvant pain drugs typically administered in primary care for the management of patients with sciatica.

Design Systematic review.

Data source International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL, and LILACS.

Study selection Randomised controlled trials assessing the efficacy and tolerability of drugs versus placebo or other treatment for sciatica.

Data extraction Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed methodological quality using the PEDro scale. Pain and disability outcomes were converted to a common 0 to 100 scale. Data were pooled with a random effects model, and the GRADE approach was used in summary conclusions.

Results Twenty three published reports met the inclusion criteria. The evidence to judge the efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, muscle relaxants, and opioid analgesics ranged from moderate to low quality. Most of the pooled estimates did not favour the active treatment over placebo. The pooled results of two trials of corticosteroids (mean difference in overall and leg pain −12.2, 95% confidence interval −20.9 to −3.4) and a single trial of the anticonvulsant gabapentin for chronic sciatica (mean difference in overall pain relief −26.6, −38.3 to −14.9) showed some benefits but only in the short term. The median rate of adverse events was 17% (interquartile range 10–30%) for the active drugs and 11% (3–23%) for placebo. Trial limitations included failure to use validated outcome measures, lack of long term follow-up, and small sample size.

Conclusions As the existing evidence from clinical trials is of low quality, the efficacy and tolerability of drugs commonly prescribed for the management of sciatica in primary care is unclear.

### The management of sciatica by acupuncture: an expert consensus using the improved Delphi survey [^1144ccza]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Pain is the most common symptom of sciatica. As an emotional experience, it was defined as unpleasant feelings and emotional experiences related to actual or potential damage, or described by such damage. A recommendation from the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) that six-core outcome domains for the design of chronic pain clinical trials should be considered, including emotional functioning. Patients with chronic pain are prone to mental disorders and aggravate the psychological burden. In our consensus content, we also reached a consensus on the mental state. In the future clinical research for acupuncture treatment of sciatica, we must also pay attention to mental functioning.

Unlike conventional medical treatment, whether acupuncture can be effective for sciatica may be related to "dose". Based on traditional Chinese acupuncture theory, the number of acupuncture points, the selection of acupoints, the frequency of treatment, and the time of needle retention are the key factors to achieve the best treatment effect. A randomized controlled pilot study of the dose-effect of acupuncture on sciatica found that the number of acupuncture points (ie, dose) may play a key role in pain relief. The "low-dose" manual acupuncture (MAL) treatment group, which involved six acupoints, was as effective as the "high-dose" manual acupuncture (MAH) treatment group, which involved 18 acupoints in treating sciatica. However, the possible dose-related response has not been fully explored in sciatica. Therefore, we formulate consensus items on the parameters required for the effect of acupuncture intervention and finally reach recommendations on certain items, including the frequency of acupuncture treatment, needle holding time, and treatment time.

### Invasive treatments for low back disorders [^113dV893]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

ACOEM Guidelines — scope and clinical questions for invasive treatments target management of low back disorders among working-age adults and span acute (up to 1 month duration), subacute (1 to 3 months' duration), and chronic (more than 3 months' duration) clinical timeframes; covered conditions include low back pain (LBP), sciatica/radiculopathy, spondylolisthesis, facet arthrosis, degeneration of the disc, failed back surgery syndrome, and spinal stenosis, while several broad categories including congenital disorders or malignancies and specific intraoperative procedures are not addressed. Guidance is organized by treatment phase (acute, subacute, chronic, postoperative) to answer multi-part questions including when, and for what conditions invasive procedures are recommended, when, and for what conditions surgery are recommended, which surgeries are recommended for which conditions, and what management options are recommended for delayed recovery.

### Stratified care versus usual care for management of patients presenting with sciatica in primary care (SCOPiC): a randomised controlled trial [^11268uGp]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Background

Sciatica has a substantial impact on individuals and society. Stratified care has been shown to lead to better outcomes among patients with non-specific low back pain, but it has not been tested for sciatica. We aimed to investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of stratified care versus non-stratified usual care for patients presenting with sciatica in primary care.

Methods

We did a two-parallel arm, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial across three centres in the UK (North Staffordshire, North Shropshire/Wales, and Cheshire). Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had a clinical diagnosis of sciatica, access to a mobile phone or landline number, were not pregnant, were not currently receiving treatment for the same problem, and had no previous spinal surgery. Patients were recruited from general practices and randomly assigned (1:1) by a remote web-based service to stratified care or usual care, stratified by centre and stratification group allocation. In the stratified care arm, a combination of prognostic and clinical criteria associated with referral to spinal specialist services were used to allocate patients to one of three groups for matched care pathways. Group 1 was offered brief advice and support in up to two physiotherapy sessions; group 2 was offered up to six physiotherapy sessions; and group 3 was fast-tracked to MRI and spinal specialist assessment within 4 weeks of randomisation. The primary outcome was self-reported time to first resolution of sciatica symptoms, defined as "completely recovered" or "much better" on a 6-point ordinal scale, collected via text messages or telephone calls. Analyses were by intention to treat. Health-care costs and cost-effectiveness were also assessed. This trial is registered on the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN75449581.

Findings

Between May 28, 2015, and July 18, 2017, 476 patients from 42 general practices around three UK centres were randomly assigned to stratified care or usual care (238 in each arm). For the primary outcome, the overall response rate was 89% (9467 of 10601 text messages sent; 4688 [88%] of 5310 in the stratified care arm and 4779 [90%] of 5291 in the usual care arm). Median time to symptom resolution was 10 weeks (95% CI 6·4–13·6) in the stratified care arm and 12 weeks (9·4–14·6) in the usual care arm, with the survival analysis showing no significant difference between the arms (hazard ratio 1·14 [95% CI 0·89–1·46]). Stratified care was not cost-effective compared to usual care.

Interpretation

The stratified care model for patients with sciatica consulting in primary care was not better than usual care for either clinical or health economic outcomes. These results do not support a transition to this stratified care model for patients with sciatica.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^113UAS6C]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

Very low to low certainty evidence suggests that discectomy was superior to non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections in reducing leg pain and disability in people with sciatica with a surgical indication, but the benefits over non-surgical care reduced over time. Discectomy might be an option for people who require rapid leg pain relief and disability improvement, when the benefits outweigh the risks and costs related to surgery.

ASIPP epidural guidelines — sciatica management reviews state that epidural steroid was recommended as a good intervention due to superiority in reducing ODI, with intravenous and subcutaneous anti-TNF-α identified as the optimal treatment for both acute and chronic sciatica; a systematic review and network meta-analysis by Lewis et al supported the effectiveness of epidural injections in the same line as disc surgery and nonopioid medication, and Lee et al concluded that epidural injection was strongly recommended with high degree of evidence and that the transforaminal approach was more strongly recommended than caudal approach.

### Early surgery for sciatica [^111dfzmK]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

International guidelines for sciatica recommend a stepped care approach starting with conservative management (ie, physiotherapy and medication), escalating to steroid injections, then surgery when non-surgical treatment has failed or when major radicular weakness is present. Unfortunately, evidence on the effectiveness of both non-surgicaland surgical options is uncertain.

In a linked paper, Liu and colleagues (doi:) report a methodologically sound and balanced systematic review and meta-analysis of 24 randomised clinical trials evaluating the evidence of surgical care for people with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation. Their meta-analysis suggests that discectomy is statistically significantly superior to non-surgical treatment in reducing leg pain and disability. However, effects were moderate at best (10–20 point reduction on a 100 point scale), but mostly small (5–10 point reduction). The benefits of discectomy were only evident in the short to medium term, with no clinically meaningful effects beyond 12 months.

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. outcomes from the neuPSIG working group [^114KBNkX]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

Pain radiating from the spine into the leg is commonly referred to as "sciatica". "Sciatica" may be associated with significant consequences for the person living with the condition, imposing a reduced quality of lifeand substantial direct and indirect costs (eg, £1.2–10.6 billion annually in the United Kingdom alone, extrapolated from primary care data).

Of note, there is no consensus on the definition and diagnostic criteria for "sciatica". The term "sciatica" has been used to encompass a range of nerve-related conditions originating from the spine such as radicular pain or painful radiculopathy. Despite the linguistic allusion to neural involvement, "sciatica" has in some instances even been used to encompass somatic referred pain.

Although these pain conditions may overlap, they are discrete entities with differing dominant pain characteristics (eg, nociceptive or neuropathic), which may require specific management approaches. Nevertheless, these terms are often used interchangeably, and these heterogeneous conditions are often amalgamated in clinical trials. Whether or not this amalgamation contributes to the modest treatment effects seen for "sciatica" is unclear.

Two of the main challenges associated with a diagnosis of "sciatica" relate to the inconsistent use of terminology for the diagnostic labels, "sciatica" or radicular pain or painful radiculopathy, and the identification of neuropathic pain. These challenges hinder collective clinical and scientific understanding and clarity regarding these conditions, impact effective clinical communication and care planning, prevent clear interpretation of the scientific literature related to the condition, and ultimately may contribute to the limited efficacy of care for people living with "sciatica". Indeed, most trials on conservative management for people with "sciatica" either show no, or at best, modest effects.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112HhBPd]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Data synthesis and analysis

We grouped the studies by surgical procedures. Then, within each surgical procedure, comparators were grouped as non-surgical (non-pharmacological or pharmacological) treatment, epidural steroid injections, and placebo or sham surgery (eg, intradiscal injection of saline solution). We presented discectomy as the primary surgical procedure because this procedure is most widely used for sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation.

Where appropriate, we converted continuous pain and disability outcomes to a common 0–100 scale (0 represents no pain or disability, 100 represents worst pain or disability) (supplemental files 3–5). We pooled data where possible, reported continuous outcomes as mean difference and 95% confidence intervals, and reported dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Statistical heterogeneity was determined with the I 2 test. A random effects model was used for all pooled comparisons.

Rather than selecting an arbitrary minimum clinically important threshold, we adopted a system of reporting consistent with the recommendations from the American College of Physicians' 2017 guidelines for low back pain. For pain and disability measured on a 0–100 point scale, an effect size of 5–10 points was considered small, 10–20 points moderate, and more than 20 points large. After reviewing the data, we considered effect size below 5 to be negligible.

Subgroup and exploratory meta-regression

We conducted preplanned subgroup analyses of our estimates of treatment effect (leg pain and disability) at each follow-up time to explore the influence of mean duration of symptom (< 3 months or > 3 months), approach of discectomy (micro or open). We also did post hoc subgroup analyses to explore the influence of analgesics in the comparator group (yes or no), small study effects (< 100 participants in each arm), and unsuccessful non-surgical treatment (yes or no).

We performed univariate meta-regression analyses of difference of means (leg pain and disability) on year of publication, duration of symptom, and sample size as continuous variables, in the comparison of discectomy versus non-surgical treatment across all time points.

Patient and public involvement

Due to the lack of funding, patients or the public were not involved in the design, conduct, or reporting of this study.

### Novel approach to characterising individuals with low back-related leg pain: cluster identification with latent class analysis and 12-month follow-up [^116jWeNF]. Pain (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical implications

This work gives detailed insight into the complexity of LBLP and shows that information on initial presentation can help classify patients into distinct clusters.

Even within a specific condition/presentation such as sciatica, variation is overlooked if only 'average' population measures are considered. Heterogeneous study populations in clinical research can potentially confound outcomes and recent clinical practice guidelines for LBP treatments conclude there is insufficient evidence to better match treatment for presentations of leg pain/sciatica. The clusters identified in this work may represent groups likely to need a different management approach.

Currently management of sciatica is a stepped care approach in those not deteriorating or with signs suggestive of sinister pathology, starting with non-invasive treatments and progressing to more invasive treatment options. Timing and when to move to the next step is not clear, particularly in those with higher pain levels and it still remains unknown which patient will benefit from what intervention at which point (e.g. conservative management/surgery /injection). Two of the clusters represent patients that could preferentially respond to this stepped approach (cluster 2 and 3). Cluster 4 patients may benefit from a more intensive initial approach earlier in their management e.g. specialist opinion regarding more invasive options (surgery/ injections). Patients in cluster 1 and cluster 5 may be more suitable for pain management options that include psychosocial interventions.

Levels of depression and anxiety were highest in the clusters with most severe symptoms, which is unsurprising and levels remained highest in cluster 5 at 12 months. Mechanisms driving the high pain and anxiety are potentially different between the two groups and management should reflect this. The atypical sciatica cluster resembles profiles of patients with persistent/ widespread pain, whereas cluster 4 have a clear diagnosis and in the clinical setting are more likely to be considered for treatment options such as injections and/or surgery.

These clusters could be more homogenous groups that represent uniquely different responders to specific interventions. The next step is to consider optimum management pathways for these clusters and formally test whether different management options improve outcomes.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113RTpwW]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy and tolerability of analgesic and adjuvant pain drugs typically administered in primary care for the management of patients with sciatica.

Design

Systematic review. Data source International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL, and LILACS.

Study Selection

Randomised controlled trials assessing the efficacy and tolerability of drugs versus placebo or other treatment for sciatica.

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed methodological quality using the PEDro scale. Pain and disability outcomes were converted to a common 0 to 100 scale. Data were pooled with a random effects model, and the GRADE approach was used in summary conclusions.

Results

Twenty three published reports met the inclusion criteria. The evidence to judge the efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, muscle relaxants, and opioid analgesics ranged from moderate to low quality. Most of the pooled estimates did not favour the active treatment over placebo. The pooled results of two trials of corticosteroids (mean difference in overall and leg pain -12.2, 95% confidence interval -20.9 to -3.4) and a single trial of the anticonvulsant gabapentin for chronic sciatica (mean difference in overall pain relief -26.6, -38.3 to -14.9) showed some benefits but only in the short term. The median rate of adverse events was 17% (interquartile range 10–30%) for the active drugs and 11% (3–23%) for placebo. Trial limitations included failure to use validated outcome measures, lack of long term follow-up, and small sample size.

Conclusions

As the existing evidence from clinical trials is of low quality, the efficacy and tolerability of drugs commonly prescribed for the management of sciatica in primary care is unclear.

### Outcome of invasive treatment modalities on back pain and sciatica: an evidence-based review [^114HNsk8]. European Spine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Within the framework of evidence-based medicine high-quality randomised trials and systematic reviews are considered a necessary prerequisite for progress in orthopaedics. This paper summarises the currently available evidence on surgical and other invasive procedures for low back pain. Results of systematic reviews conducted within the framework of the Cochrane Back Review Group were used. Data were gathered from the latest Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2005, Issue 2. The Cochrane reviews were updated using the evidence summary on surgery and other invasive procedures from the COST B13 European Guidelines for the Management of Acute and Chronic Non-Specific Low Back Pain. Facet joint, epidural, trigger point and sclerosant injections have not clearly been shown to be effective and can consequently not be recommended. There is no scientific evidence on the effectiveness of spinal stenosis surgery. Surgical discectomy may be considered for selected patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc prolapses that fail to resolve with the conservative management. Cognitive intervention Combined with exercises is recommended for chronic low back pain, and fusion surgery may be considered only in carefully selected patients after active rehabilitation programmes during 2 years time have failed. Demanding surgical fusion techniques are not better than the traditional posterolateral fusion without internal fixation.

### The management of sciatica by acupuncture: an expert consensus using the improved Delphi survey [^114Ask8U]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sciatica is usually unilateral radiation pain along the direction of the sciatic nerve, accounting for 13% to 40% in different studies and reviews. Lumbosacral nerve root (L4-S1) inflammation or compression is the main cause. Neuroradiology studies have confirmed that 85% of sciatica is related to disc disease. Most patients report low back pain at the same time as pain. The severity of pain varies from patient to patient along with a sudden or chronic onset mostly. It can extend from below the knee to the toes of the feet. In severe cases, symptoms such as low back pain, decreased muscle strength, and abnormal reflexes may occur, which would cause severe discomfort with limited quality of life and function.

The current focus of treatment is to prevent the disease from becoming chronic through conventional drug treatment and early conservative treatment. However, conventional drugs have a variety of potential adverse events, particularly gastrointestinal and cardiovascular effects. Recently updated clinical guidelines emphasize the role of conservative treatment of sciatica from Denmark, and the US. Surgery which can early relieve pain maybe is an option if the symptoms do not improve after 6–8 weeks of early intervention, but its effect is similar to that of conservative treatment within one year.

Acupuncture is a non-pharmacological therapy used in pain control. At present, acupuncture is widely used in the treatment of sciatica, but the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend that acupuncture should not be provided as a non-invasive treatment for patients with sciatica, which is based on the following: i) Relative values of different outcomes; ii) Trade-off between clinical benefits and harms; iii) Trade-off between net clinical effects and costs; iv) Quality of evidence; and v) Other considerations. In terms of the standardized use of acupuncture, there is no internationally recognized evidence and guidance recommendations except for the "Evidence-Based Acupuncture Clinical Practice Guide: Sciatica" from China. However, with the continuous emergence of new research evidence (ie, changes in available interventions, clinical efficacy, or cost), it is necessary to conduct expert consensus based on existing evidence and update appropriately to maintain the trustworthiness of clinical guidelines.

These uncertainties of acupuncture treatment recommendations for sciatica prompted this study to establish an expert consensus based on the clinical investigation and literature review by using the improved Delphi method, which is conducive to unifying the acupuncture principles and putting forward a standard therapeutic protocol for the treatment of sciatica which could be used in future trials and clinical practice.

### How effective are physiotherapy interventions in treating people with sciatica? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115wPE3n]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Apart from the possibility that physiotherapy is indeed not effective for patients with sciatica, there are multiple possible reasons for the lack of evidence. The physiotherapy interventions used in the 11 trials comparing physiotherapy with substantial interventions are not all considered contemporary in line with current clinical guidelines. This is a reflection of a lack of recent physiotherapy trials, with only four of the 11 studies published in the last decade. Current clinical guidelines recommend group exercise and continuation of normal activities; however, bedrest was a component of the conservative treatment arm in two trials. The UK NICE Guidelines find no evidence supporting the use of corsets or belts, but these were a core component in another trial conducted before publication of these guidelines. The physiotherapy interventions are highly heterogeneous and remain unclear in several studies. The Bailey study leaves physiotherapy interventions at the discretion of the treating clinician, and the Peul study refers people to physiotherapy only if they are fearful of movement, leaving uncertainty about how many participants in those trials had active physiotherapy treatment. It could also be argued that patients deemed suitable for surgery are likely to represent a specific subgroup that may be less amenable to physiotherapeutic interventions (e.g. with intractable pain or neurological deficit). Indeed, two trials comparing physiotherapy interventions with surgery included patients who had already failed conservative treatment, raising serious concerns that physiotherapy interventions could possibly succeed in such a population.

A further challenge to progress in treatment is the diagnosis of sciatica itself. There is no agreed definition for sciatica, reflected in the wide range of definitions used in clinical trials, including our review. The broad term 'sciatica' comprises radiculopathy, radicular pain, or somatic referred pain. The differing patient populations bring clinical heterogeneity to most meta-analyses. Unfortunately, the high heterogeneity among studies reduces the confidence in our results. Together with previous systematic reviews with inconclusive findings, our results question the value of continuing to perform clinical trials in heterogeneous groups of patients. Although subgrouping according to risk stratification showed promise in the management of people with non-specific low back pain, this has failed in patients with sciatica. Subgrouping using a mechanism-based approach shows promising signals in patients with neuropathic pain of different aetiologies, but has yet to be examined in sciatica.

### Effect of gabapentin vs pregabalin on pain intensity in adults with chronic sciatica: a randomized clinical trial [^112aoKSg]. JAMA Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Optimal pharmacologic treatment for chronic sciatica (CS) is currently unclear. While gabapentin (GBP) and pregabalin (PGB) are both used to treat CS, equipoise exists. Nevertheless, pharmaceutical regulation authorities typically subsidize one drug over the other. This hinders interchange wherever the favored drug is either ineffective or ill-tolerated.

Objective

To assess GBP vs PGB head to head for the treatment of CS.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A preplanned interim analysis of a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy crossover trial of PGB vs GBP for management of CS at half the estimated final sample size was performed in a single-center, tertiary referral public hospital. A total of20 patients underwent randomization from March 2016 to March 2018, and2 were excluded with 1 lost to follow-up and the other requiring urgent surgery unrelated to the study. Patients attending a specialist neurosurgery clinic with unilateral CS were considered for trial recruitment. Chronic sciatica was defined as pain lasting for at least 3 months radiating into 1 leg only to, at, or below the knee level. Imaging (magnetic resonance imaging with or without computed tomography) corroborating a root-level lesion concordant with symptoms and/or signs was determined by the trial clinician. Inclusion criteria included patients who had not used GBP and PGB and were 18 years or older. Analyses were intention to treat and began February 2018.

Interventions

Randomly assigned participants received GBP (400 mg to 800 mg 3 times a day) then PGB (150 mg to 300 mg twice daily) or vice versa, each taken for 8 weeks. Crossover followed a 1-week washout.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was pain intensity (10-point visual analog scale) at baseline and 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes included disability (using the Oswestry Disability Index) and severity/frequency of adverse events.

Results

The total trial population (N = 18) consisted mostly of men (11 [61%]) with a mean (SD) age of 57 (16.5) years. A third of the cohort were smokers (5 [28%]), and more than half consumed alcohol (12 [67%]). Gabapentin was superior to PGB, with fewer and less severe adverse events. Both GBP (mean [SD], 7.54[1.39] to 5.82[1.72]; P < .001) and PGB (mean [SD], 7.33[1.30] to 6.38[1.88]; p = 0.002) displayed significant visual analog pain intensity scale reduction and Oswestry Disability Index reduction (mean [SD], 59.22[16.88] to 48.54[15.52]; P < .001 for both). Head to head, GBP showed superior visual analog pain intensity scale reduction (mean [SD], GBP: 1.72[1.17] vs PGB: 0.94[1.09]; p = 0.035) irrespective of sequence order; however, Oswestry Disability Index reduction was unchanged. Adverse events for PGB were more frequent (PGB, 31 [81%] vs GBP, 7 [19%]; p = 0.002) especially when PGB was taken first.

Conclusions and Relevance

Pregabalin and GBP were both significantly efficacious. However, GBP was superior with fewer and less severe adverse events. Gabapentin should be commenced before PGB to permit optimal crossover of medicines.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^115SRk9b]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Assessment of risk of bias for the included studies

Two review authors (SR and MM) working independently of each other conducted the risk-of-bias assessment and data extraction. Risk of bias of the individual studies was assessed using the criteria list advised by the Cochrane Back Review Group (CBRG), which consists of 11 items that assess internal validity. Items and operationalisation are given in Table 2. Items were scored as positive if they fulfilled the criteria, negative when bias was likely or marked as inconclusive if there was insufficient information. Differences in the scoring of the risk-of-bias assessment and data extraction were discussed during a consensus meeting. The item for compliance was not scored because this item was irrelevant for single-session interventions, such as surgery. A study with a low risk of bias was defined as fulfilling six or more of the validity items.

Table 2
Items from the risk-of-bias tool and criteria for operationalisation

Data collection and analysis

Included studies were categorised under separate comparisons with clinically homogeneous characteristics. An a priori list of items was used for the data extraction, consisting of both descriptive data (e.g. study population, type of interventions) and quantitative data regarding the primary and secondary outcome measures. With sufficient clinically and statistically homogeneous and comparable reported outcomes, data was planned to be pooled with the aid of Revman 5. To identify publication bias, funnel plots were planned to be examined. In case meta-analysis was not feasible, a best evidence synthesis was anticipated using low-risk-of-bias studies. The overall quality of the evidence was graded as "High", "Moderate", "Low", or "Very low", according to the GRADE approach by Furlan et al. Single studies were considered imprecise (i.e. sparse data) and provide "low quality evidence", which could be further downgraded to "very low quality evidence" if there were also limitations in design or indirectness.

### Advice to stay active or structured exercise in the management of sciatica: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116mLF2P]. Spine (2015). Low credibility.

Study Design

A systematic review and meta-analysis.

Objective

To evaluate the evidence on comparative effectiveness of advice to stay active versus supervised structured exercise in the management of sciatica.

Summary Of Background Data

Conservative management of sciatica usually includes interventions to promote physical activity in the form of advice to stay active or exercise, but there has been no systematic review directly comparing the effectiveness of these 2 approaches.

Methods

Data Sources included MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PEDro databases. Studies were randomized controlled trials comparing advice with exercise. Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed methodological quality using the PEDro scale. Pain and disability data were extracted for all time points and converted to a common 0 to 100 scale. Data were pooled with a random effects model for short, intermediate, and long-term follow-ups. The GRADE approach was used to summarize the strength of evidence.

Results

Five trials were included in the meta-analysis, which showed a significant, although small effect favoring exercise over advice for reducing leg pain intensity in the short term (weighted mean difference: 11.43 [95% confidence interval, 0.71–22.16]) but no difference for disability (weighted mean difference: 1.45 [95% confidence interval, -2.86 to 5.76]). Furthermore, there was no difference at intermediate and long-term follow-ups between advice and exercise for patient-relevant outcomes.

Conclusion

There is low-quality evidence (GRADE) that exercise provides small, superior effects compared with advice to stay active on leg pain in the short term for patients experiencing sciatica. However, there is moderate-quality evidence showing no difference between advice to stay active and exercise on leg pain and disability status in people with sciatica in the long term.

### Epidural corticosteroid injections in the management of sciatica: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1128dqir]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Existing guidelines and systematic reviews provide inconsistent recommendations on epidural corticosteroid injections for sciatica. Key limitations of existing reviews are the inclusion of trials with active controls of unknown efficacy and failure to provide an estimate of the size of the treatment effect.

Purpose

To determine the efficacy of epidural corticosteroid injections for sciatica compared with placebo.

Data Sources

International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and CINAHL.

Study Selection

Randomized, placebo-controlled trials assessing the efficacy of epidural corticosteroid injections in participants with sciatica.

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Leg pain, back pain, and disability were converted to common scales from 0 (no pain or disability) to 100 (worst possible pain or disability). Thresholds for clinically important change in the range of 10 to 30 have been proposed for these outcomes. Effects were calculated for short-term (> 2 weeks but ≤ 3 months) and long-term (≥ 12 months) follow-up.

Data Synthesis

Data were pooled with a random-effects model, and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach was used in summary conclusions. Twenty-five published reports (23 trials) were included. The pooled results showed a significant, although small, effect of epidural corticosteroid injections compared with placebo for leg pain in the short term (mean difference, -6.2 [95% CI, -9.4 to -3.0]) and also for disability in the short term (mean difference, -3.1 [CI, -5.0 to -1.2]). The long-term pooled effects were smaller and not statistically significant. The overall quality of evidence according to the GRADE classification was rated as high.

Limitation

The review included only English-language trials and could not incorporate dichotomous outcome measures into the analysis.

Conclusion

The available evidence suggests that epidural corticosteroid injections offer only short-term relief of leg pain and disability for patients with sciatica. The small size of the treatment effects, however, raises questions about the clinical utility of this procedure in the target population.

Primary Funding Source

None.

### Low back and radicular pain: a pathway for care developed by the British pain society [^112dHsJD]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

These consensus guidelines aim to provide an overview of best practice for managing chronic spinal pain reflecting the heterogeneity of low back pain. Most guidelines have covered only one aspect of spinal care and thus have been divisive and potentially worsened the quality of care. Additionally, some of the evidence base is subjective and of poor quality. The British Pain Society low back pain pathway has reached across all disciplines and involved input from patients. It is recognized, however, that there is an urgent need for further good-quality clinical research in this area to underpin future guidelines. Considerable work is still needed to clarify the evidence; however, foundations have been laid with this pathway. Key features include: risk stratification; clarification of intensity of psychological interventions; a logical progression for the management of sciatica; and decision points for considering structural interventions such as spinal injections and surgery.

### Acupuncture therapy for sciatica: an overview of systematic reviews and meta-analysis [^115qUDi7]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sciatica is a neuropathic pain syndrome resulting from inflammatory injury or mechanical compression of the lumbosacral nerve roots (L4–S1). It typically presents as radiating pain from the buttocks down the leg along nerve distribution and may be accompanied by sensory disturbances and motor dysfunction. Although symptoms may resolve spontaneously in some cases, only 55% of individuals with sciatica experience meaningful clinical improvement within 1 year of onset. Approximately 34% of affected individuals develop chronic pain lasting beyond 2 years, which may lead to neurological deficits or motor impairments and severely reduce patients' quality of life. In addition, the financial burden of long-term treatment further complicates disease management.

Conservative therapies, such as functional exercises and spinal manipulation, remain the first-line approach for managing sciatica symptoms. However, the effectiveness of conservative treatment remains controversial, as several meta-analyses have reported no significant improvement in sciatica symptoms. Commonly prescribed analgesics — including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, and corticosteroids — are frequently associated with adverse events such as nausea, vomiting, and palpitations, which often compromise treatment adherence. Moreover, several studies have found that these medications offer limited benefits in reducing pain or disability. Given these limitations, there is a pressing need to identify safe, effective, and affordable adjunctive therapies.

Acupuncture, a core modality in traditional Chinese medicine, involves the insertion of fine needles into specific acupoints to elicit the "Deqi" sensation, to contribute to therapeutic effects. Its potential efficacy in sciatica has been preliminarily demonstrated in several clinical studies. A recent high-quality trial reported that, compared with sham acupuncture, acupuncture significantly improved treatment effectiveness, reduced pain intensity, increased pain threshold, and enhanced functional outcomes in patients with sciatica. Despite growing evidence supporting acupuncture, inconsistencies across studies highlight the need to comprehensively evaluate its reliability, limitations, and methodological shortcomings to inform future research. A prior evidence review conducted in 2015lacked methodological depth due to the limited use of evaluation tools. Since the emergence of new studies, an updated and more rigorous synthesis is warranted.

Therefore, this overview aims to evaluate the current body of evidence on acupuncture for sciatica from a multidimensional perspective, incorporating assessment of methodological quality, reporting standards, and study overlap. A secondary meta-analysis was conducted to synthesize efficacy outcomes. The goal is to identify limitations in existing research and provide clearer guidance for future studies and clinical decision-making.

### How effective are physiotherapy interventions in treating people with sciatica? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116avvRN]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, in patients with clinically diagnosed sciatica, physiotherapy interventions trialed to date provide inadequate evidence to make specific recommendations on their effectiveness in reducing pain or disability. The lack of convincing evidence may be due to several factors including incomplete trial reporting, clinical, methodological, and statistical heterogeneity, and trials lacking high methodological quality. Rather than continuing to perform trials in the heterogeneous population of 'sciatica', future studies should focus on reducing clinical heterogeneity, using contemporary physiotherapy interventions and high methodological quality to hopefully end the roadblock of discovery on the most effective physiotherapy interventions for these patient populations.
