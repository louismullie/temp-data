## Question

Labs to order for chronic headaches

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which laboratory tests should be ordered for patients presenting with chronic headaches. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational principle that most chronic headaches are primary and diagnosed clinically. Then, I should verify which "red flags" truly warrant laboratory testing. Next, I will categorize the secondary etiologies that justify targeted labs, including infection, inflammation/vasculitis, endocrine/metabolic, medication overuse, and structural/intracranial pressure disorders. After that, I need to check pediatric nuances and explicitly state what not to order. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and close with a concise summary that aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: for stable, typical chronic primary headaches with a normal neurologic examination, routine laboratory testing is not indicated, and diagnosis remains clinical using ICHD-3 criteria and a careful history and exam, with neuroimaging reserved for red flags or suspected secondary causes, not as a screening tool [^114u9R7g] [^111q1eKj] [^114Kgub8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify which clinical features actually trigger testing. Fever, systemic illness, weight loss, night sweats, new focal deficits, papilledema, thunderclap onset, cancer/immunosuppression, pregnancy/postpartum, age over 50 with new headache, and medication overuse are the principal red flags that shift evaluation toward targeted labs and imaging rather than routine screening [^114Kgub8] [^115f3rxm] [^116BXpqN].

> I will now examine infection-related scenarios. If fever, immunocompromise, or meningeal signs are present, I need to check CBC with differential, inflammatory markers (ESR/CRP), and consider blood cultures. If meningitis or encephalitis is suspected, lumbar puncture with CSF analysis is indicated, and in HIV or other high-risk hosts I should consider targeted infectious serologies such as toxoplasmosis or cryptococcus based on context, recognizing that CRP alone is not reliable to rule in or out intracranial infection in the ED setting [^111b8gJc] [^1178mtsR] [^113RZvEp].

> Wait, let me verify the vasculitis and inflammatory workup. In patients over 50 with new temporal headache, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, or visual symptoms, I should order ESR and CRP and arrange urgent temporal artery ultrasound or biopsy if labs are elevated or suspicion remains high, remembering that up to about 10% of biopsy-proven giant cell arteritis can have ESR less than 40 mm/hr, so normal inflammatory markers do not exclude disease when pretest probability is high [^114QVtSK].

> Next, I should review endocrine and metabolic contributors. Hypo- or hyperthyroidism can present with headache and fatigue; checking TSH with reflex free T4 is reasonable when symptoms suggest thyroid disease, and in women with amenorrhea and persistent headaches I should consider pituitary imaging per endocrine guidance, while celiac disease serology (tissue transglutaminase IgA with total IgA) is appropriate when there are gastrointestinal symptoms, iron deficiency, or growth issues suggesting an atypical presentation including headache [^notfound] [^111JFtYM] [^114ApTPQ].

> I need to ensure I address medication overuse, since it is common and treatable. A careful medication history documenting days per month of acute analgesics, triptans, opioids, barbiturates, or caffeine is essential; no specific lab diagnoses MOH, but identifying overuse guides detoxification and prevents mislabeling as refractory "migraine" when the driver is iatrogenic, with guideline support for structured withdrawal strategies and follow-up intervals to monitor relapse risk [^114bxHxW] [^1171JdoG] [^116vS4H9].

> Let me consider structural and intracranial pressure etiologies. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension presents with headache, transient visual obscurations, and papilledema; while labs may be normal, I should confirm with funduscopy and, if suspected, proceed with brain MRI/MRV and lumbar puncture with opening pressure rather than ordering routine screening labs that won't clarify the diagnosis [^11679AMa] [^111b8gJc].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child or adolescent? I should double-check pediatric guidance. Routine labs are not recommended for recurrent pediatric headache when the neurologic examination is normal; instead, evaluation is clinical, and neuroimaging or lumbar puncture is reserved for abnormal exams, "worst headache", seizures, or other red flags, with the literature showing uniformly low yield for routine laboratory testing in this setting [^111b8gJc] [^113iogz6] [^115wgm7o].

> Hold on, I should verify what not to order to avoid low-value care. EEG is not indicated for routine headache evaluation, immunoglobulin G food antibody testing for headache trigger avoidance is discouraged, and broad panels of "headache labs" without a targeted indication add cost without diagnostic yield. Similarly, copeptin and other investigational biomarkers are not ready for routine clinical use in headache triage outside research contexts [^117WHcGF] [^117UJXDW] [^116hxHcv] [^111zRzHv].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach. First, confirm a detailed history and neurologic examination and screen for red flags. If none are present and the phenotype fits a primary headache disorder, no labs are indicated and management proceeds accordingly. If red flags are present, tailor labs to the suspected secondary cause: infection workup with CBC, ESR/CRP, and CSF as indicated; vasculitis screening with ESR/CRP and temporal artery evaluation; endocrine testing with TSH and selective pituitary or celiac serology when clinically suggested; medication overuse assessment via history; and structural or intracranial pressure evaluation with neuroimaging and LP rather than routine labs. Throughout, avoid low-yield tests and escalate to imaging or specialty referral when the clinical picture warrants it [^114u9R7g] [^114Kgub8] [^111q1eKj].

> In summary, I should confirm that routine laboratory testing is not helpful for typical chronic primary headaches. Instead, order targeted labs only when the history, examination, or evolving features raise concern for a secondary process, and let clinical judgment — not habit — drive the test selection to keep care evidence-based and cost-conscious [^114u9R7g] [^111q1eKj] [^114Kgub8].

For chronic headaches, **routine labs are not indicated** unless red flags or atypical features are present [^114u9R7g]. Order **CBC, ESR/CRP, TSH, and metabolic panel** when systemic symptoms, age > 50, immunocompromise, or cancer are suspected [^notfound]. Add **serum calcium, PTH, and vitamin D** if hyperparathyroidism is suspected; **celiac serology** if gastrointestinal symptoms or malabsorption are present [^notfound]; and **HIV, RPR, or Lyme testing** only if clinically indicated. Avoid routine labs in stable, typical primary headaches; use clinical judgment and reserve testing for cases with red flags or diagnostic uncertainty [^116BXpqN] [^114N3xxx].

## Indications for laboratory testing in chronic headaches

Laboratory testing is **not routinely indicated** for chronic headaches; however, certain clinical scenarios warrant targeted testing:

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, weight loss, night sweats, or fatigue suggest underlying systemic disease [^notfound].
- **Age of onset**: New-onset headaches after age 50 years [^114Kgub8].
- **Change in headache pattern**: Increasing frequency, severity, or new features [^114Kgub8].
- **Immunocompromised state**: HIV infection, immunosuppressive therapy, or malignancy [^114Kgub8].
- **Neurologic deficits**: Focal findings or papilledema [^111hkAmc].
- **Medication overuse**: Suspected medication-overuse headache [^112BfB8o].

---

## Recommended laboratory tests

When indicated, the following laboratory tests are **recommended**:

| **Test** | **Indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Complete blood count (CBC) | - Systemic symptoms <br/> - Suspected infection or malignancy | Screens for anemia, infection, or hematologic disorders [^notfound] |
| Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) | - Suspected inflammation <br/> - Vasculitis <br/> - Temporal arteritis | Detects systemic inflammation or vasculitis [^113RjZPp] |
| Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) | - Suspected thyroid dysfunction <br/> - Clinical features of hypo/hyperthyroidism | Screens for thyroid disorders that can cause headaches [^notfound] |
| Basic metabolic panel (BMP) | - Suspected electrolyte imbalance <br/> - Renal or hepatic dysfunction | Evaluates metabolic disturbances [^notfound] |
| Serum calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and vitamin D | Suspected hyperparathyroidism or calcium disorders | Screens for hypercalcemia-related headaches [^notfound] |
| Celiac disease serology (tissue transglutaminase antibodies) | - Gastrointestinal symptoms <br/> - Malabsorption <br/> - Iron deficiency anemia | Screens for celiac disease, which can present with headaches [^114ApTPQ] |
| HIV serology, rapid plasma reagin (RPR), Lyme serology | - Clinical suspicion of infectious etiologies <br/> - Risk factors | Screens for infectious causes of headaches [^notfound] |

## Laboratory tests not routinely recommended

Routine laboratory testing is **not recommended** for patients with stable, typical chronic primary headaches (migraine, tension-type, cluster) without red flags or atypical features. Unnecessary testing can lead to false positives, patient anxiety, and increased healthcare costs without improving diagnostic accuracy or management [^115wgm7o].

---

## Role of laboratory tests in differentiating primary and secondary headaches

Laboratory tests play a **limited role** in differentiating primary from secondary headaches. Primary headaches are diagnosed clinically based on history and examination, whereas secondary headaches require targeted testing based on clinical suspicion. Laboratory tests are most useful when secondary causes are suspected, such as:

- **Inflammatory or autoimmune disorders**: ESR, CRP, ANA, rheumatoid factor [^114QVtSK].
- **Infectious diseases**: HIV serology, RPR, Lyme serology [^notfound].
- **Endocrine disorders**: TSH, free T4, cortisol levels [^112ShkJj].
- **Metabolic disturbances**: Basic metabolic panel, serum calcium, vitamin D [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize a **targeted approach** to laboratory testing in chronic headaches:

- **American Academy of Neurology (AAN)**: Routine laboratory testing is not recommended for patients with stable, typical chronic primary headaches.
- **American College of Radiology (ACR)**: Laboratory testing is not indicated for routine evaluation of chronic headaches without red flags or atypical features.
- **European Academy of Neurology (EAN)**: Laboratory testing should be reserved for cases with suspected secondary causes or atypical presentations.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Laboratory testing is **not routinely indicated** for chronic headaches. A **targeted approach** is recommended, guided by clinical suspicion, red flags, and atypical features. Routine testing in stable, typical primary headaches should be avoided to prevent unnecessary costs, false positives, and patient anxiety.

### ACR appropriateness criteria headache [^116b3PfK]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Most patients presenting with uncomplicated, nontraumatic, primary headache do not require imaging. When history, physical, or neurologic examination elicits "red flags" or critical features of the headache, then further investigation with imaging may be warranted to exclude a secondary cause. Imaging procedures may be diagnostically useful for patients with headaches that are: associated with trauma; new, worse, or abrupt onset; thunderclap; radiating to the neck; due to trigeminal autonomic cephalgia; persistent and positional; and temporal in older individuals. Pregnant patients, immunocompromised individuals, cancer patients, and patients with papilledema or systemic illnesses, including hypercoagulable disorders may benefit from imaging. Unlike most headaches, those associated with cough, exertion, or sexual activity usually require neuroimaging with MRI of the brain with and without contrast to exclude potentially underlying pathology before a primary headache syndrome is diagnosed. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 36-year-old man who sought evaluation for a persistent headache and numbness on the cheek. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges. As the clinical course progresses, the differential is refined until a diagnosis is made.

Medical decision making — problem complexity, data categories, and risk examples include the following. Problems may include 2 or more stable chronic illnesses (chronic low back pain, chronic neck pain, chronic chest wall pain), one undiagnosed new problem with uncertain prognosis (low back pain, neck pain, headache, abdominal pain), or one acute illness with systemic symptoms or one acute complicated injury (vertebral fracture, spinal cord injury). Data review and analysis includes meeting of at least one out of the 3 criteria comprising Category 1 tests, documents, or independent historian(s), Category 2 independent interpretation of tests, or Category 3 discussion of management or test interpretation with external physician. Risk language includes moderate risk of morbidity from additional diagnostic testing or treatment with examples such as prescription drug management, decision regarding minor surgery with identified patient or procedure risk factors, decision regarding elective major surgery without identified patient or procedure risk factors, and diagnosis or treatment significantly limited by social determinants of health; it also notes High (CPT 99205, 99215) as shown in Table 12.

Diagnosis and Imaging

TN is fundamentally a clinical diagnosis, and as such, neuroimaging and laboratory tests are not mandatory to make a diagnosis. Patients with a characteristic history and a normal neurologic examination other than pain may be treated without further workup. However, modern workup of patients with TN usually includes elective imaging for all patients to exclude secondary causes of TN, such as inflammatory or mass lesions. As computer tomography (CT) is limited in evaluating the brain parenchyma, skull base nerves, and CSF cisterns, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with high-resolution sequences at the skull base is usually the modality of choice. According to a report of the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies, routine head imaging identifies nonvascular, structural causes of TN in up to 15% of TN patients.

Chronic migraine — diagnostic notes state that characterization of frequently recurring headache generally requires a headache diary to record information on pain and associated symptoms day-by-day for at least one month; when criteria A-C are fulfilled by headache that is daily and unremitting from < 24 hours after its first onset, code as 4.10 New daily persistent headache, and when the manner of onset is not remembered or is otherwise uncertain, code as 1.3 Chronic migraine; the most common cause of symptoms suggestive of chronic migraine is medication overuse, and patients meeting criteria for 1.3 Chronic migraine and for 8.2 Medication-overuse headache should be coded for both, with around 50% of patients apparently with 1.3 Chronic migraine reverting to an episodic migraine type after drug withdrawal; because tension-type-like headache is within the diagnostic criteria for 1.3 Chronic migraine, the diagnosis excludes the diagnosis of 2.

### Pitfalls in the management of headache in the emergency department [^112mHou6]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Headache is the fifth most common primary complaint of patients presenting to an emergency department (ED) in the United States. The emergency physician (EP) plays a unique role in the management of these patients, one that differs from that of the primary care physician, the neurologist, and other specialists. Diagnostic nomenclature used in the ED is necessarily less specific, as care is more appropriately focused on the relief of symptoms and the identification of life-threatening causes. By seeking a limited number of specific critical features on history and physical examination, the EP can minimize the risk of overlooking one of these dangerous causes of headache. When certain features are present, empirical therapies and diagnostic testing should be initiated in the ED. The most frequently encountered pitfalls in the management of patients with headache in emergency medicine practice, and those with the greatest likelihood to adversely affect patient outcomes, are discussed.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^114u9R7g]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Step 2: Diagnosis of migraine

The medical history is the mainstay of migraine diagnosis; with the assistance of a range of published aids (see the section Diagnostic aids), a full history should enable systematic application of the criteria set out in the ICHD-3. Physical examination is most often confirmatory and further investigations (for example, neuroimaging, blood samples or lumbar puncture) are occasionally required to confirm or reject suspicions of secondary causes for headache.

Medical history

An adequate medical history must include at least the following: age at onset of headache; duration of headache episodes; frequency of headache episodes; pain characteristics (for example, location, quality, severity, aggravating factors and relieving factors); accompanying symptoms (for example, photophobia, phonophobia, nausea and vomiting); aura symptoms (if any); and history of acute and preventive medication use. All are essential for the application of the ICHD-3 criteria.

Diagnostic criteria

The ICHD-3 criteria(Box 1), which were developed by the International Headache Society, set out the clinical features that establish the diagnosis of migraine and its types and subtypes. These criteria prioritize specificity over sensitivity, so an additional set of criteria are given for a diagnosis of probable migraine, which is defined as "migraine-like attacks missing one of the features required to fulfil all criteria for a type or subtype of migraine". Probable migraine is a diagnosis pending confirmation during early follow-up.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department with acute headache [^1175yf8E]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

This clinical policy focuses on critical issues in the evaluation and management of patients with acute headache. A MEDLINE search was performed, abstracts were reviewed, and appropriate full-text articles were read; references from reviewed articles were searched for additional material. This policy focuses on 4 areas of current interest and/or controversy in acute headache management: (1) response to headache therapy as an indicator of underlying pathology, (2) clinical findings predictive of increased intracranial pressure, (3) indications for emergent neuroimaging in patients with a complaint of headache, and (4) indications to pursue emergent diagnostic studies in patients with thunderclap headache but with normal findings on a head computed tomography (CT) scan and negative findings on a lumbar puncture. Recommendations for patient management are provided for each of these 4 topics based on strength of evidence. Level A recommendations represent patient management principles that reflect a high degree of clinical certainty, Level B recommendations represent patient management principles that reflect moderate clinical certainty, and Level C recommendations represent other patient management strategies based on preliminary, inconclusive, or conflicting evidence, or based on panel consensus. This guideline is intended for physicians working in hospital-based emergency departments.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^116BXpqN]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Differential diagnoses

Differential diagnoses for migraine include other primary headache disorders (Table 1) and some secondary headache disorders (Table 2). Distinction from other primary headache disorders is a prerequisite for successful management, whereas distinction from secondary headache disorders is crucial because some of these disorders are serious and potentially life-threatening (for example, meningitis and subarachnoid haemorrhage) (Table 2).

Table 1
Characteristics of primary headache disorders

Table 2
Red flags associated with secondary headaches,

Tension-type headache (TTH) is the only other paroxysmal headache disorder that is prevalent in the general population. TTH lacks the symptoms that accompany migraine and usually involves bilateral, mild to moderate pain with a pressing or tightening quality that is not aggravated by routine physical activity, (Table 1).

Cluster headache is a much less prevalent primary headache disorder that affects ~0.1% of the general population. Its features are highly characteristic and include frequently recurrent but short-lasting attacks (15–180 min) of strictly unilateral headache of severe or very severe intensity. The head pain is accompanied by ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms, such as conjunctival injection, lacrimation and nasal congestion(Table 1).

Medication-overuse headache (MOH) is a secondary headache disorder that is an important differential diagnosis for chronic migraine(Box 1). This disorder commonly develops from overuse of acute medication to treat migraine attacks, so the two disorders are often conflated (see Step 8 for more on MOH).

Some other secondary headache disorders can present with features that suggest migraine, but specific red flags should create suspicion (Table 2). Red flags in the medical history include thunderclap headache, atypical aura and head trauma. Red flags in the physical examination include unexplained fever, impaired memory and focal neurological symptoms (Table 2). These red flags are indications for further investigation, such as neuroimaging, blood samples or lumbar puncture.

### Cervicogenic headache: an assessment of the evidence on clinical diagnosis, invasive tests, and treatment [^113YEpNQ]. The Lancet: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Cervicogenic headache is characterised by pain referred to the head from the cervical spine. Although the International Headache Society recognises this type of headache as a distinct disorder, some clinicians remain sceptical. Laboratory and clinical studies have shown that pain from upper cervical joints and muscles can be referred to the head. Clinical diagnostic criteria have not proved valid, but a cervical source of pain can be established by use of fluoroscopically guided, controlled, diagnostic nerve blocks. In this Review, we outline the basic science and clinical evidence for cervicogenic headache and indicate how opposing approaches to its definition and diagnosis affect the evidence for its clinical management. We provide recommendations that enable a pragmatic approach to the diagnosis and management of probable cervicogenic headache, as well as a rigorous approach to the diagnosis and management of definite cervical headache.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for tension-type headache, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ACR 2023 guidelines recommend to obtain imaging (CT or MRI) in the presence of ≥ 1 of the following red flags to identify patients with secondary causes of headache:

- increasing frequency or severity of headaches

- fever

- neurologic deficit

- history of cancer or an immunocompromised condition

- older age (> 50 years) of onset

- posttraumatic onset.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute headache [^111sDYdd]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Critical question 1 — risk stratification for emergent neuroimaging in adult ED acute headache provides that Level A recommendations are none specified and Level B recommendations are to use the Ottawa Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Rule (≥ 40 years, complaint of neck pain or stiffness, witnessed loss of consciousness, onset with exertion, thunderclap headache, and limited neck flexion on examination) as a decision rule that has high sensitivity to rule out SAH, but low specificity to rule in SAH for patients with a normal neurologic examination result and peak headache severity within 1 hour of onset; although neck pain and stiffness are strongly associated with SAH, do not use a single physical sign and/or symptom to rule out SAH. Level C recommendations are none specified. Potential benefits are that the use of decision rules may reduce incidence of missed SAH in the ED and may expedite care, avoid unnecessary imaging and workup, and reduce unnecessary radiation exposure; a potential harm is that because of its poor specificity, application of the decision rule to the incorrect headache patient population may increase unnecessary testing.

### Q fever in Southern California: a case series of 20 patients from a VA medical center [^115EGpKj]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

Definition of acute and chronic disease.

Our case definition was adapted from the CDC National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System, which categorizes cases of Q fever as acute or chronic and confirmed or probable based on the clinical criteria and supporting laboratory evidence. Table 1 defines our method of case classification.

Table 1
Case definitions of Q fever cases (adapted from CDC's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System)

Acute Q fever typically presents itself as transient flu-like symptoms including fever, myalgias, severe headache, gastrointestinal symptoms, cough, and chest pain; however, presentation may also be asymptomatic. – The clinical criteria of acute illness included acute fever and at least one of the following: rigors, severe retrobulbar headache, acute hepatitis, pneumonia, or elevated liver enzymes. Laboratory confirmation of acute Q fever cases included a 4-fold increase in sequential phase II IgG serologic titers. Laboratory-supportive evidence for acute Q fever included a single serologic phase II IgG titer of ≥ 1:128. Cases of probable acute Q fever were defined as a clinically compatible presentation associated with supportive laboratory evidence, and cases of confirmed acute Q fever included those that met the clinical criteria and were associated with laboratory-confirming serology.

Chronic Q fever can be very specific and typically presents as culture-negative endocarditis or vascular aneurysms; however, early chronic Q fever can present as asymptomatic infection or with nonspecific symptoms. Clinical evidence supportive of chronic Q fever was defined as an identifiable focus of persistent infection. Laboratory confirmation of chronic Q fever cases was a phase I IgG titer ≥ 1:800. Laboratory-supportive evidence for chronic Q fever cases was defined as a single phase I IgG titer ≥ 1:128 but < 1:800.

We defined progression of acute to chronic disease as a case initially classified as confirmed or probable acute Q fever with subsequent development of laboratory-confirming evidence consistent with chronic Q fever and an identifiable focus of infection.

Demographic information, laboratory data, diagnostic imaging, risk factors, and treatment regimens were obtained from a retrospective chart review.

In our study, we defined rural as per the U. S. Census Bureau, which states that areas designated as rural have population densities less than 1,000 people per square mile.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute headache [^111zRzHv]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Copeptin biomarker risk stratification in acute nontraumatic headache: In a Class III study, 391 patients were prospectively enrolled with copeptin measured on arrival; the primary endpoint was a serious headache with a neurologic etiology requiring immediate intervention, and secondary endpoints were mortality and hospitalization at 3 months. Copeptin was associated with serious headache with an odds ratio of 2.03 (95% CI 1.52 to 2.70) and an area under the curve of 0.70 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.76). Disease states identified included 8 patients (2%) with SAH, 7 (1.8%) with sinus vein thrombosis, 10 (2.6%) with intracranial hemorrhage, and 7 (1.8%) with viral meningitis; the study had a sensitivity of only 91% for identification of serious secondary headache using the study's lowest laboratory cutoff, and copeptin may be a promising biomarker though routine clinical use will require multicenter trial and validation.

### New headaches with normal inflammatory markers: an early atypical presentation of giant cell arteritis [^114QVtSK]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

This case provides a warning on how easily common presentations may be dismissed, and serious diagnoses delayed if a broad list of differentials including additional systemic involvement is not considered.

This case illustrates how unexplained persistent headaches should raise the index of suspicion of atypical causes such as vasculitis. A judgement on the likelihood of vasculitis can be made at the time of clinical review with focused questions. This patient visited three different health professionals before a correct diagnosis was reached. Piecing together different symptoms and a patient timeline could have led to an earlier diagnosis. Asking 'red flag' questions is paramount in ensuring serious conditions are not missed. This is particularly important in systemic diseases, as patients are not necessarily aware of which symptoms are relevant. Thus, they may not volunteer the relevant clinical information unless prompted. This last point enabled the ophthalmologist to consider giant cell arteritis (GCA) as a diagnosis.

We demonstrate that although investigation results may be characteristic, they cannot always be relied on to exclude systemic diseases. In this case, inflammatory markers were not significantly raised, an unusual but well-documented occurrence. This is supported by a study that identified 167 patients fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology criteria for GCA over a 48-year period. Of these patients, nine had a reported erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of less than 40 mm/hour. Six of the nine patients had an ESR of < 30 mm/hour. All nine of these patients had a positive temporal artery biopsy. History taking and clinical judgement should therefore always take precedence in forming a diagnosis, and diagnoses not to be ruled out on the basis of normal tests; an important message in today's investigation-driven medical practice.

In the case of GCA, important screening questions to consider should include: scalp tenderness, temporal headaches, jaw claudication, visual disturbances, polymyalgia and constitutional symptoms.

### Medication-overuse headache: a review [^114bxHxW]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Classification of headache disorders and MOH

Headache is a subjective symptom, and no laboratory tests or other objective tests are available to diagnose headache. Classification and diagnostic criteria are therefore of essential importance both in clinical practice and research settings. Until 1960, headache diagnoses and studies were based on nonuniform descriptions of symptomatology. Diagnostic criteria for headache were first presented in 1962 when an ad hoc committee of the National Institutes of Health published a first set of criteria. In 1988, the International Headache Society (IHS) published a classification system that became the standard for headache diagnosis: Classification and diagnostic criteria for headache disorders, cranial neuralgias and facial pain. In the 1988 edition, the diagnosis "headache induced by chronic substance use or exposure" was taken into the classification. In 2004, a second edition "The International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-II)" was published, and the term "medication-overuse headache" was introduced. To be more applicable to patients in clinical practice, the diagnostic criteria for MOH were revised twice for the ICHD-II.–Before the last revision, MOH should paradoxically be entitled as "probable MOH" until overuse was discontinued, and then, if the patient improved after detoxification, given a definite MOH diagnosis. This meant that the patient could not receive a definite diagnosis of MOH until after a successful withdrawal of medication, following which she/he would no longer have MOH.

In 2013, a new version, "The International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd beta edition (ICHD-IIIb)", was published, taking these changes to MOH into account.

According to the ICHD-IIIb, "MOH is headache occurring on 15 or more days per month developing as a consequence of regular overuse of acute or symptomatic headache medication (on 10 or more, or 15 or more days per month, depending on the medication) for more than 3 months. It usually, but not invariably, resolves after the overuse is stopped" (Figure 1). With the present criteria, MOH can be diagnosed immediately, and independently of withdrawal.

MOH is classified as a secondary chronic headache, but whether MOH is a primary or secondary headache is still under debate, and the concept of medication-overuse in other secondary headaches is unclear. Further, the concept of chronic migraine with medication-overuse is probably one of the most disputed aspects of the classification.

### High risk clinical characteristics for subarachnoid haemorrhage in patients with acute headache: prospective cohort study [^111ZC1E8]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Research implications

The three proposed rules are being prospectively and explicitly evaluated in an ongoing study to determine their accuracy for subarachnoid haemorrhage, their interobserver agreement for interpretation, and their potential impact on investigation. Once this prospective evaluation has been completed, the optimal rule can be chosen for implementation into clinical practice. The best performing rule will allow clinicians to be more selective in determining which patients require investigation. This will improve care of patients by directing testing for those at high risk who might otherwise not be adequately investigated. At the same time, the rule should result in no computed tomography or lumbar puncture for patients at low risk, thus decreasing their morbidity from unnecessary tests.

### Headache and neuroimaging: why we continue to Do It [^1134cYxF]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The appropriate imaging of patients with headache presents a number of important and vexing challenges for clinicians. Despite a number of guidelines and studies demonstrating a lack of cost-effectiveness, clinicians continue to image patients with chronic nonfocal headaches, and the trend toward imaging is increasing. The reasons are complex and include the fear of missing a clinically significant lesion and litigation, habitual and standard of care practices, lack of tort reform, regulatory penalties and potential impact on one's professional reputation, patient pressures, and financial motivation. Regulatory and legislative reforms are needed to encourage best practices without fear of professional sanctions when following the guidelines. The value of negative findings on imaging tests requires better understanding because they appear to provide some measure of societal value. Clinical decision support tools and machine intelligence may offer additional guidance and improve quality and cost-efficient management of this challenging patient population.

### Headache diagnosis in children and adolescents [^116ZAXRa]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Pediatric headache is a common medical complaint managed across multiple subspecialties with a myriad of unique factors (clinical presentation and disease phenotype) that make accurate diagnosis particularly elusive. A thorough understanding of the stepwise approach to headache disorders in children is essential to ensure appropriate evaluation, timely diagnosis, and efficacious treatment. This work aims to review key components of a comprehensive headache assessment as well as discuss primary and secondary headache disorders observed in children, with a particular focus on clinical pearls and "red flag" symptoms necessitating ancillary diagnostic testing.

### The role of the otolaryngologist in the evaluation and management of headache [^114nYyhu]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Headaches are a global health problem and are encountered by a variety of specialties, including otolaryngologists. These patients can present as a challenge, but an understanding of primary and secondary headache disorders and the accompanying broad differential diagnosis is critical. For secondary headache disorders, a differential diagnosis categorized by anatomic location can help organize the evaluation of these patients, which can then be narrowed by the history and examination findings. Additional ancillary tests such as laboratories and imaging can further aid in diagnosis but are not always necessary.

### Neurophysiological tests and neuroimaging procedures in non-acute headache (2nd edition) [^114CRSSt]. European Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

A large number of instrumental investigations are used in patients with non-acute headache in both research and clinical fields. Although the literature has shown that most of these tools contributed greatly to increasing understanding of the pathogenesis of primary headache, they are of little or no value in the clinical setting.

Methods

This paper provides an update of the 2004 EFNS guidelines and recommendations for the use of neurophysiological tools and neuroimaging procedures in non-acute headache (first edition). Even though the period since the publication of the first edition has seen an increase in the number of published papers dealing with this topic, the updated guidelines contain only minimal changes in the levels of evidence and grades of recommendation.

Results

(i) Interictal EEG is not routinely indicated in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with headache. Interictal EEG is, however, indicated if the clinical history suggests a possible diagnosis of epilepsy (differential diagnosis). Ictal EEG could be useful in certain patients suffering from hemiplegic or basilar migraine. (ii) Recording evoked potentials is not recommended for the diagnosis of headache disorders. (iii) There is no evidence warranting recommendation of reflex responses or autonomic tests for the routine clinical examination of patients with headache. (iv) Manual palpation of pericranial muscles, with standardized palpation pressure, can be recommended for subdividing patient groups but not for diagnosis. Pain threshold measurements and EMG are not recommended as clinical diagnostic tests. (v) In adult and pediatric patients with migraine, with no recent change in attack pattern, no history of seizures, and no other focal neurological symptoms or signs, the routine use of neuroimaging is not warranted. In patients with trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia, neuroimaging should be carefully considered and may necessitate additional scanning of intracranial/cervical vasculature and/or the sellar/orbital/(para)nasal region. In patients with atypical headache patterns, a history of seizures and/or focal neurological symptoms or signs, MRI may be indicated. (vi) If attacks can be fully accounted for by the standard headache classification (IHS), a PET or SPECT scan will normally be of no further diagnostic value. Nuclear medical examinations of the cerebral circulation and metabolism can be carried out in subgroups of patients with headache for the diagnosis and evaluation of complications, when patients experience unusually severe attacks or when the quality or severity of attacks has changed. (vii) Transcranial Doppler examination is not helpful in headache diagnosis.

Conclusion

Although many of the examinations described in the present guidelines are of little or no value in the clinical setting, most of the tools, including thermal pain thresholds and transcranial magnetic stimulation, have considerable potential for differential diagnostic evaluation as well as for the further exploration of headache pathophysiology and the effects of pharmacological treatment.

### Does this patient with headache have a migraine or need neuroimaging? [^114N3xxx]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

In assessing the patient with headache, clinicians are often faced with 2 important questions: Is this headache a migraine? Does this patient require neuroimaging? The diagnosis of migraine can direct therapy, and information obtained from the history and physical examination is used by physicians to determine which patients require neuroimaging.

Objective

To determine the usefulness of the history and physical examination that distinguish patients with migraine from those with other headache types and that identify those patients who should undergo neuroimaging.

Data Sources and Study Selection

A systematic review was performed using articles from MEDLINE (1966-November 2005) that assessed the performance characteristics of screening questions in diagnosing migraine (with the International Headache Society diagnostic criteria as a gold standard) and addressed the accuracy of the clinical examination in predicting the presence of underlying intracranial pathology (with computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging as the reference standard).

Data Extraction

Two authors independently reviewed each study to determine eligibility, abstract data, and classify methodological quality using predetermined criteria. Disagreement was resolved by consensus with a third author.

Data Synthesis

Four studies of screening questions for migraine (n = 1745 patients) and 11 neuroimaging studies (n = 3725 patients) met inclusion criteria. All 4 of the migraine studies illustrated high sensitivity and specificity if 3 or 4 criteria were met. The best predictors can be summarized by the mnemonic POUNDing (Pulsating, duration of 4–72 hOurs, Unilateral, Nausea, Disabling). If 4 of the 5 criteria are met, the likelihood ratio (LR) for definite or possible migraine is 24 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5–388); if 3 are met, the LR is 3.5 (95% CI, 1.3–9.2), and if 2 or fewer are met, the LR is 0.41 (95% CI, 0.32–0.52). For the neuroimaging question, several clinical features were found on pooled analysis to predict the presence of a serious intracranial abnormality: cluster-type headache (LR, 10.7; 95% CI, 2.2–52); abnormal findings on neurologic examination (LR, 5.3; 95% CI, 2.4–12); undefined headache (ie, not cluster-, migraine-, or tension-type) (LR, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.0–7.1); headache with aura (LR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.6–6.6); headache aggravated by exertion or a valsalva-like maneuver (LR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4–3.8); and headache with vomiting (LR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2–2.6). No clinical features were useful in ruling out significant pathologic conditions.

Conclusions

The presence of 4 simple historical features can accurately diagnose migraine. Several individual clinical features were found to be associated with a significant intracranial abnormality, and patients with these features should undergo neuroimaging.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® headache: 2022 update [^1133kuEW]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Headache is an ancient problem plaguing a large proportion of the population. At present, headache disorders rank third among the global causes of disability, accounting for over $78 billion per year in direct and indirect costs in the United States. Given the prevalence of headache and the wide range of possible etiologies, the goal of this document is to help clarify the most appropriate initial imaging guidelines for headache for eight clinical scenarios/variants, which range from acute onset, life-threatening etiologies to chronic benign scenarios. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Survey of the initial management of celiac disease antibody tests by ordering physicians [^114ApTPQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy triggered by ingested gluten in genetically susceptible individuals, and affects approximately 1% of the population. Timely and accurate diagnosis of celiac disease is limited because physicians do not recognize atypical presentations, including chronic abdominal pain or chronic constipation. In addition approximately 60% of children present with extra-intestinal manifestations of celiac disease including fatigue, headaches, growth failure, arthralgias, and iron deficiency anemia. Many physicians are not aware of these atypical presentations of celiac disease that result in delays in diagnosis. Two-thirds of patients consult at least two physicians prior to the diagnosis. Delayed diagnosis and persistent intestinal inflammation lead to complications that include persistent gastrointestinal symptoms, pubertal delay, osteoporosis, autoimmune disorders, and increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. An economic evaluation demonstrated that in the year pre-diagnosis, persistent health concerns were investigated at an estimated cost of $8500 US per capita. Delayed diagnosis taxes both the individual and the health care system.

Celiac disease antibody screening with the tissue transglutaminase (TTG) antibody test identifies individuals who require further testing to diagnose celiac disease or alterations in management of those with known celiac disease. Management decisions following a positive celiac screen are influenced by the degree of elevation of the TTG and severity of patient symptoms. In addition, the TTG may be falsely positive in individuals with minimal or no symptoms such as first-degree relatives of patients with celiac disease or individuals who have medical conditions associated with celiac disease. Unfortunately other autoimmune diseases and intercurrent infections can cause false positive TTG results and must be considered when managing patients with minimal symptoms. Thus, many factors influence how celiac serology should be interpreted. "Choosing Wisely" is an initiative to help clinicians to appropriately manage abnormal test results and reduce unnecessary testing. Physicians must understand when a test should be ordered and how to interpret the result. By identifying general errors in management, physicians can improve patient care and reduce health care costs.

### Chronic daily headache: nosology and pathophysiology [^115YgudR]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Systematic scientific classification of primary headaches is inexact, relying on clinical features because the disorders lack diagnostic markers, although the International Headache Society classification has been successful in providing relatively homogenous clinical groups for pathophysiological and therapeutic studies. One area in which there have been particular difficulties and uncertainty is in classifying patients with frequent headache, particularly chronic daily headache. Clinical research on the topic is limited, and imprecise because of uncertainties of definition. Rigorous basic or applied clinical research is a rarity, attested to by a paucity of new publications in the past year. Accordingly, the scientific basis of chronic daily headaches remains to be determined. There is agreement on one issue: for headache specialists and neurologists this is an important clinical problem. We take the position that chronic daily headache is what it says — frequent headache. As hematologists make a diagnosis of anemia, which invites further investigation and sub-classification, neurologists might diagnose chronic daily headache not to imply that all its causes are the same but simply to begin the clinical process.

### Headache neuroimaging: routine testing when guidelines recommend against them [^113K7ztm]. Cephalalgia (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

The aim of this article is to determine the patient-level factors associated with headache neuroimaging in outpatient practice.

Methods

Using data from the 2007–2010 National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys (NAMCS), we estimated headache neuroimaging utilization (cross-sectional). Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore associations between patient-level factors and neuroimaging utilization. A Markov model with Monte Carlo simulation was used to estimate neuroimaging utilization over time at the individual patient level.

Results

Migraine diagnoses (OR = 0.6, 95% CI 0.4–0.9) and chronic headaches (routine, chronic OR = 0.3, 95% CI 0.2–0.6; flare-up, chronic OR = 0.5, 95% CI 0.3–0.96) were associated with lower utilization, but even in these populations neuroimaging was ordered frequently. Red flags for intracranial pathology did not increase use of neuroimaging studies (OR = 1.4, 95% CI 0.95–2.2). Neurologist visits (OR = 1.7, 95% CI 0.99–2.9) and first visits to a practice (OR = 3.2, 95% CI 1.4–7.4) were associated with increased imaging. A patient with new migraine headaches has a 39% (95% CI 24–54%) chance of receiving a neuroimaging study after five years and a patient with a flare-up of chronic headaches has a 51% (32–68%) chance.

Conclusions

Neuroimaging is routinely ordered in outpatient headache patients including populations where guidelines specifically recommend against their use (migraines, chronic headaches, no red flags).

### Laboratory tests of headache disorders-dawn of a new era? [^117SEMMg]. Cephalalgia (2016). Low credibility.

Context The classification of headache disorders has improved over the years, but further work is needed to develop and improve headache diagnosis within headache subtypes. The present review is a call for action to implement laboratory tests in the classification and management of primary and some secondary headaches. Background In this narrative review we present and discuss published tests that might be useful in phenotyping and/or diagnosis of long-lasting headache disorders such as migraine, tension-type headache, trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, trigeminal neuralgia and persisting secondary headaches. Aim The palpometer test, quantitative sensory testing, nociceptive blink reflex and autonomic tests may be valuable to phenotype and/or diagnose subforms of migraine, tension-type headache, cluster headache, trigeminal neuralgia and medication-overuse headache. Provocation tests with glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) may be valuable in subclassification of migraine and cluster headache. Lumbar pressure monitoring and optical coherence tomography may valuable tools to diagnose and follow patients with chronic headache and raised intracranial pressure. Finding A number of laboratory tests in headache research are presently available, but have primarily been performed in single research studies or a few studies that differ in methods and patient groups. At present, there is no evidence-based strategy for implementing diagnostic tests, but this could be achieved if well-reputed tertiary headache centers commence developing and implementing laboratory tests in order to improve the classification and treatment of headache patients.

### Early trends among seven recommendations from the Choosing Wisely Campaign [^1128QuBZ]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

The Choosing Wisely campaign consists of more than 70 lists produced by specialty societies of medical practices or procedures of minimal clinical benefit to patients in most situations, with recommendations regarding judicious use.

Objective

To quantify the frequency and trends of some of the earliest Choosing Wisely recommendations using nationwide commercial health plan population-level data.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective analysis of claims data for members of Anthem-affiliated commercial health plans. The low-value services selected were (1) imaging tests for uncomplicated headache; (2) cardiac imaging without history of cardiac conditions; (3) low back pain imaging without red-flag conditions; (4) preoperative chest x-rays with unremarkable history and physical examination results; (5) human papillomavirus testing for women younger than 30 years; (6) use of antibiotics for acute sinusitis; and (7) use of prescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for members with hypertension, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The number of members with medical and/or pharmacy claims for the included low-value services was assessed quarterly over a 2- to 3-year span through 2013. Trend changes in recommendations were evaluated across all quarters using Poisson regression with denominators as offsets.

Results

Two services had declines: Use of imaging for headache decreased from 14.9% to 13.4% (trend estimate, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.98–0.99]; P < .001), and cardiac imaging decreased from 10.8% to 9.7% (trend estimate, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.99–0.99]; P < .001). Two services had increases: Use of NSAIDs in select conditions increased from 14.4% to 16.2% (trend estimate, 1.02 [95% CI, 1.01–1.02]; P < .001), and human papillomavirus testing in younger women increased from 4.8% to 6.0% (trend estimate, 1.01 [95% CI, 1.00–1.01]; P < .001). Use of antibiotics for sinusitis remained stable (0.8% decrease from 84.5% to 83.7%; trend estimate, 1.00 [95% CI, 1.00–1.00]; p = 0.16). Use of preoperative chest x-rays (0.2% decrease, ending utilization 91.5%; trend estimate, 1.00 [95% CI, 1.00–1.00]; p = 0.70) and imaging for low back pain (53.7% utilization throughout study; p = 0.71) remained high with no statistically significant changes.

Conclusions and Relevance

For this population-level analysis of 7 low-value services analyzed, changes were modest but showed a desirable decrease for 2 recommendations (imaging for headache, cardiac imaging for low-risk patients). The effect sizes were marginal, however, and although 4 of the 7 lists had statistically significant changes-unsurprising given the large sample size-the clinical significance is uncertain. These results suggest that additional interventions are necessary for wider implementation of Choosing Wisely recommendations.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® headache [^111hkAmc]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Headache is one of the most common human afflictions. In most cases, headaches are benign and idiopathic, and resolve spontaneously or with minor therapeutic measures. Imaging is not required for many types of headaches. However, patients presenting with headaches in the setting of "red flags" such as head trauma, cancer, immunocompromised state, pregnancy, patients 50 years or older, related to activity or position, or with a corresponding neurological deficit, may benefit from CT, MRI, or noninvasive vascular imaging to identify a treatable cause. This publication addresses the initial imaging strategies for headaches associated with the following features: severe and sudden onset, optic disc edema, "red flags", migraine or tension-type, trigeminal autonomic origin, and chronic headaches with and without new or progressive features. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^116A1wCN]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Need for neuroimaging

The only role for neuroimaging in the diagnosis of headache is to confirm or exclude causes of secondary headache that are suspected on the basis of red flags in the medical history and/or physical examination. Otherwise, neuroimaging is not only rarely necessary in the diagnostic work-up of migraine but can be harmful, as it can involve exposure to ionizing radiation. When needed for investigation of possible secondary headache disorders, MRI is preferred to CT, as it offers a higher resolution and does not involve exposure to ionizing radiation. However, MRI can reveal clinically insignificant abnormalities (for example, white matter lesions, arachnoid cysts and meningiomas), which can alarm the patient and lead to further unnecessary testing.

Recommendations

Take a careful medical history, applying the ICHD-3 criteria.
Use validated diagnostic aids and screening tools, such as headache diaries, the three-item ID-Migraine questionnaire and the five-item Migraine Screen Questionnaire.
Consider differential diagnoses, including other primary headache disorders and secondary headache disorders.
Use neuroimaging only when a secondary headache disorder is suspected.

### Choosing wisely: a neurosurgical perspective on neuroimaging for headaches [^115MwQd3]. Neurosurgery (2015). Low credibility.

Multiple national initiatives seek to curb spending to address increasing healthcare costs in the United States. The Choosing Wisely initiative is a popular initiative that focuses on reducing healthcare spending by setting guidelines to limit tests and procedures requested by patients and ordered by physicians. To reduce spending on neuroimaging, the Choosing Wisely initiative and other organizations have offered guidelines to limit neuroimaging for headaches. Although the intentions are laudable, these guidelines are inconsistent with the neurosurgeon's experience with patients with brain tumor. If adopted by governing or funding organizations, these guidelines threaten to negatively affect the care and outcomes of patients with brain tumors, who frequently present with minimal symptoms or isolated headaches syndromes. As physicians grapple with the difficult conflict between evidence-based cost-cutting guidelines and individualized patient-tailored medicine, they must carefully balance the costs and benefits of discretionary services such as neuroimaging for headaches. By participating in the development of validated clinical decision rules on neuroimaging for headaches, neurosurgeons can advocate for their patients and improve their patients' outcomes.

### Fibromyalgia syndrome: under-, over-and misdiagnosis [^112SN4wD]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia syndrome (FM) is an enigma. During the past three decades, with the gradual acceptance of the validity of FM, it is variously under-, over and misdiagnosed. Evidence-based interdisciplinary guidelines have suggested a comprehensive clinical assessment to avoid this diagnostic conundrum. Every patient with chronic pain should be screened for chronic widespread pain (pain in four of five body regions) (CWP). Those with CWP should be screened for presence of additional major symptoms of FM: unrefreshed sleep and fatigue. A complete medical (including drug) history and complete physical examination is mandatory in the evaluation of a patient with CWP in order to consolidate the diagnosis of FM or identify features that may point to some other condition that may have a presentation similar to FM. Limited simple laboratory testing is recommended to screen for possible other diseases. The 2016 criteria may be used to further confirm the clinical diagnosis of FM. In consideration of the differential diagnosis of FM, attention should be paid to the presence of other chronic overlapping pain conditions and of mental disorders. FM as a stand alone diagnosis is however rare, as most patients with FM meet criteria for other chronic overlapping pain conditions or mental disorders. The severity of FM should be assessed in order to direct treatment approaches and help inform the likely outcome for an individual patient.

### Practice parameter: evaluation of children and adolescents with recurrent headaches: report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the practice committee of the Child Neurology Society [^111b8gJc]. Neurology (2002). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of pediatric recurrent headache — examination and indications for ancillary testing: Evaluation begins with thorough history, vital signs, and complete neurologic examination including the optic fundus, and the principle indication for performance of ancillary diagnostic testing rests on information or concerns revealed during this fundamental process. There is a lack of consensus concerning the role of diagnostic testing including routine laboratory testing, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, electroencephalography (EEG), and neuroimaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For acute severe presentations when serious conditions are suspected, if subarachnoid hemorrhage, acute or chronic meningitis, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, or certain other conditions are suspected, lumbar puncture when opening pressure measurement and appropriate ancillary testing are indicated, and if the clinical examination demonstrates nuchal rigidity with or without alteration of consciousness, signs of increased intracranial pressure, mental status changes, or lateralizing features, neuroimaging followed by lumbar puncture may need to be performed. The presence of headache accompanied by fever or in the immunocompromised patient must raise concerns for infections such as meningitis, either bacterial or viral.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) grade definitions — Grade A states: The USPSTF recommends the service with high certainty that the net benefit is substantial and the practice suggestion is to offer or provide this service. Grade B states: The USPSTF recommends the service with high certainty that the net benefit is moderate or moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial and the practice suggestion is to offer or provide this service. Grade C states: The USPSTF recommends selectively offering or providing this service to individual patients based on professional judgment and patient preferences with at least moderate certainty that the net benefit is small and the practice suggestion is to offer or provide this service for selected patients depending on individual circumstances. Grade D states: The USPSTF recommends against the service with moderate or high certainty that the service has no net benefit or that the harms outweigh the benefits and the practice suggestion is to discourage the use of this service. An I Statement concludes that current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms, and the practice suggestion is to read the clinical considerations and ensure patients understand the uncertainty if the service is offered.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on postdural puncture headache: a consensus report from a multisociety international working group [^114iSCRQ]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2024). High credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) levels of certainty regarding net benefit — High certainty indicates the available evidence usually includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative primary care populations, and these studies assess the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes. Moderate certainty indicates the available evidence is sufficient to determine effects on health outcomes but confidence is constrained by factors such as study size/quality or inconsistency, and as more information becomes available the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change and may be large enough to alter the conclusion. Low certainty indicates the available evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes due to limitations such as few or small studies, methodological flaws, inconsistency, gaps in the chain of evidence, limited generalizability, or lack of important outcomes; more information may allow estimation of effects. The USPSTF defines certainty as the likelihood that the assessment of the net benefit of a preventive service is correct.

Conclusion

The simplicity and accuracy of ID-CM will enable health care professionals with or without training in neurology, pain, or headache to correctly identify the majority of patients with migraine or CM. Clinicians will then be able to accurately diagnose or refer affected patients to specialists for effective treatment that will reduce the burden of illness experienced by those with migraine and CM.

### CGRP and migraine [^1151Huv2]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Interictal increase in CGRP levels in peripheral blood as a biological marker for chronic migraine

In this study, the authors investigated the possible use of CGRP as a marker for chronic migraine. 103 female patients diagnosed with chronic migraine according to international headache society criteria were recruited. Cases reported an average of 9.5 ± 3.4 years of chronic migraine and attempted detoxification at least once for a minimum of 2 months if diagnosed with analgesic overuse migraine. The control groups consisted of 31 healthy women with no headaches and on no medications, 43 females with episodic migraine, and 14 patients with cluster headaches (13 female, 1 male).

Morning blood samples were taken from all patients on days without moderate/severe headaches. No symptomatic medications were allowed in the previous 24 h and prophylactic medications were continued. CGRP was found to be significantly higher in chronic migraine as compared to all control groups interictally. The authors subsequently analyzed the potential of CGRP as a biomarker for chronic migraine and concluded that for a CGRP concentration of 43.45 ng/ml, 90.38% of CM, and 80.64% of controls would be correctly classified. They also propose that it is possible to distinguish between chronic migraine and episodic migraine on the CGRP level alone.

Comment. Although these findings demonstrate considerable potential for CGRP levels as a disease biomarker, considerably more evidence is required before it could be used in clinical practice. Sensitivity and specificity remains poor, and its value in the clinical setting remains unclear particularly as the IHS guidelines appear to provide clear guidance for the clinician. Furthermore, the choice of control groups is limited and it would be of interest to extend these groups to include cases more representative of general clinical practice. However, the study underlines the relevance of CGRP in pathophysiology and holds promise as an objective measure of response and of treatment stratification for future therapeutic trials and also those trials specifically targeting this molecule.

### Practice parameter: evaluation of children and adolescents with recurrent headaches: report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the practice committee of the Child Neurology Society [^115wgm7o]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the Practice Committee of the Child Neurology Society develop practice parameters as strategies for patient management based on analysis of evidence. For this parameter, the authors reviewed available evidence on the evaluation of the child with recurrent headaches and made recommendations based on this evidence.

Methods

Relevant literature was reviewed, abstracted, and classified. Recommendations were based on a four-tiered scheme of evidence classification.

Results

There is inadequate documentation in the literature to support any recommendation as to the appropriateness of routine laboratory studies or performance of lumbar puncture. EEG is not recommended in the routine evaluation, as it is unlikely to define or determine an etiology or distinguish migraine from other types of headaches. In those children undergoing evaluation for recurrent headache found to have a paroxysmal EEG, the risk for future seizures is negligible; therefore, further investigation for epilepsy or treatments aimed at preventing future seizures is not indicated. Obtaining a neuroimaging study on a routine basis is not indicated in children with recurrent headaches and a normal neurologic examination. Neuroimaging should be considered in children with an abnormal neurologic examination or other physical findings that suggest CNS disease. Variables that predicted the presence of a space-occupying lesion included 1) headache of less than 1-month duration; 2) absence of family history of migraine; 3) abnormal neurologic findings on examination; 4) gait abnormalities; and 5) occurrence of seizures.

Conclusions

Recurrent headaches occur commonly in children and are diagnosed on a clinical basis rather than by any testing. The routine use of any diagnostic studies is not indicated when the clinical history has no associated risk factors and the child's examination is normal.

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1178mtsR]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy in HIV with Toxoplasma gondii — baseline maternal T. gondii serologic status (IgG) should be obtained in HIV-infected women who become pregnant because of concerns regarding congenital toxoplasmosis, and case reports have documented transmission with reactivation of chronic infection in HIV-infected women with severe immunosuppression. Primary T. gondii infection can typically be distinguished from chronic infection using multiple serologic assays (IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE), IgG avidity, and differential agglutination tests. Because serologic testing is often difficult to interpret, pregnant HIV-infected women with suspected primary infection should be managed in consultation with a maternal-fetal medicine specialist who can access specialized laboratory testing (BIII). Toxoplasmosis diagnostic considerations are the same in pregnant women as in non-pregnant women, and while maternal infection is usually asymptomatic, after a 5–23 day incubation period non-specific symptoms such as fever, fatigue, headache, and myalgia may develop.

### The diagnostic accuracy of headache measurement instruments: a systematic review and meta-analysis focusing on headaches associated with musculoskeletal symptoms [^1129txyn]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

Results of individual studies

The aim of the index tests differed between the included seven articles, where four were 'replacement' tests (,–), one a 'triage' test and two aims were unclear. Three articles established the diagnostic accuracy for several migraine and TTH ICHD diagnoses aside from the "standard" diagnoses, including chronic migraine, chronic TTH, probable migraine, and probable TTH. For migraine, the sensitivity ranged from 0.49 to 1.00 and the specificity ranged from 0.85 to 0.96. For chronic migraine, the sensitivity and specificity were 0.71 and 0.98 respectively. Probable migraine had a sensitivity of 0.89 and a specificity of 0.54. The sensitivity for TTH ranged from 0.36 to 1.00 and the specificity range was 0.69 to 0.98. One study did not establish the specificity results from their test. Chronic TTH was tested in two studies, for which the sensitivity was 0.64 to 0.70 and the specificity 0.96 to 1.00. The test for probable TTH had a sensitivity of 0.92 and a specificity of 0.48.

For migraine, chronic migraine, and probable migraine five studies had a sensitivity above 0.70, which was also found for TTH, chronic TTH, and probable TTH in five studies (see Table 1) (,–). All six studies that reported specificity, had a specificity of 0.70 or higher for migraine, chronic migraine, and probable migraine and for TTH chronic TTH, and probable TTH.

### The American Academy of Neurology's top five choosing wisely recommendations [^117UJXDW]. Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Headache evaluation — EEG (electroencephalography) has considerably lower sensitivity than neuroimaging with CT or MRI for structural causes of headache, and performing EEGs in patients with headache increases cost without adding benefit; a normal EEG in a patient with headache with features suggesting the presence of a structural abnormality may provide a false sense of security and delay performance of neuroimaging, and incidental EEG abnormalities in a primary headache disorder may prompt additional unnecessary procedures or treatments.

### Clinical reasoning: progressive headache and diplopia in an 89-year-old man [^113RjZPp]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

An 89-year-old man presented with a 3-year history of chronic daily headaches that significantly worsened over the past 4 months. Initially episodic, the left-sided headaches became continuous and were accompanied by systemic symptoms such as weight loss and elevated inflammatory markers, specifically C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Over subsequent weeks, the neurologic examination revealed new-onset left-sided ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and marked visual acuity loss. This article explores the differential diagnosis for such a complex clinical presentation and highlights how a systematic diagnostic approach can guide clinicians toward the correct diagnosis.

### Analysis of appropriateness of outpatient CT and MRI referred from primary care clinics at an academic medical center: how critical is the need for improved decision support? [^113JmVaj]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze a large group of CT and MRI examinations for appropriateness using evidence-based guidelines.

Methods

The authors reviewed medical records from 459 elective outpatient CT and MR examinations from primary care physicians. Evidence-based appropriateness criteria from a radiology benefit management company were used to determine if the examination would have met criteria for approval. Submitted clinical history at the time of interpretation and clinic notes and laboratory results preceding the date of the imaging study were examined to simulate a real-time consultation with the referring provider. The radiology reports and subsequent clinic visits were analyzed for outcomes.

Results

Of the 459 examinations reviewed, 284 (62%) were CT and 175 (38%) were MRI. Three hundred forty-one (74%) were considered appropriate, and 118 (26%) were not considered appropriate. Examples of inappropriate examinations included brain CT for chronic headache, lumbar spine MR for acute back pain, knee or shoulder MRI in patients with osteoarthritis, and CT for hematuria during a urinary tract infection. Fifty-eight percent of the appropriate studies had positive results and affected subsequent management, whereas only thirteen percent of inappropriate studies had positive results and affected management.

Conclusion

A high percentage of examinations not meeting appropriateness criteria and subsequently yielding negative results suggests a need for tools to help primary care physicians improve the quality of their imaging decision requests. In the current environment, which stresses cost containment and comparative effectiveness, traditional radiology benefit management tools are being challenged by clinical decision support, with an emphasis on provider education coupled with electronic order entry systems.

### Headache management for the pain specialist [^115KZVvt]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Headache is a common symptom caused by a wide variety of diseases. Primary headaches include migraine, cluster headache, tension-type headache, and other less common diseases. It is important to differentiate these headaches from secondary headaches caused by vascular, neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, or toxic disorders. Most primary headaches have a genetic basis, with environmental factors acting as triggers. Recent advances in basic research resulted in the development of more specific and effective therapies. Medication-overuse headache is a very common cause of chronic daily headache. Detoxification from the offending drug is essential for headache improvement. Cervicogenic headache is common and needs to be diagnosed correctly since it may require specific therapy. Nerve blocks are useful for some patients with primary, as well as secondary, headaches.

### The case definition of chronic fatigue syndrome [^116zoCtk]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

The 1994 case definition of chronic fatigue syndrome is widely used not only for diagnosis but also for clinical and laboratory-based observations of this clinical entity. The criteria for the 1994 case definition are based primarily on symptoms and not on physical signs or chemical or immunological tests. This situation has resulted in conflicting clinical and laboratory observations that in all likelihood is due to different populations of patients being studied in different centers. Based on some of the recent publications, there appears to be an emerging picture of this disease entity that we propose could be used to subgroup chronic fatigue syndrome into four different subclasses. These subclasses would consist of chronic fatigue with primarily nervous system disorders such as impaired memory or concentration and headache, chronic fatigue with primarily endocrine system disorders such as unrefreshing sleep and postexertional malaise, chronic fatigue with musculoskeletal system disorders such as muscle pain and joint pain, and chronic fatigue with immune system/infectious disorders such as sore throat and tender lymph nodes. It is suggested that if clinical and laboratory-based studies on chronic fatigue syndrome were conducted on more homogeneous subgroups of patients, the data from one center to the other might not be as conflicting and more insights can be shed on the nature of this clinical condition.

### Evaluation of acute headaches in adults [^112JQnUA]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Classifying headaches as primary (migraine, tension-type or cluster) or secondary can facilitate evaluation and management A detailed headache history helps to distinguish among the primary headache disorders. "Red flags" for secondary disorders include sudden onset of headache, onset of headache after 50 years of age, increased frequency or severity of headache, new onset of headache with an underlying medical condition, headache with concomitant systemic illness, focal neurologic signs or symptoms, papilledema and headache subsequent to head trauma. A thorough neurologic examination should be performed, with abnormal findings warranting neuroimaging to rule out intracranial pathology. The preferred imaging modality to rule out hemorrhage is noncontrast computed tomographic (CT) scanning followed by lumbar puncture if the CT scan is normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more expensive than CT scanning and less widely available; however, MRI reveals more detail and is necessary for imaging the posterior fossa. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis can help to confirm or rule out hemorrhage, infection, tumor and disorders related to CSF hypertension or hypotension. Referral is appropriate for patients with headaches that are difficult to diagnose, or that worsen or fail to respond to management

### Frequent headaches: evaluation and management [^113bvVmU]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Most frequent headaches are typically migraine or tension-type headaches and are often exacerbated by medication overuse. Repeated headaches can induce central sensitization and transformation to chronic headaches that are intractable, are difficult to treat, and cause significant morbidity and costs. A complete history is essential to identify the most likely headache type, indications of serious secondary headaches, and significant comorbidities. A headache diary can document headache frequency, symptoms, initiating and exacerbating conditions, and treatment response over time. Neurologic assessment and physical examination focused on the head and neck are indicated in all patients. Although rare, serious underlying conditions must be excluded by the patient history, screening tools such as SNNOOP10, neurologic and physical examinations, and targeted imaging and other assessments. Medication overuse headache should be suspected in patients with frequent headaches. Medication history should include nonprescription analgesics and substances, including opiates, that may be obtained from others. Patients who overuse opiates, barbiturates, or benzodiazepines require slow tapering and possibly inpatient treatment to prevent acute withdrawal. Patients who overuse other agents can usually withdraw more quickly. Evidence is mixed on the role of medications such as topiramate for patients with medication overuse headache. For the underlying headache, an individualized evidence-based management plan incorporating pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies is necessary. Patients with frequent migraine, tension-type, and cluster headaches should be offered prophylactic therapy. A complete management plan includes addressing risk factors, headache triggers, and common comorbid conditions such as depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and chronic musculoskeletal pain syndromes that can impair treatment effectiveness. Regular scheduled follow-up is important to monitor progress.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^114KzJdX]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Migraine is a disabling primary headache disorder that directly affects more than one billion people worldwide. Despite its widespread prevalence, migraine remains under-diagnosed and under-treated. To support clinical decision-making, we convened a European panel of experts to develop a ten-step approach to the diagnosis and management of migraine. Each step was established by expert consensus and supported by a review of current literature, and the Consensus Statement is endorsed by the European Headache Federation and the European Academy of Neurology. In this Consensus Statement, we introduce typical clinical features, diagnostic criteria and differential diagnoses of migraine. We then emphasize the value of patient centricity and patient education to ensure treatment adherence and satisfaction with care provision. Further, we outline best practices for acute and preventive treatment of migraine in various patient populations, including adults, children and adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and older people. In addition, we provide recommendations for evaluating treatment response and managing treatment failure. Lastly, we discuss the management of complications and comorbidities as well as the importance of planning long-term follow-up.

### Chronic fatigue syndrome: evaluation and treatment [^114ecU68]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Severe fatigue is a common complaint among patients. Often, the fatigue is transient or can be attributed to a definable organic illness. Some patients present with persistent and disabling fatigue, but show no abnormalities on physical examination or screening laboratory tests. In these cases, the diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) should be considered. CFS is characterized by debilitating fatigue with associated myalgias, tender lymph nodes, arthralgias, chills, feverish feelings, and postexertional malaise. Diagnosis of CFS is primarily by exclusion with no definitive laboratory test or physical findings. Medical research continues to examine the many possible etiologic agents for CFS (infectious, immunologic, neurologic, and psychiatric), but the answer remains elusive. It is known that CFS is a heterogeneous disorder possibly involving an interaction of biologic systems. Similarities with fibromyalgia exist and concomitant illnesses include irritable bowel syndrome, depression, and headaches. Therefore, treatment of CFS may be variable and should be tailored to each patient. Therapy should include exercise, diet, good sleep hygiene, antidepressants, and other medications, depending on the patient's presentation.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^113hLrS6]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

1.2.2. Placebo control

Recommendations:

1.2.2.1. Interventions under evaluation for the acute treatment of migraine should be compared with placebo.

1.2.2.2. When two presumably active treatments are compared, a placebo control should be included for assay sensitivity.

Comments:

The placebo effect is a genuine psychobiological phenomenon that affects the results of clinical trials across different disease states. In trials for the acute treatment of migraine placebo response varies widely, from 6% to 56% for headache relief and from 6% to 25% for pain freedom. This variability makes it difficult to interpret the results of active comparator trials that do not include placebo. Trials using historical controls or active comparators lack assay sensitivity and require large sample sizes to provide the narrow confidence intervals (CIs) needed to ensure that new drugs are not inferior to controls.

In the past, modified designs (e.g. exclusion of placebo responders or sequential parallel designs) to reduce placebo response have proved poorly effective. Nonetheless, particular care should be dedicated to identify and mitigate placebo response risks as much as possible.

### Approach to acute headache in adults [^113zxBQ9]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Approximately one-half of the adult population worldwide is affected by a headache disorder. The International Headache Society classification and diagnostic criteria can help physicians differentiate primary headaches (e.g., tension, migraine, cluster) from secondary headaches (e.g., those caused by infection or vascular disease). A thorough history and physical examination, and an understanding of the typical features of primary headaches, can reduce the need for neuroimaging, lumbar puncture, or other studies. Some red flag signs and symptoms identified in the history or during a physical examination can indicate serious underlying pathology and will require neuroimaging or other testing to evaluate the cause of headache. Red flag signs and symptoms include focal neurologic signs, papilledema, neck stiffness, an immunocompromised state, sudden onset of the worst headache in the patient's life, personality changes, headache after trauma, and headache that is worse with exercise. If an intracranial hemorrhage is suspected, head computed tomography without contrast media is recommended. For most other dangerous causes of headache, magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography is acceptable.

### Systemic vasculitis and headache [^114m3sj2]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Clues to the diagnosis of vasculitis in suspected patients presenting with headache will be found in the history and examination and later confirmed by a comprehensive laboratory assessment employing systemic laboratory markers, neuroradiological imaging, and histopathologic tissue biopsy carefully chosen for the greatest yield and tailored to the presenting systemic illness whenever present. Effective management of affected patients requires the commitment of a multidisciplinary team of health professionals and caregivers. Attention should be directed early in the evaluative process to optimally control headaches while limiting the ischemic-enhancing effects of the underlying etiopathogenesis.

### Chronic migraine [^114EG324]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Chronic migraine is a disabling neurologic condition that affects 2% of the general population. Patients with chronic migraine have headaches on at least 15 days a month, with at least eight days a month on which their headaches and associated symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for migraine. Chronic migraine places an enormous burden on patients owing to frequent headaches; hypersensitivity to visual, auditory, and olfactory stimuli; nausea; and vomiting. It also affects society through direct and indirect medical costs. Chronic migraine typically develops after a slow increase in headache frequency over months to years. Several factors are associated with an increased risk of transforming to chronic migraine. The diagnosis requires a carefully performed patient interview and neurologic examination, sometimes combined with additional diagnostic tests, to differentiate chronic migraine from secondary headache disorders and other primary chronic headaches of long duration. Treatment takes a multifaceted approach that may include risk factor modification, avoidance of migraine triggers, drug and non-drug based prophylaxis, and abortive migraine treatment, the frequency of which is limited to avoid drug overuse. This article provides an overview of current knowledge regarding chronic migraine, including epidemiology, risk factors for its development, pathophysiology, diagnosis, management, and guidelines. The future of chronic migraine treatment and research is also discussed.

### Neuroimaging and diagnostic workup for headache [^115bXxgW]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Neuroimaging can play a vital role in headache evaluation, though its utilization must be judicious and evidence-based. While a comprehensive clinical assessment is always fundamental, imaging is essential for the diagnosis of many headache disorders. There exist several guidelines for headache imaging, but overutilization of imaging and missed diagnoses due to inappropriate imaging selection remain a significant challenge. This article examines the role of neuroimaging in primary and secondary headache disorders, discusses the strengths and limitations of different imaging modalities, and provides a practical framework for optimizing imaging utilization while maintaining resource efficiency.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^1172mi2J]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for diagnostic work-up of patients with CU present detailed history, selective laboratory evaluation, and conditional additional testing. History and physical examination items include Onset (eg, timing of symptoms with any change in medication or other exposures), Frequency, duration, severity, and localization of wheals and itching, Known precipitating factors of urticaria (eg, physical stimuli, exertion, stress, food, or medications), Associated angioedema or systemic manifestations (eg, headache, joint pain, or gastrointestinal symptoms), Known allergies, intolerances, infections, systemic illnesses, or other possible causes, Family history of urticaria and atopy, Degree of impairment of quality of life, Response to prior treatment, and Physical examination. For laboratory evaluation, Testing should be selective. A majority of members of the Practice Parameters Task Force expressed a consensus for the following routine tests in managing a patient with CU without atypical features: CBC with differential; Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, or both; Liver enzymes; TSH. The utility of performing the above tests routinely for patients with CU has not been established. Additional evaluation might be warranted based on patients' circumstances and might include but not be limited to the diagnostic tests listed below. A thorough history and meticulous physical examination are essential for determining whether these additional tests are appropriate: Skin biopsy; Physical challenge tests; Complement system (eg, C3, C4, and CH50); Stool analysis for ova and parasites; Urinalysis; Hepatitis B and C serologies; Chest radiography, other imaging studies, or both; Anti-nuclear antibody; Rheumatoid factor, anti-citrullinated protein; Cryoglobulin levels; Serologic and/or skin testing for immediate hypersensitivity; Thyroid autoantibodies; Serum protein electrophoresis. More detailed laboratory tests, skin biopsies, or both merit consideration if urticaria is not responding to therapy as anticipated, and Additional laboratory testing might be required before initiation of certain medications, such as G6PD screening before prescribing dapsone.

### Red flags and comfort signs for ominous secondary headaches [^115nNb4x]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Secondary headaches are classified by the cause of the underlying disease process that is causing the headache. There are hundreds of secondary headache diagnoses and this article is not an exhaustive discussion of secondary headache disorders. Maintaining a high level of virulence and having a structured approach to evaluating all patients with headache is the key to timely diagnosis of secondary headache disorders. Diagnostic testing is indicated based on the suspected disorder and management is determined by treatment of the underlying disease causing the headache.

### Misdiagnosis of acute headache: mitigating medico-legal risks [^111a8xhG]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Headache is a common complaint of patients in the emergency department. The large majority of them have self-limited causes but some have life, limb, brain, or vision-threatening secondary causes. The job of the emergency physicians is to distinguish the 2 groups. This article focuses on clinical tips to avoid or at least mitigate medico-legal risk in patients with headache. Each process of care-history, physical examination, laboratory testing, brain imaging, spinal fluid analysis, specialist consultation, and documentation-will be considered.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for tension-type headache, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ACR 2023 guidelines recommend to obtain imaging (CT or MRI) to exclude secondary causes of elevated ICP in patients with headache with features of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. (Usually Appropriate) Consider obtaining venous imaging techniques, such as MRV or CTV, as complementary modalities in selected clinical settings.

Evaluation and treatment of headache — triage begins by asking if the patient needs urgent/emergent evaluation/treatment or has red flags; if so, consider evaluation in urgent care or ED. If not, assess for a secondary headache, a complicated headache presentation, or multiple headache types requiring specialist referral, and if present refer to specialist for further diagnosis and evaluation. If these are absent, evaluate for TTH by features including bilateral headache, non-pulsatile pain, mild to moderate pain, and not worsened by activity; if present, proceed to TTH treatment and also assess for MOH. If TTH features are absent, evaluate for migraine by features including nausea, throbbing, and headache-related interference in activities; if present, proceed to migraine treatment and also assess for MOH. If migraine features are absent, evaluate for cluster headache by features including bouts of severe and brief headaches lasting < 3 hours, unilateral (always same side), autonomic signs ipsilateral to headache, and restlessness during attacks; if present, proceed to cluster headache treatment and also assess for MOH. If none of these pathways apply, revisit general history and physical exam and consider alternate diagnoses or referral for specialty evaluation.

### Managing toxicities associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors: consensus recommendations from the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) toxicity management working group [^112ShkJj]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Management of confirmed hypophysitis includes replacement of deficient hormones (physiologic doses of steroids and thyroid hormone). In the presence of both adrenal insufficiency and hypothyroidism, steroids should always be started prior to thyroid hormone in order to avoid an adrenal crisis. High doses of steroids are necessary in the setting of severe headaches, vision changes or adrenal crisis. Both adrenal insufficiency and hypothyroidism appear to represent long term sequelae of hypophysitis and lifelong hormonal replacement is needed in most cases. All patients with adrenal insufficiency should be instructed to obtain and carry a medical alert bracelet.

Thyroid dysfunction

Thyroid dysfunction (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroiditis) was reported in 6–20% of patients in large phase 3 clinical trials.

Hypothyroidism

Patients with unexplained fatigue, weight gain, hair loss, cold intolerance, constipation, depression and other recognized symptoms should be suspected of having hypothyroidism. Lab tests showing high TSH and low free T4 are indicative of biochemical hypothyroidism and, if present, additional testing for thyroid antibodies such as thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody is warranted. Patients with confirmed hypothyroidism should be started on thyroid hormone, with repeat TSH and free T4 levels evaluated 6–8 weeks later. Once a maintenance dose is identified (TSH within normal range) clinical and biochemical re-evaluation should be undertaken every 12 months.

Chronic classification across primary headaches is defined differently: for migraine and tension-type headache (TTH), chronic refers to frequent headaches occurring on 15 or more days per month for more than 3 months; for cluster headache, chronic refers to headaches occurring for 1 year or longer without remission or with remission periods lasting fewer than 3 months; because primary headaches are recurrent, a single or first-time headache should prompt appropriate evaluation for secondary causes, and these criteria apply only if the diagnosis is not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis.

Conclusions

Diagnosis of chronic headache disorders can be challenging for non-expert clinicians. Depending on the clinical or research need, there are a number of adequate tools available that could be used in specific contexts. Nevertheless, there are currently no tools validated in primary care that can be used by non-expert clinicians to classify chronic headache disorders that also allow the user to screen for primary headaches other than migraine and TTH. The availability of such a tool could support primary care clinicians in diagnosing and managing chronic headache disorders within primary care, and allow more targeted referral to headache specialists.
