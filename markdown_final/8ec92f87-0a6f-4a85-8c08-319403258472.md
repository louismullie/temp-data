## Question

Cannabis use and opioid overdose correlation in chronic pain patients

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether medical cannabis use in chronic pain patients reduces opioid overdose risk, and how to interpret the mixed evidence base to guide clinical decisions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biological plausibility of an opioid-sparing effect and whether dose reduction translates into lower overdose risk. Then, I should verify what high-quality cohort studies show about opioid dose changes with medical cannabis. Next, I will examine patient-level safety outcomes with concomitant cannabis and opioids, followed by population-level data on opioid mortality. After that, I need to check guideline positions and weigh patient-level risk modifiers. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion and monitoring plan, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the biological plausibility and the dose–risk relationship. Cannabinoids and opioids share overlapping neurobiological pathways, and preclinical data suggest additive or synergistic analgesia, which could theoretically enable opioid dose reduction while maintaining pain control, although human data are mixed and certainty is low to moderate at best [^113LMfHG] [^117X74vR]. I should confirm that higher prescribed opioid doses are consistently associated with increased overdose risk; yes, multiple observational analyses and guidelines describe a dose-dependent rise in overdose risk as morphine milligram equivalents increase, supporting the concept that lowering MME could reduce overdose risk if analgesia is preserved [^112ubsqX] [^114WhQLG].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality patient-level evidence on dose reduction. The 2023 JAMA Network Open cohort of 8,165 New York patients on long-term opioid therapy found that longer-duration medical cannabis exposure was associated with larger monthly MME reductions, with a clear dose–response by baseline opioid dose strata; for example, about a 48% reduction in the lowest MME group and about a 51% reduction in the highest MME group over 8 months, compared with minimal reductions in the short-exposure group [^113TAord] [^112Nq8k3]. Wait, let me verify whether this could reflect selection bias or policy pressure; the authors acknowledge they cannot prove causality and note no regulatory prohibition on co-prescribing, but the magnitude and dose–response pattern are biologically coherent and clinically meaningful, suggesting a plausible opioid-sparing association rather than mere secular decline [^116PTEEo] [^113Adsmk].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about overdose outcomes just because doses fall. I need to check patient-level safety signals when cannabis and opioids are combined. A large VA cohort of patients prescribed opioids found that cannabis use detected on urine drug testing was associated with increased risks of ED visits, hospitalizations, and mortality at 90 and 180 days, with stronger signals in adults aged 65 and older, indicating potential additive harms when co-used, even if the mechanism is not fully elucidated [^113X9pqt]. Hmm, wait a minute, could confounding by indication explain this? Possibly, but the consistency across sensitivity analyses and the dose–response by age argue for a real signal that warrants caution in clinical practice [^113X9pqt].

> I will now examine population-level data on overdose mortality. Early ecological studies reported that states with medical cannabis laws had lower opioid analgesic overdose mortality, with reductions strengthening over time, which fueled optimism about substitution effects [^115fVqt8]. But wait, I should double-check whether newer analyses replicate this. Contemporary studies and reviews suggest the association is inconsistent, with some analyses finding no reduction or even increased opioid-related harms in certain contexts, underscoring that ecological designs are vulnerable to confounding and that policy effects may vary by implementation and market dynamics [^112AZXDD] [^113ZfC6p]. Let me reconsider: this means population data neither confirm nor refute a protective effect at the individual level, so I should not over-interpret state-level trends when counseling patients [^113ZfC6p].

> Next, I should review guidelines to anchor clinical judgment. The BMJ 2021 guideline issues a weak recommendation for a trial of non-inhaled cannabinoids for chronic pain when standard care is insufficient, emphasizing shared decision-making due to small benefits and mostly transient harms, which supports cautious, adjunctive use rather than substitution [^112c2XYj] [^116rGw9a]. The 2024 ACP best-practice advice advises counseling that harms likely outweigh benefits in adolescents, those with current or past SUD, serious mental illness, or frailty, reinforcing selective use and risk stratification [^1126mHjR] [^114ytUqW]. I should confirm specialty guidance: ASIPP suggests cannabinoids may be considered as adjuncts in patients on moderate to high opioid doses not meeting goals, again as an adjunct with monitoring rather than a blanket substitute [^113rZnRp] [^116M1Bxh].

> I need to ensure I account for patient-level risk modifiers that could blunt benefits or amplify harms. Concurrent psychiatric comorbidity, especially depression and anxiety, and a history of substance use disorder are associated with higher opioid misuse and overdose risk, and concomitant cannabis use may correlate with aberrant opioid behaviors in some cohorts, warranting closer monitoring and, in some cases, avoidance of cannabis co-use [^114s1bmK] [^114SrRAG]. But wait, what if the patient is already on high-dose opioids with poor control? In that scenario, a carefully monitored cannabinoid trial may still be reasonable as part of a taper plan, provided there is robust risk mitigation and consent about uncertainties [^113rZnRp].

> Let me synthesize the evidence signal. On one hand, robust cohort data show clinically significant opioid dose reductions with sustained medical cannabis exposure, and dose reduction plausibly lowers overdose risk given the MME–overdose relationship, suggesting potential benefit if analgesia and function are maintained [^113TAord] [^112ubsqX]. On the other hand, patient-level safety data show increased ED use, hospitalization, and mortality with concomitant cannabis and opioids, and ecological mortality findings are inconsistent, so we cannot conclude that cannabis reduces overdose risk at the individual level with confidence [^113X9pqt] [^113ZfC6p]. I should double-check that this aligns with guidelines: yes, recommendations remain cautious, favoring selective, adjunctive trials with explicit risk–benefit discussions rather than substitution or routine co-use [^112c2XYj] [^1126mHjR].

> Now, I should translate this into a practical clinical approach. For patients with chronic pain on long-term opioids who are not meeting functional goals or are experiencing adverse effects, a time-limited trial of non-inhaled cannabinoids can be considered as an adjunct, with a plan to reduce opioid dose if pain and function improve, while avoiding unsupervised co-use and prioritizing harm-reduction strategies such as naloxone distribution and PDMP checks [^112c2XYj] [^113ybRL7]. I need to ensure risk stratification: avoid or use extreme caution in patients with SUD, serious mental illness, cognitive impairment, or high fall risk, and document shared decision-making about uncertainties and potential adverse effects, including cognitive and psychotomimetic risks and impaired driving [^1126mHjR] [^111ZFris]. Hold on, I should verify monitoring: regular assessment of pain, function, mood, adherence, and substance use, with urine drug testing as clinically indicated, is essential to detect aberrant behaviors and guide safe tapering if benefits are not realized [^1116uhNt] [^114qvrhb].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the bottom line. Current evidence suggests that medical cannabis can lead to meaningful reductions in opioid dose for some chronic pain patients, which may lower overdose risk, but concomitant cannabis–opioid use is also associated with increased near-term harms in observational cohorts, and population data on overdose mortality are inconsistent; therefore, any opioid-sparing benefit must be balanced against potential risks and implemented with careful selection, close monitoring, and explicit goals for dose reduction and functional gain [^113TAord] [^113X9pqt] [^113ZfC6p]. I need to ensure the plan remains individualized, with a low threshold to modify or discontinue the cannabinoid trial if benefits do not emerge or risks emerge, consistent with guideline-based, harm-reduction–oriented pain care [^112c2XYj] [^1129F96H].

Cannabis use in chronic pain patients is associated with modest opioid dose reductions [^113TAord] [^1162SfE5], but **does not reliably lower opioid overdose risk** [^113ZfC6p]. Observational data show dose reductions with medical cannabis [^113TAord] [^117D6Tab], yet **no robust evidence shows fewer overdoses** [^113ZfC6p]. Some studies link cannabis to higher opioid misuse and aberrant behaviors [^114s1bmK] [^111mi42U], and population data on overdose mortality are mixed [^113ZfC6p] [^115fVqt8]. Clinicians should use caution, monitor closely, and apply existing opioid risk mitigation strategies [^113ybRL7]; cannabis is not a proven overdose-prevention tool [^113ZfC6p].

## Evidence of opioid dose reduction associated with cannabis use

Several studies report that chronic pain patients using cannabis reduce opioid doses:

- **New York State cohort (2017–2019)**: Longer medical cannabis use was associated with significant opioid dose reductions, with larger reductions at higher baseline doses (mean daily MME fell by 48% in the lowest, 47% in the middle, and 51% in the highest baseline strata) [^113TAord] [^112Nq8k3].

- **Canadian prospective study**: Among 1,145 chronic pain patients, mean opioid dose dropped from 152 mg to 32.2 mg MME over 6 months — a 78% reduction — with improved quality of life [^1162SfE5].

- **Israeli prospective study**: Small but significant reductions in opioid prescriptions were observed over 6 months with medical cannabis [^notfound].

These findings suggest an **opioid-sparing effect**, but they are observational and vulnerable to confounding and self-selection [^1157drRt].

---

## Evidence regarding opioid overdose risk

Despite dose reductions, **evidence does not show consistent reductions in overdose risk**:

- **VA cohort (2022)**: Cannabis use was associated with increased risks of ED visits, hospitalization, and mortality at 90 and 180 days among patients prescribed opioids, especially in those aged ≥ 65 years [^113X9pqt].

- **Australian cohort (2018)**: No evidence that cannabis use reduced prescribed opioid use or increased discontinuation; cannabis users had greater pain severity and anxiety [^1132nqZz].

- **Veterans Health Administration (2025)**: Medical cannabis laws were associated with increased opioid use disorder, particularly in middle-aged and older adults with chronic pain [^112AZXDD].

These data indicate that **cannabis use does not reliably reduce overdose risk** and may be associated with harm in some settings [^113ZfC6p].

---

## Mechanisms underlying the relationship

Potential mechanisms include **opioid-sparing analgesia** via cannabinoid–opioid interactions [^113LMfHG] and substitution, whereby patients replace opioids with cannabis [^115NUry8]. However, risks may arise from **additive sedative effects** with combined use, increased misuse behaviors [^114s1bmK], and limited evidence of clinical benefit [^112c2XYj].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize caution and shared decision-making:

- **BMJ 2021**: Weak recommendation for a trial of non-inhaled cannabinoids when standard care is insufficient; benefits are small and harms modest [^112c2XYj] [^116rGw9a].

- **ACP 2025**: Counsel that harms likely outweigh benefits in patients with SUD, serious mental illness, or frailty risk [^1126mHjR] [^114ytUqW].

- **ASIPP 2023**: Cannabinoids may be considered as adjuncts in moderate/high opioid doses, with close monitoring [^114s1bmK] [^116M1Bxh].

---

## Limitations and gaps in current research

Key limitations include **lack of randomized trials** testing cannabis's effect on overdose risk, heterogeneity in products, doses, and populations, and confounding by self-selection and policy shifts [^1157drRt]. Long-term safety and interaction data remain limited [^1137rBJd].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

Given current evidence, clinicians should:

- **Monitor closely**: Use PDMP checks, urine drug testing, and regular follow-up [^1129F96H] [^1116uhNt].

- **Apply risk mitigation**: Use naloxone, educate on overdose risk, and avoid high-risk combinations (e.g. benzodiazepines) [^113ybRL7] [^115doxPS].

- **Individualize care**: Consider cannabis only after standard options fail, with informed consent about uncertain benefits and potential harms [^112c2XYj] [^115Vr6Hb].

---

Cannabis may reduce opioid doses in some chronic pain patients, but **does not reliably lower overdose risk** [^113TAord] [^113ZfC6p]; evidence is mixed and largely observational [^113X9pqt]. Clinicians should prioritize established risk-mitigation strategies and shared decision-making when considering cannabis as an adjunct [^113ybRL7].

Key Points

Question

Is receiving medical cannabis for a longer duration associated with reducing prescription opioid dosages among patients receiving long-term opioid therapy?

Findings

In this cohort study among 8165 patients with chronic pain receiving long-term opioid therapy, receiving medical cannabis for a longer duration was associated with prescription opioid dosage reduction. Higher opioid dosages were associated with larger reductions.

Meaning

These findings contribute evidence toward potential clinical benefits of medical cannabis in reducing prescription opioid intake, which may decrease patients' risk of opioid overdose.

Introduction

The US has been experiencing an opioid crisis with multiple waves, starting with increased prescribing of opioids in the 1990s. Recently, opioid-involved overdose deaths in 2021 were the highest in US history, with more than 80 000 deaths. Opioid prescriptions decreased 47% by 2020, after a peak in 2012 with 255 million prescriptions. Despite significant reductions, many people are continuing to use opioids for chronic pain. In 2019, 1 in 5 adults had chronic painand 22.1% of these had recently used prescription opioids for relief.

National guidelines for prescribing opioids for chronic painand states' opioid regulations have resulted in discontinuation and reduced initiation of opioid prescriptions. Nonopioid medication options are limited for many individuals with pain; for example, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are contraindicated for many patients experiencing chronic pain, particularly among older patients, who often experience a higher burden of pain. Without humane tapering of opioids and effective alternatives for patients receiving long-term opioid therapy (LOT), many of them are at high risk of overdose (through turning to the illicit market) and of suicide.

### Recreational and medical cannabis legalization and opioid prescriptions and mortality [^1141ocxh]. JAMA Health Forum (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Despite the efforts of many parties, the opioid epidemic persists in the US, with more individuals experiencing fatal overdoses during 2021 than any year on record. Continued opioid-related harms have generated interest in potential mechanisms to ameliorate the crisis, including the legalization of cannabis for recreational or medical use. For example, it is theoretically possible that individuals with acute or chronic pain may substitute cannabis for prescription opioids, thereby reducing opioid use and opioid-related harms. Greater availability of cannabis, a substance with a much lower risk profile of overdose than opioids, may also be associated with reduced initiation of prescription or illicit opioids. However, many clinical and economic barriers may prevent the substitution of cannabis for prescription opioids or the translation of such substitution into reduction in downstream harms. There are also concerns that cannabis may serve as a gateway to illegal drug use.

### Cannabis based medicines and cannabis dependence: a critical review of issues and evidence [^1113hP3J]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Although medical cannabis use may lead to dependence, it compares favourably in regards to safety and tolerability with other drugs, such as opioids, and it is important to weigh up the benefits of use vs the risk of dependence. Many of the conditions for which medical cannabis is used are chronic, highlighting the need for a medicine with a good safety profile. Especially for chronic pain patients, adverse effects may only play a limited role, even tolerance or dependence. Other medications currently used for chronic pain, such as pregabalin and opioids, have a higher potential for abuse and dependency, and may cause more severe withdrawal symptoms after cessation than medical cannabis. When prescribing, physicians need to take this trade-off into consideration, particularly when use is long-term. In their long-term observational study of 180 chronic pain patients, found that medical cannabis can indeed diminish prescription opioid usage, working as a preferred alternative to prescription opioids in over half of their patients.

The issue of CUD has become more relevant in relation to other emerging trends in drug dependence particularly the current opioid crisis in the United States. Here, there is a nationwide federal focus on prescription opioid harm reduction strategies, that includes alternative therapies for pain management, such as medical cannabis. There is a developing evidence base that some chronic pain patients are able to substitute opioids with medical cannabis (e.g.;). Furthermore, identified a reduction in opioid overdose deaths in those US states that legalised medical cannabis. In this arena it is vital that appropriate definitions of addiction and dependence to opioid substitute medicines are followed to avoid conflating opioid dependence with medical cannabis use.

Similarly, medical cannabis users often also have lower levels of alcohol-use disorders and non-cannabis drug use severity compared to recreational users which might indicate that medical cannabis use may reduce ('substitute' for) other psychoactive substance use, including alcohol. Again, relative dependence potential of the different drugs needs to be taken into account.

Conclusions

This cohort study found that receiving MC for longer was associated with opioid dosage reductions. The reductions were larger among individuals who were prescribed higher dosages of opioids at baseline. These findings contribute robust evidence for clinicians regarding the potential benefits of MC in reducing the opioid burden for patients receiving LOT and possibly reduce their risk for overdose. Further research is needed to confirm the causal effect of MC and conduct benefit-risk assessment of MC as opioid alternative or companion treatments to address management of chronic pain and the opioid crisis.

Regarding medical management for opioids for pain, more specifically with respect to non-opioid therapies, CCP-CEG 2023 guidelines recommend to offer cannabinoid-based medicines as an adjunct treatment for chronic pain in patients taking any dose of opioids not reaching chronic pain goals, experiencing opioid-related adverse events, or displaying risk factors for opioid-related harm.

### The association between cannabis use and aberrant behaviors during chronic opioid therapy for chronic pain [^114s1bmK]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Health care providers are likely to see an increase in the concomitant use of cannabis and opioids, particularly with the increased liberalization and ongoing research into the possible role of medical marijuana for chronic pain. Recent literature reports a prevalence of concurrent use ranging from 8.9% to 31.8%. The primary aim of this study was to determine the relationship between cannabis use and aberrant drug behaviors in noncancer pain patients receiving chronic opioid therapy.

Design

Retrospective chart review.

Setting

Community-based, interdisciplinary pain management center.

Subjects

Data from 209 patients who were evaluated for a medication management program between October 1, 2011, and January 1, 2014, and met inclusion criteria. Forty-four were positive for cannabis in their initial random urine drug toxicology.

Methods

Data from electronic health records, including demographics, urine drug toxicology, disability, opioid dose, opioid risk assessment data, and pain severity were analyzed to examine differences among cannabis users and noncannabis users.

Results

Subjects with cannabis in their initial urine drug toxicology were more likely to have a future occurrence of an opioid-related aberrancy (P < 0.001), be male (P = 0.047), have a history of substance abuse (P = 0.013), and be enrolled into a higher level of clinical monitoring of opioid medication use (P = 0.008). No other associations with demographic and clinical variables reached statistical significance.

Conclusions

Concurrent use of cannabis and opioids by patients with chronic pain appears to indicate higher risk for opioid misuse. Closer monitoring for opioid-related aberrancy is indicated for this group of patients.

### Patient experience and perspective on medical cannabis as an alternative for musculoskeletal pain management [^1143QLCv]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

The increasing use of opioids for pain management has raised concerns about their potential abuse and dangerous adverse effects. Currently, the United States accounts for 80% of the global opioid consumption, generating a narcotic crisis that costs approximately $78.5 billion annually. This situation has led to an increment in the number of deaths secondary to opioid overdose, with more than 750,000 deceases in the United States since 1999. In addition, a 1.68 million person-year life loss was reported in 2016, with the highest incidence among people of the age of 24 and 25 years (20% of the deaths). Contrarily, opioid misuse is another critical concern, with statistics ranging from 21% to 29% in patients with chronic pain and 4% to 6% in patients transitioning to heroin use. Persistent opioid use has been associated with reasons other than the intensity of the surgical pain, generating a harmful situation for the patients due to the disproportionate use of these narcotics.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^117GjJN2]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

Marijuana — evidence of effectiveness and utilization patterns in chronic pain: The potential analgesic effect of cannabinoids with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in humans has been experimentally suggested, but the results are mixed and the effect for acute pain is limited; the route of administration by either vaporization or oral did not yield significant differences, and marijuana did have more side effects than placebo. The page notes evidence that opioids and cannabis together decreased the opioid need or load and therefore would be associated with decreased deaths, with cannabis potentially safer than opioids alone. Utilization trends show that, comparing 2012 to 2017, cannabinoid use increased more than 60% while opioid use decreased approximately 30%. It also states there is some evidence to suggest cannabinoid use has improved opioid-related adverse events and reduced overall use, and cites a National Academies' conclusion of "conclusive and substantial evidence" that marijuana is a good treatment for chronic pain in adults.

### Cannabis legalization and opioid use disorder in veterans health administration patients [^116B3MfF]. JAMA Health Forum (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

In the US, opioid use disorder (OUD) affects more than 6.5 million adults.OUD, which is characterized by a pattern of opioid use contributing to impairment and distress, is associated with opioid overdose, and psychiatric, medical, and psychosocial health consequences. Many individual-level factors contribute to OUD risk, including younger age, male sex, opioid use, other substance use disorders (SUDs), and chronic pain persisting 3 months or longer. Unremitting rates of OUDmake identifying OUD risk factors an ongoing, urgent public health need to aid in its prevention and treatment.

Cannabis legalization may be 1 factor associated with OUD prevalence. As of 2024, 39 US states have enacted medical cannabis laws (MCLs), and 24 states and Washington, DC, have additionally enacted recreational cannabis laws (RCLs). MCLs/RCLs could be associated with decreased OUD via 2 mechanisms. One involves pain management. While opioid prescriptions have declined, they are still widely dispensed for pain. Chronic pain is now among the most common medical conditions for which cannabis is authorized, and many adults perceive cannabis as an effective treatment for chronic pain. Ecological studies have indirectly suggested that cannabis is used in place of opioids following MCL enactment, potentially reducing opioid-related consequences, including development of OUD. The other mechanism involves cannabis as treatment for OUD, which is now a qualifying condition for medical cannabis in 3 US states (New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania). In some OUD treatment studies, cannabis use was associated with reductions in opioid dose, less opioid craving, and greater engagement and retention, potentially reducing OUD burden in states with legal access to cannabis. However, prospective studies have shown that cannabis use is associated with an increased risk of opioid use, and may be used as a complement to opioids, which could be associated with increases in OUD if cannabis use is legalized.

### General risks of harm with cannabinoids, cannabis, and cannabis-based medicine possibly relevant to patients receiving these for pain management: an overview of systematic reviews [^1137rBJd]. Pain (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The growing demand for improved pain treatments together with expanding legalization of, and access to, cannabinoids, cannabis, and cannabis-based medicines has intensified the focus on risk-benefit considerations in pain management. Given limited harms data from analgesic clinical trials, we conducted an overview of systematic reviews focused on all harms possibly relevant to patients receiving cannabinoids for pain management. This PROSPERO-registered, PRISMA-compliant systematic overview identified 79 reviews, encompassing over 2200 individual reports about psychiatric and psychosocial harms, cognitive/behavioral effects, motor vehicle accidents, cardiovascular, respiratory, cancer-related, maternal/fetal, and general harms. Reviews, and their included studies, were of variable quality. Available evidence suggests variable associations between cannabis exposure (ranging from monthly to daily use based largely on self-report) and psychosis, motor vehicle accidents, respiratory problems, and other harms. Most evidence comes from settings other than that of pain management (eg, nonmedicinal and experimental) but does signal a need for caution and more robust harms evaluation in future studies. Given partial overlap between patients receiving cannabinoids for pain management and individuals using cannabinoids for other reasons, lessons from the crisis of oversupply and overuse of opioids in some parts of the world emphasize the need to broadly consider harms evidence from real-world settings. The advancement of research on cannabinoid harms will serve to guide optimal approaches to the use of cannabinoids for pain management. In the meantime, this evidence should be carefully examined when making risk-benefit considerations about the use of cannabinoids, cannabis, and cannabis-based medicine for chronic pain.

### Association of a positive drug screening for cannabis with mortality and hospital visits among veterans affairs enrollees prescribed opioids [^113X9pqt]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

In this cohort study, we did not find evidence of reduced harms associated with cannabis use among individuals prescribed opioids. However, we found that cannabis use was associated with increased risk of ED visits, hospitalization, or mortality at 90 days and 180 days among adults prescribed prescription opioids. In individuals aged 65 years or older receiving LTOT, we found evidence of significantly increased short-term risks. These data suggest that cannabis use, like other psychoactive drugs, may be associated with harms if used in combination with prescription opioids.

Several population-based studies examining the association of medical and recreational legalization of cannabis with various metrics of health status have suggested that state-based legalization of cannabis may be associated with decreased opioid prescribing, and decreased opioid-associated deaths at the population level. Another studyfound no association of cannabis legalization with opioid overdose rates. A 2022 studyfound that increasing prevalence of retail cannabis dispensaries was associated with increased opioid-associated mortality. While the literature on the public health outcomes associated with legalization is evolving and yet unclear, these studies did not examine the association of cannabis use with health outcomes among individuals prescribed opioids at the patient level. Although we are unaware of other studies that have examined the association of cannabis use with clinical outcomes, such as ED visits, hospitalization, or mortality, among individuals prescribed opioids, several studies have examined the association of cannabis use with other health metrics in this population at increased risk. A cross-sectional studyof 186 patients with chronic back pain found that medical cannabis use was associated with reduced prescription opioid use. However, larger prospective studies in select populations have not confirmed those findings. A prospective cohort studyof 1514 patients with chronic pain found that cannabis use among patients using opioids was not associated with reduced opioid use or opioid discontinuation. Similarly we did not find an association with a reduction in harms.

### The prevalence and significance of cannabis use in patients prescribed chronic opioid therapy: a review of the extant literature [^111mi42U]. Pain Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Cannabis is the most widely consumed illicit drug in the United States. Its use, particularly in early initiates, is associated with subsequent development of other drug and alcohol use disorders.

Objective

The authors examined the prevalence of cannabis use and the association between cannabis use and aberrant opioid-related behaviors in patients prescribed chronic opioid therapy for persistent pain.

Methods

PubMed was queried for studies of chronic opioid therapy in which aberrant opioid-related behaviors were quantitatively examined and in which cannabis use data (as determined by cannabinoid-positive urine drug tests) were extricable from that of other substances of abuse.

Results

The prevalence of cannabis use among patients prescribed chronic opioid therapy in these studies ranged from 6.2% to 39%, compared with 5.8% in the general United States population. Furthermore, cannabis use in chronic opioid patients shows statistically significant associations with present and future aberrant opioid-related behaviors.

Conclusion

Cannabis use is prevalent in patients prescribed chronic opioid therapy and is associated with opioid misuse. Further research is necessary to clarify the strength and the nature of the association between cannabis use and opioid misuse, and to address additional questions about the consequences of cannabis use in the context of chronic opioid therapy.

### Cannabis legalization and opioid use disorder in veterans health administration patients [^112AZXDD]. JAMA Health Forum (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

This cohort study demonstrated that MCL was associated with increased rates of OUD, with even greater increases in middle-aged and older adults, and patients with chronic pain who were residing in states that also enacted RCL. Findings suggest that cannabis policies and increasing access to legal cannabis were not associated with a reduced burden of OUD. US states considering cannabis legislation to combat the opioid epidemic should consider potential unintended consequences on the prevalence of OUD and other opioid-related health outcomes. Our results should encourage careful regulation of cannabis distribution following legalization and monitoring of OUD symptoms among patients residing in MCL/RCL states, alongside concerted surveillance efforts in older adults who may be particularly susceptible to cannabis and opioid use risks. Because our study was among the first to our knowledge to examine associations of MCL/RCL with OUD, general population studies are needed to assess the effect of these laws on OUD and other opioid-related harms, including opioid overdose. Moreover, future studies should examine whether certain clinical populations are susceptible to OUD following MCL/RCL enactment, including patients with psychiatric disorders or those with specific pain conditions, or whether cannabis laws may reduce substance use–related stigma or increase substance use reporting and treatment utilization and whether these factors could partially account for changes in OUD following enactment of MCL/RCL. These studies will help identify the mechanisms of the associations we found, inform clinical policies associated with cannabis use, and guide future treatment and prevention efforts of OUD during a time when rates of OUD and opioid overdoses remain high.

### Changes in prescribed opioid dosages among patients receiving medical cannabis for chronic pain, New York state, 2017–2019 [^113TAord]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Patients with chronic pain often receive long-term opioid therapy (LOT), which places them at risk of opioid use disorder and overdose. This presents the need for alternative or companion treatments; however, few studies on the association of medical cannabis (MC) with reducing opioid dosages exist.

Objective

To assess changes in opioid dosages among patients receiving MC for longer duration compared with shorter duration.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study of New York State Prescription Monitoring Program data from 2017 to 2019 included patients receiving MC for chronic pain while also receiving opioid treatment. Of these, patients receiving LOT prior to receiving MC were selected. Individuals were studied for 8 months after starting MC. Data were analyzed from November 2021 to February 2022.

Exposures

Selected patients were divided into 2 groups based on the duration of receiving MC: the nonexposure group received MC for 30 days or fewer, and the exposure group received MC for more than 30 days.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was opioid dosage, measured by mean daily morphine milligram equivalent (MME). Analyses were conducted for 3 strata by opioid dosage prior to receiving MC: MME less than 50, MME of 50 to less than 90, and MME of 90 or greater.

Results

A total of 8165 patients were included, with 4041 (median [IQR] age, 57 [47–65] years; 2376 [58.8%] female) in the exposure group and 4124 (median [IQR] age, 54 (44–62) years; 2370 [57.5%] female) in the nonexposure group. Median (IQR) baseline MMEs for the exposure vs nonexposure groups were 30.0 (20.0–40.0) vs 30.0 (20.0–40.0) in the lowest stratum, 60.0 (60.0–70.0) vs 60.0 (60.0–90.0) in the middle stratum, and 150.0 (100.0–216.2) vs 135.0 (100.0–218.0) in the highest stratum. During follow-up, significantly greater reductions in opioid dosage were observed among the exposure group. A dose-response association of patients' opioid dosage at baseline was observed with the differences in the monthly MME reductions between exposure and nonexposure groups, with a difference of -1.52 (95% CI, -1.67 to -1.37) MME for the lowest stratum, -3.24 (95% CI, -3.61 to -2.87) MME for the middle stratum, and -9.33 (95% CI, -9.89 to -8.77) MME for the highest stratum. The daily MME for the last month of the follow-up period among patients receiving longer MC was reduced by 48% in the lowest stratum, 47% in the middle stratum, and 51% in the highest stratum compared with the baseline dosages. Among individuals in the nonexposure group, daily MME was reduced by only 4% in the lowest stratum, 9% in the middle stratum, and 14% in the highest stratum.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study of patients receiving LOT, receiving MC for a longer duration was associated with reductions in opioid dosages, which may lower their risk of opioid-related morbidity and mortality.

### Medical cannabis or cannabinoids for chronic pain: a clinical practice guideline [^112c2XYj]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What is the role of medical cannabis or cannabinoids for people living with chronic pain due to cancer or non-cancer causes?

Current Practice

Chronic pain is common and distressing and associated with considerable socioeconomic burden globally. Medical cannabis is increasingly used to manage chronic pain, particularly in jurisdictions that have enacted policies to reduce use of opioids; however, existing guideline recommendations are inconsistent, and cannabis remains illegal for therapeutic use in many countries.

Recommendation

The guideline expert panel issued a weak recommendation to offer a trial of non-inhaled medical cannabis or cannabinoids, in addition to standard care and management (if not sufficient), for people living with chronic cancer or non-cancer pain.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international guideline development panel including patients, clinicians with content expertise, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach. The MAGIC Evidence Ecosystem Foundation (MAGIC) provided methodological support. The panel applied an individual patient perspective.

The Evidence

This recommendation is informed by a linked series of four systematic reviews summarising the current body of evidence for benefits and harms, as well as patient values and preferences, regarding medical cannabis or cannabinoids for chronic pain.

Understanding The Recommendation

The recommendation is weak because of the close balance between benefits and harms of medical cannabis for chronic pain. It reflects a high value placed on small to very small improvements in self reported pain intensity, physical functioning, and sleep quality, and willingness to accept a small to modest risk of mostly self limited and transient harms. Shared decision making is required to ensure patients make choices that reflect their values and personal context. Further research is warranted and may alter this recommendation.

### The appropriate use of opiates in chronic pain [^113vXG9e]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic pain is a common but undertreated health problem in the United States. Opioids are effective for moderate-to-severe chronic pain, but these drugs must be used with care due to the risks for overdose and addiction. When initiating opioid treatment, physicians should perform a complete patient history, physical exam, and other appropriate testing and also assess the patient's risk for substance misuse, abuse, or addiction. Patients should be monitored regularly for both improvement of function and for aberrant drug behaviors. With proper monitoring and risk management, patients with chronic pain can be treated effectively and safely with opioids.

### Rational urine drug monitoring in patients receiving opioids for chronic pain: consensus recommendations [^114qvrhb]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Alcohol Screening

For patients with a substance use disorder, alcohol may be problematic and prohibited in any amount; for other patients with chronic pain, only high-risk alcohol use (e.g. binge drinking) is a concern. Many opioids include black box warnings about the concurrent use of alcohol because of the potential for fatal overdose. One reviewed guideline recommends screening for alcohol with UDM in patients with chronic pain; ethyl glucuronide, ethyl sulfate, or ethanol in UDM indicates alcohol use. As a caveat, immunoassay and definitive UDM may not differentiate between alcoholic beverages and alcohol-containing medications, mouthwashes, and hand sanitizers. Instead of UDM, the panelists recommend the SISQ "How many times in the past year have you had (five or more drinks [men], four or more drinks [women]) in a day?" from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism to identify unhealthy alcohol use, as this question is simple to administer and is validated. In primary care settings, the sensitivity of the alcohol SISQ for identifying alcohol use disorder is 88%, and the specificity is 84%.

Cannabis Screening

Practices for cannabis screening vary; individual prescribers can decide whether detecting cannabis by UDM is appropriate by consulting local laws and common practice, as well as by considering the advantages/disadvantages discussed below. At the time of this publication, cannabis is federally illegal (i.e. classified by the US Drug Enforcement Administration as Schedule 1 under the Controlled Substances Act), but several states have passed legislation to decriminalize it for medical and/or recreational use. The CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain indicates that the clinical implications of a positive UDM result for cannabis are uncertain; the VA/US Department of Defense guidelines estimate the length of time it can be detected in urine; and the Washington State guidelines suggest implementing an office policy for patients who use cannabis. These guidelines and this consensus report do not provide formal graded recommendations for or against UDM screening for cannabis or for interpretation of the results.

### Cannabis significantly reduces the use of prescription opioids and improves quality of life in authorized patients: results of a large prospective study [^1162SfE5]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This article presents findings from a large prospective examination of Canadian medical cannabis patients, with a focus on the impacts of cannabis on prescription opioid use and quality of life over a 6-month period.

Methods

The Tilray Observational Patient Study took place at 21 medical clinics throughout Canada. This analysis includes 1,145 patients who had at least one postbaseline visit, with follow-up at 1, 3, and 6 months. Instruments included a comprehensive cannabis use inventory, the World Health Organization Quality of Life Short Form (WHOQOL-BREF), and a detailed prescription drug questionnaire.

Results

Participants were 57.6% female, with a median age of 52 years. Baseline opioid use was reported by 28% of participants, dropping to 11% at 6 months. Daily opioid use went from 152 mg morphine milligram equivalent (MME) at baseline to 32.2 mg MME at 6 months, a 78% reduction in mean opioid dosage. Similar reductions were also seen in the other four primary prescription drug classes identified by participants, and statistically significant improvements were reported in all four domains of the WHOQOL-BREF.

Conclusions

This study provides an individual-level perspective of cannabis substitution for opioids and other prescription drugs, as well as associated improvement in quality of life over 6 months. The high rate of cannabis use for chronic pain and the subsequent reductions in opioid use suggest that cannabis may play a harm reduction role in the opioid overdose crisis, potentially improving the quality of life of patients and overall public health.

### Cannabis legalization does not influence patient compliance with opioid therapy [^115Q4w6q]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Prescription opioid use and opioid related deaths continue to increase nationwide. Several states have adopted legislation allowing for recreational use of cannabis. Little is known about how recreational cannabis laws impact compliance in chronic pain patients who have been prescribed opioid therapy. The goals of this study were to (1) retrospectively assess the effect of cannabis use on compliance with opioid therapy in a high-risk patient population and (2) determine the impact of legalization of recreational cannabis on patients prescribed therapeutic opioids.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study on results from a "high-risk" urine drug testing panel. Results from 1 year before and 1 year after initiation of recreational cannabis legislation were analyzed. This testing panel included qualitative assays for cannabinoids and 9 other common drugs of abuse in addition to a quantitative LC-MS/MS assay for 23 different opioids and metabolites. Opioid compliance was assigned by reviewing pathologists' interpretations.

Results

In the pre-legalization period, 1776 panels were performed, and in the post-legalization, 1648 panels were performed. An increase (6%) in the rate of positive cannabinoids screening results was observed after legalization of recreational cannabis; however, the overall compliance rate was consistent.

Conclusions

The results of this study suggest that legalization of recreational cannabis does not affect compliance rate in patients treated with opioid therapy for chronic pain.

### ASRA pain medicine consensus guidelines on the management of the perioperative patient on cannabis and cannabinoids [^117X74vR]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Perioperative opioids in patients using cannabis — statements and recommendations: Cannabinoid studies in patients taking opioids for chronic pain suggest that there may be a therapeutic benefit of low-dose THC on pain and opioid use, but the opioid-sparing effect is not apparent in the setting of acute pain (Level of certainty: Low). None of the studies reviewed identified any increase in significant adverse events with the co-administration of THC and an opioid in experimental studies with healthy volunteers, and few studies reported on these outcomes in the clinical setting (Level of certainty: Low). Opioids may be administered when indicated for the management of postoperative pain in patients who use cannabis with increased vigilance (Grade C), and there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against adjusting postoperative opioid requirements in surgical patients who consume cannabinoids (Grade I).

### Changes in prescribed opioid dosages among patients receiving medical cannabis for chronic pain, New York state, 2017–2019 [^116PTEEo]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

We did not have information to determine whether patients chose MC as an adjunct therapy to decrease opioid dosages or in response to clinician pressure to decrease opioid dosages. However, no regulations prohibited the use of opioids and MC simultaneously. The clinical significance of the opioid reductions associated with MC is illustrated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guideline on prescribing opioids for chronic pain, which highlights the escalation of overdose risk as prescribed MME increases. Clinicians caring for patients receiving LOT should discuss the role MC may play in pain management and information on risks and benefits. When patients wish to use MC and their current clinician is unable or unwilling to certify patients, they should be referred to practitioner who could certify patients for MC.

Patients with chronic pain who are insured by Medicaid receive opioids at a higher rate than privately insured individuals and are more likely to be receiving LOT. Few patients in the study population were insured by Medicaid, and of those, many who initiated MC did not continue. This may be because MC is typically not covered by insurance and was thus unaffordable. The lack of affordability of a medication that may reduce the need for opioids for pain management and perhaps risk of opioid use disorder and overdose is a health inequity deserving further examination.

MC is documented to have side effects: among the most common are psychoactive effects, dizziness, and dry mouth. Other concerns include cannabis use disorder and withdrawal symptoms. New York state regulations allowed MC products with THC to be sold by dispensaries; however, THC was limited at a low dose of 10 mg. Therefore, the risk of adverse events and cannabis use disorder is low if patients use MC as directed. A previous study of MC found that while 37.3% of patients experienced 1 or more adverse events, most were mild, and less than 2% of patients required dose adjustment or cessation, suggesting that MC is far safer than opioids. However, caution is still urged in certifying patients with some comorbidities, including coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, or a history of psychosis, or patients who are pregnant.

Chronic coronary disease — substance use overview and opioid caution: Various substances can have adverse cardiovascular effects and interact with cardiovascular therapies, and some are illicit, limiting evidence; although observational data show a J-shaped association between alcohol and cardiovascular risk, no randomized controlled trials support moderate alcohol use to reduce risk, and recent studies suggest no safe level; cannabis has cardiac-specific effects and long-term cardiovascular risk data are lacking; because of potential cardiac toxicity, drug-drug interactions, and high risk for misuse, long-term opioid use for patients with chronic coronary disease (CCD) and chronic pain should be avoided.

### The endocannabinoid system-current implications for drug development [^1177M9ox]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Two other issues should be mentioned: whether or not THC enhances the analgesic effects of opioids and whether or not the changes in legislation have impacted the opioid epidemic in the United States. With respect to the former, population and observational studies have given conflicting results, and in their review, Babalonis and Walsh concluded that 'the extant controlled clinical data do not support the role of cannabinoids for opioid replacement or opioid‐sparing effects when treating opioid use disorder or chronic pain'. With respect to the latter, data suggesting this to be the case in USA states that adopted medical cannabis early was not found in states that changed their medical cannabis laws at a later date, possibly because of the degree of regulation of dispensaries was different in the later states. The type of opioid in question was also an important parameter in determining the impact of cannabis on opioid‐based overdoses and deaths.

### Risk factors for opioid-use disorder and overdose [^113JxqA5]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2017). Low credibility.

Opioid analgesics are recognized as a legitimate medical therapy for selected patients with severe chronic pain that does not respond to other therapies. However, opioids are associated with risks for patients and society that include misuse, abuse, diversion, addiction, and overdose deaths. Therapeutic success depends on proper candidate selection, assessment before administering opioid therapy, and close monitoring throughout the course of treatment. Risk assessment and prevention include knowledge of patient factors that may contribute to misuse, abuse, addiction, suicide, and respiratory depression. Risk factors for opioid misuse or addiction include past or current substance abuse, untreated psychiatric disorders, younger age, and social or family environments that encourage misuse. Opioid mortality prevalence is higher in people who are middle aged and have substance abuse and psychiatric comorbidities. Suicides are probably undercounted or frequently misclassified in reports of opioid-related poisoning deaths. Greater understanding and better assessment are needed of the risk associated with suicide risk in patients with pain. Clinical tools and an evolving evidence base are available to assist clinicians with identifying patients whose risk factors put them at risk for adverse outcomes with opioids.

### Association of a positive drug screening for cannabis with mortality and hospital visits among veterans affairs enrollees prescribed opioids [^1114CE4t]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Receipt of prescription opioids is associated with adverse events and mortality. Cannabis has been proposed as a therapeutic with potential opioid-sparing properties that could be associated with reduced risk of adverse events among patients treated with prescription opioids. However, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active compound in cannabis, is a psychoactive drug with known adverse effects. In randomized clinical trials examining THC-based pharmaceuticals in the management of pain, adverse events included dizziness, sedation, confusion, loss of balance, nausea, vomiting, and hallucination. Opioids have similar adverse effects but can also cause respiratory depression and death, so the combination of cannabis and opioids could theoretically be associated with greater harm than either drug alone.

Pain is among the most common reasons for use of medical cannabis, and national surveys suggest that cannabis use is common among people prescribed opioids for chronic pain. Although prior studies, have examined self-reported outcomes associated with cannabis use among patients prescribed opioids, no study to our knowledge has examined potential adverse effects (such as emergent care, hospitalization, or mortality) associated with cannabis use in this population. Understanding outcomes associated with cannabis use among patients using opioids is important to patients, clinicians, and policymakers. The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides a unique opportunity to study the association of cannabis use with health outcomes among individuals prescribed opioids. Urine drug screening among patients prescribed opioids for pain has been used as a risk mitigation strategy. Compliance with urine drug screening in this population has been tracked since 2013 and was mandated in 2014. More than 90% of patients prescribed long-term opioids for chronic pain received urine drug screening. Cannabis is measured in the urine drug screening, providing an opportunity to classify patients who received opioids for chronic pain by exposure status (concomitant cannabis use vs no cannabis use).

To better understand health outcomes in this population, we developed a retrospective cohort to examine the association of cannabis use with health outcomes among individuals who received any prescription opioid in the prior 90 days. We repeated this analysis among individuals who received long-term opioid therapy (LTOT; ≥ 84 of the prior 90 days). Because older adults may experience worse side effects associated with psychoactive medications, we repeated analyses among patients who were aged 65 years or older.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^117EVwGi]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

ASIPP chronic non-cancer pain opioid prescribing — conclusion states that the evidence supporting the effectiveness of opioids as a treatment for chronic non-cancer pain is limited, but a general synopsis is that prudent use of opioids can result in significant improvement in patients who are deemed to have medical necessity, and emerging evidence shows the need for opioid (low or moderate dose) therapy in patients with proven medical necessity and stability with improvement in pain and function. Thus, opioids for treatment of chronic non-cancer pain should be reserved for select patients with moderate or severe pain that significantly affects function or QOL. The guidelines offer multiple recommendations for responsible opioid prescribing — inclusive of initial steps of opioid therapy, assessment of the effectiveness of opioid therapy, monitoring adherence and side effects, and the final phase to continue or discontinue opioid therapy on a long-term basis — and overall, 20 recommendations have been identified, each comprising evidence levels and strength of recommendation. Context includes recognition that a CDC document described 3 distinct waves of opioid overdose deaths and this analysis includes a fourth wave described as beginning in 2016 and progressively increasing since then due to multiple factors related to the misapplication of the 2016 CDC guidelines, increased availability of illicit drugs, the COVID-19 pandemic, and policies reducing access to interventional procedures. Despite the focus on prescription opioids, overdose deaths have reached record levels mainly due to the use of illicit fentanyl, and a study in the United States from 2010 to 2019 showed there is no direct correlation between overdoses, OTAs, and prescription opioid pain relief effectiveness.

Management of Chronic Pain

Optimal management of chronic pain involves a combination of medical and psychosocial approaches aimed at shifting the focus of treatment from pain relief towards increased function and well-being despite pain. In actual practice, however, pharmacological therapies continue to be the mainstay of general management of chronic pain. Analgesics for use in chronic pain include paracetamol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids as per the WHO analgesic ladder, supplemented by adjuvant agents (eg muscle relaxants, anxiolytics, or hypnotics). With the possible exceptions of chronic cancer pain and end-of-life care, however, pharmacological analgesia is rarely a sustainable approach to chronic pain management due to safety limitations and abuse/misuse potential associated with prolonged use of these agents.

A major contributing factor to the opioid epidemic in the US was increased opioid prescribing as part of a wider strategy to improve pain management, but ultimately leading to a dramatic increase in the number of prescription opioid overdose deaths. Epidemiological data suggest that opioid misuse is also a concern in Europe.–In 2017, the six countries with the highest opioid consumption (reported as defined daily doses per million inhabitants per day) were, in order, the US, Germany, Canada, Austria, Belgium, and Switzerland.

To control the opioid crisis, guidelines currently recommend against the use of opioids to manage chronic pain. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines advocate non-pharmacological and non-opioid pharmacological therapies as the preferred choices to manage chronic pain. The CDC and American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians guidelines recommend that opioid therapy be considered for chronic pain only if the benefits in terms of pain relief and improved function are likely to outweigh risks to the patient. The European Pain Federation's expert recommendations about safe and appropriate use of opioids in chronic pain management advise that opioid therapy be initiated only after failure of less potent analgesics and adjuvant therapies and/or rehabilitation to achieve and maintain adequate pain relief. In pain types with limited response to opioid medications (eg neuropathic pain), the European Federation of Neurological Societies guidelines recommend a diverse range of agents for first-, second- and third-line treatment (Table 1). These recommendations reflect the varying origins and difficult-to-control nature of chronic neuropathic pain, and also highlight the lack of effective new agents to manage neuropathic pain conditions.

### US trends of opioid-use disorders and associated factors among hospitalized patients with spinal conditions and treatment from 2005 to 2014 [^116V3s79]. Spine (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is the most common reason for opioid prescription in outpatient clinics in the United States. The United States has the highest surgical rate for spinal disorders in the world, and the rate is increasing, despite the similar incidence and prevalence of spinal disorders worldwide. – Considering that CLBP is the most common reason for prescribed opioids, it is common for CLBP patients to be on opioids before spinal surgery. Chronic opioid use is more common among patients who undergo orthopedic surgeries than among those who undergo other types of surgeries. Retrospective studies have revealed that preoperative opioid use in patients with spinal diseases is associated with increased risks of postoperative opioid use and worse surgical outcomes including a higher rate of repeated surgeries.

In 2016, > 11.5 million people reported misuse of prescription pain medicineand 115 Americans to die every day from an opioid overdose. On October 27, 2017, the president declared the opioid crisis a national public health emergency under section 319 of the Public Health Service Act. This declaration was renewed on October 18, 2018, because of the continued consequences of the opioid epidemic. In effect, the opioid-use disorder has been increasing among the general population with some variance in the rate of opioid-related hospitalization depending on age, ethnicity, geographic location, and household income. However, the study on opioid-use disorders among more vulnerable population such as patients with painful spinal conditions and treatment was limited.

Substances abuse and mental health conditions were previously reported to be a contributor to the development of chronic opioid use that begins during the postoperative period. Cannabis remains the most commonly used illicit drug in the United States with an estimated 22.2 million people using it currently, and an additional 2.4 million people reporting first-time use annually. There were increasing emergency department visits related to cannabis use from 2006 to 2014with marijuana legalization in 33 states and the District of Columbia during the last two decades. Although there is an ongoing debate on whether cannabis is a gateway drugor a substitute for opioid use, little attention about the effects of marijuana legalization on opioid-use disorders among patients with spinal conditions and treatment is rising. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the association of cannabis, mental health conditions, and other substances abuse among patients with painful spinal conditions and treatment.

### Patterns and correlates of medical cannabis use for pain among patients prescribed long-term opioid therapy [^111XewdK]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Little is known about co-occurring long-term opioid therapy (LTOT) and medical cannabis use. We compared characteristics of patients prescribed LTOT who endorsed using medical cannabis for pain to patients who did not report cannabis use.

Method

Participants (n = 371) prescribed LTOT completed self-report measures about pain, substance use, and mental health.

Results

Eighteen percent of participants endorsed using medical cannabis for pain. No significant differences were detected on pain-related variables, depression, or anxiety between those who endorsed medical cannabis use and those who did not. Medical cannabis users had higher scores of risk for prescription opioid misuse (median = 17.0 vs. 11.5, p < 0.001), rates of hazardous alcohol use (25% vs. 16%, p < 0.05), and rates of nicotine use (42% vs. 26%, p = 0.01). Multivariable analyses indicated that medical cannabis use was significantly associated with risk of prescription opioid misuse (β = 0.17, p = 0.001), but not hazardous alcohol use (aOR = 1.96, 95% CI = 0.96–4.00, p = 0.06) or nicotine use (aOR = 1.61, 95% CI = 0.90–2.88, p = 0.11).

Conclusion

There are potential risks associated with co-occurring LTOT and medical cannabis for pain. Study findings highlight the need for further clinical evaluation in this population. Future research is needed to examine the longitudinal impact of medical cannabis use on pain-related and substance use outcomes.

Chronic pain on stable opioids — adjunctive vaporized cannabis and withdrawal considerations: In patients taking stable doses of opioids for chronic pain, the administration of vaporized cannabis over 5 days resulted in statistically significant reductions in chronic pain without alterations in blood levels of opioids or changes in pulse oximetry values; cannabinoids may ameliorate the symptoms of opioid withdrawal in humans and animals, and studies of adjunctive cannabinoid administration during opioid detoxification have not found an increased rate of serious adverse events.

### Management of pain with comorbid substance abuse [^114Tsdj4]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Substance use disorders are a large public health problem in the United States. Over the past decade, there has been a trend of increased prescription drug misuse, morbidity, and mortality related to prescription opioids. For providers who treat pain, this has led to clinical dilemmas as the newly appreciated risks must be balanced with the benefits of treatment, particularly in patients with known substance use disorders. Acute, chronic, and palliative each present distinct issues in pain treatment. A best practices model of pain treatment, including risk stratification and integrative treatment, may provide the best prospect for safe and effective treatment.

### Cannabinoid-opioid interaction in chronic pain [^111Ks7jN]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Cannabinoids and opioids share several pharmacologic properties and may act synergistically. The potential pharmacokinetics and the safety of the combination in humans are unknown. We therefore undertook a study to answer these questions. Twenty-one individuals with chronic pain, on a regimen of twice-daily doses of sustained-release morphine or oxycodone were enrolled in the study and admitted for a 5-day inpatient stay. Participants were asked to inhale vaporized cannabis in the evening of day 1, three times a day on days 2–4, and in the morning of day 5. Blood sampling was performed at 12-h intervals on days 1 and 5. The extent of chronic pain was also assessed daily. Pharmacokinetic investigations revealed no significant change in the area under the plasma concentration-time curves for either morphine or oxycodone after exposure to cannabis. Pain was significantly decreased (average 27%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 9, 46) after the addition of vaporized cannabis. We therefore concluded that vaporized cannabis augments the analgesic effects of opioids without significantly altering plasma opioid levels. The combination may allow for opioid treatment at lower doses with fewer side effects.

### Is cannabis being used as a substitute for non-medical opioids by adults with problem substance use in the United States? A within-person analysis [^115c6pDL]. Addiction (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Ecological studies have suggested that Cannabis legalization might have led to a decrease in opioid overdose deaths. Such studies do not provide information about whether individuals are substituting Cannabis for opioids at different points in time. The current study assessed the magnitude of the daily association between Cannabis and opioid use in individual adults with and without pain who use non-medical opioids.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

The greater New York area and a suburban inpatient addiction program.

Participants

Adults with problem substance use who use non-medical opioids, recruited from May 2016-June 2019. The analytical sample included 13271 days of observation among 211 participants (64% male, 41% white, 78% unmarried, 80% unemployed, mean age 43 years).

Measurements

Participants completed interviewer- and self-administered computerized surveys, and then responded to an interactive voice response (IVR) system daily for the following 90 days. The main exposures, Cannabis use and pain, were defined as responding affirmatively to the IVR question: 'Did you use Cannabis yesterday?' and endorsing moderate or severe pain at baseline, respectively. The main outcome, non-medical or illicit opioid use during 90-day follow-up, was defined as responding affirmatively to IVR question: 'Did you use heroin yesterday?' or 'Did you use prescription opioids more than prescribed or without a prescription yesterday?'.

Findings

The mean IVR completion rate was 70%. The unadjusted odds ratio (aOR) indicating same-day use of Cannabis and opioids was 2.00 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.54–2.59]. Controlling for demographic characteristics, recruitment method, opioid types at baseline and pain, the aOR was 1.86 (95% CI = 1.44–2.41). A test of interaction between pain and Cannabis use to determine if the association of Cannabis with opioid use differed between people with moderate-to-severe pain and less-than-moderate pain was inconclusive.

Conclusions

Among US adults with problem substance use who use non-medical opioids, the odds of opioid use appear to be approximately doubled on days when Cannabis is used. This relationship does not appear to differ between people with moderate or more severe pain versus less than moderate pain, suggesting that Cannabis is not being used as a substitute for illegal opioids.

### Disagreement and uncertainty among experts about how to respond to marijuana use in patients on long-term opioids for chronic pain: results of a Delphi study [^116m3sKv]. Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Marijuana use is common among patients on long-term opioid therapy (LTOT) for chronic pain, but there is a lack of evidence to guide clinicians' response.

Objective

To generate expert consensus about responding to marijuana use among patients on LTOT.

Design

Analysis from an online Delphi study.

Setting/Subjects

Clinician experts in pain and opioid management across the United States.

Methods

Participants generated management strategies in response to marijuana use without distinction between medical and nonmedical use, then rated the importance of each management strategy from 1 (not at all important) to 9 (extremely important). A priori rules for consensus were established, and disagreement was explored using cases. Thematic analysis of free-text responses examined factors that influenced participants' decision-making.

Results

Of 42 participants, 64% were internal medicine physicians. There was consensus that it is not important to taper opioids as an initial response to marijuana use. There was disagreement about the importance of tapering opioids if there is a pattern of repeated marijuana use without clinical suspicion for a cannabis use disorder (CUD) and consensus that tapering is of uncertain importance if there is suspicion for CUD. Three themes influenced experts' perceptions of the importance of tapering: 1) benefits and harms of marijuana for the individual patient, 2) a spectrum of belief about the overall riskiness of marijuana use, and 3) variable state laws or practice policies.

Conclusions

Experts disagree and are uncertain about the importance of opioid tapering for patients with marijuana use. Experts were influenced by patient factors, provider beliefs, and marijuana policy, highlighting the need for further research.

### Associations between naloxone prescribing and opioid overdose among patients with acute and chronic pain conditions [^112diqJE]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and Implications

This study addresses the limited knowledge of opioid overdose among pain patients prescribed opioids and naloxone in clinical contexts. By showing there is a significant association between naloxone prescription and subsequent opioid overdose, these findings indicate prescribers correctly identify pain patients most in need of naloxone. The increased risk for overdose among acute and chronic pain patients also suggests that clinical settings may need to integrate harm reduction services, such as peer support and evidence‐based approaches to safer substance use and overdose education, into their practices. Coordination with harm reduction programs that have long track records of successfully reducing risky substance use may be a key strategy for integrating such services into clinics and hospitals treating chronic and acute pain patients. Such programs may offer harm reduction training for clinical staff, and facilities may direct staff to refer patients to these community services. The findings of this research should be interpreted as an opportunity to increase targeted harm reduction support services among acute and chronic pain patients who are prescribed opioids and naloxone instead of a call for cessation of naloxone distribution. Future research may evaluate how such institutional policies and protocols linking chronic and acute pain patients at risk of overdose to additional harm reduction resources may affect substance use and overdose outcomes.

### Clinical practice guidelines for cannabis and cannabinoid-based medicines in the management of chronic pain and Co-occurring conditions [^116M1Bxh]. Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioids for pain, more specifically with respect to non-opioid therapies, CCP-CEG 2023 guidelines recommend to offer cannabinoid-based medicines as an adjunct treatment in patients taking moderate/high doses of opioids (> 50 morphine equivalent) for the management of chronic pain and/or to increase opioid sparing.

### Approach to the pharmacological management of chronic pain in patients with an alcohol use disorder [^115CoXL5]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

CNCP is a major problem in society, affecting 25% of the general population. The prevalence of chronic pain is estimated to be higher among patients with substance use disorders than among the general population. The approach to management of CNCP in a patient with a comorbid alcohol use disorder requires careful consideration of risks and benefits of analgesic and adjunctive options for pain, such as acetaminophen, NSAIDs, opioids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and cannabinoids. The patient with comorbid alcohol use disorder and chronic pain needs his/her alcohol disorder diagnosed and treated in an integrated way with the treatment of the pain. Considerations about selection of treatment for the pain must depend on treatment strategy and the success of the treatment strategy for the alcohol use disorder.

Acetaminophen may be a reasonable option short-term; however, risks of long-term use of acetaminophen in patients who continue to abuse alcohol remain unquantified. Risks associated with NSAID use generally outweigh potential benefits in patients with an alcohol use disorder. If NSAID therapy is chosen, the lowest effective dose is recommended and proton-pump inhibitor therapy should be considered in patients at increased risk of GI bleeds. Alcohol increases the risk of overdose and CNS depressant effects of opioids through pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic mechanisms. There is risk of opioid misuse in patients with a history of a substance use disorder. For chronic neuropathic pain, gabapentinoids or SNRIs are alternatives to consider. Pregabalin has demonstrated benefits in preliminary clinical trials for reducing cravings, prolonging time to heavy drinking after withdrawal, and promotion of abstinence.SNRIs and TCAs are first line for treating neuropathic pain; however, their use is limited by adverse effects and drug interactions. Cannabinoids should generally be avoided due to their potential for worsening alcohol dependence and CNS depressant effects.

### Medical cannabis: a review from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience [^1174XEE5]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Cannabinoids have recently gained a renewed interest due to their potential applicability to various medical conditions, specifically the management of chronic pain conditions. Unlike many other medications, medical cannabis is not associated with serious adverse events, and no overdose deaths have been reported. However, both safety and efficacy data for medical cannabis treatment of chronic, nonmalignant pain conditions are lacking. Therefore, representatives from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience summarize the evidence, according to level and grade, for medical cannabis treatment of several different pain conditions. Treatment of cancer-related pain has prospective evidentiary support for the use of medical cannabis. Although 3 large and well-designed randomized controlled trials investigated cannabis treatment of cancer-related pain, the evidence yielded only a grade D recommendation. Neuropathic pain has been investigated in prospective studies, but a lack of high-quality evidence renders cannabis treatment for this indication a grade C recommendation. Both safety and efficacy data are lacking for use of medical cannabis to treat chronic nonmalignant pain conditions.

### Distribution of naloxone for overdose prevention to chronic pain patients [^115doxPS]. Preventive Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In this commentary, we reflect on the growing opioid overdose epidemic and propose that chronic pain patients prescribed opioids are contributing to growing mortality rates. We advocate for expanding naloxone access and overdose prevention training, which has historically been directed when available to injection drug users, to chronic pain patients who may be at high risk for accidental opioid overdose.

### Assessment of medical cannabis and health-related quality of life [^114Zpu8w]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Pain severity was also significantly reduced in 274 patients with chronic pain when assessed 6 months after treatment, as was pain interference and most social and emotional disability scores on the S-TOPS. An analysis of 190 patients with chronic pain in the UK Medical Cannabis Registry likewise revealed improvements on a range of scales (including the EQ-5D, Sleep Quality Scale, General Anxiety Disorder-7) at 1, 3, and 6 months relative to baseline. Changes in EQ-5D scores after 6 weeks of treatment were less consistent in a study involving 214 Canadian patients commencing medical cannabis treatment; improvements were seen for patients with anxiety and PTSD, but not for patients with arthritis and other rheumatic disorders or sleep disorders. Despite an improvement in quality of life among patients with anxiety, there were no significant changes in the anxiety subscale of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale. These data suggest that treatment with medical cannabis may, in some circumstances, improve quality of life without reducing the severity of the underlying condition.

A recent study by Aviram et alprovides some evidence to support this notion. In a sample of 429 patients who consumed medical cannabis via inflorescence inhalation and were followed up monthly over 6 months, there was no change over time in the least, average, and worst weekly pain intensities, or in pain frequency. There was, however, an increase in the proportion of patients reporting better quality of life on the EQ-5D and a decrease in the proportion reporting consumption of analgesic medications at subsequent time points. There was also a reduction in the mean (SD) morphine equivalent dose of opioid analgesics from 21 (91) mg at baseline to 5.2 (27) mg at 6 months, suggesting a possible opioid-sparing association with medical cannabis, consistent with several other recent studies. These data are also supported by epidemiological evidence for reduced state-level opioid overdose mortality rates in US states with medical cannabis laws, although as Noori et alcaution in a recent review, extant evidence from randomized and observational studies is of very low certainty.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^116yg7gA]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

For this update to the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline, CDC funded AHRQ in 2018 and 2019 to conduct five systematic reviews. AHRQ's Evidence-based Practice Centers completed these reviews, which included new evidence related to the treatment of chronic and acute pain. The AHRQ review of opioids for chronic pain updated and expanded the evidence for the 2016 CDC review; studies were included on short-term (1 to < 6 months), intermediate-term (6 to < 12 months) and long-term (≥ 12 months) outcomes of therapy involving opioids, effects of opioid plus nonopioid combination therapy, effects of tramadol, effects of naloxone coprescription, risks of coprescribed benzodiazepines, risks of coprescribed gabapentinoids, and effects of concurrent use of cannabis. The systematic clinical evidence review on opioids for chronic pain also included contextual questions on clinician and patient values and preferences, costs and cost-effectiveness of opioid therapy, and risk mitigation strategies. CDC considered four new complementary AHRQ reviews on the benefits and harms of nonpharmacologic treatments for chronic pain, nonopioid pharmacologic treatments for chronic pain, treatments for acute episodic migraine, and treatments for acute (nonmigraine) pain. A question on management of acute pain in the systematic clinical evidence review for the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline was included in the new review on therapies for acute pain. CDC also reviewed AHRQ-sponsored surveillance reports conducted in follow-up to the five systematic reviews for any new evidence that could potentially change systematic review conclusions. To supplement the clinical evidence reviews, CDC sponsored a contextual evidence review on clinician and patient values and preferences and resource allocation (costs) for the areas addressed in the four new reviews.

AHRQ Method for Evaluating Quality of Evidence

The reviews used the AHRQ approach to synthesize and grade the strength of evidence. The AHRQ approach is based on a systematic review of the evidence and provides an overall strength of evidence indicating the level of certainty (high, moderate, low, or insufficient); similar factors are considered in the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) adapted Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) method. These factors include study limitations and risk for bias, consistency, directness, precision, and reporting bias. Large strength of association, dose response, and plausible confounders can strengthen observed findings. The primary clinical questions, detailed methods, and findings for the systematic and contextual evidence reviews are presented (Appendix).

### Does medical cannabis use increase or decrease the use of opioid analgesics and other prescription drugs? [^114P76C7]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

In observational and retrospective studies, people who use cannabis are more likely than people who do not use cannabis to also use other drugs. People who take medical cannabis are also more likely to report medical and non-medical use of opioid analgesics, stimulants, and tranquilizers. Given that people who take medical cannabis and those who do not are likely to have different underlying morbidity, it is possible that medical cannabis use reduces prescription drug use yet prescription drug use remains relatively high. Studies comparing people who take medical cannabis with people who do not take it cannot draw conclusions about the effect of medical cannabis on drug use. To fully understand the effect of medical cannabis on the use of other drugs, prospective longitudinal studies randomizing individuals to cannabis versus other treatments are urgently needed.

### Opioid and healthcare service use in medical cannabis patients with chronic pain: a prospective study [^117D6Tab]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2023). High credibility.

Background

Various jurisdictions have legalised medical cannabis (MC) for use in chronic pain treatment. The objective of this study was to determine if the use of MC is related to a reduction in the use of prescription opioids and other prescription medications and healthcare services.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the medical files of 68 Israeli patients with chronic pain using MC. Number of prescription medications filled and healthcare services used were recorded separately for the baseline period (6 months prior to the start of MC treatment) and 6 months' follow-up. Paired t-tests were used to compare each individual to himself/herself from baseline to follow-up.

Results

Patients filled less opioid prescription medication at follow-up compared with baseline, and the reduction was of small effect size. There were no significant changes in the use of other medications or use of healthcare services from pre-MC treatment to follow-up.

Conclusions

MC may be related to a significant yet small reduction in opioid prescription medication. Further prospective studies with representative samples are warranted to confirm the potential small opioid-sparing effects of MC treatment, its clinical importance, if any, and potential lack of association with other healthcare-related services and medication use. Due to methodological limitations of the data used in this study, results may be regarded as preliminary and causal inferences cannot be made.

### Effect of cannabis use in people with chronic non-cancer pain prescribed opioids: findings from a 4-year prospective cohort study [^1132nqZz]. The Lancet: Public Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Interest in the use of cannabis and cannabinoids to treat chronic non-cancer pain is increasing, because of their potential to reduce opioid dose requirements. We aimed to investigate cannabis use in people living with chronic non-cancer pain who had been prescribed opioids, including their reasons for use and perceived effectiveness of cannabis; associations between amount of cannabis use and pain, mental health, and opioid use; the effect of cannabis use on pain severity and interference over time; and potential opioid-sparing effects of cannabis.

Methods

The Pain and Opioids IN Treatment study is a prospective, national, observational cohort of people with chronic non-cancer pain prescribed opioids. Participants were recruited through community pharmacies across Australia, completed baseline interviews, and were followed up with phone interviews or self-complete questionnaires yearly for 4 years. Recruitment took place from August 13, 2012, to April 8, 2014. Participants were asked about lifetime and past year chronic pain conditions, duration of chronic non-cancer pain, pain self-efficacy, whether pain was neuropathic, lifetime and past 12-month cannabis use, number of days cannabis was used in the past month, and current depression and generalised anxiety disorder. We also estimated daily oral morphine equivalent doses of opioids. We used logistic regression to investigate cross-sectional associations with frequency of cannabis use, and lagged mixed-effects models to examine temporal associations between cannabis use and outcomes.

Findings

1514 participants completed the baseline interview and were included in the study from Aug 20, 2012, to April 14, 2014. Cannabis use was common, and by 4-year follow-up, 295 (24%) participants had used cannabis for pain. Interest in using cannabis for pain increased from 364 (33%) participants (at baseline) to 723 (60%) participants (at 4 years). At 4-year follow-up, compared with people with no cannabis use, we found that participants who used cannabis had a greater pain severity score (risk ratio 1.14, 95% CI 1.01–1.29, for less frequent cannabis use; and 1.17, 1.03–1.32, for daily or near-daily cannabis use), greater pain interference score (1.21, 1.09–1.35; and 1.14, 1.03–1.26), lower pain self-efficacy scores (0.97, 0.96–1.00; and 0.98, 0.96–1.00), and greater generalised anxiety disorder severity scores (1.07, 1.03–1.12; and 1.10, 1.06–1.15). We found no evidence of a temporal relationship between cannabis use and pain severity or pain interference, and no evidence that cannabis use reduced prescribed opioid use or increased rates of opioid discontinuation.

Interpretation

Cannabis use was common in people with chronic non-cancer pain who had been prescribed opioids, but we found no evidence that cannabis use improved patient outcomes. People who used cannabis had greater pain and lower self-efficacy in managing pain, and there was no evidence that cannabis use reduced pain severity or interference or exerted an opioid-sparing effect. As cannabis use for medicinal purposes increases globally, it is important that large well designed clinical trials, which include people with complex comorbidities, are conducted to determine the efficacy of cannabis for chronic non-cancer pain.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^1139JrLM]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

ASIPP adherence monitoring emphasizes evidence, regulations, and responses to abnormal tests. As described, adherence monitoring is not only based on evidence, but also upon regulation(s) and recommendations and incorporates patient assessment, risk stratification, and urinary drug testing. Lack of adherence, aberrant behavior, and/or abnormal drug testing will necessitate that the patient may be tapered off the medication and ultimately discharged from the services, unless they are willing to go through a treatment program. Once an abnormality is identified, the patient is provided with a single chance for illicit drugs and two chances for THC prior to initiating tapering process with monthly drug testing.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the prescribing of opioids for adult patients in the emergency department [^114ChcUN]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Opioid-related risk in chronic noncancer pain patients — screening and outcomes data note substantial overdose and misuse metrics and limited emergency department (ED) validation of risk tools, as a retrospective analysis of 295 unintentional prescription overdose deaths found that 93% were due to opioids, 63% represented pharmaceutical drug diversion, 21% had engaged in doctor shopping, and 95% had a history of substance abuse, while 2 general studies have shown a correlation between high daily opioid dose and overdose death; additional observational work reported that higher Pain Medication Questionnaire scores were associated with a substance abuse problem or early refill requests and that a 1-year follow-up found chronic opioid treatment may put patients at risk for chronic depression, and tools such as the Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain (SOAPP), Opioid Risk Tool (ORT), and Diagnosis, Intractability, Risk, and Efficacy (DIRE) have yet to be fully validated in the ED in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and utility.

### Are prescription opioids driving the opioid crisis? Assumptions vs facts [^111r6Q1F]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Other Factors Related to Opioid Analgesic Prescribing Safety

Medical cannabis laws were examined for potential impact on fatal opioid analgesic OD during 1999 to 2010. Compared with states without medical cannabis laws, states that enacted medical cannabis laws before 2011 (N = 13) showed a mean 24.8% reduction in annual opioid analgesic OD fatalities. The relationship between access to medical cannabis (vs states without access) and reductions in opioid analgesic OD deaths was evident one year after the passage of medical cannabis laws, and it strengthened over time: year 1 (–19.9%), year 2 (–25.2%), year 3 (–23.6%), year 4 (–20.2%), year 5 (–33.7%), and year 6 (–33.3%). Reductions in opioid analgesic deaths in states with (vs without) medical cannabis access were statistically significant for each year (range = P < 0.001 to P = 0.02). The association between medical cannabis laws and opioid analgesic deaths remained after including all heroin OD deaths, even when opioid analgesics were not present. In states with medical cannabis laws, there was no relationship between opioid analgesic OD deaths two years before passage and one year before passage.

Liberalized opioid analgesic prescribing in some European countries has not led to the addiction and overdose rates seen in the United States. This disparity was thought to reflect the contribution of uniquely American factors beyond opioid analgesic exposure that include preferential insurance coverage for drug over nondrug chronic pain therapies and aggressive pharmaceutical industry marketing of ER opioids. For example, of 870,000 German health insurance enrollees in 2012, the one-year prevalence of prescribed opioid analgesic problems (fatal overdose, ED visits, OUD diagnosis) was 0.008%.

### Impact of opioid dose reduction on individuals with chronic pain: results of an online survey [^116VMDpU]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic pain affects more than 100 million Americans and can be debilitating, causing marked impairment in health status, quality of life, work, personal relationships, mental health, and daily activities.–Opioid analgesics are a common treatment option for people with chronic pain. Although no data are available specifically for chronic pain, the annual opioid prescribing rate in the United States was 66.5 prescriptions per 100 persons in 2016. Responsible opioid prescribing dictates that providers evaluate both the expected benefits (eg, optimal pain control and function) and risks (eg, adverse events, potential for misuse/abuse) of long-term use. Currently, the United States is experiencing an opioid overdose epidemic. In 2016, more than 42,000 overdose deaths were associated with opioids, including natural (eg, morphine) and semisynthetic (eg, oxycodone, hydrocodone) prescription opioids, synthetic opioids (eg, fentanyl; primarily illicitly produced), and heroin. Consequently, attention has increasingly focused on the risks rather than on the potential benefits of chronic opioid therapy. However, in light of the prevalence and burden of chronic pain, it is important that these treatments remain available to patients.

### Medical cannabis authorization and opioid milligram equivalents over time in patients with chronic pain: a retrospective analysis [^116Aa2aV]. Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Strategies are needed for patients with chronic pain who are using opioids to safely and effectively wean opioids without worsening of pain. The objective was to measure associations between medical cannabis authorization and opioid milligram equivalents in patients with chronic non-cancer pain.

Design

A longitudinal, retrospective cohort analysis from July 2016-August 2019.

Setting

Electronic health record data were analyzed.

Subjects

Adult patients (≥ 18years) seen in a university-based pain clinic.

Methods

Longitudinal multilevel modeling with maximum likelihood estimation.

Results

Average overall opioid milligram equivalent at the final time point was 33.4mg/day (SE = 1.18) with increase over time, of 0.45mg/day per quarter (not statistically significant). Average OME in those without medical cannabis authorization was 32.60mg/day (SE = 1.11); vs. 38.51mg/day (SE = 4.81) in those with medical cannabis authorization, not significantly different. Medical cannabis consultation predicted a non-significant decrease of 14.25mg/day opioid milligram equivalent. Long term opioid use was a significant predictor with a mean opioid milligram equivalent of 85.34mg/day, 63mg/day higher than the rest of the cohort at the final quarter (t = 5.77, SE = 10.93, p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

In this longitudinal study of electronic health record data, medical cannabis authorization was not associated with a statistically significant decrease in opioid milligram equivalent over time. However, patients with long-term opioid use diagnostic code demonstrated a significantly higher endpoint opioid milligram equivalent. Future prospective research is needed to establish whether there are opioid-sparing effects of cannabis in humans.

### Opioid overdose: risk assessment and mitigation in outpatient treatment [^113vtzWf]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The present clinical case discussion focuses on a patient with comorbid substance use disorder (SUD) and chronic pain, who experienced an overdose of heroin.

### Marijuana correlates with use of other illicit drugs in a pain patient population [^114jtBfk]. Pain Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Background

A significant number of chronic pain patients may use marijuana. Physicians treating those patients can benefit by knowing whether their patients using marijuana are at higher risk for using other illicit drugs such as cocaine and/or methamphetamine.

Objective

Our objective was to determine whether marijuana-using chronic pain patients have a higher incidence of cocaine and/or methamphetamine use.

Study Design

A retrospective study of the incidence of pain patients using marijuana and/or other illicit drugs such as methamphetamine and cocaine versus the incidence of pain patients not using marijuana but using methamphetamine and/or cocaine.

Methods

Urine specimens from chronic pain patients were analyzed by LC-MS/MS to determine the co-occurrence of these abused substances.

Results

In this study 21,746 urine specimens were obtained from chronic pain patients. We found a 13.0% incidence of patients positive for the acid form of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THCA). The percentage of those positive for cocaine was 4.6%, those positive for methamphetamine totaled 1.07%. Using both chi-square and a Logistic Regression analysis, we determined that there was a correlation between marijuana use and the use of other illicit drugs. The odds ratio was > 3.7 for other illicit drug use.

Limitations

The study is limited in that we obtained no data as to the causal relationships of this type of drug use.

Conclusions

Pain physicians should be aware that this relationship exists and marijuana-using patients are at greater risk for use of other illicit drugs although no causal relationship is implied. Increased monitoring of these patients may help minimize potential morbidity due to drug interactions as well as identify patients who may be diverting prescriptions in order to pay for illicit drugs.

### Cannabis legalization and opioid use disorder in veterans health administration patients [^1173Xoct]. JAMA Health Forum (2025). High credibility.

Our findings were consistent with 3 national studies that showed that MCL was not associated with a reduced prevalence of OUD, with adults 50 years or older demonstrating the greatest increase in OUD following MCL enactment. Some ecological studies have suggested that cannabis legalization is associated with reductions in opioid use, a necessary although not sufficient condition for the development of OUD. However, a study of national clinical data found no MCL-related reductions in opioid use among patients with chronic pain. In our study, VHA patients with chronic pain (> 50% of patients)demonstrated increased OUD following MCL enactment. While medical cannabis has been authorized for chronic pain, evidence for its efficacy as a pain treatment remains inconclusive. Therefore, adults unable to manage their chronic pain with cannabis may transition to use of prescribed or nonprescribed opioids or augment the effects of opioids with cannabis, putting them at risk for OUD. Older adults are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of cannabis due to their lower substance use tolerance, increasing their risk of developing OUD if cannabis serves as a gateway to opioid use. This could be especially salient among older VHA patients, who may not have used cannabis during their earlier adult years when federal and military policy prohibited use, but whose willingness to use cannabis may have increased with exposure to marketing for cannabis as a medical treatment.

### ASRA pain medicine consensus guidelines on the management of the perioperative patient on cannabis and cannabinoids [^115LddFN]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2023). High credibility.

ASRA Pain Medicine consensus — concomitant cannabis and opioid use preoperatively states that chronic use of THC may worsen postoperative pain, increase postoperative opioid use and precipitate the development of postoperative hyperalgesia (Level of certainty: Moderate). It further notes there is a lack of high-quality evidence describing the effects of concomitant opioids and cannabinoids in the perioperative period and that the overall benefit of preoperative cannabinoid tapering is uncertain (Level of certainty: Low). The recommendations specify, "We recommend that the frequent cannabis user be counseled on the potentially negative effects on postoperative pain control", and, "We cannot recommend for or against the routine tapering of cannabis and cannabinoids in the perioperative period" (Grade I).

### Problematic use of prescription opioids and medicinal cannabis among patients suffering from chronic pain [^112dBkyM]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess prevalence rates and correlates of problematic use of prescription opioids and medicinal cannabis (MC) among patients receiving treatment for chronic pain.

Design

Cross-sectional study.

Setting

Two leading pain clinics in Israel.

Subjects

Our sample included 888 individuals receiving treatment for chronic pain, of whom 99.4% received treatment with prescription opioids or MC.

Methods

Problematic use of prescription opioids and MC was assessed using DSM-IV criteria, Portenoy's Criteria (PC), and the Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM) questionnaire. Additional sociodemographic and clinical correlates of problematic use were also assessed.

Results

Among individuals treated with prescription opioids, prevalence of problematic use of opioids according to DSM-IV, PC, and COMM was 52.6%, 17.1%, and 28.7%, respectively. Among those treated with MC, prevalence of problematic use of cannabis according to DSM-IV and PC was 21.2% and 10.6%, respectively. Problematic use of opioids and cannabis was more common in individuals using medications for longer periods of time, reporting higher levels of depression and anxiety, and using alcohol or drugs. Problematic use of opioids was associated with higher self-reported levels of pain, and problematic use of cannabis was more common among individuals using larger amounts of MC.

Conclusions

Problematic use of opioids is common among chronic pain patients treated with prescription opioids and is more prevalent than problematic use of cannabis among those receiving MC. Pain patients should be screened for risk factors for problematic use before initiating long-term treatment for pain-control.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^113ybRL7]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

ASIPP guidelines — Risk mitigation for opioid diversion, overdose, and addiction in chronic pain care states that these risks are present to some degree with all opioids and with all pain diagnoses, and that no single or simple change in prescribing behavior can be expected to alleviate all risks while properly managing pain. The following approaches can help mitigate all risks, including limiting the prescribed opioid to the lowest effective dose for the shortest effective duration, following recommended screening for addiction with all patients, using the PDMP and monitoring for diversion which is described as critical, and that all prescribers of opioids for pain management should expand the use of naloxone to prevent overdoses. It also notes that most patients with chronic non-cancer pain do not have the disease of addiction.

### Preadmission cannabis use is positively correlated with inpatient opioid dose exposure in hospitalized patients with inflammatory bowel diseases [^114ss16v]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Opioid use is associated with excess mortality in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Recent data have highlighted that inpatient opioid exposure is associated with postdischarge opioid use in this population. It is unknown if preadmission use of cannabis, which is commonly used for symptom relief among patients with IBD, increases the risk for inpatient opioid exposure when patients lack access to cannabis for symptom management. We sought to determine the association between preadmission cannabis use and inpatient opioid exposure while adjusting for relevant confounders.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult patients hospitalized for IBD within a large academic health system from March 1, 2017, to April 10, 2018. Opioid exposure was calculated by converting the sum of administered opioid doses to intravenous morphine milligram equivalents and dividing by length of stay. We used multivariable linear regression to assess the association between cannabis use and inpatient opioid exposure while adjusting for confounders including IBD severity and preadmission opioid use.

Results

Our study included 423 IBD patients. Linear regression analysis showed a significant positive correlation between inpatient opioid exposure (intravenous morphine milligram equivalents divided by length of stay) and preadmission cannabis use (coefficient = 12.1; 95% confidence interval, 2.6–21.5). Other significantly associated variables were first patient-reported pain score (coefficient = 1.3; 95% CI, 0.6–2.0) and preadmission opioid use (coefficient = 22.3; 95% CI, 17.0–27.6).

Conclusions

Cannabis use is positively correlated with inpatient opioid exposure after controlling for confounders. A personalized pain management approach should be considered to limit inpatient and possibly future opioid exposure among hospitalized patients with IBD who use cannabis.

Chronic pain — serious adverse events (AEs) and overdose risk with opioids: Consistently, the use of opioids for six months or less did not show evidence of serious AEs but did show a level of harm when measuring AEs, and across SRs/meta-analyses serious AEs did not differ between opioid and placebo groups at limited follow-up periods of four and 12 weeks in patients with non-cancer neuropathic pain, at four and 15 weeks in patients with low back pain, and at four and 24 weeks in patients with OA; however, one study suggests serious AEs occurred more often with tramadol than with placebo at one and 12 week follow-ups among patients with OA. Observational data indicate risk over longer horizons, as three retrospective studies found that higher doses of opioids resulted in increased risk of fatal overdoses, both intentional and unintentional, and analysis over an extended period provides insight on serious AEs for long-term opioid use for more than six months.

### Opioid overdose history, risk behaviors, and knowledge in patients taking prescribed opioids for chronic pain [^111mfNQw]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

More than 100 million adults in the United States experience chronic pain, and prescription opioids are the third most widely prescribed class of medications. Current opioid overdose prevention efforts almost exclusively target illicit opioid users, and little is known about the experience of overdose among patients being treated for chronic pain (CP) with a prescription opioid.

Methods

Patients experiencing CP forthree or more months and receiving a prescription opioid for pain management (N = 502) completed a self-report survey that asked questions about opioid overdose history, past 30-day risk factors, and knowledge of opioid overdose, overdose risk, and naloxone.

Results

Approximately one in five CP participants reported experiencing a lifetime overdose. CP participants reported engaging in several behaviors associated with overdose risk and were unlikely to have been trained to administer naloxone. Fewer than 50% of participants answered any knowledge item correctly. The likelihood of having experienced an overdose increased as the scores on the SOAPP-R and DSM-5 opioid use disorder checklist increased, and a SOAPP-R scoreof 7 or higher or meeting DSM-5 mild opioid use disorder criteria were significantly associated with reporting a lifetime overdose (85% and 84% of participants who experienced an overdose, respectively).

Conclusions

Opioid overdose occurs at a high rate among CP participants, and this group is relatively uninformed about risk factors for overdose. Established SOAPP-R and DSM thresholds provide an opportunity to identify participants at elevated risk for having experienced an opioid overdose. These data support development of additional concentrated efforts to prevent overdose among chronic pain patients.

### Medical cannabis laws and opioid analgesic overdose mortality in the United States, 1999–2010 [^115fVqt8]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Opioid analgesic overdose mortality continues to rise in the United States, driven by increases in prescribing for chronic pain. Because chronic pain is a major indication for medical cannabis, laws that establish access to medical cannabis may change overdose mortality related to opioid analgesics in states that have enacted them.

Objective

To determine the association between the presence of state medical cannabis laws and opioid analgesic overdose mortality.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A time-series analysis was conducted of medical cannabis laws and state-level death certificate data in the United States from 1999 to 2010; all 50 states were included.

Exposures

Presence of a law establishing a medical cannabis program in the state.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Age-adjusted opioid analgesic overdose death rate per 100 000 population in each state. Regression models were developed including state and year fixed effects, the presence of 3 different policies regarding opioid analgesics, and the state-specific unemployment rate.

Results

Three states (California, Oregon, and Washington) had medical cannabis laws effective prior to 1999. Ten states (Alaska, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Rhode Island, and Vermont) enacted medical cannabis laws between 1999 and 2010. States with medical cannabis laws had a 24.8% lower mean annual opioid overdose mortality rate (95% CI, -37.5% to -9.5%; p = 0.003) compared with states without medical cannabis laws. Examination of the association between medical cannabis laws and opioid analgesic overdose mortality in each year after implementation of the law showed that such laws were associated with a lower rate of overdose mortality that generally strengthened over time: year 1 (-19.9%; 95% CI, -30.6% to -7.7%; p = 0.002), year 2 (-25.2%; 95% CI, -40.6% to -5.9%; p = 0.01), year 3 (-23.6%; 95% CI, -41.1% to -1.0%; p = 0.04), year 4 (-20.2%; 95% CI, -33.6% to -4.0%; p = 0.02), year 5 (-33.7%; 95% CI, -50.9% to -10.4%; p = 0.008), and year 6 (-33.3%; 95% CI, -44.7% to -19.6%; P < .001). In secondary analyses, the findings remained similar.

Conclusions and Relevance

Medical cannabis laws are associated with significantly lower state-level opioid overdose mortality rates. Further investigation is required to determine how medical cannabis laws may interact with policies aimed at preventing opioid analgesic overdose.

Among the lowest MME stratum (Figure 2 A), mean (SD) daily MME at the end of the intervention period for the exposure group was 16.0 (22.2), a 48% reduction from 30.7 MME at the baseline, compared with 30.0 (25.4) for the nonexposure group, a 4% reduction from a baseline MME of 31.4. The adjusted analyses found the exposure group had a larger monthly MME reduction compared with the nonexposure group, with a difference of −1.52 (95% CI, −1.67 to −1.37) MME (Table 2). This resulted in a total MME net reduction of −14.53 (95% CI, −17.45 to −11.61) MME over 8 months for the exposure group compared with the MME changes in the nonexposure group.

Among patients with a baseline MME of 50 to less than 90 (Figure 2 B), the mean (SD) daily MME at the end of the intervention period was 35.4 (37.6) for the exposure group (a 47% reduction) vs 60.8 (35.7) for the nonexposure group (a 9% reduction). The adjusted analysis showed a significant difference of −3.24 (95% CI, −3.61 to −2.87) MME in monthly MME reduction between the exposure group and the nonexposure group (Table 2). After 8 months, a total MME reduction of −29.49 (95% CI, −35.94 to −23.04) MME was observed for the exposure group compared with the nonexposure group.

### Weighing the risks and benefits of chronic opioid therapy [^112gPGsn]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Evidence supports the use of opioids for treating acute pain. However, the evidence is limited for the use of chronic opioid therapy for chronic pain. Furthermore, the risks of chronic therapy are significant and may outweigh any potential benefits. When considering chronic opioid therapy, physicians should weigh the risks against any possible benefits throughout the therapy, including assessing for the risks of opioid misuse, opioid use disorder, and overdose. When initiating opioid therapy, physicians should consider buprenorphine for patients at risk of opioid misuse, opioid use disorder, and overdose. If and when opioid misuse is detected, opioids do not necessarily need to be discontinued, but misuse should be noted on the problem list and interventions should be performed to change the patient's behavior. If aberrant behavior continues, opioid use disorder should be diagnosed and treated accordingly. When patients are discontinuing opioid therapy, the dosage should be decreased slowly, especially in those who have intolerable withdrawal. It is not unreasonable for discontinuation of chronic opioid therapy to take many months. Benzodiazepines should not be coprescribed during chronic opioid therapy or when tapering, because some patients may develop cross-dependence. For patients at risk of overdose, naloxone should be offered to the patient and to others who may be in a position to witness and reverse opioid overdose.

### US trends of opioid-use disorders and associated factors among hospitalized patients with spinal conditions and treatment from 2005 to 2014 [^115nAJyj]. Spine (2020). Medium credibility.

Age, Demographic and Socioeconomic Characteristics and Assumption of Purpose of Opioid Abuse, Dependence, or Poisoning

We observed a distinct pattern in the relationship between age and opioid-use disorders. Compared to middle-aged and older adults, young adults (< 30 years' old) are the most vulnerable to opioid, and the risk of opioid-use disorders declines monotonically with progressing age. This finding supports the previous results that young adults are more likely than older adults to use opioids because young adults tend to perceive opioids as low risk, both for prescription and recreational uses. Our findings may suggest illicit use as a potential contributing factor for opioid-use disorders among young adults, although the reason for opioid use was not available in our analysis. It is interesting to see the discordance of the median household income and primary payer in opioid-use disorders. Population with private insurance has the lowest rate, whereas the group with the highest median household income has the highest percentage. It may be secondary to the shift of the insurance carrier regardless of the household income after chronic disabling painful spinal conditions with opioid abuse, dependence, or poisoning. This fact warrants further investigation as this report lacked the longitudinal socioeconomic information of the individuals.

Cannabis, Other Substances, and Mental Health Conditions as Associated Factors of Opioid-use Disorders

Cannabis legalization during the last 18 years has led to a broader spectrum of medicinal as well as recreational use. Sound production is more efficient than black market production, and falling cannabis prices have increased the accessibility of use among young adults. Although there is an ongoing debate about whether cannabis is a gateway drug, our findings imply that cannabis use and opioid use can mutually increase each other, based on the reports from surveyand claim data. Continuous use of cannabis, either medicinally or recreationally, may lead to increased dependence and higher tolerance levels. Therefore, it is possible that medical and recreational use of marijuana might lead to more detrimental health outcomes such as cannabis abuse or dependence. Because of the nature of our cross-sectional study design using the NIS dataset, we were unable to examine whether cannabis use begins before the opioid use. Also, socioeconomic status, depression, and anxiety were reported to be associated with an increased risk of persistent opioid use at 1 year following the intervention in this group. A recent study revealed about 50% of patients undergoing spinal surgery might be consuming opioids at the time of the surgical procedures, and 20% of this population may be opioid-dependent.

### Controlled substance abuse and illicit drug use in chronic pain patients: an evaluation of multiple variables [^115gf73G]. Pain Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Opioids are used extensively for chronic pain management in the United States. The frequency of opioid use prior to presenting to interventional pain management settings and in interventional pain management settings has been shown to be above 90%. Opioid abuse has been demonstrated in 9% to 41% of patients receiving chronic pain management. Illicit drug use has been reported in 14% to 34% of patients in chronic pain management settings.

Objectives

To evaluate and correlate multiple variables with opioid abuse and illicit drug use.

Design

A prospective, consecutive study.

Setting

Interventional pain management practice setting in the United States.

Methods

A total of 500 consecutive patients prescribed opioids, considered to be receiving stable doses of opioids supplemental to their interventional techniques were evaluated for opioid abuse and for illicit drug use. Abuse was defined as a patient receiving controlled substances from any source other than the prescribing physician at our center with the exception of controlled substances for acute injuries unrelated to the problem being treated, or for emergencies. Urine drug testing for illicit drugs was performed by urine rapid drug screen (Instant Technologies, iCup Norfolk, VA). Results were considered positive if one or more of the monitored illicit drugs including cocaine, marijuana (THC), phencycledane methamphetamine or amphetamines were detected.

Results

Opioid abuse was seen in 9% of patients, with illicit drug use in 16% of patients. Significant differences were noted in the prevalence of opioid abuse in patients who developed chronic pain following motor vehicle accident(s) and in patients presenting with pain in three regions of the body. Illicit drug use (marijuana) was more common in females. Illicit drug use was also more common in patients younger than 45, after motor vehicle injury, and in patients with involvement of three regions of the body.

Conclusion

Opioid abuse and illicit drug use were common in chronic pain patients with a prevalence of 9% and 16%, respectively. Age, pain after motor vehicle accident, involvement of multiple regions and past history of illicit drug use were identified as risk factors.

### Opioid prescriptions for pain and epidemic of overdose death: can the dramatic reduction in anesthesia mortality serve as an example? [^1153ZFWy]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

it is not known whether the risk for iatrogenic addiction among patients treated with opioids for acute or subacute pain is relatively high (> 10%) or low (< 0.1%).

Although the incidence of iatrogenic opioid addiction is unknown, opioid use disorders are quite prevalent among chronic pain patients. A survey on the lifetime prevalence of prescription opioid use disorder among 705 chronic non-cancer pain patients based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-5 revealed the degree of spread of abuse-related behavior – 35% of these patients met DSM-5 criteria. This indicates that reduction in the use of opioids for the treatment of chronic nonmalignant pain could profoundly reduce the number of addicted patients. The first step to counteract the epidemic should be efforts to reduce the number of new patients with chronic nonmalignant pain who are maintained on long-term opioids. Addiction has not yet developed at this point, therefore reductions should be more significant than from the treatment of addiction (usually requiring life-long efforts). The limitation of unnecessary use of opioids for the treatment of chronic pain could provide a very significant reduction of overdose opioid death rate through prevention of potentially addictive treatment.

### Opioid deprescribing in patients with noncancer pain [^1143B5SS]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on opioids for pain:

- **Definition**: Opioids are analgesic agents that modulate central pain pathways to diminish pain perception and distress. Their use in pain management is reserved for conditions where pain is severe and other therapies are inadequate. In cancer-related pain, opioids remain a cornerstone of treatment because benefits generally outweigh long-term risks. In contrast, for noncancer pain, particularly chronic musculoskeletal or neuropathic pain, opioids have limited sustained efficacy and higher potential for harm. Short-term use is appropriate for acute postoperative or traumatic pain when nonopioid measures are insufficient.
- **Pathophysiology**: Opioids reduce nociceptive transmission and alter affective responses to pain, but with continued use induce tolerance, physical dependence, and neuroadaptive changes that can enhance pain sensitivity (opioid-induced hyperalgesia). These effects, combined with respiratory depression and reward pathway activation, restrict their role in sustained pain control.
- Epidemiology: Chronic pain affects roughly 20% of adults worldwide, making it one of the most prevalent and disabling conditions. Despite declining prescribing trends, opioid use remains widespread: about 6% of adults in the US report prescription opioid use in the past month, and globally, around 16 million people are estimated to have opioid use disorder, corresponding to 155 cases per 100,000 population. Among patients with chronic noncancer pain treated with opioids, approximately 9–10% develop opioid dependence or opioid use disorder. In 2019, opioid consumption for pain reached 1,353 morphine milligram equivalents (MME) per 1,000 inhabitants per day in the United Kingdom, the highest per capita consumption globally. The risk of overdose, dependence, and mortality increases in proportion to dose and duration of exposure.
- **Disease course**: Opioids provide short-term relief for acute moderate-to-severe pain but lose efficacy with prolonged use. In chronic pain, functional improvement is often minimal, while the risk of adverse effects and dependence grows. Effective management requires reassessment within weeks of initiation, adherence to the lowest effective dose, and integration of nonopioid pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments. Discontinuation should occur gradually to prevent withdrawal and psychological distress.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Long-term outcomes depend on minimizing exposure and emphasizing multimodal care. Patients managed with a structured, function-oriented approach, including physical therapy, cognitive-behavioral interventions, and nonopioid medications, achieve better pain control and safety. Persistent opioid therapy without clear benefit increases the likelihood of morbidity, overdose, and reduced QoL.

### Opioid therapy for chronic pain in the United States: promises and perils [^111GW28q]. Pain (2013). Low credibility.

Opioid therapy offers the promise of reducing the burden of chronic pain in not just individual patients, but among the broad population of patients with chronic pain. Randomized trials have demonstrated that opioid therapy for up to 12–16weeks is superior to placebo, but have not addressed longer-term use. In the United States, opioid sales have quadrupled during 2000–2010, with parallel increases in opioid accidental overdose deaths and substance abuse admissions. Clinical use of long-term opioid therapy is characterized by a pattern of adverse selection, where high-risk patients are prescribed high-risk opioid regimens. This adverse selection may link these trends in use, abuse, and overdose. Long-term opioid therapy appears to be associated with iatrogenic harm to the patients who receive the prescriptions and to the general population. The United States has, in effect, conducted an experiment of population-wide treatment of chronic pain with long-term opioid therapy. The population-wide benefits have been hard to demonstrate, but the harms are now well demonstrated.

### Risk factors for indicators of opioid-related harms amongst people living with chronic non-cancer pain: findings from a 5-year prospective cohort study [^115dJhAA]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Additionally, our data suggest that implementing dosage thresholds as in the 2016 United States Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines will not in effect address opioid-related risk. It is possible that this emphasis on dose comes from the ability to easily measure and respond to dose thresholds, compared with the relative complexity and time considerations of assessing other clinical factors that substantially contribute to opioid-related risk. There have been unintended consequences from inflexibly applying dose thresholds in those guidelines, including the abrupt and forced tapering and cessation of opioids in people on long-term therapy, a practice that the authors of the guidelines have recently challenged.

It follows that our findings do not support 'deprescribing' of opioid medication based solely on opioid doses as an action to address problematic opioid behaviours. The current study found patient characteristics such as younger age, male, previous substance use history and mental health history are also important factors related to problematic behaviours. Given the added harms that may occur after abrupt opioid taper, including increased mortality, our study highlights the need for clinical decisions to be more nuanced and based on a holistic assessment of the needs, risks and benefits of each individual patient. Although there are valid concerns about the safety and limited evidence of efficacy for the use of opioids for CNCP, long-term opioid use may be of benefit in carefully selected and monitored patients.

The current study is to our knowledge one of the largest, longest and most comprehensive to date. There was a high rate of follow-up, with validated scales to assess both confounders and opioid outcomes, and we measured actual opioid consumption, rather than relying on administrative data from prescriptions. Our sensitivity analyses found similar results to the primary analyses, suggesting that these findings are robust to missing data.

Although data were self-reported, this method of data collection has been shown to be valid, particularly when there are no disincentives for being honest, as was the case in our study. All participants were assured of confidentiality and that the data would be de-identified.

There are some limitations. One may be the representativeness of the sample. To examine this potential bias, at baseline we collected data from a random sample of 71 pharmacies on the characteristics of all customers obtaining opioids during their six-week recruitment window. We found very strong similarities between our participants and all opioid customers, which we have previously reported. Additionally, our cohort's long history of pain and opioid treatment may mean that our findings do not generalise to patients newly initiated on opioids.

### The role of cannabis use in suicidal ideation among patients with opioid use disorder [^113YJU6A]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The life expectancy amongst Canadians did not rise between 2016 to 2017 for the first time in over 3 decades. This is despite the fact that Canadians aged 55 to 89 are living longer. Statistics Canada reports reveal that advancements in healthcare, contributing to the observed longevity of older Canadians, have been offset by the increased rate of death amongst young adults, especially men, between the ages of 20 to 44. This alarming rise was linked to the opioid crisis, and the increased rate of both accidental and intentional opioid overdose within this age group.

Cannabis use has repeatedly been shown to be associated with a heightened propensity for suicidal behavior in the general population. – In fact, studies have found that those who use cannabis are more than twice as likely to attempt suicide compared to those who do not use cannabis. – Amongst those with opioid use disorder (OUD), a population already at a heightened risk for suicidal behavior, concurrent cannabis use is reported by 11.2% to 78.6% of individuals. Given the recent legalization of cannabis in Canada, amid the opioid crisis, we are interested in exploring the association between cannabis use and suicidal ideation amongst patients with OUD. This is especially important given emerging evidence that cannabis use may serve as a harm reduction strategy in the management of OUD and opioid withdrawal, though this approach is based on conflicting findings. – Proposed mechanisms include the synergistic effect of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive component of cannabis, on amplifying the analgesic effect of opioids, and the ability of cannabinoids to increase endogenous opioid release. – We hypothesize that cannabis use would be associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in this population.

Purpose and triggers for definitive urine drug testing (UDT) clarify that "Presumptive UDT is typically requested by a clinician caring for a patient when there is a need for swift access to results that can be promptly integrated into the clinical evaluation and treatment decisions", whereas "Definitive UDT is considered justifiable and essential when the clinical context provides strong support for the need for comprehensive testing". Situations include when "There's a requirement to identify a specific substance or metabolite not adequately detected by a presumptive UDT screen", the need "to definitively pinpoint specific drugs within a broad drug category", identification of agents such as "fentanyl, meperidine, synthetic cannabinoids, and other synthetic or analog drugs" that "aren't typically detected by presumptive UDT", when "Precise drug concentrations are needed to guide patient management (e.g., discontinuing THC use as part of a treatment plan)", when "A presumptive UDT result contradicts a patient's self-report, clinical presentation, medical history, or current prescribed pain medication plan", when "There's a need to eliminate the possibility of an error as the cause of a presumptive UDT result", when "Non-prescribed medication or illicit substance use needs to be identified for the safe ongoing prescribing or other interventions", and because "Definitive UDT is essential for conducting a thorough assessment of medication effectiveness, side effects, or potential drug interactions". The decision "should be guided by patient-specific considerations", and "the clinician's rationale for ordering definitive UDT and the chosen tests must be documented in the patient's medical record".

Dual extraction and quality assessment.

Data Synthesis

No study of opioid therapy versus no opioid therapy evaluated long-term (> 1 year) outcomes related to pain, function, quality of life, opioid abuse, or addiction. Good- and fair-quality observational studies suggest that opioid therapy for chronic pain is associated with increased risk for overdose, opioid abuse, fractures, myocardial infarction, and markers of sexual dysfunction, although there are few studies for each of these outcomes; for some harms, higher doses are associated with increased risk. Evidence on the effectiveness and harms of different opioid dosing and risk mitigation strategies is limited.

Limitations

Non-English-language articles were excluded, meta-analysis could not be done, and publication bias could not be assessed. No placebo-controlled trials met inclusion criteria, evidence was lacking for many comparisons and outcomes, and observational studies were limited in their ability to address potential confounding.

Conclusion

Evidence is insufficient to determine the effectiveness of long-term opioid therapy for improving chronic pain and function. Evidence supports a dose-dependent risk for serious harms.

### The use of opioids in the management of chronic pain: synopsis of the 2022 updated U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^114SrRAG]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — opioid-related risks with substance use disorder (SUD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) in chronic pain populations are quantified across multiple studies: In a Veterans Health Administration (VHA) case cohort of 154,684 patients with chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP), SUD was associated with overdose death (HR: 2.53, 95% CI: 1.99–3.22) compared to no SUD; Liang et al. reported overdose risk with AUD or other SUD in women (OR: 5.95, 95% CI: 4.33–8.06) and men (OR 4.69, 95% CI: 3.24–6.68); Carey et al. associated measures of opioid misuse with higher risk of overall mortality, opioid overdose, and death within thirty days of overdose; among VHA patients prescribed chronic short-acting or long-acting opioids, SUD increased suicide attempts for drug use disorder with chronic short-acting (OR: 2.42, SE: 0.035) and chronic long-acting (OR: 2.83, SE: 0.057), and for AUD with chronic short-acting (OR: 1.99, SE: 0.033) and chronic long-acting (OR: 1.87, SE: 0.056); Ilgen et al. found that SUD heightens death by intentional overdose (HR 2.00, 95% CI: 1.44–2.78); AUD was linked to higher rates of opioid use disorder (OUD) in two cohorts (OR: 3.22, 95% CI: 1.79–5.80 and OR: 3.62, 95% CI: 2.59–5.06); in CNCP, lifetime SUD history was associated with therapy for opioid addiction (OR: 28.58, 95% CI: 10.86–75.27) versus no lifetime SUD history; a systematic review showed increased opioid misuse with current or previous substance use (OR: 3.55, 95% CI: 2.62–4.82) and with illicit drug use history (OR: 4.21, 95% CI: 2.31–7.65); OUD was associated with inappropriate opioid prescriptions after 12 months in Oregon Medicaid data (AOR: 2.36, 95% CI: 2.22–2.51); among U.S. patients with cancer, SUD increased opioid-related emergency department (ED) visits (OR: 3.54, 95% CI: 3.28–3.82); and alcohol use or dependence among those prescribed opioids was associated with injury risk (AOR 1.32, 95% CI: 1.02–1.71).

Perioperative cannabis and opioids — statements and recommendations: Cannabinoid studies in chronic opioid-treated patients suggest possible benefit, but the opioid-sparing effect "is not apparent in the setting of acute pain", with "Level of certainty: Low". Safety data indicate no identified increase in significant adverse events with co-administration of THC and opioids in studied settings, also with "Level of certainty: Low". For practice, "Opioids may be administered when indicated for the management of perioperative pain in patients who use cannabis with increased vigilance. Grade C". There is "insufficient evidence to recommend for or against adjusting postoperative opioid prescriptions in surgical patients who consume cannabis. Grade I".

### Changes in prescribed opioid dosages among patients receiving medical cannabis for chronic pain, New York state, 2017–2019 [^1157drRt]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Cannabis has gained popularity as a potential pain management modality. However, its role in reducing the need for prescription opioids or the dosage of opioids remains controversial due to limited research. Most studies relied on survey data or small samples of individuals who used cannabis in combination with opioids for pain management. Results showed individuals self-reported reduction in opioid use and improvement in pain management. A meta-analysis on the association of cannabinoids with reduced opioid use for analgesia found some support in observational studies but little evidence from clinical trials. Several trials used cannabis-derived products for a short time, which may not reflect how patients actually use cannabis as an alternative therapy.

Medical cannabis (MC) programs present opportunities to investigate the potential therapeutic benefits of MC for pain management and its possible adjunctive use with opioid analgesics. Most MC programs regulate the licensure, cultivation, distribution, and sale of products and require patients to be authorized or certified by a health care practitioner to participate in the program. A 2021 study of patients receiving LOT in Canada by Lee et alfound that MC authorization was associated with a significant weekly oral morphine equivalent reduction among individuals receiving high dosage of opioids (ie, oral morphine equivalent > 100). However, among individuals receiving lower dosages, a weekly increase was observed. These findings provide direct evidence for the association between MC authorization and changes in opioid dosages. However, Lee et almeasured exposure by authorization to receive MC rather than the actual receipt of MC and the length of exposure.

New York state implemented a MC programin January 2016 under the authority of the 2014 Compassionate Care Act. Chronic pain was added in regulation as a qualifying medical condition for receiving MC in March 2017. This study aims to assess the association between receiving MC for chronic pain and opioid dosage. Specifically, we examined the changes in opioid dosages among individuals receiving LOT who received MC for longer duration compared with shorter duration.

### Cannabis and chronic pain… [^113ZfC6p]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- There is limited evidence that cannabis works to treat most types of acute or chronic pain.
- More research is needed to know whether cannabis works better than other options to manage pain. Cannabis and pain Even though pain management is one of the most common reasons people report for using medical cannabis in the United States, there is limited evidence that cannabis works to treat most type of acute or chronic pain. A few studies have found that cannabis can be helpful in treating neuropathic pain. However, more research is needed to know whether cannabis works better than other options to manage pain. Opioids and Cannabis Opioids are a class of drugs used to reduce pain and include prescription opioids, heroin, and synthetic opioids. More than 106, 000 people died from drug overdoses in 2021 in the United States, and three in four of these overdose deaths involved an opioid.

Learn more about opioids and the drug overdose epidemic. Although some research suggests that states that legalize cannabis use for medical purposes experience a reduction in opioid prescribing and opioid-related deaths, other research that examines the impact of medical cannabis policies over a longer period of time indicates cannabis legalization is not associated with decreases in opioid overdose deaths and that prior research findings could be coincidental. Importantly, using cannabis either alone or in combination with opioids has been shown to increase risk for opioid misuse. There is no evidence that cannabis works to treat opioid use disorder. FDA-approved medications are available to treat opioid use disorder.

### Use of cannabis and other pain treatments in US States with medical cannabis programs… [^115NUry8]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

We assessed self-reported use of medical cannabis, pharmacologic treatments, common nonpharmacologic treatments, and substitution of cannabis in place of these treatments for chronic pain. %-34. 1%) of adults with chronic pain reported having ever used cannabis to manage their pain;
25. 9% reported using cannabis to manage their chronic pain in the past 12 months, and 23. 2% reported using cannabis in the past 30 days. Most people who reported using cannabis to manage chronic pain also reported having used either at least 1 other pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic pain treatment.

More than half of adults who used cannabis to manage their chronic pain reported that use of cannabis led them to decrease use of prescription opioid, prescription nonopioid, and over-the-counter pain medications, and less than 1% reported that use of cannabis increased their use of these medications. Fewer than half of respondents reported that cannabis use changed their use of nonpharmacologic pain treatments. Among adults with chronic pain in this study, 38. 7% reported that their used of cannabis led to decreased use of physical therapy,
19. 1% reported it led to decreased use of meditation, and 26. 0% reported it led to decreased used of cognitive behavioral therapy. Among adults with chronic pain in states with medical cannabis laws, 3 in 10 persons reported using cannabis to manage their pain.

Most persons who used cannabis as a treatment for chronic pain reported substituting cannabis in place of other pain medications including prescription opioids. The high degree of substitution of cannabis with both opioid and nonopioid treatment emphasizes the importance of research to clarify the effectiveness and potential adverse consequences of cannabis for chronic pain.
