## Question

Initial work up more mild thrombocytopenia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the initial workup for mild thrombocytopenia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true thrombocytopenia and excluding pseudothrombocytopenia. Then, I should verify the clinical context and bleeding risk to decide urgency. Next, I will review the core laboratory evaluation, including CBC with differential and peripheral smear. After that, I need to check for secondary causes with targeted testing, including viral serologies and medication review. Finally, I will consider special populations, when to escalate to bone marrow evaluation, and outline follow-up and patient education, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and exclude pseudothrombocytopenia, because platelet clumping in EDTA can artifactually lower the automated count. I should repeat the platelet count in a citrate or heparin tube and examine a peripheral smear for platelet agglutination before proceeding further, as this avoids unnecessary workup and treatment [^c9475176].

> Next, I should review the clinical context and bleeding risk to gauge urgency. Mild thrombocytopenia, typically 100–149 × 10⁹/L, is often asymptomatic, and patients with counts above 50 × 10⁹/L rarely bleed, so I need to ask about bruising, petechiae, mucosal bleeding, and recent infections, and I should confirm whether this is new or chronic by checking prior CBCs, because acute drops or concerning symptoms change the tempo of evaluation and management [^c9475176] [^90c7cfb2].

> I will now examine the core laboratory evaluation. A CBC with differential and a careful peripheral smear are essential to distinguish isolated thrombocytopenia from cytopenias or abnormal morphology. I should look for schistocytes, blasts, dysplasia, or giant platelets, and I need to ensure that other cell lines are normal before labeling this as isolated thrombocytopenia, since abnormalities beyond thrombocytopenia push me toward marrow evaluation rather than a peripheral-only workup [^c9475176] [^fbf2d2e7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology. I should systematically consider secondary causes, starting with medications, because drug-induced thrombocytopenia is common and often overlooked. I need to check for heparin exposure and apply the 4Ts score if HIT is suspected, and I should review new drugs, supplements, and alcohol use, keeping in mind that many agents can cause immune or nonimmune thrombocytopenia [^c9475176] [^f5b0b31d] [^892d71d2].

> I need to check for viral etiologies next. In adults with suspected ITP, HIV and hepatitis C serologies are recommended, and I should consider HBV, CMV, or EBV in the right clinical context, because identifying and treating these infections can improve platelet counts and alter ITP management. In children, ITP is often post-viral, so a careful infection history remains important even if serologies are not universally required [^4df5863d] [^a95d6bcb] [^aa52a5c6].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or has an autoimmune disease? In pregnancy, I should distinguish gestational thrombocytopenia from preeclampsia, HELLP, TTP/HUS, and ITP using blood pressure, liver enzymes, LDH, haptoglobin, and a smear for schistocytes, and I should remember that gestational thrombocytopenia is common, mild, and typically benign, requiring only routine prenatal monitoring unless features suggest another diagnosis [^1ac85f0c] [^fdafd89e].

> Let me consider special populations and when to escalate. In adults over 60 with isolated thrombocytopenia, the risk of hematologic malignancy is substantially elevated, so I should have a lower threshold for bone marrow evaluation even when the smear is otherwise unremarkable, as emerging data support early marrow assessment in this group to exclude MDS or other clonal disorders [^bae851ba] [^5958fcb1].

> I should double-check pediatric nuances. In children with typical features of ITP, the risk of missing leukemia is very low, and routine bone marrow aspiration is not indicated. Observation with close follow-up is appropriate for mild disease, and I need to ensure reliable follow-up and caregiver education before choosing outpatient management [^d358633d] [^d3ed68e0].

> Next, I should review when to pursue bone marrow evaluation. Indications include abnormal morphology or cytopenias beyond thrombocytopenia, suspicion for marrow failure or infiltrative disease, atypical features, or failure to respond to appropriate therapy. Otherwise, in straightforward isolated mild thrombocytopenia, marrow is generally not required at the outset [^fbf2d2e7] [^1508c449].

> I will now examine follow-up and monitoring. For stable, asymptomatic patients with confirmed isolated mild thrombocytopenia, repeating the CBC in 2–4 weeks to assess trajectory is reasonable, with earlier rechecks if symptoms develop. I should counsel on bleeding precautions, avoidance of NSAIDs, and activity modifications, and I need to ensure return precautions for bleeding, fever, or new symptoms [^c9475176].

> Hold on, I should verify that I have not missed inherited platelet disorders. If there is a family history, lifelong thrombocytopenia, or syndromic features, I should consider inherited thrombocytopenia and, when indicated, pursue molecular testing, recognizing that exome sequencing can improve diagnostic yield when phenotype-driven approaches are inconclusive [^1a1b083a] [^9ca79d3c].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure coherence. Confirm true thrombocytopenia and exclude pseudothrombocytopenia, assess bleeding risk and chronicity, obtain CBC with differential and smear, screen for secondary causes including medications and viral infections, tailor evaluation to special populations such as pregnancy, older adults, and children, and reserve bone marrow for atypical or high-risk scenarios, all while planning close follow-up and patient education [^c9475176] [^4df5863d] [^bae851ba] [^d358633d].

---

For mild thrombocytopenia (100–149 × 10⁹/L), the initial workup should be **stepwise and targeted** to confirm true thrombocytopenia, exclude pseudothrombocytopenia, and identify common causes. Start with a **history, exam, and CBC with smear** to assess bleeding, drugs, alcohol, family history, and smear abnormalities [^c9475176]. If isolated, **repeat CBC in 2–4 weeks**; if persistent, check HIV, hepatitis B/C, and consider autoimmune screening (ANA, anti-ENA) [^4df5863d] [^165bcefb]. Bone marrow biopsy is not routine unless there are atypical features, cytopenias, or suspicion of marrow disease [^4df5863d]. Most cases are benign or drug-related, and observation with follow-up is appropriate unless symptoms or counts worsen [^c9475176].

---

## Step 1: confirm true thrombocytopenia and exclude pseudothrombocytopenia

- **Repeat CBC**: Confirm the low platelet count and exclude lab error.
- **Peripheral smear**: Look for platelet clumping (pseudothrombocytopenia) [^c9475176]; if present, repeat in citrate or heparinized tubes [^c9475176].
- **History**: Ask about bleeding, bruising, mucosal bleeding, recent infections, drugs, alcohol, and family history of thrombocytopenia [^c9475176].

---

## Step 2: initial laboratory evaluation

- **CBC with differential**: Assess other lineages; isolated thrombocytopenia favors ITP or drug-induced causes [^c9475176].
- **Peripheral smear**: Evaluate platelet morphology and exclude schistocytes, blasts, or dysplasia [^c9475176].
- **Basic metabolic panel and liver function tests**: Screen for liver disease, renal dysfunction, or metabolic causes [^notfound].

---

## Step 3: targeted serological testing

If thrombocytopenia persists, **obtain targeted serologies** based on risk and context:

| **Test** | **Indication** |
|-|-|
| HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C | All adults with unexplained thrombocytopenia [^4df5863d] [^a95d6bcb] |
| ANA, anti-ENA, antiphospholipid antibodies | Suspected autoimmune disease or systemic symptoms [^notfound] |
| H. pylori | Consider in refractory or unexplained cases, especially if GI symptoms [^ab92f57d] |

---

## Step 4: additional evaluation based on clinical suspicion

- **Drug-induced thrombocytopenia**: Review medications (e.g. heparin, quinine, antibiotics, antiepileptics) and discontinue suspected agents [^c9475176].
- **Inherited thrombocytopenia**: Consider if family history or lifelong thrombocytopenia; consider genetic testing [^1a1b083a] [^9ca79d3c].
- **Bone marrow biopsy**: Reserve for atypical features, cytopenias, abnormal smear, or suspicion of marrow infiltration/failure [^fbf2d2e7] [^1508c449].

---

## Step 5: follow-up and management

- **Observation**: Most mild, isolated thrombocytopenia is benign; observe with periodic CBCs if asymptomatic [^c9475176].
- **Patient education**: Teach bleeding precautions and when to seek care [^c9475176].
- **Referral**: Consider hematology if counts fall below 100 × 10⁹/L, symptoms develop, or etiology remains unclear [^notfound].

---

## Common causes of mild thrombocytopenia

- **Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)**: Common, often idiopathic or post-viral [^c9475176].
- **Drug-induced thrombocytopenia**: Common, often reversible on withdrawal [^c9475176].
- **Viral infections**: HIV, hepatitis B/C, EBV, CMV [^4df5863d] [^aa52a5c6].
- **Liver disease**: Portal hypertension with splenomegaly [^notfound].
- **Autoimmune diseases**: SLE, antiphospholipid syndrome [^notfound].
- **Inherited thrombocytopenias**: Less common, often familial [^1a1b083a].

---

## Indications for bone marrow biopsy

Bone marrow biopsy is **not routine** in mild thrombocytopenia; consider when:

- **Abnormal smear**: Blasts, dysplasia, or abnormal morphology [^fbf2d2e7].
- **Multilineage cytopenias**: Anemia or leukopenia present [^fbf2d2e7].
- **Suspected marrow disease**: Myelodysplasia, leukemia, or infiltration [^5958fcb1].
- **Refractory cases**: Unexplained or treatment-refractory thrombocytopenia [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up recommendations

- **Stable, asymptomatic patients**: Repeat CBC in 2–4 weeks; if stable, extend intervals [^notfound].
- **Persistent thrombocytopenia**: Re-evaluate etiology and consider hematology referral [^90c7cfb2].
- **Patient education**: Reinforce bleeding precautions and symptom monitoring [^c9475176].

---

The initial workup for mild thrombocytopenia should be **focused and stepwise**: confirm true thrombocytopenia, exclude pseudothrombocytopenia, and use history, exam, CBC with smear, and targeted serologies to identify common causes. Reserve marrow evaluation for atypical or refractory cases, and manage most patients with observation and follow-up unless symptoms or counts progress [^c9475176].

### How to manage ITP with life-threatening bleeding [^e487fe37]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

While immune thrombocytopenia often presents with mild bleeding manifestations or surprising findings of thrombocytopenia on routine complete blood counts in patients without symptoms, some patients can present with new thrombocytopenia and life-threatening bleeding. Emergent assessment and treatment are needed to prevent substantial morbidity and even mortality. These patients present to the emergency room with bleeding, and hematologists are subsequently consulted. Understanding the approach to making the diagnosis and excluding other life-threatening illnesses is essential, as is rapid initiation of treatment in the bleeding patient even when the diagnosis of immune- mediated thrombocytopenia is tentative. Using a case-based format, we review how to approach and treat patients presenting with new thrombocytopenia and bleeding.

Thrombocytopenia, usually defined as a platelet count of less than 150,000/μL, is a common reason for a hematology consult in both the inpatient and outpatient setting. In most patients, the cause of the thrombocytopenia can be identified and treated. This article reviews the clinical approach to the patient with thrombocytopenia, the mechanisms that underlie it, and the laboratory tests available to investigate it. A practical approach to the investigation and management of thrombocytopenia in the clinical settings commonly encountered by the hematology consultant is then described.

### How to approach thrombocytopenia [^6950a17d]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a common hematologic finding with variable clinical expression. A low platelet count may be the initial manifestation of infections such as HIV and hepatitis C virus or it may reflect the activity of life-threatening disorders such as the thrombotic microangiopathies. A correct identification of the causes of thrombocytopenia is crucial for the appropriate management of these patients. In this review, we present a systematic evaluation of adults with thrombocytopenia. The approach is clearly different between outpatients, who are frequently asymptomatic and in whom we can sometimes indulge in sophisticated and relatively lengthy investigations, and the dramatic presentation of acute thrombocytopenia in the emergency department or in the intensive care unit, which requires immediate intervention and for which only a few diagnostic tests are available. A brief discussion of the most common etiologies seen in both settings is provided.

### Outcomes in mild to moderate isolated thrombocytopenia [^6b7b1e6d]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Incidental isolated mild to moderate thrombocytopenia is a frequent laboratory finding prompting a referral to pediatric hematology-oncology. We tested the hypothesis that patients with isolated asymptomatic mild thrombocytopenia would not progress to require an intervention from a pediatric hematologist-oncologist.

Methods

This is a 5-year retrospective review of 113 patients referred to pediatric hematology-oncology for isolated thrombocytopenia. Initial, lowest, and current platelet counts along with clinical course and need for interventions were recorded. Thrombocytopenia was categorized as mild (platelet count: 101–140 × 10 3 /μL), moderate (platelet count: 51–100 × 10 3 /μL), severe (platelet count: 21–50 × 10 3 /μL), and very severe (platelet count: ≤ 20 × 10 3 /μL).

Results

Eight of 48 patients (17%) referred for initial mild isolated thrombocytopenia progressed to moderate thrombocytopenia at 1 visit. At present, 2 of these patients have moderate thrombocytopenia, 17 remain with mild thrombocytopenia, and 29 patients have resolved thrombocytopenia. Nine of 65 patients (14%) referred for moderate thrombocytopenia progressed to severe or very severe thrombocytopenia on 1 occasion. At present, no patients have severe thrombocytopenia, 18 remain with moderate thrombocytopenia, 14 improved to mild thrombocytopenia, and 33 have resolved thrombocytopenia. Only 3 patients required interventions from a hematologist, whereas 10 patients required therapy from other subspecialties.

Conclusions

We only identified 3 patients (3%) with mild to moderate thrombocytopenia who required an intervention from a hematologist to improve platelet counts. Patients with isolated mild thrombocytopenia with a normal bleeding history and physical examination findings frequently have normalized their platelet counts within 1 month.

### Diagnostic approach to the patient with a suspected inherited platelet disorder: who and how to test [^1a1b083a]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Bleeding and thrombocytopenia are common referrals to the pediatric and adult hematology practice. The differential diagnosis encompasses a wide spectrum of entities that vary in acuity, severity, and etiology. Most will be acquired (especially in adult patients), but many can be inherited, and some may have manifestations affecting other organ systems. The first step: defining whether the symptoms and/or laboratory findings are clinically significant and warrant additional work-up, can be equally as challenging as reaching the diagnosis itself. How much bleeding is too much to be considered normal? How low of a platelet count is too low? Once the decision has been made to pursue additional studies, considering the increasing number of laboratory tests available, the diagnostic process can be complex. In this article, we outline a general approach for the evaluation of patients in whom an inherited platelet disorder is being considered. We present two clinical vignettes as introduction to the diagnostic approach to inherited platelet disorders. We describe the rationale for the different types of tests that are clinically available, their limitations, and finally the challenges that are frequently encountered in the interpretation of results. We also intend to provide some guidance on the expected phenotype in terms of severity of bleeding and/or thrombocytopenia according to the etiology of the inherited disorder. Our goal is to provide the practicing hematologist with a practical framework that is clinically applicable in their daily practice.

ASH 2019 ITP — Recommendation 1a on initial management: In adults with newly diagnosed ITP and a platelet count of < 30 × 10⁹/L who are asymptomatic or have minor mucocutaneous bleeding, the panel "suggests corticosteroids rather than management with observation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects ⊕◯◯◯)". The evidence review "included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that had internal comparators", and due to scarcity also "included all single-arm prospective studies of ≥ 50 adults with newly diagnosed ITP" and, for observation, "retrospective studies of ≥ 50 adults". No direct comparative studies were found: "We found no studies that directly compared corticosteroids vs management with observation in adult patients with ITP with a platelet count of < 30 × 10^9/L", though "We found 5 RCTs… and 2 prospective studies" of corticosteroids. Reported outcomes included "Four studies reported data on response within 7 days; 6 studies reported on remission; 3 studies reported on major bleeding; 4 studies reported on mortality; 0 studies reported on overall HRQoL", and "There were no studies in ITP patients with platelet counts of < 30 × 10^9/L who were managed with observation alone". Consequently, "The relative effects were not estimable from the data because of a lack of direct comparisons".

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 207: thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^1ac85f0c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Maternal thrombocytopenia — initial workup is outlined as follows: The differential diagnosis in pregnancy includes gestational thrombocytopenia, preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome, immune thrombocytopenia, pseudothrombocytopenia, viral infection, drug-induced thrombocytopenia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic uremic syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome, and congenital thrombocytopenias. These disorders usually can be determined with a detailed medical and family history and a physical examination, with attention to current medication use, blood pressure, splenomegaly, viral serology, and adjunctive laboratory studies as appropriate, and a complete blood count (CBC) and examination of the peripheral blood smear generally are indicated in the evaluation of maternal thrombocytopenia; a CBC helps to exclude pancytopenia, evaluation of the peripheral smear serves to rule out platelet clumping that may be a cause of pseudothrombocytopenia, and bone marrow biopsy to distinguish between inadequate platelet production and increased destruction generally is not indicated.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^ab92f57d]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) — workup and grade-based management for patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPI) therapy are as follows. Workup includes history and physical examination focused on viral illness and lymphocyte‑depleting therapies, family or personal history of autoimmunity, CBC with peripheral smear and reticulocyte count, bone marrow evaluation only if abnormalities are present or further workup is necessary, testing for HIV, HCV, HBV, and H. pylori in newly diagnosed ITP, and checking a direct antiglobin test to rule out concurrent Evans' syndrome; nutritional evaluation and bone marrow evaluation are advised if other cell lines are affected with concern for aplastic anemia. For G1 with platelet count 75 to < 100/ μL, continue ICPI with close clinical follow-up and laboratory evaluation. For G2 with platelet count 50 to < 75/ μL, hold ICPI but monitor for improvement and, if not resolved, interrupt treatment until AE has reverted to G1; administer prednisone 1 mg/kg per day (dosage range, 0.5–2 mg/kg per day) daily for 4 weeks followed by taper over 4–6 weeks to the lowest effective dose; intravenous immunoglobulin may be used with corticosteroids if a more rapid platelet rise is required.

### Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura diagnosis in children… [^d358633d]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is a relatively common pediatric disorder. It tends to follow a self-limited course, but treatment with gamma globulin or corticosteroids is often instituted to prevent bleeding complications. It has been standard practice to perform a bone marrow aspiration to rule out leukemia as part of the initial work-up of a child with an abnormally low platelet count. The reports of all bone marrow aspirations performed at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto from January 1, 1984, until May 31, 1996, were reviewed. This cohort included both inpatient and outpatient reports on bone marrow aspirations that were performed to confirm a provisional diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. The peripheral blood smear and complete blood count performed nearest to the time of the bone marrow aspiration were also reviewed to see if the patient had typical features of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.

"Typical features" included a normal hemoglobin, a normal total white blood cell and neutrophil count, and a platelet count of less than 50, 000 × 10. During the time reviewed, 7, 612 bone marrow aspirations were performed. Of these, 484 were performed to confirm a provisional diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. During the same 12-year period, 672 children were admitted to the institution with a primary diagnosis of acute idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. The study estimate indicated that 72 percent of children with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura underwent a bone marrow aspiration. Among 332 children with a platelet count of less than 50, 000 × 10. Eight additional children in the group with atypical laboratory results were found to have aplastic anemia.

The authors conclude that in children who present with thrombocytopenia and otherwise typical hematologic features of idiopathic thrombocytopenia — platelet count less than 50, 000 × 10 3 per μL with a normal hemoglobin, white blood cell count and neutrophil count — the risk of missing a diagnosis of leukemia is less than 1 percent. They also cite the significant cost of this procedure and associated morbidity, including pain, bleeding and infection.

### Adolescents and young adults with newly diagnosed primary immune thrombocytopenia [^567fafc8]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
Occurrence of bleeding symptoms at diagnosis in patients with initial profound versus moderate thrombocytopenia. Median platelet count for patients without bleeding at initial diagnosis was 37.5×10⁹/L and 11×10⁹/L for patients with some bleeding symptoms (P < 0.001).

We found only minor clinical differences between adolescents (12–18 years; 59% girls) and young adults (18–25 years; 70% women), with young adults presenting more mild-to-moderate thrombocytopenia (platelet count between 20–99×10⁹/L) at diagnosis than adolescents (47% and 32%, respectively) and less initial bleeding (70% and 85%, respectively). However, the remission rate was identical in both age groups (57%). The higher median platelet count at 6 months FU in young adults compared to adolescents (114×10⁹/L; IQR, 55–222 and 93×10⁹/L, IQR 40–197, respectively) could be the result of a higher treatment rate at this time point (58% and 42%, respectively) (Table 2). Drug treatments were reported for 66% at diagnosis, 45% after initial treatment until 6 months, and 30% at 6–12 months after diagnosis. Corticosteroids were most frequently used at all time points. Among the treated patients, 74% received corticosteroids during the first 6 months (excluding initial treatment) and 68% between 6 and 12 months. Second-line treatments were heterogeneous and administered to 28% of patients receiving treatment beyond 6 months (Table 3).

### Increased risk of haematological malignancy in adults over age 60 with thrombocytopenia compared with matched controls: time for an upfront bone marrow evaluation? [^bae851ba]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

International societies have conflicting recommendations on whether bone marrow aspirate/biopsy (BMB) is needed during workup for isolated thrombocytopenia. Our objective was to determine if thrombocytopenia in patients aged ≥ 60years is associated with an increased incidence of haematological malignancy. We performed a retrospective population-based cohort study in patients aged ≥ 60years between January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2019. Exposed patients had specialist consultation for thrombocytopenia, with platelet count < 100×10⁹/L, but normal haemoglobin and white blood cell count. Unexposed patients were those who never had specialist consultation for thrombocytopenia and whose platelets were ≥ 100×10 9 /L. The primary outcome was the diagnosis of haematological malignancy using a competing risk of death model. During 4.0years (IQR 2.2–6.7) of follow-up, 378/4930 exposed (19.1/1000PY, 95% CI 17.1–21.0), and 204/17556 unexposed patients (2.5/1000PY, 95% CI 2.2–2.8) were diagnosed with haematological malignancy (HR 15.5 (95% CI 11.3–21.4, p < 0.0001) in year 1, and 5.3 (95% CI 4.4–6.6, p < 0.0001) in years 2+). This finding persisted in analyses stratified by sex, age, severity, or duration of thrombocytopenia, and treatment with corticosteroids within 2weeks of consultation. This study found a strong association between isolated thrombocytopenia and haematological malignancy in patients ≥ 60years, supporting consideration of diagnostic testing including BMB during outpatient specialist consultation.

### Platelet disorders in children: a diagnostic approach [^b23044fa]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

The investigation of children with suspected inherited platelet disorders is challenging. The causes of mucocutaneous bleeding are many, and specialized testing for platelet disorders can be difficult to access or interpret. An algorithm developed for the investigation of suspected platelet disorders provides a sequential approach to evaluating both platelet function abnormalities and thrombocytopenia. Investigation begins with a clinical evaluation and laboratory testing that is generally available, including platelet counting, peripheral blood cell morphology, and aggregometry. Based on results of initial investigations, the algorithm recommends specialized testing for specific diagnoses, including flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy, electron microscopy, and mutational analysis.

### Thrombocytopenia [^90c7cfb2]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count of less than 150 × 10³ per µL. It is often discovered incidentally when obtaining a complete blood count during an office visit. The etiology usually is not obvious, and additional investigation is required. Patients with platelet counts greater than 50 × 10³ per µL rarely have symptoms. A platelet count from 30 to 50 × 10³ per µL rarely manifests as purpura. A count from 10 to 30 × 10³ per µL may cause bleeding with minimal trauma. A platelet count less than 5 × 10³ per µL may cause spontaneous bleeding and constitutes a hematologic emergency. Patients who present with thrombocytopenia as part of a multisystem disorder usually are ill and require urgent evaluation and treatment. These patients most likely have an acute infection, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, liver disease, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or a hematologic disorder. During pregnancy, preeclampsia and the HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) syndrome are associated with thrombocytopenia. Patients with isolated thrombocytopenia commonly have drug-induced thrombocytopenia, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, pseudothrombocytopenia, or if pregnant, gestational thrombocytopenia. A history, physical examination, and laboratory studies can differentiate patients who require immediate intervention from those who can be treated in the outpatient setting. Treatment is based on the etiology and, in some cases, treating the secondary cause results in normalization of platelet counts. Consultation with a hematologist should be considered if patients require hospitalization, if there is evidence of systemic disease, or if thrombocytopenia worsens despite initial treatment.

### Thrombocytopenia: evaluation and management [^c9475176]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a platelet count of less than 150 × 103 per μL and can occur from decreased platelet production, increased destruction, splenic sequestration, or dilution or clumping. Patients with a platelet count greater than 50 × 103 per μL are generally asymptomatic. Patients with platelet counts between 20 and 50 × 103 per μL may have mild skin manifestations such as petechiae, purpura, or ecchymosis. Patients with platelet counts of less than 10 × 103 per μL have a high risk of serious bleeding. Although thrombocytopenia is classically associated with bleeding, there are conditions in which bleeding and thrombosis can occur, such as antiphospholipid syndrome, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and thrombotic microangiopathies. Patients with isolated thrombocytopenia in the absence of systemic illness most likely have immune thrombocytopenia or drug-induced thrombocytopenia. In stable patients being evaluated as outpatients, the first step is to exclude pseudothrombocytopenia by collecting blood in a tube containing heparin or sodium citrate and repeating the platelet count. If thrombocytopenia is confirmed, the next step is to distinguish acute from chronic thrombocytopenia by obtaining or reviewing previous platelet counts. Patients with acute thrombocytopenia may require hospitalization. Common causes that require emergency hospitalization are heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, thrombotic microangiopathies, and the hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome. Common nonemergency causes of thrombocytopenia include drug-induced thrombocytopenia, immune thrombocytopenia, and hepatic disease. Transfusion of platelets is recommended when patients have active hemorrhage or when platelet counts are less than 10 × 103 per μL, in addition to treatment (when possible) of underlying causative conditions. It is important to ensure adequate platelet counts to decrease bleeding risk before invasive procedures; this may also require a platelet transfusion. Patients with platelet counts of less than 50 × 103 per μL should adhere to activity restrictions to avoid trauma-associated bleeding.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) initial evaluation and workup — The initial evaluation of AML has two objectives: to characterize the disease process based on factors such as prior toxic exposure, antecedent myelodysplasia, and karyotypic and molecular abnormalities, which may provide prognostic information that can impact responsiveness to chemotherapy, risk of relapse, and appropriateness for the use of targeted therapies; and to assess patient-specific factors, including comorbid conditions, which may affect an individual's ability to tolerate therapy, with both disease-specific and individual patient factors taken into consideration when deciding on a treatment strategy. The evaluation and initial workup for suspected AML consists of a comprehensive medical history and physical examination, and laboratory evaluations include a comprehensive metabolic panel and a complete blood count (CBC), including platelets and a differential of white blood cells (WBCs); serum uric acid and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) have prognostic relevance and should be evaluated.

### How I treat thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^19fdecd3]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

A mild thrombocytopenia is relatively frequent during pregnancy and has generally no consequences for either the mother or the fetus. Although representing no threat in the majority of patients, thrombocytopenia may result from a range of pathologic conditions requiring closer monitoring and possible therapy. Two clinical scenarios are particularly relevant for their prevalence and the issues relating to their management. The first is the presence of isolated thrombocytopenia and the differential diagnosis between primary immune thrombocytopenia and gestational thrombocytopenia. The second is thrombocytopenia associated with preeclampsia and its look-alikes and their distinction from thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and the hemolytic uremic syndrome. In this review, we describe a systematic approach to the diagnosis and treatment of these disease entities using a case presentation format. Our discussion includes the antenatal and perinatal management of both the mother and fetus.

These guidelines used different approaches to arrive at recommendations for testing and treatment. Despite differences in methodology, in both cases there was a paucity of randomized trials to inform recommendations. As data on the diagnosis and management of ITP expands, the ASH Committee on Quality is dedicated to maintaining updated guidelines representing recent evidence and guideline methodology. Here, we will review the updated ASH guidelines on ITP with a focus on recommendations with new understanding and future research to close knowledge gaps.

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^aa52a5c6]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

What if the immune thrombocytopenia is secondary to a subclinical viral infection?

Multiple viruses have been associated with ITP. In children, ITP is often thought to be a post-infectious sequela. There may also be an underlying viral disease which is asymptomatic and thus eludes detection. It remains unclear whether all patients with ITP should be screened for hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus; with the coronavirus pandemic, it might be appropriate to screen for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Treatment of these three viral infections would alter ITP management. The primary treatment for both hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus would likely increase the platelet count. However, if hepatitis C has progressed to cirrhosis, the platelet effects of antiviral treatment may be limited. Another viral infection that could be subclinical is cytomegalovirus which might be revealed only by atypical lymphocytes and/or mildly elevated liver tests. Cytomegalovirus can worsen ITP in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatments because these agents will activate the cytomegalovirus and thus worsen the ITP making it more resistant to treatment. Helicobacter pylori may "cause" ITP, but only in certain places, e.g. Japan and Italy, is searching for it at diagnosis of ITP routine and is its eradication a uniformly effective approach to ITP.

The panel recommends that collaborative cohort studies (retrospective and prospective), registries, and other observational studies addressing these issues could contribute much to improve the current levels of evidence and are likely more feasible than RCTs. These studies should apply standard dosing regimens and definitions, consistently report on patient-reported outcomes including HRQoL and side effects, and report long-term follow-up data. The panel also recommends ongoing collaborative engagement of patients to best understand how to apply these guidelines within the context of shared decision-making. Lastly, the panel recognizes that many of the management options covered in these recommendations are unavailable in certain countries; therefore global cost-effective strategies should also be assessed.

### Inherited thrombocytopenia: when a low platelet count does not mean ITP [^18dcfa77]. Blood (2004). Low credibility.

Congenital thrombocytopenias, once considered rare and obscure conditions, are today recognized with increasing frequency, especially due to the measurement of platelet number as part of routine blood testing. The clinical spectrum of congenital thrombocytopenia ranges from severe bleeding diatheses, recognized within the first few weeks of life, to mild conditions that may remain undetected even in adulthood. For the latter group of diseases, distinguishing between inherited (primary) and acquired (secondary) thrombocytopenia, especially immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), is essential to avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful treatments. In this review, the congenital thrombocytopenia syndromes are discussed with specific attention focused on diagnostic criteria, clinical presentations, genetic etiology, and current medical management. The mutated genes responsible for each syndrome are reviewed as well as the potential implications for using gene therapy or gene repair in the future.

### Perioperative thrombocytopenia: evidence, evaluation, and emerging therapies [^c1cc8799]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a common perioperative clinical problem. While global haemostasis is influenced by many patient- and procedure-related factors, the contribution of thrombocytopenia to bleeding risk is difficult to predict, as platelet count does not linearly correlate with likelihood of bleeding. Thus, the widely used definition of thrombocytopenia and grading of its severity have limited clinical utility. We present a summary and analysis of the current recommendations for invasive procedures in thrombocytopenic patients, although the platelet count at which any given procedure may safely proceed is unknown. The benefits and risks of preoperative platelet transfusions should be assessed on a patient-by-patient basis, and alternatives to platelet transfusion should be considered. In non-emergent surgeries or in postoperative thrombocytopenic patients, haematology consultation should be considered to guide diagnostics and management. We present a pragmatic approach to the evaluation of perioperative thrombocytopenia.

### Impact of baseline thrombocytopenia on early outcomes in patients with acute venous thromboembolism [^7e0c3d58]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Indeed, tailoring treatment to individual patient profiles is crucial. Factors such as the initial VTE presentation, the severity of thrombocytopenia, the presence of active cancer, or previous bleeding history should influence therapeutic decisions. This approach requires integrating a multidisciplinary team to design a treatment plan that considers all aspects of a patient's health status.

Prior studies with heterogeneous designs have largely focused on cancer‐associated thrombocytopenia, where the risk of bleeding is often deemed to overshadow the thrombotic risks, showing mixed outcomes with varied anticoagulant strategies. A recent systematic review, including 707 patients, also showed high rates of recurrent VTE and major bleeding, regardless of the management strategy (full dose anticoagulation, modified dose, or no anticoagulation). Our findings do not indicate a reduction of the risk of major bleeding with lower‐intensity anticoagulant regimens, although caution is required due to potential uncontrolled confounding factors. In any case, our study extends these previous findings by showing that even in non‐cancer patients, thrombocytopenia represents a significant independent risk factor for adverse VTE outcomes (the effect of cancer as a potential confounder was controlled in the multivariable analysis and a further sensitivity assessment limited to non‐cancer patients confirmed these findings). This aligns with research suggesting that thrombocytopenia should be a key consideration in VTE risk models, which currently do not adequately account for it.

While this study provides a robust data set from a multinational registry, its observational design and the inherent limitations of registry data, including potential reporting biases and variability in treatment across centers, suggest caution in generalizing the findings. The challenge of determining PE as the cause of death in patients with multimorbidities is acknowledged. Moreover, the dynamic nature of platelet counts and their management suggests that a longer follow‐up period may provide additional insights into the chronic management of these patients. Additionally, the effect of platelet transfusions (suggested by some guidelines only in selected patients with severe thrombocytopenia, not in those with moderate thrombocytopenia) remains unassessed. Separate analyses for PE risk stratification and the evaluation of vena cava filters or catheter‐directed therapies were not feasible due to the small number of patients in certain subgroups. Finally, despite multivariable adjustments, unmeasured factors could affect outcomes.

### How I diagnose and treat thrombocytopenia in geriatric patients [^de4f8842]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Thrombocytopenia in older individuals is a common but diagnostically challenging condition that has variable clinical impact to those who are affected. Diagnostic approach requires evaluation of the preexisting clinical conditions, detailed review of medications, and assessment for disorders that warrant urgent treatment. In this article, we describe a systematic approach to diagnosis of thrombocytopenia and present a schematic review for management strategies. Three clinical scenarios are presented that are relevant for their prevalence and management challenges in an older adult population. The first scenario addresses primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and reviews different treatment options. The second one addresses complications of thrombocytopenia in management of the myelodysplastic syndrome. The last one reviews diagnostic challenges of drug-induced ITP.

### Exome sequencing in 116 patients with inherited thrombocytopenia that remained of unknown origin after systematic phenotype-driven diagnostic workup [^9ca79d3c]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inherited thrombocytopenias (IT) are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by low platelet count that can result in a bleeding tendency of variable degree. In these disorders, thrombocytopenia can be isolated or associated with additional congenital defects; moreover, some cases of IT have a predisposition to develop additional diseases over time, such as hematologic malignancies, bone marrow aplasia and renal failure.

Until recently, the diagnosis of IT was based on a complex process requiring a multi-step clinical and laboratory characterization of patients and subsequent resequencing of candidate genes. The introduction of next-generation sequencing revolutionized the diagnostic approach to these disorders, allowing the analysis of virtually all known genes at one time by exome sequencing (ES). Moreover, application of next-generation sequencing led to the identification of many novel genes underlying IT. These advances revealed a picture of wide genetic heterogeneity, with at least 40 genes implicated; it should, however, be noted that only a few genes account for most of the cases, while most genes explain less than 2% cases each. In spite of the recent progress, almost half of patients with familial IT still remain without a definite molecular diagnosis, which would be of key importance for clinical management and counseling.

ES of large numbers of patients, in association with clustering of results according to standardized clinical or functional phenotypes, has proven effective in the description of novel forms of IT and the identification of causative variants in known IT genes, thus achieving a molecular diagnosis for a substantial proportion of patients.6–9 However, phenotype-based approaches may be ineffective when thrombocytopenia is non-syndromic, with no additional phenotypes contributing to the patient's clinical picture, or is not associated with detectable alterations in platelet function.

Here we report the analysis of 116 patients with non-syndromic IT who had remained without a definite molecular diagnosis after an extensive diagnostic workup. We show the power of the ES approach to improve the diagnostic yield over a phenotype-driven diagnostic algorithm and illustrate the reasons that make ES a strategy of choice in the molecular elucidation of these genetically heterogeneous disorders.

### Management of newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia: can we change outcomes? [^b43f6486]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia resulting from antibody-mediated platelet destruction combined with impaired platelet production is a common cause of thrombocytopenia. The decision to treat newly diagnosed patients is based on several factors including ceasing hemorrhagic manifestations, increasing the platelet count, prevention of bleeding, and inducing remission. Current standard first-line therapy is a course of corticosteroids. Although this treatment paradigm increases the platelet count in the majority of patients, a high percentage relapse after discontinuation of corticosteroid therapy. For this reason, intensification of first-line therapy that results in superior long-term remission rates would be desirable. This manuscript focuses primarily on adults with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), highlighting pediatric data and practice when applicable. The primary aim is to outline upfront strategies for treatment-naive patients with ITP to enhance remission rates, taking into account assessment of the risks and benefits of these approaches.

### How I diagnose and treat neonatal thrombocytopenia [^69c78e9f]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Neonatal thrombocytopenia, defined as the presence of a circulating platelet count < 150 × 10⁹/L, is a common abnormality in babies admitted to neonatal intensive care units. Thrombocytopenia that is typically mild and self-limiting often accompanies neonatal stress in scenarios such as premature delivery or intrauterine growth restriction. However, the differential diagnosis of neonatal thrombocytopenia is wide and includes potentially life-threatening disorders, such as bacterial sepsis, viral infection, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Distinguishing these causes of thrombocytopenia from entities such as genetic thrombocytopenia and fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia is critical for the accurate quantitation of significant adverse events, such as intracranial bleeding, and for the selection of treatments, such as platelet transfusion. In this review, we focus on common differential diagnoses of neonatal thrombocytopenia and highlight how the landscape of diagnosis and management is changing with recent advances in genomic technology and the completion of pivotal clinical trials of platelet transfusion practice. Increasing evidence highlights the need for judicious and restrictive use of platelet transfusions in neonates.

### Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^fc8905de]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2022). Medium credibility.

Hematologists are often consulted for thrombocytopenia in pregnancy, especially when there is a concern for a non-pregnancy-specific etiology or an insufficient platelet count for the hemostatic challenges of delivery. The severity of thrombocytopenia and trimester of onset can help guide the differential diagnosis. Hematologists need to be aware of the typical signs of preeclampsia with severe features and other hypertensive disorders of pregnancy to help distinguish these conditions, which typically resolve with delivery, from other thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) (eg, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or complement-mediated TMA). Patients with chronic thrombocytopenic conditions, such as immune thrombocytopenia, should receive counseling on the safety and efficacy of various medications during pregnancy. The management of pregnant patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia who are refractory to first-line treatments is an area that warrants further research. This review uses a case-based approach to discuss recent updates in diagnosing and managing thrombocytopenia in pregnancy.

### How to differentiate congenital from noncongenital chronic neutropenia at the first medical examination? Proposal of score: a pilot study from the French severe chronic neutropenia registry [^24dda240]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

We developed a diagnostic score to differentiate congenital from noncongenital neutropenia at the time of diagnosis using reliable data collected at the first visit of a patients with neutropenia.

Study Design

In a pilot retrospective study, we included 120 patients diagnosed with chronic neutropenia; 61 had congenital and 59 had noncongenital neutropenia. We reviewed patient medical charts and collected the initial complete blood count (CBC) and other reliable data. We used logistic regression to determine the probability that the neutropenia was congenital.

Results

On the initial CBC, the degree of neutropenia had no predictive value; only monocytosis > 1.5 × 10 9 /l, hemoglobin < 90 g/l, or mild thrombocytopenia < 150 × 10 9 /l suggested congenital neutropenia. The most predictive factors for congenital neutropenia were a medical history (consanguinity and patient history of neutropenia), severe infections, and oral stomatitis or gingivitis at the time of diagnosis. The age at diagnosis had limited predictive value.

Conclusion

A diagnosis of congenital neutropenia may be reliably suspected based only on information from the CBC, some basic information from patient and parent interviews, and a clinical examination. A pilot score with six factors that could be readily, reliably collected, should facilitate the diagnosis of congenital neutropenia.

### Diagnosis and management of maternal thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^27ba4228]. British Journal of Haematology (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a common finding in pregnancy, occurring in approximately 7–10% of pregnancies. It may be a diagnostic and management problem, and has many causes, some of which are specific to pregnancy. Although most cases of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy are mild, and have no adverse outcome for either mother or baby, occasionally a low platelet count may be part of a more complex disorder with significant morbidity and may be life-threatening. Overall, about 75% of cases are due to gestational thrombocytopenia, 15–20% secondary to hypertensive disorders; 3–4% due to an immune process, and the remaining 1–2% made up of rare constitutional thrombocytopenias, infections and malignancies. In this review, a diagnostic approach to investigating thrombocytopenia in pregnancy is presented, together with antenatal, anaesthetic and peri-natal management issues for mother and baby, followed by a detailed discussion on the specific causes of thrombocytopenia and the management options in each case.

### Autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: a rare manifestation of COVID-19 [^6f8130ad]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

We describe the case of a 65-year-old male who presented to an outside hospital for shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting 8 days after testing positive for COVID-19. Initial workup revealed massive bilateral pulmonary emboli and thrombocytopenia. The patient was then admitted to our hospital, received an inferior vena cava filter and initially started on argatroban for autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) prophylaxis. On hospital stay day 6, labs revealed a diagnosis of HIT in the setting of COVID-19. This case highlights the rare occurrence of a patient developing HIT without heparin exposure and in the setting of a novel infectious agent, COVID-19.

### Campylobacter jejuni and cytopenias [^6fba9715]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia in a febrile patient are not uncommon and may be a diagnostic clue in patients without an alternative explanation for cytopenias. This has not been reported in Campylobacter jejuni infections.

Methods

A healthy patient with fever, rigors, and an acute diarrheal illness was noted to have a white blood cell count of 2.65 × 10(9)/L and platelet level of 125 × 10(9)/L. Retrospective chart review of all adult C. jejuni stool-positive cases admitted over 1 year revealed leukopenia in 6 of 20 (30%), thrombocytopenia in 5 of 20 (25%), and both in 1 of 20 (5%).

Results

Cytopenias were mild, transient, and not associated with prolonged hospital stay or complications.

Conclusions

Acute C. jejuni infections should be added to the differential diagnosis of acute febrile illnesses that may be associated with leukopenia or thrombocytopenia. Cytopenias can be an important diagnostic clue in febrile illnesses, and their differential is presented.

Section I. A young female patient with immune thrombocytopenia: second-line treatment options

The patient's history

A 20-year-old female returns home from college. She notes heavier periods and easy bruising. Her internist sees that she is pale and has visible petechiae on her arms. Complete blood counts show mild anemia (hemoglobin 10.2 g/dL) and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 5x10 9 /L The internist sends her urgently to the emergency room concerned that she might possibly have leukemia. There is no hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy or other abnormal findings on physical examination.

Review of a peripheral blood smear reveals no blasts or abnormalities of other cell lines although her mean corpuscular volume is low (72 fL) and several of her very few platelets are large. She is diagnosed with ITP and given prednisone 1 mg/kg. Over the next few days, she has typical steroid-related side effects: feeling "a little crazy", insomnia and abdominal pain. Her bruises and petechiae disappear, and her period ends. Her hematologist prescribes oral iron supplements and changes her prednisone to dexamethasone 40 mg daily for 4 days. Her steroid-related side effects worsen during the 4 days on dexamethasone 40 mg; however, she soon feels better with no further petechiae, bruising, or menstrual bleeding noted. Her platelet count normalizes to 147x10 9 /L and her hemoglobin improves to 11.2 g/dL. She begins checking her blood counts monthly. The improved complete blood count with a nearly normal mean corpuscular volume excludes bone marrow failure, and also thalassemia trait or microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Similarly, the normal hemoglobin and neutrophil count do not suggest Evans syndrome. Her platelet counts remain in the normal range and her hemoglobin improves to the normal range. At her next visit, her platelet count has decreased to 80x10 9 /L. One month later, her platelet count is 28x10 9 /L with continued normal hemoglobin and infrequent small bruises. With her platelets trending downward, second-line treatment for her ITP is considered.

There is less urgency to consider secondary ITP or a missed diagnosis since she is doing well but at any change of management, it is good practice to re-evaluate. Below we consider some of the " what if " clinical scenarios for this young female.

### Management of hemostatic complications in acute leukemia: guidance from the SSC of the ISTH [^1cd0ee34]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute myeloid leukemia, more specifically with respect to management of thrombocytopenia, ISTH 2020 guidelines recommend to administer empiric platelet transfusion (one standard adult unit) for a daily platelet count < 10×10⁹/L in patients with acute leukemia without active bleeding or coagulopathy. Consider using a higher transfusion threshold (such as ≥ 20×10⁹/L) in patients with active bleeding, as determined by clinical factors, including the degree of hemorrhage, site of hemorrhage, and responsiveness to platelet transfusion.

### Practical guide to the diagnosis and management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^892d71d2]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2024). Medium credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an immune reaction to heparin associated with thrombocytopenia, thrombotic risk, and a high risk of morbidity and mortality. Given the frequent use of heparin and the common occurrence of thrombocytopenia in hospitalized patients, the diagnosis and management of HIT is a recurrent challenge in everyday inpatient care. This article presents practical guidance and tools to support the individual clinician providing evidence-based care to patients with suspected or confirmed HIT. The optimal diagnostic evaluation requires the stepwise use of risk-stratification tools and laboratory assays. Management requires the selection and use of nonheparin anticoagulation in these complex patients with both increased thrombotic risk and possible concurrent increased bleeding risk due to thrombocytopenia. Each step in the diagnostic and management process has important nuances and complexities, many of which vary based on patient characteristics and institutional resources. Given the many challenges of HIT care, truly practical management is best achieved when tools are implemented to support the delivery of consistent, high quality, and cost-effective care across health systems.

### Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) causing pulmonary emboli during coronary intervention [^91ad1177]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2008). Low credibility.

Thrombotic complications of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) can be devastating if not recognized and treated promptly. We describe an unusual case of rapid-onset HIT resulting in massive-bilateral pulmonary emboli in a 70 year-old man who developed chest pain during elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The diagnosis was made the following day after persistent chest pain and laboratory work demonstrating a new thrombocytopenia, a mildly elevated troponin, and positive DIC panel led to confirmatory imaging tests. HIT-related thrombosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chest pain in patients undergoing PCI.

American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2019 immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) guideline — corticosteroids versus observation in newly diagnosed adults: In adults with newly diagnosed ITP and a platelet count of < 30 × 10^9/L who are asymptomatic or have minor mucocutaneous bleeding, the ASH guideline panel suggests corticosteroids rather than management with observation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects), with a remark that there may be a subset for whom observation might be appropriate based on severity of thrombocytopenia, additional comorbidities, use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, need for upcoming procedures, and patients' values and preferences. For patients with a platelet count of ≥ 30 × 10^9/L who are asymptomatic or have minor mucocutaneous bleeding, the ASH guideline panel recommends against corticosteroids and in favor of management with observation (strong recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects), noting that for patients at the lower end of this threshold; for those with additional comorbidities, anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, upcoming procedures; and for elderly patients (> 60 years old), treatment with corticosteroids may be appropriate. A good practice statement specifies that the treating physician should ensure that the patient is adequately monitored for potential corticosteroid side effects and should conduct an assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (depression, fatigue, mental status, etc) while patients are receiving corticosteroids.

A low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) is a common finding especially in neonates who are admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. Due to the varied causes that can lead to neonatal thrombocytopenia, assessment and management can be challenging. Having an understanding of the causes of neonatal thrombocytopenia and their natural progression would help guide subsequent management. Therefore, we will be exploring the different circumstances where thrombocytopenia occurs and how to interpret and manage the neonate with thrombocytopenia in this interpretations article.

### Transitioning patients with immune thrombocytopenia to second-line therapy: challenges and best practices [^bc77c41f]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

2 SECOND‐LINE TREATMENT OPTIONS

Second‐line or maintenance therapy in persistent or chronic ITP (hereafter referred to as ITP) aims to establish a durable platelet response and to minimize bleeding events with a treatment that is safe, tolerable, and convenient for long‐term management. Splenectomy, thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO‐RAs), and rituximab are the standard second‐line treatment options in current use. 3, 4 Before initiation of a second‐line therapy, it is advisable to confirm the diagnosis of primary ITP by excluding potential non‐immune causes of thrombocytopenia as well as causes of secondary ITP if these have not been previously ruled out.

### Introduction to a review series on the treatment of thrombocytopenic disorders: something old, something new [^8fdb5d81]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

The importance of the more primitive hemostatic mechanism stands out in the natural experiments represented by those clinical disorders in which thrombocytopenia is a sufficient cause of bleeding, despite an intact coagulation system. Quite surprisingly, contrary to what is expected, there are clinical situations accompanied by a reduced number of platelets in which thrombosis is also a major factor of morbidity or mortality, posing dramatic management dilemmas (see, for example, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia). Conversely, thrombocytosis may be accompanied by a hemorrhagic tendency as in essential thrombocythemia, whose first denomination was 'hemorrhagic thrombocythemia'. Finally, as detailed in Balduini's review, in a significant proportion of cases with inherited thrombocytopenias an associated impaired platelet function may further aggravate the bleeding tendency. Even worse, in rarer cases, the genetic lesions have impacts beyond thrombopoiesis and thrombocytopenia is just one component of more complex syndromic forms or may herald the future development of hematologic malignancies or bone marrow aplasia or fibrosis, raising ethical dilemmas on how to best inform patients on their condition.

Figure 1 depicts the many inherited and acquired causes that can lead to thrombocytopenia and the main pathogenic mechanisms involved. It is quite evident that a precise diagnosis is essential not only for directing prognosis and treatment, but also for excluding any underlying or associated disorder requiring prompt identification. As Balduini mentions in his review, the prevalence of inherited thrombocytopenias is reported to be as high as more than two cases per 100.000 persons, an order of magnitude similar to that of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Nevertheless, only a very tiny proportion of patients is diagnosed with inherited thrombocytopenias at major hematology centers, thus highlighting the under-diagnosis of this pathology. No prevalence data are available for drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia, but its diagnosis is very difficult without a high index of suspicion and underdiagnosis is anticipated also for this condition. Indeed, even in expert centers, several cases of isolated thrombocytopenia are initially misdiagnosed as ITP with potentially dangerous consequences.

### American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia [^0069e39a]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

American Society of Hematology (ASH) immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) guideline — panel, scope, and key emphases: In 2016, ASH formed a multidisciplinary panel including 9 clinical experts, 5 pediatric clinical experts, 2 methodologists with expertise in ITP, and 2 patient representatives, used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach with evidence-to-decision frameworks to appraise evidence up to May 2017, and agreed on 21 recommendations covering management of ITP in adults and children with newly diagnosed, persistent, and chronic disease refractory to first-line therapy who have non–life-threatening bleeding; management approaches included observation, corticosteroids, IV immunoglobulin, anti-D immunoglobulin, rituximab, splenectomy, and thrombopoietin receptor agonists. The background notes minimal randomized-trial data to assist management, and the conclusions state there was a lack of evidence to support strong recommendations, that strategies avoiding medication side effects were favored, that a large focus was placed on shared decision-making (especially second-line therapy), and that future research should apply standard corticosteroid-dosing regimens, report patient-reported outcomes, and include cost-analysis evaluations.

### How do we diagnose immune thrombocytopenia in 2018? [^6341a9bd]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

In this report, we will review the various clinical and laboratory approaches to diagnosing immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), with a focus on its laboratory diagnosis. We will also summarize the results from a number of laboratories that have applied techniques to detect anti-platelet autoantibodies as diagnostic tests for ITP. Although there is considerable variability in methods among laboratories, there is general agreement that platelet autoantibody testing has a high specificity but low sensitivity. This suggests several possibilities: (1) the ideal test for ITP has yet to be developed, (2) current test methods need to be improved, or (3) ITP is the clinical expression of a variety of thrombocytopenic disorders with different underlying mechanisms. Even the clinical diagnosis of ITP is complex, and experienced clinicians do not always agree on whether a particular patient has ITP. Improvements in the diagnostic approach to ITP are necessary to improve the management of this disorder.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for platelet transfusion, more specifically with respect to indications for transfusion, hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia, ISTH 2020 guidelines recommend to administer empiric platelet transfusion (one standard adult unit) for a daily platelet count < 10×10⁹/L in patients with acute leukemia without active bleeding or coagulopathy. Consider using a higher transfusion threshold (such as ≥ 20×10⁹/L) in patients with active bleeding, as determined by clinical factors, including the degree of hemorrhage, site of hemorrhage, and responsiveness to platelet transfusion.

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^5958fcb1]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

An important cause of thrombocytopenia in elderly patients is myelodysplastic syndrome. A bone marrow examination is necessary to diagnose this condition. Typically, marrow will be hyperplastic, but marrow cells will be undergoing apoptosis and not producing mature blood cells and reveal dyspoiesis. Diagnostics have improved remarkably as has clinical discrimination of different subtypes of myelodysplastic syndrome. Nonetheless. cases of myelodysplastic syndrome early in their evolution may be difficult to distinguish from "difficult" ITP.

Drug-induced thrombocytopenia is a possibility since older patients may be taking more medications. Limited laboratory testing is available to demonstrate that thrombocytopenia is drug-induced. Diagnosis generally relies on recognizing medications likely to cause thrombocytopenia; one approach is to change medications if any are newly initiated. Viral infections could also occur in this population e.g. hepatitis C, cytomegalovirus.

Patients over the age of 60 are thought to have a higher likelihood of fatal and non-fatal serious bleeding compared to younger patients ;77–79 recent studies of intracranial hemorrhage have supported earlier findings demonstrating a higher risk in those above 60 years of age. Thus, it may be appropriate to pursue an aggressive approach in this patient, such as the addition of IVIG to steroids.

Which second-line treatment is optimal for a 63-year-old male?

Rituximab in an older male

In this case of ITP, the older man has a reasonable likelihood of a response but, even if he responds well, his response will very likely last only 6–12 months. The chance of a long-term (> 1 year) response is low. Furthermore, as discussed previously, after rituximab it would not be possible to vaccinate the patient against SARS-CoV-2, which is important since this 63-year-old is in a high-risk group and would benefit from boosters. As indicated, there is a 10–20% possibility of developing significant hypogammaglobulinemia when the combination of dexamethasone with rituximab is used. A good initial response followed by the expected relapse would allow rituximab to be reused, but it remains unlikely to lead to a cureand the probability of hypogammaglobulinemia occurring is thought to increase with repeated use.

### Thrombocytopenia in patients with melanoma receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy [^f0d1043c]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Thrombocytopenia, especially ITP, induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors appears to be a relatively uncommon irAE that is manageable with standard treatment algorithms. In our series, the majority of patients had mild thrombocytopenia that resolved spontaneously or responded to standard corticosteroid regimens. However, in two severe cases, steroids, IVIG, and rituximab were administered with ultimate recovery. In the first case, nivolumab monotherapy was resumed with excellent tolerance. On the other hand, the second patient relapsed with subsequent immune checkpoint inhibition.

Primary ITP is a disorder caused by the formation of autoantibodies targeting platelet antigens, leading to thrombocytopenia. ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion and may be challenging given the lack of specific testing and a wide differential diagnosis. ITP is thought to occur after an inciting event activates or alters the immune system, such as an infection, hematopoietic malignancy, or pharmacologic immune checkpoint inhibition. However, most cases are idiopathic in etiology. A majority of acute cases (50–90%) are responsive to standard corticosteroid and IVIG therapy, though a fraction of cases require second-line treatment, usually involving a combination of rituximab and a thrombopoietin agonist. In mouse models, there is loss of peripheral self-tolerance through alteration of immune homeostasis and evidence of regulatory T cell (Treg) deficiency associated with ITP. Comparison of bone marrow between patients with ITP and normal donors revealed that those with ITP have lower levels of Tregs and abnormal levels of Th1 and Th17 cells. Recent work demonstrated that patients with chronic ITP exhibit lower levels of PD-1 expression in total peripheral blood samples, compared with healthy controls. A single case report showed that a patient who developed nivolumab-induced ITP had higher PD-1 expression on B cells.

Our experience suggests that thrombocytopenia, including ITP, may rarely complicate immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy but is usually mild and can resolve spontaneously or with standard treatment algorithms. The onset of ITP varies substantially, though a majority occurs within the first 12 weeks after initiation of checkpoint inhibition, consistent with other irAEs. Although our observations on checkpoint inhibitor rechallenge after resolution of ITP are limited, our experience suggests that increased clinical vigilance should be used, especially with ipilimumab.

Observation versus intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in children with newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and no or minor bleeding — observational data showed similar bleeding and mortality between groups (0.6% with IVIG vs 0% with observation for bleeding; 1.8% with IVIG vs 0% with observation for mortality). The panel recognized IVIG harms including hemolysis at 6.3% and a black box warning for thrombosis and acute renal failure, and stated that the balance of effects favored observation rather than IVIG; when observation is chosen, close observation and follow-up must be possible with ready access to medical care. After the search, a randomized trial in children aged 3 months to 16 years with platelet count < 20 × 10^9/L and mild to moderate bleeding used a single dose of 0.8 mg/kg IVIG versus observation and found no difference in chronic disease (platelet count < 150 × 10^9/L at 6 months) or ongoing disease at 12 months, no deaths in either group, and grade 4 to 5 bleeding occurred in 9% of the observation group and 1% of the IVIG group; however, this trial enrolled children with moderate bleeding whereas the target population involves no or minor bleeding only.

Purpura is the result of hemorrhage into the skin or mucosal membrane. It may represent a relatively benign condition or herald the presence of a serious underlying disorder. Purpura may be secondary to thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction, coagulation factor deficiency or vascular defect. Investigation to confirm a diagnosis or to seek reassurance is important. Frequently, the diagnosis can be established on the basis of a careful history and physical examination, and a few key laboratory tests. Indicated tests include a complete blood cell count with platelet count, a peripheral blood smear, and prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times.

Abstract

The 2019 American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) included recommendations on the management of adults (recommendations 1–9) and children (recommendations 10–21) with primary ITP. We describe here the results of a review of the 2019 guidelines by a working group of experts requested by ASH to inform decision-making about the need for and timing of a guideline revision. An updated Medline and Embase search applied the same search terms as in the 2019 ASH guidelines, limited to systematic reviews and clinical trials, from May 2017 to July 2022. There were 193 studies identified, 102 underwent abstract reviews, and 54 full reviews. Each study was assessed based on relevance to the previous recommendation with regard to the population, prioritized outcomes, new outcomes, and study design. Reviewers assessed if the data would change the strength or the directionality of the existing recommendation or merit development of a new recommendation. Based on this review, the ASH Committee on Quality endorsed a focused update on second-line management for adults with ITP. In addition, there will be continued annual monitoring and reviewing of the 2019 ASH guidelines on ITP in full to evaluate when there is sufficient new evidence to warrant additional revisions.

### Diagnosis and management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^8099c488]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a prothrombotic disorder caused by antibodies to platelet factor 4/heparin (PF4/H) complexes. It presents with declining platelet counts 5 to 14 days after heparin administration and results in a predisposition to arterial and venous thrombosis. Establishing the diagnosis of HIT can be extremely challenging. It is essential to conduct a thorough clinical evaluation in addition to laboratory testing to confirm the presence of PF4/H antibodies. Multiple clinical algorithms have been developed to aid the clinician in predicting the likelihood of HIT. Once HIT is recognized, an alternative anticoagulant should be initiated to prevent further complications.

Gestational thrombocytopenia — obstetric management and follow-up: Pregnancies with gestational thrombocytopenia are generally not at increased risk of maternal bleeding complications or fetal thrombocytopenia, so interventions such as cesarean delivery and the determination of the fetal platelet count are not indicated, and women do not generally require any additional testing or specialized care, except follow-up platelet counts. No evidence is available to guide frequency of platelet counts and, therefore, the schedule of follow-up laboratory tests should be based on clinical reasoning; if diagnosed antepartum, expert opinion suggests that a platelet count be checked at each routine prenatal visit, and after childbirth, the platelet count should be repeated in 1–3 months to determine if resolution of the thrombocytopenia has occurred.

Acute promyelocytic leukemia — coagulopathy screening and transfusion targets — Because coagulopathy is common in patients with APL, it is important to screen with evaluation of PT, PTT, and fibrinogen during the initial workup and before any invasive procedure. Clinical coagulopathy is managed by aggressive transfusion support to maintain platelet counts of ≥ 50 x 10^9/L, by fibrinogen replacement with cryoprecipitate and fresh frozen plasma to maintain a level > 150 mg/dL, and by maintenance of PT and PTT close to normal values, with daily monitoring until resolution. Given the risks at diagnosis, invasive procedures including leukapheresis and/or central line placement should be avoided, and, if possible, diagnosis may be made using peripheral blood samples to minimize bleeding complications until coagulopathy is adequately controlled.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for myelodysplastic syndrome, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, BSH 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that the initial assessment of a patient with unexplained cytopenias may not confirm a diagnosis of MDS. Consider obtaining further follow-up and reassessment to reach a firm diagnosis.

### Management of hemostatic complications in acute leukemia: guidance from the SSC of the ISTH [^c08abe04]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, more specifically with respect to management of thrombocytopenia, ISTH 2020 guidelines recommend to administer empiric platelet transfusion (one standard adult unit) for a daily platelet count < 10×10⁹/L in patients with acute leukemia without active bleeding or coagulopathy. Consider using a higher transfusion threshold (such as ≥ 20×10⁹/L) in patients with active bleeding, as determined by clinical factors, including the degree of hemorrhage, site of hemorrhage, and responsiveness to platelet transfusion.
