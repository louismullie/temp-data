## Question

Lab abnormalities for pancreatic cancer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about laboratory abnormalities associated with pancreatic cancer and how to interpret them in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about established, guideline-endorsed tumor markers and their limitations. Then, I should review metabolic derangements such as new-onset diabetes and hyperglycemia as prediagnostic signals. Next, I will examine organ function patterns, especially cholestatic liver test abnormalities, and clarify where pancreatic enzymes fit. After that, I should assess hematologic changes like hypercoagulability. Finally, I will consider molecular/genomic abnormalities that guide therapy and summarize investigational biomarkers and how to integrate all this into a clinical framework with appropriate safeguards against overinterpretation.

> Let me first confirm the cornerstone serum tumor marker. CA 19–9 remains the standard biomarker recommended at baseline and for treatment monitoring, but it is not a screening test and cannot substitute for imaging or clinical assessment, especially in metastatic disease [^1154jiYc] [^1112bkcA] [^116vrJQu]. Hold on, I should verify its diagnostic performance and constraints: pooled estimates show sensitivity and specificity around 80–90%, but 5–10% of patients who are Lewis antigen–negative cannot synthesize CA 19–9, and obstructive jaundice, cholangitis, and other GI malignancies cause false positives, so specificity against benign pancreatic disease is limited to roughly 80–82% [^116VBumm] [^115pMQPi]. I need to ensure I mention ways to refine interpretation: FUT genotyping can personalize CA 19–9 reference ranges, and a high CA 19–9/CEA ratio may improve diagnostic discrimination in selected contexts, though these are adjunctive rather than replacements for imaging [^11548xrn] [^112upFaR].

> Next, I should review genomic and molecular abnormalities that are now standard-of-care, because "lab abnormalities" in pancreatic cancer include mandated molecular testing that changes therapy. I will now examine guideline directives: test for KRAS and BRCA alterations, evaluate MSI/MMR deficiency and NTRK fusions, and consider broader profiling in KRAS–wild-type tumors to find rare, actionable alterations for targeted therapies or clinical trials [^11663rDs] [^116ZJzP1] [^112iGg5K] [^115pkX7H] [^112WuVL6]. Wait, let me verify the scope: these results should be available early to inform treatment decisions after first-line therapy where applicable, and they are part of the baseline laboratory work-up in many centers, not an afterthought [^116ZJzP1].

> Now, I need to think about metabolic derangements as high-frequency lab abnormalities. New-onset diabetes and accelerating hyperglycemia often precede diagnosis by up to 2–3 years and represent a tumor-driven, paraneoplastic phenotype of type 3C diabetes rather than typical type 2 diabetes, with up to 80% demonstrating dysglycemia at presentation on fasting glucose or OGTT in some series [^1152kXFW] [^115LXiRh] [^117GkX9K]. Hold on, let me verify temporality: large cohort data show fasting glucose rises about three years before diagnosis, and the trajectory worsens more rapidly than in ordinary type 2 diabetes, supporting its use as a risk-enrichment signal in the appropriate clinical context [^115LXiRh] [^1152kXFW]. I should confirm the bidirectionality too: long-standing diabetes is a risk factor, but the cancer can also induce diabetes, so laboratory hyperglycemia needs clinical correlation rather than automatic attribution to type 2 diabetes [^1152kXFW] [^117GkX9K].

> I will now examine organ function test patterns, especially cholestatic liver tests. Let me consider the typical pattern: head-of-pancreas tumors that compress the distal bile duct often produce elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase with varying AST/ALT elevations, a pattern that can drive CA 19–9 false positives and should prompt imaging to look for biliary obstruction rather than assuming tumor progression [^113FugTH] [^112NYjCw] [^116VBumm]. Hmm, wait a minute, what about pancreatic enzymes like amylase and lipase: I initially thought "exocrine insufficiency may elevate enzymes", but that's not quite right — exocrine insufficiency lowers enzyme output, whereas elevations in amylase or lipase reflect concurrent pancreatitis, which can coexist but is not a reliable or specific laboratory hallmark of pancreatic cancer, so I should correct that assumption and treat enzyme bumps as non-specific unless imaging suggests pancreatitis [^113FugTH]. I need to check for potential confounders: a minority of pancreatic cancer patients can have elevated serum IgG4, which may mimic autoimmune pancreatitis serologically, so IgG4 alone does not exclude malignancy and must be interpreted cautiously with imaging and tissue diagnosis when appropriate [^114kTg4q].

> Next, I should review hematologic abnormalities and the hypercoagulable state. Pancreatic cancer induces a prothrombotic milieu; while routine coagulation labs may be normal or non-specific, real-world signals include increased initiation of anticoagulants in the one to two years before diagnosis, reflecting venous thromboembolism risk and serving as a prediagnostic clue when coupled with other lab or clinical changes [^1152kXFW]. But wait, what if we overinterpret anticoagulant starts as cancer-specific: I should double-check that these patterns are not diagnostic alone and only enrich pretest probability when aligned with metabolic derangements, cholestasis, imaging, and symptom evolution [^1152kXFW].

> I will now examine emerging blood-based biomarkers that are promising but investigational. Let me verify ctDNA: comprehensive ctDNA assessments, including mutant KRAS and cfDNA kinetics, prognosticate outcomes and detect progression with a median lead over imaging of roughly 19 days and over CA 19–9 of around two weeks, suggesting earlier molecular detection of relapse though not yet a standard replacement for radiology [^114kgZrQ] [^116mzLrW]. Hold on, I should not jump to conclusions about clinical adoption: multi-analyte panels such as PancSure that combine urine LYVE1/REG1B with serum CA 19–9 show high AUCs for early disease in validation cohorts, and salivary mRNA signatures can discriminate cancer from controls, but these need further prospective validation and are best used in trials or specialized settings rather than routine practice today [^notfound] [^11198qxq].

> Let me consider medication-change patterns as a "virtual lab abnormality" reflecting underlying biology. Starting antidiabetic therapy — especially insulin — within two years is associated with roughly a two-fold imminent risk of pancreatic cancer after adjusting for BMI and weight loss, and increases in anticoagulant use also rise prediagnosis, which I should treat as contextual clues that should trigger closer review of glucose trends, LFTs, and appropriate imaging when the clinical story fits [^1152kXFW] [^114pWQj4]. I should confirm that such patterns are signals for risk enrichment and not stand-alone diagnostic criteria, to avoid overtesting and false positives in low-prevalence populations [^1152kXFW].

> Finally, I need to integrate these domains into a practical, hierarchical approach. I should double-check that baseline labs include CA 19–9 with awareness of Lewis antigen status or FUT-genotype effects, comprehensive metabolic panel to look for cholestasis, and fasting glucose or HbA1c with attention to rapid deterioration, while concurrently obtaining molecular profiling early to inform targeted therapy or trial options and never relying on CA 19–9 in place of imaging for staging or response assessment [^11548xrn] [^1154jiYc] [^116vrJQu] [^116ZJzP1]. Next, I should review that monitoring in advanced disease combines clinical status, CA 19–9 trajectory, and serial imaging at 8–12 week intervals in line with guideline practice, reserving investigational biomarkers like ctDNA or multi-analyte panels for research or specialized programs and using multidisciplinary review for complex or high-risk scenarios, including those identified through surveillance programs [^112Jwf8X] [^112hcD7E] [^1111mUqw] [^114kgZrQ].

---

Pancreatic cancer commonly features **elevated CA 19–9** and **cholestatic LFTs** (bilirubin, ALP, GGT) from biliary obstruction [^116VBumm]. New-onset diabetes or **worsening hyperglycemia** is common, reflecting tumor-induced insulin resistance or beta-cell dysfunction [^1152kXFW] [^115LXiRh]. Additional findings include elevated CEA, anemia, thrombocytosis, and a **hypercoagulable state** with increased D-dimer and fibrinogen [^114pWQj4]. CA 19–9 is **not specific** and can be elevated in benign conditions or absent in Lewis-negative patients; it should not replace **imaging** for diagnosis or response assessment [^115pMQPi] [^11548xrn] [^116vrJQu].

---

## Tumor markers

### CA 19–9 (carbohydrate antigen 19–9)

- **Clinical utility**: Most commonly used tumor marker for pancreatic cancer; recommended by ASCO and ESMO for baseline assessment and monitoring [^1154jiYc] [^1112bkcA].

- **Diagnostic performance**: Sensitivity 70–90%, specificity 68–91%; limited by false positives in benign biliary disease and false negatives in Lewis-negative individuals (5–10%) [^1154jiYc] [^116VBumm].

- **Clinical limitations**: Not suitable for screening or definitive diagnosis; not a substitute for imaging in response assessment [^113iAa6Q] [^116vrJQu].

---

### CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen)

CEA is **often elevated** in pancreatic cancer but is less sensitive and specific than CA 19–9; it is used as an adjunct.

---

## Liver function tests (LFTs)

Pancreatic cancer — especially tumors of the head — often causes biliary obstruction, leading to **cholestatic LFT abnormalities**:

| **Test** | **Typical abnormality** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Total bilirubin | Elevated | Obstructive jaundice |
| Direct bilirubin | Elevated | Cholestasis |
| Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) | Elevated | Biliary obstruction |
| Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) | Elevated | Cholestasis |
| AST/ALT | Mildly elevated | Hepatocellular injury from obstruction |

---

## Glucose metabolism abnormalities

Pancreatic cancer frequently causes **disturbances in glucose metabolism** [^1152kXFW]:

- **New-onset diabetes**: Occurs in ~50% of patients; often within 2–3 years before diagnosis [^1152kXFW] [^115LXiRh].

- **Hyperglycemia**: Common due to insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction [^115LXiRh].

- **Clinical significance**: New-onset or worsening diabetes in older adults may be a paraneoplastic sign [^1152kXFW].

---

## Hematological abnormalities

Pancreatic cancer is associated with several **hematological abnormalities** [^115LXiRh] [^114pWQj4]:

| **Abnormality** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|
| Anemia (normocytic, normochromic) | Chronic disease, malnutrition, or occult bleeding |
| Thrombocytosis | Paraneoplastic inflammation; poor prognosis |
| Leukocytosis | Inflammation or infection |
| Hypercoagulability (elevated D-dimer, fibrinogen) | Increased VTE risk [^114pWQj4] |

---

## Electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities

Pancreatic cancer can cause various **electrolyte and metabolic disturbances**:

| **Abnormality** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|
| Hyponatremia | SIADH or dehydration |
| Hypokalemia | Vomiting, diarrhea, or malnutrition |
| Hypocalcemia | Malabsorption or vitamin D deficiency |
| Hypomagnesemia | Malnutrition or malabsorption |
| Elevated LDH | Tumor burden or metastasis |

---

## Summary table of laboratory abnormalities

| **Laboratory test** | **Typical abnormality** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| CA 19–9 | Elevated | Tumor marker; limited specificity [^116VBumm] |
| CEA | Elevated | Adjunctive tumor marker [^116VBumm] |
| Total bilirubin | Elevated | Obstructive jaundice |
| Direct bilirubin | Elevated | Cholestasis |
| ALP | Elevated | Biliary obstruction |
| GGT | Elevated | Cholestasis |
| AST/ALT | Mildly elevated | Hepatocellular injury |
| Glucose | Elevated | New-onset diabetes [^1152kXFW] |
| Hemoglobin | Decreased | Anemia of chronic disease |
| Platelets | Elevated | Thrombocytosis |
| WBC | Elevated | Inflammation or infection |
| D-dimer | Elevated | Hypercoagulability [^114pWQj4] |
| LDH | Elevated | Tumor burden |

---

## Clinical implications

- **Diagnosis**: Laboratory abnormalities support diagnosis but are not definitive; imaging and biopsy are required [^112NYjCw] [^115NWqT3].

- **Prognosis**: Elevated CA 19–9, thrombocytosis, and hypercoagulability indicate advanced disease and poorer outcomes.

- **Monitoring**: CA 19–9 and LFTs help monitor treatment response and detect recurrence, but imaging remains essential [^112Jwf8X] [^116vrJQu].

---

Laboratory abnormalities in pancreatic cancer include elevated CA 19–9, cholestatic LFTs, new-onset diabetes, anemia, thrombocytosis, and hypercoagulability. These findings support diagnosis, inform prognosis, and guide monitoring but are **not definitive**; **imaging and biopsy are required** for confirmation.

### Pancreatic cancer is associated with medication changes prior to clinical diagnosis [^1152kXFW]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Diabetes is both a long-term risk factor for pancreatic cancer and is caused by pancreatic cancer several years before its diagnosis. Altered glucose homeostasis is one of the most prevalent prediagnostic phenotypic traits in patients who develop pancreatic cancer. Importantly, new-onset diabetes and worsening of glucose control in long-standing diabetes may occur in up to half of all patients who develop pancreatic cancer. Rapid increases in blood glucose are also more frequent in patients with pancreatic cancer-associated diabetes compared to type 2 diabetes in the general population.

The addition of antidiabetic medications to a patient's medication program may signal worsening glucose control, providing risk-stratifying information in individuals with both long-term and recent-onset diabetes, even if those conditions are known from billing codes or provider notes. In the study, initiation of any antidiabetic medication was associated with a nearly two-fold increased risk of pancreatic cancer in the next two years in females, even when accounting for a patient's BMI, recent weight loss, or prior diabetes diagnosis. Furthermore, stronger associations were identified for insulin compared to oral hypoglycemic medications, indicating the utility of medication change to provide insights into disease severity.

We also identified increased two-year risks of pancreatic cancer diagnosis for individuals who started anticoagulant medication or stopped antihypertensive medications. Pancreatic cancer is known to induce a hypercoagulable state.

### Metabolic syndrome is linked to the incidence of pancreatic cancer [^111StjZw]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

Cancers and cardiovascular diseases have placed a significant burden on both individual patients and national economies around the world. Cancer has been gradually and eventually conquered because of early detection and prompt diagnosis using novel imaging techniques or biomarkers for diagnosis, as well as rapid progress in regimens for innovative medical and surgical treatments. However, pancreatic cancer has been recognized as the most lethal of all cancers because the incidence and mortality rates are nearly similar, suggesting that the time of prevention and diagnosis may be too late for pancreatic cancer to be treated comprehensively.

Every year, more than 40,000 people in Japan are newly diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and effectively preventing and early diagnosing pancreatic cancer is extremely difficult, resulting in delayed diagnosis and the inoperability and incurability of this cancer. Pancreatic cancer, one of the most common tumors, has now become a leading cause of death among all cancers, with an estimated mortality rate approaching 100%. Indeed, in the United States, pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death, and it is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in Japan.

Pancreatic cancer is reportedly linked to smoking, type II diabetes mellitus (T2D), and chronic pancreatitis, all of which may impair pancreatic function, i.e. production of not only digestive enzymes such as amylase, lipase, and trypsin but also insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin. The first three factors are related to food digestion, while the latter three are responsible for hormonal regulation.

### Pancreatic cancer is associated with medication changes prior to clinical diagnosis [^114pWQj4]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

In the several years before a clinical diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, patients develop symptoms and signs that might serve as an early warning for the growing malignancy. For example, new-onset metabolic alterations such as hyperglycemia and weight loss occur during this time window and are increasingly recognized as defining a high-risk group. Similarly, pancreatic cancer patients are commonly noted in clinical practice to have started or stopped certain medications in the 1–2 years before their clinical diagnosis due to the development of new symptoms or conditions such as hyperglycemia, venous thromboembolism, abdominal discomfort, and depression. Nevertheless, few studies have characterized the value of these medication changes in defining those at risk of a subsequent pancreatic cancer diagnosis.

To examine medication changes in the two-year prediagnosis time period, we investigated longitudinal, prospectively collected assessments of medication use among up to 148,973 participants from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS, a large prospective cohort of US female nurses) and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS, a large prospective cohort of US male health professionals), to determine the association of medication change patterns with subsequent pancreatic cancer development. Specifically, we hypothesized that starting antidiabetic, anticoagulant, antacid, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), or antidepressant medications and stopping antihypertensive medications would be associated with an increased likelihood of pancreatic cancer development in the next 2 years.

### Symptoms and patient factors associated with diagnostic intervals for pancreatic cancer (SYMTOM pancreatic study): A prospective cohort study [^113vqeJ2]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is the tenth most common cancer in the UK; however, outcomes are poor, in part due to late diagnosis. We aimed to identify symptoms and other clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with pancreatic cancer diagnosis and diagnostic intervals.

We conducted this prospective cohort study at seven hospitals in two regions in England. Participants aged 40 years or older, who were referred for suspicion of pancreatic cancer, were recruited. Data were collected using a patient questionnaire and primary care and hospital records. Descriptive and regression analyses were performed to examine associations between symptoms and patient factors with the total diagnostic interval (time from onset of the first symptom to the date of diagnosis), comprising patient interval (time from first symptom to first presentation) and health system interval (time from first presentation to diagnosis).

We recruited 391 participants between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2014 (24% response rate). Of these, 119 (30%) participants were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer (41 [34%] had metastatic disease), 47 (12%) with other cancers, and 225 (58%) with no cancer. A total of 212 (54%) patients had multiple first symptoms, whereas 161 (41%) patients had a solitary first symptom. In this referred population, no initial symptoms were reported more frequently by patients with cancer than by those with no cancer. Several subsequent symptoms predicted pancreatic cancer: jaundice (51 [49%] of 105 patients with pancreatic cancer vs. 25 [12%] of 211 patients with no cancer; p < 0.0001).

### A clinical laboratory improvement amendments/college of American pathologists-compliant noninvasive laboratory-developed test for early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [^116FBiMM]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2025). High credibility.

A noninvasive test for earlier detection of pancreatic cancer in individuals at higher risk is currently unavailable. We devised PancSure, a laboratory-developed test based on the protein biomarkers lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE1) and regenerating family member 1 β (REG1B). These biomarkers are measured in urine by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, along with the commonly used serum/plasma carbohydrate antigen 19.9 (CA19.9), and evaluated using an updated PancRISK algorithm for data interpretation.

The test was validated in 565 patients:

- 117 asymptomatic patients without any known pancreatic condition or malignancies (21%)
- 242 symptomatic patients with benign pancreatic diseases (43%)
- 206 patients with confirmed cancers (36%) with
	- 161 (77.5%) having stage I to II disease
	- 45 (22.5%) having stage III to IV disease

PancSure passed all specifications during analytical validation. It distinguishes early-stage resectable cancer from asymptomatic individuals with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.89–0.97) and 85% to 90% sensitivity (SN) and 78% to 87% specificity (SP); from symptomatic patients with an AUC of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.81–0.91) and 83% to 85% SN and 72% to 83% SP; and from all noncancer patients (pooled controls) with an AUC of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.84–0.93) and 83% to 85% SN and 78% to 87% SP.

PancSure is a noninvasive clinical-grade test with a 48-hour turnover, ready for implementation, providing a viable solution for the earlier detection of pancreatic cancer in at-risk groups for improved patient care.

### Increased pancreas cancer in a bio-technological research laboratory [^112P7hem]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is extremely rare among people under 55 years old. Its prognosis is poor, and the causal background remains almost unresolved. A previous study observed an increased occurrence of pancreatic cancer in workers in a French biochemical laboratory.

- **Case report**: During an approximate 10-year period in a Danish biochemical laboratory with about 50 stable employees, four cases of pancreatic cancer have been diagnosed at a mean age of 53 years. Approximately 0.02 cases should be expected if the laboratory employees had experienced the same rate of pancreatic cancer as that observed in the respective general Danish populations.

- **Result**: All four cases had a long-term occupational history of exposure to carcinogens during the early biotechnology period.

- **Conclusions**: Causal conclusions cannot be made yet, but observation of former and present workers in biotechnological laboratories and their cancer occurrence is warranted.

### Pancreatic cancer [^1177pXjY]. Nature Reviews. Disease Primers (2016). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is a major cause of cancer-associated mortality, with a dismal overall prognosis that has remained virtually unchanged for many decades. Currently, prevention or early diagnosis at a curable stage is exceedingly difficult; patients rarely exhibit symptoms, and tumors do not display sensitive and specific markers to aid detection. Pancreatic cancers also have few prevalent genetic mutations; the most commonly mutated genes are KRAS, CDKN2A (encoding p16), TP53, and SMAD4 — none of which are currently druggable.

Therapeutic options are indeed limited, and progress in drug development is impeded because most pancreatic cancers are complex at the genomic, epigenetic, and metabolic levels, with multiple activated pathways and crosstalk evident. Furthermore, the multilayered interplay between neoplastic and stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment challenges medical treatment.

Fewer than 20% of patients have surgically resectable disease; however, neoadjuvant therapies might shift tumors towards resectability. Although newer drug combinations and multimodal regimens in this setting, as well as the adjuvant setting, appreciably extend survival, approximately 80% of patients will relapse after surgery and ultimately die of their disease. Thus, consideration of quality of life and overall survival is important.

In this Primer, we summarize the understanding of the salient pathophysiological, molecular, translational, and clinical aspects of this disease. In addition, we present an outline of potential future directions for pancreatic cancer research and patient management.

### The clinical utility of biomarkers in the management of pancreatic adenocarcinoma [^1146wzvK]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States, and survival rates have seen minimal improvement over the past few decades. Although results are poor, surgical resection is considered the only curative therapeutic intervention for pancreatic cancer, thereby emphasizing the significance of effective diagnostic and prognostic tools to improve outcomes. As such, biomarkers play a promising role in the development of personalized treatments for patients with pancreatic cancer. Prognostic biomarkers, such as serum carbohydrate antigen 19–9 in particular, as well as cancer stem cell markers, provide valuable insight into the biological processes of an individual and their likely course of disease. This, consequently, allows for the assessment of optimal therapeutic intervention.

Efforts target putative predictive biomarkers such as BRCA2, PALB2, and SPARC to determine their influence on tumor response to targeted therapies. As research progresses, more evidence will provide clinicians with guidelines on the utilization of biomarkers to accurately stage and tailor personalized treatment to the needs of specific patients with pancreatic cancer.

### Diagnostic performance of a tumor marker gene test to personalize serum CA19–9 reference ranges [^11548xrn]. Clinical Cancer Research (2023). High credibility.

A highly accurate blood test could improve the early detection of pancreatic cancer. One step towards this goal is improving the diagnostic performance of CA19–9. Common inactivating variants in fucosyltransferase (FUT) genes involved in the CA19–9 synthetic pathway influence its levels in the circulation. These variants can be used to define an individual's functional FUT group, reflecting their predicted relative level of CA19–9 synthesis. We introduced a "CA19–9 tumor marker gene test" in the Johns Hopkins Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory as a companion test to serum CA19–9 and established reference ranges for each functional FUT group. Using a case/control design involving patients with resectable-stage pancreatic cancer and controls from the Cancer of the Pancreas Screening study, we find that using the tumor marker gene test to assign individuals their appropriate CA19–9 reference range significantly improved diagnostic performance.

### Comprehensive ctDNA measurements improve prediction of clinical outcomes and enable dynamic tracking of disease progression in advanced pancreatic cancer [^114kgZrQ]. Clinical Cancer Research (2023). High credibility.

The only blood-based biomarker currently used to monitor treatment response for pancreatic cancer is carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19–9), which has several drawbacks that limit its clinical utility. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as an alternative blood-based marker, demonstrating prognostic and predictive value across multiple cancer types. Our study shows that ctDNA can be effectively used as a marker to monitor treatment response and tumor progression in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.

Detection of ctDNA persistence after the initiation of treatment indicates a high probability of tumor progression and inferior survival. Furthermore, ctDNA surveillance during follow-up detects disease progression with a median lead time of 19 days on radiological imaging/time of death, compared with 6 days for CA19–9. Future prospective and interventional clinical trials are necessary to implement these findings in clinical practice and improve patient outcomes in pancreatic cancer.

### Metastatic pancreatic cancer: ASCO guideline update [^116ZJzP1]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pancreatic cancer, specifically in relation to genetic testing, the ASCO 2020 guidelines recommend early testing for actionable genomic alterations in patients who are potential candidates for additional treatment after first-line therapy. This includes both germline and tumor (somatic) testing for MSI/MMR deficiency, BRCA mutations (excluding variants of unknown significance), and NTRK gene fusions. The results can lead to therapies such as poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor therapy, TRK fusion inhibitors, and participation in clinical trials for targeted therapies. Genomic testing should be conducted as part of the initial assessment to ensure results are available at the time of treatment decision-making after first-line therapy where applicable.

### Targeting early diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer among the diabetic population: A comprehensive review of biomarker screening strategies [^117GkX9K]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer leads to type 3C pancreaticogenic diabetes mellitus. Approximately 50–74% of pancreatic cancer-related diabetes is of recent onset (2–3 years duration). The prevalence of dysglycemia in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is higher when diagnosis is made using a standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) rather than fasting glucose levels. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism are frequently missed in PDAC.

In this context, the importance of preoperative diagnosis of dysglycemia needs to be emphasized, as it has been shown to affect surgical strategy in up to 15% of patients. Although specific clinical guidelines defining pancreatic cancer complicated by diabetes remain lacking, the consensus is that new-onset diabetes occurring within 2–3 years before a pancreatic cancer diagnosis is frequently a paraneoplastic manifestation known as pancreatic cancer-new onset diabetes mellitus (PC-NODM). Often classified as type 3C diabetes, this condition encompasses various pancreatic exocrine disorders and hyperglycemia resulting from distinct pathological mechanisms, including chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, hemochromatosis, cystic fibrosis, and previous pancreatic surgeries.

Prior research consistently reports that approximately 80% of pancreatic cancer patients present glucose metabolism abnormalities, ranging from diabetes to impaired glucose tolerance. Certain studies suggest pancreatic cancer may induce insulin resistance and compromise pancreatic beta-cell function through the secretion of circulating tumor proteins and cytokines, contributing to new-onset diabetes (NOD).

### Early detection of pancreatic cancer-a defined future using lessons from other cancers: A white paper [^115YWA88]. Pancreas (2016). Low credibility.

- **Identifying existing and novel biomarkers of early PDAC**: Numerous biomarkers have already been identified with widely varying levels of rigor in testing and validation. A thorough investigation of biomarkers that have been studied in early-stage PDAC needs to be initiated. This involves a group of biostatisticians and independent researchers using predetermined levels of evidence to curate a panel of biomarkers that meet thresholds for validation studies. These researchers will then participate in a think tank organized by philanthropy and governmental agencies to determine the final selection of biomarkers targeted for further validation. This in silico purge of existing biomarkers will identify those that are ready for validation in presymptomatic samples identified in action item no. 2. This is required because the retrospective sample resource is limited in number and sample volumes.

- **Identifying novel biomarkers of PDAC**: Emerging novel technologies promise to provide previously untested approaches to early detection. Some are in nascent stages of development, while others are still to be discovered. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has reviewed the first round of applicants for its recently launched "Pancreatic Cancer Detection Consortium (U01)". The goal of this request for application is to establish multidisciplinary teams of researchers and clinicians to conduct research to improve the detection of early-stage PDAC and characterization of its development.

### Temporality of body mass index, blood tests, comorbidities and medication use as early markers for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC): a nested case-control study [^115LXiRh]. Gut (2023). High credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common form of pancreatic malignancy and is associated with an almost universally poor prognosis, mainly attributed to late-stage diagnosis. Currently, there is no screening program, and symptom-based early detection remains challenging due to the vague or asymptomatic nature of earlier stage disease.

While understanding the symptom profiles of pancreatic cancer presents one opportunity for earlier diagnosis, there remains a need to robustly identify clinical and biochemical factors to inform the identification of higher-risk subpopulations for earlier intervention with imaging or recruitment to screening studies.

An earlier small study suggested that fasting blood glucose was significantly elevated beginning three years prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis, and BMI significantly decreased beginning one year prior. However, besides being limited by its relatively small sample size, the majority of patients in this study had only one observation up to 12 months prior to diagnosis, and hence, it would not serve as a robust assessment for longer time trends. Further, evidence on other commonly used blood tests, such as liver markers and blood counts, and their temporal associations relating to pancreatic cancer remain limited. In addition, some research has identified chronic pancreatitis, prior cancers, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), and antidiabetic medications to be associated with an increased risk of PDAC diagnosis, but limited studies on their temporal trends are available.

### The prognostic and predictive value of serum CA19.9 in pancreatic cancer [^111Lj5Un]. Annals of Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Serum CA19.9 possesses many features of a robust or clinically useful biomarker and has been well studied to define its limitations. Despite this, there are no clear applications for CA19.9 in the management of pancreatic cancer as there are for other similar serum biomarkers such as PSA for prostate cancer, CEA for colorectal cancer, and CA 125 in ovarian cancer. Although sometimes controversial, these biomarkers are used in routine practice and form integral components of clinical trials to further advance clinical management.

We focused on defining potential roles for serum CA19.9 at key clinical decision-making time points in patients who have demonstrable CA19.9 production. If an individual is identified to have the capacity to produce CA19.9, either through Lewis antigen testing or through a level over 5 U/ml at diagnosis as a surrogate, postoperative CA19.9 measurements have potential prognostic and predictive value. Firstly, normalization of CA19.9 postoperatively is associated with a good prognosis. Secondly, postoperative CA19.9 levels > 90 U/ml may be associated with a lack of response to adjuvant gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. Thirdly, although the numbers are small, a normal CA19.9 after the completion of adjuvant therapy is potentially associated with an excellent prognosis.

These potential applications are summarized in Figure 3, which also proposes how CA19.9 levels could be incorporated into trials to inform clinical decision-making.

### Salivary transcriptomic biomarkers for detection of resectable pancreatic cancer [^11198qxq]. Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

The lack of detection technology for early pancreatic cancer invariably leads to a typical clinical presentation of incurable disease at initial diagnosis. New strategies and biomarkers for early detection are sorely needed. In this study, we conducted a prospective sample collection and retrospective blinded validation to evaluate the performance and translational utilities of salivary transcriptomic biomarkers for the noninvasive detection of resectable pancreatic cancer.

- **Methods**: The Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2.0 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) was used to profile transcriptomes and discover altered gene expression in saliva supernatant. Biomarkers discovered from the microarray study were subjected to clinical validation using an independent sample set of 30 pancreatic cancer patients, 30 chronic pancreatitis patients, and 30 healthy controls.

- **Results**: Twelve messenger RNA biomarkers were discovered and validated. The logistic regression model, with a combination of 4 messenger RNA biomarkers (KRAS, MBD3L2, ACRV1, and DPM1), could differentiate pancreatic cancer patients from noncancer subjects (chronic pancreatitis and healthy control), yielding a receiver operating characteristic plot area under the curve value of 0.971 with 90.0% sensitivity and 95.0% specificity.

- **Conclusions**: The salivary biomarkers possess discriminatory power for the detection of resectable pancreatic cancer, with high specificity and sensitivity. This report provides the proof of concept of salivary biomarkers for the noninvasive detection of a systemic cancer and paves…

### New biomarkers and targets in pancreatic cancer and their application to treatment [^112bkQTm]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Late diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (pancreatic cancer) and the limited response to treatments result in an exceptionally poor prognosis. Advances in our understanding of the molecular events underpinning pancreatic cancer development and metastasis offer the hope of tangible benefits for patients. In-depth mutational analyses have shed light on the genetic abnormalities in pancreatic cancer, providing potential treatment targets. New biological studies in patients and in mouse models have advanced our knowledge of the timing of metastasis of pancreatic cancer, highlighting new directions for the way in which patients are treated.

Furthermore, our increasing understanding of the molecular events in tumorigenesis is leading to the identification of biomarkers that enable us to predict response to treatment. A major drawback, however, is the general lack of an adequate systematic approach to advancing the use of biomarkers in cancer drug development, as highlighted in a Cancer Biomarkers Collaborative consensus report.

In this review, we summarize the latest insights into the biology of pancreatic cancer and their repercussions for treatment. We provide an overview of treatments and, finally, we discuss novel therapeutic approaches, including the role of biomarkers in therapy for pancreatic cancer.

### Early detection of pancreatic cancer in high-risk individuals: Where do we go from here [^113s8Y2E]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is a lethal disease that is commonly diagnosed at a late stage. Screening asymptomatic patients is necessary for early detection, but this is not currently recommended in the general population. As demonstrated in the study, a significant number of patients at increased risk can be diagnosed using either MRI/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography or endoscopic ultrasound. Further collaborative efforts are needed to define the ideal population for testing and refine the approach to pancreatic cancer surveillance.

### Diagnostic accuracy and added value of blood-based protein biomarkers for pancreatic cancer: A meta-analysis of aggregate and individual participant data [^116VBumm]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) poses a major diagnostic and therapeutic challenge as symptoms often develop at an advanced disease stage, and patients are typically diagnosed too late. Consequently, the prognosis for patients with PDAC is poor, with a dismal relative 5-year survival rate of 10.8%. The opportunity for improving this prognosis lies foremost in accurate and early disease detection, which could aid earlier treatment initiation and increase the possibility of surgical intervention.

The modalities currently used for diagnosing PDAC are a combination of clinical symptoms, radiological findings, and pathological confirmation of the diagnosis by fine-needle aspiration or brush cytology. These diagnostic measures are invasive and time-consuming, and often the diagnosis remains inconclusive until after surgery is performed. Carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19–9) is a protein most commonly used as a non-invasive tumor biomarker for patients suspected of PDAC. CA19–9 is produced in normal pancreatic tissue but can be highly expressed by cancerous pancreatic cells and is therefore regarded as a tumor marker that can support the diagnosis of PDAC. However, as its diagnostic power is perceived to be limited, with a reported sensitivity and specificity between 82% and 91%, it is mainly used for monitoring disease and follow-up after therapy. Additionally, Lewis-negative patients are not able to produce CA19–9, which hampers its diagnostic utility. As such, an efficient, accurate, and minimally invasive method for diagnosing PDAC remains necessary.

### Validation of biomarkers for early detection of pancreatic cancer: Summary of the Alliance of Pancreatic Cancer Consortia for Biomarkers for Early Detection Workshop [^115bLcEk]. Pancreas (2018). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death in the United States, and the 5-year relative survival for patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer is less than 10%. Early intervention is the key to a better survival outcome. Currently, there are no biomarkers that can reliably detect pancreatic cancer at an early stage or identify precursors that are destined to progress to malignancy. The National Cancer Institute, in partnership with the Kenner Family Research Fund and the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, convened a Data Jamboree on Biomarkers workshop on December 5, 2016, to discuss and evaluate existing or newly developed biomarkers and imaging methods for early detection of pancreatic cancer. The primary goal of this workshop was to determine if there are any promising biomarkers for early detection of pancreatic cancer that are ready for clinical validation.

The Alliance of Pancreatic Cancer Consortia for Biomarkers for Early Detection, formed under the auspices of this workshop, will provide the common platform and the resources necessary for validation. Although none of the biomarkers evaluated seemed ready for a large-scale biomarker validation trial, a number of them had sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to warrant additional research, especially if combined with other biomarkers to form a panel.

### Molecular pathogenesis and targeted therapy of pancreatic cancer [^111RLnRx]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

The accumulation of multiple genetic and/or epigenetic abnormalities is required for the generation and progression of cancers, and the survival of cancer cells might depend on addiction to these abnormalities. Disruption of such dependency on the abnormal molecules should cause cancer cell death; this phenomenon, known as oncogene addiction, forms the rationale for molecular targeted therapy. Pancreatic cancer, especially pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, is one of the most lethal malignancies in humans and remains a challenging problem in targeted therapy compared to other malignancies such as pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. This review summarizes the molecular pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer based on recent studies of driver mutations, including chromatin remodeling factors, and explores promising concepts such as "cancer stemness" and the "stromal niche" for novel targeted therapy strategies.

### Comprehensive ctDNA measurements improve prediction of clinical outcomes and enable dynamic tracking of disease progression in advanced pancreatic cancer [^116mzLrW]. Clinical Cancer Research (2023). High credibility.

Despite being a relatively uncommon disease, pancreatic cancer is currently the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death in the Western world. Recent advances in treatment have improved survival for patients with advanced disease, who make up the majority of patients with pancreatic cancer. Nonetheless, the median overall survival (OS) for this patient group is less than one year. The tumor marker carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19–9) is currently the only blood-based biomarker in routine clinical use to monitor the treatment response for pancreatic cancer. However, CA19–9 has several drawbacks that limit its clinical value, including poor sensitivity, false positivity in the presence of obstructive jaundice, and false-negative results in Lewis-negative phenotype patients, who are not able to produce CA19–9. Consequently, radiological imaging is still required to determine disease progression, with subsequent changes in therapy.

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a promising new tool for predicting clinical outcomes and monitoring the treatment response in patients with cancer. We previously demonstrated that both indirect detection of ctDNA using the total cell-free (cfDNA) concentration and cfDNA fragmentation analyses, as well as direct detection of mutant KRAS, have prognostic value in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. In a pilot study, we further demonstrated the potential value of using ctDNA to monitor the treatment response in these patients. The potential of ctDNA in monitoring patients with pancreatic cancer has also been investigated in several studies.

### Early detection of pancreatic cancer: Current state and future opportunities [^1156Vvxa]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the third leading cause of cancer death in the United States, a lethal disease with no screening strategy. Although diagnosis at an early stage is associated with improved survival, clinical detection of PDAC is typically at an advanced symptomatic stage when best-in-class therapies have limited impact on survival.

In recent years, this status quo has been challenged by the identification of novel risk factors, molecular markers of early-stage disease, and innovations in pancreatic imaging. There is now expert consensus that screening may be pursued in a cohort of individuals with an increased likelihood of developing PDAC based on genetic and familial risk.

The review summarizes the known risk factors of PDAC, knowledge, and recent observations pertinent to the early detection of PDAC in these risk groups, and outlines future approaches that will potentially advance the field.

### Clinical practice guidelines for pancreatic cancer 2019 from the Japan Pancreas Society: A synopsis [^115223Zj]. Pancreas (2020). Low credibility.

- **Pancreatic fluid cytology**: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with pancreatic fluid cytology is recommended in patients with abnormal pancreatic duct findings, but no mass lesions. Particular attention should be paid to the possible development of acute pancreatitis precipitated by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. The recommendation strength is weak; evidence level is D. Agreement rates (N = 36): 1 = 6%, 2 = 92%, 3 = 0%, 4 = 0%, 5 = 3%.

- **Staging or sg**:
	- **Contrast-enhanced MDCT**: Contrast-enhanced CT (MDCT is desirable) is recommended for the staging of pancreatic cancer and assessment of its resectability. The recommendation strength is strong; evidence level is B. Agreement rates (N = 35): 1 = 97%, 2 = 3%, 3 = 0%, 4 = 0%, 5 = 0%.
	- **Abdominal MRI**: The performance of contrast-enhanced MRI is recommended for staging pancreatic cancer and assessing its resectability. The recommendation strength is weak; evidence level is C. Agreement rates (N = 39): 1 = 3%, 2 = 90%, 3 = 3%, 4 = 0%, 5 = 5%.

### Early detection of sporadic pancreatic cancer: Summative review [^115bk36G]. Pancreas (2015). Low credibility.

For the purposes of this article, patient resources for biomarkers will be categorized into six classes: the general population, an at-risk population, symptomatic patients who do not have pancreatic cancer (PC), patients with newly diagnosed disease, patients undergoing treatment, and patients who fail treatment.

The general population resources include data and sample collections from the broader population, which may be collected from population-based studies, clinic-based (primary care) settings, or convenience sampling of random volunteers. These are typically regarded as "healthy controls".

The at-risk population includes unaffected relatives from families with a genetic predisposition to cancer and unaffected individuals whose lifestyle, exposure to carcinogens, or presence of ancillary disease (e.g. pancreatitis, diabetes) puts them at risk for developing PC.

Symptomatic patients who do not have PC are extremely valuable control subjects. These patients may present with abdominal pain, weight loss, and/or diarrhea; however, imaging of the pancreas is completely normal. When developing a biomarker for the earlier detection of disease in symptomatic patients, this control group will be essential.

Patients with newly diagnosed disease are those who have been diagnosed with PC. Patients undergoing treatment are those with PC undergoing treatment for their disease. Patients who fail therapy are those who have failed all therapies or who are not able to take additional therapies due to cumulative toxicities or disease progression.

### Serum immunoglobulin G fraction 4 levels in pancreatic cancer: Elevations not associated with autoimmune pancreatitis [^114kTg4q]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Autoimmune pancreatitis is an uncommon inflammatory disease of the pancreas that presents with clinical features, such as painless jaundice and a pancreatic mass, similar to those caused by pancreatic cancer. Patients with autoimmune pancreatitis frequently have elevated serum immunoglobulin G fraction 4 (IgG4) levels, and their pancreatic tissue may show IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltration. It is imperative to differentiate autoimmune pancreatitis from pancreatic cancer because autoimmune pancreatitis typically responds to corticosteroid treatment. A previous Japanese study reported that serum IgG4 greater than 135 mg/dL was 97% specific and 95% sensitive in predicting autoimmune pancreatitis.

- **Objective**: To prospectively measure serum IgG4 levels in pancreatic cancer patients to ascertain whether increased levels might be present in this North American population.

- **Design**: We collected blood samples and phenotypic information on 71 consecutive pancreatic cancer patients and 103 healthy controls who visited our clinics between October 2004 and April 2006. IgG4 levels were determined using a single radial immunodiffusion assay. A serum IgG4 level greater than 135 mg/dL was considered elevated.

- **Results**: Five cancer patients had IgG4 elevation, with a mean serum IgG4 level of 160.8 mg/dL. None of our cancer patients with plasma IgG4 elevation demonstrated evidence of autoimmune pancreatitis. One control subject demonstrated elevated serum IgG4 unrelated to identified etiology.

- **Conclusions**: As many as 7% of patients with pancreatic cancer have serum IgG4 levels.

### Symptoms and patient factors associated with diagnostic intervals for pancreatic cancer (SYMPTOM pancreatic study): a prospective cohort study [^116dmJDJ]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is the tenth most common cancer in the UK, accounting for 3% of all new cancers in 2012. Incidence of the disease is rising, reflecting both an ageing population and an increased prevalence of obesity and diabetes. No effective screening methods are yet available, and most cases of pancreatic cancer have already invaded local structures or metastasized by the time patients are diagnosed. Survival from pancreatic cancer is very poor, with less than 5% of patients alive at 1 year. Despite advances in treatment and outcomes, a 10-year survival of 1% has remained unchanged for more than 40 years.

The diagnostic pathway for pancreatic cancer comprises a series of stages or intervals that each contribute to the overall period of time between onset of symptoms and initiation of treatment. The total diagnostic interval comprises the patient interval (from onset of first symptom to first healthcare consultation) and the health system interval (from first consultation via referral and investigations to diagnosis and initiation of treatment); shorter patient and health system intervals are associated with longer survival. In the past few years, reports have suggested that both intervals are longer for pancreatic cancer than for other common cancers, such as lung or urological cancer.

- **Research in context**:

	- **Evidence before this study**: We searched PubMed with the MeSH terms "symptom", "diagnosis", "pancreatic cancer", and "interval" for all reports published before Dec 31, 2015. Little evidence exists for symptomatic presentations preceding pancreatic cancer.

### Early detection of sporadic pancreatic cancer: Summative review [^114SngAt]. Pancreas (2015). Low credibility.

Developing biomarkers for the early detection of pancreatic cancer (PC) is crucial. Identifying PC before invasion, especially given the lack of effective systemic therapies, could significantly impact survival outcomes. The focus is on developing biomarkers that can detect advanced precancerous lesions, such as PanIN-3, IPMN with high-grade dysplasia, or carcinoma in situ.

- **Early detection biomarker: Target population**: There is a significant need for noninvasive yet highly discriminatory biomarkers for early PC detection. These biomarkers would be particularly beneficial for patients in whom PC is clinically suspected as part of the differential diagnosis. An accurate and cost-effective biomarker could enable a simple blood test for patients presenting with common but nonspecific PC symptoms such as epigastric pain, pain with eating, weight loss, unexplained diarrhea, and elevated bilirubin. Currently, the median diagnosis time for PC is two months after initial presentation to a care provider. This delay is partly due to clinicians' hesitation to order costly CT scans, which involve radiation exposure, for nonspecific symptoms when the pretest probability is relatively low. The availability of a highly accurate and inexpensive test could overcome this hurdle, allowing for earlier diagnostic testing and potentially downstaging the disease by reducing the delay to diagnosis.

### Defining pancreatitis as a risk factor for pancreatic cancer: The role, incidence, and timeline of development [^111CPxzA]. Pancreas (2019). Low credibility.

Acute and/or chronic pancreatitis has been implicated as an important risk factor for pancreatic cancer. However, the incidence and temporal relationship of pancreatitis before pancreatic cancer diagnosis remain unclear. We aim to understand the role and incidence of pancreatitis temporally with the development of pancreatic cancer.

- **Methods**: A population-based study was used to investigate the temporal relationship between pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer diagnoses. Intervals of 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months were developed. Demographical data, including age, sex, and race, were recorded and analyzed.

- **Results**: A total of 50,080 patients were found to have a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, of which 7420 (14.8%) had prior diagnoses of pancreatitis. Of those, 92% were between the ages of 40 and 89 years. African Americans had a higher rate of pancreatitis before cancer diagnosis compared with whites (21.2% vs. 14.8%, P < 0.0001). Further analysis revealed that pancreatitis occurred in 81.3% of patients 3 months before a diagnosis of pancreas cancer, and 98.9% had established diagnoses of pancreatic cancer within 3 years.

Screening of patients older than 40 years who have pancreatitis and unclear etiology of pancreatitis may be warranted, especially in African Americans and male individuals.

### Major molecular markers in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and their roles in screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment [^112u8cDE]. Pancreas (2011). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is notorious for its late presentation, early and aggressive local invasion, metastatic potential, and poor outcome. It presents at a clinically advanced stage that precludes the possibility of surgical resection in most cases and shows constitutive resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy in others. As a result, mortality from this disease parallels its incidence rates. Recent breakthroughs in the molecular biology of pancreatic cancer have assisted in translational research, giving hope for individualized therapy and better disease management. Molecular biology tools are guiding early diagnosis, the assessment of prognosis, and isolation of novel, more effective therapeutic targets. This review discusses the signature mutations of pancreatic cancer, implications of these mutations to pancreatic cancer biology, their linked pathways, and recent advances in their understanding as biomarkers as diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic tools in dealing with this disease.

### Screening for pancreatic cancer: Why, how, and who [^116fTtHQ]. Annals of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer mortality in the United States, with 5-year survival rates for patients with resectable tumors ranging from 15% to 20%. However, most patients present with distant metastases that are not resectable and have a 5-year survival rate of close to 0%. This demonstrates a need for improved screening to identify pancreatic cancer while the tumor is still localized and amenable to surgical resection.

Studies of patients with pancreatic tumors incidentally diagnosed demonstrate longer median survival than tumors discovered only when the patient is symptomatic, suggesting that early detection may improve outcomes. Recent evidence from genomic sequencing indicates a 15-year interval for genetic progression of pancreatic cancer from initiation to the metastatic stage, suggesting a sufficient window for early detection. Still, many challenges remain in implementing effective screening.

Early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer relies on developing screening methodologies with highly sensitive and specific biomarkers and imaging modalities. It also depends on a better understanding of the risk factors and natural history of the disease to accurately identify high-risk groups that would be best served by screening. This review summarizes our understanding of the biology of pancreatic cancer relevant to methods available for screening. At this time, given the lack of proven benefit in this disease, screening efforts should probably be undertaken in the context of prospective trials.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for pancreatic cancer, the ASGE 2022 guidelines provide specific recommendations for genetically susceptible individuals. It is recommended to consider endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) as the initial screening test in the following situations:

- **Very high risk for pancreatic cancer**: Conditions such as Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and familial atypical multiple mole melanoma are highlighted.

- **Possibility to combine EUS with screening upper endoscopy or colonoscopy**: This is particularly relevant for Lynch syndrome and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.

- **Contraindications to MRI**: Considerations include claustrophobia, contrast allergy, implanted metal, and renal failure.

These guidelines aim to improve early detection and management of pancreatic cancer in individuals with a genetic predisposition.

### Conditions at risk of pancreatic cancer: The radiology perspective [^117W9mx1]. European Journal of Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most aggressive cancers worldwide, with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma being the most common malignant pancreatic lesion, associated with a poor prognosis. While surgical resection is the only curative treatment, only a minority of patients are eligible for surgery due to its diagnosis at advanced stages. Therefore, strategies for early detection of pancreatic cancer are needed. This article aims to provide a state-of-the-art review of the most common conditions associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer.

- **Conditions linked to risk of pancreatic cancer development**: These include certain pancreato-biliary anatomical variants, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, mucinous cystic neoplasm, and familial pancreatic cancer with specific genetic mutations.

- **Early imaging signs of pancreatic cancer**: These signs can be incidentally encountered on CT or MRI performed for other indications and should be promptly recognized by radiologists to avoid delays in diagnosis. The features include focal pancreatic atrophy, contour deformity, dilation of the main pancreatic duct (MPD), changes in the caliber of the MPD, abrupt interruption of the MPD, and biliary tree dilation.

MRI, with the adoption of abbreviated protocols, has been increasingly evaluated for the follow-up of cystic lesions. Although screening of the general population is not recommended due to the low incidence and high costs, surveillance with MRI can be considered in selected high-risk individuals.

### ASGE guideline on screening for pancreatic cancer in individuals with genetic susceptibility: summary and recommendations [^1139HKgR]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2022). High credibility.

The ASGE 2022 guidelines provide recommendations for screening and diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, particularly for individuals with genetic susceptibility. The guidelines suggest that the age to begin screening should be determined based on the specific genetic condition:

- **BRCA2 pathogenic variant**: Begin screening at age 50, or 10 years earlier than the youngest relative diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.
- **BRCA1 pathogenic variant**: Begin screening at age 50, or 10 years earlier than the youngest relative diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.
- **PALB2 pathogenic variant**: Begin screening at age 50, or 10 years earlier than the youngest relative diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.
- **Familial pancreatic cancer syndrome**: Begin screening at age 50, or 10 years earlier than the youngest relative diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Screen all first-degree relatives of affected family members.
- **Familial atypical multiple mole melanoma syndrome**: Begin screening at age 40, or 10 years earlier than the youngest relative diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.
- **Peutz-Jeghers syndrome**: Begin screening at age 35, or 10 years earlier than the youngest relative diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.
- **Heterozygotes for ATM pathogenic variant with first- or second-degree relative with pancreatic cancer**: Begin screening at age 50, or 10 years earlier than the youngest relative diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.
- **Lynch syndrome with first- or second-degree relative with pancreatic cancer**: Begin screening at age 50, or 10 years earlier than the youngest relative diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.
- **Autosomal-dominant hereditary pancreatitis**: Begin screening at age 40.

### Early detection of pancreatic cancer: The role of industry in the development of biomarkers [^113vipXy]. Pancreas (2017). Low credibility.

Niven R. Narain outlined that there are critical unmet needs in diagnostics, prognostics, and theranostics in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer. Clinicians need to be able to use biomarkers to stratify treatment decisions prior to surgery, chemotherapy, or clinical trial engagement. Biomarker research must account for factors beyond laboratory validation to determine the optimal dose for pharmaceuticals to minimize toxicity. He emphasized that cancer is more than just tumors; beyond tumor genetics and molecular profiling, the tumor microenvironment and the systems microenvironment must also play a fundamental role. The most sustainable biomarkers may arise from the environment around the cancer, and that information must be captured.

The important question for the biomarker researcher is how wide and how deep to go? Just because something is expressed in biology does not mean that it drives a substantive change in function. Project Survival performs an integrated phenomic assessment on every single tissue and biofluid sample, capturing the full biological and physiological narrative of the patient at that given time. The expression data must be correlated with the functional or phenotypic data to appreciate the complexity of the underlying clinical phenotypes. Narain emphasized that precision medicine means understanding clinical phenotypes at all stages of cancer. Deep molecular profiling provides a comprehensive understanding of a patient's health, which allows for informed decision making regarding treatment strategies.

### Pancreatic cancer insights: Optimization of the diagnostic capacity of tumor biomarkers [^112upFaR]. Laboratory Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the deadliest malignancies. The aim of this study was to determine the usefulness of the carbohydrate antigen 19.9 (CA19.9)/carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) ratio as a diagnostic tool.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective observational study (2015–2019) including laboratory requests with increased CA19.9 and CEA but no previous neoplasia. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed for the CA19.9/CEA ratio and for CA19.9 and CEA alone for the detection of PC, and cutoff values for all strategies were selected separately and in combination.

- **Results**: A total of 373 individuals were included. The area under the curve (AUC) for CA19.9/CEA was 0.872, whereas the AUC for CA19.9 was 0.847 and for CEA was 0.554. Cutoff values with the greatest diagnostic power were CA19.9/CEA > 40, CA19.9 > 1130 U/mL, and CEA > 14.5 U/mL. The combination of CA19.9/CEA > 40 with CA19.9 > 550 U/mL maximized the diagnostic accuracy for PC.

- **Conclusion**: Our results highlight the relevance of the measurement of serum CA19.9 and CEA in the detection of PC.

### A clinical prediction model to assess risk for pancreatic cancer among patients with acute pancreatitis [^113EoziR]. Pancreas (2024). Low credibility.

We aimed to develop and validate a prediction model as the first step in a sequential screening strategy to identify acute pancreatitis (AP) individuals at risk for pancreatic cancer (PC).

- **Materials and methods**: We performed a population-based retrospective cohort study among individuals 40 years or older with a hospitalization for AP in the US Veterans Health Administration. For variable selection, we used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression with 10-fold cross-validation to identify a parsimonious logistic regression model for predicting the outcome, PC diagnosed within 2 years after AP. We evaluated model discrimination and calibration.

- **Results**: Among 51,613 eligible study patients with AP, 801 individuals were diagnosed with PC within 2 years. The final model (area under the receiver operating curve, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.67–0.73) included histories of gallstones, pancreatic cyst, alcohol use, smoking, and levels of bilirubin, triglycerides, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and albumin. If the predicted risk threshold was set at 2% over 2 years, 20.3% of the AP population would undergo definitive screening, identifying nearly 50% of PC associated with AP.

- **Conclusions**: We developed a prediction model using widely available clinical factors to identify high-risk patients with PC-associated AP, the first step in a sequential screening strategy.

### Pancreatic cancer: Rapid evidence review [^113FugTH]. American Family Physician (2024). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is relatively uncommon and often has a poor prognosis because patients typically develop signs or symptoms at a late stage of the illness. Patients with a family history, especially those with genetic syndromes, are at a significantly increased risk of pancreatic cancer. Modifiable risk factors include smoking, heavy alcohol use, and obesity. Although patients at increased risk should be screened, screening is not recommended for asymptomatic people at average risk.

The differential diagnosis for a symptomatic patient is broad. It includes gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, chronic pancreatitis, biliary dyskinesia, cholelithiasis, gastroparesis, or constipation. Initial serologic testing should include transaminase and bilirubin levels and, in patients with midepigastric pain, lipase levels. Pancreas-protocol, contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography is the imaging test of choice. Carbohydrate antigen 19–9 is the most studied cancer marker and moderately accurate in patients suspected of having cancer; however, the positive predictive value is 0.9% in asymptomatic patients.

Treatment includes neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and surgery if the cancer is resectable. The treatment approach is best determined by a multidisciplinary, high-volume center. For a patient undergoing chemotherapy, nutritional and psychosocial support and palliation of symptoms should be goals during treatment.

### Diagnostic accuracy and added value of blood-based protein biomarkers for pancreatic cancer: A meta-analysis of aggregate and individual participant data [^112MDhZ9]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis is reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies Statement.

- **Search strategy**: Systematic literature searches were conducted in the bibliographic databases Medline, Embase, Wiley/Cochrane Library, and Web of Science (Core Collection) from inception up to November 2, 2021, in collaboration with a medical information specialist. An updated search was conducted on June 15, 2022. Reference lists of primary studies and review articles were screened for additional publications. The full search strategies for all databases can be found in the Supplementary Appendix.

- **Eligibility criteria**: Articles were included that collected blood samples at the time of diagnosis and reported the diagnostic accuracy of blood-based protein biomarkers for PDAC in adults. Studies were excluded if they collected blood samples after chemotherapy, included less than ten patients in either the PDAC or the control group, did not use histopathological diagnosis as the reference standard for diagnosing PDAC, or did not provide enough data to construct two-by-two diagnostic contingency tables. For comparative studies between CA19–9 and blood-based proteins, articles were included if they used a fully paired or randomized design.

- **Study selection and screening**: Two reviewers (L.N.C.B. and M. A.) independently screened all potentially relevant titles and abstracts for eligibility. The full text of potentially eligible articles was checked for inclusion criteria.

### The prognostic and predictive value of serum CA19.9 in pancreatic cancer [^117MsQu9]. Annals of Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most lethal solid organ malignancies. Pancreatectomy offers the only potential for cure but is only possible in a minority of patients. Even in those patients who undergo resection, most die because occult extrapancreatic metastatic disease was likely present at the time of diagnosis. Systemic therapies are only modestly effective in advanced disease but have a significant impact in the adjuvant setting, with 5-fluorouracil and gemcitabine both having efficacy in a subgroup of patients and increasing 5-year survival from 10%–15% with surgery alone to 20%–25%. As a consequence, there is an urgent need to develop biomarkers to better stratify patients for treatment modalities and for the testing of novel therapeutic strategies. Carbohydrate antigen 19.9 (CA19.9), first isolated in 1979, is the only available serum biomarker for PC and has shown some utility as a diagnostic adjunct and a prognostic marker but is not widely used in routine clinical practice. Serum biomarkers such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in prostate cancer, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in colorectal cancer, and CA 125 in ovarian cancer, which have similar limitations and, although sometimes controversial, are routinely used and are an integral component of clinical trials in those diseases.

Defining the subgroup of individuals where CA19.9 measurement is robust in predicting prognosis and chemotherapeutic responsiveness for PC would improve management and overall outcomes. Here, we show that serum CA19.9 has distinct potential clinical applications.

### Resectability of presymptomatic pancreatic cancer and its relationship to onset of diabetes: A retrospective review of CT scans and fasting glucose values prior to diagnosis [^113pVWEQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

The timeline of progression of pancreatic cancer from resectable to unresectable disease is unknown. New-onset diabetes often occurs in pancreatic cancer, and it is unclear if the cancer is resectable at the onset of diabetes. We determined the resectability of pancreatic cancer on abdominal CT scans done prior to clinical diagnosis and correlated resectability with onset of diabetes.

- **Methods**: All CT scans done at diagnosis or before pancreatic cancer diagnosis were reviewed. Pancreatic changes were classified as normal, potentially resectable, or unresectable pancreatic cancer. Fasting blood glucose values obtained at and prior to diagnosis were available for 18 patients. The date of onset of diabetes and the interval between onset of diabetes and diagnosis of cancer were noted.

- **Results**: Thirty patients fulfilled inclusion criteria. Prior to diagnosis, 28 patients had 38 CT scans done at a median of 18 months (range 1–41) before cancer diagnosis. At cancer diagnosis, only 7 out of 30 patients could undergo margin-negative surgical resection. CT scans done 6 or more months prior to diagnosis showed either a normal pancreas (N = 20) or a resectable mass (N = 6); none had unresectable cancer. The mean interval between onset of diabetes and diagnosis of pancreatic cancer was 10 months (range 5–29 months). At the onset of diabetes, three patients had normal pancreas, six had resectable, and four had unresectable pancreatic cancer.

- **Conclusions**: Pancreatic cancer is frequently undetectable or resectable on CT scans done six or more months prior to clinical diagnosis. At onset of diabetes, pa

### Drug metabolism and pancreatic cancer [^115cPdMo]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer remains a fatal disease in the majority of patients. The era of personalized medicine is upon us, customizing therapy according to each patient's individual cancer. Potentially, therapy can be targeted at individuals who would most likely have a favorable response, making it more efficacious and cost-effective. This is particularly relevant for pancreatic cancer, which currently portends a very poor prognosis. However, there is much to be done in this field, and more studies are needed to bring this concept to reality.

### Pancreatic ductal carcinoma risk associated with hereditary cancer-risk genes [^112FSgGZ]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2022). Low credibility.

The study examined a testing population from September 2013 to May 2020, involving 676,667 individuals who underwent clinical genetic testing due to suspicion of hereditary cancer risk. This initiative was conducted by Myriad Genetic Laboratories, Inc, based in Salt Lake City, UT, USA, a nationally accredited facility under Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments and College of American Pathology standards. Clinical information and self-reported ancestry were gathered from provider-completed test request forms, with all individuals providing consent for clinical testing. The testing data was anonymized for analytical purposes. Additionally, a waiver of consent for research was authorized by the Advarra institutional review board (Pro00036775).

Participants were excluded from the analysis if they were under 18 years old at the time of testing, had undergone prior genetic testing for familial or founder mutations, or were from states prohibiting the use of de-identified genetic data for research purposes. Inclusion in the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cohort was contingent on a personal history of PDAC being indicated on the test request form.

The multigene hereditary cancer panel testing involved DNA extraction from blood or saliva using established technologies. The next-generation sequencing hereditary pan-cancer panel test included 25–35 genes, specifically:

- **Cancer susceptibility genes**: APC, ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDH1, CDK4, CDKN2A, CHEK2, HOXB13
- **DNA repair and maintenance genes**: MLH1, MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, MUTYH, NBN, PALB2, PMS2, RAD51C, RAD51D
- **Gene variants related to other conditions**: AXIN2, BMPR1A, EPCAM, GALNT12, GREM1, NTHL1, POLD1, POLE, PTEN, RNF43, RPS20, SMAD4, STK11, TP53

Sequencing and large rearrangement analysis were conducted for all genes on the panel, except for HOXB13, which was sequencing only.

### Targeting early diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer among the diabetic population: A comprehensive review of biomarker screening strategies [^114oKe8p]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus, a metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, affects approximately 537 million individuals globally, with an estimated 6.7 million deaths attributable to diabetes in 2021, predominantly occurring in low- and middle-income countries. The relationship between diabetes mellitus and pancreatic cancer has attracted significant research attention due to their intricate, bidirectional pathogenic interactions, which remain incompletely understood.

The primary objective of this review is to systematically analyze and synthesize existing evidence regarding the association between diabetes mellitus and pancreatic cancer. Specifically, the review aims to evaluate and highlight promising early biomarker-based screening strategies tailored for diabetic populations. By addressing these points, we seek to identify novel and practical approaches for the early detection and clinical management of pancreatic cancer, ultimately improving survival outcomes among this high-risk patient group.

### Metabolic biomarker signature to differentiate pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma from chronic pancreatitis [^115pMQPi]. Gut (2018). High credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is projected to be the third leading cause of cancer-related death by 2030 due to delayed diagnosis and slow progress in treatment options. Chronic pancreatitis (CP) arises with an incidence of between 4 and 23 per 100,000 in different populations (the prevalence is 10-fold higher) and represents a risk factor for pancreatic cancer and a frequent differential diagnosis. Commonly used diagnostic methods for either disorder include transabdominal ultrasound, various blood tests, and trans-sectional imaging. The best-established blood test for this purpose is the carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19–9), a Lewis antigen of the MUC1 protein class. Unfortunately, CA19–9 can also be elevated in patients with non-malignant diseases, including liver cirrhosis (LC), CP, cholangitis, and other gastrointestinal cancers. CA19–9 has been reported to discriminate between patients with pancreatic cancer and healthy controls (sensitivity 80.3%, 95% CI 77.7 to 82.6%; specificity 80.2%, 95% CI 78.0 to 82.3%) and benign pancreatic disease (sensitivity 78.2%, 95% CI 72.3 to 80.4%; specificity 82.8%). As CA19–9 is not expressed in Lewis blood-type negative patients, its sensitivity cannot theoretically surpass 92%.

The fact that the sensitivity and specificity of the distinction between cancer and CP is often no better than 65% or 60%, respectively, has prompted a search for alternative biomarkers. Our study was designed to exclude suspected pancreatic cancer (local, locally advanced, and metastatic) in patients with CP, and we therefore aimed at optimizing the negative predictive value (NPV).
