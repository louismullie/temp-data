how to treat headache in dka

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat headache in diabetic ketoacidosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether headache in DKA signals cerebral edema and how urgently to act. Then, I should verify the immediate bedside assessment and whether to treat before imaging. Next, I will consider first-line hyperosmolar therapy if cerebral edema is suspected. After that, I need to adjust standard DKA management to minimize cerebral edema risk while continuing definitive metabolic therapy. I should also review when to obtain neuroimaging to exclude other intracranial causes. Then, I will think about routine DKA care, electrolyte management, and monitoring. Finally, I need to consider if and when to use analgesics and outline prevention strategies for future episodes, including patient education and euglycemic DKA nuances.

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance of headache in DKA, because I should not jump to conclusions about its predictive value. Headache in DKA is a red flag for evolving cerebral edema, particularly when accompanied by vomiting or altered mentation, and it typically arises within hours of initiating therapy, but I need to verify how predictive headache alone is before overcalling it as cerebral injury; in a large pediatric cohort, treatment for cerebral injury occurred in about 3% of DKA episodes and was not statistically more frequent in those reporting headache versus those who did not, so headache alone is not sufficient to diagnose cerebral injury, even though it should heighten vigilance given the potentially catastrophic risk of cerebral edema with notable mortality and morbidity, especially in children but also reported in adults [^114dYH1Z] [^11327pwX] [^114x9CFg].

> Hold on, I should verify what to do immediately at the bedside before reaching for analgesics. I will now examine the neurologic status and vital signs, documenting a baseline Glasgow Coma Scale and trending for any decline, because a falling GCS, increasing drowsiness, irritability, incontinence, cranial nerve deficits, pupillary changes, vomiting, seizures, and late bradycardia are worrisome for increased intracranial pressure in the context of DKA; if these are present, I need to ensure that hyperosmolar therapy is started without delay while arranging emergent neuroimaging, as treatment should not wait for a scan when cerebral edema is suspected [^114dYH1Z] [^11327pwX] [^114nZHFC].

> Next, I should review first-line therapy for suspected cerebral edema during DKA. Let me think about dosing and options: mannitol 0.5–1 g/kg IV as a bolus or 3% hypertonic saline 5–10 mL/kg over about 30 minutes are standard approaches to rapidly reduce cerebral water content; both agents were used in pediatric cohorts for clinically apparent cerebral injury, and the choice can be guided by hemodynamics, serum sodium, and local protocols, but the key is timely administration at the first convincing signs, not after imaging delays [^114dYH1Z] [^114nZHFC]. If available, cerebral oximetry can be used as an adjunct to monitoring, with rcSO2 deviations potentially signaling increased ICP physiology, though evidence is limited and this should not delay empiric hyperosmolar therapy when clinically indicated [^113yUFb9].

> Wait, I need to ensure I am not worsening cerebral edema risk through routine DKA care. I should modify fluids and insulin to avoid rapid osmotic shifts: avoid aggressive early over-resuscitation and adhere to guideline-based isotonic crystalloid rates with correction of the deficit over 24–48 hours, and avoid early insulin boluses; after intravascular volume restoration, use 0.9% saline or balanced crystalloid with careful attention to effective osmolality and add dextrose when plasma glucose falls below about 250 mg/dL so that insulin can continue to clear ketones without precipitating hypoglycemia; in euglycemic DKA, start dextrose-containing fluids earlier alongside insulin to enable ketoacid clearance while preventing hypoglycemia, which is especially relevant in SGLT2-associated presentations [^112YtsdG] [^116vxCdp] [^113aX4rv] [^114nZHFC].

> Let me reconsider insulin strategy because dosing details matter for both safety and efficacy. I should confirm that continuous insulin is initiated after initial fluids when potassium is adequate, generally at 0.05–0.1 units/kg/h IV, avoiding an IV insulin bolus which may increase cerebral edema risk; as glucose approaches 200–250 mg/dL, I should reduce the insulin rate to about 0.05 units/kg/h and add dextrose to maintain glucose around 200–250 mg/dL until ketonemia resolves; for mild DKA, subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin protocols are acceptable in selected patients, but in the setting of concerning neurologic symptoms I favor IV infusion for tighter titration and monitoring [^117Lu9uo] [^115LGzuF] [^114nZHFC].

> I should double-check potassium and electrolytes, because cerebral complications can be compounded by dyskalemias and other derangements. Potassium replacement requires established urine output and frequent checks; if potassium is below 3.5 mmol/L, replacement should precede insulin to avoid life-threatening hypokalemia, whereas 3.5–5.0 mmol/L warrants adding potassium to IV fluids to target 4–5 mmol/L, and levels above 5.0 mmol/L allow insulin to proceed while monitoring potassium closely; I also need to monitor sodium, phosphate, and osmolality every 2–4 hours during active treatment, adjusting therapy to avoid rapid shifts [^1135r4eb] [^1164uV6V].

> But wait, what if the headache persists despite appropriate metabolic correction and no clear signs of cerebral edema, or if focal findings emerge. I need to check for alternative intracranial pathology with a non-contrast head CT urgently in severe or focal presentations, because DKA-related cerebral edema can unmask or coexist with lesions such as subdural collections, and neurosurgical consultation may be required if mass effect or hemorrhage is identified; this step should proceed in parallel with ongoing DKA care and neuroprotective measures [^116M3Pj4] [^114nZHFC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to routine analgesics too early. I should confirm that serious causes are excluded or treated before considering symptomatic therapy for headache; once neurologic status stabilizes, imaging is reassuring, and metabolic derangements are improving, acetaminophen can be used judiciously, while NSAIDs are best avoided in dehydration or renal compromise common in DKA, and there is no evidence base for headache-specific agents altering outcomes in DKA, so the focus must remain on correcting the underlying metabolic and cerebral physiology [^114nFLve] [^1117ZCKL].

> Next, I should review the monitoring cadence because early detection of neurologic deterioration alters outcomes. I will ensure frequent neurologic checks every 1–2 hours during the acute phase, continuous vital sign monitoring, and laboratory reassessment of electrolytes, osmolality, beta-hydroxybutyrate, venous pH, and glucose every 2–4 hours until stability is achieved, with nursing teams tracking strict input and output; rapid escalation is warranted for any GCS decline, new vomiting, or bradycardia suggesting rising intracranial pressure [^1164uV6V] [^113KospR] [^11327pwX].

> I need to ensure a safe transition once DKA resolves. Resolution typically requires pH greater than 7.3, bicarbonate above 15 mmol/L, and anion gap closure with clinical improvement; at that point, I should initiate a scheduled subcutaneous basal-bolus regimen while continuing IV insulin for 1–2 hours to prevent rebound hyperglycemia and reaccumulation of ketones, documenting stable neurologic status before de-escalating the intensified monitoring protocol [^1164uV6V] [^111B6tzY].

> Finally, I should confirm prevention counseling to reduce future risk, because recurrent DKA increases morbidity and the risk of cerebral complications. Sick-day management with frequent glucose and ketone checks, supplemental insulin, hydration, and early contact with the care team should be reinforced; patients on or at risk for SGLT2 inhibitor–associated euglycemic DKA need education about ketone monitoring and early recognition of symptoms even with normal glucose values; discharge planning should include addressing precipitating causes and ensuring follow-up and supplies for ketone measurement [^113WH2mv] [^111E5Rxi] [^1117ZCKL].

> Key takeaways I should verify and leave clearly: do not treat headache in DKA as benign, because it may herald cerebral edema; initiate hyperosmolar therapy promptly when suspected and adjust fluids and insulin to avoid rapid osmotic shifts; continue definitive DKA management with meticulous electrolyte and neurologic monitoring; obtain neuroimaging when headache is severe, focal, or persistent to exclude other intracranial pathology; and use analgesics only after stabilization, as there is no evidence for headache-specific pharmacotherapy altering outcomes in DKA, with the priority remaining on correcting the underlying metabolic and cerebral processes [^114nZHFC] [^114dYH1Z] [^112YtsdG] [^114nFLve].

Headache in DKA is best managed by **treating the underlying metabolic derangements** with standard DKA care [^1117ZCKL]: isotonic IV fluids [^112YtsdG], insulin, and electrolyte replacement [^1135r4eb] [^113aX4rv], while monitoring for cerebral edema [^114nZHFC]. Use **acetaminophen as the first-line analgesic** if needed, and avoid NSAIDs due to renal risk and aspirin because of bleeding risk. If headache worsens or is accompanied by altered mental status, vomiting, or focal deficits, urgently evaluate for cerebral edema [^114dYH1Z] and initiate hyperosmolar therapy (mannitol or hypertonic saline) [^113yUFb9] and neurology consultation. Routine opioids and triptans are not recommended; address precipitating causes [^1117ZCKL] and provide patient education to prevent recurrence [^111e8adi].

## Pathophysiology of headache in DKA

Headache in DKA is multifactorial, driven by **metabolic derangements** and dehydration:

- **Metabolic acidosis**: Low pH and bicarbonate cause cerebral vasodilation and increased intracranial pressure, leading to headache [^114nFLve].
- **Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance**: Osmotic diuresis causes volume depletion and electrolyte shifts, contributing to headache [^116vxCdp].
- **Hyperglycemia and ketosis**: Elevated glucose and ketones increase osmolarity and cerebral irritation, causing headache [^116cQgcP].
- **Cerebral edema**: A rare but severe complication, more common in children, presenting with headache, altered mental status, and neurological deficits [^114dYH1Z] [^113yUFb9].

---

## Initial assessment and monitoring

Structured initial **assessment and monitoring** are essential to guide therapy and detect complications early. Perform a neurological assessment to evaluate headache severity, mental status, focal deficits, and signs of increased intracranial pressure [^114nFLve]. Check serum electrolytes, renal function, venous pH, osmolality, and glucose every 2–4 hours until stable [^1164uV6V] [^113KospR], and closely monitor blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation.

---

## General management of DKA

Effective headache relief in DKA depends on **correcting metabolic derangements** [^114nFLve]:

- **Fluid resuscitation**: Start isotonic saline or balanced crystalloids [^116vxCdp] at 500–1,000 mL/h for the first 2–4 hours [^112YtsdG], then adjust to correct deficits over 24–48 hours.
- **Insulin therapy**: Begin IV insulin at 0.1 units/kg/h [^117Lu9uo]; reduce to 0.05 units/kg/h when glucose reaches 250 mg/dL to prevent hypoglycemia [^115LGzuF].
- **Electrolyte replacement**: Replace potassium based on serum levels and renal function [^1135r4eb]; add dextrose when glucose falls below 250 mg/dL to allow continued insulin until ketonemia resolves [^113aX4rv].
- **Identify and treat precipitating causes**: Address infections, medication nonadherence, or other triggers [^1117ZCKL].

## Specific management of headache in DKA

### Pharmacological interventions

Use **acetaminophen (paracetamol) as first-line** therapy for mild to moderate headache, avoiding NSAIDs given renal risk and aspirin due to bleeding risk. Avoid opioids because they can cause sedation and respiratory depression and may mask neurological changes. Triptans are not recommended because of vasoconstrictive effects and potential cardiovascular risks.

---

### Non-pharmacological interventions

Emphasize **hydration, rest, and education**. Adequate fluid resuscitation reduces headache by correcting dehydration and electrolyte imbalances [^112YtsdG]. Provide a quiet, dark environment to reduce sensory stimuli and headache severity. Educate patients to recognize and promptly report worsening headache or neurological symptoms [^113WH2mv].

---

## Management of headache associated with cerebral edema

Cerebral edema is a rare but severe complication requiring **immediate intervention**:

- **Immediate recognition**: Look for headache with altered mental status, vomiting, bradycardia, hypertension, or focal deficits [^114dYH1Z] [^113yUFb9].
- **Hyperosmolar therapy**: Administer mannitol (0.5–1 g/kg IV) or hypertonic saline (3% saline, 2.5–5 mL/kg IV) promptly [^113yUFb9].
- **Neurological consultation**: Obtain urgent neurology or critical care input for ongoing management [^114nFLve].
- **Avoid rapid correction**: Prevent rapid shifts in glucose or osmolality to reduce cerebral edema risk [^114nZHFC].

---

## Prevention of recurrent headache in DKA

Preventing recurrence relies on **patient education** and **structured follow-up** [^113WH2mv]. Education should cover recognition, prevention, and management of DKA and hyperglycemic crises [^111e8adi]. Structured follow-up ensures regular outpatient care and support to maintain glycemic control and prevent recurrence [^114nFLve].

### Emergency department presentations of diabetic ketoacidosis in a large cohort of children [^114dYH1Z]. Pediatric diabetes (2023). High credibility.

Of the 1,679 DKA episodes, 55 (3.3%) received the following treatments for cerebral injury: mannitol 38 (2.3%), hypertonic saline 24 (1.4%), and/or endotracheal intubation 9 (0.5%). After expert case review, 34 (2.0%) of the included DKA episodes were found to meet published criteria for clinically apparent cerebral injury. Eight-one children (5.4% of those with documented GCS scores) had GCS scores < 14 at presentation. Of the 348 DKA episodes for children who reported headaches, 11 (3.2%) received any treatment for cerebral injury. The rate was similar among the 1,331 DKA episodes for children who did not report headaches, in whom 44 (3.3%) received treatment for cerebral injury (p = 1.0). Six (1.7%) DKA episodes with a headache and 28 (2.1%) without a headache met criteria for clinically-apparent cerebral injury (p = 0.83). All but two children (99.9% of study participants) survived to hospital discharge. The two children died from cerebral injury: a 5-year-old with newly diagnosed diabetes (from the FLUID study) and a 12-year-old with previously diagnosed diabetes (from the retrospective cohort).

### Bihemispheric cerebral oximetry monitoring's functionality in suspected cerebral edema diabetic ketoacidosis with therapeutic 3% hyperosmolar therapy in a pediatric emergency department [^113yUFb9]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Low credibility.

Suspected cerebral edema diabetic ketoacidosis (SCEDKA) is more common than perceived, presenting with symptoms including altered mentation, headache with vomiting, depressed Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), abnormal motor or verbal responses, combativeness, and neurological depression. SCEDKA has been associated with the initial presentation of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and at the start of DKA therapy. Cerebral oximetry, which includes bihemispheric regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rcSO2) and cerebral blood volume index (CBVI), can detect increased intracranial pressure (ICP)-induced altered bihemispheric cerebral physiology. In pediatrics, an rcSO2 of less than 60% or greater than 85% reflects increased ICP and cerebral edema.

Cerebral oximetry can detect increased ICP-induced altered bihemispheric cerebral physiology (rcSO2, CBVI) and cerebral physiological changes during therapeutic mechanical cerebral spinal fluid removal to decrease increased ICP. In pediatric intensive care units, SCEDKA patients with non-bihemispheric cerebral oximetry…

### Euglycemic ketoacidosis associated with SGLT-2 inhibitors in non-diabetic patients-a narrative review [^112fCcXR]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Euglycemic ketoacidosis is an acute, life-threatening emergency characterized by euglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and ketonemia. It is a well-recognized adverse event in diabetic patients taking sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2 inhibitors). However, there is limited data on SGLT-2 inhibitor-related euglycemic ketoacidosis in non-diabetic patients.

The mechanism behind SGLT-2 inhibitor-associated euglycemic ketoacidosis involves a general state of starvation or relative insulin deficiency. This exacerbates the mild baseline ketonemia caused by this class of medications while normoglycemia is maintained. The incidence of euglycemic ketoacidosis will likely increase with the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors for various indications beyond diabetes mellitus type 2, predominantly for congestive heart failure (CHF). Recognizing the signs and symptoms of this life-threatening condition is essential for effective treatment.

Our objective is to comprehensively revisit the pathophysiology of euglycemic ketoacidosis associated with SGLT-2 inhibitors and its risk factors. Additionally, we aim to review the available data and summarize reported cases of euglycemic ketoacidosis in non-diabetic patients using SGLT-2 inhibitors. Our literature search identified five articles detailing six cases of euglycemic ketoacidosis in non-diabetic patients on SGLT-2 inhibitors for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The common risk factor in five out of the six cases was decreased oral intake due to acute illness, fasting, or a perioperative state.

### Hyperglycemic emergencies in adults [^116GY5Zs]. Canadian Journal of Diabetes (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetic ketoacidosis, specifically with respect to beta-hydroxybutyrate, the DC 2018 guidelines recommend considering the use of point-of-care capillary β-hydroxybutyrate testing in the hospital or outpatient setting. This testing is used to screen for DKA in patients with T1DM who have capillary blood glucose levels greater than 14 mmol/L.

### Evaluation and management of the critically ill adult with diabetic ketoacidosis [^113gT6Kk]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a hyperglycemic emergency that frequently presents to the emergency department. Severe DKA poses a significant risk for morbidity and mortality if not recognized early and treated appropriately. It is essential for emergency clinicians to remain vigilant in the management of these critically ill patients.
- **Objective**: This narrative review evaluates the emergency medicine management of the adult patient with severe DKA.
- **Discussion**: DKA most commonly occurs in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, often triggered by nonadherence to diabetic medications or an inciting event like infection or ischemia. The severity of DKA is classified based on the level of acidosis rather than the absolute glucose level. Management of severe DKA involves treating the inciting event, providing fluid hydration, insulin, and potassium repletion. Close monitoring is necessary to prevent complications that may arise.
- **Conclusions**: DKA is a medical condition that carries the risk of significant morbidity and mortality if not recognized and managed appropriately.

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis: A potential complication of treatment with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition [^114EzAFr]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are the most recently approved antihyperglycemic medications. We sought to describe their association with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (euDKA) in hopes that it will enhance recognition of this potentially life-threatening complication.
- **Research design and methods**: Cases identified incidentally are described.
- **Results**: We identified 13 episodes of SGLT-2 inhibitor-associated euDKA or ketosis in nine individuals, seven with type 1 diabetes and two with type 2 diabetes, from various practices across the U.S. The absence of significant hyperglycemia in these patients delayed recognition of the emergent nature of the problem by patients and providers.
- **Conclusions**: SGLT-2 inhibitors seem to be associated with euglycemic DKA and ketosis, perhaps as a consequence of their noninsulin-dependent glucose clearance, hyperglucagonemia, and volume depletion. Patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who experience nausea, vomiting, or malaise or develop a metabolic acidosis in the setting of SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy should be promptly evaluated for the presence of urine and/or serum ketones. SGLT-2 inhibitors should only be used with great caution, extensive counseling, and close monitoring in the setting of type 1 diabetes.

### Comparison of clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes between initially diagnosed type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus patients presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis [^113gkmar]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common noncommunicable diseases worldwide. According to global data in 2021, 537 million adults had diabetes. A previous study in Thailand reported an increase in the prevalence of diabetes over the 10-year period from 7.1 to 8.9% in men and 8.3 to 10.8% in women (2004–2014). Many diabetic patients are asymptomatic or have mild hyperglycemic symptoms. However, some patients can present with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) as the first manifestation. According to the 2019 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of diabetes mellitus, there are six types of diabetes that are classified by pathophysiology, clinical characteristics, laboratory investigations, and long-term management.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) results from autoimmune destruction of the beta cells of the pancreas, causing an insulinopenic state in most patients. At diagnosis, between 70 and 90% of children with T1DM have evidence of an immune-mediated process with islet-cell autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD), islet antigen 2 (IA2), or insulin autoantibodies (IAA). T1DM patients usually have a normal or low body mass index (BMI). According to data from the DIAMOND project initiated by the WHO in 1990, the highest incidence of T1DM was among children 10–14 years old. However, in a recent study of 2,844 Thai diabetic patients diagnosed before the age of 30 years, the proportion of type 1 diabetes was only 68.05%, 56.97%, 41.96%, and 27.75% among patients with ages of onset from 10 to < 15, 15 to < 20, 20 to < 25, and 25 to < 30 years, respectively.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^117Lu9uo]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of diabetic ketoacidosis, specifically concerning insulin infusion, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend determining insulin route and dosage based on the severity of the hyperglycemic crisis.
- **Mild DKA**:
	- **Insulin SC**: Administer 0.1 units/kg of a rapid-acting insulin analog as a subcutaneous bolus, followed by 0.1 units/kg every hour or 0.2 units/kg every 2 hours.
	- **Insulin IV**: As an alternative to subcutaneous insulin, a regimen similar to that for moderate-to-severe DKA.
	- Reduce the short-acting insulin dose to 0.1 units/kg subcutaneously every 2 hours when glucose levels reach a specified threshold.
	- Consider administering 0.1 units/kg of short-acting insulin as an IV bolus if there is a delay in setting up the infusion.
	- Reduce the short-acting insulin dose to 0.05 units/kg/h IV or follow a nurse-driven protocol with a variable rate based on glucose values when glucose levels are < 150 mg/dL. Maintain glucose levels within the 200–250 mg/dL range.

### New-onset diabetes and ketoacidosis with atypical antipsychotics [^11129QEH]. Schizophrenia Research (2003). Low credibility.

Information from the Ohio Department of Mental Health (ODMH) database was reviewed retrospectively to identify patients at the Cincinnati center treated with an atypical antipsychotic who had also been evaluated or treated for diabetes mellitus. Blood glucose levels, glucose tolerance, or other evaluations of diabetes had been conducted in 14 of the 126 patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. In 11 of the 14 patients, new-onset, acute, and marked glucose intolerance developed after treatment with clozapine, olanzapine, or quetiapine. Of these, six patients required insulin therapy (four only transiently), and five patients developed diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Glucose metabolism was labile in all cases and was transient in two cases, with subsequent resolution despite ongoing antipsychotic therapy. Certain atypical antipsychotics may be associated with new-onset glucose intolerance, including acute diabetes and ketoacidosis. Monitoring for changes in blood glucose levels in patients taking atypical antipsychotics may be indicated. More systematic study data are clearly needed.

### Severe euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis of multifactorial etiology in a type 2 diabetic patient treated with empagliflozin: case report and literature review [^112yhACj]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors represent one of the latest approved classes of oral medications for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). They can be used alone or in combination with other drugs in these patients. Their mechanism of action involves lowering plasma glucose concentration by inhibiting the reabsorption of glucose in the proximal renal tubule. In 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released an official warning concerning an increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with uncharacteristically mild to moderate glucose elevation, i.e. euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (euDKA), in patients on these agents. This was associated with a number of cases of euDKA reported in patients with T2DM, for whom this class of agents is indicated, but there were also rare reports of serious DKA in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients, where the drug was used off-label.

A review of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database identified 73 cases of ketoacidosis, from March 2013 to May 2015, in patients with T1DM or T2DM treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors. In many of those cases, ketoacidosis was not immediately recognized because of only mild glucose elevation, below what is expected for typical DKA (euglycemic ketoacidosis). In major outcome trials with SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with T2DM (EMPA-REG, CANVAS), the incidence of DKA was rare, ranging between 0.1% and 0.6%, and it was not different between the active and placebo groups. However, in a recently published retrospective cohort study, the incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis in patients treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors was double (hazard ratio, 2.1; 95% [CI], 1.5 to 2.9) compared to that in…

### Guidelines for the management of diabetes-related ketoacidosis (DKA) have been poorly adopted and implemented, resulting in a lack of improvement in outcomes [^1121947P]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Effective management of diabetes-related ketoacidosis (DKA) remains crucial, as current guidelines have not been widely adopted, which has led to a lack of significant improvement in patient outcomes. The implementation of these guidelines is crucial to enhance the management and treatment of DKA effectively. Despite the availability of comprehensive guidelines, their implementation in clinical practice appears to be inconsistent, affecting patient recovery and treatment efficacy.

To improve patient outcomes, it is essential for healthcare practitioners to adhere to established guidelines and engage in continuous education on best practices for managing DKA. Enhanced communication and collaboration within the healthcare team can also aid in the successful application of these guidelines, potentially leading to better patient management strategies and improved outcomes.

### Migraine improvement during short lasting ketogenesis: A proof-of-concept study [^114qXLpU]. European Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Ketogenesis is a physiological phenomenon due to starvation or a ketogenic diet (KD), a drastically restricted carbohydrate dietary regimen that induces lipid metabolism and ketone body synthesis. Two patients, whose migraines disappeared only during, and not outside, cycles of a very-low-calorie KD performed to reduce their weight, were recently observed. To confirm our observation, in a dietitian clinical setting, two parallel groups of migraineurs were studied. One group received a 1-month very-low-calorie KD prescription followed by a 5-month standard low-calorie diet (SD), and the other a 6-month SD.
- **Methods**: Ninety-six overweight female migraineurs were enrolled in a diet clinic and blindly received a KD (n = 45) or an SD (n = 51) prescription. Mean monthly attack frequency, number of days with headaches, and tablet intake were assessed before and at 1, 2, 3, and 6 months after diet initiation.
- **Results**: In the KD group, the baseline attack frequency (2.9 attacks per month), number of days with headaches (5.11 days per month), and tablet intake (4.91 doses per month) were significantly reduced after the first month of diet (respectively 0.71, 0.91, 0.51; overall, KD versus baseline, P < 0.0001). During the transition period (first versus second month), the KD group showed a transient worsening of each clinical headache variable (respectively 2.60, 3.60, 3.07), despite improvement compared with baseline, with continuous improvement up to month 6 (respectively 2.16, 2.78, 3.71). In the SD group, significant decreases in the number of days with headaches and tablet intake were observed.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) induced cerebral edema complicating small chronic subdural hematoma/hygroma at Zewuditu Memorial Hospital: A case report [^116M3Pj4]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Since our patient had both medical and neurosurgical problems, a multidisciplinary team was involved in her management. Accordingly, both medical and neurosurgical treatments were administered by the respective team of physicians.
- **Medical management**: The fluid deficit, potassium deficit, and hyperglycemia were corrected using normal saline, potassium replacement, and regular insulin administration as per diabetic ketoacidosis management protocol. The patient was then monitored hourly for RBS and urine ketones to assess clinical response. After 6 hours of management, the patient became ketone-free, and her hyperglycemia level reduced to 250–300 mg/dl. Despite the metabolic response, her headache persisted and did not improve with medical management.
- **Surgical management**: Once the patient was stabilized metabolically and medically, neurosurgical intervention was decided upon due to the tight brain condition disproportionate to the thickness of the extra-axial collection as detailed in the CT findings. Written informed consent was obtained for her to undergo surgery, and permission was granted for her case summary to be published for educational purposes. The patient was then taken to the operating room and positioned supine. She was given intranasal oxygen, and sedation was achieved with both pethidine and diazepam. The hair was shaved, and local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine was administered at the surgical site. The surgical field was initially cleaned with alcohol and then painted with povidone-iodine. Proper prepping and draping were completed. A 3 cm sized skin incision was made.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^111E5Rxi]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

The American Diabetes Association's (ADA) 2025 guidelines recommend educating patients with diabetes who are at risk for developing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), particularly those following a ketogenic eating pattern and being treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors. Education should focus on the risks and signs of ketoacidosis, methods of risk mitigation management, and providing appropriate tools for accurate ketone measurement, such as serum β-hydroxybutyrate.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis: A current appraisal of pathophysiology and management [^114HVCSn]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a frequent metabolic abnormality observed in high-dependency units such as critical care units and in emergency departments. Understanding its pathophysiology, which is a consequence of absent or low insulin levels, helps clarify the clinical presentation. Most clinical features, such as weight loss, are caused by hyperglycemia and acidosis. The newer management modalities, which include intensive laboratory workup and meticulous monitoring of insulin and fluid management, are discussed. Among the complications, cerebral edema (CE) is the most dreaded, although it has a low incidence rate. New insights into its pathophysiology and management are outlined, and a timeline for the management of DKA is proposed.

### Pediatric non-diabetic ketoacidosis: a case-series report [^116kK37C]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

This study explores the clinical characteristics, laboratory diagnosis, and treatment outcomes in pediatric patients with non-diabetic ketoacidosis.
- **Methods**: Retrospective patient chart review was performed between March 2009 and March 2015. Cases were included if they met the selection criteria for non-diabetic ketoacidosis, which were: 1) Age ≤ 18 years; 2) urine ketone positive ++ or > 8.0 mmol/L; 3) blood ketone > 3.1 mmol/L; 4) acidosis (pH < 7.3) and/or HCO3 < 15 mmol/L; 5) random blood glucose level < 11.1 mmol/L. Patients who met criteria 1, 4, 5, plus either 2 or 3, were defined as non-diabetic ketoacidosis and were included in the report.
- **Results**: Five patients with seven episodes of non-diabetic ketoacidosis were identified. They all presented with dehydration, poor appetite, and Kussmaul breathing. Patients treated with insulin plus glucose supplementation had a quicker recovery from acidosis compared to those treated with bicarbonate infusion and continuous renal replacement therapy. Two patients treated with bicarbonate infusion developed transient coma and seizures during the treatment.
- **Conclusion**: Despite normal or low blood glucose levels, patients with non-diabetic ketoacidosis should receive insulin administration with glucose supplementation to correct ketoacidosis.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Inform patients that bexagliflozin tablets can cause potentially fatal ketoacidosis, particularly in those with type 1 diabetes mellitus and other ketoacidosis-related conditions. Emphasize that individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g. a history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are at increased risk. Educate all patients on precipitating factors, such as insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, infection, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, dehydration, and alcohol abuse. Symptoms of ketoacidosis include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tiredness, and labored breathing. It is crucial to inform patients that blood glucose may be normal even in the presence of ketoacidosis.

Advise patients that monitoring ketones may be necessary. Instruct them to discontinue bexagliflozin tablets and seek medical attention immediately if symptoms of ketoacidosis occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
- **Lower limb amputation**: Inform patients of the potential for an increased risk of amputations with bexagliflozin tablets. Counsel patients on the importance of routine preventive foot care. Instruct patients to monitor for any new pain or tenderness, sores or ulcers, or infections involving the leg or foot, and to seek medical advice immediately if such signs or symptoms develop [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Approach to the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis [^114nZHFC]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a common cause of severe metabolic acidosis, remains a life-threatening condition due to complications of both the disease and its treatment. This Acid-Base and Electrolyte Teaching Case discusses DKA management, emphasizing complications of treatment. Because cerebral edema is the most common cause of mortality and morbidity, especially in children with DKA, we emphasize its pathophysiology and implications for therapy. The risk for cerebral edema may be minimized by avoiding a bolus of insulin, excessive saline resuscitation, and a decrease in effective plasma osmolality early in treatment.

The goal of fluid therapy is to lower muscle venous Pco2 to ensure effective removal of hydrogen ions by bicarbonate buffer in muscle and diminish the binding of hydrogen ions to intracellular proteins in vital organs (such as the brain). In patients with DKA and a relatively low plasma potassium level, insulin administration may cause hypokalemia and cardiac arrhythmias. It is suggested in these cases to temporarily delay insulin administration and first administer potassium chloride intravenously to bring the plasma potassium level close to 4 mmol/L.

Sodium bicarbonate administration in adult patients should be individualized. We suggest it be considered in a subset of patients with moderately severe acidemia (pH < 7.20 and plasma bicarbonate level < 12 mmol/L) who are at risk for worsening acidemia, particularly if hemodynamically unstable. Sodium bicarbonate should not be administered to children with DKA, except if acidemia is very severe and hemodynamic instability is present.

### A fatal outcome of complicated severe diabetic ketoacidosis in a 11-year-old girl [^1114r5FN]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a complex metabolic state characterized by hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and ketonuria. Cerebral edema is the most common rare complication of DKA in children. The objective of the study was to emphasize the importance of careful evaluation and monitoring for signs and symptoms of cerebral edema in all children undergoing treatment for DKA. We present a case of an 11-year-old girl with a history of diabetes mellitus type I (T1DM) who presented with severe DKA complicated by hypovolemic shock, cerebral edema, and hematemesis. Considering the fact that complications of DKA are rare and require a high index of clinical suspicion, early recognition and treatment are crucial for avoiding permanent damage.

### Unusual case of pheochromocytoma presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis [^113w7Rtt]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Pheochromocytoma is a rare catecholamine-secreting tumour arising from chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla or extra-adrenal sympathetic ganglia. It classically presents with paroxysmal headaches, hypertension, palpitations, and sweating related to catecholamine excess. Diabetes is reported to be present in approximately one-third of patients with pheochromocytoma; however, diabetic ketoacidosis is an extremely rare complication.

We present a case of an African-American male aged 30 years who initially presented with diabetic ketoacidosis and hypertensive urgency, whose blood pressure and glycaemic control improved remarkably following tumour excision. We will discuss this unusual presentation of pheochromocytoma along with a management approach for such adrenal incidentalomas.

### Efficacy and safety of exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate for preventive treatment in episodic migraine: A single-centred, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover trial [^116iKbvh]. Cephalalgia (2022). Low credibility.

Several studies propose that brain energy deficit might be partially involved in the pathophysiology of migraine. Previously, studies demonstrated that a ketogenic diet causes a substantial reduction in migraine frequency. Because the ketogenic diet is restrictive and difficult to adhere to, we proposed supplementing ketone bodies exogenously to provide a prophylactic effect in migraineurs.
- **Aim**: To evaluate the prophylactic effect of exogenous DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate supplementation in episodic migraineurs.
- **Methods**: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised crossover trial was conducted, involving 41 patients with episodic migraine. Patients were randomised 1:1 into placebo or beta-hydroxybutyrate group before entering the first treatment period. Each treatment period was 12 weeks long, followed by four weeks of a washout phase and four weeks of a run-in phase before entering into the corresponding second treatment period. The primary endpoint was the number of migraine days in the last four weeks of treatment, adjusted for baseline.
- **Results**: We observed no clinically significant amelioration of migraine frequency or intensity under DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate treatment compared to placebo regarding the number of migraine days (mean difference [95% CI]: -1.1 [-5.07, 2.85]), and migraine intensity (0–10 VAS: 1.5 [-0.8, 3.7]).
- **Conclusion**: The selected dose of supplemented exogenous DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate did not demonstrate efficacy in episodic migraineurs.

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome complicating diabetic ketoacidosis; an important treatable complication [^113Q3ZVT]. Pediatric Diabetes (2017). Low credibility.

Development of acute neurological symptoms secondary to cerebral oedema is well described in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and often has a poor prognosis. We present the clinical and radiological data of a 17-year-old girl who developed cortical blindness, progressive encephalopathy, and seizures caused by posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) that developed after her DKA had resolved. Vasogenic oedema in PRES resolves if the underlying trigger is identified and eliminated. In this case, hypertension was identified as the likely precipitating factor, and following treatment her vision and neurological symptoms rapidly improved. We suggest how recent DKA may have contributed to the development of PRES in this patient.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis [^111itEwi]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2020). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is the most common acute hyperglycemic emergency in people with diabetes mellitus. A diagnosis of DKA is confirmed when all three criteria are present:

- **Elevated blood glucose levels or a family history of diabetes mellitus (D)**: Diagnosis of diabetes is critical in identifying DKA.

- **Presence of high urinary or blood ketoacids (K)**: This criterion indicates the metabolic state of the patient.

- **High anion gap metabolic acidosis (A)**: This confirms the acidosis component of DKA.

Early diagnosis and management are paramount to improve patient outcomes. The mainstays of treatment include the restoration of circulating volume, insulin therapy, electrolyte replacement, and treatment of any underlying precipitating event. Without optimal treatment, DKA remains a condition with appreciable, although largely preventable, morbidity and mortality. In this Primer, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, risk factors, and diagnosis of DKA and provide practical recommendations for the management of DKA in adults and children.

### Glyxambi [^115ayN5W]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue Glyxambi, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting Glyxambi.

Withhold Glyxambi, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume Glyxambi when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct them to discontinue Glyxambi and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.
- **Pancreatitis**: Acute pancreatitis, including fatal pancreatitis, has been reported in patients treated with linagliptin. In the CARMELINA trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3)], acute pancreatitis was reported in 9 (0.3%) patients treated with linagliptin and in 5 (0.1%) patients treated with placebo. Two patients treated with linagliptin in the CARMELINA trial had acute pancreatitis with a fatal outcome. There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal pancreatitis, in patients treated with linagliptin.

Take careful notice of potential signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue Glyxambi and initiate appropriate management.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis in pregnancy [^114R1LXd]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

The clinical presentation of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) includes nausea, vomiting, thirst, polyuria, polydipsia, abdominal pain, tachypnea, and changes in mental status, particularly in severe DKA. The occurrence of DKA is similar in both pregnant and non-pregnant women; however, in pregnant women, it can manifest at lower serum glucose levels, and symptoms may develop more rapidly. Most cases occur in the second or third trimester. DKA leads to a reduction in uteroplacental blood flow due to osmotic diuresis, resulting in metabolic abnormalities such as maternal acidosis, hyperglycemia, and electrolyte imbalance, which cause fetal hypoxemia and acidosis.

In fetuses with mature cardiac activity, the fetal heart rate may exhibit minimal or absent variability, repetitive deceleration, and absence of acceleration. These heart rate abnormalities typically resolve as the DKA resolves, which may take several hours before normalization. In the reported patient case, immediate delivery based on pathological fetal heart rate would have resulted in a preterm birth and jeopardized the maternal clinical condition. However, a holistic clinical approach by the multidisciplinary team led to a normal term delivery five weeks after the initial presentation with DKA; both fetal and maternal outcomes were good.

### Alternative management of diabetic ketoacidosis in a Brazilian pediatric emergency department [^114K1pfj]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a severe metabolic derangement characterized by dehydration, loss of electrolytes, hyperglycemia, hyperketonemia, acidosis, and progressive loss of consciousness. This condition results from severe insulin deficiency combined with the effects of increased levels of counterregulatory hormones such as catecholamines, glucagon, cortisol, and growth hormone. The biochemical criteria for diagnosis include blood glucose levels greater than 200 mg/dL, venous pH less than 7.3, bicarbonate levels below 15 mmol/L, and the presence of ketonuria.

A patient with DKA must be managed in an emergency ward by experienced staff or in an intensive care unit (ICU) to ensure intensive monitoring of vital and neurological signs, as well as the patient's clinical and biochemical response to treatment. DKA treatment guidelines include:

- **Restoration of circulating volume and electrolyte replacement**: This step aims to correct insulin deficiency and resolve metabolic acidosis and ketosis.
- **Reduction of risk of cerebral edema**: Efforts must be made to avoid complications such as hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, and hyperchloremic acidosis.
- **Identification and treatment of precipitating events**

In Brazil, there are limited pediatric ICU beds in public hospitals. As a result, an alternative protocol was designed to abbreviate the time on intravenous infusion lines, facilitating DKA management in general emergency wards. The main differences between this protocol and international guidelines include the cessation of intravenous fluids once oral fluids are well tolerated, with the total deficit being replaced orally. The protocol also specifies replacement of potassium.

### Severe euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis of multifactorial etiology in a type 2 diabetic patient treated with empagliflozin: case report and literature review [^1164iDy2]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are a relatively novel class of oral medications for the treatment of Type 2 DM with a generally acceptable safety profile. However, these agents have been associated with rare events of a serious and potentially life-threatening complication named euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (euDKA). EuDKA is not identical to the typical diabetic ketoacidosis, as it often presents with serious metabolic acidosis but only mild to moderate glucose and anion gap elevation.
- **Case presentation**: We report a case of a 51-year-old female with Type 2 DM treated with an SGLT-2 inhibitor, developing severe metabolic acidosis with only mild blood glucose elevation after routine surgery. A careful evaluation of involved factors led to the diagnosis of euDKA, followed by the cautious application of simple therapeutic measures that resulted in complete restoration of acidosis and glycemic control in less than 48 hours.
- **Conclusions**: Euglycemic ketoacidosis is a rare but serious complication of SGLT-2 inhibitors use, often with a multifactorial etiology. Its atypical presentation requires a high level of awareness by physicians, as early recognition of this complication can quickly and safely restore acid-base balance.

### Cerebral edema during treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis in an adult with new onset diabetes [^114x9CFg]. Neurocritical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) continues to be a medical emergency, in part because of a rare and devastating complication associated with its treatment: cerebral edema. In children, cerebral edema is the principal cause of mortality, but clinically significant cerebral edema in adults is rare.
- **Methods and results**: We report the case of a 27-year-old male (not previously known to be diabetic) who presented with a first episode of DKA, which was complicated by the development of fatal cerebral edema despite medical treatment.
- **Conclusion**: The pathophysiological mechanisms for cerebral edema associated with DKA occurring in children and adults are believed to be similar and are discussed in this report. However, patients who develop cerebral edema may deteriorate rapidly, and experience with successful treatment has been limited.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis with cerebral hemorrhage and alpha coma in an adolescent female [^112ffA8P]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is one of the most common and harmful complications of type 1 diabetes in children. The neurologic morbidities, including seizure activity, motor/sensory deficit, and coma, can be seen secondary to cerebral edema, hemorrhage, or ischemia. Alpha-frequency is a normal 8–13 Hz physiologic electroencephalogram rhythm that is seen most prominently in the occipital region of awake people and is augmented by eye closure. In the comatose patient, alpha-rhythm is not usually seen. Alpha-frequency coma (AC) is a rare finding in comatose patients and is generally associated with a poor prognosis.
- **Case report**: We report an adolescent with severe DKA, intraparenchymal cerebral hemorrhage, and AC, who had a rapid resolution of the neurologic symptoms.
- **Conclusions**: Similar to other reported cases, our case suggests that the prognosis for patients with AC may not always be poor when it is associated with DKA.

### Management of a patient with diabetic ketoacidosis in the emergency department [^114TD7yk]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis is a common problem among known and newly diagnosed diabetic children and adolescents, often leading them to seek care in the emergency department (ED). Technological advances are bringing changes to the outpatient management of diabetes. The ED physician needs to be aware of the new technologies involved in the care of diabetic children and must be comfortable managing patients using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusions.

This article reviews the ED management of diabetic ketoacidosis and its associated complications. It also provides specific recommendations for caring for patients using the continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, serum ketone monitoring, and continuous glucose monitoring.

### Pathophysiology of ketoacidosis in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^117YFLDR]. Diabetic Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Despite an increasing number of reports of ketoacidosis in populations with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the pathophysiology of ketoacidosis in these patients is unclear. We therefore tested the roles of three possible mechanisms: elevated stress hormones, increased free fatty acids (FFA), and suppressed insulin secretion.

Forty-six patients who presented to the Emergency Department with decompensated diabetes (serum glucose > 22.2 mmol/l and/or ketoacid concentrations ≥ 5 mmol/l) had blood sampled prior to insulin therapy. Three groups of subjects were studied: ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes (KPDM2, n = 13) with ketoacidosis, non-ketosis-prone subjects with type 2 diabetes (DM2, n = 15), and ketotic type 1 diabetes (n = 18).

All three groups had similar mean plasma glucose concentrations. The degree of ketoacidosis (plasma ketoacids, bicarbonate, and anion gap) in type 1 and 2 subjects was similar. Mean levels of counterregulatory hormones (glucagon, growth hormone, cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine) and FFA were not significantly different in DM2 and KPDM2 patients. In contrast, plasma C-peptide concentrations were approximately three-fold lower in KPDM2 vs. non-ketotic DM2 subjects (P = 0.0001). Type 1 ketotic subjects had significantly higher growth hormone (P = 0.024) and FFA (P < 0.002) and lower glucagon levels (P < 0.02) than DM2.

At the time of hospital presentation, the predominant mechanism for ketosis in KPDM2 is likely to be greater insulinopenia.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^116vxCdp]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, and more specifically with respect to fluid resuscitation, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend assessing hydration status and administering IV fluids according to the severity of hypovolemia:

- **Mild hypovolemia**: Use 0.9% saline or another balanced crystalloid at a clinically appropriate rate aiming to replace 50% of the estimated fluid deficit in the first 8–12 hours. Add 5% or 10% dextrose to the 0.9% saline/balanced crystalloid when glucose levels reach 200 mg/dL. Start 5% or 10% dextrose alongside 0.9% saline/balanced crystalloid at the start of the insulin treatment in euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (glucose < 200 mg/dL and positive β-hydroxybutyrate).
- **Severe hypovolemia**: Administer 0.9% saline or another balanced crystalloid at a rate of 1.0 L/hr.
- **Cardiac compromise**: Implement hemodynamic monitoring and consider using pressors.

### Alternative management of diabetic ketoacidosis in a Brazilian pediatric emergency department [^11327pwX]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) must be monitored for potential complications, such as hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, cardiac arrhythmia, and venous and arterial thrombotic phenomena. Pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium, and subcutaneous emphysema are more rare. However, cerebral edema is the main cause of DKA-associated mortality.

Cerebral edema may occur in 0.5–1% of all DKA cases in childhood, typically developing 5–15 hours after treatment has started. It is followed by high morbidity rates, with permanent neurological handicap occurring in 10–25% of cases and mortality rates from 20–25%. Risk factors associated with cerebral edema include age under 5 years, recent diabetes mellitus diagnosis, long-standing symptoms, hypocapnia, severe acidosis, bicarbonate treatment for acidosis, excessive volume replacement in the first 4 hours, and insulin administration in the first hour of fluid replacement. Some studies suggest that cerebral edema occurs most frequently and with the greatest severity in children with greater dehydration and hypocapnia.

In a recent review, Glaser highlighted the possible involvement of cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury in causing DKA-related cerebral edema and cerebral injury, suggesting the need to re-examine DKA treatment protocols to determine whether injury could be lessened by optimizing rehydration strategies.

Cerebral edema diagnosis is clinical, and the presence of the following symptoms should alert clinicians to its occurrence: headache, slowing of heart rate, changes in neurologic status (such as irritability and increased drowsiness), urine incontinence, and specific neurological signs.

### Systematic assessment of the quality of research studies of conventional and alternative treatment(s) of primary headache [^116Ws3o5]. Pain Physician (2009). Low credibility.

The diversity of treatments used for headaches and the varied quality of research conduct and reporting make it difficult to accurately assess the literature and to determine the best treatments for patients.

- **Objectives**: To compare the quality of available research evidence describing the effects and outcomes of conventional, complementary, and alternative medicine (CAM) approaches to treating primary (migraine, tension, and/or cluster-type) headache.

- **Study design**: A systematic review of quality research studies of conventional and alternative treatments for primary headache.

- **Methods**: Randomized, controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of treatments for chronic primary headache were searched through MEDLINE, PsycInfo, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and NIH databases (in English, between 1979 to June 2004). Studies were evaluated using standard approaches for assessing and analyzing quality indicators.
- **Results**: A total of 125 studies of conventional treatments and 121 CAM treatments met inclusion criteria. 80% of studies of conventional treatments reported positive effects (p < 0.05), compared to 73% of studies of CAM approaches (chi(2) = 3.798, 1 df, p = 0.051). Overall, the literature addressing the treatment of primary headache received a mean Jadad score of 2.72 out of 5 (SD 1.1). The mean Jadad score for studies of conventional therapeutics was significantly better than for those studies of CAM approaches: 3.21 ± 0.9 vs 2.23 ± 1.1 (t = 7.72, 246 df, mean difference 0.98, p < 0.0005).
- **Conclusions**: Studies of conventional treatments scored higher on reporting quality than studies of CAM approaches.

### Pheochromocytoma presenting as diabetic ketoacidosis [^113uZ21V]. Journal of Diabetes and its Complications (2008). Low credibility.

Pheochromocytoma is a rare form of secondary hypertension and may be potentially lethal if left untreated. The classical symptoms are paroxysmal hypertension, headaches, palpitations, and sweating, which are caused by a sudden catecholamine release. Hyperglycemia is reported in some patients with pheochromocytoma; however, diabetic ketoacidosis is an extremely rare complication of pheochromocytoma, with only four cases reported. We report a case of a young woman with pheochromocytoma manifested as diabetic ketoacidosis.

### Hyperglycemic crises in adults with diabetes: A consensus report [^113aX4rv]. Diabetes Care (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, specifically with respect to fluid resuscitation, ADA 2024 guidelines recommend modifying replacement fluids once the plasma glucose concentration is less than 250 mg/dL (less than 13.9 mmol/L). The fluids should contain 5–10% dextrose in addition to 0.9% sodium chloride to prevent hypoglycemia and allow continued insulin administration until the ketonemia is corrected. This is important as plasma glucose concentrations typically decrease before the resolution of ketoacidosis, which usually happens within 4–8 hours.

The progress of a young woman presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis is described. She was initially managed as if she had a new presentation of type 1 diabetes, but was subsequently diagnosed with acromegaly due to a large pituitary tumor. Following treatment for this condition and relative normalization of growth hormone levels, she was able to stop insulin completely. Subsequently, an oral glucose tolerance test showed no evidence of abnormal glucose tolerance, and she remains non-diabetic.

### Recurrent diabetic ketoacidosis and a brief history of brittle diabetes research: Contemporary and past evidence in diabetic ketoacidosis research including mortality, mental health and prevention [^115EcHRB]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Pharmacological, technological, and educational approaches have advanced the treatment of Type 1 diabetes in the last four decades, yet diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) continues to be a leading cause of admission in Type 1 diabetes. This article begins by reviewing contemporary epidemiological evidence on DKA. It highlights a rise in DKA episodes over the last two decades, with DKA continuing to be the leading cause of death among young people with Type 1 diabetes. DKA episodes are also a marker for subsequent all-cause mortality. Additionally, the article summarizes the limited evidence base for DKA prevention and its associations with psychopathology.
- **Historical context**: To emphasize the importance of this high-risk group and the oversight in the past two decades, the article summarizes research literature on recurrent DKA (reDKA) from 1976–1991, when it was extensively investigated as part of the phenomenon of 'brittle diabetes'. During this period, numerous basic science studies investigated the pathophysiology of reDKA.
- **Research findings**: Subsequently, research centers published their experiences of brittle diabetes research participants manipulating their treatment under research conditions. Unfortunately, the driver for this behavior and whether it indicated broader trends among people with ketoacidosis was not pursued.

In summary, we suggest there has been a stasis in the approach to reDKA prevention, potentially linked to historical instances of mass sabotage in brittle diabetes research. Further investigation is required to clarify possible psychological characteristics and motivations behind this behavior.

### An 18-year prospective study of pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis: An approach to minimizing the risk of brain herniation during treatment [^114oeccr]. Pediatric Diabetes (2007). Low credibility.

During the late 1900s, raised intracranial pressure (ICP) during the treatment of pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) emerged as the most important cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric DKA. The contribution of fluid and electrolyte therapy to neurologic deterioration during treatment remains controversial.
- **Methods**: We proposed a physiologic approach to the treatment of DKA, incorporating the principles of rehydration of hypertonic states. Consecutive episodes of pediatric DKA were managed using continuous intravenous insulin and an individualized assessment of the degree of dehydration. Rehydration solutions of tonicity approximating that of the patient were used. Gradual replacement of the volume of deficit after correction of shock, if present, was planned over 48 hours with special attention to changes in effective osmolality, along with intensive cardiorespiratory, neurologic, and biochemical monitoring. Mannitol was administered for signs or symptoms of raised ICP.
- **Results**: Six hundred and thirty-five consecutive episodes of pediatric DKA were treated from January 1988 to September 2005. Means ± standard deviation (SD) for initial measured concentrations of total carbon dioxide, glucose, and urea nitrogen were 7.8 ± 3.3 mmol/L, 602 ± 271 mg/dL (33.4 ± 15 mmol/L), and 21 ± 1 mg/dL (7.4 ± 3.6 mmol/L), respectively. Pretreatment blood gases were available for 477 episodes. The mean initial partial pressures of arterial and venous carbon dioxide ± SD were 16.8 ± 7 mmHg (kP(a)CO(2) = 2.24 ± 0.93) for n = 308 and 26.6 ± 7 mmHg (kP(v)CO(2) = 3.54 ± 0.93).

### Inpefa [^112WAsUA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, Inpefa significantly increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening event, beyond the background rate. In placebo-controlled trials of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the risk of ketoacidosis was markedly increased in patients who received sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors compared to those who received a placebo; this risk may be greater with higher doses of Inpefa. Inpefa is not indicated for glycemic control.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g. history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are also risk factors for ketoacidosis. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes using SGLT2 inhibitors.

Precipitating conditions for diabetic ketoacidosis or other ketoacidosis include acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, insulin dose reduction, volume depletion, and alcohol abuse.

Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g. less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for three days after discontinuing Inpefa.

### Pediatric non-diabetic ketoacidosis: a case-series report [^111aifPj]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

In this case-series report, we analyzed 7 episodes of pediatric non-diabetic ketoacidosis. The treatment approach to correct metabolic disorders in children with non-diabetic ketoacidosis is discussed.
- **Diagnosis of pediatric non-diabetic ketoacidosis**: The diagnosis of ketoacidosis is based on laboratory tests. Normal or low blood glucose levels, low bicarbonates, high anion gap metabolic acidosis, and ketone bodies in blood or urine are consistent with the diagnosis of non-diabetic ketoacidosis. After stabilization of patients, further investigations are mandated for determining the underlying cause of non-diabetic ketoacidosis. The causes include severe starvation, organic acidemia (such as β-ketothiolase deficiency, propionic acidemia, methylmalonic acidemia, and hyperglycinemia), glycogen storage disease, and gluconeogenesis disorders. One child in our case series had a genetic mutation in the T2 gene and was diagnosed with β-ketothiolase deficiency. Patients with this disorder can have impaired ketone metabolism and ketone accumulation in the body.
- **Treatment for pediatric non-diabetic ketoacidosis**: Non-diabetic ketoacidosis is treated similarly to diabetic ketoacidosis, but it also requires some unique approaches. The treatment approach mainly consists of the following four components:

	- **Early glucose supplementation**: The characteristics of diabetic ketoacidosis include high blood glucose, ketone accumulation, and acidosis. The high blood glucose is due to insulin deficiency or insulin resistance.

### Alternative management of diabetic ketoacidosis in a Brazilian pediatric emergency department [^111eFJBg]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Hypertonicity provokes an osmotic flux of water from the intracellular to the extracellular compartment, and nearly all body cells (except for neurons) undergo intracellular dehydration. This water shift generates an extracellular efflux of potassium, further aggravated by metabolic acidosis, causing a high intracellular potassium deficit. The total-body potassium deficit mainly results from vomiting and osmotic diuresis; however, despite the total depletion, serum potassium levels at diagnosis may be increased, normal, or decreased.

Hyperglycemia is the determining factor of serum hyperosmolality, responsible for the osmotic flux of water to the extracellular space, which may cause dilutional hyponatremia. It is estimated that for each 100 mg/dL blood glucose concentration above the limit of 100 mg/dL, there is a 1.6 mEq/L reduction in serum sodium. In general, total-body phosphate depletion is also related to osmotic diuresis, and an accentuated fall in its serum levels is observed after starting insulin replacement, which provokes a rapid intracellular shift of phosphate.

Dehydration, hyperosmolality, acidosis, and electrolytic disorders lead to the release of counterregulatory hormones, perpetuating the decompensation cycle.

In severe cases of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hyperpnea may cause very low pCO2 and, consequently, there will be a decrease in CO2 levels.

### Does a ketogenic diet have a place within diabetes clinical practice? Review of current evidence and controversies [^113a1cmF]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Low credibility.

Despite the abundance of promising short-term evidence supporting the use of ketogenic diets for diabetes management, especially for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), there is still a paucity of research supporting their long-term efficacy and safety across various cohorts to broadly recommend this approach at a population level. It is important to note that this challenge is common to all dietary approaches for diabetes management due to logistic problems in conducting long-term studies. A significant limiting factor of ketogenic diets is the lack of adherence and non-compliance, which contributes to the lack of long-term studies in diabetes management. However, it has been shown that adherence can improve through the intervention of psychological support and reinforcement of mindful eating and other behavioral adherence strategies.

A study highlights the importance of adequate lifestyle support from healthcare professionals when individuals initiate a ketogenic diet to improve diabetes management. There is an observed increase in non-adherence and dropout rates when lifestyle support is discontinued. The social impact of reducing a main source of food for many is a major contributor to non-adherence, as social events often involve consuming carbohydrate-rich food.

Non-adherence may also be attributable to side effects experienced from ketogenic diets, a temporary experience so common that it has been coined "keto flu". This phenomenon primarily includes neurological symptoms such as headache, brain fog, and dizziness, along with gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and constipation.

### Brain tissue oxygenation-guided management of diabetic ketoacidosis induced cerebral edema [^115NeBoA]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus is the most common chronic disease of childhood. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a well-known complication of diabetes mellitus and can be associated with devastating cerebral edema, resulting in severe long-term neurologic disability. Despite the significant morbidity and mortality associated with this condition, relatively few treatments are recommended for these patients. The authors present two patients in which they used both intracranial pressure and brain tissue oxygenation monitoring to manage diabetic ketoacidosis-associated cerebral edema with favorable neurologic outcomes.
- **Setting**: Pediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary care teaching hospital.
- **Interventions**: Two children presented to the emergency room with vague complaints and were found to have diabetic ketoacidosis. During treatment, both patients became comatose, with head computed tomography scans revealing diffuse cerebral edema and herniation syndrome. Intracranial pressure and brain tissue oxygenation monitors were placed to guide therapy.
- **Results**: Multiple episodes of brain tissue hypoxia were noted in both patients. Intracranial pressure control with intubation, sedation, and hyperosmolar therapy improved episodes of decreased brain tissue oxygenation associated with intracranial hypertension. Brain tissue oxygenation was also noted to be significantly less than the target value on several occasions, even when intracranial pressure was controlled and an age-appropriate cerebral perfusion pressure goal was met. Augmentation of cerebral perfusion pressure above age-appropriate levels was considered.

### Migraine and type 2 diabetes; is there any association [^114Vcvnb]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) influences all ages, and its prevalence is increasing worldwide. This disease is correlated with an enhanced risk of several other chronic disorders and causes multiple complications such as diabetic neuropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular disorders. Among the complications related to diabetes mellitus, the association between migraine and diabetes is controversial. Migraine is a neurovascular disorder with complex pathophysiology and recurrent headache attacks. The duration of a migraine headache is 4 to 72 hours and is usually accompanied by nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to sound, light, or motion.

Migraine is associated with an extensive range of subtypes, multiple comorbidities, and a variable prognosis, and it has been better investigated than other types of headaches. A World Health Organization (WHO) review of global data identified migraine as one of the most common health disorders worldwide and the most prevalent reason for headache consultation in America, South-East Asia, Europe, and the Western Pacific. The cause of migraine is unknown, and several studies have shown that genetic and environmental factors are significant pathophysiologic causes of migraine.

Since migraine is a complex disease with several contributing factors, numerous studies have been conducted to discover its predisposing factors. Hypoglycemia and fasting, commonly seen in diabetic patients, are among these factors. Therefore, we compared the prevalence of migraine in diabetic and non-diabetic individuals and evaluated the relationship between migraine and some factors.

### Lactation ketoacidosis: Case presentation and literature review [^111ggN3K]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 35-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 2-day history of malaise and headache. She was breastfeeding her 5-month-old infant and had recently started an altered diet based on reducing carbohydrate intake. Moreover, she had also begun exercising 2 weeks prior to her illness. Initial blood tests revealed high anion gap metabolic acidosis and hypoglycemia: pH 7.13 (normal 7.30–7.40), bicarbonate 9.4 mmol/L (normal 21.0–28.0), anion gap 22.6 mmol/L (normal 8–12), glucose 2.9 mmol/L (normal fasting 3.9–5.8), and ketones 6.4 mmol/L (normal < 0.6). The patient was treated with intravenous dextrose and showed complete resolution of ketoacidosis and hypoglycemia within 48 hours. She was discharged home and remained well with a balanced diet. After excluding all other causes of hypoglycemia and ketoacidosis, the diagnosis of lactation ketoacidosis was made and was considered to be triggered by an altered diet, exercise, and skipping meals. All 11 cases of lactation ketoacidosis previously published are reviewed as well.

### Treatment approaches to maximizing therapeutic response in migraine [^111VS4zm]. Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Migraine is a chronic condition that presents with episodic disabling attacks, which can respond unpredictably to therapies. Studies support early treatment intervention strategies as part of the routine clinical care of migraine patients. Identifying illness severity and stratifying treatment accordingly, as in other diseases such as asthma, diabetes, or hypertension, improves patient outcomes. Assessing the presence of any coexisting conditions, such as depression or anxiety, is another essential part of managing migraine.

### Farxiga [^1147X3RR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and other ketoacidosis**: In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, Farxiga significantly increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening event, beyond the background rate. In placebo-controlled trials of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the risk of ketoacidosis was markedly increased in patients who received sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors compared to patients who received placebo. Farxiga is not indicated for glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g. history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are also risk factors for ketoacidosis. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using SGLT2 inhibitors, including Farxiga.

Precipitating conditions for diabetic ketoacidosis or other ketoacidosis include under-insulinization due to insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, volume depletion, and alcohol abuse.

Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g. less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for 3 days after discontinuing Farxiga.

### Tricaprilin (CER-0001) for the preventive treatment of migraine: A phase 2 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study [^112kVTyi]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2024). High credibility.

Increasing evidence indicates a metabolic etiology for migraines, with ketosis potentially rectifying metabolic and clinical features. We conducted a pilot study to evaluate CER-0001, a ketogenic agent, for migraine prevention without dietary changes.
- **Methods**: This was a 2-part, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study conducted in Australia. Adults with at least a 1-year history of migraine and ≥ 1 prior preventive treatment failure were randomised to either oral CER-0001 (up to 30 g twice a day) or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was Month 3 change in Migraine Headache Days from baseline.
- **Results**: Part 1 results are presented. 81 participants were randomised and dosed (n = 40 CER-0001, n = 41 placebo), and 61 participants had evaluable efficacy data. No statistically significant difference was observed in the primary endpoint (LSMean difference 0.92 days; p = 0.586). During Month 2, a mean improvement of -2.8 days was observed for CER-0001 (p = 0.056). Withdrawal rates were 45.0% and 53.7% (CER-0001; placebo). The proportion of participants reporting at least one treatment-emergent adverse event was similar between arms (90.0% CER-0001, 82.9% placebo), mostly gastrointestinal (85.0% CER-0001, 70.7% placebo).
- **Conclusion**: Results suggest positive directional promise over 2–3 months for CER-0001. A new formulation will be used for larger, fully powered phase 2/3 studies.

### Clinical profile of diabetic ketoacidosis: A prospective study in a tertiary care hospital [^113PehAx]. Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research (2015). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis can be associated with numerous factors, including alcohol consumption, hypotension, altered mental status, decreased serum magnesium, and increased urine glucose. It also involves a higher serum osmolal gap, elevated serum potassium and sodium levels, and decreased serum bicarbonate. Patients may experience abdominal pain, tachycardia, altered consciousness leading to coma, elevated blood glucose levels, and symptoms such as tachypnea, weight loss, increased appetite, and nausea.

The condition can also result in increased urine ketones, vomiting, dyspnea, polyuria, elevated serum ketones, and diabetes mellitus, along with an increase in serum β-hydroxybutyrate. Other signs include elevated HbA1c levels, metabolic acidosis, confusion, fainting, an increase in thirst and fatigue, fruity breath odor, and the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors. The situation is further compounded by visual disturbances, poorly controlled diabetes, raised serum phosphate, lethargy, dehydration, polydipsia, and somnolence.

### Hyperglycemic crises in adults with diabetes: A consensus report [^112YtsdG]. Diabetes Care (2024). High credibility.

The ADA 2024 guidelines recommend the administration of isotonic saline or balanced crystalloid solutions at an initial rate of 500–1,000 mL/h during the first 2–4 hours in adult patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, assuming no renal or cardiac compromise. Following the restoration of intravascular volume, the subsequent choice for fluid replacement should be guided by hydration status. This is assessed using blood pressure, heart rate, fluid input-output balance, and sodium concentration, with the aim to correct estimated fluid deficits within the first 24–48 hours. Caution is advised when rapidly replacing fluids, particularly in patients at high risk of fluid overload. This includes older adults, pregnant individuals, and patients with heart or kidney disease or other serious comorbidities.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^1164uV6V]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding inpatient care for diabetic ketoacidosis, particularly in terms of inpatient monitoring, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend monitoring serum electrolytes, renal function, venous pH, osmolality, and glucose every 2–4 hours until stability is achieved. A subcutaneous multi-dose insulin plan should be initiated after the resolution of DKA or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state when the patient is able to eat and drink. It is advised to continue intravenous insulin infusion for 1–2 hours after transitioning from intravenous to maintenance subcutaneous insulin.
