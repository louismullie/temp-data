## Question

What are the specific recommendations for the management of snakebite provided by the ACMT expert consensus?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the specific recommendations for the management of snakebite provided by the ACMT expert consensus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial assessment and stabilization priorities. Then, I should verify first aid and prehospital care principles. Next, I will examine indications for antivenom, dosing, and administration, including pediatric considerations. After that, I need to check supportive care, monitoring, and escalation triggers. I will then review special populations and high-risk scenarios, followed by discharge planning and follow-up. Finally, I should consider regional variations, controversies, and quality improvement themes, and close with a concise synthesis that aligns with major guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the initial assessment priorities and stabilization approach, because delays here drive morbidity and mortality. I need to ensure airway, breathing, and circulation are secured, anticipate neurotoxicity with respiratory failure, and treat shock promptly with fluids and vasopressors as needed, while avoiding central lines or arterial punctures until coagulopathy is excluded or corrected to limit bleeding risk [^112wEDca] [^116kdRX9]. Hold on, I should verify the bedside coagulation test: the 20-minute whole blood clotting test is a simple, reliable screen for venom-induced coagulopathy and should be repeated if initially negative because coagulopathy can evolve over time, which guides both antivenom decisions and procedural risk [^1151nyLU] [^112wEDca]. I need to check that we document the leading edge of swelling and serial limb measurements every 15–30 minutes until stabilized to track progression and guide escalation decisions [^116a3Fgr].

> Next, I should review first aid and prehospital care, and I must be careful not to conflate regional practices. Immobilize the bitten limb and the patient to slow lymphatic spread, remove constricting jewelry, and arrange rapid transport to a facility with antivenom and critical care capability; minimize exertion because walking increases systemic absorption of venom from pit viper bites [^1139L4ef] [^115hWaqN]. Wait, let me verify pressure immobilization: it is controversial outside neurotoxic elapid contexts and is not recommended for North American pit viper bites due to uncertain benefit and potential harm; tourniquets are harmful and should not be used, and incision or suction is ineffective and may worsen injury, so I should avoid those harmful practices [^1174RKEu] [^1139L4ef]. I should double-check that we contact the receiving hospital early and coordinate with poison control to expedite antivenom availability and specialist input during transport [^114rt9Ub].

> I will now examine indications for antivenom, because timing and thresholds matter. Antivenom is indicated for systemic envenomation (shock, uncontrolled bleeding, neurotoxicity, acute kidney injury), rapidly progressive local swelling, and bites to high-risk anatomical sites such as hands, face, or joints where tissue loss risk is high; early administration limits progression of coagulopathy, neurotoxicity, myotoxicity, and local necrosis, though it does not reliably reverse established tissue injury or AKI [^111vseKs] [^1169iab9]. Hold on, I should verify that we also consider antivenom in moderate envenomation with evolving local effects or hematologic abnormalities even without overt systemic toxicity, as progression can be unpredictable [^111tptgj].

> Let me think about antivenom selection and dosing, and I need to ensure I align with regional products and protocols. Robust dose data are limited; clinicians should follow national or regional protocols rather than relying solely on manufacturer inserts, which can be unreliable, and dosing is the same for adults and children by weight or vial count depending on product and protocol [^111vseKs]. For North American crotalid envenomation, WMS suggests 4–18 vials of Crotalidae polyvalent immune Fab to achieve initial control, with repeat dosing guided by clinical and laboratory response; I should confirm that we reassess at 1–2 hour intervals and repeat antivenom if bleeding persists, neurotoxicity or hemodynamics worsen, or the 20WBCT remains abnormal at 6 hours [^1115bEyb] [^111vseKs]. But wait, what if the patient is a child? Pediatric dosing is weight-based with the same vial-per-kilogram schema as adults for most products, and I should avoid underdosing given similar venom burden per kilogram in severe cases [^111vseKs].

> Next, I should review administration technique and premedication, and I need to check current allergy prevention guidance. Administer antivenom intravenously, either as a diluted infusion over 10–60 minutes or as a slow bolus depending on product and protocol, with resuscitation equipment at the bedside; premedication with antihistamines and corticosteroids is commonly practiced but evidence is limited, whereas prophylactic subcutaneous epinephrine reduces early reactions and is increasingly recommended in some settings, so I should align with local policy and patient risk profile [^111vseKs] [^113FPbXU]. Hold on, I should verify that we monitor closely for anaphylaxis and pyrogenic reactions in the first 1–2 hours, treat promptly with intramuscular epinephrine, and be prepared to pause and resume antivenom cautiously if reactions occur [^1116aMRU].

> I need to ensure supportive care is comprehensive and evidence-aligned. Maintain strict bed rest with limb elevation, provide opioid analgesia, and avoid NSAIDs or aspirin due to bleeding risk; tetanus immunization should be updated after coagulopathy is corrected to minimize injection-site bleeding, and large tense bullae may be aspirated to prevent rupture and infection [^112XWbvk] [^114Kng4W] [^114Zhu3h]. Let me verify fluid and renal strategies: use isotonic crystalloids for shock, avoid over-resuscitation, and manage rhabdomyolysis with aggressive hydration, urine alkalinization when indicated, and dialysis for renal failure; fasciotomy is rarely indicated because compartment pressures are often normal despite severe swelling, so objective compartment pressure measurement should guide any surgical decision [^111VjsEm] [^114Zhu3h]. I should confirm that we monitor for recurrent coagulopathy after Fab antivenom and consider repeat dosing over at least 18 hours in at-risk patients to prevent late bleeding complications [^113fXvGk].

> Now, I should review monitoring and escalation triggers, and I need to check the cadence of reassessment. Continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring is warranted in moderate-to-severe cases, with serial 20WBCT, CBC, coagulation profile, renal function, and CK tracked every 6–12 hours initially; repeat antivenom if local effects progress, bleeding continues, neurotoxicity advances, or coagulopathy fails to correct, and escalate to ICU care for respiratory failure, refractory shock, or renal replacement needs [^112wEDca] [^111vseKs]. Hold on, I should verify that we involve a medical toxicologist or poison control center early for complex cases and coordinate transfers if advanced support is unavailable locally [^112nM5wg].

> Let me consider special populations and high-risk scenarios, and I should double-check pediatric nuances. Children have a lower volume of distribution relative to venom load and can deteriorate rapidly, so I should maintain a lower threshold for antivenom and ICU admission; pregnancy does not contraindicate antivenom, and maternal-fetal outcomes are generally better with timely antivenom and supportive care [^116zNKDJ] [^111vseKs]. For patients on anticoagulants or antiplatelets, I need to anticipate exaggerated bleeding and coordinate reversal strategies when clinically indicated, balancing thrombotic risk against hemorrhagic complications [^11785DX9].

> Next, I should review discharge criteria and follow-up, and I need to ensure we do not miss delayed reactions. Discharge is reasonable after a minimum 24-hour observation if the patient is clinically stable, asymptomatic, and has a persistently negative 20WBCT at 24 hours; minor envenomations may be observed 12–24 hours with repeat labs before discharge, and dry bites require at least 8 hours of observation with repeat assessments [^112jUZaq] [^112pTmM6] [^115utxKy]. I should confirm that patients receive clear return precautions, wound care instructions, and counseling on serum sickness risk; arrange follow-up at about 2 weeks to screen for late reactions and persistent sequelae, and provide prevention education materials [^112jUZaq].

> I will now examine regional variations and controversies, and I must be careful to separate evidence from dogma. In India and parts of Southeast Asia, debates persist over the effectiveness of polyvalent antivenom against non–Big Four species such as Hypnale hypnale, with expert panels emphasizing region-specific antivenoms and cautioning against indiscriminate use of ineffective products; this argues for syndromic management anchored to local epidemiology and venom effects while research on improved antivenoms proceeds [^114PH5Nz] [^1118T12g]. Hold on, I should verify that pressure immobilization remains controversial outside neurotoxic elapid bites and is not recommended for North American pit viper envenomation, whereas some experts in remote settings have discussed tourniquet use as a life-over-limb measure when transport is severely delayed; this remains contested and should not override guideline consensus where timely care is accessible [^1174RKEu] [^115cZSHf]. Let me reconsider the role of expired antivenom: WHO SEARO notes that recently expired products may be used in severe cases if no alternative exists, but clinical safety is uncertain and cloudiness or precipitates are a contraindication, so this remains a last-resort measure with informed consent and legal risk acknowledgment [^114tG1EF].

> Finally, I should synthesize a concise, actionable approach and ensure internal consistency. Stabilize ABCs and treat shock, immobilize and transport expeditiously, avoid harmful first aid, assess severity with serial exams and 20WBCT, administer antivenom early for systemic or progressive local disease using regional protocols, monitor closely for reactions and recurrence, provide supportive care including analgesia, tetanus, and judicious fluids, and observe for at least 24 hours with clear follow-up and education. Escalate care for refractory coagulopathy, respiratory failure, or renal injury, and tailor decisions to species, geography, and patient factors to optimize outcomes [^112wEDca] [^111vseKs] [^1139L4ef].

---

The ACMT expert consensus recommends **rapid transport to a hospital with antivenom** [^1139L4ef] and **early antivenom for systemic or severe local effects** [^111vseKs]. Immobilize the limb [^1139L4ef], avoid tourniquets [^1174RKEu], and do not use pressure immobilization for North American pit vipers [^1174RKEu]. Monitor for progression and coagulopathy with serial exams and labs [^112wEDca]; repeat antivenom if symptoms persist or recur [^113fXvGk]. Provide supportive care (airway, fluids, analgesia) [^112wEDca] and avoid prophylactic antibiotics or fasciotomy unless clearly indicated [^116bCajW]. Discharge only after 24 hours of observation with stable labs and no progression [^112wEDca]; arrange follow-up for delayed reactions and complications [^112jUZaq].

---

## Prehospital and initial management

- **Rapid transport**: Immediate transport to a hospital with antivenom and critical care is essential [^1139L4ef]; minimize exertion to reduce venom spread [^115hWaqN].

- **Immobilization**: Immobilize the bitten limb [^1139L4ef] with a splint; keep the limb at or below heart level.

- **Avoid harmful interventions**: Do not use tourniquets [^1174RKEu], incisions, suction, or ice [^116qPyXd].

- **Pressure immobilization**: Not recommended for North American pit vipers [^1174RKEu]; consider only for neurotoxic envenomations in specific regions [^1139L4ef].

---

## Hospital-based management

### Assessment and monitoring

- **Initial assessment**: Document the time of bite, symptoms, and history; perform a focused exam for local and systemic effects [^11785DX9].

- **Laboratory tests**: Obtain CBC, coagulation profile, fibrinogen, PT/INR, aPTT, CK, renal function, and type and crossmatch [^notfound].

- **Serial monitoring**: Reassess local effects, vital signs, and labs every 4–6 hours [^notfound]; monitor for coagulopathy and progression [^114FGrWo].

---

### Antivenom administration

- **Indications**: Administer antivenom for systemic effects (coagulopathy, neurotoxicity, shock) [^111vseKs] or severe local effects (rapid swelling, compartment syndrome risk) [^111vseKs].

- **Initial dose**: Use 4–6 vials of Crotalidae polyvalent immune Fab (CroFab) for initial control [^notfound]; adjust based on severity and response [^114aHYnG].

- **Repeat dosing**: Repeat every 1–2 hours until clinical control is achieved; monitor for recurrence and retreat as needed [^113fXvGk].

- **Premedication**: Routine premedication is not required; monitor for allergic reactions during infusion [^1116aMRU].

---

### Supportive care

Supportive care includes **airway and breathing** — secure the airway and provide ventilatory support for neurotoxicity or respiratory failure [^112wEDca] — and **circulation**, with intravenous fluids for hemodynamic stability and vasopressors for refractory shock. Pain control should use **opioids** [^112XWbvk]; avoid NSAIDs due to bleeding risk [^112wEDca]. Tetanus prophylaxis should be updated after correcting coagulopathy [^114Kng4W].

---

### Surgical interventions

Surgical interventions should be **conservative**; avoid early debridement or fasciotomy unless clearly indicated [^116bCajW]. For compartment syndrome, objectively confirm elevated pressures before performing fasciotomy [^notfound]. Use antibiotics only for **established infection**; prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended [^114Zhu3h].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Weight-based antivenom dosing; children may require proportionally larger doses due to higher venom-to-mass ratios [^notfound].

- **Pregnant patients**: Antivenom is considered safe and should be administered when indicated [^notfound].

- **Allergic reactions**: Treat anaphylaxis with epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids; resume antivenom cautiously after stabilization [^1116aMRU].

---

## Discharge and follow-up

Discharge criteria require **24 hours of observation** with stable vital signs, no progression of swelling, and stable laboratory results [^112jUZaq]. At discharge, educate patients on signs of delayed reactions, wound care, and when to seek medical attention [^112jUZaq]. Follow-up should be arranged within 1–2 weeks to monitor for serum sickness and other complications [^112jUZaq].

Venom immunotherapy (VIT) in patients treated with beta-blockers (BB) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) — maintenance management and risk evidence — is summarized as follows: Recommendation 33 (CBS) states, "We suggest, in most cases, treatment with BB or ACEI medication need not be changed or discontinued in patients receiving maintenance VIT", with "Strength of Recommendation: Conditional" and "Certainty of Evidence: Moderate". Observational data include that "Systemic symptoms occurred in 12% of the patients receiving a BB and in 11.6% of 138 patients with CVD who were not receiving a BB" and "There was also no difference in the rate of systemic reaction to stings during VIT in patients with CVD who were or were not treated with a BB", although another report "reported a significantly greater severity of sting anaphylaxis in patients receiving a BB (34.6% severe vs 20.7% with no BB; p = 0.024) or an ACEI (42.9% severe vs 20.4% with no ACEI; p = 0.002)". In the largest prospective study, investigators "enrolled 1425 patients with a history of sting anaphylaxis of whom 1342 began VIT" and found "no increased frequency of anaphylaxis to VIT injections or to stings among 138 patients treated with cardiovascular medications… and no increased severity of anaphylaxis to the pre-VIT sting in 388 patients receiving BB and ACEI medications (OR = 1.14; 95% CI, 0.89–1.46; p = 0.29)". The document advises that "Decisions regarding VIT and continuing cardiovascular medications should occur in the context of shared decision-making" and notes it "is believed to be safer for these patients to remain on an appropriate BB or ACEI medications rather than to discontinue these medications".

### Snake antivenom product guidelines in India: "the devil is in the details" [^111LJboM]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Venomous snakebite continues to exact a tremendous toll in human suffering and mortality in India. Contributing to this problem is the fact that all of the current Indian snake antivenom manufacturers include a great deal of misinformation in the package inserts and guidelines that accompany their products. Examples include erroneous recommendations regarding first aid, misleading information regarding the signs and symptoms to be anticipated after Indian snakebite, and misleading and ambiguous recommendations as to initial dosing and repeat dosing of antivenom. In addition, the significant problem of acute adverse reactions to Indian antivenoms is compounded by a lack of appropriate recommendations regarding prevention, diagnosis, and management of such reactions. It is the intent of this article to point out problems with the current Indian antivenom product guidelines and to encourage these manufacturers to produce new literature to accompany their products based on the best available evidence.

Education into practice

Think about the last time you treated a patient with snakebite. Reflect on the challenges you encountered while diagnosing and treating envenoming. What changes, if any, might you make to your approach next time?
How do you review a snakebite patient as an outpatient discharge? Think about common persisting physical and psychological problems that you might have noticed during review. To what extent was the patient able to share difficulties in returning to routine life? How might you involve the patient in making decisions about long term?

Discussion

The thematic analysis from the Snakebite Life Support workshop underscores the complex interplay of evolving treatment paradigms, clinical challenges, and region-specific needs in snakebite management. Key themes that evolved in the panel included the importance of strengthening peripheral care through structured training, the development of region-specific protocols, and the use of digital solutions for registry establishment, snake identification, safe transportation, and telesupport. Although scientific advancements are progressing rapidly, existing textbooks struggle to keep pace, and physicians rely on outdated material for clinical practice. Repeated conditioning has led to acceptance of myths as realities. This growing recognition of the unique challenges in snakebite management has led to its classification as a neglected tropical disease.

### Family practice international… [^114aJmrH]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Management of Snakebite Although most snakebites are dramatic, the diagnosis may be missed in patients who are unconscious or severely ill or if the bite occurs in the dark or in heavy vegetation. Presenting symptoms may vary from local discomfort to severe headache, muscle pain, neurologic signs and collapse. Rapid enzyme immunoassays are now available to confirm the presence of venom and to identify the most appropriate antivenom. In addition to the laboratory studies necessary to monitor a severely ill patient, clotting studies should be performed and creatinine kinase checked to monitor myolysis, and renal function should be tested. Management of snakebite depends on immediate treatment as soon as a bite is suspected, supportive therapies and appropriate use of antivenom.

Current recommendations emphasize immediate pressure immobilization by tight bandaging of the affected limb with immobilization during transport to the hospital. Premedication with a parenteral antihistamine is recommended before antivenom injection. Causes of Sudden Loss of Vision If sudden vision loss occurs in a patient with a painful red eye, the primary concern is acute angle-closure glaucoma. This condition should be aggressively treated with intravenous acetazolamide and topical timolol to reduce intraocular pressure, and surgery should be considered to prevent recurrence. Management of Phytophotodermatitis The combination of light and furocoumarins from plant sources may cause a severe dermatitis in susceptible patients.

Ultraviolet light activates the naturally occurring furocoumarins that cause phytophotodermatitis, which begins with severe itching followed by the development of edema, erythema and vesiculation. Since oil of bergamot previously was a common ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics, this dermatitis frequently was seen on the neck, face and hands. Management is based on avoiding the sensitizing agent, careful washing after any exposure and treatment of lesions with wet compresses and topical corticosteroids.

### African polyvalent antivenom can maintain pharmacological stability and ability to neutralise murine venom lethality for decades post-expiry: evidence for increasing antivenom shelf life to aid in alleviating chronic shortages [^114tG1EF]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

As described, many studies have demonstrated retained efficacy of expired antivenoms, and it is important to consider whether existing antivenom stocks could be used more efficiently, particularly given the lack of access to these products in low and middle-income settings. Reports suggest that clinicians are already using expired antivenom products due to lack of availability of in-date products, and the South-East Asia regional office WHO guidelines for managing snakebite endorse this in certain circumstances: 'in patients with severe envenoming, recently expired antivenoms may be used if there is no alternative'. However, we must emphasise that while we and others have demonstrated retained preclinical efficacy of expired antivenoms in mouse models, the clinical efficacy and safety of these antivenoms cannot be confirmed from these assays. Expired antivenoms which are cloudy or have precipitates must not be administered due to the likely high risk of adverse reactions resulting from aggregates. The legal implications of prescribing expired antivenom must be emphasised, as the prescribing clinician may subsequently become liable for any adverse events suffered by the patient following administration of an expired antivenom and would need to counsel the patient on the potential risks.

### Vulnerability to snakebite envenoming: a global mapping of hotspots [^113yEw1C]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Snakebite envenoming is a frequently overlooked cause of mortality and morbidity. Data for snake ecology and existing snakebite interventions are scarce, limiting accurate burden estimation initiatives. Low global awareness stunts new interventions, adequate health resources, and available health care. Therefore, we aimed to synthesise currently available data to identify the most vulnerable populations at risk of snakebite, and where additional data to manage this global problem are needed.

Methods

We assembled a list of snake species using WHO guidelines. Where relevant, we obtained expert opinion range (EOR) maps from WHO or the Clinical Toxinology Resources. We also obtained occurrence data for each snake species from a variety of websites, such as VertNet and iNaturalist, using the spocc R package (version 0.7.0). We removed duplicate occurrence data and categorised snakes into three groups: group A (no available EOR map or species occurrence records), group B (EOR map but < 5 species occurrence records), and group C (EOR map and ≥ 5 species occurrence records). For group C species, we did a multivariate environmental similarity analysis using the 2008 WHO EOR maps and newly available evidence. Using these data and the EOR maps, we produced contemporary range maps for medically important venomous snake species at a 5×5 km resolution. We subsequently triangulated these data with three health system metrics (antivenom availability, accessibility to urban centres, and the Healthcare Access and Quality [HAQ] Index) to identify the populations most vulnerable to snakebite morbidity and mortality.

Findings

We provide a map showing the ranges of 278 snake species globally. Although about 6.85 billion people worldwide live within range of areas inhabited by snakes, about 146.70 million live within remote areas lacking quality health-care provisioning. Comparing opposite ends of the HAQ Index, 272.91 million individuals (65.25%) of the population within the lowest decile are at risk of exposure to any snake for which no effective therapy exists compared with 519.46 million individuals (27.79%) within the highest HAQ Index decile, showing a disproportionate coverage in reported antivenom availability. Antivenoms were available for 119 (43%) of 278 snake species evaluated by WHO, while globally 750.19 million (10.95%) of those living within snake ranges live more than 1 h from population centres. In total, we identify about 92.66 million people living within these vulnerable geographies, including many sub-Saharan countries, Indonesia, and other parts of southeast Asia.

Interpretation

Identifying exact populations vulnerable to the most severe outcomes of snakebite envenoming at a subnational level is important for prioritising new data collection and collation, reinforcing envenoming treatment, existing health-care systems, and deploying currently available and future interventions. These maps can guide future research efforts on snakebite envenoming from both ecological and public health perspectives and better target future estimates of the burden of this neglected tropical disease.

### Quality of WHO guidelines on snakebite: the neglect continues [^113NetKF]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Summary box

Snakebite is a major public health problem in many parts of the world.
WHO has readded snakebite to the list of neglected tropical diseases in 2017.
The two WHO guidelines on management of snakebite were appraised and found to have poor quality.
The guidelines had inadequate stakeholder involvement, poor methodological rigour, and competing interests were inadequately managed.
WHO should ensure development of high-quality guidelines on snakebite management in accordance with the WHO's Guideline Review Committee process.

Snakebite remains a major public health challenge in many parts of rural Africa, Asia and South America. Available estimates suggest that there are about 94 000 deaths across the world annually due to snakebites; a conservative estimate as many deaths in low and middle-income countries are not reported. The burden on health systems due to snakebite is much higher than what is indicated by the mortality, because even non-venomous snakebite victims visit healthcare facilities for assessment and the morbidity due to snakebite has been scarcely documented. The social and economic consequences of snakebite are known to be high in communities with high prevalence.

Despite its consequences, snakebite has largely been neglected in global health. The WHO readded snakebite to the list of neglected tropical diseases in 2017 — potentially implying more attention and funding for disease control programmes and treatment access initiatives. Such initiatives and programme planning are informed by recommendations in practice guidelines. WHO guidelines are highly influential in South Asia, South-East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa (countries with high burden of snakebite) where the lack of in-country capacity for guideline development means WHO guidelines are used as it is or are being adapted.

It is, therefore, essential to evaluate the quality of WHO guidelines on snakebite. We identified the latest version of the WHO South East Asia Regional Office (SEARO) guideline (2016)and the WHO Africa Regional Office (AFRO) guideline (2010) by searching the WHO website. Three authors independently appraised the quality of these guidelines using the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II, a validated tool for assessing quality of guidelinesvia the online data management system available in the AGREE TRUST website which blinds the appraisers from each other. The AGREE II has 23 items categorised into six domains and two overall assessment items and is widely used for assessing the quality of guidelines including by the WHO.

### Stinging insect hypersensitivity: a practice parameter update 2016 [^113y1EZQ]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Large local reactions — clinical course and management — are usually IgE mediated, almost always self-limited, and rarely create serious health problems; patients with prior large local reactions often have recurrences, and up to 10% might eventually have a systemic reaction. For patients with large local reactions, it is optional to prescribe injectable epinephrine for use if a systemic reaction occurs in the future, most need only symptomatic care and are not candidates for testing for venom specific IgE or venom immunotherapy (VIT), although increasing evidence shows VIT significantly reduces the size and duration of large local reactions and might be useful in those with frequent unavoidable reactions and detectable venom specific IgE; the decision to give VIT must be weighed against added cost and potential inconvenience. Supportive care can include cold compresses, oral antihistamines, and oral analgesics; although many physicians use oral corticosteroids for large local reactions, definitive proof of efficacy is lacking, and antibiotics are not indicated unless there is clear evidence of secondary infection (eg, fever, chills, or sweats).

### Managing snakebite [^1168sV3K]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

What are the clinical effects of snakebite?

Not all people with a snakebite have clinical symptoms. Often bites are by non-venomous snakes. Sometimes venomous snakes do not inject venom during a bite.

Clinical manifestations vary between species of snakes (see box 1). Some toxins in venom exert local effects such as swelling, blistering, bruising, and necrosis at the bite site. Other toxins can be distributed systemically through lymphatics and blood vessels and act at distant sites. See supplementary text for an overview of important sites and pathophysiology of venom-toxin action. Common systemic effects include bleeding, paralysis, generalised rhabdomyolysis, and acute kidney injury. Venom injection deep into a limb can cause tissue swelling in the tightly constrained space and compromise neurovascular function. This manifests as "acute compartment syndrome".

CP-PED (paediatric snakebite management)

There are no considerable changes in management of paediatric bite in case of antivenom however " smaller volumes of treatment, generally 5–10 ml/kg " for paediatric patients was suggested (PKK). It was also noted that " The response of paediatric patients to treatments or interventions can vary somewhat, and even experienced faculty have limited experience with cases involving newborns and very young " (PKK). Additionally a comment on, " many snakebites happen in school settings " was made noting recent events across India including one death in Wayanad, Kerala.,

CP-RD (regional differences in venom and antivenom potency)

Experts noted significant ' differences in antivenom potency in clinical practice ', emphasising the need for region-specific antivenom production in India. Strategic plans, such as expanding venom centres and implementing policy changes at state and district levels, were discussed as critical for improving antivenom quality.

Theme 3: Debates and controversies in snakebite protocols (DC)

DC-TQ (controversies over tourniquet use)

The use of tourniquets in snakebite management remains highly controversial. " The use of a tourniquet can provide false reassurance to patients and bystanders " (RPC). Training is essential because " when prompt medical care is available, using a tourniquet can often do more harm than good " (FMS). The use of tourniquets, though generally not recommended, was suggested as a tool that can still be considered " in remote areas where delays in receiving medical attention " are expected, " by experts " to " prioritise life over limb " (FMS). The argument that " tourniquet has some role in delaying envenomation " (UB, FMS) was contested by members of the panel (KBM, PKK) and the overarching consensus in national and international guidelines, that the use of tourniquets is not recommended, and the overarching consensus in national and international guidelines, that the use of tourniquets is not recommended, was emphasised by the panellists (MA, PKK). However to date, none of the panellists reported having seen pressure immobilisation applied to patients they have received.

Frostbite hospitalization — triage and setting: Hospital admission and discharge are determined on an individual basis, considering severity of the injury, coexisting injuries, comorbidities, and need for hospital-based interventions (tPA, vasodilators, surgery) or supportive therapy, as well as ease of access to appropriate community medical and nursing support. Significant swelling should prompt evaluation for compartment syndrome and admission for observation. Patients with superficial frostbite can usually be managed as outpatients or with brief inpatient stays followed by wound care instructions, and initially deep frostbite should be managed in an inpatient setting. Recommendation: Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.

### Clinical challenges, controversies, and regional strategies in snakebite care in India [^116Uroz1]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2025). High credibility.

Snakebite envenomation remains a significant public health issue, particularly in southeast Asia, where diverse venomous snake species and resource-limited healthcare settings complicate effective management. This Health Policy employed thematic analysis of a panel discussion involving multidisciplinary experts with over 300 years of combined experience. Four key themes were identified: (i) the evolution of snakebite treatment paradigms, (ii) clinical and procedural challenges, (iii) debates over controversial practices, and (iv) the role of policy and research in improving outcomes. The findings emphasise the need for region-specific antivenoms, enhanced peripheral healthcare capabilities, and evidence-based treatment protocols. This work provides actionable insights to inform health policy, guide targeted training initiatives, and prioritise research on neglected areas in the management of snakebite.

### Photobiomodulation therapy to treat snakebites caused by bothrops atrox… [^115FeQHB]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Antivenom is the only evidence-based treatment available for Bothrops snakebites. 18 In vivo, Bothrops antivenom neutralizes the bleeding and lethality induced by the venom of B atrox. 19 However, the efficacy of antivenom in reducing local tissue damage has been shown to be limited. 20, 21. In in vitro and in vivo studies, photobiomodulation therapy has proved to be a promising supporting tool for treating the local effects induced by snake venoms. 22–24 The biological effects that PBMT provokes in the tissues result in analgesic. This was a double-blind, 2-parallel-arm, 1: 1 allocation ratio, randomized clinical trial to investigate the feasibility of PBMT using LLLT combined with the regular AVT compared to only AVT in the recovery of local inflammatory signs and symptoms and myolysis caused by Bothrops snakebites.

no shock); or severe: life-threatening snakebite, with severe bleeding, hypotension, shock, and/or acute kidney failure. 18 AVT was given 30 minutes after premedication with intravenous hydrocortisone, intravenous cimetidine, and oral dexchlorpheniramine. Before administration, AVT vials were diluted in 100 mL of 0. 9% saline. AVT administration time ranged from 30 to 45 minutes. The primary efficacy outcome was myolysis estimated by the value of creatine kinase 48 hours after admission. Additionally, the time from admission to reduction of creatine kinase activity by 50% was also calculated, in a follow-up of 48 hours. In addition, the literature shows that PBMT is a noninvasive, safe, and painless treatment.

41 In preclinical studies, PBMT showed efficacy in reducing the local effects, such as edema, inflammatory response, pain, and myonecrosis, caused by Bothrops snake venoms27, 28; however, this is the first study, to our knowledge, to examine its use in patients with SBE in a clinical study. In this study, the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of the LLLT was demonstrated in B atrox SBEs in a double-blind, randomized clinical feasibility trial.

### The clinical toxicology recommendations collaborative: purpose, organization, and methodology [^114EHAGa]. Clinical Toxicology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Scientific societies aim to provide a collective voice and unified stance on important issues. The Clinical Toxicology Recommendations Collaborative was formed in 2016 to develop evidence- and consensus-based recommendations for the management of patients exposed to common and/or serious poisonings for which the management is unclear or controversial.

Organization

The Clinical Toxicology Recommendations Collaborative is led jointly by the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology, the Asia Pacific Association of Medical Toxicology, and the European Association of Poison Centres and Clinical Toxicologists. The Governance Committee is chaired by a Past-President of one of these Societies and comprised of the six Presidents and Immediate Past-Presidents of the three Societies. A Steering Committee oversees the process of each project workgroup.

Methodology

The overall process is guided by standards set forth by the Institute of Medicine for developing trustworthy guidelines and the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument. Systematic reviews are produced using the framework set in the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology. Workgroup members jointly review the evidence and prepare statements on which they vote anonymously using a 9-point Likert scale. A two-round modified Delphi method is used to reach a consensus on clinical recommendations using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method. Final recommendations are approved by unanimous consent of the workgroup and are expressed as both levels of evidence and strength of recommendations.

Limitations

The major limitations of the Clinical Toxicology Recommendations Collaborative process centre around the amount and quality of evidence, the assessment of that evidence, and the voting of the panel.

Conclusions

By using a transparent evidence- and consensus-based approach to produce systematic reviews and clinical recommendations, the Clinical Toxicology Recommendations Collaborative aims to create an international framework for clinical toxicology education and decision-making and foster positive change for the benefit of poisoned patients.

### A global core outcome measurement set for snakebite clinical trials [^112wxavX]. The Lancet: Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Snakebite clinical trials have often used heterogeneous outcome measures and there is an urgent need for standardisation. A globally representative group of key stakeholders came together to reach consensus on a globally relevant set of core outcome measurements. Outcome domains and outcome measurement instruments were identified through searching the literature and a systematic review of snakebite clinical trials. Outcome domains were shortlisted by use of a questionnaire and consensus was reached among stakeholders and the patient group through facilitated discussions and voting. Five universal core outcome measures should be included in all future snakebite clinical trials-mortality, WHO disability assessment scale, patient-specific functional scale, acute allergic reaction by Brown criteria, and serum sickness by formal criteria. Additional syndrome-specific core outcome measures should be used depending on the biting species. This core outcome measurement set provides global standardisation, supports the priorities of patients and clinicians, enables meta-analysis, and is appropriate for use in low-income and middle-income settings.

### Clinical challenges, controversies, and regional strategies in snakebite care in India [^117EqXzb]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2025). High credibility.

Conclusion

This Health Policy highlights the complex and multifaceted nature of snakebite management in India, emphasising the need for region-specific protocols, enhanced peripheral care, and ongoing research. The discussion reveals the perceived limitations of current antivenoms, the variability in clinical practices, and the importance of accurate snake identification (Table 1). To address these challenges, there is a pressing need for tailored training programs, improved dissemination and implementation of guidelines, and the development of region-specific antivenoms and protocols, in non-Big Four snakes including H. hypnale to strengthen snakebite care in diverse geographic settings. The integration of digital platforms and the establishment of comprehensive data registries will further support standardised care and improve patient outcomes. The insights gained from the panel discussion serves as a foundational framework for further enquiry and policy initiatives that can be better aligned to bridge existing gaps and advance snakebite management in India.

What you need to know

Bites from venomous snakes can result in bleeding, paralysis, long term disability, and death
Immobilise the bitten limb when transporting the patient to a medical facility; the universal use of pressure immobilisation is controversial, and tourniquets are not recommended
The 20-minute whole blood clotting test is a simple bedside test to screen for and monitor coagulopathy in resource-limited settings
Assess vital parameters and initiate resuscitation measures if the patient is clinically unstable with signs of bleeding, shock, paralysis, or respiratory distress
Intravenous antivenom is recommended in patients with systemic symptoms; the dose and type depend on likely snake species, local guidelines, and availability

Snakebite affects between 1.8 to 2.7 million people worldwide each year, and it is estimated to cause between 80 000 and 138 000 deaths. A mixture of toxins (venom) is injected into the body following bite by a venomous snake. Envenoming can be a highly dynamic clinical event. Symptoms can progressively worsen to a life-threatening emergency. Snakebites can have long term physical sequelae such as amputation, paralysis and disability, and psychological health consequences.

Snakebite envenoming is more common in South and South-East Asia (2 million annually), sub-Saharan Africa (420 000) and Latin America (150 000). These regions also report a high burden of deaths from snakebite (100 000, 32 000, and 5000 deaths respectively) possibly due to poor access to medical aid. Delayed diagnosis and treatment can worsen prognosis. The World Health Organization recognised snakebite as a neglected tropical disease in 2017 and called for concerted global action to reduce deaths and disability.

In this clinical update, we present an approach to evaluation and management of snakebites for primary care providers in resource-limited settings in endemic regions. The principles of management are broadly similar, but it is beyond the scope of this article to cover clinical syndromes and management for the varied snake species globally.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^116kdRX9]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Toxins and Environmental — Bites and Envenomation treatment and interventions — In prehospital care, consider an IV fluid bolus (normal saline or lactated Ringer's) 20 mL/kg up to 2 liters and consider vasopressors after adequate fluid resuscitation for the hypotensive patient; if seizure, treat per Seizures Guideline. For envenomations including black widow spider, bark scorpions, crotalid snakes (rattlesnake, copperhead) and coral snakes, consider transport to a hospital that has access to antivenom, if feasible. For jellyfish, generally scrape off remaining tentacles or nematocysts and immerse the affected body part in hot water (113°F/45°C); vinegar may be used to reduce pain due to deactivation of nematocysts except for certain species such as Physalia that may have nematocysts activated by vinegar, and vinegar may also activate sea nettle nematocysts and is not recommended after this exposure. For lionfish, scorpionfish, and stingray injuries, immerse the affected body part in hot water to reduce pain associated with the toxin, and provide adequate analgesia per the Pain Management Guideline.

Table 1
Text box summarising the consensus and debates warranting future research.

The Australian experience highlights a shift from using monovalent antivenoms guided by unreliable snake venom detection kits to focussing on diagnosing envenomation and administering polyvalent antivenom or two key monovalent antivenoms (brown and tiger snake) based on geography and clinical presentation. This approach has simplified antivenom use, reduced errors, and minimise risks associated with incorrect antivenom administration, highlighting the importance of diagnostic clarity and pragmatic treatment strategies. Syndromic management, supported by region-specific clinical guidelines, remains the most pragmatic approach until more effective diagnostic and treatment options become available in the region. The inconsistent adherence to snakebite management protocols across India highlights the need for standardised yet adaptable guidelines that cater to regional specificities, ensuring effective, contextually appropriate care that enhances patient outcomes and optimises resource use.

Plasmaphaeresis

Theoretically, therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) should facilitate the removal of venom toxins from the intravascular compartment, potentially redistributing them from extravascular spaces for subsequent elimination. While early case reports and studies indicate its utility in managing haematologic complications, robust evidence remains sparse. A retrospective study of 37 snakebite patients treated with TPE showed significant laboratory improvements and limb salvage without complications, supporting its use in complex cases. However, a systematic review by Noutsos and colleagues found no definitive evidence for TPE's benefit in TMA-associated acute kidney injury (AKI), despite a TMA prevalence of 5.4% in H. hypnale bites and 10–15% in Australian elapid envenomations. The American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) classifies TPE for snakebite envenomation as a Category III intervention, indicating that its optimal role in therapy remains unestablished and decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis. Plasmaphaeresis, while promising for complications like VICC and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), lacks robust evidence from randomised controlled trials. The panel identified this as a priority for future research to determine its optimal timing, efficacy before integration into treatment protocols, as outlined in Table 1, and emphasised the need for interim observational studies to guide current practice.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for basic wound management in the austere environment: 2014 update [^1117wTGV]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Wilderness wound infection prophylaxis and prevention — whether or not prophylactic antibiotics are given, wounds should be monitored closely because complications can develop rapidly or in an indolent manner. With the exception of certain specific wound categories, there is scant evidence to support the routine use of systemic antibiotics for prophylaxis against wound infection, with a notable exception of an open fracture in which acute antibiotic administration significantly lowers the rate of infection. Virtually all open wounds are colonized with microorganisms, but this is usually without clinical consequences, and the presence of colonizing bacteria does not constitute infection. A systematic review of mammalian bites showed a statistically significant reduction in infection with prophylactic antibiotics after bites by humans but not after bites by cats or dogs, except bites of the hand; there was also a statistically significant reduction in infection after mammalian bites to the hand. Although dated, there is evidence to support the use of topical antibiotics to promote wound healing and decrease infection.

### Recurrence phenomena after immunoglobulin therapy for snake envenomations: part 2. guidelines for clinical management with crotaline fab antivenom [^113fXvGk]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Recurrent local and coagulopathic effects (worsening after clinical improvement) have been described after treatment with Fab antivenom for envenomation by North American crotaline snakes. Although similar phenomena have been described previously in snakebite, few studies have examined recurrence or its management. Recurrence is consistent with known venom and antivenom kinetics and dynamics. The clinical significance of late coagulopathy after snakebite is uncertain, but clinically significant bleeding is a possibility. Prevention and treatment of recurrence with Fab antivenom require repeated dosing for at least 18 hours, with close monitoring of at-risk patients in the follow-up period. Duration of therapy depends on individual risk factors and coagulation response.

Risk of adverse reactions with antivenom

Monitor patients for adverse reactions in the first two hours of antivenom administration (box 2). Anaphylaxis or pyrogenic reactions occur early (within minutes or hours). Mechanistic studies suggest that most events are not IgE mediated and thus cannot be accurately predicted by skin tests for immediate hypersensitivity. However, their incidence and severity can be reduced by a prophylactic subcutaneous injection of low dose adrenaline. Pyrogenic reactions result from product contamination during manufacture.

Box 2
Clinical features and frequency of adverse reactions to antivenom

Depending on the dose, speed of administration, and product quality, the risk of any early reaction varies from 3% to more than 80% in studies from Latin America and South Asia. About 5–10% of such events are associated with life threatening consequences. The incidence of fatal reactions is unclear because of confusion with symptoms of envenoming, but some have been reported.

Treat anaphylaxis at the earliest sign. Suspend antivenom administration and inject adrenaline intramuscularly, ideally into the upper lateral thigh. Additional treatment includes intravenous antihistamines and glucocorticoids and inhaled bronchodilators for bronchospasm. Anaphylaxis can recur, and glucocorticoids do not prevent recurrence. On resolution of the episode, cautiously resume antivenom in patients with a definite indication for continued treatment. Treat pyrogenic reactions with physical cooling, antipyretics, and intravenous fluids.

Late reactions may manifest a week after administration. Their incidence varies widely from 5% to 56% in observational studies and trials using differing diagnostic criteria.WHO guidelines recommend a five-day course of oral antihistamines for those with serum-sickness type late reactions, and a five-day course of prednisolone in those who fail antihistamine therapy after the first two days.

Whom to refer?

Patients with persistent bleeding despite repeated antivenom treatment or having respiratory and renal failure may require urgent supportive measures such as blood transfusion, mechanical ventilation, and renal replacement therapy respectively. If these are not available, arrange for transfer to a specialised centre. Patients with substantial bleeding, worsening paralysis, dropping urine output, refractory shock, anaphylaxis non-responsive to adrenaline, or compartment syndrome may also require specialist management and intensive care.

Having contact details of emergency transport and the referral centre readily available can avoid delays. Inform the receiving hospital about the patient's condition over the phone and send a referral letter with details of assessment and treatment.

### A global core outcome measurement set for snakebite clinical trials [^115WKXCK]. The Lancet: Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Shortlisting core outcome domains

Through our systematic review, 153 unique outcome measures were extracted verbatim, and 60 outcome domains were identified. A shortlisting questionnaire (appendix p 5) was circulated to the stakeholder and expert groups. Domains were scored and categorised as: 7–9 (essential); 6–4 (desirable); or 3–1 (inappropriate). At least two domains were shortlisted for each clinical syndrome of envenoming, based on score rankings. Respondents could recommend additional domains not identified through the systematic review, and these were automatically shortlisted (appendix p 13).

Four universal and seven syndrome-specific categories were agreed by the stakeholder and expert groups: Universal (all snake species) categories include: (1) mortality, (2) disability, (3) acute allergic reaction, and (4) serum sickness; and syndrome-specific (snake species-specific) categories include: (1) neurotoxicity, (2) haemotoxicity, (3) coagulopathy, (4) local tissue damage, (5) renal injury, (6) systemic myotoxicity, and (7) hypotension.

Reaching consensus on core outcome measures

A primary literature review was prepared by one investigator (MA), circulated to the stakeholder and expert groups for wider input, and maintained as a live document (appendix p 14). This literature review included relevant information on outcome domains and outcome measurement instruments. A series of four stakeholder group consensus meetings were held, with a total duration of 10 h. One investigator (MA) presented a summary of the questionnaire results and literature for each shortlisted outcome domain. Meetings were chaired by a senior investigator (DGL). A semistructured discussion on outcome domains and outcome measurement instruments took place, and all stakeholder group members had the opportunity to share their views. Once all views had been shared, anonymous voting took place with at least 70% agreement needed to confirm a core outcome measure.

Encounters with venomous snakes can lead to substantial morbidity or mortality if managed inappropriately. Medical management is the mainstay of treatment, but surgery may be necessary in rare cases. The hand surgeon should be well versed in the types of venomous snakes, the mechanism of action of venom, and the management of these injuries, given the frequency of hand envenomation. The indications for surgery are not well established and rely on clinical judgment and practitioner's experience. An understanding of previously reported outcomes and an algorithmic approach to treatment will help improve patient care and avoid complications.

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^114ygow5]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

The target population for these recommendations includes CCB-poisoned adults. However, given the paucity of literature for the treatment of CCB-poisoned children and the absence of evidence that children respond differently than adults to CCB poisoning, the workgroup believes that it is reasonable to apply the recommendations to the pediatric population.

Even if articles were found to answer some KQs (1–5), the overall evidence available to develop these recommendations was of very low quality. Many interventions had only been studied for surrogate outcomes. With the exception of VA-ECMO for cardiotoxicant poisonings, the use of and costs associated with these resources had not been described (KQ5) (Fig. 1). Hence, many questions within our proposed analytic framework remain unanswered (Fig. 1). These represent potential areas for future research.

First, comparative studies should be conducted to identify which intervention improves intermediate and health outcome (KQ 1, 3, and 4) for each specific class of CCB (KQ 2) with acceptable adverse effects and cost (KQ 5). Second, observational studies should identify prognostic factors, which is particularly imperative in severe cases that may potentially require VA-ECMO (KQ 2). Third, scientists should conduct clinical trials to identify factors associated with favorable responses to high-dose insulin therapies (KQ 2). Prospective, controlled clinical trials are needed to evaluate currently recommended antidotes or to assess new ones (KQ 1, 3, 4, and 5) (Table 3).

### Quality of WHO guidelines on snakebite: the neglect continues [^114gr2qH]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

The quality scores for overall and several key domains of both the WHO guidelines were low (table 1). Scores in the stakeholder development domain were poor (52% for the WHO-SEARO 2016 guideline and 31% for the WHO-AFRO 2010 guideline) due to non-involvement of all categories of health workers, snakebite survivors and their carers in guideline panels. The domain of rigour of development got the lowest scores (15% for the WHO-SEARO 2016 guideline and 16% for the WHO-AFRO 2010 guideline) as the guidelines were not based on systematic search, appraisal and grading of evidence. While the WHO-SEARO 2016 guideline has mentioned levels of evidence, these are based on study designs (with no consideration of quality of evidence), with most recommendations are expert opinions. Information on the methodology for formulation of recommendations was also not reported in either of the guidelines. Lack of explicitly reported conflict of interests meant scores in the domain for editorial independence were also poor, and industry representatives were involved in the guideline development process. For the domains of scope and purpose, clarity of presentation and applicability the WHO-SEARO 2016 guideline had better scores than the WHO-AFRO 2010 guideline; however, the scores in both the guidelines were in the moderate range. Overall, both guidelines were rated poorly.

Table 1
Quality of WHO guidelines on snakebite using AGREE II

About a decade ago, the WHO initiated a mechanism to oversee quality assurance through the formation of the Guideline Review Committee in response to public outcry over guidelines being based on expert opinion. These changes have led to improvements in guideline quality. However, it appears that these mechanisms are not being implemented or are being bypassed for snakebite guidelines as recently as 2016. We therefore call on the WHO to strictly implement its own policies for guideline development on snakebite envenoming. Guidelines provide the crucial pivot for action to decrease mortality and morbidity and we call upon the WHO to ensure development of evidence-based snakebite guidelines, involving representative of categories of healthcare workers and snakebite survivors in a transparent manner as is being done for other diseases.

What first aid can be provided?

Reassure the person about prompt first aid and medical assistance to allay fears. Arrange for rapid transport to the nearest medical facility, preferably with access to antivenom and critical care support.

Immobilise the person, and especially the bitten limb to slow venom spread. Remove rings and other tight objects around the limb. A systematic review identified pressure immobilisation with an elastic bandage or pad (at a comfortable pressure) at the bite site as an effective first aid measure to slow venom spread, but the quality of evidence was very low. Its use is variable, and it is discouraged in most practice and guidelines because of the uncertainty of benefit and possibility of worsening local tissue damage. However, pressure immobilisation is generally recommended for neurotoxic elapid bites in some regions. Its clinical efficacy and risk of worsening soft tissue injury in local envenoming have not been adequately assessed. A small study (15 patients) in Myanmar found that pressure pads were effective in reducing venom spread in Russell's viper bite, and local effects after pad application were no more severe than those before treatment.

Tourniquets can cause severe local damage and gangrene and must not be used. It is common for communities to resort to traditional therapies such as wound incisions, cauterisation, and application of herbs, minerals, or animal excrement. These can delay access to effective treatment and may cause more harm. Irrigate eyes with copious amounts of water if there is exposure to venom.

### A locally developed snakebite management protocol significantly reduces overall anti snake venom utilization in west bengal, India [^115raaf1]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of a nationally developed snakebite treatment protocol on the amount of anti snake venom (ASV) used in treating snakebites in a developing country and its effect on mortality. In addition, basic epidemiology data were collected and analyzed.

Methods

Experts in Indian snakebites developed a protocol specifically designed for snakebite treatment in India. A training program was implemented in Midnapore Medical College in West Bengal, India, under the direction of the Health Minister to train care providers in the new protocol. After training, data were collected for 839 snakebite victims over a 12-month period and included epidemiological data, ASV volumes administered, and mortality. The results were collated and compared with results calculated from 780 snakebite victims treated during the 12-month period before implementation of the protocol. Treatment prior to protocol implementation was based on knowledge gained by the care providers from western and forensic medicine textbooks.

Results

Protocol-guided treatment resulted in a 66% decline in the amount of ASV administered to victims. Fewer victims received ASV based on rational guidelines for assessing envenomation, dosage and repeat dosage, and clear endpoints to ASV therapy. In addition, there was a trend towards reduced mortality and an absolute reduction of 24%.

Conclusion

Use of the protocol reduced ASV utilization and the number of deaths. Locally developed protocols should be encouraged by such organizations as the World Health Organization and national and state governments and should be established with significant input from local experts.

### Does this patient have a severe snake envenomation? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^114FGrWo]. JAMA Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Venomous snakebite severity ranges from an asymptomatic dry bite to severe envenomation and death. The clinical evaluation aids in prognosis and is essential to determine the risks and potential benefits of antivenom treatment.

Objectives

To identify historical features, clinical examination findings, basic laboratory testing, and clinical grading scales that will risk-stratify patients with pit viper snake envenomation for severe systemic envenomation, severe tissue injury, and/or severe hematologic venom effects.

Data Sources

We conducted a structured search of PubMed (1966-October 3, 2017) and Embase database (1980-October 3, 2017) to identify English-language studies that evaluated clinical features predictive of severe envenomation.

Study Selection

We included studies that evaluated the test performance of at least 1 clinical finding with an acceptable reference standard of severe envenomation for venomous snakes of the Western Hemisphere. Only studies involving the most common subfamily, Crotalinae (pit vipers), were evaluated. Seventeen studies with data were available for abstraction.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

The clinical features assessed and severity outcome measures were extracted from each original study. We assessed severity in 3 categories: systemic toxicity, tissue injury, and hematologic effects. Differences were resolved by author consensus.

Results

The pooled prevalence of severe systemic envenomation was 14% (95% CI, 9%-21%). The pooled prevalence of severe tissue injury and severe hematologic venom effects were 14% (95% CI, 12%-16%) and 18% (95% CI, 8%-27%), respectively. Factors increasing the likelihood of severe systemic envenomation included the time from bite to care of 6 or more hours (likelihood ratio [LR], 3.4 [95% CI, 1.1–6.4]), a patient younger than 12 years (LRs, 3.2 [95% CI, 1.5–7.1] and 2.9 [95% CI, 1.3–6.2]), large snake size (LR, 3.1 [95% CI, 1.5–5.7]), and ptosis (LRs, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.0–2.1] and 3.8 [95% CI, 1.8–8.3]). Envenomation by the genus Agkistrodon (copperhead and cottonmouth), as opposed to rattlesnakes, decreased the likelihood of severe systemic envenomation (LR, 0.28 [95% CI, 0.10–0.78]). Initial hypofibrinogenemia (LR, 5.1 [95% CI, 1.7–15.0]) and thrombocytopenia (LR, 3.7 [95% CI, 1.9–7.3]) increased the likelihood of severe hematologic venom effects. Other clinical features from history, physical examination, or normal laboratory values were not discriminative.

Conclusions

Clinical features can identify patients at increased risk of severe systemic envenomation and severe hematologic venom effects, but there are few features that are associated with severe tissue injury or can confidently exclude severe envenomation. Physicians should monitor patients closely and be wary of progression from nonsevere to a severe envenomation and have a low threshold to escalate therapy as needed.

### Clinical challenges, controversies, and regional strategies in snakebite care in India [^116m58T5]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2025). High credibility.

Methods

Context and setting

The study was conducted as part of a national workshop on snakebite management, held at [a tertiary care institute] May 17–19, 2024. The workshop featured a 90-min panel discussion moderated by the principal investigator (SVA), with predefined questions addressing audience-submitted queries through Whatsapp groups. The discussion took place in a structured environment, with experts from various medical and scientific disciplines sharing their insights on snakebite management practices and challenges. This structured format was intentionally ensured so that the discussion remained focused on practical challenges, acknowledging that the structured nature might hinder spontaneous emergence of themes or inter-participant dynamics.

Design

This study employed a qualitative research design within an interpretivist paradigm, utilising thematic analysis to explore the perspectives and experiences of experts in snakebite management. The thematic analysis allowed for the identification and interpretation of patterns and themes within the data, providing in-depth insights into the complexities of snakebite treatment and management. Thematic analysis was chosen for its flexibility and ability to systematically identify and interpret patterns within diverse qualitative data. While panel discussions differ from focus group discussions or in-depth interviews, the use of a verbatim transcript enabled analysis, aligning with established methodologies. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from an appropriate ethics review board (IEC: 108/24/IEC/JMMC&RI). All participants provided informed consent for their contributions to be recorded and used for research purposes.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^1174RKEu]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Snakebite first aid — Removal of constricting jewelry is a reasonable first aid action for envenomated limbs. Ice application is not generally recommended for the treatment of snakebite. Suction, with or without incision, is not effective in venom removal and may cause tissue injury. Electric shock therapy is ineffective and potentially harmful. Tourniquet application was found to be ineffective or to worsen local tissue injury. Evidence for pressure immobilization bandaging is mixed, and appropriate placement rates are low even under ideal conditions. Although a properly placed pressure immobilization bandage may have a role in neurotoxic snakebite, > 95% of snake envenomation in North America is pit viper envenomation with cytotoxic venom, and pressure immobilization bandaging is not currently recommended for use in North America.

Antivenom efficacy and development of region-specific protocols for effective snakebite management

The effectiveness of antivenoms, particularly polyvalent formulations like the Indian polyvalent antivenom (IPAV), has been a focal point of debate in snakebite management due to its variable efficacy across different snake species and geographic regions. Standardised treatment protocols for snakebites often fail to account for the regional differences in snake species, venom composition, and healthcare infrastructure. There is a need for region-specific antivenoms, and updated treatment guidelines tailored to the local snake fauna.

Rajasthan, with its desert-adapted snakes, and the North East, where haemotoxic Big Four species are rare, require different management approaches compared to other parts of India. Physicians' experience and clinical observations both suggest that, the Indian polyvalent antivenom (IPAV) is ineffective against H. hypnale venom. However, in a recent survey, 43% of respondents indicated they would administer the currently available polyvalent antivenom for snakebites positively identified as H. hypnale. They based their decision on "relying on a syndromic approach rather than species identification", "lacking confidence in accurately identifying the snake", and "concern about medicolegal implications of withholding antivenom from patients showing signs of envenomation". The panel emphasised that administering Indian polyvalent antivenom (IPAV) for H. hypnale envenomation could cause more harm than benefit, particularly when the risks of adverse reactions outweigh any potential, albeit unsupported, benefits of IPAV in non-Big Four species (Table 1). Standardised treatment protocols for snakebites often fail to account for the regional differences in snake species, venom composition, and healthcare infrastructure. There is a need for region-specific antivenoms, and updated treatment guidelines tailored to the local snake fauna.

### Snakebite first aid… [^112meiVg]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Snakebite First Aid In recent years, first aid measures for snakebites have been radically revised to exclude methods that were found to worsen a patient's condition, such as tight tourniquets, aggressive wound incisions, and ice. Initial treatment measures should include avoiding excessive activity, immobilizing the bitten extremity, and quickly transporting the victim to the nearest hospital. Treatment Patients with snakebite must be admitted to an emergency department, where a poison control center should be contacted immediately. Wounds should be cleaned, and administration of tetanus toxoid or tetanus immune globulin should be considered for under-immunized or nonimmunized patients. Patients should be given intravenous fluid, and blood should be drawn from an unaffected extremity. Complete recommendations for laboratory evaluations of snakebite are summarized in.

8 Prophylactic antibiotics are usually not recommended, as the occurrence of wound infection following crotalid envenomation is low. 18, 19 Patients with bites from snakes with neurotoxic venom should be observed for at least 24 hours. A patient with suspected envenomation by the eastern coral snake needs immediate treatment with an appropriate antivenin, and necessary resuscitation measures should be implemented. For rattlesnake, cottonmouth, and copperhead bites, Antivenin Polyvalent has been the standard available treatment; however, ACP is known to be highly allergenic because of its equine origin and may pose a greater risk to the patient than the snakebite. Ideally, antivenin is administered within four hours of the snakebite, but it is effective for at least the first 24 hours. Physicians should be present for antivenin administration, and epinephrine and antihistamines should be at the bedside.

28 Suggested intravenous antihistamine pretreatment is diphenhydramine, in a dosage of 1 mg per kg, and cimetidine, in a dosage of 6 mg per kg. 8 If signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis develop, the patient should be immediately treated with epinephrine and steroids. 8 Unstable patients must receive antivenin because no other treatment can reverse the venom's effect.

### Core outcome set for intervention research on snakebite envenomation in south Asia [^1116ziqq]. Injury Prevention (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The 2019 WHO strategy to reduce snakebite burden emphasises the need for fostering research on snakebite treatments. A core outcome set (COS) is a consensus minimal list of outcomes that should be measured in research on a particular condition. We aimed to develop a COS for snakebite research in South Asia, the region with the highest burden.

Methods

We used data from a systematic review of outcomes to develop a long list of outcomes which were rated in two rounds of online Delphi survey with healthcare providers, patients and the public, and potential COS users to develop a COS for intervention research on snakebite treatments in South Asia for five intervention groups. Subsequently, meetings, consultations and workshops were organised to reach further consensus. We defined the consensus criteria a priori.

Results

Overall, 72 and 61 people, including patients and the public, participated in round I and round II of the Delphi, respectively. Consensus COSs (including definition and time points) were developed for interventions that prevent adverse reaction to snake antivenom (three outcomes), specifically manage neurotoxic manifestations (five outcomes), specifically manage haematological manifestations (five outcomes) and those that act against snake venom (seven) outcomes. A priori criteria for inclusion in COS were not met for COS on interventions for management of the bitten part.

Conclusion

The COS contributes to improving research efficiency by standardising outcome measurement in South Asia. It also provides methodological insights for future development of COS, beyond snakebite.

### Venomous snakebites in the United States: management review and update [^111i242e]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Venomous snakebites, although uncommon, are a potentially deadly emergency in the United States. Rattlesnakes cause most snakebites and related fatalities. Venomous snakes in the United States can be classified as having hemotoxic or neurotoxic venom. Patients with venomous snakebites present with signs and symptoms ranging from fang marks, with or without local pain and swelling, to life-threatening coagulopathy, renal failure, and shock. First-aid techniques such as arterial tourniquets, application of ice, and wound incisions are ineffective and can be harmful; however, suction with a venom extractor within the first five minutes after the bite may be useful. Conservative measures, such as immobilization and lymphatic constriction bands, are now advocated until emergency care can be administered. Patients with snakebites should undergo a comprehensive work-up to look for possible hematologic, neurologic, renal, and cardiovascular abnormalities. Equine-derived antivenin is considered the standard of care; however, a promising new treatment is sheep-derived antigen binding fragment ovine (CroFab), which is much less allergenic. Although there is no universal grading system for snakebites, a I through IV grading scale is clinically useful as a guide to antivenin administration. Surgical intervention with fasciotomy is now reserved for rare cases. Snakebite prevention should be taught to patients.

### How should native crotalid envenomation Be managed in the emergency department? [^116bCajW]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Pit vipers, also known as crotalids, are a group of snakes including rattlesnakes, copperheads, and cottonmouths (water moccasins). Crotalids have a broad geographic distribution across the United States, and bites from these snakes can carry significant morbidity. Their envenomations are characterized by local tissue effects, hematologic effects, and systemic effects. Envenomations are generally treated with 1 of 2 antivenoms available in the United States.

Objective

We developed a series of clinical questions to assist and guide the emergency physician in the acute management of a patient envenomated by a crotalid.

Methods

We conducted a PubMed literature review from January 1970 to May 2020 in English for articles with the keywords "bite" and "crotalidae".

Results

Our literature search resulted in 177 articles. A total of 33 articles met criteria for rigorous review and citation in the development of these consensus guidelines.

Conclusions

Patients should be initially evaluated, stabilized, and assessed for local effects, hematologic effects, and systemic toxicity suggestive of envenomation. Antivenom should be given if toxic effects are present. Surgical intervention including debridement and fasciotomy should be avoided. Prophylactic antibiotics are not necessary.

### Managing snakebite [^111vseKs]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Antivenom

Guidelines from the WHO recommend antivenom treatment for patients with shock, spontaneous systemic bleeding, uncoagulable blood, neurotoxicity, black urine, acute kidney injury, rapidly progressive local swelling, and bites by species known to cause local necrosis and digital bites.

Antivenoms are whole or fragmented immunoglobulins fractionated from the plasma of domesticated animals hyper-immunised with venom from one or more snake species over variable periods. They are highly specific and will neutralise only the venoms used in their production and those of a few closely related species. Polyspecific antivenoms are raised against a mixture of venoms from more than one species. Antivenoms raised against venom from a single species are monospecific.

Early administration of antivenom prevents or limits haemodynamic alterations, progression of coagulopathy to clinically overt bleeding, postsynaptic neurotoxicity, myotoxicity, acute kidney injury, and local tissue damage. Physiological levels of clotting factors are at least partially restored within a median of six hours with sufficient doses of specific antivenoms.

Robust clinical data on the safe and effective initial dose of antivenom are lacking for most products. Clinicians often rely on manufacturers' recommendations provided as package inserts or labels, but these can be unreliable. We suggest following national protocols or standard regional guidelines for dose. Administration is always intravenous, as bolus or diluted in saline solution over 10–60 minutes, at the same dose for adults and children. Repeat administration of antivenom if bleeding persists, if weakness or cardiovascular signs worsen within two hours, or if a 20WBCT is positive at six hours after antivenom administration.

The effectiveness of antivenoms in treating established neurotoxicity, soft tissue damage, and acute kidney injury is not established. Additional treatments are indicated for these.

### A global core outcome measurement set for snakebite clinical trials [^114jvGwU]. The Lancet: Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

As articulated by Kofi Annan, "Snakebite is the biggest public health crisis you have likely never heard of". Snakebites cause an estimated 1.8 million envenomings and 94 000 deaths each year, with the highest burden in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. On June 9, 2017, the WHO classified snakebite as a priority neglected tropical disease, and since then increased funding has been allocated by major donors. The need to standardise outcome measure reporting is crucial, particularly given the pipeline of snakebite therapeutics with multispecies specificity, which will require clinical trial assessment across multiple regions. Standardisation of reporting of allergic reactions to antivenom products is essential.

A core outcome measurement set provides a list of outcome measures to be reported in all clinical trials in a disease area. The core outcome measurement set does not preclude trialists from selecting primary, secondary, or safety outcome measures that are not in the core set. Snakebite presents a unique challenge as different snake species cause diverse clinical syndromes.

In preparation for developing the core outcome measurement set, a systematic review was done. Over 40 randomised controlled trials have been undertaken, although heterogeneity has largely prevented meta-analyses. Many trials have used poorly defined, non-reproducible outcome measures, and only trials in high-income settings have included patient-centred outcome measures.

To address this priority, a globally diverse multidisciplinary stakeholder group adopted a structured evidence-based method to reach consensus on a global set of core outcome measurements for snakebite clinical trials.

Thematic analysis of the panel discussion on snakebite management

The thematic analysis identified four key themes. The first theme focused on the evolution of snakebite treatment, transitioning from unspecialised to specialised care, setting the foundation for subsequent discussions. This shift highlighted the importance of specialised care in addressing snakebite management, leading to the second theme: the clinical and procedural challenges that emerge in treating snakebite cases. From these challenges, the third theme surfaced, covering the debates, controversies, and doubts among the expert panellists. Finally, the fourth theme addressed the role of policy and research in shaping future approaches to snakebite management.

Theme 1: evolution of snakebite treatment paradigms (ES)

This theme captures the progressive changes in snakebite management, focussing on antivenom use, the establishment of specialised care units, and shifts in diagnostic practices.
- **ES-AV (Historical changes in antivenom use)**: The approach to antivenom has evolved from limited and low-dose use in the 1970s to a standardised 10-vial treatment across snake species. " The serious nature of pit viper bites was fully acknowledged in 2006, marking a major shift in management " (KBM). Recognising the ineffectiveness of antivenom for pit viper bites helped reduce wastage and unnecessary administration.
- **ES-SC (Advancements in specialised care)**: Specialised snakebite care units were established in response to high mortality rates from complications such as capillary leak syndrome and renal failure. The introduction of haemodialysis and ventilatory support in the 1970s was a turning point, significantly reducing mortality (" The introduction of dialysis and ventilatory support greatly reduced mortality rates… "–KBM).
- **ES-DX (Historical changes in diagnosis)**: Early diagnostic challenges, such as misidentifying species, compounded treatment issues (UB, KBM). The limited number of experts and lack of literature made it difficult to distinguish between species and species specific syndromes during that period (" Initially thought to be a subspecies of the saw-scaled viper… later identified as a Hump-Nosed Pit Viper "–KBM).

Theme 2: clinical and procedural challenges in snakebite management (CP)

This theme addresses the various clinical and procedural difficulties encountered in managing snakebites, including challenges specific to high-volume centres.

### Envenomations: an overview of clinical toxinology for the primary care physician [^113oxgXj]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

About 4,000 to 6,000 venomous snakebites occur each year in the United States. Although these envenomations (also known as envenomings) are rarely fatal, about 70 percent require antivenom therapy. Few evidence-based guidelines are available for the management of envenomation. Antivenom therapy is the cornerstone of management for hemorrhagic or coagulopathic envenomation from pit vipers (with or without paralytic features), and for paralytic envenomation from coral snakes. Early intubation and ventilation may be required after bites from pit vipers whose venoms contain presynaptic neurotoxins. Although relatively controversial, antivenom therapy seems to be effective for the management of severe envenomation from widow spiders. Conversely, little evidence supports any specific management strategy for necrotic envenomation from recluse spiders. Cytotoxic fish stings, cnidarian stings, and traumatic penetrative envenomation by stingrays are typically managed symptomatically. Private collection of nonnative venomous animals in the United States is another source of medical risk.

Other treatments

Neostigmine with atropine is a potentially useful adjunct in patients bitten by snakes such as some cobras with postsynaptic neurotoxins in their venom. Its use must never delay or preclude antivenom treatment or intubation.

Administer a tetanus toxoid booster in all patients except in those with coagulopathy, in which case injection is postponed until haemostasis is achieved. Aspirate large tense bullae to facilitate nursing the bitten limb, pre-empt spontaneous rupture, and prevent secondary infection. Broad spectrum antibiotics are indicated only if the wound has been incised or there are signs of necrosis, wound infection, or abscess formation. Surgical debridement or amputation of gangrenous digits or limbs and skin grafting may be needed. Fasciotomies are rarely justified since compartment pressures usually remain within normal limits.

Treatment — general considerations and decontamination: As with any potentially serious illness or injury in the field, care begins with an assessment of scene safety followed by a primary evaluation of the patient with interventions as needed to support airway, breathing, and circulation, and epinephrine should be given as soon as possible once anaphylaxis has been identified. Removal of the inciting allergen is appropriate in certain circumstances, such as immediately removing an insect stinger from the skin to prevent additional injection of venom (avoiding pressure, if possible, on the venom sac). Exposure to aerosolized, food-based allergens should be stopped by discontinuing on-site cooking of the associated food and, if feasible, distancing of the patient, and inducing vomiting for food-based allergens has not been proven effective and may delay treatment with epinephrine.

Who is at risk of snakebite?

Rural communities in tropical countries are worst affected. Agricultural workers, hunter-gatherers, herders, fishermen, and rural families living in precarious housing conditions with outdoor toilets have a higher risk of snakebite. Their living environments intersect with snake habitats. Men between 10 and 40 years are more commonly affected. Non-mechanised farming techniques, barefoot farming, and sleeping on the floor further increase the risk. Bites are more common during wetter months, when agricultural activities and breeding season for snakes potentially converge.

Pertinent assessment findings include assessing for signs and symptoms of local and systematic impact of the suspected toxin and recognizing that a patient may still have an imbedded stinger, tooth, nematocysts, or barb which may continue to deliver toxin if left imbedded. Associated NEMSIS Protocol(s) include 9914079 — Injury - Bites and Envenomations-Land and 9914081 — Injury - Bites and Envenomations-Marine. Key documentation elements include accurately describing the suspect bite or sting source without risking patient or emergency medical services (EMS) clinician, only transporting the source animal or insect if it can be done safely in a hard-sided container, repeating evaluation and documentation of signs and symptoms as patient clinical conditions may deteriorate rapidly, recording time of symptoms onset and time of initiation of exposure-specific treatments, and documenting therapy and response to therapy. Performance measures include that the offending organism was managed appropriately without secondary exposure, appropriate and timely definitive treatment was provided, and appropriate pain management was achieved.

### Clinical challenges, controversies, and regional strategies in snakebite care in India [^114PH5Nz]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Snakebite envenomation remains a significant public health challenge in India, particularly in rural areas where access to timely and appropriate medical care is limited. The complexities of snakebite management are compounded by the diverse species of venomous snakes present in the region, each with varying effects on the human body. Despite advancements in antivenom production and snakebite care protocols, there remains considerable debate and variability in treatment approaches, particularly for species like Hump-nosed pit viper (Hypnale hypnale) that are not covered by the Indian polyvalent antivenom (IPAV).

The Snake Bite Life Support (SBLS) workshop, held as part of ongoing efforts to enhance snakebite management within a One Health framework, to improve snakebite management, brought together a panel of experts with over 300 years of collective experience in treating snakebite cases. This panel discussion, titled "Core Principles and Controversies in Snake Bite Management", aimed to explore the evolving treatment paradigms, the challenges faced by clinicians, and the need for region-specific antivenom strategies. The discussion also focused on the current consensus guidelines and the controversies that still exist in the field, providing valuable insights into the complexities of managing snakebite envenomation in the region.

Toxins and Environmental — Bites and Envenomation patient safety — Do not apply tourniquets, tight Ace/crepe bandage, or constricting bands above or below the site; do not incise and/or suction the wound to remove toxin; and do not apply cold packs or immerse the extremity in ice water. EMS clinicians should not try to capture the marine or terrestrial animal or insect. If the organism has been killed, many dead insect, marine, or fanged animals can continue to bite or sting with venom and should be safely placed in a hard sided and closed container for future identification. A patient may still have an imbedded stinger, tooth, nematocyst, or barb that may continue to deliver toxin if left imbedded; consider safe removal without squeezing the toxin delivery apparatus.

Global list of snake species

We assembled a list of snake species, using WHO guidelines for venomous snake species of medical importance (hereafter referred to as snakes), which define two tiers of medical importance that reflect both ecological knowledge on propensity to interact with humans and clinical grading of toxicity. Category one species are common or widespread snakes that result in high morbidity, disability, or mortality. Category two species are snakes capable of causing morbidity, disability, or death, or for which epidemiological or clinical data are missing or are less frequently implicated.

Where relevant, expert opinion range (EOR) maps were obtained from WHO blood products online database or the Clinical Toxinology Resources database. Occurrence data for each species were obtained from the, and, using the spocc R package (version 0.7.0) on May 29, 2017. Duplicate records based upon shared collection year and latitude or longitude and those missing latitude or longitude were removed.

Given the availability of data, we placed snakes into three groups: group A (no available EOR map or species occurrence records), group B (EOR map but < 5 species occurrence records), and group C (EOR map and ≥ 5 species occurrence records). Group A species (n = 9) were excluded from this analysis because of the absence of geographical information, reducing our species inclusion list to 278 (99 group B species and 179 group C species; appendix 1).

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^111mZEHf]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Snake bite — background for North America includes burden, species, and effects. Approximately 8000 to 10000 people are treated for snakebite in the United States each year, and two families of venomous snakes (Crotalinae and Elapidae) are indigenous to the United States. More than 95% of venomous bites in North America are caused by crotaline snakes (Crotalinae, also known as pit vipers), specifically rattlesnakes, copperheads, and cottonmouths. Venom from crotaline snakes causes tissue injury and may also cause low blood pressure, bleeding, and muscle fasciculations leading to paralysis. In the United States, bites from coral snakes (Elapidae) occur in the Southeast (primarily Florida) and the Southwest (Texas, New Mexico, Arizona). These bites do not cause tissue injury; coral snake venom is primarily neurotoxic and can cause paralysis within minutes to hours.

### Clinical aspects of snakebite envenoming and its treatment in low-resource settings [^112zVrSf]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

There is increasing recognition of the public health importance of snakebite envenoming. Worldwide annual incidence is likely to be 5 million bites, with mortality exceeding 150000 deaths, and the resulting physical and psychological morbidity leads to substantial social and economic repercussions. Prevention through community education by trained health workers is the most effective and economically viable strategy for reducing risk of bites and envenoming. Clinical challenges to effective treatment are most substantial in rural areas of low-resource settings, where snakebites are most common. Classic skills of history taking, physical examination, and use of affordable point-of-care tests should be followed by monitoring of evolving local and systemic envenoming. Despite the profusion of new ideas for interventions, hyperimmune equine or ovine plasma-derived antivenoms remain the only specific treatment for snakebite envenoming. The enormous interspecies and intraspecies complexity and diversity of snake venoms, revealed by modern venomics, demands a radical redesign of many current antivenoms.

How is snakebite managed?

Resuscitation and supportive care

Admit all snakebite patients for observation for a minimum of 24 hours. The onset of symptoms may be delayed but can worsen rapidly. Inform patients and/or their relatives about potential complications, treatment, and critical-care measures using simple language, after emergency medical stabilisation. If required, explain the need for referral clearly.

Promptly manage airway obstruction, respiratory paralysis, and shock by restoring airway, oxygen, intubation, and assisted ventilation as needed, and intravenous fluids. Figure 3 summarises the management of snakebite. Choose sites of venous access such as the hands, wrists, and in some cases the feet where haemostasis by external pressure is most likely to succeed. Avoid central venous or arterial punctures before establishing a negative 20WBCT. Ensure that an intravenous line and resuscitation facilities are in place before releasing tourniquets, since this may trigger pronounced clinical deterioration. Avoid aspirin or other NSAIDs to control pain as they can exacerbate bleeding diathesis.

Flowchart for the management of snakebite

Monitor vital parameters and urine output at regular intervals in all patients. The 20WBCT can be repeated as it is sometimes negative initially, and coagulopathy may be detected later.

### Snakebite envenoming [^111YvdEQ]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2017). Medium credibility.

Snakebite envenoming is a neglected tropical disease that kills > 100,000 people and maims > 400,000 people every year. Impoverished populations living in the rural tropics are particularly vulnerable; snakebite envenoming perpetuates the cycle of poverty. Snake venoms are complex mixtures of proteins that exert a wide range of toxic actions. The high variability in snake venom composition is responsible for the various clinical manifestations in envenomings, ranging from local tissue damage to potentially life-threatening systemic effects. Intravenous administration of antivenom is the only specific treatment to counteract envenoming. Analgesics, ventilator support, fluid therapy, haemodialysis and antibiotic therapy are also used. Novel therapeutic alternatives based on recombinant antibody technologies and new toxin inhibitors are being explored. Confronting snakebite envenoming at a global level demands the implementation of an integrated intervention strategy involving the WHO, the research community, antivenom manufacturers, regulatory agencies, national and regional health authorities, professional health organizations, international funding agencies, advocacy groups and civil society institutions.

### Managing snakebite [^11785DX9]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

What to cover on initial assessment?

Rural and remote primary care centres are often the first point of medical aid for people with a snakebite. Laboratory and intensive care services at such facilities are often limited. A competent clinical assessment is vital to guide management and referral decisions.

Snakebite envenoming can quickly worsen into a life-threatening emergency. Assess vital parameters to identify if the patient is critical or at risk for shock, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest. Published severity scores for snakebite are unreliable. The Glasgow coma scale score and pupillary reactions can be misleading in patients with advanced paralysis who are unable to open their eyes or respond to painful stimuli and should be avoided in these circumstances.

History

Reassure clinically stable patients. Ask about their symptoms to determine the presence, nature, and extent of envenoming. Details about the site, circumstances, and timing of the bite can reflect distinctive features of epidemiology, habitats, and periods of activity of medically important snakes locally and help infer likely biting-species.

Inquire about medications, substance use, and comorbidities as these can influence diagnosis and outcomes. Recent ethanol or recreational drug use may modify presenting symptoms. Antiplatelets or anticoagulants may worsen bleeding and interfere with key blood tests. Shock in patients with pre-existing coronary artery disease can precipitate a myocardial infarction.

### Clinical challenges, controversies, and regional strategies in snakebite care in India [^114EYyzR]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2025). High credibility.

There is a pressing need for newer, more effective antivenoms, along with better diagnostic tests, particularly for managing envenomations by species like the H. hypnale. This highlights the importance of regional specificity in antivenom development, given that venom composition can vary significantly due to factors such as geographical location, seasonal changes, and even the snake's hibernation patterns. Table 1 summarises consensus statements, controversies, and research questions outlining the research priorities, offering a roadmap to translate expert opinions into actionable strategies for guidelines and policy.

Further research should also focus on addressing complications and developing treatment guidelines for special conditions especially capillary leak syndrome and VICC.

The integration of digital platforms for snake identification, the establishment of state-maintained registries, and the creation of common platforms for interaction and audit are crucial for ensuring standardised care and improving patient outcomes. Accurate snake species identification and the production of region-specific antivenoms are critical steps in reducing the impact of snakebites in high-incidence areas.

Although the number of experts involved in this study was limited, the panellists' combined experience of over 300 years in managing snakebite cases adds substantial credibility to the findings. Their diverse experience across various healthcare settings in India provides valuable insights, and we believe this model can serve as a template for future studies. However, the small sample size and reliance on expert opinion in the limited time frame of 90 min, may not fully capture the range of perspectives, particularly from practitioners in rural or under-resourced settings.

Another limitation of this study is the potential contextual bias introduced by the setting in which the data were collected, as the themes may have been influenced by the structured nature of the SBLS workshop. The focus on strengthening peripheral care through training could have overshadowed other critical aspects of snakebite management that were not as extensively discussed during the workshop. Additionally, while expert opinion is valuable, it may not represent the views of all practitioners, particularly in underserved areas. The under-representation of peripheral healthcare providers in the panel limits the study's ability to fully capture the unique challenges faced by practitioners in primary health centres and rural hospitals, despite efforts to incorporate audience queries into the discussion.

Snake bite — recommendation-specific supportive text emphasizes access to definitive care and minimizing exertion. The definitive treatment for snakebite is antivenom, which is not available for use in the first aid setting, and it is not practical to treat shock, internal bleeding, or severe neurotoxicity in the first aid setting; therefore, a person bitten by a snake that is venomous or might be venomous should seek prompt medical attention and transport by EMS allows delivery of supportive and stabilizing care before arrival at the hospital. A pit viper bite typically deposits venom intradermally or into the subcutaneous space, and in a human experimental study, flow of an intradermally or subcutaneously injected radiotracer increased when the subject walked for ≥ 10 minutes, which could lead to increased systemic absorption of venom.

How do patients present?

Patients usually give a history of being bitten by a snake, except those who experience painless nocturnal bites by kraits while asleep. Patients are often fearful and anxious. Occasionally, painful bites may be mistaken for a puncture wound from a thorn or sharp stone and be ignored initially. Some patients, especially children, bitten by highly venomous snakes, may present with cardiovascular collapse, unconsciousness, bleeding, paralysis, or respiratory failure and may not provide a clear history of snakebite. It is important to consider envenoming in these situations in regions where snakebites are common.

Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and headache are non-specific symptoms but must be monitored as these may herald serious complications such as uraemia, acute pituitary or intracranial bleeds, and anaphylaxis.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for pit viper envenomation, more specifically with respect to evacuation, WMS 2015 guidelines recommend to contact the nearest healthcare facility ahead of time, and if antivenom is unavailable, consider sending from another facility or immediately transport the patient to a different facility. Consider directly contacting a poison control center to coordinate this process.
