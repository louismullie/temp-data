## Question

At what age is zolmitriptan approved for use?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking at what age zolmitriptan (Zomig) is approved for use, including the specific age range and indication. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the current FDA labeling to confirm the indicated population and any explicit pediatric statements. Then, I should verify whether any clinical pediatric data change the regulatory status. Next, I will distinguish zolmitriptan from other triptans that do have pediatric labeling to avoid extrapolation errors. Finally, I will synthesize a clear answer with the precise age range and indication language from authoritative sources [^114J6DRx] [^1114qfko].

> Let me first confirm the FDA label, since that is the highest authority for approved use. The current U.S. Prescribing Information for Zomig states it is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults, and explicitly notes that the safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established and use is not recommended under 18 years; it also notes Zomig has not been studied in patients younger than 12 years, and an adolescent RCT did not demonstrate efficacy over placebo [^114J6DRx] [^1114qfko].

> Wait, I should double-check that this adult-only indication is consistent across FDA drug information repositories and not an artifact of one document. The Structured Product Labeling (SPL) drug information also lists zolmitriptan's labeled indication as treatment of migraine attacks in adults, with no pediatric indication, reinforcing that the approved population is 18 years and older only [^114jTise].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions based solely on labeling; I need to check whether pediatric clinical trials exist and whether they alter the regulatory status. There is a randomized trial of zolmitriptan nasal spray in adolescents (12–17 years) showing superiority to placebo on several endpoints, but despite these data, the FDA labeling still concludes pediatric safety and effectiveness have not been established and does not grant pediatric approval, underscoring that positive studies do not equal regulatory approval without sufficient totality of evidence and FDA review [^113B55VW] [^114J6DRx].

> But wait, what if I'm conflating zolmitriptan with other triptans that do have pediatric labeling; I should confirm those distinctions. Almotriptan is approved for acute migraine pain in adolescents 12–17 years, and the sumatriptan-naproxen combination (Treximet) is indicated for patients 12 years and older; these pediatric allowances do not extend to zolmitriptan, so extrapolating across the class would be incorrect for regulatory purposes [^115M69PK] [^115ySprq].

> Next, I should review guideline context to ensure there isn't a practice guidance that implies pediatric approval for zolmitriptan. Adult migraine guidelines list zolmitriptan among effective triptans for acute attacks in adults, while pediatric-focused guidance emphasizes limits on triptan frequency to avoid medication overuse headache and does not convert zolmitriptan's status into an FDA pediatric indication, which is consistent with the label [^116rXaZ8] [^112YrYQY].

> Final answer: I need to ensure my conclusion aligns precisely with the regulatory text. Zolmitriptan (Zomig) is FDA-approved only for adults 18 years and older for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura; it is not approved for patients under 18 because safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established [^114J6DRx] [^1114qfko].

---

Zolmitriptan is approved [^1114qfko] for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in **adults aged 18 years and older**. It is **not approved for pediatric use** [^114J6DRx] because clinical trials in adolescents did not demonstrate efficacy, and safety and effectiveness have not been established in patients under 18 years. For pediatric migraine, consider alternatives such as **almotriptan** [^115M69PK] (approved for ages 12–17) or **sumatriptan/naproxen** [^115ySprq] (approved for ages 12 and older).

---

## Approved age range for zolmitriptan

The **indication** is the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura [^1114qfko] in adults, and the **approved age** is 18 years and older.

---

## Pediatric use of zolmitriptan

- **Pediatric approval**: Not approved [^114J6DRx] for patients under 18 years.
- **Adolescent trial**: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial (ages 12–17) [^114J6DRx] did not show efficacy.
- **Younger children**: No studies [^114J6DRx] in patients under 12 years.
- **Safety**: Adverse reactions in adolescents were similar to adults [^114J6DRx]; no new pediatric-specific adverse reactions identified.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting adult approval

- **Adult trials**: Multiple randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials [^113zEdnp] demonstrated efficacy and tolerability in adults [^116rXaZ8].
- **Efficacy**: Significant improvement in headache relief, pain-free response, and sustained pain-free response [^113zEdnp] versus placebo [^111ySvxL].
- **Tolerability**: Generally well tolerated [^113zEdnp] in adults, supporting approval [^116rXaZ8].

---

## Clinical evidence for pediatric use

A randomized, placebo-controlled trial in adolescents aged 12–17 **did not demonstrate efficacy** [^114J6DRx]. No studies have been conducted [^114J6DRx] in children under 12 years. Adverse reactions in adolescents were similar to those in adults [^114J6DRx], and no pediatric-specific adverse reactions were identified.

---

## Regulatory considerations and guidelines

The **FDA stance** [^114J6DRx] is that zolmitriptan is not recommended for patients under 18 years due to lack of established safety and efficacy. The **AAN/AHS guidance** [^112YrYQY] advises counseling pediatric patients and families to limit triptan use to avoid medication overuse headache.

---

## Alternative migraine treatments for pediatric patients

- **Almotriptan**: Approved for acute migraine in adolescents aged 12–17 years [^115M69PK].
- **Sumatriptan/naproxen**: Approved for acute migraine in patients aged 12 years and older [^112brsaB] [^115ySprq].
- **Non-pharmacologic**: Behavioral therapy, lifestyle modifications, and trigger avoidance are recommended.

## Summary table: zolmitriptan approval and clinical evidence

| **Population** | **Approval status** | **Clinical evidence** | **Safety profile** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Adults (≥ 18 years) | Approved | Multiple RCTs demonstrate efficacy and tolerability [^113zEdnp] [^116rXaZ8] | Generally well tolerated [^113zEdnp] [^116rXaZ8] |
| Adolescents (12–17 years) | Not approved | RCT did not demonstrate efficacy [^114J6DRx] | - Similar to adults <br/> - No new adverse reactions [^114J6DRx] |
| Children (< 12 years) | Not approved | No studies conducted [^114J6DRx] | Unknown |

---

Zolmitriptan is **approved for adults aged 18 years and older** for acute migraine treatment [^1114qfko]; it is not approved for pediatric patients [^114J6DRx] because efficacy was not demonstrated in adolescents and data are lacking in younger children.

## References

### Almotriptan malate [^115M69PK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

Almotriptan tablets are a 5HT1B/1D receptor agonist (triptan) indicated for the acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults with a history of migraine, with or without aura. Additionally, they are used for the acute treatment of migraine headache pain in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with a history of migraine, with or without aura, and who have migraine attacks usually lasting 4 hours or more.

- **Important limitations**: Use only following a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. In adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, the efficacy of almotriptan tablets on migraine-associated symptoms was not established. The tablets are not intended for the prophylactic therapy of migraine and are not indicated for the treatment of cluster headaches.

- **Acute treatment of migraine attacks**:
	- **Adults**: Almotriptan tablets (almotriptan malate) are indicated for the acute treatment of migraine attacks in patients with a history of migraine, with or without aura.
	- **Adolescents age 12 to 17 years**: Almotriptan tablets are indicated for the acute treatment of migraine headache pain in patients with a history of migraine attacks, with or without aura, usually lasting 4 hours or more when untreated.

- **Important limitations**: Almotriptan tablets should only be used where a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient has no response for the first migraine attack treated with almotriptan tablets, the diagnosis of migraine should be reconsidered before the tablets are administered to treat any subsequent attacks. In adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, the efficacy of almotriptan tablets on migraine-associated symptoms was not established.

### Zomig [^114J6DRx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Lactation**:
	- The risk summary indicates that there are no data on the presence of zolmitriptan or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. In studies with rats, oral dosing with zolmitriptan resulted in levels in milk up to four times that in maternal plasma. It is important to consider the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding alongside the mother's clinical need for ZOMIG and the potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ZOMIG or from the maternal condition.

- **Pediatric use**:
	- The safety and effectiveness of ZOMIG in pediatric patients have not been established; thus, its use is not recommended for patients under 18 years of age. A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 696 pediatric patients (aged 12 to 17 years) with migraines did not show ZOMIG's efficacy over placebo. Adverse reactions in adolescents were similar to those reported in adults. ZOMIG has not been studied in patients younger than 12 years old. In postmarketing experiences with triptans, including ZOMIG, no additional adverse reactions were observed in pediatric patients that were not seen in adults.

- **Geriatric use**:
	- Clinical studies of ZOMIG did not include a sufficient number of subjects aged 65 and over to determine any differential response compared to younger subjects.

### Treximet [^115ySprq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Treximet is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. It is a combination of sumatriptan, a serotonin (5-HT) 1b/1d receptor agonist (triptan), and naproxen sodium, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, designed for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older.

- **Limitations of use**: Use only if a clear diagnosis of migraine headache has been established. Treximet is not indicated for the prophylactic therapy of migraine attacks or for the treatment of cluster headaches. If a patient has no response to the first migraine attack treated with Treximet, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before Treximet is administered to treat any subsequent attacks. Safety and effectiveness of Treximet have not been established for cluster headache.

### Zomig [^1114qfko]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Zomig is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults.

- **Limitations of use**: Only use Zomig if a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient does not respond to Zomig for the first migraine attack, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before administering Zomig for any subsequent attacks. Zomig is not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks. The safety and effectiveness of Zomig have not been established for cluster headaches.

Zomig is a serotonin (5-HT)1B/1D receptor agonist (triptan) indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults.

- **Limitations of use**: Use only following a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. It is not indicated for prophylactic therapy of migraine, nor for the treatment of cluster headache.

### Guidelines of the International Headache Society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: Fourth edition [^113ZX1Up]. Cephalalgia (2019). Low credibility.

- **Dose-response curves and dosage**: Recommendations include that dose-response curves should be clearly defined in early (phase I and II) randomized clinical trials of new chemical entities for the acute treatment of migraine. Efficacy- and tolerability-based minimum effective and optimal doses should be determined. Effective doses of a well-established or standard drug should be utilized in comparative clinical trials, unless clinically inappropriate, in which case a clear justification for the particular dose selection should be given.

	- **Comments**: New acute treatments for migraine should be tested against a standard comparator with established dose-response curves and optimal efficacy- and tolerability-based doses, such as rizatriptan, sumatriptan, or zolmitriptan; the CGRP receptor antagonists (i.e.g.epants) ubrogepant and rimegepant; or the 5-HT 1F receptor agonist lasmiditan. The accepted optimal therapeutic dose of the comparator should be used.

- **Route of administration**: Recommendations state that when pre-clinical and PK data demonstrate an acceptable PK profile in humans (i.e.g.ood oral bioavailability and rapid oral absorption), oral administration of the test treatment is recommended because the oral route is preferred by most people with migraine. Alternative routes of administration, including parenteral, inhalational, buccal, intranasal, and rectal, can be utilized as circumstances dictate (e.g. severe nausea, status migrainosus).

	- **Comments**: Gastric absorption of orally-administered medications can be delayed during…

### Timing of pediatric drug approval and clinical evidence submitted to regulatory authorities: International comparison among Japan, the United States, and the European Union [^116ZxUui]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Low credibility.

Many prescription drugs approved for adult use lack pediatric labeling information, resulting in their off-label use in children. Drug regulatory authorities have developed legal and regulatory frameworks to promote pediatric drug development. However, the state of pediatric indication approval and quality of efficacy evidence, which forms the basis of regulatory approvals, is unknown.

Here, we analyzed novel therapeutics approved in Japan, the United States, and the European Union during 2005–2014 to investigate the timing and frequency of pediatric indication approval, and characterized the design of pediatric studies supporting regulatory approval. We found that the United States and European Union experienced a higher frequency of supplemental indication approval in pediatrics based on better-designed studies than Japan. The speed and efficiency of pediatric drug development will improve by coordinating pediatric studies on an international basis. The results also implied the necessity for a robust system of postmarketing monitoring of pediatric efficacy and safety.

### Efficacy of zolmitriptan nasal spray in adolescent migraine [^113B55VW]. Pediatrics (2007). High credibility.

The goal was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of zolmitriptan nasal spray in the treatment of adolescent migraine.

- **Methods**: The "Double-Diamond" study employed a novel, single-blind, "placebo challenge" in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-way, two-attack, crossover design. A total of 248 U.S. adolescent patients (12–17 years of age) with an established diagnosis of migraine, with or without aura, were enrolled. A single-blind placebo challenge was used for each migraine attack. If a headache response to the initial placebo treatment was achieved at 15 minutes, no additional medications were taken; if migraine intensity remained moderate or severe, patients treated the attack with zolmitriptan (5 mg) nasal spray or placebo according to a randomized, crossover schedule (double-blind). The primary efficacy variable was headache response at one hour after treatment. A comprehensive range of secondary endpoints included sustained headache response at two hours.

- **Results**: A total of 171 patients (mean age: 14.2 years; 57.3% female) treated one or more attacks with study medication (intention-to-treat population). Significant pain relief onset was evident 15 minutes after treatment with zolmitriptan nasal spray. At one hour after the dose, zolmitriptan nasal spray produced a higher headache response rate than placebo (58.1% vs. 43.3%). Zolmitriptan nasal spray was also significantly superior to placebo in improvement in pain intensity, pain-free rates, sustained resolution of headache, and resolution of associated migraine symptoms.

### Zomig [^114c8qUE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Clearance of zolmitriptan was reduced by 25% in patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr ≥ 5 ≤ 25 mL/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function (Clcr ≥ 70 mL/min); however, no significant change in clearance was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment (Clcr ≥ 26 ≤ 50 mL/min).

Zolmitriptan pharmacokinetics in healthy elderly non-migraineur volunteers (age 65 to 76 years) was similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18 to 39 years).

- **Sex**: Mean plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan were up to 1.5-fold higher in females than in males.

- **Race**: Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data between Japanese and Caucasians revealed no significant differences.

- **Hypertensive patients**: No differences in the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were observed in mild to moderate hypertensive volunteers compared with normotensive controls.

- **Drug interaction studies**: All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of Zomig and a single dose of the other drug, except where otherwise noted.

	- **MAO inhibitors**: Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both Cmax and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the Cmax and AUC of the active N-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan. MAO inhibitors are contraindicated in Zomig-treated patients [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Drug Interactions (7.2,7.4)].

### Can we develop neurally acting drugs for the treatment of migraine [^115rmHS3]. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery (2005). Low credibility.

Serotonin (5-HT)(1B/1D) receptor agonists, also known as triptans, represent the most important advance in migraine therapeutics in the four millennia that the condition has been recognized. The vasoconstrictive activity of triptans produced a small clinical penalty in terms of coronary vasoconstriction but also raised an enormous intellectual question: To what extent is migraine a vascular problem? Functional neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies have consistently developed the theme of migraine as a brain disorder and, therefore, demanded that the search for neurally acting antimigraine drugs should be undertaken. The prospect of non-vasoconstrictor acute migraine therapies, potential targets for which are discussed here, offers a real opportunity to patients and provides a therapeutic rationale that places migraine firmly in the brain as a neurological problem, where it undoubtedly belongs.

### Practice guideline update summary: Pharmacologic treatment for pediatric migraine prevention: Report of the Guideline Development, Dissemination, and Implementation Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society [^112YrYQY]. Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for medication overuse headache, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, AAN/AHS 2019 guidelines recommend counseling pediatric patients with migraines and their families to use no more than 14 days of ibuprofen or acetaminophen per month, no more than 9 days of triptans per month, and no more than 9 days per month of any combination of triptans, analgesics, or opioids for more than 3 months to avoid MOH.

### Zoloft [^11468TQ7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Pediatric patients**: Sertraline pharmacokinetics were evaluated in a group of 61 pediatric patients (29 aged 6–12 years, 32 aged 13–17 years) including both males (N = 28) and females (N = 33). Relative to the adults, pediatric patients aged 6–12 years and 13–17 years showed about 22% lower AUC (0–24 hr) and Cmax values when plasma concentration was adjusted for weight. The half-life was similar to that in adults, and no gender-associated differences were observed [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

- **Geriatric patients**: Sertraline plasma clearance in a group of 16 (8 male, 8 female) elderly patients treated with 100 mg/day of Zoloft for 14 days was approximately 40% lower than in a similarly studied group of younger (25 to 32 year old) individuals. Steady-state, therefore, was achieved after 2 to 3 weeks in older patients. The same study showed a decreased clearance of desmethylsertraline in older males, but not in older females [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

- **Hepatic impairment**: In patients with chronic mild liver impairment (N = 10: 8 patients with Child-Pugh scores of 5–6; and 2 patients with Child-Pugh scores of 7–8) who received 50 mg of Zoloft per day for 21 days, sertraline clearance was reduced, resulting in approximately 3-fold greater exposure compared to age-matched volunteers with normal hepatic function (N = 10). The exposure to desmethylsertraline was approximately 2-fold greater in patients with mild hepatic impairment compared to age-matched volunteers with normal hepatic function. There were no significant differences.

### Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study of the safety and efficacy of ADAM zolmitriptan for the acute treatment of migraine [^113Vx4VZ]. Cephalalgia (2018). Low credibility.

The percentages of patients who were pain-free at the pre-specified time points of 30 minutes, 24 hours and 48 hours post-dose were 7.3%, 69.5% and 64.6%, respectively, for the ADAM zolmitriptan 3.8 mg group, and 2.6%, 39.0%, and 39.0% for the placebo group (nominal p = 0.1768 at 30 minutes and p < 0.01 for both 24 and 48 hours). The time course of pain freedom from 30 minutes to 24 hours is shown in Figure 2. The percentages of patients who experienced pain relief (improvement to mild or none), was also higher for the zolmitriptan 3.8 mg group than the placebo group at all time points (Figure 2). However, among the pre-specified time points of 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 4 hours, nominal significance was only achieved at 4 hours (nominal p < 0.0001).

### Guidelines of the International Headache Society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: Fourth edition [^117EDtQ2]. Cephalalgia (2019).

- **Age at entry**: Adult subjects participating in clinical trials should be between 18 and 65 years of age at entry. Only people who are at least 18 years old can provide informed consent. The inclusion of subjects older than 65 years is encouraged in post-marketing surveillance studies. After age 65, those with migraine are more likely to have (and be taking medications for) coexistent conditions than a younger population, which can confound assessments of safety and drug-drug interactions. Adverse health-related outcomes due to coexistent disease may be difficult to separate from a complication of the treatment under investigation.

- **Sex**: Males and females with migraine are eligible to participate in clinical trials of acute migraine medications. Migraine is at least three times more prevalent in females than in males. Special caution should be taken to avoid enrolling women who may be pregnant or lactating, unless they are the target of the trial. Partners of fertile-age women should practice effective contraception (refer to Section 2.3 for information about menstrual migraine).

- **Concomitant drug use**:
	- **Therapies not for migraine**: Trials allowing participants to treat conditions other than migraine should pre-specify the permitted uses of concomitant therapies (i.e. open or restricted). The use of contraceptive medication should also be pre-specified. In phase II clinical trials, subjects should not be allowed to treat conditions other than migraine unless pharmaceutical guidelines are followed.

### Common practical questions - and answers - at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^1168Qirm]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

What are my pharmacological choices for the management of aggression in a child with ASD when standard options seem to have failed? For some children, behavioral interventions combined with 'first line' medications such as those suggested above fail to alleviate symptoms. There may be several reasons for this, and it is crucial at the outset that these are explored. The diagnostic formulation may have missed an important aetiological factor, or previously identified triggers or perpetuating factors may have been inadequately managed. For example, an environment with certain characteristics, such as routine, predictability, and an appropriate level of stimulation, may not be available. Additionally, there may be an absence of adequately trained support staff, or staff may fail to follow behavioral recommendations. In these circumstances, it is crucial that medication does not become the perceived 'solution'. It is unethical for the psychiatrist to be expected to medicate where services are unable to meet needs.

On the other hand, there will be situations where challenging behavior continues despite attention to all identified aetiological factors. Such situations are most likely to arise in the context of non-verbal autistic children who are severely or profoundly cognitively impaired. While it remains important to continue to work towards a greater understanding of the behavior's underpinning, this is often very challenging. Medication may thus be considered as a least restrictive, best interest option in consultation with decision-makers. Additionally, the psychiatrist should…

### Zoloft [^112WK3fW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The effectiveness of Zoloft for the treatment of OCD in pediatric patients was demonstrated in a 12-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in a pediatric outpatient population (ages 6–17) (Study OCD-5). Zoloft (N = 92) was initiated at doses of either 25 mg/day for pediatric patients aged 6–12 or 50 mg/day for adolescents aged 13–17. The dosage was then titrated at 3- and 4-day intervals in 25 mg incremental doses for pediatric patients aged 6–12, or 1-week intervals in 50 mg incremental doses for adolescents aged 13–17 over the next four weeks, up to a maximum dose of 200 mg/day, as tolerated. The mean dose for completers was 178 mg/day, with dosing occurring once a day in the morning or evening.

Patients in this study had moderate to severe OCD (DSM-III-R) with mean baseline ratings on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) total score of 22. Patients receiving Zoloft experienced a mean reduction of approximately 7 units on the CY-BOCS total score, which was statistically significantly greater than the 3 unit reduction for placebo patients (n = 95). Analyses for age and gender effects on outcomes did not suggest any differential responsiveness based on age or sex.

### Zoloft [^111NuvFV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Clinical considerations:

- **Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk**: A prospective longitudinal study followed 201 pregnant women with a history of major depression who were euthymic while taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy. Those who discontinued antidepressants during pregnancy were more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than those who continued them. Consider the risks of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing antidepressant medication during pregnancy and postpartum.

- **Maternal adverse reactions**: Use of Zoloft in the month before delivery may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Fetal/neonatal adverse reactions**: Exposure to SSRIs and SNRIs, including Zoloft, in late pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, tube feeding, and/or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN).

When treating a pregnant woman with Zoloft during the third trimester, carefully weigh both the potential risks and benefits of treatment. Monitor neonates exposed to Zoloft in the third trimester for PPHN and drug discontinuation syndrome [see Data].

### Zembrace Symtouch [^1158XTRS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. ZEMBRACE SymTouch injection is not recommended for use in patients younger than 18 years of age.

- **Clinical trials**: Two controlled clinical trials evaluated sumatriptan nasal spray (5 to 20 mg) in 1,248 pediatric migraineurs aged 12 to 17 years who treated a single attack. The trials did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraines in pediatric patients. Adverse reactions observed in these trials were similar to those reported in adult clinical trials.

- **Oral sumatriptan trials**: Five controlled clinical trials (two single-attack trials, three multiple-attack trials) evaluating oral sumatriptan (25 to 100 mg) in pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 enrolled a total of 701 pediatric migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan compared with placebo in treating migraines in pediatric patients. Adverse reactions observed were similar to those in adult clinical trials. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose- and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older pediatric patients.

- **Post-marketing experience**: Post-marketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after using subcutaneous, oral, and/or intranasal sumatriptan. These reports include reactions similar to those rarely reported in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death.

The safety and efficacy of ZEMBRACE SymTouch for pediatric use remain inconclusive.

### Evaluating the triptans [^116Ur9fB]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The debilitating effect of migraines has fueled the search for more specific agents to treat its characteristic and associated symptoms. Second-generation oral triptans have shown an improved efficacy profile in comparison to the pioneer sumatriptan, as well as over-the-counter medications and prescription analgesics that have been staples of migraine treatment. Although all triptans exert effects through the 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B/1D receptors, each triptan has distinctive pharmacokinetic properties that determine its efficacy and tolerability profile.

Empirical findings based on clinical trials have led to associations between triptan pharmacology and efficacy. With the expanded treatment choices, the onus is on healthcare providers, especially primary care physicians who see the majority of patients with migraines, to determine which treatment has an efficacy profile that best suits the individual patient's needs. Patients prefer pharmacotherapy with a rapid onset of action that facilitates complete pain relief and no recurrence. Data from published comparator trials, based on commonly used efficacy endpoints and pharmacokinetic properties underlying patient-preferred outcomes, are reviewed in this article.

### Zolmitriptan for acute migraine attacks in adults [^113zEdnp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Migraine is a common, disabling condition and a burden for the individual, health services, and society. Zolmitriptan is an abortive medication for migraine attacks, belonging to the triptan family. These medicines work in a different way compared to analgesics such as paracetamol and ibuprofen.

- **Objectives**: To determine the efficacy and tolerability of zolmitriptan compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine attacks in adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Oxford Pain Relief Database, together with three online databases (www.astrazenecaclinicaltrials.com, www.clinicaltrials.gov, and apps.who.int/trialsearch) for studies up to 12 March 2014. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled studies, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm, using zolmitriptan to treat a migraine headache episode.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate risk ratios and numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial effect (NNT) or harmful effect (NNH) compared with placebo or a different active treatment.

- **Main results**: Twenty-five studies (20,162 participants) compared zolmitriptan with placebo or an active comparator. The evidence from placebo-controlled studies was of high quality.

### Millions of migraine attacks, many answers, more questions [^111dm3bZ]. Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

In the landscape of migraine treatment, many unanswered questions remain — particularly, which medications are most effective as acute agents and for which patients? Given the heterogeneity of patients, clinicians' practices, and the integration of new agents into migraine care, this is an ambitious question to address. At the same time, this question is crucial both because proper acute treatment is an important metric of quality of care and such treatments are woefully underused in the general population.

8.6 Patients with hepatic impairment

After oral administration of Zomig, zolmitriptan blood levels increased in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, and a significant elevation in blood pressure was observed in some of these patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Therefore, adjust the Zomig dose and administer with caution in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12)].

### Characteristics of efficacy evidence supporting approval of supplemental indications for prescription drugs in United States, 2005–14: Systematic review [^111sHHSu]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

The objective was to characterize the types of comparators and endpoints used in efficacy trials for approvals of supplemental indications, compared with the data supporting these drugs' originally approved indications.

- **Design**: Systematic review.

- **Setting**: Publicly accessible data on supplemental indications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration from 2005 to 2014.

- **Main outcome measures**: Types of comparators (active, placebo, historical, none) and endpoints (clinical outcomes, clinical scales, surrogate) in the efficacy trials for these drugs' supplemental and original indication approvals.

- **Results**: The cohort included 295 supplemental indications. Thirty percent (41/136) of supplemental approvals for new indications were supported by efficacy trials with active comparators, compared with 51% (47/93) of modified use approvals and 11% (7/65) of approvals expanding the patient population (P < 0.001), almost all of which related to pediatric patients (61/65; 94%). Trials using clinical outcome endpoints led to approval for 32% (44/137) of supplemental approvals for new indications, 30% (28/93) of modified indication approvals, and 22% (14/65) of expanded population approvals (P = 0.29). Orphan drugs had supplemental approvals for 40 non-orphan indications, which were supported by similar proportions of trials using active comparators (28% (11/40) for non-orphan supplemental indications versus 24% (10/42) for original orphan indications; P = 0.70) and clinical outcome endpoints (25% (10/40) versus 31% (13/42); P = 0.55).

Conclusions show wide variations in the evidence supporting approvals of supplemental indications for prescription drugs.

### Consensus proposals for the prevention of acute and delayed vomiting and nausea following high-emetic-risk chemotherapy [^112f6GBS]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

This paper uses an evidence-based approach whenever possible to formulate recommendations, emphasizing the results of controlled trials concerning the best use of antiemetic agents. We address issues of dose, schedule, and route of administration of five selective 5-HT(3) antagonists. We conclude that for each of these five drugs, there is a plateau in therapeutic efficacy above which further dose escalation does not improve outcome. Furthermore, for all classes of antiemetic agents, a single dose is as effective as multiple doses or a continuous infusion. The oral route is as efficacious as the intravenous route of administration, even with chemotherapy of high emetic risk. Selective antagonists of the type 3 serotonin receptor (5-HT(3)) in combination with dexamethasone and aprepitant are the standard of care for the prevention of emesis following chemotherapy of high emetic risk.

### Axert [^115ciyKz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

Axert® is a 5HT1B/1D receptor agonist (triptan) indicated for:

- **Indications and usage**:
	- Acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults with a history of migraine with or without aura
	- Acute treatment of migraine headache pain in adolescents age 12 to 17 years with a history of migraine with or without aura, and who have migraine attacks usually lasting 4 hours or more

- **Important limitations**:
	- Use only following a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established.
	- In adolescents age 12 to 17 years, efficacy of Axert® on migraine-associated symptoms was not established.
	- Not intended for the prophylactic therapy of migraine.
	- Not indicated for the treatment of cluster headache.

Axert® (almotriptan malate) is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine attacks in patients with a history of migraine with or without aura. It should only be used where a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient has no response for the first migraine attack treated with Axert®, the diagnosis of migraine should be reconsidered before Axert® is administered to treat any subsequent attacks.

In adolescents age 12 to 17 years, while Axert® is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine headache pain, its efficacy on migraine-associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia was not established.

### Double-blind clinical trials of oral triptans vs other classes of acute migraine medication - a review [^117HZCE7]. Cephalalgia (2004). Low credibility.

Although the migraine clinical trials literature is enormous, we identified only nine published double-blind studies that compare an oral triptan with a non-triptan acute treatment. Of the nine comparative trials that met inclusion criteria for this review, six compared sumatriptan with other drugs, zolmitriptan was studied in two trials, and eletriptan in one trial. In seven of the nine studies reviewed herein, differences between active treatments on the primary endpoints were not dramatic.

Experience in clinical practice suggests that, for many patients, oral triptans are superior to non-specific acute treatments, creating a discrepancy between clinical trials results and clinical practice experience. Four possible explanations for the disparities between clinical trials and clinical practice are likely:

- **Statistical power**: Statistically significant differences may not have emerged because the studies lack adequate statistical power.

- **Patient selection**: Patients treated with triptans in clinical practice may be relatively more responsive to triptans and relatively less responsive to other agents than those who participate in clinical trials.

- **Measurement of benefits**: Headache response at 2 hours, as measured in clinical trials, may not fully capture the benefits of triptans relative to other therapies, as assessed in clinical practice.

- **Timing of treatment**: Waiting until pain is moderate or severe, as required in clinical trials, may disadvantage triptans relative to comparators.

### New drugs in migraine treatment and prophylaxis: telcagepant and topiramate [^111JgwVU]. Lancet (2010). Low credibility.

Although triptan drugs provide effective relief from migraine for many patients, a substantial number of affected individuals are unresponsive to these compounds, and such therapy can lead to a range of adverse effects. Telcagepant represents a new class of antimigraine drugs: the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor blockers. This compound exerts its effects by blocking receptors for the calcitonin-gene-related peptide at several sites in the trigeminal and central nervous systems, resulting in pain relief. Telcagepant does not cause vasoconstriction, a major limitation in the use of triptans. Comparisons with triptans in clinical trials for acute treatment of migraine attacks revealed clinical effects similar to those of triptans but better than those of placebo. Telcagepant might provide hope for those who have a poor response to, or are unable to use, older drugs.

For patients who need prophylaxis due to frequent migraine attacks, topiramate is a first-line drug for migraine prevention in many countries; it is generally safe and reasonably well tolerated. Data suggest that topiramate could aid in the reversion of chronic migraine to episodic migraine.

### Tosymra [^115Dr7dq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Tosymra is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. It acts as a serotonin (5-HT1B/1D) receptor agonist, also known as a triptan, and is specifically used for the acute treatment of migraine in adults.

- **Indications and usage**: Tosymra is approved for use only when a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. It is not intended for migraine prevention or the treatment of cluster headaches. If Tosymra does not alleviate symptoms during the first treated migraine attack, the diagnosis should be reconsidered before using Tosymra for subsequent attacks.

### Treatment of childhood migraine attacks with oral zolmitriptan and ibuprofen [^113ReCVF]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

A double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study was conducted to investigate the efficacy of oral zolmitriptan in treating migraine in children and adolescents. Patients (n = 32) received placebo, zolmitriptan 2.5 mg, and ibuprofen 200 to 400 mg to treat three consecutive migraine attacks. The pain relief rates after 2 hours were 28% for placebo, 62% for zolmitriptan, and 69% for ibuprofen (p < 0.05). Both drugs were well tolerated, with only mild side effects reported.

### Guidelines of the International Headache Society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: Fourth edition [^116SMwLE]. Cephalalgia (2019). Low credibility.

In 1991, the Clinical Trials Standing Committee of the International Headache Society (IHS) published the first edition of the guidelines for controlled trials of drugs in migraine. Its goal was to improve the quality of controlled clinical trials in migraine by encouraging the use of scientifically robust methods in clinical research. To keep pace with developments in the scientific and clinical understanding of acute treatment, the Committee published a second edition of the guidelines in 2000 and a third edition in 2012. The commitment to continuous improvement has been recognized; the guidelines were considered in the 2018 guidance for industry prepared by the Division of Neurology Products in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and were adopted by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in a 2016 concept paper. This represented an important milestone in its formal revision of the 2007 guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of migraine.

Since the 2012 update, multiple new acute treatments have been developed, including small molecule calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists, serotonin (5-HT 1F) receptor agonists, triptan reformulations, and neuromodulation approaches. Accordingly, the Guidelines of the International Headache Society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: Fourth edition incorporates data from clinical trials conducted since the third edition of the guidelines was published, as well as feedback from meetings.

- **Controlled clinical trials**: Two controlled clinical trials evaluated sumatriptan nasal spray (5 to 20 mg) in 1,248 adolescent migraineurs aged 12 to 17 years who treated a single attack. The trials did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults.

- **Evaluation of oral sumatriptan**: Five controlled clinical trials (2 single-attack trials and 3 multiple-attack trials) evaluated oral sumatriptan (25 to 100 mg) in pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years, enrolling a total of 701 adolescent migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these subjects appeared to be both dose- and age-dependent, with younger subjects reporting reactions more commonly than older adolescents.

### Almotriptan malate [^114EEkUD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

- **Serotonin syndrome**: The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including almotriptan tablets, particularly during combined use with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). If concomitant treatment with almotriptan tablets and an SSRI (e.g. fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, citalopram, escitalopram) or SNRI (e.g. venlafaxine, duloxetine) is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. Symptoms of serotonin syndrome may include mental status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g. tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g. hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

- **Medication overuse headache**: Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g. ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to the exacerbation of headache, known as medication overuse headache. This condition may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in the frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache), may be necessary.

- **Increases in blood pressure**: As with other triptans, significant elevations in systemic blood pressure may occur.

### Are all 5-HT3 receptor antagonists the same [^112wmxZz]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2007). High credibility.

The 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists have become the cornerstone for preventing and treating chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Four 5-HT3 antagonists are commercially available in the United States, and numerous reports have been published comparing two or more agents. The studies ranged from randomized, double-blinded to open-label or retrospective trials; included chemotherapy-naïve and non-naïve patients; and covered a range of doses and routes of administration with and without concomitant steroids, for preventing and treating nausea and vomiting after highly and moderately high emetogenic chemotherapy.

With few exceptions, the studies uniformly show an equivalent efficacy rate and side effect profile among the various agents at equivalent doses. This article reviews the pharmacology of the class for insight into minor differences among the agents that could possibly influence drug selection for certain patients. It considers data on the absorption, half-life, metabolism, and receptor activity. Clinical trials support the claim of various guidelines that the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are therapeutically similar in safety and efficacy, particularly because the best practice for preventing nausea and vomiting after highly and moderately high emetogenic chemotherapy is a combination of a 5-HT3 antagonist, steroids, and aprepitant.

### Guidelines for controlled trials of prophylactic treatment of chronic migraine in adults [^111L3bEB]. Cephalalgia (2008). Low credibility.

In 1991, the Clinical Trials Subcommittee of the International Headache Society (IHS) developed and published its first edition of the guidelines on controlled trials of drugs in episodic migraine. This initiative was driven by the recognition that only quality trials can form the basis for international collaboration on drug therapy, aiming to 'improve the quality of controlled clinical trials in migraine'. With the trend toward large multinational trials, there is a need for increased awareness of methodological issues in clinical trials of drugs and other treatments for chronic migraine. These guidelines are intended to assist in the design of well-controlled clinical trials of chronic migraine in adults and do not apply to studies in children or adolescents.

### Triptan nonresponders: Do they exist and who are they [^112cEXQP]. Cephalalgia (2013). Low credibility.

Triptans represent the best treatment option for most migraine attacks, although this is not as well studied as it might be in controlled trials. Their efficacy and tolerability vary, both between agents and from patient to patient, with about 30%-40% of patients not responding adequately to therapy. As yet unexplained, the failure of one triptan does not predict failure with another, and therefore triptan nonresponders cannot be defined as individuals who have failed a single triptan. Five clinical studies provide evidence that switching from a triptan that is ineffective to a second one can result in effective treatment in a proportion of patients. Systematic studies investigating whether there are patients who do not respond to all triptans in all formulations are lacking.

- **Methods**: Here we discuss the importance of identifying triptan nonresponders, the literature supporting their existence, and the issues to be resolved to design trials to investigate this.

- **Conclusion**: So far, no scientific data about the presence of a triptan nonresponder population are available. We propose a pragmatic study design to assess the existence of this subpopulation, recognizing the complexity of the question and the likelihood that more than one issue is at play in nonresponders.

### Common practical questions - and answers - at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^112TVbcp]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)

Can I use SSRI medication to manage repetitive behaviours in a child with a diagnosis of ASD?

Repetitive behaviours are a core diagnostic component of ASD and are commonly observed among individuals with autism of all ages. These behaviours can take different forms: while for some they comprise 'functional' behaviours, such as the pursuit of interests, for others they may be less purposeful, such as ritualistic and repetitive motor behaviours. The decision to treat is fundamentally determined by the degree to which the behaviour impacts wellbeing and/or the ability to develop other skills.

The treatment of repetitive behaviours will largely be from a psychological/behavioural perspective. In some circumstances, however, these may be ineffective or otherwise difficult to implement; in such cases, medication may be considered. The Cochrane Review of 2013, which considered the use of SSRIs in the management of 'core' symptoms of ASD, found no evidence to support their use for ritualistic behaviours. A more recent systematic review similarly concluded that there is no evidence for the use of SSRI or other medications in the management of ritualistic behaviours.

This notwithstanding, when examining individual studies, there is some evidence to suggest that certain SSRIs, guanfacine, and risperidone — a D2, 5-HT2, and NE alpha-2 receptor antagonist — and buspirone, a 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist, may be effective. Given these data, it may be reasonable to consider an SSRI when other non-pharmacological treatments are insufficient.

### Guidelines of the International Headache Society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: Fourth edition [^112YmsdH]. Cephalalgia (2019). Low credibility.

- **Recruitment**: Investigators should recruit widely from the population expected to use the acute treatment being evaluated. For example, all individuals being treated for migraine at specialty clinics and primary care facilities should be considered for enrolment in clinical trials, as long as they meet eligibility criteria. Recruitment for phase II clinical trials may be more readily conducted in specialty clinics (where appropriate safety resources exist), whereas trials investigating generic or OTC drugs should try to recruit subjects from pharmacies and primary care facilities, as well as via newspaper advertisements. The inclusion of people who habitually participate in migraine clinical trials is discouraged. It is also recommended that investigators establish a database of the number of migraine trials of any kind in which a particular subject has participated in the two years preceding a clinical trial. Subject participation in earlier trials should be recorded and presented in the publication. Recruitment efforts and strategies should also be disclosed in the publication.

- **Publication**: Publication of trial results is necessary and should include all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints and all safety data, whether positive or negative. Before any trial-related activities are initiated, a Steering Committee (refer to Section 2.9 for details) should agree on timelines for publication and, if possible, include them in the protocol; a Publication Committee may also be formed. At the initiation of the trial or at the end of recruitment, a design paper with b

### Guidelines of the International Headache Society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: Fourth edition [^117D6n7s]. Cephalalgia (2019). Low credibility.

- **Number of attacks treated**: Determining the effect of an acute treatment on the first migraine attack should be the primary objective. The attack to be considered should be clearly specified in the protocol. If multiple attacks are treated, the first treated attack or the attack that will be considered for assessing the primary objective can be randomly selected.

In most clinical trials of acute treatment, the first treated attack will be used in the evaluation of efficacy. Refer to Section 1.2.12 for information about multiple-attack trials addressing consistency of response as a primary objective.

- **Rescue medication**: The use of rescue medication should be allowed at any time after the first primary efficacy time point, typically 2 hours after the initial administration of treatment. Use of rescue medication before the 2-hour endpoint should be considered a treatment failure unless an earlier time point for rescue was pre-specified in the trial protocol.

The time interval to using rescue medication can be reduced when the primary efficacy time point is before 2 hours, which is often the case in assessments of parenteral drugs or trials involving pediatric subjects. Little can be learned from delaying rescue medications beyond the primary efficacy time point. Furthermore, delays may unduly discomfort subjects and prolong the attack and associated disability, which are ethically unacceptable.

### SPL drug information for zolmitriptan [^111q8qa1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of zolmitriptan IN (also known as Zomig, Zomig):

- **Chest tightness, chest pain, neck pain, jaw pain**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as 5-HT1 agonists have been associated with an increased risk of non-cardiac chest pain and related symptoms.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as zolmitriptan has been associated with an increased risk of serious hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and anaphylaxis.

- **Increased serum zolmitriptan levels**: Use caution in patients taking cimetidine. Reduce zolmitriptan dose to 2.5 mg per dose, with a maximal daily dose of 5 mg.

- **Medication overuse headache**: Use caution in patients taking the drug for a prolonged period.

- **Serotonin syndrome**: Use caution in patients taking SSRIs, SNRIs, or TCAs.

### Characteristics of efficacy evidence supporting approval of supplemental indications for prescription drugs in United States, 2005–14: Systematic review [^116hgoKe]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to characterize the types of comparators and endpoints used in efficacy trials for approvals of supplemental indications, compared with the data supporting these drugs' originally approved indications.

- **Design**: Systematic review.
- **Setting**: Publicly accessible data on supplemental indications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration from 2005 to 2014.
- **Main outcome measures**: Types of comparators (active, placebo, historical, none) and endpoints (clinical outcomes, clinical scales, surrogate) in the efficacy trials for these drugs' supplemental and original indication approvals.

Results from the cohort included 295 supplemental indications. Thirty percent (41/136) of supplemental approvals for new indications were supported by efficacy trials with active comparators, compared with 51% (47/93) of modified use approvals and 11% (7/65) of approvals expanding the patient population (P < 0.001), almost all of which related to pediatric patients (61/65; 94%). Trials using clinical outcome endpoints led to approval for 32% (44/137) of supplemental approvals for new indications, 30% (28/93) of modified indication approvals, and 22% (14/65) of expanded population approvals (P = 0.29). Orphan drugs had supplemental approvals for 40 non-orphan indications, which were supported by similar proportions of trials using active comparators (28% (11/40) for non-orphan supplemental indications versus 24% (10/42) for original orphan indications; P = 0.70) and clinical outcome endpoints (25% (10/40) versus 31% (13/42); P = 0.55).

Conclusions from the study highlight wide variations in the evidence supporting. [Note: The conclusion sentence is incomplete and seems cut off based on provided text.]

### Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study of the safety and efficacy of ADAM zolmitriptan for the acute treatment of migraine [^111ySvxL]. Cephalalgia (2018). High credibility.

ADAM zolmitriptan 3.8 mg was superior to the pooled placebo group for the co-primary endpoints of the proportion of patients who were pain-free at 2 hours (41.5% vs. 14.3%; p = 0.0001) and the proportion who were free from their most bothersome symptom (MBS) at 2 hours (68.3% vs. 42.9%; p = 0.0009). ADAM zolmitriptan 1.9 mg was also superior to placebo for pain freedom (27.7% vs. 14.3%; p = 0.0351), but the comparison for MBS at 2 hours was not significant. Since both co-primary endpoints are required to be significant at the 2-sided alpha level of 0.05, the 1.9 mg group was not considered statistically significantly different from placebo. Additionally, all subsequent significance tests, including secondary endpoints, were not considered statistically significant. Any p-values provided are for descriptive purposes only, with nominal p-values shown.

- **Secondary outcome measures**: The proportion of patients who were photophobia-free, phonophobia-free, and nausea-free at 2 hours post-dose was higher in all ADAM zolmitriptan groups compared with placebo. In the ADAM zolmitriptan 3.8 mg group, 69.5% were photophobia-free versus 41.6% in the placebo group (nominal p = 0.0003). Corresponding values for phonophobia-free were 69.5% and 55.8% (nominal p = 0.0060). For nausea-free, the values were 81.7% versus 63.6% (nominal p = 0.0106).

### Almotriptan malate [^114HLjWv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

Safety and efficacy of almotriptan tablets in pediatric patients under the age of 12 years have not been established. The pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of almotriptan tablets have been evaluated in adolescent patients aged 12 to 17 years [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.2)].

In a clinical study, almotriptan tablets at doses of 6.25 mg and 12.5 mg were found to be effective for the relief of migraine headache pain in adolescent patients aged 12 to 17 years. However, efficacy on migraine-associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia was not established. The most common adverse reactions, with an incidence of ≥ 1%, associated with almotriptan tablet treatment were dizziness, somnolence, headache, paresthesia, nausea, and vomiting [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The safety and tolerability profile of almotriptan tablet treatment in adolescents is similar to the profile observed in adults.

Postmarketing experience with other triptans includes a limited number of reports that describe pediatric patients who have experienced clinically serious adverse events similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults.

Clinical studies of almotriptan tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Clearance of almotriptan was lower in elderly volunteers than in younger individuals, but no differences in safety and tolerability between the two populations were observed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Treatment principles in adults and development of patient-reported outcomes in cyclic vomiting syndrome [^112JVuRU]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome is a challenging disorder with a lack of effective treatment. Most medications currently available are not FDA approved, and recommendations are primarily based on open-label, retrospective, and cross-sectional studies. There is a critical need for the development of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) for future drug trials. Incorporating the patient perspective will provide the CVS community with valid and useful PRO/clinical outcome assessment (COA) information to aid patients, caregivers, and clinicians in making treatment decisions. Despite the many conceptual and methodological challenges that remain to be solved, PROs are an important component of CVS clinical trials and development moving forward. Addressing these obstacles will be important and necessary for improved patient outcomes.

### Comparison of rizatriptan and other triptans on stringent measures of efficacy [^117XZ1FY]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

To compare the efficacy of oral rizatriptan 10 mg with oral doses of sumatriptan, naratriptan, and zolmitriptan on stringent outcome measures, a retrospective analysis was conducted. This analysis used data from five randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked clinical trials. Oral rizatriptan was directly compared with oral sumatriptan 100 mg (n = 772), 50 mg (n = 1116), 25 mg (n = 1183), naratriptan 2.5 mg (n = 413), and zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (n = 580) for the acute treatment of a moderate or severe migraine attack.

- **Outcome measures**: The study evaluated the percentage of patients who were pain-free at 2 hours, symptom-free at 2 hours (no pain, nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, vomiting, or functional disability), and those with a 24-hour sustained pain-free response (no headache at 2 hours, no recurrence, and no additional antimigraine medications for 24 hours).

- **Results**: More patients taking rizatriptan 10 mg were pain-free at 2 hours compared to those taking sumatriptan 100 mg (40% vs 33%, p = 0.019), sumatriptan 50 mg (40% vs 35%, p = 0.009), sumatriptan 25 mg (38% vs 27%, p < 0.001), naratriptan 2.5 mg (45% vs 21%, p < 0.001), and zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (43% vs 36%, p = 0.041). Similarly, more patients taking rizatriptan 10 mg were symptom-free at 2 hours compared to those taking sumatriptan 100 mg (31% vs 22%, p = 0.002), sumatriptan 50 mg (33% vs 28%, p = 0.003), sumatriptan 25 mg (33% vs 24%, p < 0.001), naratriptan 2.5 mg (30% vs 11%, p < 0.001), and zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (31% vs 24%, p = 0.042). Additionally, more patients taking rizatriptan 10 mg had a 24-hour sustained pain-free response than those taking sumatriptan 100 mg (27% vs 23%, p = 0).

### Evidence-based review and frontiers of migraine therapy [^113ZQGo9]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

**Key points**: The past decade has brought groundbreaking advances in the treatment of migraine and other headache disorders. Novel therapies for migraine target the CGRP pathway, 5‐HT receptor subsets, and/or neuromodulation that interrupt the neurophysiologic mechanisms of the migraine attack. Newer therapies in migraine have resulted from a further understanding of migraine pathophysiology and may prove to be useful in the future treatment of cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) due to the potential overlap in the pathophysiology of the two diseases.

### Zomig [^1111nkev]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Zolmitriptan, the active ingredient in Zomig, is metabolized into an N-desmethyl metabolite. The concentrations of this metabolite are approximately two-thirds that of zolmitriptan. Given that the 5HT1B/1D potency of the metabolite is two to six times that of the parent compound, the metabolite likely contributes significantly to the overall effects following Zomig administration.

- **Excretion**: Total radioactivity recovered from urine and feces accounts for 65% and 30% of the administered dose, respectively. Approximately 8% of the dose is excreted in urine as unchanged zolmitriptan. The indole acetic acid metabolite constitutes 31% of the dose, with N-oxide and N-desmethyl metabolites contributing 7% and 4%, respectively. It should be noted that both indole acetic acid and N-oxide metabolites are inactive. The mean total plasma clearance is 31.5 mL/min/kg, with one-sixth attributed to renal clearance. This renal clearance exceeds the glomerular filtration rate, indicating renal tubular secretion.

- **Specific populations**:
	- **Hepatic impairment**: In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean Cmax, Tmax, and AUC0-∞ of zolmitriptan are increased by 1.5-fold, 2-fold (two vs. four hours), and 3-fold, respectively, in comparison to subjects with normal hepatic function. Notably, seven out of 27 patients exhibited elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure by 20 to 80 mm Hg following a 10 mg dose of Zomig. Therefore, it is imperative to adjust the Zomig dose in individuals with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

### Zoloft [^111mxfk3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In a pooled analysis of two 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible dose (50–200 mg) outpatient trials for major depressive disorder (MDD) (n = 373), there was a difference in weight change between Zoloft and placebo of roughly 1 kg for both children (ages 6–11) and adolescents (ages 12–17). This indicated a slight weight loss for the Zoloft group compared to a slight gain for the placebo group. For children, about 7% of the Zoloft-treated patients experienced a weight loss greater than 7% of body weight compared to 0% of the placebo-treated patients; for adolescents, about 2% of Zoloft-treated patients had a weight loss greater than 7% of body weight compared to about 1% of placebo-treated patients.

A subset of patients who completed the randomized controlled trials for MDD (Zoloft n = 99, placebo n = 122) were continued into a 24-week, flexible-dose, open-label extension study. Those subjects who completed 34 weeks of Zoloft treatment (10 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial + 24 weeks open-label, n = 68) showed weight gain similar to that expected using data from age-adjusted peers. However, there are no studies that directly evaluate the long-term effects of Zoloft on growth, development, and maturation in pediatric patients.

- **Alcohol content in Zoloft oral solution**: Zoloft oral solution contains 12% alcohol.

### Cyclic vomiting syndrome: Pathophysiology, comorbidities, and future research directions [^116Wahy2]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

It would be prudent to pursue trials of more recently approved agents with fewer side effects as potential prophylactic therapies. Newer agents such as NK1 receptor antagonists have been found to be effective in CVS in children and adolescents based on a single retrospective study and clinical experience, but there are no RCTs examining the efficacy in CVS in adults. Such trials would expand the treatment options available and enable us to better tailor therapy for individual patients. For instance, a patient who is obese may prefer not to use an agent that can cause weight gain like a TCA, versus a patient with profound weight loss who may benefit from such therapy. A single-center case series reported reductions in CVS episode severity and frequency with the antiepileptic drugs zonisamide and levetiracetam in patients failing tricyclic medications. Others have reported a beneficial impact of the antiepileptic medication topiramate when used as CVS prophylaxis. Data supporting these specific prophylactic measures are described in the preceding articles in this supplement of Neurogastroenterology and Motility.

Newer therapies that target CGRP receptors have shown efficacy in migraine prophylaxis in Phase IIb and III trials, and erenumab and fremanezumab have recently been approved by the FDA for this indication. These medications have not been studied in CVS but may be effective in those with or without migraine headaches given the strong link between CVS and migraine. Goals of future prospective investigations would be to confirm the utility of any of these.

### Triptan non-response in a London tertiary headache centre: What can we learn? A retrospective study [^114967sY]. Cephalalgia (2024). High credibility.

Triptans revolutionized the acute treatment of migraine; however, varied responses to triptans, as a result of poor efficacy and tolerability, are reported. A standardized definition of triptan non-response was recently proposed by the European Headache Federation (EHF). There is currently limited data available on the prevalence of triptan non-response.

We used clinic letters over a two-year duration to evaluate the triptan response and triptan efficacy or tolerability failure, or both, in a London-based tertiary headache service.

In total, 419 adult migraine patients (females: 83.8%, age: 46 ± 18 years, chronic migraine: 88.5%) were included in a service evaluation. In line with the EHF definitions, "triptan non-response" was seen in 63.8% of patients (264/414), whereas 37.7% of patients (156/414) had failed at least two triptans (EHF "triptan resistant") and 4.6% of patients (19/414) had failed at least three triptans, including a subcutaneous formulation (EHF "triptan refractory"). Notably, 21.3% of patients (88/414) had failed at least three triptans inclusive and exclusive of subcutaneous triptan use.

Advancing age (p < 0.001) and the presence of medication overuse (p = 0.006) increased the probability of triptan response, whereas an increased number of failed preventives (p < 0.001) and the use of calcitonin gene-related peptide monoclonal antibodies (p = 0.022) increased the probability of triptan non-response. The largest proportion of patients responded to eletriptan (49.5%), followed by nasal zolmitriptan (44.4%) and rizatriptan (35%).
