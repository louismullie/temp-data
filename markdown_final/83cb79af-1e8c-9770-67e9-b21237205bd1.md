## Question

How to avoid damage to normal pituitary gland during TNTS?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to avoid damage to the normal pituitary gland during transnasal transsphenoidal surgery (TNTS). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about preoperative planning and how imaging and endocrine profiling guide safe planes. Then, I should verify intraoperative visualization and navigation strategies that distinguish normal gland from tumor. Next, I will examine microsurgical technique and hemostasis to minimize parenchymal injury. After that, I need to check adjunctive tools like ICG, ultrasound, and rapid intraoperative pathology. Finally, I will review postoperative endocrine monitoring to detect and manage deficits early, and I will integrate special scenarios such as revision surgery and functioning adenomas, making sure each assertion is supported by data and that I correct any overstatements as I go.

> Let me first confirm the preoperative foundation, because missing this risks iatrogenic injury. High-resolution MRI with gadolinium is essential to map tumor boundaries, identify normal gland displacement, and anticipate cavernous sinus and carotid relationships, and a comprehensive endocrine evaluation both detects preexisting deficits and establishes baselines for postoperative comparison, which directly informs the surgical plan to spare viable pituitary tissue [^70d9c6cd] [^e3ea9177].

> Wait, let me verify the intraoperative visualization strategy. Endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery provides panoramic, close-up views that can outperform the microscope for identifying residual tumor and preserving normal gland, and in a prospective multicenter study of nonfunctioning adenomas, endoscopy was associated with significantly lower new hormone deficiency at 6 months compared with microscopy, suggesting better gland preservation when performed by trained surgeons, although operative times may be longer and there is a learning curve to navigate safely [^cb0b7f0d] [^62b59b9e]. Hold on, I should also note that some meta-analyses have not shown clear superiority of endoscopy over microscopy for all outcomes, so surgeon experience and case selection remain critical, and I need to emphasize that nuance rather than overgeneralize [^1263e8a5].

> I need to ensure we use navigation and Doppler judiciously. Neuronavigation correlates preoperative imaging with intraoperative anatomy to help avoid lateral drift and carotid injury, while Doppler can localize the internal carotid arteries in real time, especially in revision cases or cavernous sinus invasion where landmarks are distorted, thereby reducing catastrophic vascular injury that could secondarily compromise gland perfusion [^df6e07a5] [^463cea74]. But wait, what if the evidence base is limited for routine adjuvant techniques? The CNS guideline concludes evidence is insufficient to mandate adjuvant techniques universally, so I should frame these as risk-tailored tools rather than defaults [^ba8fa456].

> Next, I should review microsurgical principles that directly protect normal gland. Extra-arachnoidal dissection, midline orientation, and deliberate identification of the compressed normal pituitary rim are foundational; the normal gland is often thinned and draped around the adenoma, so I must avoid blind suction or aggressive traction and instead use gentle, directional dissection along pseudocapsular planes when feasible to separate tumor from gland [^1263e8a5] [^04e56afb]. Hold on, I should verify that pseudocapsular techniques are indeed linked to better endocrine outcomes; contemporary series and protocols emphasize pseudocapsular dissection to maximize resection while minimizing normal tissue loss, aligning with this approach [^bacd2d7a].

> I will now examine hemostasis, because thermal injury is a major avoidable cause of hypopituitarism. Bipolar coagulation near the stalk or normal gland can cause ischemic or thermal damage, so I should prefer mechanical hemostasis with hemostatic agents like Surgicel and avoid routine bipolar on gland tissue; if bipolar is absolutely necessary, use the lowest effective power and protect adjacent parenchyma [^c75300c0]. Let me reconsider whether any high-credibility source contradicts this; the endoscopic series and complication-avoidance frameworks consistently flag excessive bipolar near the stalk as a pitfall, reinforcing this conservative stance [^c75300c0].

> But wait, what if tumor and normal gland are indistinguishable intraoperatively. I should double-check adjunctive differentiation tools. Indocyanine green fluorescence endoscopy can reveal temporal differences in fluorescence between tumor and normal pituitary, helping define a safe resection boundary in select cases, though this remains investigational and should be used selectively by experienced teams [^ef774f49]. Intraoperative ultrasound has been explored to visualize residual tumor and normal anatomy in real time, offering potential for resection control, but it requires specialized probes and operator expertise and is not yet standard of care, so I should present it as an emerging adjunct rather than a replacement for meticulous visual dissection [^ce72bedc]. Rapid intraoperative optical coherence tomography and AI-assisted tissue classification are promising directions to reduce uncertainty when neuropathology is delayed, potentially preventing both undertreatment and overtreatment of normal tissue, but I need to be clear that these are early-stage technologies [^3d4e89bb].

> Hold on, I should verify that we are not overextending into risky suprasellar regions. For tumors with significant suprasellar extension and an hourglass constriction, blind transsphenoidal attempts to deliver the suprasellar component can cause hypothalamic or stalk injury; in such cases, a staged or combined approach, or even primary transcranial surgery, may be safer to preserve normal neuroendocrine function, and this risk stratification should be made preoperatively based on imaging morphology [^6e2bcfbe] [^a20cda93]. I need to ensure I emphasize that this is a selective, morphology-driven decision rather than a blanket rule.

> Next, I should review postoperative endocrine surveillance, because early detection of new deficits allows prompt replacement and improves outcomes. Morning serum cortisol on postoperative day 1–2 helps screen for new hypocortisolism, with a threshold around 15 μg/dL offering good sensitivity for predicting long-term HPA sufficiency, though dynamic testing at 6–12 weeks remains the gold standard for definitive assessment of each axis [^ac0196b8] [^ca62310b]. I should confirm sodium monitoring protocols as well; hyponatremia can peak around day 7 and is more likely when CSF leak occurred, so structured sodium checks for 7–10 days, including after discharge, are prudent to catch SIADH and triphasic patterns early [^c7b684b1] [^acda6b9f].

> Let me consider special scenarios, starting with revision surgery. Scar tissue and loss of normal landmarks increase the risk of misidentifying normal gland, yet series suggest that with careful technique, new hypopituitarism is not inevitable and may even be less frequent than expected, possibly due to a protective pseudocapsule; nonetheless, I should plan for longer operative times, use navigation, and maintain a lower threshold for subtotal resection when planes are unclear to protect function [^0bffa051] [^382483fe]. For functioning adenomas, especially Cushing's disease, I should confirm that early remission testing is recommended and that repeat surgery remains an option with counseling about higher hypopituitarism risk, which aligns with endocrine society guidance [^db99544c] [^2d10eb12].

> I should double-check that my synthesis aligns with consensus goals. The Pituitary Society explicitly lists preservation of normal pituitary function as a core target of pituitary surgery, reinforcing that every technical choice should be filtered through the lens of gland sparing rather than purely maximal resection, and that this principle applies across microscopic and endoscopic approaches when executed thoughtfully [^ba87b6e2]. Let me reconsider any overstatements: while endoscopy may reduce new hypopituitarism in some series, surgeon experience, case selection, and adherence to complication-avoidance protocols likely mediate much of this effect, so I need to avoid claiming modality superiority outside the context of controlled data and instead emphasize best practices that transcend tools [^cb0b7f0d] [^bacd2d7a].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, stepwise approach: preoperative MRI and endocrine mapping to anticipate anatomy, intraoperative panoramic visualization with endoscopy when appropriate, navigation and Doppler for high-risk anatomy, extra-arachnoidal pseudocapsular dissection with gentle technique, avoidance of bipolar near the stalk, selective use of ICG or ultrasound for tissue differentiation, and structured postoperative endocrine monitoring with early cortisol and serial sodium checks, all within a multidisciplinary framework that prioritizes gland preservation alongside oncologic control [^70d9c6cd] [^cb0b7f0d] [^c75300c0] [^ca62310b] [^e3ea9177].

To avoid damaging the normal pituitary gland during TNTS, **preserve the pseudocapsule** and use **gentle, angled dissection** to separate tumor from normal tissue [^bacd2d7a] [^c75300c0]. Use **endoscopic visualization** to identify and protect the thin rim of normal gland, and avoid excessive suction or bipolar coagulation near the stalk or gland [^cb0b7f0d] [^c75300c0]. Preoperative MRI helps define tumor–gland relationships, and intraoperative navigation or ultrasound can aid localization [^df6e07a5] [^ce72bedc]. Postoperative endocrine monitoring detects deficits early, enabling prompt replacement and improving outcomes [^ca62310b] [^e3ea9177].

---

## Preoperative planning and imaging

- **High-resolution MRI**: Essential to define tumor size, extension, and relationship to the normal pituitary gland, helping plan a safe surgical trajectory and anticipate anatomical challenges [^70d9c6cd].

- **Endocrine evaluation**: Identifies preexisting deficits and guides perioperative hormone management, reducing the risk of postoperative hypopituitarism [^579c3f12].

---

## Intraoperative surgical techniques

- **Pseudocapsular dissection**: Preserving the tumor pseudocapsule and using gentle, angled dissection minimizes damage to the normal gland [^bacd2d7a].

- **Endoscopic visualization**: Provides panoramic views to identify and protect the thin rim of normal pituitary tissue compressed by the tumor [^cb0b7f0d].

- **Avoidance of excessive suction**: Excessive suction can injure normal tissue; use gentle suction and avoid suction directly on normal gland [^c75300c0].

- **Minimizing bipolar coagulation**: Excessive bipolar near the stalk or normal gland can cause ischemic injury; use hemostatic agents (e.g. Surgicel) when possible [^c75300c0].

---

## Intraoperative adjuncts

Intraoperative adjuncts include **neuronavigation**, which helps localize normal gland and avoid inadvertent injury, particularly in complex or revision cases [^df6e07a5]. Intraoperative ultrasound can identify residual tumor and normal gland anatomy, aiding preservation [^ce72bedc].

---

## Postoperative management and monitoring

Postoperative management should include **early endocrine assessment** with morning cortisol and sodium monitoring to detect and manage new deficits promptly [^ca62310b]. Deficits should be treated with timely hormone replacement to prevent complications and support recovery [^e3ea9177].

## Summary of key strategies

| **Strategy** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Pseudocapsular dissection | Preserves normal gland architecture |
| Endoscopic visualization | Enhances identification of normal tissue |
| Gentle suction | Reduces mechanical injury |
| Minimized bipolar coagulation | Prevents ischemic injury |
| Neuronavigation | Improves anatomical localization |
| Intraoperative ultrasound | Aids identification of normal tissue |
| Early endocrine monitoring | Enables prompt detection and treatment |

### Pituitary adenoma consistency affects postoperative hormone function: a retrospective study [^60e7741f]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Aside from the mass effect-related damage on the healthy pituitary gland, anterior pituitary dysfunction can also derive from iatrogenic injuries involving the sellar region and is generally regarded as one of the most frequent complications of pituitary surgery, occurring in 5–25% of cases. Following surgical manipulation, postoperative hormone function largely depends on the state of healthy gland tissue. Hormone secretion can be preserved, or even improved, if enough healthy pituitary tissue is spared; conversely, the destruction of gland parenchyma generally results in the need for lifelong hormone replacement therapy. The endoscopic transsphenoidal approach has now replaced the microscopic technique as the preferred method for the resection of pituitary lesions, due to the improved visualization of critical neurovascular structures and the operating field as a whole, resulting in a lower chance of iatrogenic complications. Several endoscopic series have documented great variability regarding postoperative improvement in pituitary function, ranging from 21 to 63% of cases. Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis of 38 studies found no significant difference in the rate of postoperative hypopituitarism between the endoscopic and microscopic transsphenoidal approach. Of note, a new exoscope-based surgical approach has emerged as a promising alternative for pituitary surgeries; however, data concerning its impact on long-term complications, including postoperative hypopituitarism, are still scarce, further underscoring that endocrine outcomes following pituitary surgery are largely unpredictable.

Transsphenoidal microsurgery is a well-established neurosurgical procedure that has become the standard of care in the management of the majority of pituitary tumors and a select group of other sellar lesions. The safety of the procedure depends on the surgeon's adherence to certain anatomic concepts. Foremost among these concepts is the necessity of preserving the integrity of the arachnoid membrane covering the tumor dome and avoiding vascular injuries in the cavernous sinus. The objective of this article is to demonstrate the sequential steps of a transsphenoidal microsurgical procedure for the removal of a pituitary tumor in light of the anatomic concepts discussed, with the goal of preventing complications and achieving the best possible outcome.

### Transsphenoidal surgery [^ccd1847c]. Pituitary (2008). Low credibility.

Transsphenoidal surgery has evolved much over nearly 100 years. Initially operations were performed often without any input from endocrinology colleagues, and without preoperative imaging, operative magnification and illumination. Advances in the understanding of the biology of pituitary tumours, close co-operation between endocrinologists, surgeons and oncologists, and huge advances in imaging and surgical techniques have led to the evolution of the current transsphenoidal operation to the pituitary fossa to the point where a 'cure' is often possible with low complication rates. The indications, contraindications of transsphenoidal surgery will be discussed, together with nature of the surgical approach and how it can be applied to particular pituitary tumours and suprasellar lesions.

### How should a nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenoma be monitored after debulking surgery? [^528c0f90]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Transsphenoidal surgery is the treatment of choice for nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas but is seldom curative. Tumour progression rates are high in patients with postoperative remnants. Therefore, long-term monitoring is necessary to detect tumour growth, which may be asymptomatic or manifest with visual field defects and/or pituitary dysfunction. In view of the generally slow-growing nature of these tumours, yearly magnetic resonance imaging, neuro-ophthalmologic and pituitary function evaluation are appropriate during the first 3–5 years after surgery. If there is no evidence for tumour progression during this period, testing intervals may be extended thereafter.

### Transcranial surgery for pituitary adenomas [^41bd91b2]. Pituitary (2008). Low credibility.

Following a century of evolution and refinements in standard surgical techniques, the vast majority of operations for pituitary adenoma to date are performed utilizing transsphenoidal approaches. From current large series one obtains the impression that certainly less than 10% of these tumors require craniotomies. However, still several tumors, which's volume is mainly localized outside of the sella require transcranial approaches, of which the pterional and subfrontal routes are the most widely used. The goal of surgical treatment is rapid eradication of the tumor mass, decompression of visual pathways and elimination of hormonal oversecretion whilst preserving the normal gland and avoiding potential surgical complications. Even with microsurgical techniques and standardized approaches, there is still some mortality associated with transcranial approaches and morbidity is undoubtly higher than with transsphenoidal operations. However, a selection bias must be considered, which shifts tumors with a larger size, less favourable prognosis and higher complication rate into the transcranial series. Moreover, with extended transsphenoidal approaches, lesions have become accessible for transsphenoidal surgery, which previously have been considered as contraindications. In this article current indications and limitations for transcranial surgery of pituitary adenomas, the preoperative workup, surgical techniques, results, and complications are briefly reviewed.

### Current best practice in the management of patients after pituitary surgery [^308c0419]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Sellar and parasellar masses are a common finding, and most of them are treated surgically via transsphenoidal approach. This type of surgery has revolutionized the approach to several hypothalamic-pituitary diseases and is usually effective, and well-tolerated by the patient. However, given the complex anatomy and high density of glandular, neurological and vascular structures in a confined space, transsphenoidal surgery harbors a substantial risk of complications. Hypopituitarism is one of the most frequent sequelae, with central adrenal insufficiency being the deficit that requires a timely diagnosis and treatment. The perioperative management of AI is influenced by the preoperative status of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Disorders of water metabolism are another common complication, and they can span from diabetes insipidus, to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, up to the rare cerebral salt-wasting syndrome. These abnormalities are often transient, but require careful monitoring and management in order to avoid abrupt variations of blood sodium levels. Cerebrospinal fluid leaks, damage to neurological structures such as the optic chiasm, and vascular complications can worsen the postoperative course after transsphenoidal surgery as well. Finally, long-term follow up after surgery varies depending on the underlying pathology, and is most challenging in patients with acromegaly and Cushing disease, in whom failure of primary pituitary surgery is a major concern. When these pituitary functioning adenomas persist or relapse after neurosurgery other treatment options are considered, including repeated surgery, radiotherapy, and medical therapy.

Hollon et al. demonstrated that a combination of SRH and deep convolutional neural networks is non-inferior to traditional pathologist-based diagnosis and much faster. They showed how intraoperative cancer diagnosis can be streamlined, creating a complementary pathway for tissue diagnosis that is independent of a traditional pathology laboratory.

Our workflow, which obtained high certainty scores within minutes, is a substantial added tool to current workflows for intraoperative frozen section with H&E staining and interpretation from expert pathologists. Timely intraoperative pathology can enhance surgical effectiveness and contribute to informed surgical decision-making, with little downtime. For transsphenoidal pituitary surgery, difficulty differentiating between normal pituitary gland and pituitary adenoma in situations where access to neuropathologists is lacking can lead to undue damage to normal gland or incomplete resection of viable tumor. This could potentially be prevented by taking out a millimetric fragment of tissue, analyzing it almost instantly to know if it is normal pituitary gland indicating that the resection in that area is sufficient. On the other hand, if this tiny specimen turned out to be tumor, it would indicate a need to pursuing the resection. Furthermore, extending surgical time while waiting for pathology results, sometimes several times during a single surgery, may increase risks for infections or other intraoperative complications. It is estimated that every 30 minutes of increased surgical time increases the likelihood of a complication by 14%, in addition to increased costs.

Discussion

Transsphenoidal microscopic pituitary surgery

Transsphenoidal microscopic pituitary surgery is a time confirmed effective way of treating pituitary adenomas, as shown by the low incidence of complications in any clinical/practice setting according to the Ciric-sponsored survey of the late 1990s, although a statistically significant difference was noted in terms of better results in the hands of more experienced surgeons. Microscopic pituitary surgery relies on three-dimensional visualisation and thus on the ability to operate in three-dimensional space. Important conceptual nuances that need to be implemented in its execution to lead to optimal results are the recognition that the pituitary gland is a midline, extra-arachnoidal structure, and that the normal anterior pituitary gland is distended by the macroadenoma into a thin layer of tissue surrounding the pathology, whose preservation maximises postoperative pituitary function. Therefore, microscopic pituitary surgery needs to be extra-arachnoidal, to respect the principle of midline and needs to try to identify and preserve normal pituitary tissue.

Endoscopic pituitary surgery

Endoscopic pituitary surgery has been advocated for the surgical treatment of pituitary adenomas since the late 1990s on the basis of its panoramic improved visualisation and thus the ability to visualise structures easily such as the optico-carotid recesses and to access suprasellar areas visually that are not in the direct line of vision during microscopic pituitary surgery. This improved visualisation was felt to be theoretically associated with a greater extent of resection and improved safety, less invasiveness and potential better results — compared to microscopic pituitary surgery. However, endoscopic pituitary surgery is bidimensional and thus depth perception is missing, although manoeuvres have been recommended to minimise this drawback. The three surgical principles as described under microscopic surgery should also be applicable to endoscopic surgery.

Results of our study

Our study did not demonstrate any short-term advantages of endoscopic pituitary adenoma surgery. The review of the literature suggests an increased incidence of vascular complications associated with it. Recognising the limitations of a systematic review in coming to firm conclusions, it is conceivable that the greater incidence of vascular complications associated with the endoscopic transsphenoidal surgical technique is the consequence of either a more robust sphenoid exposure of the carotid optic recess with a greater potential for carotid artery injury, or the lack of three-dimensional depth perception during suprasellar manoeuvres. Indeed, the majority of vascular complications associated with the endoscopic technique involved suprasellar vascular injuries including intracerebral haemorrhages, midbrain stroke, mesencephalic haemorrhage, posterior cerebral artery laceration and internal carotid artery injury.

Complications

Complications of the endoscopic surgery have an incidence of 3.4–36.1%, and are mostly DI, anterior lobe dysfunction, and CSF leak (Table 8). Temporary DI is thought to be a result of temporary dysfunction caused by surgical trauma, and stretching of pituitary stalk by the falling diaphragm after the removal of the adenoma. In the current study, all the patients with DI were cured after treatment. The anterior temporary lobe dysfunction might be related with operation of the pituitary gland such as the excessive use of the aspirator in the sellae cavity, inappropriate manipulation and resection of the normal pituitary gland neighboring the adenoma tissue, and heat damage of bipolar coagulation in sellae cavity to pituitary gland. Thus, hemostatic Surgicel rather than bipolar coagulator should be used for hemostasis in vicinity of the stalk. In the macro- or giant adenoma, the pituitary tissue thinned by compression was difficult to distinguish from tumor and easy to be damaged when removing tumor, or the normal pituitary lie below the tumor and was also injured easily. Therefore, the relation between the tumor and normal gland should be carefully identified from the preoperative MRI image, in order to preserve the pituitary tissue during the surgery. The scraper ring was suggested to be used for adenoma resection because it could decrease the injury to normal tissue and diaphragm. The angled endoscope could be used, since it could facilitate the detection of the residual tumor and avoid damage of pituitary gland during the operation.

### Long term outcome following repeat transsphenoidal surgery for recurrent endocrine-inactive pituitary adenomas [^5b25bbdd]. Pituitary (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

While many pituitary adenomas are hormonally active and cause systemic symptoms by secreting hormones in an uncontrolled fashion, a large fraction of pituitary adenomas cause morbidity through local mass effect compressing the neighboring normal adenohypophysis and the optic apparatus. It is widely accepted that the standard first-line treatment for most endocrine inactive pituitary macroadenomas (EIA) is transsphenoidal surgery. Modern transsphenoidal surgery generally can achieve excellent tumor control rates, with a minimal amount of discomfort and morbidity.

What is less clear is what approach to take when these tumors recur, especially when this recurrence involves areas which are difficult to surgically remove tumor from, such as the suprasellar region or cavernous sinuses. Given that in most cases these recurrent tumors are usually not hormonally active, there is less of a clear indication for repeat attempts at curative or cytoreductive surgery. In many institutions, recurrent tumors are treated with repeat surgical resection, however, the evolution of less invasive treatments, such as radiosurgery and conformal radiotherapy, raises the possibility of avoiding a repeat operation, especially in cases where surgical cure is difficult or unlikely. These options become more appealing in light of the difficulties of repeat transsphenoidal surgery: the bony landmarks useful in maintaining a midline trajectory are frequently distorted and destroyed from the previous surgery, and there is frequently exuberant mucosal overgrowth and scar tissue in the surgical field, making orientation more difficult. Further, given that these tumors are not hormonally active, one could make the argument that many patients with recurrent tumors should not be treated at all, especially if the tumor is not surgically curable.

Our ability to determine the best treatment for these patients is most limited by the lack of long term follow-up data for patients undergoing repeat surgery at time of recurrence. Much more has been written about the management of residual or recurrent hormonally active pituitary adenomas where the appropriate management approach is largely dictated by laboratory data. The lack of definitive data regarding the risk and efficacy profiles of various approaches for treating recurrent EIA's is especially problematic given that these tumors are generally slow growing, and evaluation of the true efficacy of any treatment must take into account the possibility of very late second recurrences. We present long term follow-up for a series of 81 patients who underwent repeat surgery for recurrent non-secreting pituitary adenomas. Our aim was to delineate the safety and efficacy profile so that it can be compared to other treatment modalities.

### Intrasellar ultrasound in transsphenoidal surgery: a novel technique [^ce72bedc]. Neurosurgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Residual tumor masses are common after transsphenoidal surgery. The risk of a residual mass increases with tumor size and parasellar or suprasellar growth. Transsphenoidal surgery is usually performed without image guidance. We aimed to investigate a new technical solution developed for intraoperative ultrasound imaging during transsphenoidal surgery, with respect to potential clinical use and the ability to identify neuroanatomy and tumor.

Methods

In 9 patients with pituitary macroadenomas, intrasphenoidal and intrasellar ultrasound was assessed during transsphenoidal operations. Ultrasound B-mode, power-Doppler and color-Doppler images were acquired using a small prototype linear array, side-looking probe. The long probe tip measures only 3 x 4 mm. We present images and discuss the potential of intrasphenoidal and intrasellar and ultrasound in transsphenoidal surgery.

Results

We present 2-dimensional, high-resolution ultrasound images. A small side-looking, high-frequency ultrasound probe can be used to ensure orientation in the midline for the surgical approach to identify important neurovascular structures to be avoided during surgery and for resection control and identification of normal pituitary tissue. The image resolution is far better than what can be achieved with current clinical magnetic resonance imaging technology.

Conclusion

We believe that the concept of intrasellar ultrasound can be further developed to become a flexible and useful tool in transsphenoidal surgery.

### Transseptal subperichondrial endoscopic hypophysectomy with preservation of vital nasal structures [^f2eb7c5a]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pituitary surgery involving different techniques is often applied to the excision of benign adenomas. Operative interventions involved various approaches and techniques. Endoscopic transsphenoidal approach is the less traumatic route to the sella turcica, avoiding brain retraction, and also permitting good visualization, with lower rates of morbidity and mortality. Although mortality of pituitary surgery decreased by advances in surgical techniques morbidities such as synechiae formation, anosmia, bleeding, nasal septal perforations, drying, and incrustation due to traumatization of the nasal structures such as septum, nasal mucosa, and middle concha are the current problems in pituitary surgery. Here, the authors described an endoscopic transseptal subpericondrial hypophysectomy with minimal damage to normal anatomy and physiology and discussed advantages of this technique.

Methods

The authors performed endoscopic transseptal subpericondrial hypophysectomy to 2 patients and evaluated intraoperative and postoperative results.

Results

No complication was noted during surgery or postoperative period with endoscopic transseptal subpericondrial hypophysectomy technique.

Conclusions

Endoscopic transseptal subpericondrial hypophysectomy is a safe technique and, requires only a short surgery time and does not require the removal of any physiological tissue or cause any bleeding.

### Long term outcome following repeat transsphenoidal surgery for recurrent endocrine-inactive pituitary adenomas [^0bffa051]. Pituitary (2010). Low credibility.

Over one half of these patients presented with visual disturbance, and in this cohort we found that 39% of these patients experienced improved vision with a second surgery. More importantly, no one with normal vision (in whom the indication for surgery is less certain), suffered any appreciable decline in vision. Interestingly, leaving a small amount of residual did not appear to make a difference in long term outcome, as these tumors infrequently recur, and when they do, they seldom make vision worse. While 8% of patients with pre-op visual compromise had post-operative visual worsening, these cases were evenly divided between subtotal and gross total resection, suggesting that the visual decline was not necessarily due to overaggressive attempts to obtain a gross total resection.

Approximately, 35% of patients with pre-operative anterior pituitary dysfunction recovered function after surgery in our series, and no patient's function worsened. This is important to note, as at repeat transsphenoidal surgery due to scar tissue it can be more difficult to discern clear planes between tumor and normal gland than at the initial surgery, and as such, it wouldn't be unreasonable to hypothesize that repeat surgery would have a higher rate of hypopituitarism. This does not seem to be the case whether a gross total or subtotal resection is performed, or even if the patient receives external beam radiotherapy. Why this rate seems to be lower than published rates for initial operation is not entirely clear, but perhaps a pseudocapsule of scar tissue around the gland protects the normal tissue at repeat surgery.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^25eb19d5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperprolactinemia — surgery and radiotherapy for resistant or aggressive disease — We suggest that clinicians offer transsphenoidal surgery to symptomatic prolactinoma patients who cannot tolerate high doses of cabergoline or who are not responsive to dopamine agonist therapy, and for patients who are intolerant of oral bromocriptine, intravaginal administration may be attempted; for those who harbor aggressive or malignant prolactinomas, we suggest radiation therapy. There are no controlled studies regarding surgical outcomes in medically resistant tumors, and 7–50% of surgically resected prolactin-secreting tumors recur; surgery side effects include hypopituitarism, diabetes insipidus, cerebrospinal fluid leak, and local infection. Radiotherapy should be reserved for resistant or malignant prolactinomas, yields normalization of hyperprolactinemia in approximately one third, may require up to 20 yr for maximal effect and may never restore prolactin levels to normal, and is associated with hypopituitarism and, rarely, cranial nerve damage or second tumor formation.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^eb08ac86]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

3.1 Evidence

The decision to recommend surgery as initial therapy for a patient with a pituitary incidentaloma needs to be individualized (Fig. 1). Few data are available that specifically examine the outcome of surgery for incidentalomas. Some of the evidence considered in developing the recommended criteria for surgery was from transsphenoidal surgical series of symptomatic and often large pituitary lesions. From these data and based on the clinical experiences of the Task Force members, it is clear that substantial evidence supports the need for surgery for pituitary incidentalomas causing visual or neurological compromise. The presence of visual or neurological abnormalities due to compression of the optic nerves or chiasm by the incidentaloma is the strongest indication for surgery. Although the risks of not performing surgery on tumors that abut the chiasm or for those within certain proximity of the chiasm but where no VF abnormalities are present have not been quantified, in the Task Force's experience significant risk of future vision disturbance in these patients exists to warrant surgery. The age of the patient is also an important consideration. Surgery may be favored in younger vs. older patients given the higher lifetime probability of tumor enlargement in the former and the greater risks of surgical intervention in the latter group of patients. Some may elect to follow elderly patients with significant risks to surgery conservatively and closely for any deterioration in vision. The decision to recommend surgery should also consider whether future fertility is of concern to the patient. Difficult cases could also be discussed at a pituitary multidisciplinary team meeting when this is available.

Surgery is indicated in patients with apoplexy and visual disturbance. In a retrospective review of 30 subjects with pituitary apoplexy, the 20 who were followed conservatively had a similar long-term risk of hypopituitarism as those treated surgically. Therefore, patients with apoplexy and without visual compromise may be followed conservatively with serial imaging and hormonal assessments.

3.1 Values and preferences

Our recommendations for surgery for incidentalomas put a high value on alleviating or preventing visual or neurological compromise. Although the benefits of surgery in preventing future visual abnormalities are not known, a relatively higher value was put on the prevention of VF abnormalities than on avoiding the morbidity (e.g. diabetes insipidus, hypopituitarism) and the cost of surgery. New hypopituitarism as a result of transsphenoidal surgery is rare in the Task Force's experience, but the risk should be considered in the clinical context of the particular patient.

Pituitary Society Delphi Survey — postoperative endocrine evaluation after transsphenoidal surgery includes monitoring sodium and early cortisol, timed full reassessment of pituitary axes, and targeted dynamic testing. Serum sodium should be monitored postoperatively, and morning serum cortisol should be monitored postoperatively (during an interval of 1–5 days postoperatively). Full evaluation of pituitary function should be conducted 6–12 weeks after transsphenoidal surgery. Dynamic testing should be obtained to evaluate the pituitary adrenal axis at 6–12 weeks postoperatively, if morning serum cortisol is not sufficiently high to assure sufficient adrenal function early postoperatively. Thyroid function should be assessed in all patients postoperatively (at 6–8 weeks), and dynamic testing may be obtained to assess GH secretion postoperatively in patients with clinical suspicion of GH deficiency.

### MRI-negative Cushing's disease: management strategy and outcomes in 15 cases utilizing a pure endoscopic endonasal approach [^aa2b3da0]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

The standard of care for MRI-negative CD is highly disputed. There is evidence suggesting surgical exploration is more problematic than watchful waiting, or that it is not indicated in MRI-negative CD. Many advancements have led to the widespread adoption of transsphenoidal approach during the last three decades, especially the endoscope. Regardless of the width or depth of access, the endoscopic approach allows the surgeon to have a large panoramic view. Many cases in the literature have reported successfully treating functional pituitary tumors via endoscopic surgery. The results suggest that they are on par with, if not superior to, traditional microscopic approaches. When patients were operated on utilizing a microscopic technique assisted by a pre-operative ACTH gradient, the overall rate of partial adenomectomy (partial hypophysectomy) was 30%, including 19% in patients with positive MRIs and 40% in those with negative MRIs. However, endoscopic visualization of pituitary adenomas has allowed for the need for partial adenomectomy to be reduced to less than 2%, limiting the damage to the normal pituitary gland during operation. A recently published meta-analysis demonstrated that although there was no statistically significant differences between EETS and microscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery in the sub-analysis with regards to recurrence rate, remission rate, and persistence rate, the recurrence rate in the microscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery group was almost three times higher than in the EETS group. As a result, EETS appears to be a possible suggested therapeutic method, while more studies are needed to establish the therapeutic method of choice.

### Management of non-functioning pituitary adenomas: surgery [^70d9c6cd]. Pituitary (2018). Low credibility.

Non-functional pituitary adenomas (NFPAs) are benign tumors of the pituitary gland that do not over-secrete hormonal products, therefore, they are generally detected through symptoms of mass effect, including headache, vision loss, or hypopituitarism. There are multiple pathological subtypes of NFPAs, such as null cell adenomas, silent gonadotrophs, silent somatotrophs, silent corticotrophs, and silent subtype 3, all of which can be classified based on immunohistochemical studies and electron microscopy. Despite these numerous pathological subtypes, surgical resection remains the first-line treatment for NFPAs. Diagnosis is best made using high resolution MRI brain with and without gadolinium contrast, which is also helpful in determining the extent of invasion of the tumor and recognizing necessary sinonasal anatomy prior to surgery. Additional pre-operative work-up should include full laboratory endocrine evaluation with replacement of hormone deficiencies, and ideally, full neuro-ophthalmologic exam. Although transcranial surgical approaches to the pituitary gland can be performed, the most common approach used is the transnasal transsphenoidal approach with endoscopic or microscopic visualization. This approach avoids retraction of the brain and cranial nerves during tumor removal. Surgery for symptoms caused by mass effect, including headaches and visual loss, are successfully treated with surgical resection, resulting in improvement in pre-operative symptoms as high as 90% in some reports. Although the risk of complications is low, major and minor events, such as permanent hypopituitarism, persistent CSF leak, and carotid artery injury can occur at rates ranging from zero to about 9%.

### Transsphenoidal approach in endoscopic endonasal surgery for skull base lesions: what radiologists and surgeons need to know [^df6e07a5]. Radiographics (2015). Low credibility.

In the last 2 decades, endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery has become the most popular choice of neurosurgeons and otolaryngologists to treat lesions of the skull base, with minimal invasiveness, lower incidence of complications, and lower morbidity and mortality rates compared with traditional approaches. The transsphenoidal route is the surgical approach of choice for most sellar tumors because of the relationship of the sphenoid bone to the nasal cavity below and the pituitary gland above. More recently, extended approaches have expanded the indications for transsphenoidal surgery by using different corridors leading to specific target areas, from the crista galli to the spinomedullary junction. Computer-assisted surgery is an evolving technology that allows real-time anatomic navigation during endoscopic surgery by linking preoperative triplanar radiologic images and intraoperative endoscopic views, thus helping the surgeon avoid damage to vital structures. Preoperative computed tomography is the preferred modality to show bone landmarks and vascular structures. Radiologists play an important role in surgical planning by reporting extension of sphenoid pneumatization, recesses and septations of the sinus, and other relevant anatomic variants. Radiologists should understand the relationships of the sphenoid bone and skull base structures, anatomic variants, and image-guided neuronavigation techniques to prevent surgical complications and allow effective treatment of skull base lesions with the endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach.

This surgery is contraindicated in patients with tumors with a significant suprasellar extension and an hourglass-shaped narrowing between the intrasellar and suprasellar component because blind attempts to reach the suprasellar tumor may lead to cerebral damage. In addition, an infection in the sphenoid sinus is a potential contraindication to the transsphenoidal approach. Treatment of Adrenocorticotropic Hormone–Producing Pituitary Tumors Treatment Options for Adrenocorticotropic Hormone –Producing Pituitary Tumors Treatment options for ACTH-producing pituitary tumors include:

- Surgery.
- Surgery plus radiation therapy.
- Radiation therapy.
- Steroidogenesis inhibitors, including mitotane, metyrapone, ketoconazole, and aminoglutethimide.
- Stereotactic radiation surgery. Microadenomectomy or macroadenoma decompression is approached transsphenoidally in most patients.

Increasingly, endoscopic surgery is used to allow the entire surgical field to be viewed and to allow tumor tissue that would otherwise be inaccessible with rigid instruments to be safely resected. However, normalization of GH levels is not often achieved. Increasingly, adjuvant radiation therapy is reserved for tumors that extend beyond the safe operative area and appear to pose an ongoing threat. Treatment of Thyrotropin-Producing Tumors Treatment Options for Thyrotropin-Producing Tumors Treatment options for thyrotropin-producing tumors include:

- Surgery, with or without adjuvant radiation therapy.
- Somatostatin analogues, such as octreotide. Transsphenoidal surgery is the treatment of choice for patients with thyrotropic adenomas. Adjuvant radiation therapy may be used when surgery is known to be noncurative, even if the patient is still euthyroid.

This is because relapse is inevitable, and the full effect of radiation therapy requires months or years. Medical therapy may be required for patients who still have hyperthyroid symptoms despite surgery and external radiation. Somatostatin analogues are the treatment of choice, but their efficacy may wane with time.

### Transsphenoidal pituitary adenoma resection: do early post-operative cortisol levels predict permanent long-term hypocortisolism? [^b7764ff0]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tumors of the pituitary gland account for approximately 15% of all intracranial tumors and the benign pituitary adenoma represent the most common encountered entity (up to 85%) of all sellar lesions. The transnasal transsphenoidal (TSS) operative resection of sellar tumors has firstly been described in 1907 by Schlofer et al. and further developed by Cushing et al. in 1909. Nowadays, TSS is considered the most appropriate and initial approach for treatment of tumors of the pituitary gland. It can reduce hospital costs by shortening the length of hospital stay (LOH) and presents a safe and effective surgical resection option with fewer complications and better clinical out-comes than the transcranial route.

Pituitary adenoma patients may present with mass effect and lead to a compression of the optic chiasm with visual field defects and impaired visual acuity. As the pituitary gland plays a pivotal role in hormone regulation, adenomas can lead to an impaired adrenal pituitary function or hormone hypersecretion such as Acromegaly or M. Cushing due to a hypersecretion of growth hormone (GH) or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).

Most important is the preservation of an intact hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal-axis (HPA) regulating in a circadian rhythm and depending on physical stress levels cortisol release through the stimulation of ACTH. Therefore, patients need to be monitored closely for symptoms of hypocortisolism, the most dangerous and life-threatening complication of pituitary deficiency, presenting with impaired metabolism such as anorexia, fatigue, hypotension and nausea, and potentially leading to the lethal adrenal crisis including shock and volume depletion called Addison's crisis. Many studies have focused on the optimal serum cortisol threshold (or cut-off value) to determine whether a patient suffers from hypocortisolism or not, and to prevent patients from adrenal corticotropic deficiency by substituting hydrocortisone. Oral hydrocortisone, the generic pharmaceutical name of cortisol, has a plasma half-life of 1.5 h, a biologic half-life of 8–12 h, and a glucocorticoid potency of 0.8. Minimum serum values range from 4 to 20 μg/dl (morning serum level, 1 µg/dl = 27,59 nmol/l), but only few conducted studies have been performed and published with a long enough follow-up to establish cortisol supplementation criteria.

### Management of Cushing disease [^4f7c0271]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2011). Medium credibility.

Cushing disease is caused by a corticotroph tumor of the pituitary gland. Patients with Cushing disease are usually treated with transsphenoidal surgery, as this approach leads to remission in 70–90% of cases and is associated with low morbidity when performed by experienced pituitary gland surgeons. Nonetheless, among patients in postoperative remission, the risk of recurrence of Cushing disease could reach 20–25% at 10 years after surgery. Patients with persistent or recurrent Cushing disease might, therefore, benefit from a second pituitary operation (which leads to remission in 50–70% of cases), radiation therapy to the pituitary gland or bilateral adrenalectomy. Remission after radiation therapy occurs in ∼85% of patients with Cushing disease after a considerable latency period. Interim medical therapy is generally advisable after patients receive radiation therapy because of the long latency period. Bilateral adrenalectomy might be considered in patients who do not improve following transsphenoidal surgery, particularly patients who are very ill and require rapid control of hypercortisolism, or those wishing to avoid the risk of hypopituitarism associated with radiation therapy. Adrenalectomized patients require lifelong adrenal hormone replacement and are at risk of Nelson syndrome. The development of medical therapies with improved efficacy might influence the management of this challenging condition.

### Reported outcomes in transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenomas: a systematic review [^aba4fc31]. Pituitary (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Transsphenoidal surgery is an established treatment for pituitary adenomas. We examined outcomes and time points following transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenoma to identify reporting heterogeneity within the literature.

Methods

A systematic review of studies that reported outcomes for transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenoma 1990–2021 were examined. The protocol was registered a priori and adhered to the PRISMA statement. Studies in English with > 10 patients (prospective) or > 500 patients (retrospective) were included.

Results

178 studies comprising 427,659 patients were included. 91 studies reported 2 or more adenoma pathologies within the same study; 53 studies reported a single pathology. The most common adenomas reported were growth hormone-secreting (n = 106), non-functioning (n = 101), and ACTH-secreting (n = 95); 27 studies did not state a pathology. Surgical complications were the most reported outcome (n = 116, 65%). Other domains included endocrine (n = 104, 58%), extent of resection (n = 81, 46%), ophthalmic (n = 66, 37%), recurrence (n = 49, 28%), quality of life (n = 25, 19%); and nasal (n = 18, 10%). Defined follow up time points were most reported for endocrine (n = 56, 31%), extent of resection (n = 39, 22%), and recurrence (n = 28, 17%). There was heterogeneity in the follow up reported for all outcomes at different time points: discharge (n = 9), < 30 days (n = 23), < 6 months (n = 64), < 1 year (n = 23), and > 1 year (n = 69).

Conclusion

Outcomes and follow up reported for transsphenoidal surgical resection of pituitary adenoma are heterogenous over the last 30 years. This study highlights the necessity to develop a robust, consensus-based, minimum, core outcome set. The next step is to develop a Delphi survey of essential outcomes, followed by a consensus meeting of interdisciplinary experts. Patient representatives should also be included. An agreed core outcome set will enable homogeneous reporting and meaningful research synthesis, ultimately improving patient care.

### Advancement in perioperative management of pituitary adenomas-current concepts and best practices [^e3ea9177]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2024). Medium credibility.

Pituitary adenomas are very common representing 18.1% of all brain tumors and are the second most common brain pathology. Transsphenoidal surgery is the mainstay of treatment for all pituitary adenomas except for prolactinomas which are primarily treated medically with dopamine agonists. A thorough endocrine evaluation of pituitary adenoma preoperatively is crucial to identify hormonal compromise caused by the large sellar mass, identifying prolactin-producing tumors and comorbidities associated with Cushing and acromegaly to improve patient care and outcome. Transsphenoidal surgery is relatively safe in the hands of experienced surgeons, but still carries a substantial risk of causing hypopituitarism that required close follow-up in the immediate postoperative period to decrease mortality. A multidisciplinary team approach with endocrinologists, ophthalmologists, and neurosurgeons is the cornerstone in the perioperative management of pituitary adenomas.

### Pituitary surgery: transsphenoidal approach [^4e1bdf2b]. Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

THE TRANSSPHENOIDAL APPROACH for sellar tumors has evolved significantly since it was described initially during the first decade of the 20th century. The approach currently incorporates technological advancements and refinements in patient selection, operative technique, and postoperative care. Although many of these innovations are considered indispensable, the operative technique, as performed by contemporary neurosurgeons, is not standardized. This variability is a reflection of surgeon's preference, the lessons of experience, and the bias inherent in neurosurgical training. The methods and preferences described herein embody the distillation of an experience gained from 3900 transsphenoidal operations.

### Principles of pituitary surgery [^ec992099]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Since the description of a transnasal approach for treatment of pituitary tumors, transsphenoidal surgery has undergone continuous development. Hirsch developed a lateral endonasal approach before simplifying it to a transseptal approach. Cushing approached pituitary tumors using a transsphenoidal approach but transitioned to the transcranial route. Transsphenoidal surgery was not "rediscovered" until Hardy introduced the surgical microscope. An endoscopic transsphenoidal approach for pituitary tumors has been reported and further advanced. We describe the principles of pituitary surgery including the key elements of surgical decision making and discuss the technical nuances distinguishing the endoscopic from the microscopic approach.

### Endoscopic vs. microscopic transsphenoidal surgery for Cushing's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4d90d409]. Pituitary (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cushing's disease is caused by an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary adenoma, with an estimated incidence of 1.2–2.4 per million each year. The resulting excess of glucocorticoids induces insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, central obesity, hypercoagulability, and increases the risk of osteoporosis, hypertension, and neuropsychiatric disorders. First-choice treatment for Cushing's disease is transsphenoidal pituitary surgery, with selective adenoma removal. Despite biochemical cure, mortality risk in Cushing's disease patients remains increased.

Two main techniques have been used for transsphenoidal pituitary surgery: microscopic and endoscopic surgery. Furthermore, the microscopic and endoscopic techniques have been used in combination, in which the endoscope was used to visually confirm findings of the microscope. The microscopic technique was the established method to perform transsphenoidal surgery, until the first reports on endoscopic pituitary surgery were published, starting in 1992. With the operating microscope, intraoperative differentiation of pathologic tissue from normal tissue is achieved by providing three-dimensional vision in a direct line to the pituitary. Endoscopic pituitary surgery provides a broader field of vision using endoscopes with various angles in close proximity to the pituitary, however losing the three-dimensional vision and thus depth perception. From the introduction of the endoscope in transsphenoidal surgery, most surgical centers have chosen for microscopy or endoscopy. Only few small cohort studies have compared the microscopic and endoscopic surgical techniques in Cushing's disease performed in the same center. No clear differences in remission rate or surgical morbidity between microscopic and endoscopic surgery could be shown. However, the studies had only limited statistical power.

### Postoperative assessment of the patient after transsphenoidal pituitary surgery [^39222216]. Pituitary (2008). Low credibility.

While most transsphenoidal pituitary surgery is accomplished without complication, monitoring is required postoperatively for a set of disorders that are specific to this surgery. Postoperative assessments are tailored to the early and later postoperative periods. In the early period, which spans the first few weeks after surgery, both monitoring of anterior and posterior pituitary function and managing neurosurgical issues are the focus of care. Potential disruption of pituitary-adrenal function is covered with perioperative glucocorticoids. Various strategies exist for ensuring the integrity of this axis, but typically this is done by measuring a morning cortisol on the 2nd or 3rd postoperative days. Patients with levels < 10 microg/l should continue therapy with reassessment in the later postoperative period. Monitoring for water imbalances, which are due to deficiency or excess of ADH (DI or SIADH, respectively), is accomplished by continuous accounting of fluid intake, urine output and specific gravities coupled with daily serum electrolyte measurements. DI is characterized by excess volumes of inappropriately dilute urine, which can lead to hypernatremia. Most patients maintain adequate fluid intake and euvolemia, but desmopressin therapy is required for some. SIADH, which peaks in incidence on 7th postoperative day, presents with hyponatremia that can be severe and symptomatic. Management consists of fluid restriction. Neurosurgical monitoring is primarily for disturbances in vision or neurological function, and although uncommon, for CSF leak and infections such as meningitis. In the later postoperative period, the adrenal, thyroid and gonadal axes are assessed. New persistent hypopituitarism is rare when transsphenoidal surgery is performed by an experienced surgeon. Various strategies are available for assessing each axis and for providing replacement therapy in patients with deficiencies. Long term monitoring with assessments of visual, neurological and pituitary function coupled with pituitary imaging is necessary for all patients who have undergone surgery, irrespective of the hormone status of their tumors.

### Complication avoidance protocols in endoscopic pituitary adenoma surgery: a retrospective cohort study in 514 patients [^bacd2d7a]. Pituitary (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pituitary adenomas are the third most common primary intracranial tumor accounting for approximately 15% of all intracranial tumors, and surgical resection is considered first-line therapy for all adenoma subtypes except prolactinomas. Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery dates back over a century, becoming well-established with overall excellent outcomes in the 1970s. Numerous advances since the 1990s appear to have improved the safety and efficacy of this procedure. Arguably, the most important advance is the application of endoscopy which has become the predominant visualization tool and replaced the operating microscope at many centers. This transition has fueled collaboration between otolaryngologists and neurosurgeons in endoscopic skull base surgery, resulting in expanded knowledge of skull base and parasellar anatomy and refined surgical approaches, resection and reconstruction techniques (Fig. 1). Since 2013, most pituitary adenoma operations in the United States are performed endoscopically, and the endonasal route is increasingly the preferred route for many midline skull base tumors such as craniopharyngiomas, meningiomas and clival chordomas. Other important technological and technique innovations include (1) the "rescue flap" technique which spares the sphenopalatine vascular pedicle along the nasal septum as well as the septal olfactory strip to avoid postoperative epistaxis and anosmia; (2) Doppler probe localization of the parasellar carotid arteries for avoiding ICA injury, (3) the pseudocapsular dissection technique for maximizing chances of remission/resection as well as gland sparing and incising techniques for preserving pituitary gland function, and (4) graded repair technique for improved skull base closure, including the selective use of pedicle nasoseptal flaps to avoid CSF leaks and bacterial meningitis. From an organizational aspect, the concept of multidisciplinary pituitary centers of excellence has been promoted to better integrate collaboration among neurosurgeons, endocrinologists, otolaryngologists, neuro-ophthalmologists and radiation oncologists, to optimize overall management. Consensus guidelines have also been produced by endocrinology and neurosurgical experts in the field that have provided recommendations on optimal multidisciplinary management of specific adenoma subtypes such as acromegaly and Cushing's disease.

### Complication avoidance protocols in endoscopic pituitary adenoma surgery: a retrospective cohort study in 514 patients [^ab91cf32]. Pituitary (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Summary of experience

In 514 patients undergoing endoscopic pituitary adenoma removal over a 10-year period, major surgical complications occurred in 18 (3.5%) patients, including 4 (0.8%) that had permanent neurological sequelae. CSF leaks were the most common preventable complication occurring in 1.7% of the cohort, followed by meningitis in 0.8%. Worsening of gland function occurred in 4.5%. Notably there were no carotid artery injuries, permanent worsening of visual acuity or visual fields and no new permanent anosmia. The complication avoidance protocol followed in this cohort was associated with a median LOS of 2 days and 98% of patients being discharged to home. Overall complication rates decreased between the first and second half of the study period.

Complication avoidance protocols and their impact

Even prior to the advent of endoscopy over two decades ago, transsphenoidal pituitary adenoma surgery with the operating microscope was established as a relatively safe and effective procedure. Adoption of the fully endoscopic approach has promoted a " team surgery" concept of neurosurgeons and otolaryngologists working side-by-side for pituitary and parasellar pathology although at some centers, pituitary surgery is still performed only with neurosurgeons.

Over more than two decades, numerous groups have documented the incidence and root causes of complications in endoscopic pituitary surgery and stressed the importance of adherence to complication avoidance protocols to maximize patient safety and optimize outcomes. This collective experience by our group and others demonstrates that surgery is safe and effective for the great majority of patients, including patients undergoing reoperations, which represents 19% of our cohort. Table 8 highlights complication and resection rates in recent large endoscopic cohort studies since 2010 confirming the overall safety of this approach. However, it also reaffirms that careful attention to every stage of surgery including the sinonasal exposure, sellar opening and ICA localization, tumor resection, gland handling and sellar reconstruction is critical to achieving safe and successful outcomes.

It appears that 12 years after the publication of one of the first peer-reviewed papers on the use of endoscopic pituitary surgerythe advantages of the procedure are still not fully consolidated in accordance with the above algorithm for the evaluation of new surgical techniques. Clearly, the introduction of new surgical technology/procedures, such as endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery, is both a laudatory step towards innovation as well as a complex process requiring rigorous scrutiny with evidence-based methods such as discussed above or a similar acceptable variant thereof.

### Endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery: stone-in-the-pond effect [^36f75cdf]. Neurosurgery (2006). Low credibility.

THE TRANSSPHENOIDAL MIDLINE route represents the standard approach to the pituitary and sellar area and is used for more than 95% of surgical indications in this region. It is the least traumatic route to the sella turcica, it avoids brain retraction, and it provides excellent visualization of the pituitary gland and lesions related to that structure. The technique has essentially replaced craniotomy and has been used by every pituitary neurosurgeon, representing the "gold standard" of the transsphenoidal approach to the sellar region for more than 30 years. The introduction of endoscopic techniques has produced a "stone-in-the-pond" effect, influencing the relatively peaceful neurosurgical environment. The brilliant increased vision of the surgical target offered by the endoscope can allow more effective removal of the lesion, followed by superior clinical results and a reduction in the incidence of complications. Endoscopy contributes to better and more contemporary knowledge of the possibilities of the transsphenoidal approach, thus increasing the extended approaches, not only for the pituitary area. Whether or not the transsphenoidal approach should be performed with the use of the microscope or the endoscope is finally discussed.

### Internal carotid arterial shift after transsphenoidal surgery in pituitary adenomas with cavernous sinus invasion [^463cea74]. Pituitary (2013). Low credibility.

The intercarotid distance (ICD) between cavernous carotid arteries (CCAs) is an important factor for avoiding injury of the internal carotid artery during transsphenoidal surgery. The ICD between CCAs in pituitary adenoma patients is generally larger than in normal individuals. However, the movement of the CCA during transsphenoidal surgery is not known. The aim of this study is to measure the ICD between CCAs in pituitary adenoma patients before and after surgery. We reviewed 138 pituitary adenoma patients who were treated with resection via the transsphenoidal approach. The CCA diameter and the ICD between CCAs were measured from preoperative and postoperative MR images. The CCA diameter was similar at the preoperative and postoperative time points. On the other hand, the ICD between CCAs was shorter at postoperative time point (19.4 ± 4.5 mm) than at the preoperative time point (20.9 ± 4.9 mm) (P = 0.048). Above all, invasion type adenomas had more significant ICD change at the postoperative time point (23.8 ± 3.8 mm) than at the preoperative time point (21.6 ± 3.9 mm) (P = 0.008). Also in multivariate analysis, cavernous sinus invasion of adenoma was independently associated with ICD contraction > 2 mm (P = 0.027). It is important to know the change in ICD between CCAs after transsphenoidal surgery, particularly for pituitary adenomas with cavernous sinus invasion. The position of the CCA should be known before and during transsphenoidal surgery, as well before and during the second operation to avoid vascular injuries.

### Optimizing perioperative care in transsphenoidal pituitary surgery: considerations for enhanced recovery after surgery [^f5afd063]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify key recommendations for maximizing the efficiency and efficacy of perioperative care in transsphenoidal pituitary surgery.

Methods

The authors performed a comprehensive literature search of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery protocols implemented for patients undergoing transsphenoidal adenomectomy (TSA); individual recommendations were abstracted, and the evidence base thoroughly reviewed.

Results

The authors identified 19 individual recommendations pertinent to the care of patients undergoing TSA, which were subdivided into preoperative (n = 6), intraoperative (n = 6), and postoperative (n = 7) interventions. Key factors recommended for minimizing length of stay, preventing readmission, and improving patient outcomes included comprehensive patient education, multidisciplinary evaluation, avoidance of routine lumbar drain placement and nasal packing, and rigorous postoperative monitoring of pituitary function and salt-water imbalances. The overall level of evidence for 7/19 (37%) implemented recommendations was found to be low, suggesting a need for continued research in this patient population.

Conclusion

Several key interventions should be considered in the development of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery protocols for TSA, which may aid in further decreasing length of stay and promoting positive patient outcomes.

### Safety and efficacy of endoscopic vs. microscopic approaches in pituitary adenoma surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^62b59b9e]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pituitary adenoma (PA) is an endocrine tumor that arises in the anterior or posterior pituitary gland, originating from residual craniopharyngioma epithelium. Epidemiological data suggest it is the third most prevalent brain tumor, following glioma and meningioma and accounts for 16.7% of intracranial tumors. PA interferes with the secretion of growth hormone and thyrotropin, and its optic nerve compression may result in vision impairment. Surgical tissue damage may elicit stress responses, hindering recovery. PA is categorized based on hormonal activity into non-secreting, prolactin-secreting (PRL), and producing adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), growth hormone (GH), or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Since medication often leads to undesirable side effects, transsphenoidal surgery (TSS) remains a well-established treatment option, with continuous advancements over the past decade. Nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFPAs) are the most prevalent type, following prolactinomas. NFPAs constitute one-third of all PAs and are primarily characterized by tumor mass effects, lacking hormonal hypersecretion.

Surgery serves as the principal treatment for pituitary adenomas, which can be executed via craniotomy or transsphenoidal approach. A craniotomy is indicated for larger tumors or those that extend superiorly and laterally beyond the sella. The TSS is preferable for tumors localized to the sella or those extending into the sphenoid sinus, especially in patients with well-pneumatized sphenoid sinuses. The TSS for sellar tumor resection was initially introduced by Schoffler in 1907 and subsequently refined by Cushing. In the 1960 s, Jules Hardy's implementation of the operating microscope markedly improved surgical precision. Since the early twenty-first century, advancements in endoscopic techniques have enhanced visualization and outcomes, resulting in widespread adoption. Despite advancements in pituitary adenoma surgery, the optimal approach between the endoscopic transsphenoidal approach (ETSA) and the microscopic transsphenoidal approach (MTSA) remains unclear. ETSA enhances visualization; however, it introduces a learning curve and potential risks, including prolonged operative time and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks. Conversely, MTSA may result in extended hospitalizations and increased nasal disruption. The lack of standardized protocols and objective comparative research underscores the necessity for high-quality studies to identify the most effective surgical technique for managing PAs.

### Transsphenoidal and transcranial surgery for pituitary adenomas [^5b5673d6]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

This paper reviews the progress made over the first century of pituitary surgery. The goals of surgery for pituitary tumors are to eliminate tumor mass effect and perform as complete a removal as possible, retain pituitary function, and normalize any hormonal hypersecretion. Since the initial transsphenoidal approach performed in Austria by Schloffer, the transsphenoidal approach has become the preferred surgical approach to most pituitary tumors. The history and development of the transsphenoidal approach to the sella is discussed, as are the contemporary techniques of microscopic and endoscopic pituitary surgery. The continued evolution of the variations and extension of the transsphenoidal approach to other lesions are reviewed. The indications and use of a transcranial approach to remove pituitary tumors are discussed. More recently, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has become an important adjuvant management technique in the management of difficult pituitary adenomas, especially with cavernous sinus invasion.

### Pituitary society expert Delphi consensus: operative workflow in endoscopic transsphenoidal pituitary adenoma resection [^83a16011]. Pituitary (2021). High credibility.

Endoscopic transsphenoidal pituitary adenoma resection — A mixed-methods Pituitary Society consensus using iterative Delphi surveys repeated until data saturation and > 90% consensus was reached generated a workflow for operative practice. There was a 100% response rate and no attrition across both Delphi rounds, and Eighteen international expert panel members participated. An extensive workflow of 4 phases (nasal, sphenoidal, sellar and closure) and 40 steps, with associated technical errors and adverse events, were agreed upon by 100% of panel members across rounds. The agreed "core" steps will serve as a foundation for education, training, assessment and technological development, while the "optional" steps highlight areas of heterogeneity of practice that will benefit from further research.

### Direct suture technique of normal gland edge on the incised dura margin to repair the intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage from the arachnoid recess during transsphenoidal pituitary tumor surgery [^ffb4de66]. Neurosurgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

During transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenomas with large suprasellar extension, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage commonly develops from a defect at the arachnoid recess between the resected dura margin and the anterior edge of a normal pituitary gland (type 1 CSF leakage).

Objective

To evaluate the usefulness of a direct suture technique of the normal gland edge on the incised dural margin to repair intraoperative CSF leakage from the arachnoid recess.

Methods

Between November 2005 and December 2012, 861 patients with pituitary adenomas were operated on with transsphenoidal surgery, and intraoperative CSF leakage was encountered in 432 patients. Type 1 CSF leakage developed in a total of 122 patients, and their defects were repaired with the direct suture technique in 51 patients, whereas a fleece-coated fibrin glue patch alone was applied onto the defect in the other 71 patients. This direct suture technique required an additional 5 to 20 minutes in most cases.

Results

We experienced no case of postoperative CSF rhinorrhea in the 51 patients whose defects were repaired by the direct suture technique and only 1 case of CSF rhinorrhea in 71 patients whose defects were repaired with a fleece-coated fibrin glue patch alone. There was no statistical difference in the outcome between 2 groups. Postoperative lumbar CSF drainage was not performed in any case.

Conclusion

Our 2 different repair techniques for arachnoid recess tears are very reliable methods for managing this type of CSF leakage. The direct suture technique may be more appropriate for type 1 CSF leakage with a wider gap and more prominent CSF leakage.

### Pituitary society Delphi survey: an international perspective on endocrine management of patients undergoing transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenomas [^d1f004d2]. Pituitary (2022). High credibility.

Pituitary Society Delphi Survey — perioperative endocrine management in transsphenoidal surgery highlights that clinical experience suggests that preoperative medical therapy may be helpful in patients with Cushing's disease and very high cortisol levels who present with acute psychiatric illness or sepsis, and that the definition of remission in all hyperfunctioning pituitary tumors remains controversial, including the role of immediate postoperative laboratory testing. Several items pertaining to the postoperative assessment of remission in patients with functioning tumors did not achieve consensus, including early prolactin or growth hormone (GH) measurements in patients with prolactinoma or acromegaly, post-glucose GH testing in acromegaly, and the measurements of plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone, 24-h urinary free cortisol, and late-night salivary cortisol in Cushing's disease; some data support the predictive value of these tests in assessing endocrine remission. In conclusion, substantial consensus on endocrine aspects of the perioperative evaluation and management of adults undergoing transsphenoidal surgery was reached, using a Delphi process; however, consensus was not reached on a minority of items where further research is needed to inform expert opinion, pituitary care and further consensus guidelines.

### Direct transnasal approach for pituitary surgery [^ef0d09bf]. Neurosurgical Review (2004). Low credibility.

One hundred four patients with pituitary tumours were treated using the direct transnasal approach. The data of these patients were analysed prospectively with regard to duration of surgery and occurrence of complications and compared with retrospective data from 52 patients in whom the traditional sublabial trans-sphenoidal approach was performed. Using the direct transnasal approach, mean operative time was significantly lower than with the sublabial technique. In addition, even though major complications were observed in neither treatment group, minor complications were significantly less frequent after the direct transnasal approach. Due to minimised dissection of normal tissue, this approach is less time-consuming and less traumatic, and the rate of minor complications is significantly lower than with the sublabial procedure.

### Surgical outcomes of the endoscopic transsphenoidal route to pituitary tumours in paediatric patients > 10 years of age: 5 years of experience at a single institute [^4495f5fa]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery is a novel and minimally invasive approach for pituitary adenomas.
This technique may be more challenging in paediatric patients due to incomplete development of the nasal and sphenoid sinuses.

What this study adds?

The surgical outcomes of endoscopic transsphenoidal resection for pituitary adenomas in older paediatric patients were excellent and comparable to those of adults.
The postsurgical complications of the endoscopic transsphenoidal approach exhibited a low incidence and were curable.
Endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery can be performed safely in paediatric patients older than 10 years of age with low morbidity and mortality.

### Advances in surgical approaches for refractory pituitary adenomas [^b4c0c0a2]. Pituitary (2023). Medium credibility.

Refractory pituitary adenomas are difficult to control tumors that progress through optimal surgical, medical, and radiation management. Repeat surgery is a valuable tool to reduce tumor volume for more effective radiation and/or medical therapy, and to decompress critical neurovascular structures. Advances in surgical techniques and technologies, including minimally invasive cranial approaches, intraoperative MRI suites, and cranial nerve monitoring, have improved surgical outcomes and expanded indications. Today, repeat transsphenoidal surgery has similar complications rates to upfront surgery in historical cohorts. The decision to operate on refractory adenomas should be made with multidisciplinary teams, balancing the benefit of tumor reduction with the potential for complications, including cranial nerve injury, carotid injury, and cerebrospinal fluid leak.

### Endonasal endoscopic transsphenoidal approach to lesions of the sellar region in pediatric patients [^a9f65813]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Transient DI following surgery occurred in 2 (18.2%) patients (Table 3), and no patient had permanent DI. These results are consistent with reported transient DI rates ranging from 0.4% to 48.8%, and less than reported permanent DI rates ranging from 2.3% to 8.1%. DI after surgery of the sellar region is neurogenic from injury to the magnocellular neurons in the hypothalamus where arginine vasopressin (AVP) is produced and transported to posterior pituitary gland via the hypothalamo-hypophyseal tract. Factors including lesion size, adherence to surrounding structures, histopathology; and surgical approach can result in DI. Care should be taken in surgery to preserve neurovascular structures and to minimize injury to critical structures including the hypothalamus, the infundibulum, and the neurohypophysis during surgical approach. In the current study, 1 patient with symptomatic polydipsia and polyuria preoperatively had no change of the symptoms postoperatively. It is possible that the tumor caused permanent damage to the hypothalamic–posterior pituitary axis.

Hypopituitarism occurred in 3 (27.3%) patients (Table 3), comparable to reported rates ranging from 1.4% to 19.8%, and less than rates as high as 67% following transsphenoidal approach. Hypopituitarism may be associated with dysfunction of anterior pituitary postoperatively; and may require hormone replacement therapy. Of 3 patients with hypopituitarism, 2 had hypothyroidism treated daily with thyroxine; and 1 hypocortisolism which was treated with hydrocortisone.

### Treatment of Cushing's syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^2d10eb12]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Repeat transsphenoidal surgery (TSS) for persistent or recurrent hypercortisolism — We suggest repeat transsphenoidal surgery, particularly in patients with evidence of incomplete resection, or a pituitary lesion on imaging. In 12 of 17 patients with persistent hypercortisolism after TSS, early repeat transsphenoidal surgery induced hypocortisolism, and for recurrence, repeat surgery led to hypocortisolism in 22 of 31 patients with previous surgical remission; evidence of previous incomplete resection, the presence of a pituitary lesion on imaging, and intraoperative tumor detection predicted remission. Repeat surgery carries an increased risk of hypopituitarism compared to initial surgery, and although remission is less likely than after the first surgery, it can be achieved rapidly compared to some other second-line treatments.

### Long term outcome following repeat transsphenoidal surgery for recurrent endocrine-inactive pituitary adenomas [^382483fe]. Pituitary (2010). Low credibility.

While these data and that reported by others demonstrate repeat transsphenoidal surgery can generally be performed with good results and a low amount of major morbidity, the single mortality in this series highlights the potential serious risk of repeat surgery, as typical landmarks and tissue planes helpful in the initial surgery, are not present at repeat surgery, increasing the risk of intrasellar and intracranial bleeding and the attendant complications resulting from these problems. Our complication rates for repeat surgery are slightly higher than those observed for very experienced transsphenoidal surgeons performing initial surgery. The surgeon and patient must be aware of these risks when weighing the benefits and risks of a repeat entry into the sella.

Rational therapy for recurrent EIA's involves assessment and application of the cost-risk–benefit balance between treatment, continued observation, and radiation therapy. At time of recurrence, the histologic diagnosis of these tumors has been established, and the primary management goal of these tumors is the prevention of endocrine and visual morbidity related to tumor growth. Given the lack of hormonal hypersecretion for these tumors, the cost-risk–benefit balance largely centers around the issue of tumor control, and necessity of treatment for obtaining tumor control. While our data suggest that repeat surgery is a reasonable and safe option for achieving tumor control, it is certainly not the least invasive or least costly method for achieving this goal. While it is possible that recurrence of tumor implies a persistently growing tumor phenotype, more data regarding the natural history of untreated recurrent EIA's are needed to determine what fraction, if any, of these tumors plateau in growth, and what fraction continue to regrow. A better understanding of the natural history of recurrent EIA's is necessary to determine the relative feasibility of observation of recurrent EIA's, and to determine the indications for repeat transsphenoidal surgery.

In short, we provide long term follow-up data demonstrating that repeat transsphenoidal surgery is a reasonable and effective therapy for large recurrences of endocrine inactive pituitary macroadenomas, which can be performed with good visual and endocrine outcomes, and a low rate of 3rd recurrence, even when followed out over a decade.

Pituitary Society consensus — methods overview and literature review: The authors sought to generate a surgical workflow for endoscopic TSA resection of pituitary adenomas through an iterative, mixed‑methods consensus process that captured the range of ways the operation is performed and did not decide on the optimal set of phases, steps or instruments; the operation was defined as beginning at entry of the endoscope endonasally with the use of surgical instruments. The process began with a brief literature review of neurosurgical textbooks and articles (PubMed or EMBASE) using the keywords "endoscopic transsphenoidal", "pituitary adenoma" and "operative technique", from which an initial operative workflow was generated.

### Patient information: pituitary adenomas… [^05730664]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Pituitary adenomas with increased production of growth hormone can cause enlargement of hand, foot, and facial features; headache; osteoarthritis; diabetes; sleep apnea; and high blood pressure. Pituitary adenomas that secrete corticotropin can cause obesity, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, anxiety, depression, and sleep problems. Pituitary adenomas with excess secretion of thyrotropin can result in hyperthyroidism, which may cause sweating, rapid or irregular heartbeat, irritability, and unexpected weight loss. Nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas do not produce hormones but can cause headaches or partial loss of vision by compressing the optic nerves and can interfere with normal pituitary function. Patients with a known or suspected pituitary tumor should undergo high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging of the brain to assess the adenoma size and location.

Blood tests for specific hormone levels should be performed to determine whether it is a functioning or nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma. First-line treatment for most pituitary adenomas is surgery, which is most commonly performed using a minimally invasive technique called transsphenoidal pituitary surgery. During this procedure, instruments are passed through the nasal passages to remove the tumor. Much less commonly, pituitary adenomas that are very large may be treated with more invasive surgery, which involves the temporary removal of bone from the skull to access the tumor. After surgery, approximately 5% to 15% of patients develop recurrent pituitary adenomas. Patients who have persistent or recurrent pituitary adenoma after surgery may be treated with medications or radiation therapy. First-line therapy for a prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma is medication.

The 2 drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating these types of pituitary adenomas are bromocriptine and cabergoline. Nonfunctioning microadenomas that are not causing any symptoms may not need to be treated but should be monitored with MRI scans at regular intervals.

### Childhood craniopharyngioma-NCI… [^8a1d7373]. NCI (2008). Low credibility.

Craniopharyngiomas are usually part solid mass and part fluid-filled cyst. They are not cancer and do not spread to other parts of the brain or other parts of the body. However, they can grow and press on nearby parts of the brain, such as the pituitary gland. Or they may press on other areas, such as:

- the optic chiasm
- the optic nerves
- the fluid-filled spaces in the brain Craniopharyngiomas may affect many brain functions, including hormone production, growth, and vision. Treatments help stop the tumor from pushing on other areas of the brain. Blood hormone studies Blood hormone studies use a blood sample to measure the amounts of certain hormones released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. If the amount of a hormone is higher or lower than normal, it can be a sign of disease in the organ or tissue that makes it. For craniopharyngioma, the blood may be checked for unusual levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone or adrenocorticotropic hormone.

These hormones are made by the pituitary gland. Biopsy If the CT scan or MRI show there may be a brain tumor, your child will have a biopsy to remove a sample of the tumor. Types of biopsy that may be used to take the sample of tissue include: Surgery for cysts If your child's tumor is mostly a fluid-filled cyst, they may have surgery to drain it. Draining it lowers the pressure in the brain and relieves symptoms. A surgery called a partial resection can be used to remove fluid from cystic craniopharyngiomas. Or a thin tube called a catheter can be inserted into the cyst, and a small container placed under the skin. The fluid drains into the container and is later removed. Serious physical problems may occur if the pituitary gland, hypothalamus, optic nerves, or carotid artery are affected during surgery or radiation therapy.

These problems include:

- obesity
- metabolic syndrome, including fatty liver disease not caused by drinking alcohol
- vision problems, including blindness
- blood vessel problems or stroke
- loss of the ability to make certain hormones Some late effects may be treated or controlled. Your child may need life-long hormone replacement therapy with several medicines. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects treatment can have on your child. Learn more about Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer.

### Transsphenoidal cyst cisternostomy with a keyhole dural opening for sellar arachnoid cysts: technical note [^4b258d96]. Neurosurgical Review (2014). Low credibility.

A less invasive transsphenoidal approach with a keyhole dural opening for intrasellar arachnoid cysts is described. This approach was used to address seven sellar cystic lesions with suprasellar extension; they were six intrasellar arachnoid cysts (IACs) and one Rathke's cleft cyst (RCC). In all cases, preoperative MRI revealed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images. On preoperative contrast-enhanced MRI, five of the six IACs manifested posterior displacement of the flattened pituitary gland toward the dorsum sellae; one of the six IACs and the RCC exhibited a flattened pituitary gland on the anterior surface of the cyst. Wide cyst cisternostomy through a keyhole dural opening was carried out safely using a microscope with the support of a thin angled endoscope (30° and/or 70°, diameter 2.7 mm). As we aimed to avoid iatrogenic injury of the pituitary function, we found it difficult to obtain a sufficiently wide and precise opening of the cyst wall when the pituitary gland was located on the anterior surface of the cyst wall. Our approach facilitates safe cyst cisternostomy as wide as that obtainable by transcranial manipulation. In addition, CSF leakage is prevented by dural plasty using the fascia lata and stitching with 6–0 monofilament sutures. This technique can be adapted to address various sellar cystic lesions. However, as the posterior or anterior displacement of the normal pituitary gland in the presence of IACs or RCCs, respectively, affects the width of the cyst opening, our technique is more suitable for IACs than RCCs.

### The postoperative cortisol stress response following transsphenoidal pituitary surgery: a potential screening method for assessing preserved pituitary function [^d2947f02]. Pituitary (2013). Low credibility.

The ability to reliably identify patients with new hypocortisolemia acutely following pituitary surgery is critical. We aimed to quantify the postoperative cortisol stress response following selective transsphenoidal adenomectomy, as a marker for postoperative preservation of functional pituitary gland. Records of 208 patients undergoing transsphenoidal operations for pituitary lesions were reviewed. Patients with Cushing's Disease, preoperative adrenal insufficiency, and those receiving intraoperative steroids were excluded. To quantify the postoperative stress response, the ∆ cortisol index was defined as the postoperative day (POD) 1 morning cortisol minus the preoperative morning cortisol level. The incidence of new hypocortisolemia requiring glucocorticoid replacement upon hospital discharge was also recorded. Fifty-two patients met inclusion criteria. The mean preoperative, POD1, and POD2 cortisol levels were 16.5, 29.2, and 21.8 μg/dL, respectively. Morning fasting cortisol levels on POD1 ranged from 4.2 to 73.0 μg/dL. The ∆ cortisol index ranged from -19.0 to +56.2 (mean +12.7 μg/dL). Five patients (9.6%) developed new hypocortisolemia on POD 1–3 requiring glucocorticoid replacement; only one required long-term replacement. The mean ∆ cortisol in patients requiring postoperative glucocorticoids was -2.8 μg/dL, compared with +14.4 μg/dL in patients without evidence of adrenal insufficiency (p = 0.005). Of the 32 patients (61.5%) with a ∆cortisol > 25 μg/dL, none developed postoperative adrenal insufficiency. The postoperative cortisol stress response, as quantified by the ∆ cortisol index, holds potential as a novel and complimentary screening method to predict preservation of normal pituitary function and acute development of new ACTH deficiency following transsphenoidal pituitary surgery.

### Tricks and traps of ICG endoscopy for effectively applying endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery to pituitary adenoma [^ef774f49]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

Differentiating tumor from normal pituitary gland is very important for achieving complete resection without complications in endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery (ETSS) for pituitary adenoma. To facilitate such surgery, we investigated the utility of indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence endoscopy as a tool in ETSS. Twenty-four patients with pituitary adenoma were enrolled in the study and underwent ETSS using ICG endoscopy. After administering 12.5 mg of ICG twice an operation with an interval > 30 min, times from ICG administration to appearance of fluorescence on vital structures besides the tumor were measured. ICG endoscopy identified vital structures by the phasic appearance of fluorescent signals emitted at specific consecutive elapsed times. Elapsed times for internal carotid arteries did not differ according to tumor size. Conversely, as tumor size increased, elapsed times for normal pituitary gland were prolonged but those for the tumor were reduced. ICG endoscopy revealed a clear boundary between tumors and normal pituitary gland and enabled confirmation of no more tumor. ICG endoscopy could provide a useful tool for differentiating tumor from normal pituitary gland by evaluating elapsed times to fluorescence in each structure. This method enabled identification of the boundary between tumor and normal pituitary gland under conditions of a low-fluorescence background, resulting in complete tumor resection with ETSS. ICG endoscopy will contribute to improve the resection rate while preserving endocrinological functions in ETSS for pituitary adenoma.

### Pituitary adenoma consistency affects postoperative hormone function: a retrospective study [^a2398fe8]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Pituitary adenomas (PAs) are common intracranial neoplasms, accounting for 15% of brain tumors. In most cases, they are clinically silent, with epidemiology studies reporting a 16% to 20% prevalence of pituitary incidentalomas in the healthy population. Their clinical significance mainly lies in possible autonomous hormone secretion and mass-related complications typically associated with large adenomas, such as headache, visual defects, and hypopituitarism.

Surgical resection is the current treatment of choice for large symptomatic tumors as well as for hormone-secreting Pas, with the exception of prolactinomas. The primary aims of pituitary surgery are to reduce mass-related effects and normalize hormone secretion. Given the potential damage to the anatomical components of the sella turcica (such as the healthy pituitary gland, blood vessels, the visual pathways and the hypothalamus), pituitary surgery bears the risk of potentially serious complications, including cranial nerve defects, iatrogenic hypopituitarism, diabetes insipidus and, more rarely, cerebrospinal fluid leak, bleeding, and infections. However, the advent of increasingly precise and more standardized neurosurgical techniques and improved equipment have drastically reduced the prevalence of surgery-related complications.

The technique of endoscopic transnasal, nontransseptal, transsphenoidal pituitary surgery is gaining increasing popularity. Many pituitary surgical teams consider it the procedure of choice. It provides a rapid and safe approach to the sella turcica. Within the sella turcica, the endoscopes give the surgeon the ability to inspect around the corner and to remove residual tumor. The procedure avoids the complications related to the sublabial transeptal approach. Hospital stay is shorter.

### Use of morning serum cortisol level after transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma to predict the need for long-term glucocorticoid supplementation [^ac0196b8]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2009). Low credibility.

Object

Accurate assessment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is critical for appropriate management of the disease in patients with pituitary adenoma after transsphenoidal resection. The authors examine the role of the morning total serum cortisol level in the early postoperative period as a predictor of long-term HPA function.

Methods

Morning total serum cortisol was measured in 83 patients on postoperative Day 1 (or Day 2 if the patient received glucocorticoids during surgery) after transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenoma. These results were compared with those of definitive assays of HPA function performed at 1–3 months postoperatively, including cortrosyn/synacthen stimulation test (CST), insulin tolerance test (ITT), and metyrapone test (MTT). The ability of the early-postoperative morning cortisol level to predict HPA function was determined using standard confusion matrix calculations and receiver-operator control curve analysis.

Results

The authors found that an early postoperative morning total cortisol level ≥ 15 microg/dl is a sensitive and accurate predictor of normal HPA function in the postoperative period (sensitivity 80.5%, specificity 66.7%, positive predictive value 96.9%).

Conclusions

A morning total cortisol level ≥ 15 microg/dl in the early postoperative period after transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenomas is a good predictor of normal HPA function. This test has good sensitivity and accuracy and correlates well with the results of additional, definitive assays of HPA function (CST, ITT, and MTT) performed at 1–3 months postoperatively. Accordingly, it is the authors' practice to avoid exogenous perioperative glucocorticoid supplementation in patients with normal preoperative HPA function and postoperative morning total cortisol levels ≥ 15 microg/dl 1–2 days after transsphenoidal pituitary adenomectomy.

### Withholding perioperative steroids in patients undergoing transsphenoidal resection for pituitary disease: randomized prospective clinical trial to assess safety [^f8e2ab60]. Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Perioperative steroid protocols for patients undergoing transsphenoidal surgery (TSS) for pituitary pathology vary by institution.

Objective

To assess the safety of withholding glucocorticoids in patients undergoing TSS.

Methods

Patients with an intact hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis undergoing TSS for a pituitary tumor at the same academic institution between 2012 and 2015 were randomized to either receive 100 mg of intravenous hydrocortisone followed by 0.5 mg of intravenous dexamethasone every 6 h for 4 doses (STER, n = 23) or to undergo surgery without steroids (NOSTER, n = 20). Postoperative cortisol levels were then used to determine the need for glucocorticoids after surgery. Data regarding postoperative cortisol levels, hospital stay length, and complications were collected.

Results

Mean postoperative 8 am cortisol levels were higher in the NOSTER group compared to the STER group (745 ± 359 nmol/L and 386 ± 193 nmol/L, respectively, P = 0.001) and more patients were discharged on glucocorticoids in the STER group (42% vs 12%, P = 0.07). There was no difference in the incidence of postoperative complications, including hyperglycemia, diabetes insipidus, or permanent adrenal insufficiency. Permanent adrenal insufficiency occurred in 8% of patients.

Conclusion

Perioperative steroids can be safely withheld in patients with an intact HPA axis undergoing TSS. Although administration of perioperative glucocorticoids does not appear to increase the risk of complications, it may interfere with assessment of the HPA axis after surgery.

### Pituitary society Delphi survey: an international perspective on endocrine management of patients undergoing transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenomas [^4ad95f35]. Pituitary (2022). High credibility.

Pituitary Society Delphi Survey — areas without consensus include dilutional prolactin testing in macroadenomas and risks from the "hook effect". The panel notes that consensus was not achieved on several items, and notably, panelists did not broadly agree on the need to measure serum prolactin in dilution in patients with macroadenomas. Prolactin immunoassays can be susceptible to the "hook effect" artifact, which may lead to substantial underreporting of prolactin measurements in sera containing very high prolactin concentrations, and this artifact can lead to misclassification of a prolactin-secreting adenoma as a non-functioning lesion. Some panelists would recommend measuring prolactin in dilution only in sera from patients with giant adenomas, whereas others rely on laboratory checks for nonlinearity; newer platforms likely detect the hook effect but older assays may not, creating potential for misdiagnosis.

### Classification of and risk factors for sodium imbalance developing after transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary neuroendocrine tumors [^acda6b9f]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Among surgical factors triggering postoperative sodium imbalance development, we confirmed the predictive value of CSF rhinorrhea. Intraoperative CSF leakage has been reported to be associated with a 2.5 times greater risk of delayed hyponatremia, which in turn is associated with longer operation times. Longer operation times may entail an increased chance of more surgical manipulation of the pituitary stalk and gland during surgical exploration, which can induce altered hormonal homeostasis in the postoperative period. Although the duration of surgery was not included in this study, it and CSF leakage both essentially reflect the damage to hypothalamic and pituitary function caused by surgical procedures.

Based on the results of this study, we believe that there should be different treatment options for different types of sodium imbalance. Fluid restriction is the most common, well researched, and effective preventive measure and treatment for postoperative hyponatremia but there are concerns about its safety. In our experience, oral or intravenous sodium supplementation cannot restore serum sodium levels in patients with mild hyponatremia (i.e.g.roup 1), and fluid restriction is the preferred treatment option, but daily intravenous sodium supplementation is still required to prevent or treat associated symptoms. The monitoring of the sodium serum level is more important for patients with group 2 disorders; we do not recommend early fluid restriction for these patients, but oral sodium supplementation is relatively safe. For patients who develop hypernatremia in the early postoperative period, we monitor the serum sodium level more intensively and adjust the solvent in a timely manner according to the rate of decline/change. For patients with persistent high fever on antipyretics, additional daily sodium supplementation is required.

This study has several limitations. First, because it was retrospective, the results may be affected by unavoidable biases. Second, as routine lumbar puncture to obtain CSF samples is unethical, we did not have a complete CSF dataset for the control group and could not perform the corresponding regression analysis. Comprehensive analysis of the effects of CSF rhinorrhea and other CSF-related indicators on postoperative sodium imbalance development is thus needed. Third, we did not classify functioning pituitary neuroendocrine tumors further, and patients with Cushing disease were not excluded from the analysis. Rapid changes in glucocorticoid levels in ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas can result in electrolyte imbalance, and the effects of these tumors on hyponatremia development may have affect the study results.

Limitations

We performed a retrospective analysis on patients who underwent transsphenoidal/transnasal surgery. Due to our patient inclusion based on the surgical code, patients operated via craniotomy may not have been included. Further, a complete preoperative laboratory workup, including pituitary hormones and sensitive infection markers (e.g. PCT) was unavailable for some patients. Additionally, detailed medication at follow-up was inconsistently reported, potentially misrepresenting the rate of postoperative hormone replacement.

### Normal pituitary hypertrophy as a frequent cause of pituitary incidentaloma: a follow-up study [^6f5061c0]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

Enlargement of the pituitary gland is a frequent cause of incidentaloma and of referrals to endocrinologists for hormonal evaluation and therapeutic advice. In neuroradiological series, 25–50% of healthy women who are 18–35 yr old have a convex superior pituitary contour, but pituitary height exceeds 9 mm in less than 0.5% of cases. This study was performed to provide thorough clinical and hormonal data and long-term endocrinological and imaging follow-up data on subjects with incidentally discovered pituitary hypertrophy (height > 9 mm). Seven eugonadal nulliparous women, 15–27 yr old, referred between 1989 and 1998 with incidentally diagnosed pituitary gland enlargement (height > 9 mm) and a suspected pituitary tumor, were studied. At presentation and at yearly intervals, PRL plasma levels and corticotropic, somatotropic, and thyrotropic pituitary function were measured; and pituitary dimensions and signal on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), before and after iv gadolinium-diethylene-triamine-pentaacetic acid injection, were assessed. PRL plasma levels were normal; and corticotropic, somatotropic, and thyrotropic pituitary function was considered normal in all cases. In all the women, the upper boundary of the pituitary was convex, on MRI, and touched the optic chiasm in four cases. The width and anteroposterior diameter of the gland were normal. The pituitary itself seemed normal, with a homogeneous signal, on plain and dynamic studies with iv contrast injection. Despite normal initial hormone values, two women underwent surgery, by the transsphenoidal approach, in another center. During surgery, the pituitary seemed normal in both cases, with no evidence of tumoral or inflammatory processes. Biopsy specimens showed the morphologic characteristics of a normal, nonhyperplastic pituitary gland. All seven women were seen at yearly intervals for 2–8 yr (median, 4 yr). Clinical and hormonal status remained stable, as did the structure and size of pituitary, on serial MRI. No tumor formation occurred, supporting the diagnosis of physiologic hypertrophy of the pituitary gland. In conclusion, these observations suggest that careful examination of MRI results may help to distinguish physiologic pituitary hypertrophy from pituitary tumors and infiltrating lesions. The former diagnosis is confirmed by normal baseline pituitary function in extensive hormonal tests. Correct identification of such patients is important to avoid unnecessary pituitary surgery and costly MRI surveillance.

### Results of a prospective multicenter controlled study comparing surgical outcomes of microscopic versus fully endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery for nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas: the transsphenoidal extent of resection (TRANSSPHER) study [^cb0b7f0d]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Many surgeons have adopted fully endoscopic over microscopic transsphenoidal surgery for nonfunctioning pituitary tumors, although no high-quality evidence demonstrates superior patient outcomes with endoscopic surgery. The goal of this analysis was to compare these techniques in a prospective multicenter controlled study.

Methods

Extent of tumor resection was compared after endoscopic or microscopic transsphenoidal surgery in adults with nonfunctioning adenomas. The primary end point was gross-total tumor resection determined by postoperative MRI. Secondary end points included volumetric extent of tumor resection, pituitary hormone outcomes, and standard quality measures.

Results

Seven pituitary centers and 15 surgeons participated in the study. Of the 530 patients screened, 260 were enrolled (82 who underwent microscopic procedures, 177 who underwent endoscopic procedures, and 1 who cancelled surgery) between February 2015 and June 2017. Surgeons who used the microscopic technique were more experienced than the surgeons who used the endoscopic technique in terms of years in practice and number of transsphenoidal surgeries performed (p < 0.001). Gross-total resection was achieved in 80.0% (60/75) of microscopic surgery patients and 83.7% (139/166) of endoscopic surgery patients (p = 0.47, OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.4–1.6). Volumetric extent of resection, length of stay, surgery-related deaths, and unplanned readmission rates were similar between groups (p > 0.2). New hormone deficiency was present at 6 months in 28.4% (19/67) of the microscopic surgery patients and 9.7% (14/145) of the endoscopic surgery patients (p < 0.001, OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.7–7.7). Microscopic surgery cases were significantly shorter in duration than endoscopic surgery cases (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Experienced surgeons who performed microscopic surgery and less experienced surgeons who performed endoscopic surgery achieved similar extents of tumor resection and quality outcomes in patients with nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas. The endoscopic technique may be associated with lower rates of postoperative pituitary gland dysfunction. This study generally supports the transition to endoscopic pituitary surgery when the procedure is performed by proficient surgeons, although both techniques yield overall acceptable surgical outcomes.■ CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE Type of question: therapeutic; study design: prospective cohort trial; evidence: class III.

### Transsphenoidal surgery in patients with acromegaly: operative strategies for overcoming technically challenging anatomical variations [^083ad5f0]. Neurosurgical Focus (2010). Low credibility.

Object

In addition to difficulties with anesthetic and medical management, transsphenoidal operations in patients with longstanding acromegaly are associated with inherent intraoperative challenges because of anatomical variations that occur frequently in these patients. The object of this study was to review the overall safety profile and anatomical/technical challenges associated with transsphenoidal surgery in patients with acromegaly.

Methods

The authors performed a retrospective analysis of 169 patients who underwent endoscopic transsphenoidal operations for growth hormone-secreting adenomas to assess the incidence of surgical complications. A review of frequently occurring anatomical challenges and operative strategies employed during each phase of the operation to address these particular issues was performed.

Results

Of 169 cases reviewed, there was no perioperative mortality. Internal carotid artery injury occurred in 1 patient (0.6%) with complex sinus anatomy, who remained neurologically intact following endovascular unilateral carotid artery occlusion. Other complications included: significant postoperative epistaxis (5 patients [3%]), transient diabetes insipidus (5 patients [3%]), delayed symptomatic hyponatremia (4 patients [2%]), CSF leak (2 patients [1%]), and pancreatitis (1 patient [0.6%]). Preoperative considerations in patients with acromegaly should include a cardiopulmonary evaluation and planning regarding intubation and other aspects of the anesthetic technique. During the nasal phase of the transsphenoidal operation, primary challenges include maintaining adequate visualization and hemostasis, which is frequently compromised by redundant, edematous nasal mucosa and bony hypertrophy of the septum and the nasal turbinates. During the sphenoid phase, adequate bony removal, optimization of working space, and correlation of imaging studies to intraoperative anatomy are major priorities. The sellar phase is frequently challenged by increased sellar floor thickness, distinct patterns of tumor extension and bony invasion, and anatomical variations in the caliber and course of the internal carotid artery. Specific operative techniques for addressing each of these intraoperative challenges are discussed.

Conclusions

Transsphenoidal surgery in patients with longstanding acromegaly frequently poses greater challenges than operations for other types of sellar lesions, yet these challenges may be safely and effectively overcome with the anticipation of specific issues and implementation of various intraoperative techniques.
