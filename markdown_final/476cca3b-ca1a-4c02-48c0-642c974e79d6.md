## Question

What lab to order to monitor titration of diuretics and how often?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which laboratory tests to order to monitor diuretic titration and how often to check them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core safety parameters that change with diuretics. Then, I should verify the highest-credibility guideline recommendations for timing. Next, I will consider special populations and inpatient versus outpatient contexts. After that, I should review emerging biomarkers like spot urine sodium and natriuretic peptides and clarify their evidentiary status. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified monitoring plan and note what to do if labs are abnormal, making sure I anchor each step to guidelines and pivotal studies.

> Let me first confirm the essential labs. Diuretics primarily affect electrolytes and kidney function, so the basic metabolic panel (BMP) is the foundational test to monitor sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, and creatinine/eGFR; this is consistently recommended across ACC/AHA and KDIGO documents and is the most efficient single order for safety surveillance during titration [^116xsjtZ] [^113Mbx4o].

> Wait, let me verify the timing after initiation or dose change. Multiple high-credibility sources converge on rechecking a BMP within 2 to 4 weeks after starting or increasing a diuretic, with some diabetes-focused guidance suggesting 7 to 14 days in higher-risk patients; I initially thought 7–14 days applied broadly, but hold on, I should correct that: the 7–14 day interval is emphasized in diabetes standards for antihypertensives including diuretics, whereas general ACC/AHA hypertension guidance supports 2–4 weeks for most adults, so I should frame 7–14 days as a more conservative interval for high-risk patients such as those with CKD, diabetes, or on interacting drugs [^116xsjtZ] [^113Mbx4o] [^111sZE8k] [^1125hA23].

> I need to check special populations and contexts. In pediatrics, electrolytes should be checked shortly after initiation and then periodically, reflecting higher vulnerability to dysnatremias. In cirrhosis with ascites, frequent clinical and biochemical monitoring is advised early in therapy. In hospitalized heart failure with IV diuretics, daily electrolytes and creatinine are standard during active titration. And in advanced CKD or when combining with RAAS inhibitors, closer potassium and creatinine surveillance is prudent given AKI and hyperkalemia risks [^1113KuJX] [^112zszzb] [^111aocJJ].

> Next, I should review emerging biomarkers. Spot urine sodium measured about 2 hours after a loop diuretic dose can help assess natriuretic response and guide escalation in acute heart failure; values less than roughly 50–70 mEq/L suggest diuretic resistance and support intensification, but I need to emphasize that this is best validated for inpatient ADHF and is not yet a substitute for routine BMP monitoring in stable outpatients. Similarly, NT-proBNP can track congestion and risk, yet guidelines do not recommend using natriuretic peptides alone to titrate diuretics in routine practice, so I should not overstate their role in day-to-day dosing decisions [^113Z49sd] [^114tZ5yB] [^111WLHZC] [^116UNB3J] [^116UNB3J].

> Hold on, I should verify the maintenance phase cadence. Once dose and labs are stable, repeating a BMP about every 3–6 months is reasonable, with annual checks at minimum in lower-risk patients; this aligns with ACC/AHA hypertension follow-up guidance and CKD monitoring principles, and it balances detection of delayed electrolyte shifts or renal effects against unnecessary testing [^116rreDx] [^111r5wu5].

> I will now examine what to do when labs are abnormal. If potassium is low, consider supplementation and/or adding or up-titrating an ACEi/ARB/MRA if clinically appropriate. If potassium is high, review drugs and diet, consider a loop or thiazide diuretic, and use potassium binders as needed. If creatinine rises more than 30% or eGFR falls more than 30%, reassess volume status, hold or reduce the diuretic if hypovolemic, and evaluate for other causes including NSAIDs or renal artery stenosis. These thresholds and actions are consistent with ACC/AHA and KDIGO guidance and help prevent reflexively stopping beneficial therapies [^116xsjtZ] [^113BTcZh] [^114BoXBC].

> But wait, what if the patient is on combination regimens or high diuretic doses. In HFrEF, when loop diuretics reach high daily doses or response is suboptimal, adding a thiazide-type diuretic can overcome nephronal adaptation; in this scenario, I should double-check electrolytes and creatinine within a week of the change due to heightened risk of hypokalemia and AKI, and consider MRAs or SGLT2 inhibitors that may permit diuretic sparing with careful lab surveillance [^114VxH5m] [^116qj6g9].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach. For most stable outpatients starting or up-titrating a diuretic, order a BMP now and repeat in 2–4 weeks. For high-risk patients (CKD, diabetes, elderly, polypharmacy, or high-dose/combination diuretics), shorten to 7–14 days. In hospitalized patients on IV diuretics, check electrolytes and creatinine daily during active titration. Once stable, monitor BMP every 3–6 months, or at least annually if low risk. Add spot urine sodium in ADHF to guide inpatient escalation, and consider NT-proBNP trends for risk stratification, not for routine diuretic titration in stable outpatients [^116xsjtZ] [^111sZE8k] [^111aocJJ] [^113Z49sd] [^116UNB3J].

> Finally, I should confirm documentation and follow-up logistics. I need to ensure the lab order explicitly states the rationale for timing tied to diuretic initiation or dose change, counsel patients on sick-day rules and symptoms of hypo/hyperkalemia, and arrange timely review of results; this reduces missed abnormalities and supports safe titration aligned with guideline-based care [^116xsjtZ] [^115rbuRg].

Monitor diuretic titration with a **basic metabolic panel (BMP)** to track electrolytes (Na, K), creatinine/eGFR, and bicarbonate, and check **2–4 weeks after initiation or dose change** [^116xsjtZ] [^113Mbx4o]. In high-risk patients (CKD, diabetes, elderly, or on high-dose/interacting drugs), **recheck at 7–14 days** [^111sZE8k] [^1125hA23]. Once stable, monitor every 3–6 months, or annually if low risk [^116rreDx]. For acute heart failure, check electrolytes and renal function daily during IV diuretic therapy [^111aocJJ]. Use spot urine sodium to assess diuretic response in acute settings, but do not replace BMP with urine sodium alone [^113Z49sd] [^114tZ5yB].

## Essential laboratory tests for diuretic titration

The following laboratory tests are **essential** for monitoring diuretic therapy:

| **Laboratory test** | **Parameters monitored** | **Clinical relevance** |
|-|-|-|
| Basic metabolic panel (BMP) | - Sodium (Na) <br/> - Potassium (K) <br/> - Chloride (Cl) <br/> - Bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) <br/> - Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) <br/> - Creatinine <br/> - eGFR | - Electrolyte disturbances (hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia) <br/> - Renal function <br/> - Acid-base balance [^116xsjtZ] [^113Mbx4o] |
| Spot urine sodium (UNa) | Sodium concentration in urine | Assesses diuretic response and guides dose adjustments in acute heart failure [^113Z49sd] [^114tZ5yB] |
| Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) | Cardiac biomarkers | Indicates congestion severity and guides diuretic titration in heart failure [^111kDHkp] [^116UNB3J] |

---

## Recommended frequency of laboratory monitoring

The frequency of laboratory monitoring **varies** with clinical context, patient risk, and diuretic dose:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended frequency** |
|-|-|
| Initiation or dose increase of diuretic | - 2–4 weeks after initiation or dose change [^116xsjtZ] [^113Mbx4o] <br/> - 7–14 days in high-risk patients (CKD, diabetes, elderly, high-dose/interacting drugs) [^111sZE8k] [^1125hA23] |
| Stable chronic diuretic therapy | Every 3–6 months; annually if low risk [^116rreDx] |
| Acute heart failure (IV diuretics) | Daily electrolytes and renal function during active titration [^111aocJJ] |
| Spot urine sodium (UNa) | - 2 hours after IV loop diuretic dose in acute heart failure [^113Z49sd] <br/> - Not routinely for outpatient monitoring |

---

## Clinical implications of laboratory abnormalities

Laboratory abnormalities during diuretic therapy **require prompt action**:

- **Hyponatremia**: Common with thiazide diuretics; monitor closely and adjust therapy [^116xsjtZ] [^113Mbx4o].
- **Hypokalemia**: Risk of arrhythmias; consider potassium supplementation or potassium-sparing diuretics [^11737NdY].
- **Hyperkalemia**: Risk with potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, MRAs; monitor and adjust therapy [^116xsjtZ] [^113Mbx4o].
- **Worsening renal function**: Evaluate volume status; adjust diuretic dose or hold if hypovolemic [^114BoXBC] [^11771YbR].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Basic metabolic panel (BMP)**: Essential for monitoring electrolytes and renal function; check 2–4 weeks after initiation or dose change, sooner in high-risk patients [^116xsjtZ] [^113Mbx4o].
- **Spot urine sodium (UNa)**: Useful in acute heart failure to assess diuretic response; not a substitute for BMP [^113Z49sd] [^114tZ5yB].
- **BNP/NT-proBNP**: Helpful for assessing congestion and guiding therapy in heart failure [^111kDHkp] [^116UNB3J].
- **Frequency**: Tailor to patient risk, clinical context, and diuretic dose; stable patients may be monitored every 3–6 months or annually [^116rreDx].

---

A basic metabolic panel is the **primary test** for diuretic titration, with timing individualized to patient risk and clinical context; spot urine sodium and natriuretic peptides can provide additional guidance in acute heart failure.

Kidney dysfunction/injury — monitoring and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor (RAASi) effects are outlined with explicit thresholds. Estimated GFR using serum creatinine should be measured 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose titration of antihypertensive medications. RAASi may cause an expected short-term dip in eGFR of up to 30% that is associated with preservation of kidney function and should not lead to discontinuation unless the decline in eGFR is persistently > 30%. A referral to a nephrologist is appropriate to evaluate other causes, and new dysfunction after adding or increasing diuretics should prompt evaluation of volume status; it may be appropriate to initially hold or reduce the diuretic dose and then advance more slowly.

How to down‐titrate diuretics after a temporary increase in ambulatory patients?

Despite the importance of loop diuretics in HF management and related adverse events, little effort has focused on 'optimizing' diuretics. A number of tools could help optimize diuretic treatment, including natriuretic peptide monitoring, pulmonary arterial pressure remote monitoring, or serial ultrasound imaging of the inferior vena cava, but in routine practice only clinical assessment is used in the vast majority of cases. Importantly, the first step should be to establish whether the previous dose should be considered as the correct posology or whether a higher dose is required. As a general rule, if the previous dose did not prevent WHF, a higher dose should be maintained for at least 3–4 weeks. Reinforcing GDMT will eventually help the down‐titration of loop diuretics.

### Urinary sodium analysis: the key to effective diuretic titration? European journal of heart failure expert consensus document [^111WLHZC]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

In patients with heart failure, neurohumoral activation leads to increased renal sodium avidity across the entire renal tubules, resulting in a positive sodium and water balance, leading to decompensated heart failure requiring intravenous diuretics. As the dose of diuretic therapy required to achieve euvolaemia is difficult to estimate due to considerable intra- and interindividual differences, the European Society of Cardiology recommends assessment of the diuretic response within hours either via evaluation of the urinary sodium concentration or via urinary volume after initial diuretic administration. All diuretic agents enhance sodium excretion to a different extent depending on their side of action across the renal tubules, and renal adaptation mechanisms due to neurohumoral stimulation. Impaired sodium excretion, even in the presence of fluid loss, is associated with worse clinical outcomes. Therefore, assessing urinary sodium excretion is considered a good and direct marker of the diuretic efficacy. Such natriuresis-guided protocols have been tested prospectively by the Pragmatic Urinary Sodium-based algoritHm in Acute Heart Failure and the Efficacy of a Standardized Diuretic Protocol in Acute Heart Failure study, both demonstrating increased natriuresis and diuresis. Moreover, the Readily Available Urinary Sodium Analysis in Patients with Acute Decompensated Heart Failure study has demonstrated that a nurse-led natriuresis-guided protocol is feasible through the use of a point-of-care urinary sodium sensor, allowing an immediately readable urinary sodium result, enabling fast changes in diuretic therapy. This review summaries the rationale, current evidence and gaps supporting the role of urinary sodium concentration in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.

### Furosemide (14-panel toxicology medicated collection system) [^111RwYru]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Edema

Therapy should be individualized according to patient response to gain maximal therapeutic response and to determine the minimal dose needed to maintain that response.

Adults

The usual initial dose of Furosemide tablets is 20 to 80 mg given as a single dose. Ordinarily a prompt diuresis ensues. If needed, the same dose can be administered 6 to 8 hours later or the dose may be increased. The dose may be raised by 20 or 40 mg and given not sooner than 6 to 8 hours after the previous dose until the desired diuretic effect has been obtained. The individually determined single dose should then be given once or twice daily (eg, at 8 am and 2 pm). The dose of Furosemide tablets may be carefully titrated up to 600 mg/day in patients with clinically severe edematous states.

Edema may be most efficiently and safely mobilized by giving Furosemide tablets on 2 to 4 consecutive days each week.

When doses exceeding 80 mg/day are given for prolonged periods, careful clinical observation and laboratory monitoring are particularly advisable. (See PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests.)

Geriatric patients

In general, dose selection for the elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).

Pediatric patients

The usual initial dose of oral Furosemide tablets in pediatric patients is 2 mg/kg body weight, given as a single dose. If the diuretic response is not satisfactory after the initial dose, dosage may be increased by 1 or 2 mg/kg no sooner than 6 to 8 hours after the previous dose. Doses greater than 6 mg/kg body weight are not recommended. For maintenance therapy in pediatric patients, the dose should be adjusted to the minimum effective level.

Table 13 — FDA-approved drugs for treatment of hypertension — Thiazide-type diuretics recommended for initial therapy list dosing and monitoring. Chlorthalidone 12.5–25 mg/d with daily frequency 1, hydrochlorothiazide 25–50 mg/d with daily frequency 1, and indapamide 1.25–2.5 mg/d with daily frequency 1 are provided. Chlorthalidone has a longer half-life and is more potent than hydrochlorothiazide on a mg-to-mg basis. Monitor for hyponatremia and hypokalemia, increased glucose, uric acid, and calcium levels, and monitor patients with history of acute gout unless patient is on uric acid-lowering therapy.

Algorithm for monitoring of potassium and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) after initiation of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors — After starting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), the algorithm states to monitor laboratories and timing as "Monitor serum creatinine and potassium (within 2–4 weeks after starting or changing dose)". If there is " < 30% decrease in eGFR", the action is "Increase dose of ACEi or ARB or continue on maximally tolerated dose". For hyperkalemia, the box lists: "Hyperkalemia… Review concurrent drugs… Moderate dietary potassium intake… Consider: - diuretics - sodium bicarbonate - potassium binders". If there is " ≥ 30% decrease in eGFR", actions are "Review for causes of AKI… Correct volume depletion… Reassess concomitant medications (e.g., diuretics, NSAIDs)… Consider renal artery stenosis". If these measures fail, the algorithm advises "Reduce dose or stop ACEi or ARB if mitigation strategies ineffective".

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Electrolyte imbalances in hypertension — assessment of electrolytes is important for evaluating causes of hypertension and monitoring adverse effects with treatment. A basic metabolic panel should be checked at the time of diagnosis of hypertension to evaluate for secondary hypertension and should be checked 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose titration of specific antihypertensive medication classes, including diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA). Common laboratory disturbances relate to changes in potassium, sodium, or creatinine; hypokalemia may be caused by kaliuresis from thiazide-type and loop diuretics, whereas hyperkalemia may be caused by ACEi, ARB, MRA, and potassium-sparing diuretics especially when used in combination or in the setting of chronic kidney disease. ACEi and ARB should not be used concurrently due to several trials demonstrating an increased risk for AKI or renal dysfunction. Hyponatremia may be caused by diuretics, in particular thiazide-type diuretics. Strategies to mitigate electrolyte disturbances include dietary changes, electrolyte supplementation, and combination use of medications with complementary effects on electrolytes (eg, ACEi plus thiazide-type or loop diuretic, which may normalize potassium levels). Treatment of hyperkalemia can also be managed with initiation of potassium-lowering binders (including patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate), noting the importance of taking them (primarily patiromer) mid-day apart from other medications to avoid interfering with absorption; if severe or life-threatening electrolyte imbalances occur, the causative medication should be discontinued and the imbalance treated immediately.

Glomerular disease — monitoring, sick-day guidance, and management of hyperkalemia and acidosis with RAS blockade: Monitor labs frequently if on ACEi or ARB. Titration of ACEi or ARB may cause acute kidney injury or hyperkalemia. Counsel patients to hold ACEi or ARB and diuretics when at risk for volume depletion, with increased risk for acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia; consider transiently stopping RASi during sick days and counsel patients according to level of education in a culturally sensitive manner. Use potassium-wasting diuretics and/or potassium-binding agents to reduce serum potassium to normal, in order to use RAS blocking medications for BP control and proteinuria reduction, including loop diuretics, thiazide diuretics, patiromer, and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate; each 10 g of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate contains 800 mg of sodium. Treat metabolic acidosis (serum bicarbonate < 22 mmol/l) and supplement with oral sodium bicarbonate.

### Management of hyperkalemia during treatment with mineralocorticoid receptor blockers: findings from esaxerenone [^111Fa4pA]. Hypertension Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Monitoring

In the general patient population, potassium levels are often elevated. Approximately 6.8% of the Japanese population is estimated to have hyperkalemia (defined as at least two serum potassium readings ≥ 5.1 mEq/L) based on the results of a medical database analysis. Similarly, a Swedish study examining 364,955 patients who accessed healthcare over a 3-year period revealed a 7% incidence of hyperkalemia (defined as potassium > 5 mEq/L) with a 35.7% rate of recurrence.

Regular monitoring allows drug dosages to be adjusted based on serum potassium levels. A long-term potassium monitoring study in patients with heart failure suggested that maintenance of serum potassium levels within the normal range should be considered a therapeutic target, allowing clinicians to modify treatment and mitigate risks to improve clinical outcomes for patients. In patients with diabetes being treated with an ACE inhibitor, ARB, or spironolactone, compared with no monitoring, regular monitoring of serum potassium has been shown to decrease the risk of hyperkalemia-related adverse events (adjusted relative risk 0.5, 95% CI 0.37–0.66). According to the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative, the suggested frequency of serum potassium monitoring after initiation of ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy is as follows: every 4–12 weeks for serum potassium ≤ 4.5 mEq/L, every 2–4 weeks for 4.6–5 mEq/L, and more frequently than every 2 weeks for > 5 mEq/L. The American Heart Association states that potassium levels and renal function should typically be checked on days 3 and 7 after initiating therapy with aldosterone antagonists and then at least monthly for the first 3 months. However, the frequency of serum potassium measurement is not described in the guidelines published by the Japanese Society of Nephrology or Japanese societies related to CVD.

To avoid the risk of false positive findings, serum potassium levels need to be measured carefully. Causes of false positives include hemolysis, delay in sample processing, long-term cold storage, and contamination of blood samples with antiseptics or potassium salts from blood collection tubes. Careful collection techniques and proper sample handling and storage are therefore essential.

Additional suggestions for clinicians intending to prescribe RAASis include pretreatment GFR and baseline serum potassium determination (to identify or exclude high-risk patients), dosage titration, and discontinuation of potassium supplements or concomitant maintenance treatment with loop or thiazide diuretics.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Loop diuretic therapy in hospitalized heart failure — dosing and monitoring is outlined as follows: Table 7A provides guidance on timing and dosing for initiation of sacubitril/valsartan based on patient profile as represented in the randomized ARNI trials; subsequent IV diuretic doses are modified to achieve the desired daily response, and doses are often doubled until reaching 400 to 500 mg of furosemide equivalent per day; when the response is brisk but transient, the frequency should be increased to 3 to 4 times daily; the DOSE trial did not demonstrate improved outcomes with continuous infusion of IV furosemide, but patients with chronic furosemide equivalent doses of over 240 mg daily were excluded, while a Cochrane review suggested that loop diuretic agent infusions may produce greater net diuresis and better tolerability at equivalent doses compared with bolus dosing; measurement of urine sodium shortly after the start of therapy can be useful to evaluate diuretic responsiveness, with a spot urine sodium content < 50 mEq/L at 2 hours after the diuretic dose correlated with a poor diuretic response and suggests consideration of dose.

### Home-based urinary sodium monitoring via point-of-care testing for personalized diuretic titration in heart failure management: the EASY-STOP study [^112ZzBWV]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Loop diuretics alleviate symptoms in heart failure (HF), but despite recommendations for dynamic dosing, implementation in practice remains challenging. The EASY-STOP trial investigated whether ambulatory urinary sodium monitoring using a point-of-care sensor could guide diuretic down-titration.

Methods and Results

This prospective, single-centre study enrolled 50 euvolaemic HF patients on stable guideline-directed medical therapy for ≥ 3months and receiving maintenance loop diuretic (≥ 20mg furosemide equivalent daily). After a 1-week baseline phase of daily self-measured first-void and post-diuretic urinary sodium assessment, loop diuretics were gradually reduced by 50% and discontinued when ≤ 20mg furosemide equivalents. Urinary monitoring continued for another 3weeks. Successful down-titration was defined as remaining congestion-free (no rise in New York Heart Association class ≥ I, oedema, pleural effusion, ascites, rise in right ventricular systolic pressure ≥ 10mmHg, or worsening diastolic dysfunction ≥ 1 grade). Investigators and patients were blinded for urinary sodium analysis during the study. Patients were 75 (68–79) years old, had left ventricular ejection fraction 46(± 11)%, estimated glomerular filtration rate 47(35–65)ml/min and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide 899(326–2558)ng/L. Among the 50 patients, 62 diuretic down-titrations were performed, of which 34 (55%) were successful. Baseline urinary sodium before loop diuretic down-titration was similar between groups. However, patients who successfully achieved down-titration exhibited a significant increase in first-void urinary sodium following down-titration (53-74mmol/L, p < 0.001), whereas those requiring reinitiation showed no significant change (56-58mmol/L, p = 0.331). A 10mmol/L increase predicted successful down-titration with 79.4% sensitivity and 78.6% specificity (area under the curve = 0.851).

Conclusions

Point-of-care urinary sodium monitoring may represent a non-invasive and personalized approach to diuretic titration in HF management. Further trials are warranted to validate its clinical utility and long-term benefits.

KDIGO dialysis interventions for treatment of AKI — RRT initiation, decision context, discontinuation, and diuretics: Initiate RRT emergently when life-threatening changes in fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base balance exist (Not Graded). Consider the broader clinical context, the presence of conditions that can be modified with RRT, and trends of laboratory tests — rather than single BUN and creatinine thresholds alone — when making the decision to start RRT (Not Graded). Discontinue RRT when it is no longer required, either because intrinsic kidney function has recovered to the point that it is adequate to meet patient needs, or because RRT is no longer consistent with the goals of care (Not Graded). We suggest not using diuretics to enhance kidney function recovery, or to reduce the duration or frequency of RRT (2B).

Hypertension medication changes — follow-up and monitoring specify that the addition of new medications or intensification of current medications requires follow-up to monitor BP response and the potential for adverse effects, and high-quality randomized controlled trials have successfully and safely developed strategies for follow-up, monitoring, and reassessment for management of BP from which recommendations can be made. Components of the follow-up evaluation should include assessment in the office and, when possible, outside of the office (eg, telehealth), for BP control, including evaluation for OH, adverse drug effects, adherence to medication and lifestyle therapy, need for additional therapeutic intensification of medication dosing, and indicated laboratory testing (eg, electrolytes, renal function, target organ damage).

HFpEF — AOM monitoring and dose escalation: The integration of AOM in obesity-related HF requires structured monitoring across initiation, titration with metabolic and HF-specific surveillance, and long-term follow-up; pre-initiation assessment ensures clinical stability with baseline laboratory evaluation including kidney function, electrolytes, and HbA1c; adverse events reported in the trials were predominantly gastrointestinal; during early-phase gradual dose escalation, which occurs every 4 weeks, monitoring should include kidney function and electrolyte reassessment with adjustment of diuretics, antihypertensive agents, and antihyperglycemic agents as indicated; for insulin-dependent individuals, glucose should be monitored to avoid hypoglycemia.

FIGURE 2
Comorbidities that can cause elevated natriuretic peptide levels and factors known to affect the interpretation of natriuretic peptide assays.

Recently it has been suggested that natriuretic peptides can be used during the diagnosis of heart failure to identify particularly high‐risk individuals who would merit more expedited review and investigation. This is due to the recognition that higher natriuretic peptide levels at diagnosis are associated with a higher risk of hospitalisation or death. As with the diagnosis of heart failure there is ample evidence that higher natriuretic peptides are associated with a higher risk of hospitalisations, cardiovascular death and all‐cause death in patients with prevalent heart failure. This relationship is seen across the spectrum of ejection fraction and rising levels of natriuretic peptides are associated with a poorer prognosis and falling levels with a better prognosis. Currently there is little evidence that any of the guideline‐recommended therapies should be initiated on the basis of natriuretic peptide levels. While natriuretic peptides have been used to enrich trial populations for risk of subsequent events and confirm the diagnosis of heart failure, guidelines do not recommend their use for selecting patients for therapy. They can be used to monitor risk but how to incorporate natriuretic peptide monitoring into clinical practice is yet unclear. There is some evidence that NT‐proBNP can be incorporated into an up‐titration algorithm for guideline‐recommended therapies in heart failure. In the STRONG‐HF (Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of Rapid Optimization, Helped by N‐Terminal Pro–Brain Natriuretic Peptide Testing of Heart Failure Therapies) trial, changes in NT‐proBNP were incorporated into an algorithm for the rapid up‐titration of guideline‐recommended therapies for heart failure following discharge from hospital. They were used in conjunction with standard physical examination (e.g. blood pressure, heart rate) and laboratory measures (e.g. serum potassium and kidney function) to help up‐titrate beta blockers, inhibitors of the renin‐angiotensin aldosterone system and loop diuretics. While this trial showed a benefit of rapid up‐titration the precise contribution of NT‐proBNP measures to the results is not clear as it is hard to dissect its contribution from the other aspects of the algorithm.

Testing and medication titration following diagnosis of HFrEF outlines an initial evaluation, iterative medication adjustment, timelines, reassessment, and referral triggers. Studies to consider initially include BNP/NT-proBNP, CBC and basic metabolic panel, ECG, chest X-ray, echocardiogram, and, as appropriate, coronary angiogram/CMR/endomyocardial biopsy. Serial evaluation and titration specify clinic visits with history, vitals, exam, and labs; if volume status requires treatment, adjust diuretic agents with follow-up in 1–2 weeks; if euvolemic and stable, start/increase/switch GDMT with follow-up in 1–2 weeks via virtual visit or repeat clinic visit with basic metabolic panel, as indicated, and repeat the cycle until no further changes are possible or tolerated. The pathway labels intensification as 1–3 week cycles during lack of response/instability, and notes stabilization ~3 months, after which response and cardiac remodeling are assessed by repeating labs (e.g. BNP/NT-proBNP and basic metabolic panel), repeating echocardiogram, repeating ECG, and considering EP referral for those eligible for CRT or ICD; end‑intensification/maintenance emphasizes ongoing assessment, additional adjustments, and repeating objective data as needed. To assist in decision making for referral to an advanced heart failure specialist, the I‑NEED‑HELP acronym lists triggers including Ejection fraction ≤ 35% and Hospitalizations > 1, along with intravenous inotropes, NYHA IIIB/IV or persistently elevated natriuretic peptides, end-organ dysfunction, defibrillator shocks, edema despite escalating diuretics, low blood pressure/high heart rate, and prognostic medication intolerance or down‑titration of GDMT. Additionally, among patients with HFrEF, lowering NT‑proBNP to < 1,000 pg/mL was associated with significant reverse remodeling and improved outcomes.

### Outpatient monitoring and treatment of chronic heart failure guided by amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide measurement [^115ykb4U]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is a strong and independent prognostic marker in patients across the spectrum of heart failure (HF) stages, including patients managed in the outpatient setting. Serial measures of NT-proBNP are more valuable than single measures for prognosis, and biologic variation of the marker should allow serial monitoring. Furthermore, given that NT-proBNP levels decrease in response to the addition of therapies with proven benefit for HF (including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, diuretics, spironolactone, exercise therapy, and biventricular pacing), it is logical to expect that targeting therapy to decrease NT-proBNP levels may facilitate more optimal use of proven HF therapies and may reduce adverse clinical outcomes. The optimal strategy for NT-proBNP monitoring with regard to frequency of testing or whether to use standard or individualized targets is still being determined. Preliminary results are promising for targeting an outpatient NT-proBNP concentration of approximately ≤ 1,000 ng/L. Current data suggest that when NT-proBNP levels are not at goal or increase from prior measurements, the risk for hazard is increased. Adjustments in treatment and serial clinical follow-up with NT-proBNP retesting should be considered at frequent intervals until biochemical stabilization or achievement of a maximally tolerated medical program.

### Furosemide, benzalkonium chloride (UDSx medicated system) [^116SVPqL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Edema

Therapy should be individualized according to patient response to gain maximal therapeutic response and to determine the minimal dose needed to maintain that response.

Adults -

The usual initial dose of furosemide tablets is 20 to 80 mg given as a single dose. Ordinarily a prompt diuresis ensues. If needed, the same dose can be administered 6 to 8 hours later or the dose may be increased. The dose may be raised by 20 or 40 mg and given not sooner than 6 to 8 hours after the previous dose until the desired diuretic effect has been obtained. The individually determined single dose should then be given once or twice daily (e.g., at 8 am and 2 pm). The dose of furosemide tablets may be carefully titrated up to 600 mg/day in patients with clinically severe edematous states.

Edema may be most efficiently and safely mobilized by giving furosemide tablets on 2 to 4 consecutive days each week.

When doses exceeding 80 mg/day are given for prolonged periods, careful clinical observation and laboratory monitoring are particularly advisable (see PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests).

Geriatric Patients -

In general, dose selection for the elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).

Pediatric Patients -

The usual initial dose of oral furosemide in pediatric patients is 2 mg/kg body weight, given as a single dose. If the diuretic response is not satisfactory after the initial dose, dosage may be increased by 1 or 2 mg/kg no sooner than 6 to 8 hours after the previous dose. Doses greater than 6 mg/kg body weight are not recommended. For maintenance therapy in pediatric patients, the dose should be adjusted to the minimum effective level.

### Exploring safety of down-titrating diuretics in heart failure management [^113awVs5]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) is a chronic disease that is characterized by an array of debilitating signs and symptoms. The disease manifests, among others, through episodes of sudden worsening of symptoms due to fluid retention, called decompensation. Treatment of these episodes often requires close‐monitor care and the use of (intravenous) diuretic therapy. It is the most prominent cause of hospital admission in elderly patients. This escalating trend in hospitalizations coupled with the growing prevalence of HF has led the disease to become one of the leading causes in healthcare costs worldwide.

In the management of HF, the core objectives are to stabilize the disease, relieve patients of their symptoms, and prevent or minimize episodes of decompensation. Achieving these goals involves the use of disease‐modifying therapy, that is, the 'fantastic four' in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), in addition to sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in HF with preserved LVEF, which have demonstrated efficacy across the entire range of LVEF. Moreover, loop diuretics play a pivotal role as the main treatment for congestion. The most recent HF guidelines advise treating patients with the lowest possible dose of loop diuretics to reach and maintain euvolaemia. In other words, down‐titration of the dose of loop diuretics should be considered after euvolaemia is achieved. However, this recommendation is based on expert opinion only and lacks scientific evidence. Conversely, the implementation of invasive monitoring through implantable devices in patients with chronic HF revealed a predominance of dose increases over decreases, resulting in reduced hospitalization rates. Therefore, it remains unclear how to optimize diuretic therapy adjustments and whether a reduction in diuretic therapy can be considered safe.

To gain further insight into the effects of changes in diuretic therapy, we conducted a retrospective post‐hoc analysis using data from the Trial of Intensified versus standard Medical therapy in Elderly patients with Congestive Heart Failure (TIME‐CHF), which provides daily information on all drugs used including doses during 18 months. Our primary aim was to provide a more data‐driven perspective on the effects and implications of changes in loop diuretic therapy in HF patients.

### Flexible diuretic titration in chronic heart failure: where is the evidence? [^115S2ogt]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Several sets of heart failure (HF) consensus/guideline statements support the use of a flexible diuretic dosing regimen for HF outpatient management of fluid overload-related signs and symptoms. However, despite the widespread acceptance of such an approach, the evidence supporting the effectiveness of this approach in improving clinical outcomes is unknown. The primary objective of this manuscript was to summarize and review the evidence supporting the use of a flexible diuretic regimen in the management of outpatient heart failure patients.

Methods and Results

A systematic review was performed, and 9 studies were identified relevant to the question of flexible diuretic titration in the setting of chronic heart failure. Among the 9 studies, 5 were randomized. Three of the randomized trials included flexible diuretic titration as part of a broader multifaceted disease management program, and only 2 were designed to specifically evaluate the sole contribution of flexible diuretic titration. Collectively, data from all of the studies reviewed supported the idea that flexible and individualized diuretic dosing is potentially associated with reduced emergency room visits, reduced rehospitalization, and improved quality of life in HF patients with reduced ejection fraction.

Conclusions

To date, only 2 randomized clinical studies were identified that were designed to determine the effects of a flexible diuretic dosing regimen in outpatient HF patients with reduced ejection fraction. Data are lacking in HF patients with preserved ejection fraction. There is a critical need to test this strategy in well designed prospective randomized clinical trials.

Figure 3 — Diuretic agents for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) outlines dosing selection, titration, potential dose reduction with other therapies, high-dose strategies, and monitoring: Select initial loop diuretic agent dose: Initial dose depends on multiple factors including kidney function and prior exposure to diuretic therapy. Titrate dose to relief of congestion over days to weeks. In some instances, it may be necessary to reduce diuretic dosing in the setting of increasing doses of ARNI/ACEI/ARB and/or initiation of SGLT inhibitor. If reaching high doses of loop diuretic agent (ie, equivalent of 80 mg of furosemide twice daily) consider a. changing to a different loop diuretic agent or b. adding thiazide diuretic, taken together with loop diuretic agent. Monitor blood pressure, electrolytes, and kidney function after initiation and during titration.

### Exploring safety of down-titrating diuretics in heart failure management [^112ZFHAM]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical assessment of fluid status is challenging, and signs and symptoms often occur late. Thus, haemodynamic assessment may identify the need of patients for safe and effective changes in diuretic therapy, although this was not the specific aim of these trials. Also, various biomarkers have been proposed to assess congestion, as well as imaging toolsand the use of artificial intelligence. However, there is not sufficient evidence currently that diuretic therapy guidance using these tools may improve outcomes. Our data highlight the need for such specific trials and suggest significant room for improvement in the management of HF patients regarding diuretic therapy.

This study has several limitations that need to be mentioned. Firstly and most importantly, this was a post‐hoc analysis and patients were not randomized to down‐titration versus stable diuretic therapy. Therefore, our results are hypothesis‐generating only. Secondly, a major limitation of our work is the lack of other HF medication usage and dosage of patients during the trial. These can strongly affect the stability of HF patients and influence the decision‐making of clinicians with regard to diuretics. Thirdly, the exact volume status was not known at the time of dose change if done outside of study visits, nor is the application of fluid or salt restriction known for patients. This is of particular importance in the case of renal dysfunction, which may be related to different reasons including both dehydration and volume overload. Also, hypotension may be caused by dehydration or worsening of HF. Thus, it cannot be excluded that down‐titration was done despite volume overload in some cases. Nevertheless, the availability of information on why diuretic doses were changed is a major strength of our study.

### Exploring safety of down-titrating diuretics in heart failure management [^111TzNei]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

A long‐term registry investigating the association between loop diuretic dose changes at baseline and outcomes in chronic HF after 12 months concluded that diuretic dose increase was associated with HF death. Contrary to our findings, they additionally imply that down‐titration of loop diuretic dose was associated with lower HF and cardiovascular mortality, although the results were not statistically significant. The major difference in their approach is that they only take into account one single dose evaluation moment at baseline, without accounting for any subsequent dose changes that might have occurred closer to the event. In contrast, our study incorporates daily dose data and multiple dose evaluations throughout the analysis period. This methodological difference may explain the contrasting findings between the two studies.

While diuretic dose escalation is widely recognized as a response to worsening congestion and disease progression, often correlating with increased mortality risk, down‐titration is generally considered a marker of clinical improvement. However, our findings challenge this assumption, suggesting that patients undergoing diuretic reduction may still be at a heightened risk. This highlights the complexity of interpreting dose adjustments in clinical practice. The observed risk could reflect residual congestion despite dose reduction, or it may indicate a shift in management due to concurrent changes in renal function, blood pressure, or HF therapy. Prior studies have primarily focused on the risks of diuretic intensification, leaving the implications of down‐titration less well understood. Our findings suggest a need for careful patient selection and close monitoring following diuretic reductions, particularly in the absence of standardized criteria to guide these adjustments. Future research should further explore this interplay between diuretic down‐titration, HF progression, and comprehensive treatment strategies that incorporate contemporary HF therapies and precision medicine.

### Baseline and follow-up laboratory monitoring of cardiovascular medications [^116MA36e]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Laboratory monitoring of medications is typically used to establish safety prior to drug initiation and to detect drug-related injury following initiation. It is unclear whether black box warnings (BBWs) as well as evidence- and consensus-based clinical guidelines increase the likelihood of appropriate monitoring.

Objective

To determine the proportion of patients newly initiated on selected cardiovascular medications with baseline assessment and follow-up laboratory monitoring and compare the prevalence of laboratory testing for drugs with and without BBWs and guidelines.

Methods

This cross-sectional study included patients aged 18 years or older from a large multispecialty group practice who were prescribed a cardiovascular medication (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, amiodarone, digoxin, lipid-lowering agents, diuretics, and potassium supplements) between January 1 and July 31, 2008. The primary outcome measure was laboratory test ordering for baseline assessment and follow-up monitoring of newly initiated cardiovascular medications.

Results

The number of new users of each study drug ranged from 49 to 1757 during the study period. Baseline laboratory test ordering across study drugs ranged from 37.4% to 94.8%, and follow-up laboratory test ordering ranged from 20.0% to 77.2%. Laboratory tests for drugs with baseline laboratory assessment recommendations in BBWs were more commonly ordered than for drugs without BBWs (86.4% vs 78.0%, p < 0.001). Drugs with follow-up monitoring recommendations in clinical guidelines had a lower prevalence of monitoring (33.1% vs 50.7%, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Baseline assessment of cardiovascular medication monitoring is variable. Quality measurement of adherence to BBW recommendations may improve monitoring.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) dosing and titration: To achieve maximal benefits, therapies must be rapidly initiated and titrated to maximally tolerated doses, and doses higher than those studied in randomized clinical trials are generally not recommended; rapid achievement of target or maximally tolerated doses is the goal, and more than 1 drug may be started and, in certain circumstances, all 4 classes may be started at once. Beta‑blocker doses should be adjusted every 1 to 2 weeks in a patient with no evidence of decompensated HF or contraindications, and for those taking an ARNI, doses can be increased every week with monitoring of kidney function, potassium, and blood pressure; for optimal ARNI titration, lower loop diuretic doses and restriction of supplemental and/or dietary potassium may be necessary.

### Remote cardiovascular hypertension program enhanced blood pressure control during the COVID-19 pandemic [^116uVN9G]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

A clinical, evidence‐based algorithm for hypertension management (including medication initiation, dose escalation, and laboratory monitoring) was developed internally in accordance with society guideline recommendations, and has been previously described and is outlined in Figure S1A and Figure S2. The algorithm recommended first‐line management with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), or dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, based on patient demographic and clinical characteristics.

The algorithm was implemented by teams of nonlicensed navigators, who were trained and supervised by pharmacists prescribing under a Mass General Brigham Collaborative Drug Therapy Management program. A physician disease expert oversaw the pharmacists and the entire program. Our suite of software applications provided electronic decision support and standardized workflows to facilitate automation of the clinical algorithm. The algorithm was implemented until patients reached "maintenance" phase, defined as cessation of active titration due to achievement or close approximation (within 1–2 mm Hg) of goal BP. Transitioning a patient who was not quite at goal BP to maintenance resulted from clinical discussions based on medical judgment and patient preference. The primary mode of communication between enrolled patients and navigators was the telephone. Additional communication modalities of messaging by text or through our secure electronic portal were used based on patient preference.

Program Adaptations

As the COVID‐19 caseload increased in Massachusetts, the algorithm was modified to address pandemic‐related challenges. Through the early stages of complete lockdown and beyond, patients were averse to leaving home to have blood drawn at a clinic or laboratory. Therefore, a decision was made to remove ARBs and ACEIs as first‐line drugs. Calcium channel blockers rose to the top of the prescribing algorithm for most patients. Importantly, this decision was not made because of concerns that ARBs and ACEIs might increase the risk of COVID‐19; our program followed professional society recommendations that these medications should not be discontinued because of concerns about COVID‐19. If a patient's BP was clearly hypertensive and treatment with an ARB, ACEI, or diuretic was required, conservative dosing was initialized to maximize safety. In addition, the mandate for laboratory testing was relaxed for patients being titrated to intermediate doses of drugs; laboratory values were always obtained when final doses were reached. Beta blockers and/or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists were used if an additional agent was needed. These adaptations to our clinical algorithm are presented in Figure S1B.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Electrolyte imbalances — assessment and monitoring: A basic metabolic panel should be checked at the time of diagnosis of hypertension to evaluate for secondary hypertension, including primary or secondary Aldosteronism and other endocrine causes, and a basic metabolic panel should be checked 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose titration of specific antihypertensive medication classes, including diuretics, ACEi (angiotensin‑converting enzyme inhibitor), ARB (angiotensin receptor blocker), and MRA (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist). Common lab disturbances relate to changes in potassium, sodium, or creatinine. Hypokalemia may be caused by kaliuresis from thiazide‑type and loop diuretics, whereas hyperkalemia may be caused by ACEi, ARB, MRA, and potassium‑sparing diuretics especially when used in combination or in the setting of CKD. ACEi and ARB should not be used concurrently due to several trials demonstrating an increased risk for AKI or renal dysfunction. Hyponatremia may be caused by diuretics, in particular thiazide‑type diuretics. Strategies to mitigate electrolyte disturbances include dietary changes, electrolyte supplementation, and combination use of medications with complementary effects on electrolytes (eg, ACEi plus thiazide‑type or loop diuretic, which may normalize potassium levels). Treatment of hyperkalemia, other than emergency treatment for life‑threatening hyperkalemia, can also be managed with initiation of potassium‑lowering binders (including patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate), noting the importance of taking them (primarily patiromer) mid‑day apart from other medications to avoid interfering with absorption; if severe or life‑threatening electrolyte imbalances occur, the causative medication should be discontinued and the imbalance treated immediately.

### Searching for evidence: refractory questions in advanced heart failure [^113cTvuQ]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Despite ample data from randomized clinical trials (RCTs), the management of advanced heart failure (HF) varies greatly. We examined the most common refractory questions arising in routine inpatient management of advanced HF.

Methods

From the inpatient HF service at 1 hospital, we prospectively recorded clinical questions arising for which there were no clear answers available about HF management. When possible, patients received angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, and spironolactone as used in RCTs. We identified the topics and frequencies of questions and categorized them as Group 1 — whether to use a therapy — or Group 2 — how to use a therapy.

Results

During 2 separate months, 318 questions arose among 57 patients. The most common topics involved the use of diuretics, potassium, and ACE inhibitors, most often about how to titrate diuretics, what targets to use to optimize diuretic therapy, and how to select discharge doses of diuretics. Questions of whether to use a therapy occurred 73 times, and how to use a therapy, 242 times. RCT data were difficult to apply to these questions because little information exists about how to combine and titrate HF drugs and how to adjust diuretics. Questions about individual drugs arose in patients who fell outside the average RCT entry criteria for age, blood pressure, and creatinine.

Conclusion

Most refractory questions focused on how to integrate and adjust therapies within the overall medical regimen and how to apply data to patients not represented in RCTs. Future studies should evaluate strategies of care for the advanced HF population.

### Association of changes in creatinine and potassium levels after initiation of renin angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors with emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and mortality in individuals with chronic kidney disease [^114etVya]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Our findings suggest that structured laboratory monitoring during RAASI and diuretic therapy initiation may be used to guide appropriate continuation of therapy in individuals with initial changes in kidney function. The acute changes in creatinine levels often resolved on follow-up testing and were not associated with near-term risks of combined ED visit and hospitalization or mortality. Given this finding, the benefits of RAASI therapy in blood pressure control, proteinuria reduction, and long-term preservation of kidney function could outweigh the risk of acute rises in creatinine levels for most individuals with CKD. Furthermore, 2 weeks after treatment initiation may not be a sufficient time to assess renal function and recommendations for retesting to confirm a persistent rise in creatinine level before discontinuing RAASI therapy, as supported by our findings.

Strengths and Limitations

The strengths of the study lie largely within its natural outgrowth of patient care to address questions pertinent to a wide audience of health care professionals. Serum creatinine level was selected as the marker of kidney function, given its use in clinical practice, and a change of at least 30% was selected because this level has been advocated as a threshold for RAASI therapy discontinuation despite the limitations of creatinine level as an indicator of eGFR. Primary care practices were selected rather than specialty clinics to minimize the likelihood of off-site laboratory follow-up. Individuals receiving new diuretic prescriptions were included to contextualize these changes, given the prevalence of diuretic use in the outpatient setting in individuals with CKD and frequency of electrolyte disturbances requiring close laboratory monitoring. Care was taken to minimize comparisons between RAASI and diuretic prescriptions, given the risk of confounding by indication.

The study has several limitations. We required a follow-up laboratory measurement within 90 days of the medication prescription date because our goal was to investigate acute laboratory measurement changes. Laboratory values measured outside this period were less likely to be ordered for follow-up after a new RAASI or diuretic prescription. This time frame also gives individuals adequate opportunity to fill prescriptions and present for laboratory follow-up. Physicians may select closer laboratory follow-up for individuals with a higher burden of comorbidities or abnormal laboratories at baseline, thereby self-selecting for a higher risk population, and our data should be extrapolated cautiously. Similarly, we required 3 eGFR values within the year before the medication start date for our measure of CKD. As opposed to a single eGFR value, this criterion improves confidence in the diagnosis and stage of CKD, but as stated above, it may limit generalizability to individuals who may be selected for frequent monitoring.

### The challenge of hyponatremia [^116yEj9k]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia often challenges clinicians on many counts. Despite similar serum sodium concentrations, clinical manifestations can range from mild to life threatening. Some patients require active management, whereas others recover without intervention. Therapeutic measures frequently yield safe correction, yet the same measures can result in osmotic demyelination. To address this challenge, we present a practical approach to managing hyponatremia that centers on two elements: a diagnostic evaluation directed at the pathogenesis and putative causes of hyponatremia, the case-specific clinical and laboratory features, and the associated clinical risk; and a management plan tailored to the diagnostic findings that incorporates quantitative projections of fluid therapy and fluid losses on the patient's serum sodium, balances potential benefits and risks, and emphasizes vigilant monitoring. These principles should enable the clinician to formulate a management plan that addresses expeditiously three critical questions: Which of the determinants of the serum sodium are deranged and what is the underlying culprit? How urgent is the need for intervention? What specific therapy should be instituted and which are the associated pitfalls?

### Exploring safety of down-titrating diuretics in heart failure management [^116n7r6b]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Re‐evaluation of the current belief in the need for dose reduction of loop diuretics is required. Our study highlights that caution is required if diuretic dosages are reduced in the management of HF patients as currently advised. We have observed a notable risk of needing to reinitiate or increase diuretics within a short timeframe following such reductions. In addition, there may be an increased risk involved. Prospective interventional studies are needed to define the exact role of diuretics in HF and understand the long‐term risks and benefits of adjusting diuretic therapy.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Electrolyte imbalances — assessment of electrolytes is important for evaluating causes of hypertension and monitoring adverse effects with treatment; a basic metabolic panel should be checked at the time of diagnosis of hypertension and 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose titration of diuretics, ACEi, ARB, and MRA. Hypokalemia may be caused by kaliuresis from thiazide-type and loop diuretics, and hyperkalemia may be caused by ACEi, ARB, MRA, and potassium-sparing diuretics, especially when used in combination or in chronic kidney disease; ACEi and ARB should not be used concurrently due to increased risk for AKI or renal dysfunction. Mitigation strategies include dietary changes, electrolyte supplementation, and combining medications with complementary electrolyte effects (for example, ACEi plus a thiazide-type or loop diuretic); treatment of hyperkalemia can include initiation of potassium-lowering drugs including patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, with emphasis on taking them mid-day apart from other medications to avoid interfering with absorption; if severe or life-threatening electrolyte imbalances occur, the causative medication should be discontinued and the imbalance treated immediately.

### Tolvaptan for the treatment of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^112U3VUs]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

The third research question relates to the main safety concern of tolvaptan, the likelihood for overly rapid hyponatraemia correction. Specifically, we need to establish the effectiveness and safety of tolvaptan in patients with very low serum sodium, for example, below 120 mmol/litre, who are most in need of hyponatraemia correction, and at the same time are exposed to the greatest risk of overcorrection. What is the magnitude of this risk when tolvaptan is used under stringent protocols, encompassing close electrolyte/fluid balance monitoring and measures to halt/reverse too rapid correction? In the era of personalised medicine, large prospective studies are warranted to demonstrate the parameters that can predict the magnitude of response to tolvaptan and are associated with high likelihood for over-rapid sodium correction. These data would provide the evidence basis for the development of a risk calculator for tolvaptan-related overly rapid sodium increase, individualising the starting dose and monitoring of tolvaptan. Various protocols of tolvaptan initiation, titration, monitoring and corrective measures should be prospectively tested to develop an algorithm for tolvaptan use, readily applicable to clinical practice, achieving maximal drug efficacy and safety. For example, an open-label randomisation trial is in progress, randomising patients with non-hypovolaemic hyponatraemia to receive either 7.5 mg tolvaptan or fluid restriction imposed at 1000 ml/day, testing the hypothesis that tolvaptan can improve the rate of sodium correction as well as clinical outcomes, without exposing the patients at high risk of serum sodium overcorrection. These studies will determine the utility of tolvaptan in clinical practice and provide an evidence-based framework for tolvaptan administration and monitoring.

### ACC / AHA 2005 guideline update for the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in the adult: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to update the 2001 guidelines for the evaluation and management of heart failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society [^11737NdY]. Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Laboratory assessment in heart failure (HF) includes routine monitoring of serum electrolytes and renal function, with serial serum potassium emphasized because hypokalemia from diuretics may cause fatal arrhythmias and increase digitalis toxicity, whereas hyperkalemia may complicate therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and aldosterone antagonists. Worsening renal function may require dose adjustment of diuretics, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonists, digoxin, and noncardiac medications, and development of hyponatremia or anemia may signal disease progression and is associated with impaired survival. Serum B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels parallel clinical severity as assessed by NYHA class in decompensated populations, are higher in hospitalized patients and tend to decrease during aggressive therapy, but it cannot be assumed that BNP levels can be used effectively as targets for adjustment of therapy in individual patients.

### Randomized controlled trial of urinE chemiStry guided aCute heArt faiLure treATmEnt (ESCALATE): rationale and design [^115thu1G]. American Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Diuresis to achieve decongestion is a central aim of therapy in patients hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). While multiple clinical trials have investigated initial diuretic strategies for a designated period of time, there is a paucity of evidence to guide diuretic titration strategies continued until decongestion is achieved. The use of urine chemistries (urine sodium and creatinine) in a natriuretic response prediction equation accurately estimates natriuresis in response to diuretic dosing, but a randomized clinical trial is needed to compare a urine chemistry-guided diuresis strategy with a strategy of usual care. The urinE chemiStry guided aCute heArt faiLure treATmEnt (ESCALATE) trial is designed to test the hypothesis that protocolized diuretic therapy guided by spot urine chemistry through completion of intravenous diuresis will be superior to usual care and improve outcomes over the 14 days following randomization. ESCALATE will randomize and obtain complete data on 450 patients with acute heart failure to a diuretic strategy guided by urine chemistry or a usual care strategy. Key inclusion criteria include an objective measure of hypervolemia with at least 10 pounds of estimated excess volume, and key exclusion criteria include significant valvular stenosis, hypotension, and a chronic need for dialysis. Our primary outcome is days of benefit over the 14 days after randomization. Days of benefit combines patient symptoms captured by global clinical status with clinical state quantifying the need for hospitalization and intravenous diuresis.

Study Procedures

The GUIDE‐IT trial participants underwent extensive baseline testing and physical examination before simple, unrestricted randomization to respective HF management arms. Subjects were followed up at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and then every 3 months for the remaining study period. Each follow‐up visit entailed the collection of blood for NT‐proBNP assessment locally (in biomarker‐guided arm only) and additional sample collection for centralized NT‐proBNP testing (in both arms) at the biomarker core laboratory in Duke Clinical Research Institute, Durham, NC. 31 The results from core laboratory assessments were not transmitted back to the investigators. The follow‐up visits also involved focused history collection, physical examination, and medication adjustment with the documentation of the rationale behind the adjustments. Although the specific medication adjustments were at the discretion of the treating physicians, prioritization of the neurohormonal antagonist titration was encouraged over diuretics in the absence of volume overload or congestion. 26, 31 The prespecified primary outcome for the GUIDE‐IT trial was the time‐to‐first HF hospitalization or cardiovascular cause of death, which was adjudicated by a blinded clinical events committee. The trial was discontinued by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute–appointed data and safety monitoring board at 81% of planned enrollment after 50% of planned primary end point events had occurred, as the study met the prespecified inefficiency criteria. 26

### Exploring safety of down-titrating diuretics in heart failure management [^113D9Zgy]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Loop diuretics are widely used in heart failure (HF) for symptom relief. Guidelines advise treating patients with the lowest possible dose of loop diuretics to maintain euvolaemia, based on expert opinion only. However, data on the safety of this practice are scarce. This analysis aims to investigate the clinical course after changing loop diuretics in stable HF patients.

Methods and Results

A post-hoc analysis from the TIME-CHF study was conducted in 622 patients. Daily loop diuretic doses were meticulously recorded, resulting in 11035 dose evaluations assessed. The frequency of relevant events within 30days (hospitalization, death, dose change) following an up-titration, down-titration, or no change in diuretic therapy was calculated. Risk of hospitalization and deaths 30days after down-titration was estimated after adjusting for congestion level. At baseline the cohort consisted mostly of males (59%), with a mean age of 77years. Patients were highly symptomatic with 76% classified as New York Heart Association class III or IV. Within 30days after a down-titration, diuretic dose necessitated an increase in 30.4% of cases, compared with 20.7% following up-titration and 8.0% on a stable dose. Hospitalization and death were significantly more frequent following down-titration (3.4% and 2% within 30days, respectively) than with a stable dose (1% and 0.6%, p < 0.001). Similar hospitalization rates were observed after up-titration. The risk of hospitalization doubled and of death tripled after down-titration in patients with similar congestion levels.

Conclusions

There is a significant risk that reduction in diuretic dose requires restart or increase of diuretics within a short period. Additionally, there may be a significant risk associated with diuretic dose reduction. Therefore, HF patients need to be closely monitored after down-titration of loop diuretic therapy.

### Change in renal function associated with drug treatment in heart failure: national guidance [^11771YbR]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) system are cornerstones of the management of patients with heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF). However, RAAS inhibitors may cause decline in renal function and/or hyperkalaemia, particularly during initiation and titration, intercurrent illness and during worsening of heart failure. There is very little evidence from clinical trials to guide the management of renal dysfunction. The Renal Association and British Society for Heart Failure have collaborated to describe the interactions between heart failure, RAAS inhibitors and renal dysfunction and give clear guidance on the use of RAAS inhibitors in patients with HFrEF. During initiation and titration of RAAS inhibitors, testing renal function is mandatory; a decline in renal function of 30% or more can be acceptable. During intercurrent illness, there is no evidence that stopping RAAS inhibitor is beneficial, but if potassium rises above 6.0mmol/L, or creatinine rises more than 30%, RAAS inhibitors should be temporarily withheld. In patients with fluid retention, high doses of diuretic are needed and a decline in renal function is not an indication to reduce diuretic dose: if the patient remains congested, more diuretics are required. If a patient is hypovolaemic, diuretics should be stopped or withheld temporarily. Towards end of life, consider stopping RAAS inhibitors. RAAS inhibition has no known prognostic benefit in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Efforts should be made to initiate, titrate and maintain patients with HFrEF on RAAS inhibitor treatment, whether during intercurrent illness or worsening heart failure.

### Spot urinary sodium as a biomarker of diuretic response in acute heart failure [^114tZ5yB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Overall, cumulative data support the promising role of urine sodium‐based diuretic titration in AHF, but high‐quality evidence and clinical experience remain limited. Prior issues should be clarified in further dedicated studies. We consider spot urinary sodium may be a useful measurement for monitoring and guiding diuretic therapy in patients with true fluid overload. However, further studies in a broad spectrum of patients and clinical situations are required to understand the pros and cons of this parameter. Before we have more evidence, we advocate for using early hospitalization of UNa for monitoring and guiding diuretic approaches as 1 more piece of the puzzle, as stated in the Figure. In addition, we should be aware of some clinical conditions (not overt fluid overload, acute kidney injury, cirrhosis, multiple diuretic therapy) in which the interpretation of urinary sodium excretion may be challenging.

Figure 1
Guided diuretic therapy according to early post‐diuretic spot urinary sodium in acute heart failure.

In AHF, the kidneys shows higher avidity of sodium reabsorption, and consequently low urinary sodium is frequently present and associated with more severe disease. Excluding cirrhotic, in fluid overload patients with AHF, a spot UNa < 50 mEq/L at 2 hours after loop diuretic infusion is associated with worse loop diuretic response (diuretic resistance) using different metrics. Expert consensus recommends early intensification of diuretic therapy in case of low UNa (< 50–70 mEq/L) at 2 hours after the first intravenous loop diuretic administration. We propose a comprehensive interpretation of early UNa after diuretic treatment accounting for other parameters of decongestion, especially in specific cases in which the evidence is scarce and pathophysiology of UNa complex, such as ambiguity about volume overload status, AKI, severe CKD, cirrhotic patients, and use of aquaretics. Equally as ESC guidelines declare and because most studies are observational and use different cutoffs from 50 to 89 mmol, the cutoff used in this figure is based on expert opinion and based in recent released results of the ENACT‐HF study. AHF indicates acute heart failure; AKI, acute kidney injury; CKD, chronic kidney disease; ENACT HF, Efficacy of a Standardized Diuretic Protocol in Acute Heart Failure Study; ESC, European Society of Cardiology; RAAS, renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system; and Una, urinary sodium.

Abstract

Aims

Loop diuretics are widely used in heart failure (HF) for symptom relief. Guidelines advise treating patients with the lowest possible dose of loop diuretics to maintain euvolaemia, based on expert opinion only. However, data on the safety of this practice are scarce. This analysis aims to investigate the clinical course after changing loop diuretics in stable HF patients.

Methods and results

A post‐hoc analysis from the TIME‐CHF study was conducted in 622 patients. Daily loop diuretic doses were meticulously recorded, resulting in 11 035 dose evaluations assessed. The frequency of relevant events within 30 days (hospitalization, death, dose change) following an up‐titration, down‐titration, or no change in diuretic therapy was calculated. Risk of hospitalization and deaths 30 days after down‐titration was estimated after adjusting for congestion level. At baseline the cohort consisted mostly of males (59%), with a mean age of 77 years. Patients were highly symptomatic with 76% classified as New York Heart Association class III or IV. Within 30 days after a down‐titration, diuretic dose necessitated an increase in 30.4% of cases, compared with 20.7% following up‐titration and 8.0% on a stable dose.

Similar hospitalization rates were observed after up‐titration. The risk of hospitalization doubled and of death tripled after down‐titration in patients with similar congestion levels.

Conclusions

There is a significant risk that reduction in diuretic dose requires restart or increase of diuretics within a short period. Additionally, there may be a significant risk associated with diuretic dose reduction. Therefore, HF patients need to be closely monitored after down‐titration of loop diuretic therapy.

Discussion

Our findings show that approximately one‐third of patients require swift reinitiation or an increase of the dose after down‐titration and both hospitalization and mortality were increased. Thus, caution is advisable if down‐titration is intended. Current recommendations by guidelines are mostly based on expert opinion with little scientific evidence. Our data emphasize the need to further investigate this practice and prospectively investigate the true risks and benefits of reducing loop diuretic therapy in HF patients who seem to be clinically stable based on signs and symptoms only.

A recent article by Felker et al.acknowledges the lack of evidence regarding the correct use of diuretic therapy, despite being an important cornerstone of treatment in HF, irrespective of LVEF. Regardless of the lack of robust evidence, the consensus remains that lower dosages or discontinuation of diuretic therapy should be pursued as stated by Magdy et al.for example. This might be supported by a small randomized controlled trial by Rohde et al. They included 188 stable outpatients with little or no symptoms and a maximum stable furosemide dose of 80 mg. Loop diuretic therapy was withdrawn in 95 of them without occurrence of any safety issues and little need for restarting diuretic therapy. However, the patients in our study were more symptomatic and had more severe HF. This may explain the different outcomes of the study by Rohde et al.and our study. Moreover, some of the patients had clinical signs of volume overload, at least during the first months, but the increased risk was independent of clinical assessment.

Step III: Adjust diuretic doses

If the above first measures are not sufficient, HFrEF treatment should then be adjusted.

The first step is to assess the total extracellular volume in order to determine whether it is possible to lower the dose of diuretics. Clinical, biological, or ultrasound (lung and/or cardiac) signs of congestion should be identified, or congestion scores used 13 to attain this goal.

In the absence of congestive signs, 13 diuretics should be carefully decreased and their replacement by an MRA (or MRA up‐titration) can even be considered in some cases. Only a few trials have targeted the decrease in diuretics. 45 A controlled randomized trial has recently been reported and confirmed the feasibility of this approach in stable HFrEF patients. 50, 51 Serial monitoring of stable natriuretic peptide concentrations may be useful during diuretic titration to provide reassurance that congestion is not worsening significantly.

Salt intake should also be assessed. Indeed, low salt intake could participate in low extracellular volume, such that, in some cases, salt intake could be increased cautiously. If significant congestive signs and severe hypotension are present, this should be considered as a state of acute cardiogenic pre‐shock or terminal heart disease. The patient should then be referred promptly to a specialized HF management team (HF Team).

In case of failure or inability to adjust the diuretics, and if hypotension or hypotensive symptoms persist, an adjustment of other HFrEF therapeutic classes should be discussed (Step IV).

Diuresis for hospitalized patients with acute decompensated heart failure is a routine clinical practice but one that remains reliant on error-prone and resource-intensive intake and output and weight measurements and is subject to wide provider variation. We sought to use quality improvement approaches to implement a data-driven predictive diuresis protocol based on natriuresis using the electronic health record to titrate dosing. Our initiative did not result in significant reductions in length of stay but did demonstrate a significant increase in the use of urine studies to guide diuresis and signals toward more aggressive diuretic dosing without an increase in adverse outcomes.

### Continuous hemodynamic monitoring in heart failure [^111MN6BK]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic congestive heart failure is associated with high morbidity and mortality, frequent hospital admissions, and high treatment costs. As the prevalence and incidence of the disease are increasing, there is a clear need to improve the management of heart failure patients. Continuous hemodynamic monitoring with an implanted device is technically feasible and safe. It provides reliable information on central hemodynamic parameters and allows for analysis of long-term hemodynamic trends. It has been suggested that continuous hemodynamic monitoring might improve the management of patients with chronic heart failure. This article describes the technical details of the monitoring system and presents possible clinical applications, with a focus on beta-blocker therapy, diuretics, and volume management. A case is reported, illustrating how hemodynamic long-term trends might add valuable information during up-titration of beta-blockers. Future implications of hemodynamic monitoring are discussed.

Aldosterone antagonists — initiation and monitoring: Spironolactone should be initiated at a dose of 12.5 to 25 mg daily, or occasionally on alternate days, and eplerenone was used at 25 mg per day, increasing to 50 mg daily. Potassium supplementation is generally stopped after initiation, patients should be counseled to avoid high potassium-containing foods, and patients should be cautioned to avoid the addition of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors. Potassium levels and renal function should be rechecked within 3 days and again at 1 week after initiation; subsequent monitoring should occur at least monthly for the first 3 months and every 3 months thereafter, with any addition or increase in angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) triggering a new cycle of monitoring. In view of hyperkalemia risk, the Writing Committee recommends that the routine triple combination of ACEIs, ARBs, and an aldosterone antagonist be avoided. The development of potassium levels in excess of 5.5 mEq per liter should generally trigger discontinuation or dose reduction of the aldosterone antagonist, and patients should be instructed specifically to stop the aldosterone antagonist during an episode of diarrhea or while loop diuretic therapy is interrupted.

Diuretic therapy (Figure 6) — in hospitalized heart failure, initiate IV loop diuretics early (ED or immediately after admission) with an initial dose usually 1–2.5 times total daily oral loop diuretic agent in furosemide equivalents, and prescribe IV diuretics every 8–12 hrs or continuous while measuring daily weights and urine output and monitoring vital signs and congestion; consider addition of SGLT inhibitors for chronic therapy and consider adjunct diuretic agent such as acetazolamide. For Adequate diuresis, continue diuretics with target relief of congestion and plan for transition to oral therapy. For Inadequate diuresis, usually increase loop diuretic agent dose by 50%-100% and consider other thiazides or additional diuretic agents. For Refractory to diuretics, change course by escalating diuretics, considering additional diuretic agents or other decongestion strategies, and consider hemodynamic monitoring to guide therapy.

Methods

The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

Study Protocol

This study protocol complied with the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and received approval from the local institutional review board (ID: 17‐000976). A retrospective cohort study design was used to evaluate patients diagnosed with CS at 3 tertiary academic referral centers within a single health care enterprise located in 3 different states.

Cohort Definition

A query of the internal registry of 848 patients evaluated in our CS clinic (January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2023) was generated to identify those with an established CS diagnosis, HF (with midrange or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF], < 50%) at CS index evaluation, and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) within 90 days and 11 to 36 months of CS index evaluation (performed and interpreted by sonographers and cardiologists at our institution).CS diagnosis was categorized by modified Heart Rhythm Society criteria, including definite CS (histological evidence by endomyocardial biopsy), probable CS (histological extracardiac evidence and supporting clinical/imaging evidence), or presumed/clinical CS (cardiac imaging evidence and compatible arrhythmia; Table S1).

Program

Patients were stratified by their enrollment in the MTM program (MTM versus non‐MTM [NMTM]). Through the MTM program, which was started January 8, 2019, pharmacists conduct independent visits with patients with CS (in person or remote); discuss GDMT tolerance and symptoms; order and review monitoring laboratory studies; address adverse effects; and start, stop, or adjust GDMT via a collaborative practice agreement with the CS cardiologists. GDMT within the MTM scope of practice includes, but is not limited to, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitors (ARNis), β blockers, mineralocorticoid‐receptor antagonists (MRAs), and sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 inhibitors (SGLT‐2i). The collaborative practice agreement also includes ivabradine, digoxin, oral immunosuppressive agents, antimicrobial prophylactic agents, anticoagulants, antihypertensive therapies, diuretics, vasodilators, and antihyperlipidemics. All patients with CS and HF evaluated in our clinic since implementation of the MTM program who were identified by their treating cardiologist as in need of GDMT titration were offered this service.

Clinical trajectories and diuretic management in hospitalized HF — patients who are responding well to diuresis and are hemodynamically stable should have guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) up-titrated as tolerated, aiming to implement all 4 components of GDMT for HFrEF; intravenous (IV) diuretic agents should generally be continued until optimal decongestion is achieved, then patients should transition to the oral dose estimated for maintenance; in the large Optum database, there was a higher rate of early mortality and readmission in the 19% of patients who had IV diuretic agents stopped (for an average of 3 days) and then restarted before discharge; initiation of SGLT inhibitor during hospitalization should prompt reassessment of the diuretic regimen planned for discharge; for nonresponders or those who worsen, invasive monitoring and/or the addition of vasodilators or inotropic therapy may be considered, usually best guided by subspecialty consultation.

### Association of serum potassium time in target range with cardiovascular outcomes in patients with HFpEF [^1173Htm4]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

According to the frequency of potassium monitoring in the TOPCAT trial, we recommended the schedule for sK measurements as follows: first, the sK levels should be measured prior to initiating ACEI/ARB/diuretic therapy; then, they should be monitored again within 1 week of drug administration. For those patients with abnormal potassium levels, repeat measurement within 7 days was recommended. For those patients with stable potassium levels, it is recommended to monitor the potassium levels every 4 weeks and eventually extend to 6-month intervals. In cases involving medication adjustment, potassium monitoring should be carried out within 1 week of the adjustment. To effectively maintain sK levels, interventions for hyperkalaemia include dietary potassium restriction, reduction of RAAS inhibitor usage and the use of newer medications. Potassium binders or dialysis may be required for precise potassium control in specific patients such as those with renal impairment. Conversely, in cases of mild hypokalaemia in patients with HF, it is recommended to increase the dosage of ACEIs/ARBs/angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs) to meet guideline-recommended targets. In patients with persistent fluid overload and more severe hypokalaemia, loop diuretics are preferred to manage congestion, and potassium supplementation may also be considered. Further studies are warranted to determine whether aggressive management of dyskalaemia using potassium supplements for hypokalaemia or potassium binders for hyperkalaemia can reduce mortality in patients with HFpEF. The comprehensive application of these measures helps maintain potassium levels within the target range, ensuring long-term potassium stability and improving overall CV outcomes.

### Principles of management of severe hyponatremia [^1145RSFN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Management Protocol

Table 5 summarizes the management of hyponatremia with saline infusion. Closed system formulas (formulas 2 to 7) provide estimates of the required saline volume and allow comparison between desired and observed changes in [Na] and, therefore, provide the frame for identifying the source of their deviations and the guide for appropriate treatment changes. The first aim of treatment is to avoid undercorrection of hyponatremia. Prescription of the volume of saline infused by formula 4 or 6 is suitable for this purpose. Monitoring is critical when saline is infused, particularly in hypovolemic hyponatremia in which water diuresis, overestimation of initial body water, and initial focusing on volume rather than tonicity issues complicate the treatment. Monitoring, with reduced frequency of [Na] measurement (usually once daily), is essential during treatment of hyponatremia without saline infusion.

Table 5.
Steps of the Management of Severe Hyponatremia

Many tests, especially urine chemistries and osmolality, cannot be obtained rapidly from all hospital laboratories. For this and other reasons, administration, along with saline, of loop diuretics (eg, furosemide) to make urine free water excretion more predictable may be helpful in managing hypovolemic hyponatremia. Although furosemide will initially increase urinary sodium and potassium excretion, it is reasonable to assume that the sum of urine sodium plus potassium concentration is equal to ≈75 mEq/L when a furosemide effect is present, at least until direct laboratory measurements are available. Because patients with hypovolemic hyponatremia have reduced total body sodium and probably water, care must be taken to replace more than the predicted urinary electrolyte and water losses with infused saline.

Vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists may ultimately be extremely useful for treating complicated chronic hyponatremias. However, it is unclear how to best use these new agents at present. It is fair to say that the vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists appear to be very effective in the settings of heart failure, cirrhosis, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion and safe when administered as monotherapy. – Unfortunately, these agents are currently extremely expensive. Moreover, we would stress that these agents should be avoided during saline infusion to prevent the hazards of excessive water diuresis.

### Patient completion of laboratory tests to monitor medication therapy: a mixed-methods study [^1146QEzP]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Little is known about the contribution of patient behavior to incomplete laboratory monitoring, and the reasons for patient non-completion of ordered laboratory tests remain unclear.

Objective

To describe factors, including patient-reported reasons, associated with non-completion of ordered laboratory tests.

Design

Mixed-Methods study including a quantitative assessment of the frequency of patient completion of ordered monitoring tests combined with qualitative, semi-structured, patient interviews.

Participants

Quantitative assessment included patients 18 years or older from a large multispecialty group practice, who were prescribed a medication requiring monitoring. Qualitative interviews included a subset of show and no-show patients prescribed a cardiovascular, anticonvulsant, or thyroid replacement medication.

Main Measures

Proportion of recommended monitoring tests for each medication not completed, factors associated with patient non-completion, and patient-reported reasons for non-completion.

Key Results

Of 27,802 patients who were prescribed one of 34 medications, patient non-completion of ordered tests varied (range: 0–24%, by drug-test pair). Factors associated with higher odds of test non-completion included: younger patient age (< 40 years vs. ≥ 80 years, adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.52, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.27–1.83); lower medication burden (one medication vs. more than one drug, AOR for non-completion 1.26, 95% CI 1.15–1.37), and lower visit frequency (0–5 visits/year vs. ≥ 19 visits/year, AOR 1.41, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.59). Drug-test pairs with black box warning status were associated with greater odds of non-completion, compared to drugs without a black box warning or other guideline for testing (AOR 1.91, 95% CI 1.66–2.19). Qualitative interviews, with 16 no-show and seven show patients, identified forgetting as the main cause of non-completion of ordered tests.

Conclusions

Patient non-completion contributed to missed opportunities to monitor medications, and was associated with younger patient age, lower medication burden and black box warning status. Interventions to improve laboratory monitoring should target patients as well as physicians.

### Remote pulmonary artery pressure-guided management of patients with heart failure: a clinical consensus statement of the heart failure association (HFA) of the ESC [^112pDXJf]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Pre‐implant the patient or caregiver must be trained to take daily readings, emphasizing the clinical importance of these measurements, since patients who will be non‐compliant to the measurement will not benefit from pressure‐guided management. Patients with elevated intravascular volume and increased PAP benefit from increased doses of loop diuretics, combined diuretic therapy, optimization of GDMT and direct vasodilators. Of note, although neurohormonal antagonists are usually titrated based on well‐known titration schemes and target doses are derived from pivotal randomized trials and recommended in guidelines, there are no specific recommendations for titration of diuretics and direct vasodilators in HF, and PAP guidance offers a useful way to tailor these medications. In this regard, although changes in diuretic doses are the most common drug intervention in response to changes in PAP, the addition or titration of direct vasodilators was also part of the treatment algorithm used in randomized trials on PAP‐guided management. However, further studies specifically investigating the optimal algorithms for treatment optimization in response to PAP monitoring are awaited.

After optimizing medical treatment, monitoring should be aimed at maintenance of target diastolic PAP (Table 3). Achieving and maintaining long‐term stability by keeping PAP in the target range on a day‐to‐day basis is the crucial intervention to improve patients' QoL and reduce the risk of HF‐related hospitalizations. Treatment aims to maintain diastolic PAP within normal values, with a usual upper target of 16–20 mmHg and an ideal target range between 8 and 20 mmHg, by adjusting medications, mainly diuretics and GDMT and also vasodilators in some cases. Conversely, persistently low PAP might lead to a dose reduction or discontinuation of diuretic therapy with further reassessment to ensure no rise occurs in the following days. Likely, a part of the success of PAP‐guided optimization of GDMT lies within timely down‐titration of diuretics and other drugs, preventing forward failure and renal dysfunction. The personalized up‐titration or down‐titration of diuretics and/or vasodilators offers additional room for careful titration of HF‐modifying drugs, specifically renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors, beta‐blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, allowing even further optimal titration in vulnerable HF patients.

### Real-world associations between renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition therapy, hyperkalemia, and outcomes: a clinical and scientific call to action [^111r5wu5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical Approach for Monitoring

First, appropriate monitoring of patients at the initiation and shortly after the commencement of therapy with RAASi is critical. Careful monitoring and cautious dose adjustment are absolutely essential to successfully maintain high‐risk patients on maximal RAASi therapy.

Before starting or changing RAASi dose, it is necessary to completely review prescribed (eg, trimethoprim or β‐blockers, both shown to increase serum potassium) and over‐the‐counter medications (such as nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory agents), in addition to assessing intravascular volume status. Having an accurate assessment of the patient's ideal weight is helpful in this regard. Patients significantly lower than their target body weight may already be sodium avid and not provide the distal sodium delivery needed to support potassium excretion. Patients who are significantly greater than their target body weight may have cardiac decompensation, which will reduce renal blood flow, activate the RAAS, and reduce distal sodium delivery. It is important to avoid starting or increasing RAASi dose until patients are optimized with regard to intravascular volume, with stable kidney function, and when other medications that increase serum potassium have been stopped or reduced as much as possible. Clearly starting RAASi in the setting of hyperkalemia is not advisable. Repeat laboratory testing 10 to 14 days after delaying or after starting or changing RAASi dose is important and should include close monitoring once a stable RAASi dose is achieved. The intervals for monitoring should be tailored to the patient's history and comorbidities but at a minimum at least every 4 months.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

5.2.9 Kidney dysfunction/injury — Estimated GFR using serum creatinine should be measured 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose titration of antihypertensive medications. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor (RAASi) (including ACEi, ARB, and MRA) lead to an expected reduction, or dip, in eGFR of up to 30% via vasodilation of efferent arterioles, and this expected short-term dip in eGFR is associated with preservation of kidney function in the long-term and should not lead to discontinuation of the RAASi unless the decline in eGFR is persistently > 30%. A referral to a nephrologist is appropriate for evaluation for other causes of AKI, CKD progression, and possible renal artery stenosis. The presence of new kidney dysfunction/injury may also be observed with the addition or dose increase of diuretics; this should prompt evaluation of volume status to rule out hypovolemia and other possible causes of kidney dysfunction, and it may be appropriate to initially hold or reduce the diuretic dose and then advance more slowly.

### Assessment of patiromer monotherapy for hyperkalemia in an acute care setting [^112McLuk]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has limitations. First, the study did not have a control group; therefore, whether observed reductions in potassium levels were associated with patiromer alone could not be determined. Nevertheless, we took care to exclude instances of coadministration with other potassium-lowering agents, including insulin, furosemide, albuterol, and other potassium binders. Furthermore, the intent of our study was to evaluate outcomes associated with patiromer administration in a real-world clinical setting and to quantify the potassium level reduction associated with this agent. In addition, the absence of a protocol for treatment and monitoring of hyperkalemia required us to exclude observations from our analysis in each time interval if a laboratory blood sample was not obtained. Whereas this may have influenced the overall potassium-lowering estimates (eg, patients with higher baseline potassium levels may have been more likely to receive earlier or more frequent monitoring), we evaluated potassium level reduction in both absolute and relative terms as well as stratified by baseline potassium levels, which provided findings consistent with the overall end points.

Our analysis of the clinical practice context indicated wide variability and inconsistent follow-up monitoring. Further research should explore implementation of protocols for treatment, including novel potassium binders, for non–life-threatening hyperkalemia in an acute care setting.

### Clinical practice guideline: maintenance intravenous fluids in children [^112puCGw]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Biochemical laboratory monitoring and dysnatremia risk during maintenance intravenous fluids (IVFs): Researchers in most studies obtained serial plasma sodium values, with the first plasma sodium being measured between 6 hours and 12 hours, and in patients receiving isotonic fluids the incidence of hyponatremia ranged from 0% to 23%. Clinicians should be aware that even patients receiving isotonic maintenance IVFs are at sufficient risk for developing hyponatremia and, if isotonic IVF recipients develop hyponatremia, they should be evaluated to determine if they are receiving other sources of free water or if they may have SIAD and/or an adrenal insufficiency. If hypernatremia develops (plasma sodium > 144 mEq/L), patients should be evaluated for renal dysfunction or extrarenal free-water losses. In patients at high risk for developing electrolyte abnormalities, such as those who have undergone major surgery, those in the ICU, or those with large gastrointestinal losses or receiving diuretics, frequent laboratory monitoring may be necessary, and if neurologic symptoms that could be consistent with hyponatremic encephalopathy are present, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, headache, confusion, or lethargy, electrolytes should be measured.

### Gepirone (Exxua) [^116gZVQ6]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Recommendations Prior to Initiating and During Treatment with EXXUA

Electrocardiogram and Electrolyte Monitoring

Correct electrolyte abnormalities prior to initiating EXXUA. In patients with electrolyte abnormalities, or who are receiving diuretics or glucocorticoids, or who have a history of hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, also monitor electrolytes during dose titration and periodically during treatment with EXXUA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Perform an electrocardiogram (ECG) prior to initiating EXXUA, during dosage titration, and periodically during treatment.
Do not initiate EXXUA if QTc is > 450 msec at baseline.
Monitor ECGs more frequently if EXXUA is used:
concomitantly with drugs known to prolong the QT interval
in patients who develop QTc ≥ 450 msec during treatment
in patients with a significant risk of developing torsade de pointes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7)].
Do not escalate the EXXUA dosage if the QTcF is > 450 msec [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Bipolar Disorder, Mania, and Hypomania Screening

Screen patients for a personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania prior to initiating treatment with EXXUA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

2.2 Important Administration Instructions

Take EXXUA orally with food at approximately the same time each day [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Swallow tablets whole. Do not split, crush, or chew EXXUA.

2.3 Recommended Dosage

The recommended starting dosage of EXXUA is 18.2 mg once daily. Based on clinical response and tolerability, the dosage may be increased to 36.3 mg orally once daily on Day 4 and further titrated to 54.5 mg orally once daily after Day 7 and to 72.6 mg orally once daily after an additional week. The maximum recommended daily dosage of EXXUA is 72.6 mg once daily.

2.4 Recommended Dosage in Geriatric Patients

The recommended starting dosage of EXXUA in geriatric patients is 18.2 mg orally once daily. Based on clinical response and tolerability, the dosage may be increased to maximum recommended dosage of 36.3 mg orally once daily after Day 7 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Laboratory monitoring of drugs at initiation of therapy in ambulatory care [^116aWMYx]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Product labeling and published guidelines reflect the importance of monitoring laboratory parameters for drugs with a risk of organ system toxicity or electrolyte imbalance. Limited information exists about adherence to laboratory monitoring recommendations. The objective of this study was to describe laboratory monitoring among ambulatory patients dispensed medications for which laboratory testing is recommended at therapy initiation.

Design and Subjects

We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of patients in 10 geographically distributed health maintenance organizations who were newly prescribed medications with recommended laboratory test monitoring. The main outcome measure was the proportion of initial drug dispensing without recommended baseline laboratory monitoring for 35 newly initiated drugs or drug classes.

Results

One hundred seven thousand, seven hundred sixty-three of 279,354 (39%) initial drug dispensings occurred without recommended laboratory monitoring. Patients without monitoring were younger than patients who had monitoring (median 57 vs 61 years, P < .001). Thirty-two percent of dispensings where a serum creatinine was indicated did not have it evaluated (range across drugs, 12% to 61%); 39% did not have liver function testing (range 10% to 75%); 32% did not have hematologic monitoring (range 9% to 51%); and 34% did not have electrolyte monitoring (range 20% to 62%) (P < .001).

Conclusions

Substantial opportunity exists to improve laboratory monitoring of drugs for which such monitoring is recommended. This study emphasizes the need for research to identify the clinical implications of not conducting recommended laboratory monitoring, existing barriers to monitoring, and methods to improve practice.

### Revisiting resistant hypertension in kidney disease [^114PbFGh]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Blockade of multiple nephron segments to intensify diuresis has been increasingly recognized as a treatment option in excess sodium retention states. In a pilot study, combination of furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide in stage 4 and 5 CKD increased the fractional excretion of sodium and decreased the mean BP more efficiently compared to each agent alone. PATHWAY-2 trial evaluated such strategy in patients with resistant hypertension combining spironolactone as fourth-line agent to the regimen of diuretic, angiotensin-converting enzymes/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEi/ARB), and calcium channel blocker. Spironolactone reduced home SBP by 8.70 mmHg and titration from 25 to 50 mg daily showed additional BP reduction. The combined diuretics have not been evaluated specifically in patients with resistant hypertension associated with CKD, mostly due to concern of electrolyte imbalances and worsening kidney function; nonetheless, can be considered with careful monitoring and use of potassium binding resin if hyperkalaemia occurs.

On many occasions, absence of oedema and/or rise in creatinine as BP improves, raise suspicion of the above approach among treating physicians. In these cases, clinically available volume assessment tools such as blood volume analysis, point-of-care ultrasonography, bioimpedance analysis, or crit line (for haemodialysis patients) can be used to determine the appropriate diuretic regimen and titration strategies. The discussion about these tools is beyond the scope of this review; overall, use of these have been shown to improve hypertension control, although there is lack of data in patients with resistant hypertension associated with CKD. Acute decline in renal function occurs frequently due to reversible hemodynamic alterations or rapid decrease in BP, more in setting of RAAS inhibition. This acute decline in renal function during intensive BP lowering in most circumstance does not mediate or associate with long-term risk. In these circumstances, clinicians should evaluate for other reasons and the degree of the drop in GFR. In the absence of other reasons and drop in GFR within acceptable range explained by hemodynamic alterations (usually 20–30%), patients can be monitored safely.

### Furosemide (toxicology medicated collection system) [^112bkMpV]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertension

Therapy should be individualized according to the patient's response to gain maximal therapeutic response and to determine the minimal dose needed to maintain the therapeutic response.

Adults

The usual initial dose of Furosemide tablets for hypertension is 80 mg, usually divided into 40 mg twice a day. Dosage should then be adjusted according to response. If response is not satisfactory, add other antihypertensive agents.

Changes in blood pressure must be carefully monitored when Furosemide tablets are used with other antihypertensive drugs, especially during initial therapy. To prevent excessive drop in blood pressure, the dosage of other agents should be reduced by at least 50 percent when Furosemide tablets are added to the regimen. As the blood pressure falls under the potentiating effect of Furosemide tablets, a further reduction in dosage or even discontinuation of other antihypertensive drugs may be necessary.

Geriatric patients

In general, dose selection and dose adjustment for the elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).

### Efficacy and tolerability of finerenone according to the use and dosage of diuretics: a prespecified analysis of the FINEARTS-HF randomized clinical trial [^113yd5Av]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Although central to treating congestion in heart failure (HF), diuretics have undesirable effects, including neuroendocrine activation and hypokalemia. Overdiuresis can also cause hypovolemia and kidney dysfunction. Moreover, higher diuretic doses have been linked to worse outcomes in HF. Although this is probably because a higher diuretic dose is a marker of HF severity, guidelines recommend using the minimum dose needed to maintain dry weight. Judicious dosing is therefore critical with careful monitoring of blood chemistry. Dose adjustment may also be needed when conventional diuretics are combined with other drugs enhancing sodium and water excretion, which may have a so-called diuretic-sparing effect, enabling dose reduction or avoiding escalation due to worsening congestion. Specifically, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) act as potassium-sparing diuretics by antagonizing the effects of aldosterone, thereby inhibiting epithelial sodium channels (ENaC), reducing sodium reabsorption, and decreasing potassium excretion. This mechanism differs from that of loop and thiazide diuretics, and we hypothesized that combination of finerenone with these diuretics may allow for a reduced loop diuretic requirement.

The new nonsteroidal MRA finerenone is the most recent treatment shown to be of benefit in patients with heart failure and mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction (HFmrEF/HFpEF) in the FINEARTS-HF (Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients With Heart Failure) randomized clinical trial.

Because finerenone has effects on sodium, potassium, and water excretion, the aim of this prespecified analysis of FINEARTS-HF was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of finerenone in relation to background diuretic therapy, including effects on biomarkers reflecting volume status and kidney function. We hypothesized that finereneone would have a diuretic-sparing effect in patients with HFmrEF/HFpEF.

### Continuous versus bolus intermittent loop diuretic infusion in acutely decompensated heart failure: a prospective randomized trial [^1178zu3L]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Supplementary treatment was left to the discretion of the treating physician. All patients took angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and nitrates. No thiazide diuretics, nesiritide, or arginine vasopressin antagonists were administered during the hospitalization period. Hypertonic saline solution was administered to the patients who developed hyponatremia (serum Na values < 128 mEq/L) during treatment with the goal of restoring plasma sodium values up to 134 mEq/L. For this reason Na concentration was monitored each day during the infusion period. The hypertonic saline solution consisted of 20 mEq of NaCl in 500 mL saline solutions (0.9% of NaCl). Infusion was administered at 80 cc/h once or twice a day, depending on the Na value. Dopamine infusions were administered to patients with systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg with the goal of restoring systolic values up to 100 mmHg maintaining diuretic infusion. Inotrope therapy was stopped when blood pressure values were sustained at approximately 105 mmHg during 12 sequential hours for four consecutive measurements.

The frequency of laboratory tests to evaluate electrolyte balance and renal function during hospitalization was at the discretion of the attending physician but was guided by a dose-escalation algorithm. This trial was approved by our hospital's Institutional Review Board of Siena and all patients gave their signed informed consent. This trial was registered and regularly updated in ClinicalTrials.gov with Identifier number: NCT01441245.

Inclusion criteria

Patients over age 18 years of age were screened if they met diagnostic criteria for ADHF due to systolic dysfunction and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 45% by exhibiting at least one of the following symptoms at rest: dyspnea, orthopnea, peripheral edema or major fatigue and at least two clinical signs including rales, pulmonary congestion on chest radiography, jugular vein dilatation, or a third heart sound. Elevations in blood BNP > 400 pg/mL were considered supportive for a diagnosis of ADHF.

Exclusion criteria

Patients were excluded if they had received more than two IV doses of furosemide or any continuous infusion of furosemide one month before randomization, if they had end-stage renal disease or the need for renal replacement therapy (dialysis or ultrafiltration), isolated diastolic dysfunction with LVEF > 45% or recent myocardial infarction within thirty days of screening. Patients with a systolic blood pressure < 80 mm Hg or with serum creatinine levels > 4.0 mg/dL were also excluded, as well as patients who received recent intravenous iodinated contrast.

### A randomized trial assessing efficacy and safety of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy compared to standard antihypertensive therapy in hypErtension with low renin (REMASTER): rationale and study design [^1168B51g]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Trial procedure

Study participants meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 via REDCap to either MRA, spironolactone (intervention), or standard care, perindopril ± amlodipine (control), using a block randomization method. The schedule has been prepared by a biostatistician and uploaded to REDCap and is not available to the clinic staff. Participants on antihypertensive treatment at baseline will undergo a washout period of 2–4 weeks before screening and randomization. If there are clinical concerns, prazosin, a short-acting antihypertensive can be continued until 48 h pre-randomization. The standard care group will receive treatment as per local prescribing patterns and hypertension guidelines. Antihypertensive medications will be titrated as required at 12-weekly intervals until target blood pressure of < 140/90 mmHg is achieved in both groups and renin is unsuppressed i.e. > 15 mU/L in the MRA group (Fig. 1). The biochemical titration target for the MRA group is based on evidence that treatment adequacy is associated with normalized renin. Participants will be reviewed every 6–12 weeks and treated for a total of 48 weeks. Administration of medication will be standardized to night-time dosing once daily for consistency. Blood pressure measurements will be taken seated in triplicates using an automated blood pressure machine (Omron) and the average of 2nd and 3rd readings will be calculated. Automated office blood pressure measurement has been shown to correlate with out-of-clinic measures.

Fig. 1
Titration steps in the treatment algorithm.

Pathology will be collected at Monash Health Pathology laboratories. Both aldosterone and direct renin concentration will be measured using chemiluminescent immunoassays (LIAISON, DiaSorin). For the seated saline suppression test, aldosterone concentration will be measured using mass spectrometry as well due to its greater accuracy. Primary aldosteronism will be excluded if aldosterone concentration post saline infusion is < 162 pmol/L.

Compliance

Medication compliance will be assessed at each study visit using medication diaries and pill counting when medications are returned to the pharmacy.

Relevant concomitant therapies allowed and excluded

Women of childbearing age will need to be on effective contraception given the potential for teratogenicity of the trial medications during study participation and until 2 months after the last dose of trial medications. Trial participants needing to use medications that can interfere with the measurement of blood pressure, renin, or aldosterone during the treatment and follow-up phase of the trial will be excluded.

### Routine laboratory testing in hemodialysis: how frequently is it needed? [^1121eF1E]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Several studies tried to determine the best frequency of laboratory sampling in hemodialysis patients in order to maintain patients' parameters within guidelines' targets. Gaweda et al. measured Hb weekly for a better anemia management. On the other hand, Greenberg et al. showed that patients monitored monthly instead of quarterly for PTH reached better KDOQI target PTH values. However, Yokoyama et al. found no benefit in a more frequent measurement when serum calcium, phosphate and PTH were in their target values. Most recently, a Canadian study by Silver et al. revealed that blood testing every six weeks instead of every four weeks was sufficient and was not associated with a change in anemia and mineral bone disease targets.

There is uncertainty whether the costly regular tests often lead to a change in the decision-making of nephrologists. Our study aims to find out the yearly number of interventions/changes in prescription based on these tests and to depict the specific group of patients who would benefit from reduced testing.
