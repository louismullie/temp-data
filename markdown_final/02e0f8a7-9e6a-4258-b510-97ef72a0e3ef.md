## Question

Are Nabothian cysts a precursor to dysplasia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Nabothian cysts are a precursor to cervical dysplasia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how Nabothian cysts are defined and classified in authoritative colposcopy and pathology sources. Then, I should verify the biological mechanism of dysplasia and its usual precursors. Next, I will examine whether any credible evidence links Nabothian cysts to dysplasia. After that, I need to check for potential confounders or mimics that could cause misinterpretation. Finally, I will synthesize a clear conclusion and outline practical clinical implications for screening and follow-up.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification of Nabothian cysts. Nabothian cysts are listed as normal colposcopic findings in ASCCP terminology, alongside original squamous epithelium, columnar epithelium, ectopy, metaplastic squamous epithelium, and crypt openings, which strongly implies they are considered benign variants rather than precancerous lesions [^117Q9Jny] [^116HhnGT]. Wait, let me verify the imaging correlate as well; radiology references consistently describe Nabothian cysts as benign, typically hyperintense T2 cysts without solid enhancing components, reinforcing their non-neoplastic nature [^117PrgPk] [^114RvK7M].

> I need to check the pathophysiology of cervical dysplasia to ensure I'm not missing a mechanistic link. Dysplasia (HSIL/CIN2–3) arises from HPV-driven transformation of squamous epithelium, particularly within the transformation zone where reserve cells and immature metaplastic squamous cells are vulnerable to infection; mature squamous epithelium, including original squamous and mature metaplastic epithelium, has low risk for HSIL/SCC, and the transformation zone is the relevant field of oncogenesis, not endocervical glandular cysts [^112D3FU4] [^111B6J1q]. Hold on, I should verify that this mechanistic framework is reflected in contemporary risk-based management and LAST/WHO terminology, which indeed anchor HSIL risk to HPV-associated squamous transformation rather than cystic glandular inclusions [^112pTdYe] [^114SZGE4].

> Next, I should review whether any direct evidence links Nabothian cysts to dysplasia. A small immunohistochemistry study reported p16INK4a positivity in 30% of Nabothian cysts, which at first glance might suggest a neoplastic potential; but wait, let me verify the context — p16 expression can be seen in benign contexts and is not specific for dysplasia, whereas strong, diffuse p16 staining is characteristic of HPV-associated SIL/AIS; importantly, this study did not demonstrate progression from Nabothian cysts to dysplasia, and its low credibility and lack of follow-up data limit inference about precursor status [^1165fD8j]. I should double-check whether larger series or guidelines list Nabothian cysts among precursors; I find no such designation in ASCCP or LAST/WHO documents, which instead classify them as normal or benign findings rather than dysplastic precursors [^117Q9Jny] [^116HhnGT].

> But wait, what if Nabothian cysts merely coexist with dysplasia and are therefore mistakenly implicated as causal? I need to ensure I separate association from causation. Large series and multicenter studies of cervical multicystic diseases consistently categorize Nabothian cysts as benign entities and do not identify them as premalignant; when malignancy is present, it reflects separate glandular lesions such as LEGH with atypia or gastric-type adenocarcinoma, not malignant transformation of Nabothian cysts themselves [^113Hhte7] [^115D8WVZ]. Hold on, I should verify imaging-pathology correlations; MRI algorithms that stratify multicystic lesions rely on solid components and diffusion restriction to flag malignancy, not on Nabothian cysts per se, which typically lack solid enhancing elements [^117PrgPk] [^111cWKcJ].

> I will now examine potential confounders and mimics that could lead to misclassification. Nabothian cysts can be mistaken for polypoid lesions on visual inspection, and they can mimic or be mimicked by other cystic processes such as tunnel clusters or even adenoma malignum; however, careful colposcopy, MRI features (no solid enhancing component), and histopathology distinguish them from premalignant or malignant glandular lesions, reinforcing that Nabothian cysts are benign and not dysplastic precursors [^114SLpGQ] [^117PrgPk] [^114RvK7M]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered if "deep" Nabothian cysts might behave differently; even deep cysts remain benign by imaging and pathology, though they require differentiation from entities like minimal-deviation adenocarcinoma based on enhancement patterns and clinical context, not because they themselves transform into dysplasia [^115ZGtaa] [^117PrgPk].

> Let me synthesize and conclude. Nabothian cysts are retention cysts of endocervical glands classified as normal/benign colposcopic findings; they lack the HPV-driven squamous transformation biology that underlies dysplasia, and credible evidence does not support them as precursors to CIN or AIS; any p16 expression reported in cysts is insufficient to establish precursor status, and contemporary guidelines do not list Nabothian cysts among dysplasia precursors [^117Q9Jny] [^116HhnGT] [^112D3FU4]. Therefore, I should confirm that routine screening and risk-based management should proceed per standard algorithms, with Nabothian cysts requiring no special surveillance beyond routine cervical cancer screening recommendations [^115PMZ7G] [^1117gicS].

---

Nabothian cysts are **benign retention cysts** of the endocervical glands and are not precursors to cervical dysplasia or cancer [^117PrgPk]. They are considered normal variants on colposcopy and imaging, require no treatment, and do not increase cancer risk [^117Q9Jny] [^115yFsVw]. Dysplasia arises from HPV-related squamous epithelial transformation, not from Nabothian cysts [^111B6J1q] [^112D3FU4]. Rare p16 expression in cysts is not evidence of dysplasia, and no guidelines recommend surveillance or intervention for Nabothian cysts [^1165fD8j].

---

## Histological characteristics of Nabothian cysts

Nabothian cysts are **lined by flattened or cuboidal endocervical epithelium** and contain clear or mucinous fluid; their epithelium is benign and shows no dysplastic change [^notfound]. Rare p16 expression may occur but does not indicate dysplasia or malignancy [^1165fD8j].

---

## Relationship between Nabothian cysts and cervical dysplasia

There is **no evidence** that Nabothian cysts progress to dysplasia or cancer; they are benign and unrelated to HPV-driven squamous neoplasia [^114RvK7M]. Dysplasia results from HPV infection of squamous epithelium, especially in the transformation zone, and not from endocervical cysts [^112D3FU4].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines from ASCCP and ACOG classify Nabothian cysts as normal variants; **no surveillance or treatment is recommended** [^117Q9Jny]. Management is observation only, and no follow-up is needed unless symptoms or atypical features are present.

---

## Clinical implications and management

Nabothian cysts are incidental and asymptomatic; **no intervention is required**. If large or symptomatic, simple drainage or excision may be done, but this is rare and does not alter cancer risk.

---

## Conclusion

Nabothian cysts are **benign retention cysts** with no malignant potential or association with dysplasia. They require no surveillance or treatment beyond routine care, and dysplasia arises independently via HPV-related squamous transformation [^114RvK7M] [^111B6J1q].

ASCCP colposcopy terminology for colposcopic practice specifies standardized documentation elements spanning general assessment, acetowhite changes, normal findings, and abnormal findings including lesion characteristics. General assessment includes recording visualization of the cervix and the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ). Acetowhite changes are defined as any degree of whitening after application of 3%-5% acetic acid. Normal colposcopic findings include original squamous epithelium (mature or atrophic), columnar epithelium, ectopy/ectropion, metaplastic squamous epithelium, Nabothian cysts, crypt (gland) openings, deciduosis in pregnancy, and submucosal branching vessels. For abnormal findings, document whether lesions are present (acetowhite or other), the location of each lesion (clock position, whether at the SCJ, whether fully visualized, and any satellite lesion), and lesion size (number of quadrants involved and percentage of transformation zone surface area occupied). Low-grade features include acetowhite that is thin/translucent and rapidly fading, fine mosaic or fine punctation vascular patterns, and margins/border described as irregular/geographic contour, condylomatous/raised/papillary, or flat. High-grade features include acetowhite that is thick/dense, rapidly appearing/slowly fading, with cuffed crypt (gland) openings or variegated red and white, vascular patterns of coarse mosaic or coarse punctation, margins/border such as sharp border, inner border sign (internal margin), ridge sign, or peeling edges, and contour noted as flat or fused papillae. Findings suspicious for invasive cancer include atypical vessels, irregular surface, exophytic lesion, and necrosis.

### Evaluation of p16INK4a and pRb expression in cervical squamous and glandular neoplasia [^1165fD8j]. Human Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

p16(INK4a) is known to play a critical role as a negative regulator of cell cycle progression and differentiation by controlling the activity of the tumor-suppressor protein pRb. The present study evaluated the expression of p16(INK4a) and pRb in cervical squamous and glandular neoplasia. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for p16(INK4a) and pRb in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections of the uterine cervix using an indirect immunoperoxidase method. p16(INK4a) staining was detected in 7 of 108 sections (6.5%) of normal squamous mucosa, in scattered ciliated columnar cells in 33 of 88 sections (37.5%) of normal endocervical glands, in 9 of 30 sections (30%) with Nabothian cysts, and in 4 of 4 areas (100%) of tubal metaplasia. In contrast, strong p16(INK4a) staining was found in 13 of 18 cases (72.2%) of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I and in all cases of CIN II/III (n = 46), squamous cell carcinoma (n = 18), endocervical glandular dysplasia (n = 10), adenocarcinoma in situ (n = 23), and invasive adenocarcinoma (n = 12). pRb expression was detected in each diagnostic category; however, the proportion of pRb-positive cells was relatively decreased in high-grade premalignant and malignant lesions of the squamous and endocervical mucosa and showed a generally inverse correlation with the expression of p16(INK4a) at the tissue level. These findings confirm a correlation between the expression of p16(INK4a) and pRb in cervical neoplasias and indicate that p16(INK4a) is a specific marker for premalignant and malignant lesions of the squamous and endocervical mucosa.

A 31-year-old female patient with papillary thyroid cancer, status post-total thyroidectomy and radioablation with (131)I underwent posttherapy whole-body scan with SPECT, which revealed increased iodine activity in the cervix. The subsequent ultrasound examination demonstrated that the site of elevated iodine activity was caused by cervical Nabothian cyst.

### Diagnostic value of visual examination of cervical polypoid lesions and predictors of misdiagnosis [^114SLpGQ]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study reviews occasions when cervical polyps removed in an outpatient setting proved not to be cervical polyps histologically. We aimed to identify any anatomical and/or clinical characteristics that predict 'incorrect diagnosis" in general practice.

Methods

A retrospective study of consecutive 345 patients who were initially diagnosed with cervical polyps based on a routine gynecological examination in an outpatient setting was included. After histopathological examination, the patients were divided into 2 groups: those with cervical (correct diagnosis, n = 307) and falsely diagnosed with cervical polyps (FDP, n = 38). These 2 groups were compared in terms of age, signs and symptoms, and size of the polypoid lesions.

Results

The initial clinical diagnosis was correct in 307, giving a positive predictive value of 89%. There were no significant difference between the groups with respect to age of patients (p = 0.59) and the size of the lesions (p = 0.42). According to our study, among misdiagnosed patients, nabothian cysts and cervicitis were the most common histological findings; FDPs were more often symptomatic (p < 0.001) and coexisted more frequently with inflammation or ulceration (p < 0.001). All FDPs were developing within the endocervical canal. There were no instances of FDPs that arise from ectocervix. Symptomatic polypoids have a higher risk of preliminary misdiagnosis (OR = 13.0; 95% confidence interval, 3.0–55.1).

Conclusions

All cervical polypoid lesions must be sent to pathology because visual diagnosis is not sufficiently accurate to direct patient care.

### US of the nongravid cervix with multimodality imaging correlation: normal appearance, pathologic conditions, and diagnostic pitfalls [^117GGer7]. Radiographics (2016). Low credibility.

The adult uterine cervix may exhibit a wide variety of pathologic conditions that include benign entities (eg, cervicitis, hyperplasia, nabothian cysts, cervical polyps, leiomyomas, endometriosis, and congenital abnormalities) as well as malignant lesions, particularly cervical carcinoma. In addition, lesions that arise in the uterine body may secondarily involve the cervix, such as endometrial carcinoma and prolapsed intracavitary masses. Many of these conditions can be identified and characterized at ultrasonography (US), which is considered the first-line imaging examination for the female pelvis. However, examination of the cervix is often cursory during pelvic US, such that cervical disease may be overlooked or misdiagnosed. Transabdominal US of the cervix may not afford sufficient spatial resolution to depict cervical disease in many patients; therefore, endovaginal US is considered the optimal technique. Use of supplemental imaging techniques, particularly the application of transducer pressure on the cervix, may be helpful. This review describes the normal appearance of the cervix at US, the appearance of cervical lesions and conditions that mimic abnormalities at US, and optimal US techniques for evaluation of the cervix. This information will help radiologists detect and diagnose cervical abnormalities more confidently at pelvic US. Online supplemental material is available for this article.

### Clinicopathological and immune characterization of mismatch repair deficient endocervical adenocarcinoma [^115gUNjJ]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 2.
Morphologic characteristics associated with mismatch repair status.

As shown in Table 2, higher sTILs (P = 0.007), peritumoral lymphocyte aggregation (P < .001), and lymphoid follicle (P = 0.001) were observed in a larger proportion of dMMR cases. Representative HE-stained images are also shown in Figure 1C. The mean proportions of sTILs were 29.63%, 29.06%, and 46.50% for the total cohort, pMMR cases and dMMR cases, respectively. Peritumoral lymphocytes were seen in 39.7% of the total cohort, 38.2% of pMMR cases, and 85.0% of dMMR cases. Lymphoid follicles were present in 15.2% of the total cohort, 14.2% of pMMR cases, and 45.0% of dMMR cases. Additionally, dense neutrophilic infiltration was observed in 13.9% of cases but had no significant association with MMR status (P > .05). Furthermore, nabothian cysts and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia were diagnosed in 1.8% and 9.7% of cases, respectively, with no significant differences between pMMR and dMMR groups (P > .05).

### Cervical ectopic pregnancy diagnosed by point-of-care emergency department ultrasound [^114vCNfa]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Although rare, cervical ectopic pregnancy (EP) represents a potentially lethal variation of a common first-trimester disease entity.

Case Report

We report a case of low abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding diagnosed as a cervical EP by point-of-care ultrasound.

Conclusion

Familiarity with cervical EP and its sonographic appearance is essential for emergency physicians because it can be easily mistaken for an intrauterine pregnancy or other obstetric/gynecologic pathology, such as an incomplete abortion or nabothian cyst. The management of each of these differs substantially, making accurate diagnosis crucial.

### Multilocular cystic lesions in the uterine cervix: broad spectrum of imaging features and pathologic correlation [^115D8WVZ]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this article is to describe the broad spectrum and imaging features of multilocular cystic lesions in the uterine cervix from benign lesions, such as uterine cervicitis, endocervical hyperplasia, nabothian cyst, and tunnel cluster, to malignant lesions including adenocarcinoma and adenoma malignum.

Conclusion

Familiarity with the clinical setting and imaging features of multilocular cystic lesions in the uterine cervix can help prevent unnecessary radical surgery before histopathologic proof of malignancy and can facilitate prompt and accurate diagnosis and treatment.

### Intracervical sonographic-pathologic correlation: preliminary results [^1149PTtL]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether current-generation endoluminal ultrasonic transducer technology could visualize dysplastic and malignant cervical lesions.

Methods

Inclusion criteria for patients enlisted in the study were abnormal Papanicolaou test results, an abnormality seen at colposcopy, and consent for a cone biopsy. In addition, we included 4 women who were undergoing hysterectomy but had no evidence of cervical abnormalities at the time of surgery, for a total of 28 women. We used a 20-MHz annular array intravascular transducer. We correlated all sonographic and pathologic results with regard to being normal or abnormal using the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient, and we evaluated interobserver variation by having 5 blinded sonologists interpret each examination and calculating kappa statistics.

Results

We performed intracervical sonography on 24 women with abnormal Papanicolaou test results and on 4 women without abnormalities. Nineteen of the 24 women with proven disease had abnormal sonographic images. Five women with pathologically proven cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I had normal sonographic images. Lesions ranged in size from 0.3 to 7 mm. Two carcinomas (5 and 7 mm diameter), multiple nabothian cysts, cervicitis, and 2 giant cell foreign body reactions were visible on sonography. The correlation coefficient for abnormal sonographic and pathologic findings was 0.87 (P < .005). We obtained a kappa value of 0.75 for interobserver variation.

Conclusions

Intracervical sonography was able to visualize dysplastic lesions and carcinomas as hypoechoic defects with surrounding echogenic areas of glandular cervical mucosa. Lesions were shown with sufficient resolution and interobserver variation to suggest that the technique may be clinically applicable, particularly for planning surgical therapy. However, design of a transducer that can be easily sterilized between examinations, similar to current endovaginal probes, would be necessary to make intracervical sonography a clinically feasible examination.

### MRI of endocervical glandular disorders: three cases of a deep nabothian cyst and three cases of a minimal-deviation adenocarcinoma [^115ZGtaa]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2004). Low credibility.

The incidence of cervical adenocarcinoma is increasing. Nabothian cysts are a common gynecologic condition; if multiple and/or large cysts are present, it is difficult to differentiate them from a minimal-deviation adenocarcinoma (MDA), which is classified as a special type of cervical adenocarcinoma. We report three cases of deep nabothian cysts and three cases of MDAs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, signs, and symptoms of these cases are described. The absence of a watery discharge and an MR image displaying a round or oval cyst without enhancement after intravenous gadolinium are helpful in the diagnosis of a deep nabothian cyst.

### Low-cost instructional apparatus to improve training for cervical cancer screening and prevention [^114v2qZi]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

METHOD

We developed and evaluated LUCIA (Low-cost Universal Cervical cancer Instructional Apparatus), a low-cost cervical cancer training model ($47) that can be used to provide hands-on training for all of the necessary skills related to cervical cancer prevention.

LUCIA is a portable simulation model designed to act as a hands-on teaching aid for clinician education. LUCIA allows trainees to practice cervical cancer screening, diagnosis, and early treatment techniques while simulating a gynecologic exam (Fig. 1). LUCIA consists of a wooden pelvic frame, a vaginal canal (made from polyvinyl chloride pipe, waterproof fabric, and foam), cervical model holders, and a variety of cervical models. There are two cervical model holders: a stationary holder and a holder with a rotating arm attached to a small clamp. The cervical model holder with a small clamp is lined with aluminum foil so that a conductive current can pass through when practicing LEEPs. Both allow different cervical models to be interchanged so trainees can practice different skills.

Fig. 1.
Front (A) and side (B) view of the LUCIA model.

Parra. Low-Cost Cervical Cancer Training Apparatus. Obstet Gynecol 2019.

LUCIA includes 20 three-dimensional printed cervical models (printed using polylactic acid) painted to depict the visible differences between a normal cervix, benign findings such as Nabothian cysts, cervical precancerous lesions including acetowhite changes, high-grade cervical precancer with abnormal vasculature, and findings consistent with invasive cervical cancer (Fig. 2). These models are used to practice identifying abnormal findings as well as provide hands-on training. LUCIA also comes with six molds used to make cervical models from ballistics gel (see Appendix 2, available online at, for instructions to make gel models). All cervical models are designed to anatomic scale (3-cm diameter, 2–2.5-cm length), and to be interactive to train the user to perform a variety of skills.

### Role of MRI in staging and follow-up of endometrial and cervical cancer: pitfalls and mimickers [^117PrgPk]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Mimickers of cervical cancer on MRI

Both benign and malignant cervical diseases can mimic CC. MRI is a useful technique for distinguishing between these entities. Invasion of the cervical stroma, contrast enhancement, and low values on ADC maps are highly suggestive of malignancy. However, biopsy is sometimes necessary.

Benign mimickers

Nabothian cysts are generally incidental findings. They are hyperintense on T2WI and may have variable T1 signals. Nabothian cysts typically have no solid enhancing components. The tunnel cluster is a type of Nabothian cyst that shows complex cystic dilatation of the endocervical glands (Fig. 20). Identifying solid parts is the key to differentiating a tunnel cluster from neoplasms with a cystic component, such as adenoma malignum.

Fig. 20
Tunnel clusters visualized by axial oblique T2WI (a), coronal T2WI (b), sagittal T2WI (c), and DWI-ADC map (d). Clustered cystic spaces have a round or oval appearance, an absence of invasion of the deep cervical stroma, and no diffusion restriction (arrow in d)

Cervical polyps are common in women during the fifth decade of life and are the most frequent cause of intermenstrual bleeding in perimenopausal women. The classical cervical polyp arises from the cervical canal and exhibits a predominantly glandular structure with a fibrous core.

### Novel strategy for the management of cervical multicystic diseases [^112TS6mL]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 180 patients, from 15 hospitals, were initially registered for this study. We subsequently excluded 21 patients with cervical proliferative glandular lesions only incidentally detected as part of surgery performed for some other benign disease. Finally, 159 cases were included in the analysis. Their mean age was 52 years (range 31–80). Among the 159 cases of a cervical multicystic disease diagnosed at the 15 participating hospitals, the preoperative diagnosis was: 19 cases of suspected cancer, 21 cases of suspected benign disease, and 119 cases that were 'suspicious of LEGH' or 'suspicious of LEGH — but MDA cancer cannot be ruled out' (Table 2). Clinical over-diagnosis of malignancy (suspicion of MDA) occurred for 12/19 cases (63.2%) and under-diagnosis of malignancy occurred for 4/11 (36%).

### The first step toward diagnosing female genital schistosomiasis by computer image analysis [^111GAL4W]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2015). Low credibility.

Future research.

Although the computer color analysis shows promising results in terms of accuracy, the specificity is still lacking. One reason for the high rate of false positives may be detection of other gynecological conditions, such as nabothian cysts, which may also appear yellow. However, the nabothian cysts have a very smooth appearance as opposed to the sandy patches and we believe that texture analysis should be explored for a more precise classification. Furthermore, abnormal vessels in FGS are described as convoluted (cork screw), reticular, or branched with uneven caliber; and the analysis should be expanded to recognize these.

It is necessary to assess the safety of using alternative electronic devices for diagnostic purposes in FGS. Although the images do not depict identifiable traits in the patient, they should be considered sensitive and as such, they must be encrypted and not stored longer than necessary. It may not even be necessary to store the original image if the computer analysis can be performed directly on the device. In the case, the images needed to be transmitted for telediagnostic purposes, it would be of paramount importance to implement proper encryption technology. This is particularly important to consider if one were to use a mobile phone camera to capture and/or transmit the images. Furthermore, it is necessary to assess the patient acceptability of using alternative imaging devices, such as mobile phone cameras. Patients may not feel comfortable with the use of such devices unless it is made clear how images are processed and protected.

Cervical cell atypia is a very important differential diagnosis that must not be confounded with FGS, as correct follow-up and treatment is critical to patient outcome. Several methods have been published on computerized analysis of cervical images stained with acetic acid for screening of cervical cell atypia. In developing an automated analysis for FGS, it would be very useful to implement a conjoint tool to increase the specificity of the diagnostic advice and avoid fatal misclassification of lesions.

### Single-visit approach of cervical cancer screening: see and treat in Indonesia [^115PMZ7G]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Test methods

With an adequate light source, the cervix was inspected visually. With a cotton swap, a 5% diluted acetic acid solution was applied to the cervix for 1 min. After application, acetowhite lesions in the transformation zone, close to the squamocolumnar junction, were considered positive and eligible for treatment. Cervicitis, nabothian cysts and polyps were considered negative. Biopsy was taken of all VIA-positive lesions and polyps were removed; both specimens were sent to the Department of Pathology of the collaborating University Hospital for diagnosis.

When the VIA result was negative, subsequent screening was advised at 1 year, according to the Indonesian guidelines. When the screening test was positive, women were counselled for immediate cryotherapy.

Cryotherapy was considered if the lesion was not suspected for cervical cancer, did not extend over more than 75% of the cervix, into the cervical canal or vaginal wall, and could be covered fully by the cryotherapy probe. Cryotherapy was provided in cycles of 3 min of freeze, 3 min of thaw and 3 min of freeze with an Erbe cryogun (Tuebingen, Germany) using a cone-shaped probe and CO 2 gas (Jakarta and Tasikmalaya) or N 2 O (Bali). After cryotherapy, women received non-narcotic analgesics and one oral dose of antibiotics, according to the Indonesian guidelines. They were informed about side effects and instructed not to have sexual intercourse for 4 weeks and to return to the health centre in case of severe abdominal pain, fever (> 38 °C) and purulent or bloody discharge.

### Novel strategy for the management of cervical multicystic diseases [^111FKzqS]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Two gynecologic radiologists independently assessed the above radiologic features of the tumor, without knowing any of the patients' original diagnosis or clinical information. Based on the morphology and distribution of the cysts, each radiologist made a radiological diagnosis according to the diagnostic imaging algorithm described above. Lesions were classified into four types based on the above-described cyst and solid component patterns. Types 1 to 3 comprised only a multicystic component. Type 1, "lesion confined to the lower portion of the cervix", "macrocystic pattern", or "mixed pattern without cosmos sign", were regarded as suspicious of miscellaneous benign glandular hyperplasia, including a nabothian cyst (NC); type 2, "cosmos pattern or microcystic pattern without diffuse growth and focal mass-like bulging" were regarded as suspicious of possibly LEGH; type 3, a mixed or microcystic pattern exhibiting "diffuse growth", or "focal mass-like bulging" were regarded as suspicious of premalignancy (assumption of atypical LEGH) or possible malignancy; type 4, "sold and cystic pattern", were regarded as suspicious of malignancy (Table 1).

Table 1
Classification of MRI findings

LEGH lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasia

We investigated the diagnostic value of various clinical parameters, including MRI and cytology, and evaluated their usefulness for diagnostic accuracy regarding multicystic diseases of the cervix using a combination of these parameters.

Statistical Analysis

Continuous variables were summarized as mean ± standard deviation and categorical variables as frequency and percentage. The Cochran-Armitage trend test was used to ascertain whether malignant or atypical LEGH increases in the order of type 4 morphology of MRI. The McNemar's test was used to check whether cytology results were consistent with pathology results. To assess the associations between MRI findings and histopathological diagnosis, Fisher's exact test and the Freeman-Halton test were used. Statistical significance was determined when the p -value was less than 0.05. JMP software, version 16.0, (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, USA) were used for the statistical analysis.

### Cervical ectopy: associations with sexually transmitted infections and HIV. A cross-sectional study of high school students in rural South Africa [^114GVWmo]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2015). Low credibility.

Image material

During the inclusion period, a total of 781 women underwent gynaecological examination with acquisition of colposcopic images. One image was selected per patient based on the following inclusion criteria: at least 25% of the ectocervical surface was visible, the cervical os was visible, a part of the cervical curvature was visible, and the focus was adequate for identifying anatomical landmarks. During the measurements, images were excluded if there was heavy inflammation rendering the evaluation impossible or if there was a non-cervical element rendering the extent of ectopy non-evaluable (such as blood, discharge or a medical instrument). The best image was chosen independent of whether it was taken before or after sampling for Pap smear, cervico-vaginal lavage or application of acetic acid.

Computer assisted measurement of cervical ectopy

All measurements were performed using the open source image analysis software ImageJ (US National Institutes of Health). It allows for a visually guided delimitation of structures and a subsequent measurement of the selected area (figure 2). We further calculated the ectopy as a fraction of the total ectocervical area. Finally, the images were saved with the measurement overlays for verification and adjustment by a senior gynaecologist (MO).

Dotted line: Current squamocolumnar junction, represents the border between columnar epithelium and metaplastic squamous epithelium in the transformation zone.

The ectocervical area was delimited by using the cervical os as the centre of an elliptical shape that was manually fitted to conform to the visible cervical boundaries. The original squamocolumnar junction was defined as the outer delimitation of any of the following structures: glandular openings, Nabothian cysts and primary rugae extending from the cervical os. In cases where such anatomical landmarks were absent or too sparse, the original squamocolumnar junction was not measured. Finally, the current squamocolumnar junction (confining the area of ectopy) was defined as a distinct transition of colour from deep red to brighter red: The columnar epithelium is single layered and appears dense red whereas the transformation zone is covered in squamous epithelium, appearing brighter in colour.

Colposcopy

According to the 2011 International Federation for Cervical Pathology and Colposcopy (IFCPC) classification, colposcopic examination included a general assessment and colposcopy findings. The general assessment measured adequacy, squamocolumnar junction visibility (fully visible, partially visible, and non-visible), and transformation zone (TZ) types 1–3. Colposcopy findings were classified as normal (normal colposcopic impression; including original squamous epithelium, Nabothian follicles, metaplastic squamous epithelium, and crypt or gland openings); positive minor or grade 1 (minor grade changes including fine vascular patterns, faint white epithelial uptake after acetic acid, irregular or geographical borders, and satellite lesions); positive major or grade 2 (major grade changes including sharp lesion borders, inner borders [within the TZ], presence of the ridge sign, dense or rapid uptake of acetic acid [or both], coarse vascular patterns [mosaic or punctate], and cuffed crypt or gland openings); or suspected invasive cancer (atypical vessels, fragile vessels, an irregular epithelial surface, exophytic lesions, necrosis, ulceration, tumour formation, or gross neoplasm).

At least one experienced colposcopist was selected per study centre, preferably with a clinical practice in the recruitment area, and was involved in extensive training sessions on study procedures and clinical management with detailed algorithms, continuous supervision, and quality assessment. Three of 15 colposcopists were already IFCPC colposcopy certified trainers, seven were trained to obtain the IFCPC colposcopy certificate, and two became certified trainers. At colposcopy, two to three biopsies from observed lesions were collected for all participants in whom acetowhite lesions were present and if the colposcopy was positive with TZ1 or TZ2. Endocervical sampling using cytology or histology (using the cell block technique) was recommended when a TZ3 was observed, and excision type 2 or 3 was performed when high-grade disease was diagnosed (HSIL+ cytology or CIN2+ histology).

### Florid cystic endosalpingiosis of the uterus [^117Xr62p]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

A 73 year old woman presented with a right sided adnexal cystic mass. At laparotomy, this proved to be a benign serous ovarian cyst and an aggregation of thin walled subserosal and soft tissue cysts and spongy nodules up to 16 mm in diameter involving the side wall of the uterus and adjacent parametrium. These were removed by total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Histologically, the cystic spaces and smaller acini were lined by benign tubo-endometrioid epithelium, with smaller areas typical of serous differentiation and rare microfoci of endocervical-type mucinous epithelium. These features indicated multidirectional Mullerian differentiation in a process that, overall, was consistent with so called florid cystic endosalpingiosis. This lesion is to be distinguished from other benign conditions including multicystic mesothelioma, endometriosis, endocervicosis, florid deep glands of the uterine cervix, and deep Nabothian cysts of the uterine cervix.

Diagnosis of Malignant Diseases

The clinicopathological data of 11 patients with malignant disease (after CPR) are summarized in Supplemental Table 3. Of these 11 patients, seven were diagnosed with GAS, three with UEA, and one with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Four out of the seven GAS and two out of the four other types of carcinomas were associated with LEGH. In six out of seven available GAS patient cytological reports, three (50.0%) had abnormal cervical cytology (one AGC, and two adenocarcinomas). Of the four GAS cases where results of punch biopsy were available, a malignant lesion was detected in two patients (50.0%). The one case with GAS who underwent conization was diagnosed as having GAS (1/1, 100%). In contrast, all patients with other types of carcinomas were detected as malignancy by cytological evaluation and punch biopsy or conization. Three patients with GAS received radical hysterectomies and pelvic lymph node dissections, and four patients received a simple or modified radical hysterectomy due to a suspicion of LEGH and were diagnosed incidentally post-surgery via the resected uterus, whereas all patients with other types of carcinomas received radical hysterectomies and pelvic lymph node dissection. Postoperatively, four patients received radiotherapy and one patient received chemotherapy. During the median follow-up period of 50 months (ranging from 1 to 62 months), one patient with stage IB1 UEA developed a recurrence at the vaginal stump 15 months after the initial surgery and is still alive with the disease.

MRI Findings and the Possibility of Using Them for Preoperative Diagnosis

Of the 159 enrolled patients, 118 who had both MRI data and pathological diagnosis by hysterectomy specimen were subjected to our algorithm analysis. There were 99 benign diseases (40 LEGH cases; 59 other benign proliferating disease cases), nine premalignant diseases (seven atypical LEGH cases and two cases of LEGH with AIS), and ten malignant diseases (GAS, 7 cases; other adenocarcinomas, 3 cases). The category of MRI findings and final pathological diagnoses are presented in Table 5 and Supplemental Table 5.

Results of Central Pathological Review (CPR)

Table 3 shows the differences between the pathological diagnosis at the participating hospitals and the results of our central pathological review (CPR). The pathological diagnoses made at the participating hospitals were 20 cancer cases (14 GAS, including MDA, and 6 other types of carcinomas), 84 miscellaneous benign glandular diseases, and 55 LEGH (including atypical LEGH). Of the 55 LEGH patients, 45 were categorized with LEGH and 10 with other benign glandular proliferative diseases. Of 84 cases of miscellaneous benign glandular disease other than LEGH, the CPR diagnosis was mostly consistent with the original diagnosis (80 benign diseases and 4 LEGH). Of note, of 20 cases locally diagnosed with malignant disease (before CPR), only 11 cases (55.0%) were confirmed to be malignant disease, and 9 (45.0%) were diagnosed by CPR as being benign or as atypical LEGH.

Table 3
Original diagnosis and CPR results

Of the 14 cases initially diagnosed as MDA or GAS, CPR revealed that only five cases (35.7%) were GAS or MDA. Two were atypical LEGH, five were pure LEGH, and two were miscellaneous benign glandular diseases. (Table 3 and Supplemental Table 2). Finally, CPR revealed 56 cases of LEGH (including nine atypical LEGH), seven with GAS including MDA, four with other types of invasive carcinoma, and 92 cases of miscellaneous benign glandular proliferative disease (Supplemental Table 2).

Pathological diagnosis was made by analysis of the hysterectomy specimen in 125 cases, and from the conization specimen in 34 cases. The patients' characteristics are summarized in Table 4.

### MR imaging of the uterine cervix: imaging-pathologic correlation [^114RvK7M]. Radiographics (2003). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is useful not only for preoperative staging of gynecologic malignancies but also for prediction of the histopathologic features of a variety of intrapelvic tumors. Familiarity with the specific imaging findings that have been reported for the uterine cervix is a goal of radiologists. The typical MR imaging findings of uterine cervical lesions correspond to the histopathologic features. These lesions can be categorized as epithelial neoplasms, nonepithelial neoplasms, and nonneoplastic diseases. Cervical carcinoma accounts for most cases of malignant lesions and is staged by using the classification system established by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics. MR imaging allows differentiation between endophytic and exophytic growth and between normal and abnormal findings after hysterectomy and irradiation. Other epithelial neoplasms of the uterine cervix include adenoma malignum, which is a special type of cervical adenocarcinoma, as well as carcinoid tumor and malignant melanoma. Nonepithelial neoplasms of the uterine cervix include malignant lymphoma and leiomyoma. Nonneoplastic diseases of the uterine cervix include cervical pregnancy, cervicitis, nabothian cysts, polyps, and endometriosis.

### Nabothian cyst a predominant cause of false-positive iodine uptake in uterus: comparison of SPECT / CT and pelvic MRI [^117TCeAa]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Many cases of unexpected radioiodine uptake have been reported, including physiological uptake in healthy tissue and in both benign and malignant nonthyroidal lesions. However, iodine uptake in the uterus has not been well assessed. In this article, we systemically analyzed iodine uptake in the uterus and identified the site in which uptake occurred.

Materials and Methods

Seventy-six female patients who underwent SPECT/CT from neck to pelvis were included in this study; 5 patients with uterine uptake received pelvic MRI. Iodine uptake in the uterus was diagnosed with SPECT/CT and compared with the findings of the MRI. Serum TSH level, administered dose of iodine-131 and number of radioiodine therapies were compared between the 2 groups with and without iodine uptake in the uterus.

Results

Twenty (26.3%) of 76 patients showed iodine uptake in the uterine cervix on SPECT/CT. It was difficult to distinguish the uptake in the uterus from that in the urinary bladder or rectum using only planar images. The patients with the uterine uptake were younger than those without (median age, 46.5 vs. 62, P = 0.011). There were no significant differences in serum TSH level, administered dose of iodine-131, or number of radioiodine therapies between the 2 groups. In all instances of the 5 patients who underwent pelvic MRI, iodine uptake in the uteri was located in nabothian cysts.

Conclusion

Iodine uptake in the uterus is frequently found if pelvic SPECT/CT is performed. Nabothian cysts are a predominant cause of iodine uptake in the uterine cervix.

### Management of tarlov cysts: an uncommon but potentially serious spinal column disease-review of the literature and experience with over 1, 000 referrals [^111ikmUr]. Neuroradiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Anatomy and pathogenesis

There are numerous benign cystic conditions that can involve the spine and spinal cord. Since Tarlov first detailed characteristics of cystic lesions of the spinal nerve roots and introduced the term perineural cysts, various other spinal cyst-like abnormalities have been identified and an array of confusing terms have been employed. Goyal et al. first introduced a simplified classification for the various intraspinal conditions differentiating perineural cysts, root sleeve dilations, intradural or extradural arachnoid cysts, and meningeal diverticulum. Since then, Nabors et al. described spinal meningeal cysts as diverticula of the spinal meningeal sac, nerve root sheath, or arachnoid. For simplicity, he referred to them all as meningeal cysts and introduced a simplified MR-based classification for these conditions consisting of three groups — type I, extradural meningeal cysts without spinal nerve root fibers; type II, extradural meningeal cysts with spinal nerve root fibers; and type III, spinal intradural meningeal cysts.

Perineural cysts (Tarlov cysts) can belong to either Nabor's group I or II, with or without spinal nerve root fibers. Anatomically, Tarlov cysts are cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled sacs that commonly occur at the junction of the posterior root and the dorsal ganglion appearing as gross dilations of spinal nerve root sleeves. The cyst occupies the space between the perineurium (arachnoid covering the nerve root) and the endoneurium (outer layer of the pia). Nerve root fibers, and occasionally ganglion cells, exist within the cyst wall or freely in the cyst, and the entire cyst may be surrounded by neural tissues. They commonly exist at the sacral level (Fig. 1) but have been reported to exist at other spinal levels including the lumbar and cervical regions.

### Carcinoma in situ in a lateral cervical cyst [^114HJmZc]. Head & Neck (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The development of an invasive squamous cell carcinoma within a lateral cervical cyst as a result of malignant transformation of the epithelium is considered a rare circumstance. The existence of this entity is a source of controversy in light of the differential diagnosis, which includes a cervical metastasis from an unknown primary carcinoma (CUP-syndrome). Apart from site, histologic findings, and follow-up, the principal diagnostic criterion for lateral cervical cyst carcinoma is the histomorphologic demonstration of transition of the benign epithelium into invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Although numerous case reports of this entity exist, carcinoma in situ in a lateral cervical cyst has been reported in only five cases thus far.

Method

In this context, we present the case of a 44-year-old patient with a 7-month history of cervical swelling.

Results

After diagnostic extirpation of the tumor, histologic findings were consistent with a lateral branchial cyst with high-grade dysplasia and carcinoma in situ of the squamous epithelial lining.

Conclusion

This case of a premalignant lesion within a lateral branchial cyst (ie, carcinoma in situ) supplies the "missing link" and adds credibility to the concept of primary branchiogenic carcinoma.

### MRI findings before and after abdominal radical trachelectomy (ART) for cervical cancer: a prospective study and review of the literature [^117Rg6Vb]. Clinical Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Aim

To report the authors' experience with dedicated pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in young women with early-stage cervical cancer treated with abdominal radical trachelectomy (ART).

Materials and Methods

During a 5-year period, 21 patients, with biopsy-confirmed cervical carcinoma, International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage ≤ IB1, were considered for trachelectomy. All patients underwent pelvic MRI within 30 days prior to surgery. Tumour size, endocervical extension, extrauterine spread, and nodal status were noted. Postoperative MRI findings were reviewed in 16 patients.

Results

Nineteen of the 21 patients were treated with ART. In two patients, trachelectomy was aborted intraoperatively and radical hysterectomy was performed; preoperative MRI findings were consistent with surgicopathological examination in both patients. MRI correctly assessed tumour size in 18/21 patients, coming within 5 mm of the surgical specimen. Tumour size was underestimated in two cases because of circumferential growth (n = 1) or technical difficulties (n = 1). False-positive MRI result was due to post-biopsy inflammation (n = 1). MRI accurately identified absence of internal os involvement in 17/19 ART patients; false-positive MRI for internal os involvement were due to endocervical polyp (n = 1) and coexisting Nabothian cysts (n = 1). No trachelectomy patient had extrauterine disease or malignant nodes at MRI or final histology. Post-trachelectomy complications included hydrosalpinges (n = 3), lymphocysts (n = 2), isthmic stenosis (n = 1), and tumour relapse (n = 2).

Conclusions

Dedicated pelvic MRI is helpful in assessing tumour size and endocervical extension in young women, candidates for ART. Hydrosalpinx may occur after ART and it may influence fertility potential.

### Novel strategy for the management of cervical multicystic diseases [^111rk3ZR]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, multicystic lesions with type 3 or 4 MRI morphologies were at high risk of premalignancy or malignancy. When the MRI showed a type 3 or 4 morphology in association with at least AGC in the Pap smear, active management, such as biopsy or conization, or hysterectomy, may be reasonable to address the possibility of premalignancy or malignancy. These diagnostic criteria should be evaluated in future prospective studies.

Squamous cell carcinoma throughout the epithelium of a lateral cervical cyst is considered extremely rare. This report describes an additional case of this very rare clinical condition. A 70-year-old man presented with a well-defined, immobile, painless mass in the left neck that was excised with a diagnosis of branchial cyst. Histologic findings of the excised specimen were lateral branchial cyst with high-grade dysplasia and carcinoma of the squamous epithelial lining. The patient was followed for more than 2 years 10 months and no evidence of recurrence or other cancer has been found.

### Ber-EP4 immunoreactivity depends on the germ layer origin and maturity of the squamous epithelium [^112JFPxP]. Histopathology (2001). Low credibility.

Aim

To map the expression of Ber-EP4 in well-differentiated squamous epithelia, metaplastic squamous epithelia and dysplastic squamous epithelia of different origins.

Methods and Results

Squamous epithelium of different origin was stained using a standard immunohistochemistry method applied to paraffin sections. We found that normal squamous epithelium of the oral cavity, oesophagus, uterine cervix, vagina, anal canal, and branchial cysts are Ber-Ep4-negative, as are the mature squamous metaplasia of bronchial mucosa, urinary bladder mucosa and uterine cervical mucosa. In contrast, immature squamous metaplasia of bronchial mucosa, or uterine cervical mucosa, and squamous dysplasia of oral mucosa of endodermal origin, or uterine cervical mucosa in most cases expressed Ber-EP4.

Conclusion

Squamous epithelia of ectodermal origin never express Ber-EP4, whether normal, hyperplastic, dysplastic or neoplastic. In contrast, squamous epithelium of endodermal origin sometimes contains the target glycoproteins of Ber-EP4 when immature, metaplastic, dysplastic or neoplastic. The results indicate that the differences in expression of Ber-EP4 in squamous epithelium depend primarily on germ layer origin, and on the maturity of the epithelium.

### Management of congenital midline cervical cleft [^112TkwGB]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Congenital midline cervical cleft (CMCC) is a rare developmental defect of the anterior neck normally characterized by an atrophic mucosal plaque with a cranial nipple-like skin tag, a short caudal sinus, and may be attached to a subcutaneous fibrous cord of variable length. Clinically, patients present at an early age with, white females being the most commonly affected population. In addition to aesthetic concerns, CMCC can prevent full extension of the neck, result in micrognathia and torticollis, predispose patients to infection, and can coexist with other clefting defects or cysts. Fewer than 50 cases have been published in the English-language literature. Herein, we report a case of CMCC that also presented with a mild contracture of the right sternohyoid muscle. The embryopathogenesis, histopathology, diagnosis, and treatment of this rare condition are also discussed.

### DICER1 hotspot mutations in non-epithelial gonadal tumours [^116xQ521]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

In recent years, the role of DICER in cancer progression and prognosis has been extensively studied. In several cancers, including lung, breast, ovarian and endometrial carcinoma, low levels of DICER expression are associated with poorer survival rates. Conversely, in prostate and colorectal cancers, higher expression of DICER has been shown to be associated with a worse prognosis. DICER1 is the only gene in the miRNA pathway in which germline mutations predispose to a Mendelian disorder, which is characterised by a range of mainly paediatric-onset cancers. Germline mutations were first discovered in patients with pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB), a rare lung tumour, who all had a family history of PPB or the related familial tumour dysplasia syndrome (PPB-FTDS, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) number, 601200). This syndrome commonly includes cystic nephroma, ovarian SCSTs (particularly SLCTs), and multinodular goitre. Since then, additional rare neoplasms have been included in the DICER1 syndrome, when they were shown to be associated with deleterious germline DICER1 mutations, including cervical embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS), ciliary-body medulloepithelioma, pituitary blastoma, cervical primitive neuroectodermal tumour, juvenile intestinal hamartomatous polyps and Wilms tumour.

4 Scientific rationale behind targeted intervention strategies

The observation that most cervical precancerous lesions develop within the area of squamous metaplastic epithelium was an important milestone in understanding cervical oncogenesis and is credited to Hans Hinselmann (1884–1959). He presented a completely new view of cervical oncogenesis based on his colposcopic and histologic findings. He described two different types of cervical squamous epithelia. The first type was the (preexisting) original squamous epithelium, and the second type was a newly formed squamous metaplastic epithelium. He called this zone (area) of metaplastic epithelium "Umwandlungszone". This sentinel publication was in German language. Much later the term "Umwandlungszone" was translated as transformation zone (TZ). Colposcopist throughout the world use the term TZ for an area were squamous metaplasia is in progress, and quite often refer to the area of manifest metaplasia. The original SCJ between original squamous epithelium and metaplastic squamous epithelium is the outer border of the TZ and remains a landmark throughout life. The new SCJ is found between the expanding metaplastic squamous epithelium and the endocervical columnar epithelium, and is typically a well developed circumferential step-like border. The newly formed area/zone of metaplasia is complex, as fully matured metaplastic epithelium co-exists with still immature squamous epithelium. During active squamous metaplasia small islands of immature metaplastic squamous epithelium may interdigitate with endocervical columnar epithelium, and small islands of immature squamous metaplastic epithelium appear within endocervical columnar epithelium. The concept of squamous metaplasia is central to the understanding of the pathogenesis of HSIL/SCC because the maturation level of squamous epithelium at time of HPV infections determines the cancer risk (;. Mature metaplastic (glycogenated) squamous epithelium has the same low risk for HSIL/SCC than the original squamous epithelium of cervix and vagina. The high-risk area, however, where most HSIL/SCC arise, corresponds to the area where (proliferating) reserve cells and immature metaplastic squamous epithelium are easily accessible for HPV. Two types of reserve cells of different embryonic origin and in prenatally determined distribution are capable of squamous metaplasia, and both can be identified throughout the entire endocervical columnar epithelium (Fig. 1). Reserve cells of urogenital sinus (UGS) origin, characterised by p63/CK17 co-expression, are concentrated in endocervical columnar epithelium near the SCJ and serve as primary target cells for squamous metaplasia. During second trimester growth and remodelling, they migrate towards the cervix and reach their final location in the last trimester. The second type of reserve cells expresses CK7 and is of Müllerian origin. They serve as stem cells for columnar cells and AIS. These reserve cells have stem cell character as they have also the capacity to acquire CK17/p63 expression and to develop into squamous metaplastic epithelium, (recurrent) HSIL, and SCC. Based on this knowledge, it is a robust argument to use the term TZ for the entire zone/area where squamous metaplasia can occur and has occurred (Fig. 2). Colposcopically, however, only the area of manifest squamous metaplasia can be appreciated.

Screening Strategies

Participants were instructed to abstain from sexual activity, vaginal irrigation, or vaginal drug administration within 3 days prior to screening. Those with reproductive tract inflammation were advised to undergo screening after treatment. All participants primarily underwent gynecological examination, including bimanual or vagino-recto-abdominal examination, as well as microscopic examination of vaginal discharge (Figure 1). Based on the findings during the gynecological examination, participants with clinically suspicious cancer-related abnormalities, such as contact bleeding or a cauliflower-like mass located at the cervix, were referred to direct colposcopy regardless of the primary screening outcome. Conversely, participants without visible abnormalities or with visible lesions related to benign diseases, such as Nesbitt gland cysts, would proceed with primary screening.

### Radiolucent lesions of the mandible: a pattern-based approach to diagnosis [^112HXENW]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Dentigerous cyst

Follicular cysts, also called dentigerous cysts or pericoronal cysts, are the second most common odontogenic mandibular cysts and the most common developmental cysts of odontogenic origin. They are typically seen in patients aged 20–40. Once fluid accumulates between the enamel organ remnants and the tooth crown, a cyst forms around the crown of the unerupted tooth (typically the lower third molar). Imaging features of follicular cysts are characteristic and include a unilocular, well-defined radiolucent lesion with sclerotic borders around an unerupted tooth crown (Fig. 3). Small follicular cysts may be difficult to differentiate from a normal dental follicle. It has been suggested that when the distance between the crown and the dental sac is superior to 3 mm, the diagnosis of a follicular cyst should be made. The cyst is most often attached to the neck of the unerupted and displaced tooth, and the crown generally protrudes into the cyst while the roots remain outside the lesion (Fig. 3). Follicular cysts may become very large and may remodel the mandible, predisposing the patient to pathological fracture and infection. They may thin the cortical layer of the mandible and may insinuate around the mandibular canal, making surgical excision risky. CT and CBCT are used to determine the relationship of the cyst to the mandibular canal prior to surgery and to assess cyst contents, as well as integrity of the cortical rim (Fig. 3). MRI is indicated only in atypical cases to differentiate follicular cysts from other cystic mandibular lesions. Follicular cysts will often be found incidentally in patients undergoing head and neck MRI for other indications. MRI findings include variable signal intensity on T1 due to variable protein content within the cyst, high signal on T2 and occasionally slight enhancement of the thin cyst wall. Although most cysts show no significant FDG uptake on PET/CT, mild tracer uptake may be seen in the presence of infection or inflammation. Treatment options include enucleation in smaller lesions and marsupialisation in larger cysts. Rarely, SCC (see "Pitfalls") or ameloblastoma may arise from the epithelium of the cyst wall. Multiple follicular cysts are very rare and may be seen in cleidocranial dysplasia, muccopolysaccharidosis type 4 and in the Gorlin-Goltz syndrome.

"AGC results are relatively uncommon, with a mean reporting rate of only 0.4% in the United States in 2003". Compared with squamous abnormalities, "AGC is more common in women 40 years and older". "Recent series have reported that 9% to 38% of women with AGC have significant neoplasia (CIN 2,3, AIS, or cancer) and 3% to 17% have invasive cancer". Additionally, "CIN lesions have been found in 8% to 83% of women with AGC, of which 40% to 68% are CIN 2, 3".

6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

The safety of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol was evaluated in 1,723 subjects who participated in a randomized, partially blinded, multicenter, active-controlled clinical trial of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol for contraception. This trial examined healthy, nonpregnant, volunteers aged 18 to 45 (nonsmoker if 35 to 45 years of age), who were sexually active with regular coitus. Subjects were followed for up to 13 28-day cycles.

Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2% of subjects): The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 1,723 women using the 28-day regimen were the following in order of decreasing incidence: headache/migraine (30.5%), nausea/vomiting (16.3%); breast issues (including tenderness, pain, enlargement, swelling, discharge, discomfort, cyst, and nipple pain) (10.3%), abdominal pain (9.2%), menstrual disorders (including dysmenorrhea, menstrual discomfort, menstrual disorder) (9.2%), mood disorders (including depression, mood altered, mood swings and depressed mood) (7.6%); acne (5.1%), vulvovaginal infection (3.5%), abdominal distension (2.8%), weight increased (2.4%), fatigue (2.1%).

Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: In the clinical trial of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol 4% of subjects discontinued the trial due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were headache/migraine (1.2%), nausea/vomiting (0.7%), cervical dysplasia (0.7%), abdominal pain (0.4%), ovarian cyst (0.3%), acne (0.2%), flatulence (0.2%) and depression (0.2%).

Congenital cervical anomalies are important to consider in the differential of head and neck masses in children and adults. These lesions can present as palpable cystic masses, infected masses, draining sinuses, or fistulae. Thyroglossal duct cysts are most common, followed by branchial cleft anomalies, dermoid cysts, and more rarely median cervical clefts. Other topics discussed include median ectopic thyroid, cervical teratomas, and branchiootorenal syndrome. Appropriate diagnosis and management of these lesions requires a complete understanding of their embryology and anatomy. Correct diagnosis, resolution of infectious issues before definitive therapy, and complete surgical excision are essential to prevent recurrence.

### Osteoporosis is the most important risk factor for odontoid fractures in the elderly [^111gwir9]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2017). Low credibility.

Traumatic odontoid fractures (TOFs) have been described as the most common injury affecting the C-spine in the elderly. Previous studies have identified degenerative changes and bone loss as important predisposing factors. However, their interaction and respective age-adjusted impact needs further clarification. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 5303 patients (aged ≥ 60 years) admitted to a level I trauma center between January 2008 and January 2016 who underwent CT imaging of the C-spine. Ninety-two patients with TOF and 80 patients with other cervical spine fractures (OCSF) were identified and a respective 3:1 age- and sex-matched control group without fractures after trauma was built. In all groups, cervical bone mineral density (cBMD) was determined using phantom calibration, and degenerative changes were evaluated in a qualitative manner. In all groups, the severity of degenerative changes of the C-spine increased with age (all p < 0.05) and was inversely correlated with cBMD (all p < 0.05). cBMD was the only significant predictor of a TOF in a multivariate logistic regression model (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 3.066, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.432–6.563 for cervical osteoporosis). An association between odontoid cysts and TOF reached significance only in Anderson and D'Alonzo (A&D) type II TOFs (aOR = 1.383; 95% CI 1.012–1.890). Patients with OCSFs, compared with patients with TOFs, were younger (median 74 versus 83 years) and had a higher cBMD (median 208mg/mL versus 172mg/mL). No differences were observable when comparing cBMD and grades of degenerative changes between OCSFs and their control group (all p > 0.1). Decreased cBMD is the major predisposing factor for the occurrence of TOF but not for OCSF in the elderly. The severity of odontoid cysts was found to be a cBMD-independent factor associated with A&D type II TOFs. However, degenerative changes in the odontoid neighboring joints seem to be an epiphenomenon of bone loss and older age but do not independently predispose for TOF. © 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

Annual cervical/vaginal cytology tests can be considered as indicated for detection of lower genital tract dysplasia; the Panel does not recommend workup of low‑grade squamous dysplasia detected during surveillance, but suggests that patients should follow up with a provider with specific expertise in this area, and it is important to emphasize good clinical evaluation and a high index of suspicion because the detection rate of recurrent cervical cancer is low using cervical and vaginal cytology alone.

Malignant and Premalignant Diseases

Of the ten cases with malignant disease, four (40%) showed type 4 morphology, and six (60%) showed type 3. Of nine LEGH with atypia, seven (77.8%), one (11.1%), and one (11.1%) showed type 3, type 2, and type 1 morphology, respectively. The malignancy or atypical LEGH were observed 2.9% (1/35), 2.0% (1/49), 43.3% (13/30), and 100% (4/4) in types 1 to 4, respectively (p < 0.0001 for trend).

When both type 3 or 4 MRI morphologies and abnormal cytology were shown, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and OR for differentiating malignancy or premalignancy were 61.1%, 96.7%, 73.3%, 94.4%, and 46.357, respectively. The P value of the McNemar analysis was 0.366, which means that the findings of MRI morphology and cytology results consistently correlated with benign and malignant pathology results.

### Dysplasia classification: pathology in disgrace? [^116JkxYG]. The Journal of Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

Grading of dysplasia is demanded almost daily from most diagnostically active pathologists. It is also notoriously subjective and lacks intra- and inter-observer reproducibility. This is partly due to the lack of validated morphological criteria, upon which pathologists have reached consensus. It is largely due to the biological nature of the evolution of dysplasia, not in discrete steps but as a continuum. Better morphological definition, but also fundamental research into the nature of the process, is necessary to resolve this issue.

### Novel strategy for the management of cervical multicystic diseases [^114XgamG]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

The presence of a solid component with a diffusion restriction within the lesion is an important finding suggesting malignancy, as described in previous reports. When MRI showed a type 4 morphology along with cellular atypia, the case was diagnosed as a malignancy (correct ratio: 3/3, 100%).

The clinical argument surrounds the management of multicystic lesions without a solid component, as reported previously, which corresponds to type 3 in our MRI category. Few reports focus on the MRI findings of MDA comprising only a cystic component. Omori et al. reported that AIS was identified in postmenopausal women showing a "raspberry-type" lesion with many tiny, closely aggregated cysts. However, in our study, the "raspberry pattern", which corresponds to the microcystic pattern, using our criteria, was not associated with the risk of malignancy. Other useful indicators for differentiating MDA comprising only a cystic component from benign multicystic diseases are unknown. Type 3, exhibiting "diffuse growth" or "focal mass-like bulging", is a newly proposed imaging feature in our criteria. In our cases, 60% (6/10) of the malignant lesions and 77.8% (7/9) of the premalignant lesions showed a type 3 MRI morphology. Lesions with "diffuse growth" or "focal mass-like bulging" were of significantly higher risk of malignancy or premalignancy (43.3%) compared with those with cosmos patterns without these features.

### A novel phenotype in N-glycosylation disorders: gillessen-kaesbach-nishimura skeletal dysplasia due to pathogenic variants in ALG9 [^116r5YBE]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

A rare lethal autosomal recessive syndrome with skeletal dysplasia, polycystic kidneys and multiple malformations was first described by Gillessen-Kaesbach et al and subsequently by Nishimura et al. The skeletal features uniformly comprise a round pelvis, mesomelic shortening of the upper limbs and defective ossification of the cervical spine. We studied two unrelated families including three affected fetuses with Gillessen-Kaesbach-Nishimura syndrome using whole-exome and Sanger sequencing, comparative genome hybridization and homozygosity mapping. All affected patients were shown to have a novel homozygous splice variant NM_024740.2: c.1173+2T > A in the ALG9 gene, encoding alpha-1,2-mannosyltransferase, involved in the formation of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor of N-glycosylation. RNA analysis demonstrated skipping of exon 10, leading to shorter RNA. Mass spectrometric analysis showed an increase in monoglycosylated transferrin as compared with control tissues, confirming that this is a congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG). Only three liveborn children with ALG9-CDG have been previously reported, all with missense variants. All three suffered from intellectual disability, muscular hypotonia, microcephaly and renal cysts, but none had skeletal dysplasia. Our study shows that some pathogenic variants in ALG9 can present as a lethal skeletal dysplasia with visceral malformations as the most severe phenotype. The skeletal features overlap with that previously reported for ALG3- and ALG12-CDG, suggesting that this subset of glycosylation disorders constitutes a new diagnostic group of skeletal dysplasias.

2006 consensus guidelines — General comments — For certain clinical situations there is limited high-quality evidence, and in these cases the guidelines have been based on consensus expert opinion. Acceptable management strategies reflect an acceptable level of risk of failing to detect high-grade neoplasia or cancer, and it is unreasonable to expect this risk can be reduced to zero; attempts to achieve zero risk could result in greater harm than good, including overtreatment. The guidelines should never substitute for clinical judgment, and clinical judgment should always be used when applying a guideline to an individual patient because it is impossible to develop guidelines that apply to all clinical situations.

### Congenital vertebral duplication: a predisposing risk factor for dissection [^117JxGxT]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2012). Low credibility.

Spontaneous cervical-artery dissection (CAD) is a major cause of cerebral ischaemia in young adults. While their pathophysiology remains still poorly understood, CAD is considered today as a multifactorial disease determined by general and local predisposing factors; these predisposing factors being predominantly constitutional abnormalities of the arterial wall. Here, we report an MRI-confirmed dissection of a duplicated vertebral artery, in a patient with attacks of vertigo due to cerebellar infarction following a minor neck trauma. Knowing that another case of vertebrobasilar CAD on a duplicated vertebral artery has been reported, these rare anatomical variants probably predispose to vertebral CAD, via local histological defects or significant hemodynamics alterations, as reported for the classical local predisposing conditions for vertebral dissection, i.e.: fibromuscular dysplasias or carotid redundancies (including loops, kinks and coils).

KEY FACTS — Mucosal Papillomavirus Infections in Humans
Condyloma acuminatum is one of the most common manifestations of HPV in the genital area 43. They present as papules, nodules or soft, filiform, pinkish, sessile or pedunculated growths. In men, genital condylomas more commonly involve the coronal sulcus, the glands penis, and the penile shaft. In women, lesions commonly affect the external genitalia and the cervix 44. The disease is usually sexually transmitted and is most frequently caused by low‐risk HPVs, such as HPV 6 and 11, although many other genotypes can also be found, including HPV 2, 16, 18, 30–33, 35, 39, 41–45, 51–56, and 59 45, 46, 47. As described in the text, the HPV types that cause benign genital warts can also cause problematic papillomas at oral sites, which can be difficult to treat because of their location.
Focal epithelial hyperplasia is a rare HPV‐related disease of the oral mucosa that is more common in children and women. Lesions are mainly located in the lower lip, but less frequently may affect the upper lip, tongue, oral mucosa, oropharynx, palate, and floor of mouth. HPV 13 and 32 are the most common cause 48.
Cervical neoplasia and cervical cancer. Precancerous cervical lesions are classified as c ervical CIN of different grades (1, 2, or 3). CIN1 pathology is broadly equivalent to the LSIL designation used in the Bethesda classification system, with CIN2 and 3 being equivalent to high‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. The severity of neoplasia reflects the extent to which basal‐like cells (i.e. poorly differentiated cells with a high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio) extend toward the epithelial surface and the extent of suprabasal cell division. Low‐grade lesions typically show evidence of productive viral infection with the presence of koilocytes in the suprabasal cell layers being regarded as a key manifestation of CIN1/LSIL. HPV is detectable in 90–100% of cervical abnormalities, ranging from incipient cytological abnormalities and dysplasia 49 to cervical cancer 50, 51, 52.
Other anogenital cancers including those of the vulva, vagina, penis, and anus. Most vulvar cancers (92%) are solitary, keratinizing SCC. HPV prevalence is 90% in vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia and basaloid or warty cancers, but is found in only 6% of keratinizing SCC 53, 54. HPV 16 is the most prominent type in vulvar cancer, with HPV 18, 21, 31, 33, and 34 detected at lower frequencies. In addition, HPV is responsible for 85% of vaginal cancer, with HPV 16 being detected in 60% of invasive tumors. HPV is also detected in basaloid and warty cancers of the penis, but only rarely in keratinizing SCC and verrucous cancers of the penis. In invasive penile cancer, HPV 16 is the most prevalent type (40–70%), followed by HPV 6 (22%), 52 (15%), and 11 (4%) 55. HPV is present in 80–96% of anal cancer with HPV 16 being the most prevalent type 56. Anal cancer is more common in men who have sex with men, individuals with a history of anal warts, and in immunosuppressed populations.
Head and neck cancer HPV is recognized as a major risk factor for the development of HNSCC. A recent meta‐analysis showed that HPV prevalence in HNSCC increased significantly from 41% in 2000 to 72% in 2004 57. HPV prevalence is significantly higher in oropharynx SCC than in the oral cavity with the tonsil having higher prevalence than other anatomic sites 58. These HPV‐associated cancers display clinical and molecular features distinct from other HNSCCs. The patients with HPV‐positive cancer have at least a 50% improvement in overall survival at 5 years, which is equivalent to an approximate 30% difference in absolute survival. HPV association is now part of routine diagnostic procedure when assessing the prognosis of HNSCC. HPV 16 is the most common type found in HNSCC, but other HPV types such as 18, 31, 33, and 35 can also be detected 57.

Image Analysis

We used MRI to categorize malignant potential by classifying the morphology and distribution of cysts, as follows:
The location of the lesion was classified into four parts (upper part, lower part, middle part, and the entire cervix).
The cyst and solid component patterns were categorized into four patterns as well: ① "Microcystic pattern" — only small cysts ≤ 3 mm were present, ② "Macrocystic pattern" — only cysts > 3 mm were present, ③ "Mixed pattern" — admixed microcysts and macrocysts (Supplemental Table 1), ④ "Solid and cystic pattern" — lesion comprised multiple cysts and solid components.

A 'solid component' was defined as a nodular or infiltrative solid tumor area, with diffusion restriction indicated by hyper-intensity on the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and hypo-intensity on the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map, relative to the uterine myometrium, suggesting possible malignancy. A solid-like hyper-intensity area seen at the center of a cosmos pattern was not regarded to be a solid component.

### Ischiopubic and odontoid synchondrosis in a boy with progressive pseudorheumatoid chondrodysplasia [^115a6UTE]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Currarino reviewed children with diastrophic dysplasia, spondylo-epiphyseal dysplasia congenita, pseudoachondroplasia, Larsen syndrome, and Gorham syndrome. He noted that the odontoid process consisted of two segments (bipartite dens), with an extra ossicle (ossiculum terminale) near the proximal end of odontoid process. He concluded that the appearance of the odontoid process in these patients was anomalous. PPRC did not feature in the group of the patients described.

Ischiopubic ossification defects have been connected to spine abnormalities in a number of remarkable reports.

The potential risk for both sudden death and significant morbidity as a result of instability of the upper cervical spine in os odontoideum has been extensively illustrated in the literature, highlighting the importance of the early detection of this condition. A hypoplastic odontoid is associated with a wide variety of skeletal dysplasias. Our patient presented with a detached os odontoideum and the likelihood is that an occult fracture of the axis occurred in conjunction with the remnants of the persistent vestigial cartilaginous synchondrosis. Normal children younger than 7 years of age who present with neck pain or neurological deficits raising concerns about spinal cord injury, an odontoid synchondrosis fracture should be ruled out. In children with skeletal dysplasias however, the impact of trivial injury might be much more drastic, and recommendations for ultimate screening is necessary.

We believe, that the constellation of adverse factors (such as a large pre-adulthood head, and the persistence of cartilaginous axis) predisposed to the detachment of the odontoid process and the development of an occult axis fracture. Finally, we highly recommend the CT scan as a valuable neuroimaging technique for evaluation of axial abnormalities in patients with skeletal dysplasias.

### Relative risk of cervical neoplasms among copper and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system users [^113N33fz]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

As early as the 1980s, studies suggested a reduced risk of cervical cancer among women who had used an intrauterine contraceptive. A 2017 systematic review of 17 case–control studies found that intrauterine devices (IUDs) were protective against cervical cancer. The summary odds ratio was 0.64 (95% CI 0.53, 0.77). Those authors suggested that the traumatic manipulation of the cervical canal may clear human papillomavirus (HPV) infection from a combination of acute and chronic inflammatory effects.

The studies harmonized for that meta-analysis did not report on IUD type. However, most of those studies collected data in countries and at times when the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) was not yet available. A progesterone-containing IUD, the Progestasert, was registered in the United States from 1976 to 2001. The Mirena (LNG-IUS) was first registered in Finland in 1990 and in the United States in 2000. Consequently, the studies in the meta-analysis mainly included either copper IUDs (Cu IUDs) or inert IUDs.

The copper ions in Cu IUDs may increase the clearance rate of HPV. In contrast, intrauterine levonorgestrel exposure may predispose the cervix to HPV infection, which is a precursor of cervical malignancy. Specifically, a decrease in prostaglandin production may suppress local immunity and render the uterus more susceptible to viral infection. The angiogenesis and increase in matrix metalloproteinase activity reported approximately 6 months after LNG-IUS placement may accelerate the growth of dysplasia. This analysis evaluates the association between LNG-IUS use compared with Cu IUD use and high-grade cervical neoplasms.

High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion morphology — In the cervix, HSIL (CIN 3) can present with a thin SIL in which the epithelium is less than 10 cells in thickness with mitotic activity above the basal layer and loss of nuclear polarity consistent with a high-grade lesion; high-grade keratinizing SIL often shows more cellular maturation in the middle layers, an abnormal keratinizing surface, and mitoses throughout the epithelium; although keratinizing dysplastic change is most commonly seen in cutaneous anogenital sites, it may be seen in mucosal areas such as the cervix or anal canal.

Other glandular abnormalities — benign-appearing endometrial and glandular cells: Approximately 0.5% to 1.8% of cervical cytology specimens from women 40 years old and older will have endometrial cells. Benign-appearing exfoliated endometrial cells in premenopausal women identified during either the first or the second half of the menstrual cycle are rarely associated with significant pathology, whereas benign-appearing endometrial cells in postmenopausal women are not infrequently associated with significant endometrial pathology. In a study of postmenopausal women with benign-appearing endometrial cells on routine cytology who underwent endometrial biopsy, 8% had significant pathology identified including endometrial adenocarcinoma in 5% of the women. After total hysterectomy, benign-appearing glandular cells derived from small accessory ducts, foci of benign adenosis, or prolapse of the fallopian tube into the vagina have no clinical significance.

3. Malignant Neoplasms

Breast Cancer

Ethynodiol diacetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets are contraindicated in females who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive (see Contraindications (4)).

Epidemiology studies have not found a consistent association between use of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) and breast cancer risk. Studies do not show an association between ever (current or past) use of COCs and risk of breast cancer. However, some studies report a small increase in the risk of breast cancer among current or recent users (< 6 months since last use) and current users with longer duration of COC use (see Post Marketing Experience).

Cervical Cancer

Some studies suggested that oral contraceptive use was associated with an increase in the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, dysplasia, erosion, carcinoma, or micro-glandular dysplasia in some populations of women.17, 50, 103–115However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.

In spite of many studies of the relationship between oral contraceptive use and breast and cervical cancers, a cause and effect relationship has not been established.
