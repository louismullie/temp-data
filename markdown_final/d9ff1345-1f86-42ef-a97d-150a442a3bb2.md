## Question

Should not methylene blue or hydroxycobalamin be started in most patients with sepsis before hypotension sets in?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether methylene blue or hydroxocobalamin should be started in most patients with sepsis before hypotension sets in, essentially as a preemptive therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether we are dealing with sepsis versus septic shock. Then, I should verify the pathophysiologic rationale for using NO pathway modulators preemptively. Next, I will review the evidence base for methylene blue and hydroxocobalamin, including timing, dosing, and outcomes. After that, I need to check safety, contraindications, and guideline positions. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation and highlight knowledge gaps that could change practice in the future.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. The question is about preemptive use in sepsis before hypotension, not about adjunctive therapy in established septic shock. Current randomized data for methylene blue and hydroxocobalamin are in septic shock populations, typically after vasopressors are already required, so extrapolating to pre-hypotension sepsis is a leap I need to be cautious about making [^114naJhP] [^115hRipN].

> I will now examine the pathophysiologic rationale. In septic shock, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is upregulated, driving excessive NO and cGMP-mediated vasodilation and contributing to vasopressor-refractory hypotension; methylene blue inhibits soluble guanylate cyclase and may also modulate iNOS, while hydroxocobalamin scavenges NO and may reduce hydrogen sulfide, another vasodilator [^113zRqbx] [^113384oF] [^115gu8cj]. Wait, let me verify the claim that methylene blue is a selective iNOS inhibitor; that is not precise — methylene blue's principal mechanism is sGC inhibition with additional NO-scavenging and iNOS-modulating effects, so I should correct that oversimplification here [^113384oF] [^113zRqbx]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: while NO excess is central in shock, NO also has beneficial roles in microcirculation and host defense; global NO pathway blockade can be harmful, as shown with nonselective NOS inhibitors, so preemptive inhibition in non-shock sepsis could theoretically impair perfusion or immunity [^116ehWiJ] [^113fdCKm].

> Next, I should review the methylene blue evidence. The SHOCKEM-Blue RCT enrolled patients with septic shock within 24 hours of norepinephrine initiation and found earlier vasopressor discontinuation, more vasopressor-free days, and shorter ICU and hospital length of stay with 100 mg daily infusions for 3 days; mortality was similar and no serious adverse effects were reported, though blinding was imperfect due to urine discoloration [^114naJhP] [^111JuVYw] [^1135b6Ne]. Earlier small RCTs and physiologic studies show hemodynamic improvements with methylene blue, but they did not establish mortality benefit and were not designed for pre-hypotension sepsis [^1127Mv32] [^116mXwi4]. Let me consider dosing signals: bolus plus infusion strategies have been associated with better outcomes in observational cohorts, and a recent cancer-patient RCT suggested a 4 mg/kg bolus may confer a survival signal, but this remains hypothesis-generating and not generalizable to pre-hypotension sepsis [^113ABE6r] [^116jpqtH] [^111uBn4A].

> Now, I should review hydroxocobalamin. The only septic shock RCT to date is a small, single-center pilot showing reduced vasopressor requirements and lower plasma hydrogen sulfide after a single 5 g dose; feasibility was established, but clinical outcomes and safety in broader sepsis populations remain uncertain [^115hRipN]. Most of the signal for hydroxocobalamin comes from perioperative vasoplegia after cardiopulmonary bypass, where retrospective and meta-analytic data suggest hemodynamic improvements versus methylene blue in some analyses, but again, this is not pre-hypotension sepsis and evidence quality is limited [^1142wUkd] [^116zVUPK] [^1124cgqp]. I should double-check safety: hydroxocobalamin can cause chromaturia, infusion reactions, and may interfere with dialysis equipment; there is also a case report of delayed methemoglobinemia after hydroxocobalamin, so vigilance is warranted even though this is not a typical effect [^115gu8cj] [^1128DkUx].

> Hold on, I should verify guideline positions. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends early recognition of sepsis, rapid antibiotics, fluids, and norepinephrine for persistent hypotension; it does not recommend preemptive methylene blue or hydroxocobalamin, and it advises against routine IV vitamin C, underscoring a conservative stance toward unproven adjuncts in sepsis care [^1144Mm1K] [^114i4mJV] [^116GYDgH]. Authoritative reviews caution that methylene blue remains investigational and should not be used routinely until larger multicenter trials confirm benefit, reinforcing that preemptive use is unsupported [^1144Mm1K] [^114i4mJV].

> I need to ensure safety and contraindications are front and center. Methylene blue is contraindicated in G6PD deficiency and can precipitate serotonin toxicity in patients on serotonergic agents; it can cause dose-related methemoglobinemia and discoloration that complicates monitoring, and dose ceilings around 1–2 mg/kg are advised in renal impairment, which would complicate preemptive broad use in undifferentiated sepsis [^113384oF] [^1134nkof] [^116RqShi]. Hydroxocobalamin has no established dosing guidance for vasoplegia, carries risks of infusion reactions and equipment interference, and should be avoided in cobalt hypersensitivity, again arguing against routine preemptive administration [^115gu8cj] [^113J6Jhi].

> Let me synthesize. The balance of evidence shows signal for methylene blue as an early adjunct in septic shock to reduce vasopressor exposure and length of stay, but no proven mortality benefit and no data in pre-hypotension sepsis; hydroxocobalamin has even less evidence in sepsis and remains experimental for vasoplegia. Preemptive use risks blocking beneficial NO signaling, exposing patients to adverse effects, and diverting attention from guideline-concordant care without proven benefit. Therefore, I should conclude that neither methylene blue nor hydroxocobalamin should be started in most patients with sepsis before hypotension sets in outside of a clinical trial [^114naJhP] [^115hRipN] [^1144Mm1K].

> But wait, what if we are missing an early window of opportunity? The SHOCKEM-Blue trial's "early" initiation was within 24 hours of norepinephrine, not before vasopressors, and subgroup or mechanistic signals suggesting earlier administration could help remain speculative; until a rigorously designed RCT tests true preemptive use in high-risk sepsis, routine preemptive therapy is not justified [^114naJhP] [^111JuVYw]. I should confirm that ongoing trials are addressing timing and patient selection; until then, best practice is to adhere to sepsis bundles and reserve NO-pathway modulators for established vasodilatory shock when indicated [^114i4mJV].

> Practically, I need to ensure we prioritize early recognition, source control, antibiotics, appropriate fluid resuscitation, and timely norepinephrine for persistent hypotension; consider methylene blue or hydroxocobalamin only as rescue adjuncts in refractory vasodilatory shock after vasopressin and within institutional protocols, with attention to contraindications and monitoring for adverse effects. If a patient with sepsis is deteriorating despite guideline-concordant care, a trial of methylene blue within 24 hours of shock onset may be reasonable in an ICU setting, but preemptive use before hypotension remains investigational and should be limited to trials [^114i4mJV] [^114naJhP] [^113384oF].

---

Routine use of methylene blue or hydroxocobalamin before hypotension in sepsis is **not supported by current evidence** or guidelines [^116GYDgH]. Both agents are reserved for **refractory vasodilatory shock** [^1144Mm1K] after standard therapy (fluids, norepinephrine, vasopressin) fails [^113hBNAL]. Methylene blue has modest, short-term hemodynamic benefits in septic shock [^1127Mv32] but no proven mortality reduction [^114i4mJV]; hydroxocobalamin has limited data and is not standard care [^112aGTvA] [^114jKqxB]. Early use may cause harm by impairing microcirculation or immune function, so they should not be given preemptively [^116ehWiJ] [^113fdCKm].

## Mechanisms of action and theoretical rationale

Key characteristics:

| **Aspect** | **Methylene blue** | **Hydroxocobalamin** |
|-|-|-|
| Mechanism | Inhibits soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and nitric oxide (NO) signaling, restoring vascular tone in vasodilatory shock [^113384oF] | Scavenges NO and hydrogen sulfide (H2S), potential vasodilators in septic shock [^115gu8cj] |
| Rationale | Excess NO drives hypotension in septic shock; MB's downstream blockade may preserve microcirculatory NO while correcting macrovascular tone [^1173T1Cr] | H2S accumulation contributes to vasoplegia; hydroxocobalamin may restore tone by neutralizing H2S [^115hRipN] |
| Limitations | Non-selective effects may impair microcirculation and immune function; safety concerns include methemoglobinemia and serotonin toxicity [^113384oF] | Evidence is limited; renal effects (e.g. oxalate nephropathy) and high cost limit routine use [^115gu8cj] [^1124cgqp] |

## Clinical evidence for preemptive use

### Methylene blue

Evidence is limited to small RCTs and observational studies in **established septic shock** [^114naJhP]; no trials test use before hypotension. Benefits include reduced vasopressor duration and improved MAP, but **no mortality benefit** is proven [^114naJhP] [^114i4mJV]. Risks include methemoglobinemia, serotonin toxicity, and impaired microcirculation [^113384oF].

---

### Hydroxocobalamin

Evidence consists of a small pilot RCT in septic shock and case series in perioperative vasoplegia; no studies address **pre-hypotension sepsis** [^115hRipN] [^1124cgqp]. Hemodynamic improvements have been observed, but clinical outcomes remain uncertain [^114jKqxB]. Potential harms include renal effects and high cost [^115gu8cj] [^1124cgqp].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines (SSC 2021) recommend norepinephrine as **first-line vasopressor**, with vasopressin as adjunct; methylene blue and hydroxocobalamin are not recommended preemptively [^notfound]. Expert consensus supports considering these agents only in **refractory vasodilatory shock** after standard therapy fails [^112aGTvA] [^113hBNAL].

---

## Potential risks and unintended consequences

Preemptive use may cause:

- **Microcirculatory impairment**: Over-inhibition of NO can worsen tissue perfusion [^113NfpTP].

- **Immune dysfunction**: NO is critical for host defense; early blockade may impair immunity [^113fdCKm].

- **Adverse effects**: Methemoglobinemia, serotonin toxicity, renal effects, and cost [^113384oF] [^115gu8cj] [^112aGTvA].

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

Ongoing studies aim to define timing, dosing, and patient selection for **methylene blue**; results are pending [^116Zh8jA]. For **hydroxocobalamin**, larger RCTs are needed to clarify its role and safety in septic shock [^114jKqxB].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Routine preemptive use of methylene blue or hydroxocobalamin in sepsis without hypotension is **not supported** by evidence or guidelines [^1144Mm1K] [^114jKqxB]. Both should be reserved for **refractory vasodilatory shock** after standard therapy fails. Clinicians should prioritize early antibiotics, fluids, and norepinephrine, and monitor for adverse effects if adjuncts are used [^1118g574].

### Hydroxocobalamin for vasodilatory hypotension in shock: a systematic review with meta-analysis for comparison to methylene blue [^114jKqxB]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Hydroxocobalamin inhibits nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation, and has been used in settings of refractory shock. However, its effectiveness and role in treating hypotension remain unclear. The authors systematically searched Ovid Medline, Embase, EBM Reviews, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection for clinical studies reporting on adult persons who received hydroxocobalamin for vasodilatory shock. A meta-analysis was performed with random-effects models comparing the hemodynamic effects of hydroxocobalamin to methylene blue. The Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions tool was used to assess the risk of bias. A total of 24 studies were identified and comprised mainly of case reports (n = 12), case series (n = 9), and 3 cohort studies. Hydroxocobalamin was applied mainly for cardiac surgery vasoplegia, but also was reported in the settings of liver transplantation, septic shock, drug-induced hypotension, and noncardiac postoperative vasoplegia. In the pooled analysis, hydroxocobalamin was associated with a higher mean arterial pressure (MAP) at 1 hour than methylene blue (mean difference 7.80, 95% CI 2.63–12.98). There were no significant differences in change in MAP (mean difference -4.57, 95% CI -16.05 to 6.91) or vasopressor dosage (mean difference -0.03, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.06) at 1 hour compared to baseline between hydroxocobalamin and methylene blue. Mortality was also similar (odds ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.42–2.03). The evidence supporting the use of hydroxocobalamin for shock is limited to anecdotal reports and a few cohort studies. Hydroxocobalamin appears to positively affect hemodynamics in shock, albeit similar to methylene blue.

Nitric oxide inhibitors

Given these unwanted consequences of adrenergic agent use and the possible advantages of other molecules, the terms decatecholaminization, catecholamine sparing, and multimodal vasopressor strategy have emerged, which consider the place of non-adrenergic vasopressors in the management of septic shock. Nitric oxide (NO) inhibitors, vasopressin and its analogs, high-dose intravenous hydroxocobalamin, and angiotensin II are among the principal non-adrenergic agents that have been proposed in this context. Because of the complex role of NO in sepsis (see later), administration of NO donors has also been suggested, and shown to improve microcirculatory perfusion, reduce platelet aggregation and microthrombus formation, reduce endothelial permeability and improve tissue perfusion in septic shock. In this review, however, we will focus on the pros and cons of NO inhibitors, particularly methylene blue (MB).

In septic shock, there is significant activation of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), mostly in response to endotoxin and pro-inflammatory cytokines. NO is the main driver of vasodilation leading to hypotension and a decreased response to vasoconstrictors. NO regulates leukocyte activity and is also toxic to most bacteria. iNOS is the major source of NO production in sepsis, mainly in the cytoplasm of cells under pro-inflammatory stress, higher by far than the NO synthesis coming from the constitutive isoforms of the enzyme. At the cellular level, NO also behaves as a free radical, interacts with other free radicals to form secondary metabolites such as peroxynitrite (ONOO⁻), and via similar reactions it can inhibit lipid oxidation products and act as an antioxidant; this free radical scavenging action reduces tissue injury. At the mitochondrial level, NO takes part in important processes including modulation of the mitochondrial electron transport chain.

### High-dose IV hydroxocobalamin (vitamin B12) in septic shock: a double-blind, allocation-concealed, placebo-controlled single-center pilot randomized controlled trial (the intravenous hydroxocobalamin in septic shock trial) [^115hRipN]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Elevated hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) contributes to vasodilatation and hypotension in septic shock, and traditional therapies do not target this pathophysiologic mechanism. High-dose IV hydroxocobalamin scavenges and prevents H₂S formation, which may restore vascular tone and may accentuate recovery. No experimental human studies have tested high-dose IV hydroxocobalamin in adults with septic shock.

Research Question

In adults with septic shock, is comparing high-dose IV hydroxocobalamin with placebo feasible?

Study Design and Methods

We conducted a phase 2 single-center, double-blind, allocation-concealed, placebo-controlled, parallel-group pilot randomized controlled trial comparing high-dose IV hydroxocobalamin with placebo in critically ill adults with septic shock. Patients meeting Sepsis 3 criteria were randomized 1:1 to receive a single 5-g dose of high-dose IV hydroxocobalamin or equivalent volume 0.9% saline solution as placebo. The primary outcome was study feasibility (enrollment rate, clinical and laboratory compliance rate, and contamination rate). Secondary outcomes included between-group differences in plasma H 2 S concentrations and vasopressor dose before and after infusion.

Results

Twenty patients were enrolled over 19 months, establishing an enrollment rate of 1.05 patients per month. Protocol adherence rates were 100% with zero contamination. In the high-dose IV hydroxocobalamin group, compared to placebo, there was a greater reduction in vasopressor dose between randomization and postinfusion (-36% vs 4%, P < .001) and randomization and 3-h postinfusion (-28% vs 10%, P = 0.019). In the high-dose IV hydroxocobalamin group, the plasma H₂S level was reduced over 45 mins by -0.80 ± 1.73 μM, as compared with -0.21 ± 0.64 μM in the placebo group (P = 0.3).

Interpretation

This pilot trial established favorable feasibility metrics. Consistent with the proposed mechanism of benefit, high-dose IV hydroxocobalamin compared with placebo was associated with reduced vasopressor dose and H₂S levels at all time points and without serious adverse events. These data provide the first proof of concept for feasibility of delivering high-dose IV hydroxocobalamin in septic shock.

Conclusions

In conclusion, early adjunctive MB administration reduced vasopressor duration, cumulative fluid balance, and ICU and hospital length of stay among patients with septic shock, as compared with placebo. There were no severe adverse effects related to its use. Our results support the continuous research of MB as an early adjunctive therapy in patients with septic shock to confirm the potential benefit in larger multicenter randomized clinical trials.

### Administration of methylene blue in septic shock: pros and cons [^115VyE6Y]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a common condition that affects millions of people around the world every year. Septic shock, the most severe form of sepsis, is associated with mortality rates of 35 to 50%. Septic shock typically requires the administration of vasopressors, and this treatment should be started without delay to avoid severe hypotension.

In current clinical practice, adrenergic agents are used as the first line vasopressors, acting to rapidly increase vascular tone and blood pressure (through α-1 adrenergic receptors). In addition, they have a short half-life, which facilitates dose titration. However, catecholamines have potential adverse effects. Adrenergic agents can induce myocardial ischemia and decrease regional blood flow; they also have metabolic effects, including causing hyperglycemia and increased cellular metabolism that can participate in the development of hyperlactatemia, and can exert immunomodulating effects. Norepinephrine is preferred as the first-choice vasopressor agent, because of its balanced pharmacodynamic profile with potent α-1 adrenergic receptor stimulation and modest β-1 adrenergic effects that can help to maintain cardiac output. Nevertheless, excessive vasoconstriction may increase ventricular afterload thus impairing right and left ventricular function, interfere with regional blood flow distribution, and alter the microcirculation.

### Methylene blue for vasodilatory shock in the intensive care unit: a retrospective, observational study [^113P5kk6]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Limitations of this study include the retrospective nature, the single-institution experience, and the non-standardized approach to therapy. Additionally, the diagnosis of vasoplegia was made clinically with the etiology defined by the care team. There was not universal monitoring for cardiac index to delineate normal versus hyperdynamic cardiac physiology. There are no consensus guidelines or defined institutional practices regarding timing or clinical triggers for MB administration, therefore, the use of MB was physician dependent. The duration of vasoplegia and inotropic support prior to the administration of MB was not uniform and could theoretically play a role in the survival benefit among MB responders. However, the non-significant difference of SOFA score between MB responders and non-responders suggests a similar shock severity prior to treatment. Finally, the use of additional non-adrenergic treatments for vasoplegia including corticosteroids, hydroxocobalamin, and angiotensin-II were not recorded in this dataset, though hydroxocobalamin is not used in our institution outside of the cardiac surgical realm.

The dosing and administration of MB was not uniform and it may be that a higher dose of MB (2–3 mg/kg) with a higher infusion rate (0.5 mg/kg/hr) could have had a more pronounced hemodynamic effect. Additionally, the amount of fluid resuscitation could have confounded the results as the non-responders received significantly less resuscitation than the responders. The specific resuscitation fluid was also not standardized or documented in this dataset and patients in either group may have received a combination of crystalloid, colloid, and/or blood products at the discretion of the care team.

Additionally, a formal power analysis could not be performed given that this was a retrospective study. The subgroup analysis of CRRT patients is suggestive of a population that may have particular benefit from MB, however, the sample size is small and further research is required to verify this finding.

### Early adjunctive methylene blue in patients with septic shock: a randomized controlled trial [^111JuVYw]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Some limitations should be acknowledged. First, this was a single-center study. As a one of the largest reference centers in Mexico, it is common that our patients have a relatively short ICU/hospital stance compared to other larger multicenter trials; as long as there is no need for strictly needed care, persistent organ failure or pending surgery/procedure, patients are discharged as rapidly as possible and followed up through outpatient visits. Thus, a different effect of MB on length of stay in other settings cannot be ruled out. Second, most patients were managed in other departments at the moment of septic shock identification before admission to ICU, the lack of trained healthcare staff and resources (ultrasound, invasive monitoring) might have led to sub-optimal resuscitation and worse patients' status, as shown by the relatively higher doses of norepinephrine compared to other larger RCTs of patients with septic shock. Therefore, although the time from enrollment to intervention was negligible, an improved response to MB at an earlier phase of the disease cannot be ruled out, as it has been suggested that MB could be more effective within an early "window of opportunity". Third, this trial took many years to complete as the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the recruitment rate, and the SSC guidelines were updated while this study was still ongoing. However, it is worth to note that the changes were few, and the resuscitation protocol in our study was still consistent with the new guidelines. For instance, we did not aim for a dose of 30 ml/kg of IV crystalloids at initial resuscitation, and this recommendation was downgraded; we also used IV corticosteroids in all patients while this recommendation was upgraded. Fourth, we did not measure cytokine or nitrate/nitrite serum levels to confirm the mechanism of the effects of MB, but this should not distract from the pragmatic finding that MB reduced vasopressor duration, and ICU and hospital length of stay. Fifth, as we excluded patients with COVID-19, the benefit of MB still needs to be confirmed for this subgroup in future RCTs. Sixth, despite the effort to maintain blinding regarding allocation, the high incidence of urine discoloration and continuous assessment of methemoglobin levels through co-oximetry could have led to identification of group assignment, therefore, a biased adjustment of vasopressors by clinicians cannot be ruled-out. Nonetheless, the similar MAP during the first 4 days (Fig. 2) and less fluid administration suggests that if present, this bias was minimal. Lastly, the difference in mortality trends between groups should be interpreted cautiously, as this study was underpowered to draw any conclusion on this outcome, and larger studies should confirm these results.

### Early adjunctive methylene blue in patients with septic shock: a randomized controlled trial [^111NrYh2]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Methylene blue (MB) has been tested as a rescue therapy for patients with refractory septic shock. However, there is a lack of evidence on MB as an adjuvant therapy, its' optimal timing, dosing and safety profile. We aimed to assess whether early adjunctive MB can reduce time to vasopressor discontinuation in patients with septic shock.

Methods

In this single-center randomized controlled trial, we assigned patients with septic shock according to Sepsis-3 criteria to MB or placebo. Primary outcome was time to vasopressor discontinuation at 28 days. Secondary outcomes included vasopressor-free days at 28 days, days on mechanical ventilator, length of stay in ICU and hospital, and mortality at 28 days.

Results

Among 91 randomized patients, forty-five were assigned to MB and 46 to placebo. The MB group had a shorter time to vasopressor discontinuation (69 h [IQR 59–83] vs 94 h [IQR 74–141]; p < 0.001), one more day of vasopressor-free days at day 28 (p = 0.008), a shorter ICU length of stay by 1.5 days (p = 0.039) and shorter hospital length of stay by 2.7 days (p = 0.027) compared to patients in the control group. Days on mechanical ventilator and mortality were similar. There were no serious adverse effects related to MB administration.

Conclusion

In patients with septic shock, MB initiated within 24 h reduced time to vasopressor discontinuation and increased vasopressor-free days at 28 days. It also reduced length of stay in ICU and hospital without adverse effects. Our study supports further research regarding MB in larger randomized clinical trials.

Materials and methods

Trial design and oversight

We conducted an investigator-initiated, parallel, double blinded, randomized controlled trial at an academic reference center in Mexico, in a medical-surgical intensive care unit (ICU). The study was approved by the institutional review board "Comité de Ética en Investigación Hospital Civil Fray Antonio Alcalde" (HCG/CEI-0252/17) and performed in accordance with the ethical standards as laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04446871) after inclusion of 17 patients. Informed consent was obtained from all patients or decision makers.

Patients

Patients aged ≥ 18 years with septic shock as defined by Sepsis-3 criteria (highly suspected or confirmed infection, requiring norepinephrine to maintain a MAP ≥ 65 mmHg, and serum lactate > 2 mmol/L after adequate fluid resuscitation) were assessed for eligibility.

Exclusion criteria included > 24 h since initiation of norepinephrine, pregnancy, high probability of death within 48 h, concurrent hemorrhagic, obstructive or hypovolemic shock, pending damage control surgery, major burn injury, personal or familiar history of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, allergy to methylene blue, phenothiazines, or food dyes, recent intake (4-weeks) of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, and refusal of the patient or decision maker to participate. During the beginning of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, data safety monitoring board did not allow us to recruit patients with this diagnosis, due to the unknown pathophysiologic underpinnings and the uncertainties about response to MB.

Randomization, intervention and measurements

After signing informed consent, patients were randomly assigned to receive MB using a predetermined randomization sequence prepared in sealed opaque envelopes. The sequence was generated by computer with a 1:1 allocation ratio, using permuted blocks with a size of 4. Critical care physicians were responsible for assignment of intervention. Patients, clinicians, investigators and outcome assessors were blinded to the treatment received.

Patients assigned to MB group received an intravenous (IV) infusion of 100 mg of MB in 500 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution over 6 h once daily for a total of 3 doses. Patients assigned to control group received the same dose of 500 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride without MB. In order to avoid visual identification of the infusion, all infusion bags and polyvinylchloride lines were prepared at central pharmacy with opaque envelopes.

### Administration of methylene blue in septic shock: pros and cons [^1144Mm1K]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Septic shock typically requires the administration of vasopressors. Adrenergic agents remain the first choice, namely norepinephrine. However, their use to counteract life-threatening hypotension comes with potential adverse effects, so that non-adrenergic vasopressors may also be considered. The use of agents that act through different mechanisms may also provide an advantage. Nitric oxide (NO) is the main driver of the vasodilation that leads to hypotension in septic shock, so several agents have been tested to counteract its effects. The use of non-selective NO synthase inhibitors has been of questionable benefit. Methylene blue, an inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase, an important enzyme involved in the NO signaling pathway in the vascular smooth muscle cell, has also been proposed. However, more than 25 years since the first clinical evaluation of MB administration in septic shock, the safety and benefits of its use are still not fully established, and it should not be used routinely in clinical practice until further evidence of its efficacy is available.

### Non-adrenergic vasopressors for vasodilatory shock or perioperative vasoplegia: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114PPAqS]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was mortality at the longest available follow-up, given that mortality is the most frequently reported patient-important primary outcome in critical care RCTs. Secondary outcomes included renal replacement therapy (RRT), days of mechanical ventilation, days of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, days of hospital stay, atrial fibrillation, vasopressor-free days at day 28, and dose of noradrenaline. Dose of noradrenaline refers to the noradrenaline equivalent dose observed at the longest follow-up available.

Statistical analysis

Initially, we categorized all the included RCTs into one of three distinct groups — septic shock, cardiac surgery, or non-cardiac surgery — based on the majority population in each study. Meta-analysis was performed separately for these three groups. Subgroup analysis was conducted according to type of non-adrenergic agents (vasopressin, terlipressin, selepressin, angiotensin II, methylene blue, and hydroxocobalamin), comparator (placebo and adrenergic agents), baseline vasopressor dose (above or below the median value in septic shock), exclusion of studies assessing nitric oxide scavengers (methylene blue and hydroxocobalamin), and studies with overall low risk of bias. We also performed the following sensitivity analyses for the primary outcome: timing of assessment (< 28 days, 28 or 30 days, and > 30 days), exclusion of a study using dopamine as control treatment, exclusion of studies using selepressin as the intervention, timing of administration (first-line versus second- or third-line therapy), studies published in high-impact journals (the complete journal selection is detailed in the Table S1), and studies published before versus after 2014.

Throughout this study, we calculated individual and pooled effects estimate (risk ratio [RR] for binary variables and mean difference [MD] or standardized mean difference [SMD] for continuous variables) with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a Mantel–Haenszel random-effects model for all the outcomes assuming heterogeneity of treatment effects due to clinical heterogeneity among studies. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I² statistics, and publication bias was evaluated by visual inspection of funnel plots. We used Review Manager 5.4 and considered two-sided p values < 0.05 statistically significant.

To assess the possible effect modification for mortality by baseline vasopressor dose, we performed a meta-regression analysis using a mixed-effects model. A noradrenaline equivalent score was used to calculate the total vasopressor dose. The analysis was performed using R 4.0.1.

Purpose

Methylene blue (MB) has been tested as a rescue therapy for patients with refractory septic shock. However, there is a lack of evidence on MB as an adjuvant therapy, its' optimal timing, dosing and safety profile. We aimed to assess whether early adjunctive MB can reduce time to vasopressor discontinuation in patients with septic shock.

Methods

In this single-center randomized controlled trial, we assigned patients with septic shock according to Sepsis-3 criteria to MB or placebo. Primary outcome was time to vasopressor discontinuation at 28 days. Secondary outcomes included vasopressor-free days at 28 days, days on mechanical ventilator, length of stay in ICU and hospital, and mortality at 28 days.

Results

Among 91 randomized patients, forty-five were assigned to MB and 46 to placebo. The MB group had a shorter time to vasopressor discontinuation (69 h [IQR 59–83] vs 94 h [IQR 74–141]; p < 0.001), one more day of vasopressor-free days at day 28 (p = 0.008), a shorter ICU length of stay by 1.5 days (p = 0.039) and shorter hospital length of stay by 2.7 days (p = 0.027) compared to patients in the control group. Days on mechanical ventilator and mortality were similar. There were no serious adverse effects related to MB administration.

Conclusion

In patients with septic shock, MB initiated within 24 h reduced time to vasopressor discontinuation and increased vasopressor-free days at 28 days. It also reduced length of stay in ICU and hospital without adverse effects. Our study supports further research regarding MB in larger randomized clinical trials.

### Early adjunctive methylene blue in patients with septic shock: a randomized controlled trial [^112cS4s5]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

The study SHOCKEM-Blue was published by Miguel Ibarra-Estrada and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Crit Care. This study is related to the following diseases: Sepsis and septic shock. In the SHOCKEM-Blue study, the trial question was: what is the role of early adjunctive methylene blue in patients with septic shock? In the SHOCKEM-Blue study, the study design was: single center, double blinded, RCT. In the SHOCKEM-Blue study, the population was: 91 patients (36 female, 55 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with septic shock according to Sepsis-3 criteria. The key exclusion criteria were > 24 hours since initiation of norepinephrine; pregnancy; high probability of death within 48 hours; concurrent hemorrhagic, obstructive or hypovolemic shock; pending damage control surgery; major burn injury. In the SHOCKEM-Blue study, the interventions were: n = 45 methylene blue (intravenous infusion at a dose of 100 mg in 500 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution for 6 hours once a day for a total of 3 doses) n = 46 placebo (intravenous infusion of 500 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution for 6 hours once a day for a total of 3 doses). In the SHOCKEM-Blue study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in time to discontinuation of vasopressors at day 28 (69 hours vs. 94 hours; AD -25 hours, 95% CI -39.83 to -10.17). In the SHOCKEM-Blue study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in median vasopressor-free days at 28 days (23.9 days vs. 19.5 days; MD 4.4, 95% CI 1.15 to 7.65) Significant decrease in hospital length of stay (9 days vs. 10.5 days; AD -1.5 days, 95% CI -2.83 to -0.17) No significant difference in death at day 28 (33% vs. 46%; RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.05). In the SHOCKEM-Blue study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in ejection fraction, serum creatinine, bilirubin, and liver aminotransferases. significant difference in methemoglobin saturation (2.9% vs. 0.5%). In the SHOCKEM-Blue study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with septic shock according to Sepsis-3 criteria, methylene blue was superior to placebo with respect to time to discontinuation of vasopressors at day 28.

### Hydroxocobalamin versus methylene blue for treatment of vasoplegic shock following cardiopulmonary bypass: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1142wUkd]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To summarize the evidence of the hemodynamic effects and vasopressor requirements of adult cardiac surgery patients with vasoplegic shock treated with hydroxocobalamin or methylene blue.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Setting

Multi-institutional.

Participants

Adult cardiac surgery patients with vasoplegic shock.

Interventions

Administration of hydroxocobalamin or methylene blue.

Measurements and Main Results

A total of 263 patients in four retrospective observational studies were included in a pooled analysis. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome, vasopressor requirement at 1 hour (mean difference [MD]: 0.00 mcg/kg/min norepinephrine equivalent [NEE], 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.09 to 0.08). Hydroxocobalamin was associated with a significant improvement in mean arterial pressure at 1 hour (MD: 5.30 mmHg, 95% CI: 2.98 to 7.62), total vasopressor dose at 1 hour (MD: -0.13 mcg/kg/min NEE, 95% CI: -0.25 to -0.01), total vasopressor at 6 hours (MD: -0.15 mcg/kg/min NEE, 95% CI: -0.21 to -0.08). No differences were observed in systemic vascular resistance or mortality between groups. Three studies were deemed at moderate risk of bias and one at serious risk.

Conclusions

Hydroxocobalamin has been shown to have a beneficial effect on hemodynamics and vasopressor requirements in vasoplegic cardiac surgery patients compared with methylene blue, although evidence is limited, and further well-powered randomized controlled trials are required.

### Early adjunctive methylene blue in patients with septic shock: a randomized controlled trial [^1173T1Cr]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this single-center RCT, we found that adjunctive MB administered within 24 h of septic shock diagnosis reduced time to vasopressor discontinuation, and importantly, no severe adverse effects were detected. The clinical implications of our results might shift the current understanding of MB as a rescue therapy to an adjunctive one at earlier stages of the disease. Due to its safety profile, wider availability and lower cost than other catecholamine-sparing agents, MB could emerge as a viable therapy within a multimodal strategy to maintain MAP and improve tissue perfusion, while decreasing the risk of high-dose vasopressors.

To our knowledge, this is the largest RCT comparing MB vs placebo in patients with septic shock. In the study by Kirov et al. in 2001, they randomized 20 patients with septic shock to placebo or a bolus injection of 2 mg/kg of MB, followed by a continuous 4-h infusion to a total dose of 5.75 mg/kg, and followed patients up to 24 h. Although more patients died in the control group (7 vs 3) and duration of vasopressor support was shorter in MB group (71 h vs 93 h), these differences were not significant. In 2002, Memis et al. randomized 30 patients with septic shock to placebo or an infusion of MB at 3 mg/kg over 6 h, with a follow-up of 48 h. They found no differences in cytokine levels or any other relevant outcome; nonetheless, they reported a significant but transient increase in MAP in patients of MB group. Shortly after publication of these 2 promising studies, a large phase III multicenter RCT which included 797 patients with septic shock was published. López et al. randomized patients to placebo or the NOS inhibitor N (G)-methyl-L-arginine hydrochloride (546C88). The study was terminated early due to a significant increase by 10% in mortality of cardiovascular cause at 28 days. This seems to have halted the enthusiasm in research about NO inhibition; however, it is important to note that this molecule is non-selective, inhibiting both inducible and constitutive isoforms of NOS (unlike MB which selectively inhibits the inducible form). Sparing the constitutive isoform is important to maintain homeostasis even in sepsis; for instance, to improve microcirculatory flow, increase blood flow to ischemic areas, scavenge oxygen-free radicals, and enhance microbial killing by macrophages. It has been postulated that a global inhibition of NO is associated with detrimental effects in sepsis that can result in accelerated organ damage; thus, a more downstream inhibition within the NO cascade as provided by MB could be a better approach. In line with these assumptions, MB was associated with a reduction in mortality in a recent systematic review and meta-analysis pooling observational and RCT studies.

Regarding potential adverse effects, two prior small non-randomized studies suggested that MB could induce worsening of oxygenation due to pulmonary vasoconstriction. Gachot et al. reported a significant decrease of PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio from 229 to 162 after a 3 mg/kg bolus of MB over 10 min, and Weingartner et al. found a decrease of PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio from 168 to 132 after a dose of 4 mg/kg over 4 h; however, these detrimental effects were transient and not confirmed by other RCTs including ours, as most of our patients had ARDS diagnosis and the change in PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio and days of mechanical ventilation were similar between groups after treatment. Moreover, it is known that unlike the beneficial effects, the toxic profile of MB is dose related, so the rate/dose used in those non-randomized studies could have been unsafe. A dose of 1 mg/kg has been shown to be enough to improve MAP, left ventricular function and tissue oxygenation in human septic shock, while ≥ 7 mg/kg might compromise splanchnic perfusion and adverse effects are rarely present under 2 mg/kg. Besides, continuous prolonged infusion of MB may lead to higher cumulative doses, which might be toxic and result in methemoglobinemia; this is the pragmatic reason why we decided to administer a fixed dose of 100 mg vials (available presentation at our institution) assuming that most patients would receive at least 1 mg/kg while avoiding high cumulative doses. This schedule resulted in a total cumulative dose of 3.6 mg/kg over 54 h, which was sufficient to reduce vasopressor support with no detrimental effects in pulmonary, kidney, cardiac or liver function. Although methemoglobin levels were significantly higher in patients of MB, this elevation was far from the clinically relevant threshold of 10%.

### Administration of methylene blue in septic shock: pros and cons [^114i4mJV]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The potential benefits of using agents that act on NO pathways in septic shock is still unclear. Although most evidence comes from small studies and remains largely anecdotal, the use of non-selective NO inhibitors (e.g. L-NMMA and L-NNA) in septic shock has not been shown to provide any substantial benefit in patients with septic shock and use of an iNOS inhibitor increased mortality. MB clearly increases vascular tone and MAP, and seems to maintain cardiac contractility, but without evidence of an increase in cellular oxygen availability. Apart from a consistent reduction in vasopressor requirements with the use of MB, no significant clinically relevant benefit has been demonstrated. The decreased doses of adrenergic agents may be beneficial by reducing the unwanted adverse effects of these agents, but this remains hypothetical as surrogate outcomes, such as time to shock reversal and adverse effect profiles, have not been included in most studies. To elucidate the best timing, dosage, and administration strategy for MB in septic shock patients and finally clarify whether the use of MB really has beneficial or detrimental clinically relevant effects (Table 1), a large multicenter randomized controlled trial should be considered, perhaps using the same protocol as that in the recent study by Ibarra-Estrada et al. in which MB administration appeared safe and effective. Despite some positive findings in recent studies, the significant limitations of the available data, given the small sample sizes and heterogeneity, warrant further assessment of safety and some consistent evidence of advantageous clinical benefit before routine use of MB in septic shock can be considered.

### Hydroxocobalamin versus methylene blue for the treatment of vasoplegic shock associated with cardiopulmonary bypass [^116zVUPK]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To compare changes in vasopressor requirements and hemodynamic responses after hydroxocobalamin or methylene blue administration for vasoplegic shock (VS).

Design

Retrospective cohort analysis.

Setting

Single-center, academic medical center.

Patients

Cardiothoracic surgery adult patients.

Interventions

Hydroxocobalamin or methylene blue.

Measurements

The primary outcome was a change in vasopressor requirements over the first 24 hours (1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours) after hydroxocobalamin or methylene blue initiation. Secondary outcomes included changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP), systemic vascular resistance, and lactate.

Main Results

A total of 120 adult patients who received hydroxocobalamin (n = 77) or methylene blue (n = 43) were included. Vasopressor requirements at baseline were 0.34 µg/kg/min (95% CI 0.28–0.4) norepinephrine equivalent (NEE) in the hydroxocobalamin group, and 0.59 µg/kg/min (95% CI 0.52–0.66) NEE in the methylene blue group; p < 0.001. Vasopressor requirements decreased significantly at each time point within each group (hour 1 mean [95% CI] NEE, hydroxocobalamin 0.27 µg/kg/min [0.21–0.33]; methylene blue 0.44 µg/kg/min [0.38–0.51]; p < 0.001). The mean MAP at baseline was 65 mmHg (95% CI 63–67) in the hydroxocobalamin group, and 57 mmHg (95% CI 54–59) in the methylene blue group; p < 0.001. The mean MAP increased significantly from baseline at each time point within each group (hour 1 mean [95% CI] hydroxocobalamin 73 mmHg [71–75]; methylene blue 67 mmHg [65–70]; p < 0.001). After adjusting for baseline characteristics, a significantly greater reduction in vasopressor requirements and an increase in MAP were noted in the hydroxocobalamin group compared with the methylene blue group.

Conclusions

Hydroxocobalamin was associated with a greater reduction in vasopressor requirements than methylene blue in treating VS associated with cardiopulmonary bypass.

### Early adjunctive methylene blue in patients with septic shock: a randomized controlled trial [^1118g574]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a host's dysregulated response to an infection, characterized by endothelial dysfunction leading to increased vascular permeability, abnormal nitric oxide (NO) metabolism, vasodilation, among other systemic derangements. Along with antibiotics, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) Guidelines recommend early fluid resuscitation as a cornerstone of management; however, only half of the patients respond to fluid challenges and their hemodynamic effects are transient, sometimes lasting as short as 10 min; so, vasopressors are needed to improve organ perfusion. Norepinephrine is the first-choice, but high doses increase the risk of adverse effects such as tachyarrhythmia, myocardial dysfunction, peripheral ischemia, and even immunosuppression. Therefore, a combination of agents targeting different systems involved in blood pressure regulation and endothelial function has been recently proposed. This "multimodal strategy" could help to restore tissue perfusion while decreasing the potential toxicity of single agents.

Methylene blue (MB) is a specific inhibitor of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and its downstream enzyme soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC). Through its indirect pressor effects, it has been shown to restore vasoregulation in conditions of NO upregulation. However, most of the clinical research has been performed in vasoplegia following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), another form of vasodilatory shock similar to sepsis. Despite promising results of two small randomized controlled trials (RCT) with short follow-up (≤ 48 h) performed in patients with septic shock two decades ago, the momentum to further research was shortly lost.

Based on large datasets, it is increasingly recognized that a higher exposure to catecholamine vasopressors is associated with an increased risk of multiple organ failure and death in septic shock; thus, the time of norepinephrine requirement is a justified intermediate patient-centered outcome in order to pave the way for adding catecholamine-sparing agents to a multimodal strategy. We designed this RCT to assess if early adjunctive MB administration could reduce the time to vasopressor discontinuation in patients with septic shock, as compared to placebo.

### Early adjunctive methylene blue in patients with septic shock: a randomized controlled trial [^114N5z1j]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

The most common use of MB for septic shock is reported as single infusions due to extrapolation from the predominant literature on CPB; but unlike sepsis, the systemic inflammatory insult of CPB which occurs in up to 50% of the patients is limited to a few hours. By contrast, the duration of the inflammatory insult in septic shock is less predictable, and we know that the expected duration of vasopressor requirement is of 2–3 days even in optimal conditions as in recent clinical trials. This is the reason we decided to administer MB in repeated doses. Considering that NE requirement was significantly lower in MB than in control group only after the second dose (Fig. 2), we believe our positive findings were in part due to this approach, which provided a longer timeframe of iNOS and sGC inhibition. Data from a recent large retrospective study support this assumption; Sari-Yavuz et al. studied different modes of administration of MB in critically-ill patients with shock, and they reported that the length of inhibition of the NO pathway could influence the response to MB, rather than the cumulative dose.

### Methylene blue for vasodilatory shock in the intensive care unit: a retrospective, observational study [^112aGTvA]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Vasodilatory shock is an important problem in the intensive care unit that is associated with multiple coexisting disease pathologies. Refractory vasodilatory shock, or vasoplegia, is a state of uncontrolled vasodilation thought to be chiefly mediated by dysregulation of nitric oxide (NO) and soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and likely also associated with underlying inflammation and endothelial dysregulation. NO is generated via nitric oxide synthase and results in vasodilation due to the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate production (cGMP) which subsequently mediates vascular smooth muscle relaxation. Definitions of vasoplegia vary, but most sources define it as requiring vasopressor doses ranging from above 0.2 mcg/kg/min to 0.5 mcg/kg/min of norepinephrine equivalents or more, with a cardiac index (CI) of at least 2.2 L/min/m² and difficulty maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg. The use of CI to define vasoplegia can make diagnosis difficult given the trend in less frequent use of pulmonary artery catheters.

Rescue therapy for vasoplegia refractory to catecholamines includes vasopressin, methylene blue (MB), corticosteroids, angiotensin II, ascorbic acid, and hydroxocobalamin. The routine use of these adjunct agents has not been standardized due to limited, inconsistent data and cost. Methylene blue (ProvayBlue™) inhibits endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), sGC, and cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). MB restores vascular tone and due to the selective blockade of both sGC and iNOS, and it is considered more targeted to the dysregulation of the microcirculation in the setting of NO upregulation.

We report our institutional experience with the use of intravenous MB for refractory shock in patients admitted to the intensive care unit. In accordance with the current literature, we hypothesized that (1) at least 40% of critically ill patients would respond positively to MB administration and (2) that those who responded to MB would have a survival benefit. Mortality in responders versus non-responders was assessed and a subgroup analysis in patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was also performed.

### Non-adrenergic vasopressors for vasodilatory shock or perioperative vasoplegia: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113idcV4]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Vasodilatory shock remains a clinical challenge in critically ill and perioperative patients. When fluid resuscitation alone fails to restore blood pressure, vasopressors represent the key intervention to correct hypotension. There are three major mechanisms to maintain blood pressure, i.e. the sympathetic nervous system, vasopressin system, and renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Each of them has the corresponding vasopressors (i.e. catecholamines, vasopressin and its derivatives, and angiotensin II). In addition, several vasoactive agents with distinct mechanisms of action (e.g. methylene blue and hydroxocobalamin) can also be used to restore blood pressure.

Noradrenaline is recommended as the first-line vasopressor; however, excessive exposure to catecholamines is associated with poor prognosis. Thus, the hypothesis has emerged that administration of non-adrenergic vasopressors may reduce the catecholamine burden and improve clinical outcomes. Consistent with this, a previous meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in 2015 showed potential survival benefits of non-adrenergic agents. Other meta-analyses have suggested that vasopressin and its derivatives may reduce arrhythmias in septic shock and that methylene blue might offer survival benefits in patients with septic shock and in those undergoing cardiac surgery. Moreover, angiotensin II, which became available for clinical use in 2017, has been tested in a clinical trial primarily involving septic shock patients and in two RCTs in cardiac surgical settings with promising findings. Finally, hydroxocobalamin was also tested in a recent RCT for septic shock. Given the heterogeneity of these studies in terms of patient population, comparator, type of non-adrenergic agent, and shock severity, a dedicated analysis appears desirable to account for these between-trial differences and provide an updated assessment of the outcome impact of non-adrenergic vasopressors.

Accordingly, we performed an updated systematic review and meta-analysis. We aimed to test the hypothesis that non-adrenergic vasopressors reduce mortality in adult patients receiving vasopressor therapy for vasodilatory shock or perioperative vasoplegia. To address the heterogeneity of treatment effects across different populations and different comparators, we separately analyzed studies according to patient group (septic shock, cardiac surgery, and non-cardiac surgery) and performed subgroup analyses according to the comparator (adrenergic agents or placebo).

Secondary outcomes

Patients in the MB group had 1.0 more days of vasopressor-free days at day 28 (p = 0.008). They had a lower cumulative fluid balance by 741 mL (CI 95 293–1188; p = 0.001), a shorter ICU length of stay by 1.5 days (CI 95 0.08–2.5; p = 0.039), and shorter hospital length of stay by 2.7 days (CI 95 0.3–4.6; p = 0.027) compared to patients in the control group. At proportional hazards analysis, we found a hazard ratio for shock reversal of 2.7 for patients in the MB group at 28 days (CI 95 1.5–5.0; p = 0.0007) (Fig. 3). Lactate levels within the first 3 days, days on mechanical ventilation and mortality at 28 days were similar (Table 2).

Adverse effects

The most common adverse effect was green–blue discoloration of urine in 42 of 45 (93%) patients in the MB group. Maximum methemoglobin saturation was significantly higher in patients of the MB group (2.9% [IQR 2.2–3.3] vs 0.5% [IQR 0.4–0.7]; p < 0.001). Regarding other potential adverse effects, the change in ejection fraction, PaO₂/FiO₂, serum creatinine, bilirubins and liver aminotransferases were not different between groups after the intervention (Fig. 4).

### Non-adrenergic vasopressors for vasodilatory shock or perioperative vasoplegia: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111tui3j]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Excessive exposure to adrenergic vasopressors may be harmful. Non-adrenergic vasopressors may spare adrenergic agents and potentially improve outcomes. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the efficacy of non-adrenergic vasopressors in adult patients receiving vasopressor therapy for vasodilatory shock or perioperative vasoplegia.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for RCTs comparing non-adrenergic vasopressors with adrenergic vasopressors alone or placebo in critically ill or perioperative patients. Each eligible study was categorized into septic shock, cardiac surgery, or non-cardiac surgery. Non-adrenergic vasopressors included vasopressin, terlipressin, selepressin, angiotensin II, methylene blue, and hydroxocobalamin. The primary outcome was mortality at longest follow-up. We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis. We registered the protocol in PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42024505039).

Results

Among 51 eligible RCTs totaling 5715 patients, the predominant population was septic shock in 30 studies, cardiac surgery in 11 studies, and non-cardiac surgery in 10 studies. Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials version 2 identified 17 studies as low risk of bias. In septic shock, mortality was significantly lower in the non-adrenergic group (960/2232 [43%] vs. 898/1890 [48%]; risk ratio [RR], 0.92; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.86–0.97; P = 0.03; I² = 0%), with none of the individual non-adrenergic vasopressors showing significant survival benefits. No significant mortality difference was observed in patients undergoing cardiac surgery (34/410 [8.3%] vs. 47/412 [11%]; RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.55–1.22; P = 0.32; I² = 12%) or those undergoing non-cardiac surgery (9/388 [2.3%] vs. 18/383 [4.7%]; RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.31–1.41; P = 0.28; I² = 0%).

Conclusions

Administration of non-adrenergic vasopressors was significantly associated with reduced mortality in patients with septic shock. However, no single agent achieved statistical significance in separate analyses. Although the pooled effects of non-adrenergic vasopressors on survival did not reach statistical significance in patients undergoing cardiac or non-cardiac surgery, the confidence intervals included the possibility of both no effect and a clinically important benefit from non-adrenergic agents. These findings justify the conduct of further RCTs comparing non-adrenergic vasopressors to usual care based on noradrenaline alone.

### Drug diluent and efficacy of methylene blue in septic shock: authors' reply [^112ySX1N]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Drug manufacturers are usually compelled to warn about possible interactions of certain compounds based on pre-clinical data. A common example is norepinephrine bitartrate, whose manufacturers warn about possible inactivation if prepared with NS due to oxidation; however, stability of norepinephrine in NS for prolonged time has been confirmed for decades. Patients are always closely monitored for any potential adverse effects in RCTs, and although our results could be considered as reassuring, we recognize the importance of post-marketing drug safety surveillance in real-world settings, and urge clinicians to strictly adhere to specifications of manufacturers along with local pharmacy department policies. Notwithstanding, we would like to pinpoint other pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic factors that could have improved the efficacy of MB in our trial even more than the use of NS; namely, an initial 1 mg/kg bolus, doses of 2–3 mg/kg instead of fixed 100 mg, continuous infusion, repeated doses until shock resolution instead of a fixed 3-doses scheme, and especially, aiming for an earlier administration after septic shock diagnosis, as it has been suggested that efficacy could be enhanced if MB is used within the first 8 h.

### The clinical conundrum of vasoplegia with mechanical circulatory support devices [^112dADKR]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Once vasoplegia becomes manifest, and after filling pressures have been adequately optimized, use of catecholamine and non–catecholamine-based drugs are necessary, often in high doses. However, it is not known nor well studied what sequence or combination of such drugs ought to be employed for successful outcomes. While this represents an area for scientific inquiry, until such evidence can be forthcoming, clinicians have employed distinctive tactics, but their effects on outcomes are uncertain. The primary mode of treatment uses catecholamines, preferably norepinephrine, which has been shown to be associated with the least hemodynamic and physiological stress in this clinical scenario. As an example, in comparative effectiveness studies, norepinephrine has fewer toxic effects compared to dopamine, and in other shock states epinephrine is associated with greater expression of lactic acidosis than norepinephrine. A useful strategy to limit high doses of catecholamines posits use of concomitant vasopressin, an agent that exploits a known deficiency of this hormone in this situation and one that in combination with catecholamines may avoid the deleterious tissue effects of high doses of a single agent. Vasopressin (or its analogs) predominantly acts by binding to the arginine vasopressin receptor A1 (with other effects on oxytocin) which in turn suppresses cyclic guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate activation due to NO. Other noncatecholamine drugs include angiotensin II (which acts via vasoconstrictive effects of the angiotensin type 1 receptor on smooth muscles, increases in sympathetic drive and also influences vasopressin release from the posterior pituitary), methylene blue (which suppresses NO and cytokine cascade effects), hydroxycobalamine (which acts as a NO scavenger) and the "HAT" combination which includes hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid, and thiamine. The hypothesis of "HAT" use is based on the demonstration of marked vitamin C deficiency due to CPB as well as in the potential restorative function of this combined supplementation on endothelial disruption. However, most studies in vasodilatory shock (mostly due to sepsis) have not shown benefit and such use remains experimental or anecdotal.

The study of vasoplegia warrants more thoughtful integration of prevention and treatment strategies to mitigate its negative pathophysiological consequences. Standardized nomenclature and identification of precise pathophysiological targets are crucial for progress. As Confucius said, "There is never a case when the root is in disorder and yet the branches are in order".

### Severe vasoplegic syndrome treated with angiotensin II and hemoadsorption therapy after cardiac surgery [^116k4nTA]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 The Angiotensin II Choice

Angiotensin II, a potent endogenous vasoconstrictor, has emerged as a therapeutic option for distributive shock unresponsive to traditional vasopressors. The ATHOS‐3 trial (Angiotensin II for the Treatment of High‐Output Shock, 2017) provided evidence that angiotensin II significantly increased blood pressure in patients with vasodilatory shock of any cause who were refractory to high‐dose conventional vasopressors. This evidence supports its use as an effective adjunctive therapy in managing VS.

Moreover, in a post‐hoc analysis of the ATHOS‐3 trial, Tumlin et al. had demonstrated greater 28‐day survival and mean arterial pressure response in patients with VS of any cause treated with angiotensin II and acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy at study drug initiation. Bellomo et al. in the mixed population of the A THOS‐3 trial, and other authors, in a septic patients population, demonstrated varying efficacy of angiotensin II therapy depending on renin plasma levels and proposed step‐by‐step algorithms for the management of vasoplegic shock including:
− the identification of VS.
− poor response to standard therapy.
− indications for angiotensin II infusion start and titration.
− other unconventional therapy options (like cyanocobalamin or methylene blue).

In these studies, most of the therapy protocol indicated an initial dose of 10−20 ng/kg/min, with the possibility of titration every 5−10 min since the pressure target was achieved, with a maximum dose of 80 ng/kg/min.

Recently, Kotani et al. reviewed 59 studies about angiotensin II use in any clinical setting, identifying 5 RCTs, 12 observational studies and some case report/case series: therapeutic dosages ranged from 20 to 80 ng/kg/min.

In our case report, angiotensin II was started after the identification of VS, unresponsive to standard therapy. The main target was to increase mean blood pressure to facilitate organ perfusion until the restoration of normal vascular tone. Angiotensin II was initiated at a dose of 20 ng/kg/min and increased to 40, 80, and then 100 ng/kg/min in 5 h: mean arterial pressure target was obtained and all other vasoactive drugs were decreased, then stopped after about 24 h. Angiotensin II was then de‐escalated from the morning of the POD1 to 30 ng/kg/min and then stopped in the POD2. After initiation of angiotensin II, lactate level progressively decreased to normal values, in the next day.

### Commentary: vasoplegia after aortic surgery: looking for options [^116ERrwf]. JTCVS Techniques (2020). Medium credibility.

The initial management for vasoplegic shock includes ruling out any other causes of refractory hypotension, including sepsis, bleeding, metabolic and/or electrolyte derangements, hypoxia, or cardiac failure. In thoracic aortic surgery, as in this case, the consequences of hypotension can be especially detrimental and permanent if they result in spinal cord ischemia. After a diagnosis of vasoplegia is made, the toolbox with which to address the high-output, low vascular resistance cardiovascular collapse must be evaluated and vasopressors and intravenous volume expansion become the first line in the tools of the trade. The algorithm presented by the authors in this case report summarizes the stepwise progression of vasopressor use. Over the years, several new tools have been added to the toolbox with which to address the difficult problem of vasoplegia. Several pharmacologic agents that have been demonstrated as being effective in vasoplegia include terlipressin, methylene blue, hydroxocobalamin, angiotensin II (Giapreza), vitamin C, flurbiprofen (Ropion), and hydrocortisone. As is evident by the plethora of options, no one option has proven to be the obvious superior agent. Within the circumstances of vasoplegia, by definition, the patients are rather unstable and we as clinicians try to use the "kitchen-sink" approach in this scenario to help alter the patient's clinical course. In this issue of the Journal, Chatterjee and colleaguesreport their experience in a patient undergoing thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair and their successful use of angiotensin II in this setting. The authors have one of the largest experiences with open thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair, and their efforts to optimize perioperative management in this critically ill cohort are to be commended.

### Ascorbic acid and microcirculation in cardiothoracic surgery: a pilot feasibility trial and matched cohort study [^111FXUAg]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical endpoints

Postoperative vasoplegia was identified in 9 (60%) of the trial participants compared to 17 (38%) of the historical controls (p = 0.13). The maximum postoperative vasopressor dosage at any time was greater in trial participants (0.09 mcg/kg/min) than in historical controls (0.04 mcg/kg/min), p = 0.03. No patients in either group received any other vasoplegia treatments (e.g. steroids, methylene blue, or hydroxocobalamin). The groups were similar in the overall vasopressor duration, occurrence of acute kidney injury, and intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay. One historical control died on postoperative day zero due to hemorrhagic shock. No ascorbic acid-related adverse events were noted in any of the trial participants.

### Non-adrenergic vasopressors for vasodilatory shock or perioperative vasoplegia: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1116ofTU]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review and meta-analysis followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (see Supplementary material for completed checklist). We registered this study in the PROSPERO International prospective register of systematic reviews (CRD42024505039). Our review question was built using the following PICOS (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, Study design) criteria: adult patients receiving vasopressor therapy for vasodilatory shock or perioperative vasoplegia (P); non-adrenergic vasopressors (I); adrenergic vasopressors or placebo (C); mortality at the longest follow-up available (O); RCTs (S).

Search strategy and selection criteria

Four researchers independently searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify relevant studies from inception to January 29, 2024. The complete search strategies are presented in the Supplementary material. We included RCTs comparing non-adrenergic vasopressors with adrenergic vasopressors or placebo in adult patients receiving vasopressor therapy for vasodilatory shock or perioperative vasoplegia. Non-adrenergic vasopressors included vasopressin, terlipressin, selepressin, angiotensin II, methylene blue, and hydroxocobalamin. Exclusion criteria were non-randomized trials, quasi-randomized trials, observational studies, systematic reviews, commentaries, editorials, narrative reviews, animal studies, or conference abstracts. We also excluded studies without mortality data or enrolling pediatric patients (≤ 15 years old). No restriction was applied to language. After removing duplicates, four investigators assessed eligibility at the title/abstract level. Then, four investigators evaluated the full text of all potentially relevant articles. In case of disagreement, the final assessment was discussed with a senior investigator.

Data collection

From eligible studies, two investigators independently extracted the following variables using a standardized data collection form: first author name, publication year, number of participating centers, patient population, number of patients in the non-adrenergic and control group, the non-adrenergic vasopressor, the comparator, baseline vasopressor dose, type of comparator drug, and outcome data.

Risk of bias assessment

The risk of bias of each included RCT was assessed independently by two investigators using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials version 2 (RoB 2). The overall certainty of the evidence was evaluated according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The GRADEpro software was used to create the GRADE evidence profile table.

### Administration of methylene blue in septic shock: pros and cons [^113ABE6r]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

In a recent retrospective cohort study, the effects of different dosing strategies of MB (bolus, bolus + infusion, infusion only) were assessed in 209 patients with different types of shock (septic, cardiogenic, vasoplegic) who were receiving norepinephrine at doses > 0.1 mcg/kg/min and had lactate concentrations > 2 mmol/L. Survival was improved in the group receiving a bolus + infusion strategy. In a recent randomized, controlled and double-blinded trial, Ibarra-Estrada et al. assessed whether early adjunctive MB administration could reduce the time to vasopressor discontinuation in 92 patients with septic shock who were randomly assigned, within the first 24 h after the start of norepinephrine, to receive an intravenous (IV) infusion of either normal saline or MB once daily for a total of 3 doses. MB-treated patients had a shorter time to vasopressor discontinuation (69 h [IQR 59–83] vs 94 h [IQR 74–141]; p < 0.001), more vasopressor-free days at 28-days (p = 0.008), a shorter ICU length of stay by 1.5 days (p = 0.039), and a shorter hospital length of stay by 2.7 days (p = 0.027) than the control group. However, the study had some limitations, including that the associated green discoloration of the urine makes blinding of the study impossible. It would also have been interesting to have more information on cardiac function and on the potential benefit for the patient of reducing the time of exposure to high doses of norepinephrine.

### Comparative study between high and low dose methylene blue infusion in septic cancer patients: a randomized, blinded, controlled study [^112oqKFd]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is a potentially fatal organ failure that can arise from an overreaction of the host to an infection. Despite being the leading cause of mortality within hospitals, it is treatable with timely and early therapies.

The Third International Consensus definitions, or Sepsis-3, are used in the 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC). Sepsis was defined as "life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection". A score of two or more on the Quick Sequential (Sepsis-related) Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) indicates organ dysfunction. Septic shock is a subset of sepsis in which major circulatory, cellular, and metabolic changes are associated with higher mortality than with sepsis alone. In euvolemic patients, to be diagnosed with septic shock a patient must be on a vasopressor to reach a mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥ 65 mmHg and with a serum lactate above 2 mmol/L.

The cornerstone of treating septic shock is administering, in the first hour, intravenous fluids, vasopressors, and antibiotics. The goal of management is to keep the patient hemodynamically stable until the antibiotics start working to combat the infection. Low-dose corticosteroids are prescribed for non-responders. Further research is required to determine whether other medications can aid non-responders as well as to enhance overall outcomes. A nitric oxide inhibitor called methylene blue (MB) can reverse the vasodilatation that occurs early in septic shock. Vasodilatation is caused by soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), which is activated by nitric oxide (NO). Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent protein kinases (PKGs) are then activated. Methylene blue inhibits inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and blocks sGC with selectivity. As a result, it affects the microcirculation only slightly. Intravenous MB acts within 30 to 60 min. Peak concentration is at 30 min. In addition to the kidneys, it is eliminated by the bile and fecal pathways. A plasma half-life of 5 to 6 h has led multiple investigators to administer a 0.25–2 mg/kg/h infusion for a duration of up to 3 days after a bolus dosage.

The aim of the trial is to compare the effects of high and low bolus doses of MB in sepsis in cancer patients. The main hypothesis of the study is that MB infusion would decrease the need for vasopressor infusion and that the initial high bolus dose of MB would be more beneficial than the low dose.

### Mixed cardiogenic-vasodilatory shock: current insights and future directions [^113NfpTP]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Due to the involvement of excessive NO release as a core driver of vasoplegia, the use of NOS inhibitors has been examined in both septic and cardiogenic shock. While these agents were effective at increasing MAP and decreasing vasopressor requirements, they did not improve survival and a signal of potential harm was suggested. Nonselective NOS inhibition reduces the harmful effects of excessive systemic NO production on the macrocirculation, at the cost of blocking the potentially beneficial effects of local NO production on the microcirculation and immune function. Accordingly, systemic NO inhibition is not an accepted strategy for patients with septic or cardiogenic shock. Nonetheless, the use of contemporary NO inhibitors such as methylene blue and hydroxycobalamin is well described in patients with vasoplegia, particularly after cardiac surgery. Like their predecessors studied in septic and cardiogenic shock, these drugs can increase MAP and SVR; however, data on improving survival outcomes are lacking. Therefore, NO inhibitors are a third-line strategy when adequate vascular tone cannot be restored with multiple vasopressors at doses that do not elicit toxicity, and further data are needed to determine their safety. Correction of severe metabolic alkalosis (eg, with alkali therapy) or severe ionized hypocalcemia (eg, with calcium chloride) can transiently improve MAP in shock without clear effects on survival.

Mechanical circulatory support

The rationale for the use of MCS devices in CS is centered on their ability to improve systemic and coronary perfusion, reduce cardiac filling pressures, facilitate revascularization, reduce vasoactive medication doses, all in order to interrupt the downward shock spiral of tissue hypoperfusion, end-organ failure, and death. In patients with CS, MCS devices increase CO which increases MAP, although the effect on MAP may limited by vasoplegia in mixed shock. The intra-aortic balloon pump in particular functions by reducing effective LV afterload and tends to be ineffective in patients who are vasoplegic, have low SVR, and/or require high vasopressor doses (ie, those with mixed shock).MCS devices such as percutaneous ventricular assist devices or VA ECMO generate a fixed amount of flow, which may be inadequate to restore MAP for patients who are vasoplegic.

Introduction: Generalized vasodilation with nonresponding hypotension is present in half death cases due to septicaemia. Methylene blue could be used as a valuable complement in refractory hypotension treatment. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of methylene blue as contributory treatment in patients with septic shock

Methods: A controlled, randomized, double blinded, clinical trial was performed. 60 patients were divided in two groups. A Group received a single dose of methylene blue calculated 2 mg/kg per body weight diluted in 100 cc of 5% dextrose infused in 60 min. and C Group, (control) received 100 cc of 5% dextrose infused in 60 min. Basal measurements of study variables were taken (MBP, lactate, base deficit, central venous saturation and CO2 delta) prior blue methylene administration and every hour afterwards, until MBP > 65 mmHg without vasopressor or 72 hours passed after shock began. Data about total noradrenaline dose in mg, length of stay, mechanical ventilation length and mortality was recorded

Results: MBP increased progressively first 6 hours after methylene blue infusion in A Group 22% and C Group 9.2% (p: < 0.05), steadily until 72 hour follow up. Noradrenaline dose decreased in the first 6 hours, on A Group an 86%, C Group was 56% (p: < 0.05). Lactate clearance first 6 hours was 62% in A Group, in contrast with C Group with 33% clearance (p: < 0.05). Mortality at ICU discharge on A Group was 20.0% and C Group was 36.6% (p: < 0.05) without variation at 21 days

Conclusions: Methylene blue is effective as contributory in septic shock treatment.

Vitamin B 12 deficiency and its sequelae are well described and reported, especially in vegetarians. However, its association with haemodynamic instability is not well identified. We report a case of a young man, previously healthy, presenting with fever, hypotension requiring vasopressors and pancytopenia. Extensive workup was unrevealing for possible infective, inflammatory or endocrine causes except for vitamin B 12 deficiency.

### Non-adrenergic vasopressors for vasodilatory shock or perioperative vasoplegia: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113ykdQQ]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

From 6159 records identified through literature search, we included 51 RCTs with a total of 5715 patients (Table 1 and Fig. 1). The major exclusions and reasons for exclusion are shown in Table S2. The predominant population investigated was septic shock in 30 studies, cardiac surgery in 11 studies, and non-cardiac surgery in 10 studies. The non-adrenergic agent assessed was vasopressin in 16 studies, terlipressin in 15 studies, selepressin in two studies, angiotensin II in five studies, methylene blue in 11 studies, and hydroxocobalamin in one study. The remaining study randomized patients into three groups (vasopressin, terlipressin, or noradrenaline) and was categorized as a vasopressin study in subgroup analyses based on drug type.

Placebo was used as a comparator in 25 studies, while adrenergic agents were administered and served as comparator in 26 studies. The baseline noradrenaline equivalent dose was 0.28 µg/kg/min in septic shock and 0.20 µg/kg/min in cardiac surgery, while no patient received vasopressors at baseline in non-cardiac surgery settings. The characteristics of the included studies and noradrenaline products used are summarized in Table 1 and Table S3.

The risk of bias assessment using RoB 2 deemed 17 studies as being at low risk of bias, 16 studies as having some concerns, and 18 studies as being at high risk of bias (Table S4).

### Vasoplegia after cardiovascular procedures-pathophysiology and targeted therapy [^116h4Qcu]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Vasoplegic syndrome, characterized by low systemic vascular resistance and hypotension in the presence of normal or supranormal cardiac function, is a frequent complication of cardiovascular surgery. It is associated with a diffuse systemic inflammatory response and is mediated largely through cellular hyperpolarization, high levels of inducible nitric oxide, and a relative vasopressin deficiency. Cardiopulmonary bypass is a particularly strong precipitant of the vasoplegic syndrome, largely due to its association with nitric oxide production and severe vasopressin deficiency. Postoperative vasoplegic shock generally is managed with vasopressors, of which catecholamines are the traditional agents of choice. Norepinephrine is considered to be the first-line agent and may have a mortality benefit over other drugs. Recent investigations support the use of noncatecholamine vasopressors, vasopressin in particular, to restore vascular tone. Alternative agents, including methylene blue, hydroxocobalamin, corticosteroids, and angiotensin II, also are capable of restoring vascular tone and improving vasoplegia, but their effect on patient outcomes is unclear.

### Administration of methylene blue in septic shock: pros and cons [^116ehWiJ]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Several agents have been tested as NOS inhibitors, with the hypothesis that blocking or modulating the excessive iNOS activity would be beneficial in this setting. NOS inhibitors may act to reverse the negative pathophysiological effects of NO overproduction on vascular tone and the hyporeactivity to vasopressor agents during sepsis. In the clinical trial setting, the principal agents that have been used in sepsis for this purpose are non-selective NOS inhibitors, such as methylarginine (L-NMMA) and nitroarginine (L-NNA). These agents have been shown to increase systemic vascular resistance and mean arterial pressure (MAP). It is important to remember however that blocking the NO pathway in septic shock is much more than just the effects on macrovascular hemodynamics, myocardial function, and hyporesponsiveness to adrenergic agents. The role of NO in sepsis is essential for the normal microvascular and immune responses to infection; therefore, global inhibition of NO synthesis in septic shock could be deleterious. Its multiple actions probably explain why the expected improvement in some macrocirculatory variables (for example, increase in MAP, SVR) with non-selective NO inhibitors does not translate directly into further clinical benefits, and may be harmful. Indeed, a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial by Lopez et al. showed that use of L-NMMA in septic shock patients increased 28-day mortality from 49 to 59%.

### Comparative study between high and low dose methylene blue infusion in septic cancer patients: a randomized, blinded, controlled study [^115JTNqZ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Randomization and blinding

The participants were allocated to three treatment groups by a preset randomization sequence that was prepared in sealed opaque envelopes. The sequence was computer-generated using a 1:1 allocation ratio and permuted blocks of size 2. Intervention assignment was the responsibility of the ICU physicians. The study lacked complete blinding due to the presence of bluish coloration on the skin and secretions caused by the administration of methylene blue. However, the allocation to low and high MB doses – which was the second objective of the study - was blinded to the patients and outcome assessors. The study drugs were prepared by an independent pharmacist.

Group A (n = 30) was given a placebo in the form of 100 mL of 0.9% NaCl over 20 min; Group B (n = 30) received a bolus of MB 1 mg/kg; and Group C (n = 30) received a bolus of MB 4 mg/kg in the same manner. Following the first MB bolus dosage in groups B and C, an infusion of 0.25 mg/kg/hour was administered for 72 h. A placebo NaCl infusion syringe was running for 72 h in Group A. Treatment was started within one to two hours of initiating vasopressor administration. All patients received noradrenaline at a rate of 0.1–0.2 µg/kg/min that was adjusted to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg. If noradrenaline at a dose of 0.2 µg/kg/min failed to maintain MAP at 65 mmHg, the patient received hydrocortisone 50 mg/6 hours, which was stopped after 6 h of noradrenaline discontinuation. Infusion bags and intravenous lines were prepared in opaque envelopes in the pharmacy in order not to identify the MB.

Adequate fluid resuscitation is guided by the non-invasive method using an ICON device to assess stroke volume and cardiac output and by inferior vena cava (IVC) collapsibility. The latter is calculated by the difference between the maximum (expiratory) and minimum (inspiratory) IVC diameters, divided by the maximum IVC diameter, and presented as a percentage. This was done 3 times per day as long as the patient was on vasopressors. During the first two hours following MB administration, no adjustments to noradrenaline or sedative/analgesic doses nor ventilator settings were made. After that, noradrenaline was titrated at 20-minute intervals to keep MAP between 65 and 75 mmHg until cessation of infusion.

### Hydroxocobalamin or methylene blue for vasoplegic syndrome in adult cardiothoracic surgery [^117Hc5qD]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare hydroxocobalamin and methylene blue for the treatment of vasopressor-refractory vasoplegic syndrome (VS) after adult cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).

Design

A retrospective, propensity-matched, cohort study was performed. The primary endpoints were the percentage change in vasopressor use at 30, 60, and 120 minutes, characterized as both norepinephrine equivalents and vasoactive inotropic score. Eligible patients who received methylene blue were matched 3:1 with patients who received hydroxocobalamin based on sequential organ failure assessment score, preoperative mechanical circulatory support, CPB duration, and use of pre-CPB vasopressors, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or beta-blockers.

Setting

A quaternary care academic medical center.

Participants

Adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery with CPB from July 2013 to June 2019.

Interventions

Patients were included who received either hydroxocobalamin (5,000 mg) or methylene blue (median 1.2 mg/kg) for VS in the operating room during the index surgery or in the intensive care unit up to 24 hours after CPB separation.

Measurements and Main Results

Of the 142 included patients, 120 received methylene blue and 22 received hydroxocobalamin. After matching, 66 patients in the methylene blue group were included in the analysis. Baseline demographics, surgical characteristics, and vasoactive medications were similar between groups. There were no significant between-group differences in percentage change in norepinephrine equivalents or vasoactive inotropic score at each timepoint.

Conclusions

In adult patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery using CPB with VS, the ability to reduce vasopressor use was similar with hydroxocobalamin compared with methylene blue.

### Methylene blue for distributive shock: a potential new use of an old antidote [^113SnYAi]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2013). Low credibility.

Methylene blue is used primarily in the treatment of patients with methemoglobinemia. Most recently, methylene blue has been used as a treatment for refractory distributive shock from a variety of causes such as sepsis and anaphylaxis. Many studies suggest that the nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NO-cGMP) pathway plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of distributive shock. There are some experimental and clinical experiences with the use of methylene blue as a selective inhibitor of the NO-cGMP pathway. Methylene blue may play a role in the treatment of distributive shock when standard treatment fails.

### Hydroxocobalamin versus methylene blue for vasoplegic syndrome in cardiothoracic surgery: a retrospective cohort [^1155yjJQ]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare methylene blue with hydroxocobalamin as a rescue therapy for vasoplegic syndrome.

Design

Retrospective cohort.

Setting

Academic medical center.

Participants

Patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery treated for vasoplegic syndrome.

Interventions

Thirty-five patients were treated with methylene blue (n = 16) or hydroxocobalamin (n = 19).

Measurements and Main Results

Mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and vasopressor exposures were recorded before and after medication administration. Change in time-averaged norepinephrine equivalents in the hour after administration was the primary outcome. The average norepinephrine equivalent observed at baseline in this cohort was 0.347 µg/kg/min. Methylene blue patients had greater Acute Physiological Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores (29.8 v 22.2; p = 0.01) and trended toward greater European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II values (26.8% v 15.1%; p = 0.07). Methylene blue and hydroxocobalamin were associated with increased mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance 1 hour after administration (10.6 mmHg and 192 dyn*sec/cm 5; p = 0.01 and p = 0.01, respectively; 11.8 mmHg and 254 dyn*sec/cm 5; p = 0.002 and p = 0.015, respectively). Hemodynamic changes were not different between the rescue therapy groups (p = 0.79 and p = 0.53, respectively). No significant differences were observed within the 1-hour change in time-averaged norepinephrine equivalents for either agent or when methylene blue and hydroxocobalamin were compared (0.012 ± 0.218 µg/kg/min v -0.037 ± 0.027 µg/kg/min; p = 0.46, respectively). When compared with baseline time-averaged norepinephrine equivalent (0.326 ± 0.106 µg/kg/min), only hydroxocobalamin was associated with decreased vasopressor requirements at the 1-hour (0.255 ± 0.129 µg/kg/min; p = 0.03) and 4-hour time points (0.247 ± 0.180 µg/kg/min; p = 0.04) post-administration.

Conclusion

Methylene blue and hydroxocobalamin increased mean arterial pressures and systemic vascular resistance without significantly decreasing time-averaged norepinephrine exposure in the hour after administration.

### Comparative study between high and low dose methylene blue infusion in septic cancer patients: a randomized, blinded, controlled study [^116jpqtH]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Septic shock is a common threat, and is the primary cause of death in almost all critical care units. Mortality of septic shock remains exceedingly high. The early use of methylene blue (MB) in different doses as adjunctive to vasopressors has promising results.

Methods

This double-blind, randomized, controlled trial comprised 90 patients divided into 3 groups: Group A received a 100 mL 0.9% NaCl placebo over 20 min; Group B received an MB bolus of 1 mg/kg in 100 mL 0.9% NaCl, and Group C received MB bolus of 4 mg/kg in 100 mL 0.9% NaCl during the same period. Groups B and C were given a 0.25 mg/kg/hour infusion of MB for 72 h after the bolus dose. All patients were started on noradrenaline at an infusion rate of 0.1–0.2 µ/kg/min and were adjusted accordingly to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg. Time of vasopressor discontinuation was the primary outcome while total doses of vasopressors, ventilation days, vasopressors free days, total ICU stay, total hospital stay, and mortality rate were the secondary outcomes.

Results

Groups B and C exhibited significantly decreased time to vasopressor termination, and vasopressor-free days at 28 days in comparison to Group A. However, there was no significant difference between Groups B and C. Groups B and C had significantly lower noradrenaline dosages compared to Group A, however, no significant difference between Group B and Group C was found. The difference between the three groups in mortality rate was near statistical significance (p = 0.083). Using the logistic regression model, the 4 mg/kg group was protective against mortality with a hazard ratio of 0.29 (95%CI: 0.09–0.90).

Conclusion

In cancer patients with septic shock, early adjunctive MB delivery reduces the time to a vasopressor stoppage and increases the vasopressor-free days. No significant difference between high and low MB bolus doses, and no significant adverse effects were noted. Compared to placebo, the 4 mg/kg bolus dose shows a survival advantage.

### Methylene blue reduces mortality in critically ill and perioperative patients: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^1164YMdb]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Vasodilatory hypotension is common in critically ill and perioperative patients, and is associated with adverse outcomes. As a nitric oxide production inhibitor, methylene blue (MB) exerts its vasoconstrictor property and is an adjuvant for catecholamine-refractory vasodilatory shock. However, the effects of MB on clinically relevant outcomes remain unclear. Therefore, the authors performed a meta-analysis of randomized trials on MB in critically ill and perioperative patients. The authors searched through databases for randomized trials on MB in critically ill and perioperative patients, which yielded 11 studies consisting of 556 patients. The primary outcome was mortality at the longest follow-up. Secondary outcomes included hemodynamic parameters and organ dysfunction (PROSPERO: CRD42023409243). Nine out of the 11 included randomized trials reported mortality, which was significantly lower in the MB group (risk ratio, 0.60 [95% CI 0.43–0.84] p = 0.003), with findings confirmed in septic shock and cardiac surgery subgroups. The authors found reduced lengths of stay in the intensive care unit (mean difference [MD], -0.9 days [95% CI -1.06 to -0.77] p < 0.001) and in the hospital (MD, -2.2 days [95% CI, -2.68 to -1.70] p < 0.001) in the MB group. MB was associated with increased mean arterial pressure (MD, 8.4 mmHg [95% CI 5.01–11.75] p < 0.001) and systemic vascular resistance (MD, 94.5 dyn/s/cm 5 [95% CI 17.73–171.15] p = 0.02), with no difference in cardiac output (standardized MD, 0.16 [95% CI, -0.25 to 0.57] p = 0.45). This meta-analysis showed that MB reverses vasodilation in critically ill and perioperative patients and might improve survival. Further adequately powered randomized trials are needed to confirm these findings.

### Successful use of angiotensin II for vasoplegia after thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair [^111nCmRa]. JTCVS Techniques (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Vasoplegia after cardiac surgery has an incidence of 5% to 45% and is associated with substantially elevated mortality risk. The standard management of vasoplegia includes treatment with vasopressors and other adjuncts (eg, methylene blue, hydroxocobalamin, vitamin C, thiamine, glucocorticoids). Because AngII has been shown to raise MAP, our institutional practice is to initiate AngII after cardiac surgery when vasopressors exceed an NEE of 0.3 μg/kg/min, or 0.4 μg/kg/min if the patient has sepsis or cirrhosis. However, the safety and efficacy of administering AngII after TAAAR have not been described, to our knowledge. On the basis of our institutional experience with AngII, we promptly initiated AngII infusion in our patient to achieve a minimally acceptable MAP of 80 mm Hg. Despite restoration of a satisfactory MAP, the patient required temporary continuous renal-replacement therapy; however, the more severe, life-altering complication of SCD was avoided.

Strategies to prevent vasoplegia include preoperative discontinuation of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors, postoperative discontinuation of medications that exacerbate hypotension (eg, propofol), and transfusion to a target hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL to improve oxygen delivery. Part of the diagnostic dilemma is that hypotension after TAAAR can also be related to a low cardiac output state, hypovolemia, or hemorrhage — all of which must be excluded. Our current vasoplegia management algorithm, including the escalation of vasopressors and use of adjuncts, is outlined in Figure 2. After a satisfactory MAP is achieved, selective use of adjuncts can be considered as a possible means of accelerating resolution of the vasoplegia process and weaning of all vasopressors (Video 1).

After our patient underwent TAAAR, we maintained a MAP of 80 mm Hg and confirmed intact neurologic function before reducing the dose of AngII. We conclude that in cases of severe vasoplegia refractory to conventional vasopressors, AngII can be considered as an alternative option for achieving an adequate MAP while reducing SCD risk.

Regarding medical management for methemoglobinemia, more specifically with respect to methylene blue, EHA/ERN-EuroBloodNet 2021 guidelines recommend to administer methylene blue at a starting dose of 1–2 mg/kg of 1% methylene blue as first-line therapy in symptomatic patients with methemoglobinemia. Repeat up to a dose of 5.5 mg/kg if there is no response after 30 minutes.

14.4 Cross-Study Findings

Experience with Dosing Greater than 10 g of Hydroxocobalamin

Across all four uncontrolled studies, 10 patients who did not demonstrate a full response to 5 or 10 g-doses of hydroxocobalamin were treated with more than 10 g of hydroxocobalamin. One of these 10 patients survived with unspecified neurological sequelae.

Effects on Blood Pressure

Initiation of hydroxocobalamin infusion as part of the therapeutic interventions generally resulted in increases in blood pressure and variable changes in heart rate (often normalization).

### Methylene blue for vasodilatory shock in the intensive care unit: a retrospective, observational study [^1172JZTs]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

There are currently limited pharmacologic therapies for patients presenting with vasoplegia. In this retrospective single institutional study, 233 patients received MB in the setting of shock (at least 72.5% of which were vasodilatory), of which 88 (39.5%) had a ≥ 10% increase in MAP within two hours of administration. Although not statistically significant, there was a trend toward improved survival to hospital discharge in patients with a response to MB. The dosing of MB may also play a role in identifying responders. Although the results were not statistically significant, MB responders were more likely to receive bolus dosing plus an infusion (44.3%) when compared to non-responders (33.3%). There was not a fixed protocol for dosing administration in this retrospective study and the pharmacokinetics of the drug may favor bolus and infusion dosing over bolus only dosing; the average duration of infusion for MB responders was 11.8 ± 9.5 hours.

The use of MB for vasodilatory shock has been described in the literature over the last thirty years in the setting of sepsis, post-cardiopulmonary bypass vasoplegia, anaphylaxis, liver failure, and drug-induced shock. Although studies have shown improvements in MAP and systemic vascular resistance from baseline after MB administration, a statistically significant improvement in survival has not been reliably shown. A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, 546C88, in septic shock found a higher likelihood of resolution of shock at 72 hours. However, a subsequent larger trial of treatment with 546C88 in patients with septic shock was halted early due to a statistically significant increase in 28 day mortality due to cardiovascular causes. Following this study, the further investigation of NOS inhibitors lost traction, however, a closer look at the findings suggests that some patients with very high cardiac outputs may have derived benefit. Furthermore, MB may target iNOS as opposed to 546C88 which is a non-specific NOS inhibitor.

### Vasoplegic syndrome following cardiothoracic surgery-review of pathophysiology and update of treatment options [^113hBNAL]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

The authors' approach to vasoplegia is presented as Fig. 2. Non-catecholamine agents should be started at lower doses of catecholamines (0.1 mcg/kg/min), with the first-line non-catecholamine agent being vasopressin, followed by methylene blue. Thereafter, hydroxocobalamin and/or angiotensin II should be used once catecholamine doses reach 0.2 μg/kg/min. Care should be taken to identify potential risk factors for intolerance or adverse reaction, and avoidance or discontinuation of the offending agent should be made accordingly.

Fig. 2
An approach to the treatment of vasoplegia. Non-catecholamine agents should be started at low doses, followed by non-catecholamine agents, including vasopressin and methylene blue. Use of hydroxocobalamin and/or angiotensin II should be considered with increasing doses of catecholamines. Clinical judgment should guide avoidance of certain agents if there is undue risk of side effects. All agents can be associated with intolerance, and discontinuation of offending agent(s) should be made accordingly

Additionally, the response to each agent should be evaluated, with discontinuation of any agent which yields an ineffective response (such as lack of an increase in MAP or a concomitant up-titration of other agents). Finally, attention should be paid to titration of adjustable agents, so as to avoid excessive or prolonged use. A titration table is presented as Table 2.

### A novel use of methylene blue in the pediatric ICU [^117978iE]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Methylene blue (MB) is a medication commonly used to treat methemoglobinemia, reducing methemoglobin to hemoglobin. A novel use of MB, as detailed here, is in the treatment of refractory hypotension. A number of reports have detailed use of MB for this purpose in adults, but few data in pediatrics. A 22-month-old girl with Noonan syndrome, biventricular hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and chronic positive pressure ventilation developed shock with tachycardia, hypotension, and fever after 3 days of diarrhea. She was critically ill, with warm extremities, bounding pulses, and brisk capillary refill. Laboratory tests revealed metabolic acidosis, low mixed venous oxygen saturation, and leukocytosis with bandemia. Treatment of severe septic shock was initiated with fluid resuscitation, inotropic support, sedation, and paralysis. She remained hypotensive despite norepinephrine at 0.7 μg/kg per minute, dopamine at 20 μg/kg per minute, and vasopressin at 0.04 U/kg per hour. Her vasoplegic shock worsened, despite aggressive conventional therapy. Intravenous MB was initiated, with a loading dose of 1 mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion at 0.25 mg/kg per hour. Upon initiation of MB, her systolic blood pressure increased by 33 points (40% increase), and diastolic blood pressure increased by 20 points (46% increase). She was able to wean off all inotropes quickly after initiation of MB. MB should be considered in the setting of refractory vasoplegic shock in the PICU.

### Does methylene blue administration to septic shock patients affect vascular permeability and blood volume? [^116mXwi4]. Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the effects of the inhibition of guanylate cyclase, an enzyme involved in sepsis-related vascular and myocardial dysfunctions, on hemodynamic variables including blood volume and pulmonary vascular permeability during septic shock.

Design

Prospective, open study with repeated measurements.

Setting

A medicosurgical intensive care unit of a university hospital.

Patients

Fifteen patients with septic shock associated with persisting hypotension despite conventional treatment including fluid loading, vasopressors, and inotropes.

Interventions

A fiberoptic catheter was inserted for the determination of blood and extravascular volumes by the thermal-dye double indicator technique, using indocyanine green (COLD system). A bolus dose of methylene blue (3 mg/kg) was infused intravenously over 10 mins. COLD-derived variables were recorded before methylene blue and 20 mins, 1 hr, and 2 hrs after the end of methylene blue infusion.

Measurements and Main Results

Standard hemodynamic and oxygen-derived variables; total, intrathoracic, systolic, and diastolic cardiac blood volumes; extravascular lung water; plasma osmolarity; and lactate and protein concentrations were recorded. Mean arterial and pulmonary artery pressures, systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances, and left ventricular stroke work index increased, and blood lactate transiently decreased after methylene blue (p < .05). The other variables recorded were unchanged during the 2-hr period following methylene blue infusion.

Conclusions

This study confirmed the acute vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic effects of methylene blue during septic shock. These effects were not associated with changes in blood volume, myocardial diastolic function, or pulmonary vascular permeability assessed by extravascular lung water.

### Elevated methemoglobin levels in a patient treated with hydroxocobalamin after suspected cyanide exposure [^1128DkUx]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cyanide (CN) toxicity commonly occurs during enclosed-space fires. Historically, the first step in treating CN toxicity utilized amyl nitrite and sodium nitrite to induce methemoglobinemia, which can be dangerous in this population. Hydroxocobalamin (OHCob), which binds to CN to form the nontoxic metabolite cyanocobalamin, is now the first-line antidote for CN toxicity, and has the advantage of not inducing methemoglobinemia.

Case Report

A 62-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department (ED) after a house fire. He was intubated for respiratory distress and hypoxia with an initial carboxyhemoglobin of 1.3%, methemoglobin 0.3%, and anion gap 19. Eleven hours after presentation, his serum lactic acid was 9 mmol/L. Given his continued deterioration, 14 h after arrival he received OHCob 5 g i.v. for presumed CN toxicity. Methemoglobin concentration 4 min prior to OHCob administration was 0.7%, and 2 h after administration was 4.2%. This subsequently increased to 14.3% (16 h after OHCob administration) and peaked at 16.3% (47 h after OHCob administration), at which time he was administered a dose of methylene blue 50 mg i.v., 60 h after ED arrival. His methemoglobin concentrations fluctuated until a consistent downward trend starting at 92 h from ED arrival. He continued to deteriorate and expired on hospital day 5 with a methemoglobin concentration of approximately 6.0%. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? CN toxicity requires immediate recognition and treatment. The antidote, OHCob, is believed to not induce methemoglobinemia. However, this potential side effect must be considered by emergency physicians when treating suspected CN toxicity, especially if the patient does not improve after antidotal therapy.

### Terlipressin for norepinephrine-resistant septic shock [^113Tu82n]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

Norepinephrine-resistant hypotension when associated with septic shock has a high rate of mortality, which might possibly be reduced by infusion of low-dose vasopressin. However, rebound hypotension often arises after treatment is stopped, and the drug usually has to be administered for several days. We report use of terlipressin, a long-acting vasopressin analogue, in eight patients with septic shock who did not respond to corticosteroids and methylene blue. A significant rise in blood pressure that lasted for at least 5 h was seen in all patients after a single bolus, allowing reduction or cessation of norepinephrine administration in seven patients. We were able to discharge four patients from intensive care subsequently. Terlipressin seems to be an effective rescue therapy, which is able to restore blood pressure in patients with catecholamine-resistant septic shock, without obvious complication.

### Administration of methylene blue in septic shock: pros and cons [^113384oF]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

MB has a slightly different profile, as it is an inhibitor of the soluble guanylate cyclase enzyme (sGC), whose activation is important in the NO signaling pathway. sGC catalyzes the production of cGMP in response to NO, and cGMP produces vasorelaxation and inhibits proliferation of vascular smooth cells. Blocking sGC with MB can therefore counteract the hemodynamic effects of NO. Compared with non-selective NOS inhibitors, MB may therefore block some of the deleterious effects of NO, while potentially maintaining its beneficial ones. Use of MB has thus been proposed in septic shock, as in other forms of vasoplegic shock, mainly cardiac surgery, anaphylactic shock, or in reperfusion syndrome after liver transplantation.

MB is a non-expensive and widely available molecule, which has been most commonly used to treat severe methemoglobinemia in the context of poisoning. When administered intravenously, MB has an onset of action of 30–60 min with a terminal plasma half-life of 5–6 h. It is metabolized by the liver and excreted primarily by the kidneys, so that patients with dysfunction of these organs have a higher risk of toxicity and drug interactions through cytochrome P450 inhibition. MB is generally well tolerated and toxicity is dose related; blue-green discoloration of urine, skin, and secretions is commonly described, which can interfere with the accuracy of pulse oximeter readings. More severe adverse effects, such as mesenteric vasoconstriction and paradoxical methemoglobinemia, have been reported with higher doses up to 4 mg/kg. Inhibition of monoamine oxidase A by MB can induce a serotonin syndrome. The use of MB is contraindicated in pregnancy and in patients with known glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.

### Infusion of methylene blue in human septic shock: a pilot, randomized, controlled study [^1127Mv32]. Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of continuous infusion of methylene blue (MB), an inhibitor of the nitric oxide pathway, on hemodynamics and organ functions in human septic shock.

Design

Prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label, pilot study.

Setting

Multidisciplinary intensive care unit of a university hospital.

Patients

Twenty patients with septic shock diagnosed < 24 hrs before randomization.

Interventions

Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either MB (MB group, n = 10) or isotonic saline (control group, n = 10), adjunctive to conventional treatment. MB was administered as an intravenous bolus injection (2 mg/kg), followed 2 hrs later by infusion at stepwise increasing rates of 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/kg/hr that were maintained for 1 hr each. During infusion, mean arterial pressure was maintained between 70 and 90 mm Hg, while attempting to reduce concurrent adrenergic support.

Measurements and Main Results

Hemodynamics and organ function variables were assessed over a 24-hr period, and the survival rate at day 28 was noted. Infusion of MB prevented the stroke volume and the left-ventricular stroke work indexes from falling and increased mean arterial pressure. Compared with the control group, MB reduced the requirement for norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine by as much as 87%, 81%, and 40%, respectively. Oxygen delivery remained unchanged in the MB group and decreased in the control group. MB also reduced the body temperature and the plasma concentration of nitrates/nitrites. Leukocytes and organ function variables such as bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, urea, and creatinine were not significantly affected. Platelet count decreased in both groups. Five patients treated with MB survived vs. three patients receiving conventional treatment.

Conclusions

In human septic shock, continuously infused MB counteracts myocardial depression, maintains oxygen transport, and reduces concurrent adrenergic support. Infusion of MB appears to have no significant adverse effects on the selected organ function variables.

### Comparative study between high and low dose methylene blue infusion in septic cancer patients: a randomized, blinded, controlled study [^113t6aGX]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

A case study showed that a bolus of 3 mg/kg for 20 min, followed by 0.5 mg/kg/h for 48 h early in septic shock reduced lactate levels, inflammatory cytokines, and the dose of vasopressors. Twenty-four hours after the MB was suspended, there was a rise in serum lactate and a return of noradrenaline to 0.03 µg/kg/min. This finding may be an indicator of the importance of continuous MB infusion to help maintain hemodynamics and tissue perfusion.

We believe that MB as a bolus + continuous infusion might prolong suppression of the NO pathway, which is accomplished in two phases: iNO synthase inhibition and the downstream sGC. Nevertheless, we failed to prove the hypothesis of a higher effect with a high bolus dose of MB. This may be attributed to the unpredictable duration of systemic inflammation in septic shock. Thus, the cumulative dose of MB appears more valuable than the bolus dose in septic shock, probably due to a half-life of 5–6 h.

Elevated MB in whole blood exceeds plasma concentration, indicating accumulation in blood cells. Acute inflammation triggers NO generation by immune cells, including macrophages, therefore augmenting the inflammatory stimulus. This might suppress an excessive inflammatory reaction in septic shock, which leads to hemodynamic derangement.

MB has the advantage of being a selective inhibitor of iNOS, sparing the constitutive isoform, therefore enhancing microcirculatory flow, increasing blood flow to ischemic regions, scavenging oxygen-free radicals, and promoting microbial death by macrophages. Also, MB can act as an antioxidant to decrease oxidative stress and lower plasma levels of IL-6.

When using MB in septic shock treatment, several points should be considered. One is toxicity. A one-time bolus of 1–2 mg/kg MB was shown to be safe in sepsis and was not associated with the development of methemoglobinemia. The current study provided evidence of the safety of a 4 mg/kg bolus dose. We did not observe adverse effects of MB on the circulatory, respiratory, or metabolic levels. Besides, no cases of methemoglobinemia were recorded. The continuous and extended infusion of MB can result in increased cumulative dosages, which may have hazardous effects. A recommended total cumulative dose of 5.75 mg/kg for continuous infusion in cases of septic shock was recommended. Higher dosages may result in methemoglobinemia. Therefore, the current work made use of a dosage of 0.25 mg/kg/h.

### Diagnosis and management of vasoplegia in temporary mechanical circulatory support: a narrative review [^114JBZyV]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Refractory vasodilatory shock, or vasoplegia, is a pathophysiologic state observed in the intensive care unit and operating room in patients with a variety of primary diagnoses. Definitions of vasoplegia vary by source but are qualitatively defined clinically as a normal or high cardiac index and low systemic vascular resistance causing hypotension despite high-dose vasopressors in the setting of euvolemia. This definition can be difficult to apply to patients undergoing mechanical circulatory support (MCS). A large body of mostly retrospective literature exists on vasoplegia in the non-MCS population, but the increased use of temporary MCS justifies an examination of vasoplegia in this population. MCS, particularly extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, adds complexity to the diagnosis and management of vasoplegia due to challenges in determining cardiac output (or total blood flow), lack of clarity on appropriate dosing of noncatecholamine interventions, increased thrombosis risk, the difficulty in determining the endpoints of adequate volume resuscitation, and the unclear effects of rescue agents (methylene blue, hydroxocobalamin, and angiotensin II) on MCS device monitoring and function. Care teams must combine data from invasive and noninvasive sources to diagnose vasoplegia in this population. In this narrative review, the available literature is surveyed to provide guidance on the diagnosis and management of vasoplegia in the temporary MCS population, with a focus on noncatecholamine treatments and special considerations for patients supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, transvalvular heart pumps, and other ventricular assist devices.

### Methylene blue for refractory shock in polytraumatized patient: a case report [^113KDh2B]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Methylene blue (MB) has been advocated for the treatment of shock refractory to standard measures. MB is proposed to increase blood pressure in shock by interfering with guanylate cyclase and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity. Several studies have evaluated the vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic effects of MB in septic shock patients. However, there is a paucity of studies involving trauma patients.

Case Report

A 4-year-old boy was hit by a truck while riding his bicycle and was treated with fluid resuscitation at the emergency department and then taken to the operating room for damage-control surgery. He had liver, diaphragm, rectal, and thoracic injuries. At the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), he remained hypotensive despite volume, dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine infusion. A dose of 0.5 mg/kg of i.v. MB was administered. During the next 2 h after MB administration, we were able to wean him off norepinephrine, and doses of epinephrine and dopamine were reduced. Ultimately, he was discharged from the PICU 13 days later in good condition. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Trauma patients who have experienced bleeding and survived the initial insult are still at risk of dying from continuing systemic hypoperfusion and the resultant multiple organ dysfunctions. Use of a low dose of MB as an adjuvant to treat shock might improve survival of these patients.

### Comparative study between high and low dose methylene blue infusion in septic cancer patients: a randomized, blinded, controlled study [^116vd2B3]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Several clinical trials and meta-analyses provided evidence indicating that MB may decrease short-term mortality in patients with septic shock. Additional findings indicate that the injection of MB may improve hemodynamic status, elevate MAP, decrease the duration of vasopressor exposure, and shorten the time of hospitalization. However. different dose regimens of MB were evaluated varying from bolus delivery to bolus administration followed by continuous infusion, or continuous infusion only. So far, no research has explored the ideal dosage strategy for patients with septic shock. Based on a recent study, we adopted the bolus + continuous infusion strategy. This strategy was found to be associated with decreased 28-day mortality. We used a 4 mg/kg bolus dose aiming to enhance the effectiveness of MB based on a previous dose-finding study. This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind study that tested 3 bolus doses of MB, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 7 mg/kg over 20 min in mechanically ventilated patients with septic shock. The authors concluded that MB increases MAP, improves left ventricular filling and function, and raises cardiac output in a dose-dependent manner. We hypothesized that the high dose would be more effective in the current group of cancer patients with septic shock. Nevertheless, our results did not completely substantiate this idea.

In this prospective study, the 1 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg bolus doses were almost equally effective adjuvants for the treatment of septic shock. We found that MB had a positive impact on noradrenaline requirement in septic shock as it significantly reduced the time to discontinue vasopressor administration and vasopressor-free days compared to the placebo group. Noradrenaline doses over time points and its total consumption at 28 days were significantly lower with the use of MB irrespective of the bolus dose used. Serum lactate was lower and MAP higher in the methylene blue groups. PaO₂/FiO₂ and RSBI also improved with the use of methylene blue. However, the effect on mortality of the two used doses was found to be insignificant. Nevertheless, an important observation was that the 4 mg/kg dose had a survival advantage when compared to the control group with a hazard ratio of 0.29 (95%CI: 0.09–0.90). We do not have a clear explanation of this survival advantage of the high-dose bolus. However, this might stem from early intensified control of noradrenaline action, which may limit its serious adverse effects.

### Case report of high-dose hydroxocobalamin in the treatment of vasoplegic syndrome during liver transplantation [^115VeftH]. American Journal of Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

A 66-year-old man with cryptogenic cirrhosis secondary to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis presented for orthotopic liver transplantation. Following organ reperfusion, the patient developed vasoplegic syndrome, with arterial blood pressures of approximately 60–70/30–40 mm Hg (mean arterial pressure [MAP] < 45 mm Hg) for > 90 minutes. He required high-dose norepinephrine and vasopressin infusions, as well as i.v. bolus doses of norepinephrine and vasopressin to reach a goal MAP > 60 mm Hg. There was minimal response to a 2 mg/kg i.v. bolus of methylene blue. Following the administration of 5 g of i.v.hydroxocobalamin, the patient had a profound improvement in arterial blood pressure, with subsequent discontinuation of the vasopressin infusion and rapid reduction of norepinephrine infusion from 20 to 2 μg/min. While there have been several reports of the efficacy of hydroxocobalamin for vasoplegia after cardiopulmonary bypass, there have been only limited cases of hydroxocobalamin used in liver transplantation, and none with high-dose administration. We present a case of vasoplegic syndrome during liver transplantation that was refractory to high-dose vasopressors and methylene blue but responsive to high-dose i.v. hydroxocobalamin.

### Short-term beneficial effects of methylene blue on kidney damage in septic shock patients [^1126wf9k]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

We previously demonstrated that upregulation of renal inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is associated with proximal tubule injury during systemic inflammation in humans. In this study we investigated the short-term effect of methylene blue (MB), an inhibitor of the NO pathway, on kidney damage and function in septic shock patients.

Design and Setting

A prospective clinical study conducted in an intensive care unit.

Patients

Nine patients (four men, five women, mean age 71 ± 3 years) with confirmed or suspected bacterial infection and with refractory septic shock defined as a mean arterial pressure ≤ 70 mmHg despite norepinephrine infusion ≥ 0.2 microg/kg per minute.

Interventions

A 4 h continuous intravenous infusion of 1 mg/kg MB per hour.

Measurements and Results

The urinary excretion of NO metabolites decreased with median 90% (range 75–95%) from baseline to 6 h after MB administration. The first 24 h creatinine clearance improved by 51% (18–173%) after MB treatment but was still strongly impaired. During the first 6 h after the start of MB treatment both the urinary excretion of cytosolic glutathione S-transferase A1–1 and P1–1, markers for proximal and distal tubule damage, respectively, decreased by 45% (10–70%) and 70% (40–85) vs. baseline. After termination of the MB infusion the NO metabolites and markers of tubular injury returned to pretreatment levels.

Conclusions

In septic patients with refractory shock short-term infusion of MB is associated with a decrease in NO production and an attenuation of the urinary excretion of renal tubular injury markers.

Treatment

Non-mechanical (i.e. blood purification or CPB circuit) treatment options for vasoplegic syndrome include elements of the sympathetic nervous system (catecholamines), the arginine-vasopressin system (vasopressin), and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (angiotensin II), as well as moderators of NO and/or inflammation (methylene blue, hydroxocobalamin, vitamin C, thiamine and corticosteroids). A comprehensive list of all of these agents is presented as Table 1.

### Comparative study between high and low dose methylene blue infusion in septic cancer patients: a randomized, blinded, controlled study [^115rARsX]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Similar outcomes of MB use were reported in previous trials with different dosing regimens. A bolus of 4 mg/kg of MB over 1 h was investigated in ten patients with severe septic shock. The authors showed a positive impact on systemic parameters including arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and left ventricular stroke volume. However, it exerted a negative impact on pulmonary circulation and gas exchange. Although they showed a reduction of serum lactate, they could not explain it by improvement in tissue perfusion. This may be due to an improvement in oxygen utilization at a cellular level or a direct reduction property of MB. Worth noting is that in this pilot study patients were already suffering from severe septic shock and respiratory failure. With the same high bolus dose of 4 mg/kg, we did not observe a negative adverse effect on oxygenation or gas exchange. In the current study, serum lactate showed a continuous reduction that extended to 24 h after cessation of MB infusion.

In refractory septic shock, 1 mg/kg MB infusion increased SVR and MAP. A bolus of 2 mg/kg MB, followed by infusion at an increasing rate of 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/kg/hr for 1 h lowered the noradrenaline requirement in septic shock patients. MB infusion at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/hr for 6 h positively impacted MAP with no effect on mortality rates. A more recent randomized trial examined the efficacy of a daily continuous infusion of 100 mg of MB over 6 h for 3 days in septic shock. MB infusion was associated with a shorter time to vasopressor discontinuation, more vasopressor-free days, and a shorter length of stay in the ICU and hospital compared to a placebo control group. No mortality benefit was noted. A meta-analysis of 6 RCTs including 214 patients showed that MB improved MAP and decreased serum lactate with a non-significant decrease in mortality.

2 Discussion

VS is a severe complication that can occur in 9%−40% of patients following cardiac surgery with CPB, characterized by hypotension (MAP < 65 mmHg), profound vasodilation (SVR < 800 dynes*s/cm⁵) and high cardiac output (CI > 2.2 L/min/m²), poor response to fluid therapy and a diminished response to conventional vasopressors such as norepinephrine and vasopressin.

Predisposing factors are advanced age, long CPB times, preoperative ACE inhibitor or ARB use and history of chronic kidney disease. Intraoperative risks factors are surgical trauma and cell saver blood reinfusion. Pathophysiology is complex and involves a systemic inflammatory response triggered by the exposure of blood components to the artificial surfaces of the extracorporeal circuit, surgical trauma, ischemia‐reperfusion injury, the release of endotoxin from the gut into the circulation, and hemolysis with liberation of free hemoglobin contained in the cell saver blood. Altogether, these mechanisms promote the activation of the complement cascade and the expression of pro‐inflammatory mediators that also induce nitric oxide synthase, increasing nitric oxide production and subsequent vasodilation. Desensitization of adrenergic receptors and reduction of plasma vasopressin also promote vasodilation, hypotension, and impaired responsiveness to drug therapies.

In the presented case, the patient had some risk factors for developing VS: chronic kidney disease, long CPB time, surgical trauma, and cell saver blood reinfusion.

The clinical pattern here presented corresponds to the VS definition, including poor responsiveness to vasoactive drugs and fluid therapy.

VS management includes:
− fluids.
− catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, etc.).
− non‐catecholamines (vasopressin, methylene blue, hydroxocobalamin, angiotensin II).
− adjuvants (ascorbic acid, hydro‐cortisone, calcium, sodium bicarbonate).

The VS episode here presented was managed with fluids, hydrocortisone, catecholamines and vasopressin at very high dosages but it was unresponsive to these standard therapies. Some other rescue or unconventional therapies cited were not initiated (methylene blue, hydroxocobalamin) because the clinical scenario was considered too severe to wait the onset of action.

Another point is cardiac ischemia. In this study, some ECG ischemic changes in a few patients were identified. These changes were transient and disappeared while the MB infusion was continuous. It may be attributed to a temporary loss of the beneficial vasodilatory effects of NO on myocardial blood flow due to MB administration.

Limitations

Some limitations should be admitted. First, this was a single-center study. However, as the largest reference center for cancer care in Egypt, this study exhibited the results of using MB in a special group of patients with different types of cancer as the primary disease. They were relatively younger than patients admitted to the ICUs of general hospitals with septic shock. Most patients were already managed in other departments of the NCI while diagnosed with septic shock. Therefore, nosocomial infection is a very common occurrence in such a patient group. Another limitation is that we did not study the other factors contributing to mortality to reach a robust conclusion about the effect of MB on mortality. We did not measure cytokine or nitrate/nitrite serum levels to settle the mechanism of the effects of MB. The study lacked complete blinding due to the presence of bluish coloration on the skin and secretions caused by the administration of methylene blue. However, we kept the blinding of patients and outcome assessors for groups allocated to low and high MB doses.

While acknowledging these limitations, our work contributes to the existing knowledge on the impact of MB on septic shock. To our knowledge, the present work is the first to provide a comparison between the standard bolus dosage of 1 mg and a high dose of 4 mg/kg. Hence, we have determined that MB is safe at this targeted dosage in cancer patients.

In conclusion, in septic shock, early adjunctive MB delivery during the first two hours of vasopressor initiation was associated with early discontinuation and reduced total consumption of noradrenaline. The 1 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg bolus doses of MB were similarly effective. Compared to the placebo control group, the 4 mg/kg bolus dose had a survival advantage. However, there was no significant effect on mortality for the 1 mg/kg bolus. No major side effects were observed. There were no significant adverse effects in both dose regimens.

We recommend initiating MB treatment in a bolus dose of 4 mg/kg bolus dose followed by 0.25 mg/kg/hour for 72 h in patients with septic shock within 2 h of starting vasopressors. Monitoring of possible adverse effects is essential during MB treatment.

Objectives

To describe the epidemiology of methylene blue (MB) use in septic shock and explore the association between MB dose and hospital outcomes.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

United States.

Patients

Eight hundred fifty-nine thousand eight hundred sixty-eight adult (≥ 18 yr) patients from 1100 centers with a diagnosis of septic shock (sepsis with vasopressor administration), discharged from Premier Healthcare Database hospitals in the United States from 2008 to 2021.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

We included patients who received MB at any point during hospitalization (to describe utilization), then separately focused on those who received MB within the first 3 hospital days (to examine association of dose with outcomes). The primary outcome was hospital mortality. We used mixed-effects multivariable regression models to evaluate the MB use and the association between MB dose (modeled as a five-knot restricted cubic spline) and outcomes. Among patients with septic shock, 4082 patients (0.5%) from 663 hospitals received at least one dose of MB. Patients receiving MB tended to be younger and received major surgery. Hospitals in which MB was administered were larger urban teaching hospitals. After multivariable adjustment, use of MB was lower in 2016–2020 than in 2008. Of 2507 patients (61.4%) who received MB within the first 3 days of hospitalization, 375 (15.0%) died in hospital. Our spline analysis suggests a nonlinear association between MB dosing and outcomes among patients receiving MB early in their hospitalization.

Conclusions

Use of MB in septic shock is rare in the United States, but with substantial inter-hospital variability and decreased use over time through 2020. Randomized evidence is required to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MB.

Hydroxocobalamin

Hydroxocobalamin is indicated in the treatment of cyanide toxicity and is noted to have a side effect of increased blood pressure (CYANOKIT package insert (single 5-g vial), Columbia, MD: Meridian Medical Technologies, Inc.; 2017). The mechanism of hydroxocobalamin-induced blood pressure response remains unknown, but is believed to be related to the NO pathway. Hydroxocobalamin is a potent direct inhibitor of NO as well as NO synthase. Additionally, hydroxocobalamin modifies innate hydrogen sulfide, an endothelial-bound endogenous vasodilator, increasing elimination. Like MB, patients receiving hydroxocobalamin are at risk for certain side effects, including chromaturia, nausea, erythema, nephrolithiasis, lymphocytopenia, and infusion site reactions (CYANOKIT package insert (single 5-g vial), Columbia, MD: Meridian Medical Technologies, Inc.; 2017). Chromaturia may last several weeks and has the potential to interfere with hemodialysis machines, causing false blood leak alarms. Importantly, hydroxocobalamin may also be associated with acute renal failure by virtue of increased risk of oxalate nephropathy.

Recently, case reports and series have demonstrated an increase in MAP in patients with vasoplegic syndrome when hydroxocobalamin is administered at a dose of 5 g over 15 min. The largest cohort of patients published found a variety of responses when used in refractory cases. Of those 33 patients, nine patients had no response, and the rest either had an adequate initial response, prolonged response, or had rebound hypotension within 2 h. Hydroxocobalamin was also evaluated in a case report of two patients with vasoplegic syndrome, in which a positive fluid balance was reversed after administration. Barker et al. compared the effects of hydroxocobalamin to MB in 58 patients, 29 in each group, and found similar response in MAP, vasopressor requirements at 1 h, time to discontinuation of vasopressors, and length of stay, and a higher incidence of renal replacement therapy in patients receiving hydroxocobalamin compared to MB alone (PENDING PUBLICATION). However, a large number of these patients also received MB prior to hydroxocobalamin and were sicker in general. Similarly to MB, no dose-finding studies of hydroxocobalamin in the vasoplegia population have been completed. Dosing is extrapolated from the treatment of cyanide poisoning (5 g administered by IV infusion over 15 min × 1–2 doses).

### A review of methylene blue treatment for cardiovascular collapse [^117QEeh3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Historically, methylene blue (MB) has been used for multiple purposes, including as an antidote for toxin-induced and hereditary methemoglobinemia, ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy, and ackee fruit and cyanide poisoning; as an aniline dye derivative, antimalarial agent, and antidepressant.

Discussion

Most recently, the use of MB has been advocated as a potential adjunct in the treatment of shock states. Our article reviews the role of MB in septic shock, anaphylactic shock, and toxin-induced shock. MB is proposed to increase blood pressure in these shock states by interfering with guanylate cyclase activity, and preventing cyclic guanosine monophosphate production and vasodilatation.

Summary

MB may be an adjunct in the treatment of septic shock, anaphylactic shock, and toxin-induced shock.

ISHLT Topic 4: Early postoperative care — treatment of postoperative vasoplegia notes that reduction in vascular tone after heart transplant is postulated to occur due to a general inflammatory response to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and dysregulation of the cGMP-NO pathway; risk factors include older recipient age, longer period of LVAD support, impaired renal function, prolonged CPB time, and prolonged ischemic time. Vasoplegia can be severe and refractory to conservative therapy and is associated with increased morbidity, with an underlying mechanism related to increased nitric oxide synthesis stimulating guanylatecyclase leading to cGMP production with subsequent vascular relaxation. Treatment involves titrating vasoactive pressors to improve vascular tone and restore adequate perfusion pressure; norepinephrine is considered the first-line agent for treatment of vasoplegia, followed by vasopressin and then only a single dose of methylene blue; other vasoactive medications include epinephrine, dopamine and oral midodrine, and there are case reports of successful treatment with a single dose of methylene blue, temporary ECMO support, and oral droxidopa and hydroxocobalamin.

### Predictors and impact of prolonged vasoplegia after continuous-flow left ventricular assist device implantation [^115Fd7ZY]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Transient vasoplegia was not associated with increased mortality in our study, whereas the progression to prolonged vasoplegia within the 12- to 24-hour window was associated with adverse outcomes. Therefore, early treatment of vasoplegia may offer a potential therapeutic target to prevent the development of prolonged vasoplegia.

When vasoplegia is severe, high doses of multiple vasopressors may be insufficient. In our practice, we begin by avoiding medications associated with vasoplegia (eg, propofol, milrinone). Our current pharmacological strategy after norepinephrine and vasopressin administration exceeds a norepinephrine equivalent dosage of 0.3 μg/kg/min is to initiate angiotensin II. Once a MAP of 70 mm Hg is achieved and the other vasopressors are down-titrated, the angiotensin II is weaned off. We are mindful of maintaining a renal perfusion pressure (MAP-CVP) ≥ 60 mm Hg and adjusting hemodynamic targets accordingly to reduce the risk for AKI. Patients at higher risk for developing postoperative prolonged vasoplegia may benefit from earlier administration of angiotensin II or other therapeutic adjuncts to achieve a target MAP. Increasing data suggest that angiotensin II benefits patients with vasoplegic shock who need renal replacement therapy for AKI. We will occasionally use rescue measures, including glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, methylene blue, or hydroxycobalamin. In addition, lactic acidosis is treated aggressively with sodium bicarbonate or, in severe cases, with renal replacement therapy as needed.

Study Limitations

This study was susceptible to the limitations of any single-institution retrospective report, despite having a larger sample size than the other CF-LVAD vasoplegia studies in the current literature. First, it is difficult to isolate vasoplegic shock completely, as there may have been an element of hemorrhagic shock or RVF in some patients. Moreover, some patients who presented with prolonged vasoplegia in the first 24 hours may have developed RVF later. Three of the other LVAD vasoplegia studies did not exclude patients with RVF, and 1 excluded patients who subsequently needed a right ventricular assist device. We recognize that vasoplegic shock may coexist with RVF in some patients or can lead to RVF in the early perioperative period. We attempted to minimize the confounding from RVF by including the high cardiac output and low SVR requirements characteristic of vasoplegia but not RVF. Moreover, chart abstraction was performed for every patient categorized as having vasoplegia, in order to confirm that concomitant RVF was not present.

### Hydroxocobalamin (Cyanokit) [^112yikVa]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

2.2 Recommended Dosing

The starting dose of hydroxocobalamin for adults is 5 g administered as an intravenous infusion over 15 minutes (approximately 15 mL/min). Administration of the entire vial constitutes a complete starting dose. Depending upon the severity of the poisoning and the clinical response, a second dose of 5 g may be administered by intravenous infusion for a total dose of 10 g. The rate of infusion for the second dose may range from 15 minutes (for patients in extremis) to two hours, as clinically indicated.

2.3 Preparation of Solution for Infusion

Reconstitute the 5 g vial of hydroxocobalamin with 200 mL of diluent (not provided with CYANOKIT) using the supplied sterile transfer spike. The recommended diluent is 0.9% Sodium Chloride injection (0.9% NaCl). Lactated Ringers injection and 5% Dextrose injection (D5W) have also been found to be compatible with hydroxocobalamin and may be used if 0.9% NaCl is not readily available. The line on the vial label represents 200 mL volume of diluent. Following the addition of diluent to the lyophilized powder, the vial should be repeatedly inverted or rocked, not shaken, for at least 60 seconds prior to infusion.

Visually inspect hydroxocobalamin solutions for particulate matter and color prior to administration. If the reconstituted solution is not dark red or if particulate matter is observed after the solution has been appropriately mixed, the solution should be discarded.

2.4 Incompatibility Information

Physical incompatibility (particle formation) and chemical incompatibility were observed with the mixture of hydroxocobalamin in solution with selected drugs that are frequently used in resuscitation efforts. Hydroxocobalamin is also chemically incompatible with sodium thiosulfate and sodium nitrite and has been reported to be incompatible with ascorbic acid. Therefore, these and other drugs should not be administered simultaneously through the same intravenous line as hydroxocobalamin.

Simultaneous administration of hydroxocobalamin and blood products (whole blood, packed red cells, platelet concentrate and/or fresh frozen plasma) through the same intravenous line is not recommended. However, blood products and hydroxocobalamin can be administered simultaneously using separate intravenous lines (preferably on contralateral extremities, if peripheral lines are being used).

2.5 Storage of Reconstituted Drug Product

Once reconstituted, hydroxocobalamin is stable for up to 6 hours at temperatures not exceeding 40°C (104°F). Do not freeze. Any reconstituted product not used by 6 hours should be discarded.

### Markers of nitric oxide are associated with sepsis severity: an observational study [^113fdCKm]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

We found that plasma hArg levels were significantly reduced whereas lArg levels remained unchanged in patients with sepsis. Plasma ADMA levels were increased in patients with sepsis; and both hArg and ADMA were associated with sepsis severity. Taken together the plasma hArg:ADMA ratio was increasing, and was closely associated with septic shock.

Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response to an infection. The two most important factors affecting sepsis outcome are circulatory failure and immune suppression. NO is a pivotal signaling molecule with regulatory functions in both the circulation and the immune response. In this context, we hypothesized that decreased NO bioavailability in sepsis may contribute to disease progression. Physiologically NO regulates blood pressure. In vascular disease associated with hypertension such as atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, or chronic renal failure low substrate levels but high inhibitor levels of NOS are markers of disease severity and mortality. This is supported by experimental observations in animals and humans; supplementation of lArg in rabbits can restore vascular relaxation and endothelial function, whereas in humans infusion of ADMA results in increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP). In contrast, the hallmark of sepsis and septic shock is reduced oxygen delivery depending on alteration in cardiac output (CO), the product of SVR and MAP. This leads to the hypothesis that excessive NO production may contribute to reduced SVR and MAP. Therefore it was appealing to test NOS inhibitors in sepsis to restore oxygen delivery. A randomized clinical trial compared intravenous administration of the non-selective NOS inhibitor L-N G -methyl-L-arginine hydrochloride (546C88) with placebo. Indeed, 546C88 directly increased SVR but cardiac output and oxygen delivery were subsequently blunted. Nonetheless, in the long term, administration of 546C88 was associated with higher mortality. This can be explained by the fact that systemic inhibition of NOS in all tissues might be responsible for reducing signs of hypotension but may have an impact on capillary exchange or the immune response. An alternative therapeutic concept might be the inhibition of the downstream signaling of NO, e.g. by methylene blue.

### Non-adrenergic vasopressors for vasodilatory shock or perioperative vasoplegia: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111R7o9z]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary outcome

In septic shock studies (30 RCTs with 4122 patients), the administration of non-adrenergic vasopressors was associated with a significantly reduced mortality (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86 to 0.97; P = 0.03; I² = 0%) (Table 2 and Fig. 2). The primary outcome data were similar in the sensitivity analyses except for the one addressing hydroxocobalamin (Fig. 2 A and Fig. S1). The TSA confirmed the robustness of evidence indicating reduced mortality with the use of non-adrenergic agents (Fig. S2).

No significant mortality differences were observed in 11 cardiac surgery studies with 822 patients (34/410 [8.3%] vs. 47/412 [11%]; RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.22; P = 0.32; I² = 12%) and in 10 non-cardiac surgery studies with 771 patients (9/388 [2.3%] vs. 18/383 [4.7%]; RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.31 to 1.44; P = 0.28; I² = 24%) (Table 2, Fig. 2 B and C). Sensitivity analyses focused on studies with low risk of bias were consistent with the main analyses (Figs. S3 – S4). The TSA for cardiac and non-cardiac surgery settings showed the need for further RCTs to draw a definitive conclusion (required sample size, 40,151 and 60,626, respectively). Visual inspection of the funnel plot suggested potential small-study effects in all the three settings (Figs. S5 – S7). The timeframe to observe mortality at the longest follow-up is summarized in Table S5 a. A sensitivity analysis based on the timeframe yielded similar findings with the main analysis (Table S5 b). Results of the other sensitivity analyses for mortality are summarized in Table S6. These sensitivity analyses did not materially change our findings.

Hydroxocobalamin (vitamin B12a) is an emerging treatment for vasoplegic syndrome (VS) associated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Given its cost and scarcity, an institutional guideline for its use as a rescue treatment in cases of suspected VS was developed. Hemodynamic variables and vasopressor requirements were reviewed for a series of 24 post-CPB patients who received B12a. Favorable changes in hemodynamic parameters and vasopressor requirements were seen after B12a administration although guideline criteria for VS were inconsistently met. These findings support the continued study of B12a in patients with CPB-associated VS.

Methylene blue

Inhibition of excessive production and activity of both NO and cGMP may be critical in the treatment of refractory vasodilatory shock occurring in cardiac bypass, septic shock, poisoning, and anaphylaxis patients. Methylene blue (MB) has several actions that may counteract the effect of increased NOS stimulation. First, it may antagonize endothelial NOS activity. Furthermore, it may scavenge NO directly and inhibit guanylate cyclase activity. Experimental animal studies report that, in addition to a reduction in vasopressor requirements, inotropic support is reduced after the administration of MB, likely due to attenuation of ischemia/reperfusion injury. In a human septic shock study, MAP and cardiac index were both found to be increased. A systematic review of the literature regarding the use of MB in sepsis by Kwok and Howes concluded that, while the studies were mostly observational, MB increased systemic vascular resistances and MAP; however, its effects on oxygen delivery and mortality are unknown. Moreover, all of the aforementioned studies are relatively old and likely do not take into account current recommendations.

The use of MB has been proposed not only for septic shock but also for treating vasoplegia after cardiac surgery, drug poisoning, anaphylactic shock, and post-reperfusion syndrome after liver transplantation. Similar to septic shock, however, data are currently insufficient to propose MB as a first line agent.

The potential dangers of treatments targeting iNOS overexpression in septic shock should nonetheless be kept in mind. For example, non-selective iNOS blockers, while improving systemic vascular resistance and MAP, also reduce cardiac output and increase mortality in patients with septic shock. Similarly, non-selective iNOS inhibition with tilarginine versus placebo in cardiogenic shock patients failed to reduce the mortality rate at 30 days. Interestingly, there was also no difference in hemodynamic outcomes such as duration of shock. This negative result may be the consequence of the inhibition of other beneficial NO isoforms.

Despite these limitations, the place of MB in vasoplegia treatment is currently being evaluated in a number of ongoing studies (NCT03038503, NCT01797978, NCT03120637).
