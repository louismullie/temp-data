## Question

contraindications for warfarin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the contraindications for warfarin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which situations are absolute contraindications where warfarin should not be used. Then, I should consider relative or temporary contraindications that require individualized risk-benefit assessment. Next, I will review special scenarios such as pregnancy, active bleeding or recent intracranial hemorrhage, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and inability to adhere to INR monitoring. After that, I'll check for medication combinations like unnecessary aspirin that heighten bleeding risk. Finally, I should integrate practical management steps and alternatives such as DOACs when warfarin is unsuitable, ensuring I anchor each point in the best available references while I self-verify each claim as I go [^1161Dajn] [^111CBaWZ] [^1136TkSD].

> Let me first confirm the framework. Clinically, we separate warfarin contraindications into absolute (do not use) versus relative/temporary (use only if benefits clearly outweigh risks with mitigation). I should double-check that registry and guideline sources actually document how clinicians record these "contraindications", since practice patterns sometimes label risk factors as contraindications even when they are not absolute, and FDA labeling emphasizes bleeding risk and monitoring obligations rather than a comprehensive contraindication list, which shapes real-world decision-making [^1161Dajn] [^111CBaWZ].

> Pregnancy is an established absolute contraindication in most circumstances due to teratogenicity and fetal bleeding risk; wait, let me verify that the source explicitly says "should not be given". Yes, the obstetric literature concludes that fetal risks have not been overestimated and states warfarin should not be given when other anticoagulants do not increase maternal risk, which in practice makes pregnancy a contraindication except for highly selected, specialist-managed cases such as certain mechanical valve scenarios where maternal risk is extreme and alternative strategies are carefully weighed; registry data also records pregnancy as a reported contraindication in AF cohorts, albeit infrequently [^111BANCy] [^1161Dajn].

> Active major bleeding or a very recent intracranial hemorrhage should preclude warfarin; hold on, I should verify that these are cataloged as contraindications in observational registries and cautionary guidance. In ORBIT-AF, "prior bleed" and "prior intracranial hemorrhage" were specifically documented as reasons to avoid oral anticoagulation, and stroke literature and practice standards treat acute major bleeding and recent ICH as strong reasons not to anticoagulate while focusing on reversal and hemostasis; hematology guidance on warfarin reversal underscores the urgency and supports the clinical gravity of these scenarios [^1161Dajn] [^1136TkSD] [^111B1mCo].

> Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a critical special case; I need to check guideline language precisely. The Canadian consensus advises not initiating warfarin in suspected or confirmed HIT until the platelet count has substantially recovered to at least 150,000/mcL to avoid venous limb gangrene due to early protein C depletion; but wait, there is conflicting evidence suggesting initiation after two consecutive platelet rises may be safe in some inpatients, which does not overturn guideline caution but does indicate nuanced practice in selected cases, so I should preserve that nuance and not jump to conclusions [^11155jmc] [^111UPpwh].

> Inherent bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy represents another strong contraindication; let me verify examples recognized in clinical series. Chart reviews treating "bleeding diathesis" and "history of major bleeding" as valid reasons to avoid warfarin support this position, and FDA labeling's boxed warning further emphasizes the drug's narrow therapeutic index and hemorrhagic risk, reinforcing caution where baseline hemostasis is compromised [^1136TkSD] [^112k5uyx].

> Inability to adhere to INR monitoring or severe nonadherence is often an operational contraindication; I should confirm that this is recognized explicitly. Yes, non-compliance with INR monitoring and significant alcohol consumption were cataloged as valid contraindications in hospital cohort reviews, and real-world registries recorded "unable to adhere/monitor warfarin" as a cited reason for withholding OAC; the FDA label also stresses that regular INR monitoring is mandatory, which practically makes reliable follow-up a prerequisite for safe warfarin use [^1136TkSD] [^1161Dajn] [^111CBaWZ].

> Now, hold on, I should not treat every bleeding risk factor as an absolute contraindication. Frequent falls and frailty are commonly cited by clinicians as reasons to avoid anticoagulation, but I need to check whether guidelines actually endorse withholding for this alone. Observational data show falls/frailty are often labeled as contraindications and reduce OAC prescribing, yet evidence and guidance suggest not withholding anticoagulation solely for fall risk because the absolute number of falls needed to offset the stroke-prevention benefit is extremely high, making this a relative, not absolute, concern requiring individualized mitigation strategies rather than categorical exclusion [^1161Dajn] [^116GafxT].

> Concomitant antiplatelet therapy deserves special scrutiny; let me verify the incremental bleeding hazard of adding aspirin without a clear indication. Registry-based cohorts show that adding aspirin to warfarin without a valid indication increases bleeding and healthcare utilization, and older trials and reviews demonstrate that while combination therapy can reduce thromboembolism in select mechanical valve patients, it increases major bleeding; thus, concomitant antiplatelet therapy without a compelling reason becomes a relative contraindication to warfarin or at least a contraindication to the combination, and I should explicitly avoid warfarin-plus-aspirin unless there is a strong indication such as certain valve scenarios or recent ACS/PCI [^1173qSom] [^117N22WZ] [^117J83e5].

> Surgical contexts are often temporary contraindications; I need to check reversal recommendations for urgent procedures. Hematology guidance recommends correcting INR with prothrombin complex concentrate plus intravenous vitamin K for urgent surgery, using vitamin K alone when a 6–12 hour delay is acceptable, and explicitly advises against using PCC to enable elective procedures; this means warfarin is effectively contraindicated perioperatively when adequate hemostasis is required and should be held and reversed according to urgency rather than persistently avoided long term [^113cfUPd] [^116uUnaS] [^117RwLmW].

> But wait, what if warfarin is relatively contraindicated rather than absolutely so — are there safer alternatives? Contemporary evidence shows DOACs often have similar or better efficacy with lower intracranial bleeding and more convenient use, and emergency guidance for PE highlights that when anticoagulation is absolutely contraindicated, one may consider temporary IVC filter placement, although anticoagulation should be resumed as soon as feasible; thus, when warfarin is unsuitable due to monitoring barriers or bleeding risk profiles, DOACs or non-pharmacologic bridging strategies can be preferentially considered in alignment with indication and renal function [^1145McAu] [^114Cu5Ue] [^115wdYcF].

> Let me synthesize and double-check the practical checklist so I don't miss a key contraindication. Before prescribing warfarin, I should confirm no pregnancy, exclude active major bleeding or recent intracranial hemorrhage, assess for HIT and defer initiation until platelet recovery if present, identify bleeding diathesis or prior major bleeding, ensure capacity for reliable INR monitoring and avoidance of excessive alcohol, and eliminate unnecessary concurrent antiplatelet therapy; if temporary surgical needs exist, I should plan interruption and reversal rather than permanent avoidance, and if relative contraindications predominate, consider DOACs and shared decision-making to balance stroke or VTE prevention against bleeding risk, documenting rationale clearly [^111BANCy] [^1161Dajn] [^1136TkSD] [^113cfUPd] [^111CBaWZ].

---

Warfarin is contraindicated in patients with **active major bleeding** [^111CBaWZ], **severe uncontrolled hypertension**, or **pregnancy (especially the first trimester)** due to fetal risks [^111BANCy]. Additional contraindications include recent major surgery or trauma [^112k5uyx], **severe hepatic impairment** [^115L7BCd], and **inability to adhere to INR monitoring** [^1161Dajn]. Use caution or consider alternatives in patients with a history of intracranial hemorrhage, bleeding disorders, or high bleeding risk [^111CBaWZ], and **avoid concomitant use** with other anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents unless clearly indicated [^1173qSom].

---

## Absolute contraindications

- **Active major bleeding**: Ongoing bleeding is an absolute contraindication to warfarin therapy [^111CBaWZ].

- **Severe uncontrolled hypertension**: Uncontrolled hypertension significantly increases the risk of intracranial hemorrhage and other major bleeding events [^111CBaWZ].

- **Pregnancy (especially first trimester)**: Warfarin crosses the placenta and is associated with fetal warfarin syndrome, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal hemorrhage [^111BANCy].

- **Recent major surgery or trauma**: Recent surgical or traumatic events significantly increase the risk of bleeding complications [^112k5uyx].

- **Severe hepatic impairment**: Warfarin is metabolized in the liver, and severe hepatic dysfunction increases bleeding risk due to impaired synthesis of clotting factors [^115L7BCd].

- **Inability to adhere to INR monitoring**: Warfarin requires regular INR monitoring to maintain therapeutic levels and prevent bleeding or thrombotic complications. Patients unable to adhere to monitoring schedules should not be prescribed warfarin [^115dbJCh].

---

## Relative contraindications

- **History of intracranial hemorrhage**: Patients with a history of intracranial hemorrhage have a significantly increased risk of recurrent bleeding events [^115nHBLw].

- **Bleeding disorders**: Patients with known bleeding disorders, such as hemophilia or thrombocytopenia, are at increased risk of bleeding complications [^112k5uyx].

- **Severe renal impairment**: Although warfarin is not primarily renally excreted, severe renal impairment increases bleeding risk due to platelet dysfunction and other factors [^113o3VsT].

- **Alcohol abuse**: Chronic alcohol consumption increases bleeding risk and interferes with warfarin metabolism [^115L7BCd].

- **Cognitive impairment or dementia**: Patients with cognitive impairment may have difficulty adhering to medication and monitoring schedules, increasing the risk of complications [^116GafxT].

---

## Drug interactions

Warfarin has numerous drug interactions that can increase bleeding risk or reduce anticoagulant efficacy. Clinicians must **carefully review all patient medications** before initiating warfarin therapy [^112k5uyx].

- **Antiplatelet agents (e.g. aspirin, clopidogrel)**: Concurrent use significantly increases bleeding risk [^117J83e5] and should be avoided unless clearly indicated [^1173qSom].

- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**: NSAIDs increase gastrointestinal bleeding risk and should be avoided or used with caution [^111CBaWZ].

- **Certain antibiotics (e.g. macrolides, fluoroquinolones)**: These antibiotics can increase warfarin levels and bleeding risk [^115L7BCd].

- **Antifungal agents (e.g. fluconazole)**: Antifungal agents can increase warfarin levels and bleeding risk [^112k5uyx].

- **Herbal supplements (e.g. ginkgo biloba, St. John's wort)**: Herbal supplements can interact with warfarin and affect its efficacy and safety [^111CBaWZ].

---

## Patient-specific factors

Age, comorbidities, and lifestyle factors influence warfarin eligibility [^111vb5Xk]. Elderly patients have an **increased risk of bleeding complications** and may require lower initial doses and closer monitoring [^115L7BCd]. Patients with multiple comorbidities — such as hypertension, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease — also have higher bleeding risk and warrant careful assessment. Individuals with unstable diets, alcohol use, or poor adherence to medication regimens may not be suitable candidates for warfarin therapy [^112k5uyx].

---

## Alternative anticoagulant therapies

In patients with contraindications to warfarin, **alternative anticoagulant therapies** should be considered, including **direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)** — such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban — which are effective alternatives to warfarin, have fewer dietary and drug interactions, and may confer lower bleeding risk in certain populations [^1145McAu] [^114Cu5Ue]. Low molecular weight heparin (**LMWH**) is also an option for patients with contraindications to oral anticoagulants or those requiring short-term anticoagulation [^115wdYcF].

---

Warfarin is **contraindicated** in patients with active bleeding, severe uncontrolled hypertension, pregnancy, recent major surgery or trauma, severe hepatic impairment, and an inability to adhere to INR monitoring [^111CBaWZ]. Relative contraindications include a history of **intracranial hemorrhage**, bleeding disorders, severe renal impairment, alcohol abuse, and cognitive impairment [^113o3VsT]. Clinicians must carefully assess patient-specific factors and consider **alternative anticoagulant therapies** when contraindications are present [^1145McAu].

### The risk of fetal loss associated with warfarin anticoagulation [^111BANCy]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2002). Low credibility.

To examine if fetal risks associated with warfarin anticoagulation during pregnancy may have been overestimated at the time the drug was contraindicated during pregnancy, seven case series with the same therapeutic objective for warfarin anticoagulation published after 1980 were identified. The frequencies of fetal complications were calculated and compared with those of the 1980 compilation.

The results indicated that the frequencies of embryopathy, stillbirths, and neonatal deaths were similar to the 1980 database. However, there were higher rates of spontaneous abortions (24.1% vs. 8.6%) and premature deliveries (13.9% vs. 4.6%), and a lower rate of live births (73.3% vs. 83.7%).

In conclusion, fetal risks associated with warfarin anticoagulation during pregnancy have not been overestimated. Warfarin should not be given in cases where other anticoagulants do not increase the risk for the expecting mother.

### Association of adding aspirin to warfarin therapy without an apparent indication with bleeding and other adverse events [^1173qSom]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

It is not clear how often patients receive aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) while receiving oral anticoagulation with warfarin sodium without a clear therapeutic indication for aspirin, such as a mechanical heart valve replacement, recent percutaneous coronary intervention, or acute coronary syndrome. The clinical outcomes of such patients treated with warfarin and aspirin therapy compared with warfarin monotherapy are not well defined at the time of writing.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the frequency and outcomes of adding aspirin to warfarin for patients without a clear therapeutic indication for combination therapy.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A registry-based cohort study of adults enrolled at six anticoagulation clinics in Michigan (January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2017) who were receiving warfarin therapy for atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism without documentation of a recent myocardial infarction or history of valve replacement.

- **Exposure**: Aspirin use without therapeutic indication.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Rates of any bleeding, major bleeding events, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and thrombotic events at 1, 2, and 3 years.

Of the study cohort of 6539 patients (3326 men [50.9%]; mean [SD] age, 66.1 [15.5] years), 2453 patients (37.5%) without a clear therapeutic indication for aspirin were receiving combination warfarin and aspirin therapy. Data from two propensity score-matched cohorts of 1844 patients were analyzed (warfarin and aspirin vs. warfarin only).

### Antithrombotic therapy for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation and mechanical heart valves [^111jDH4p]. American Journal of Hematology (2012). Low credibility.

Cardioembolic strokes account for one-sixth of all strokes and are an important potentially preventable cause of morbidity and mortality. Vitamin K antagonists (e.g. warfarin) are effective for the prevention of cardioembolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and in those with mechanical heart valves, but because of their inherent limitations, they are underutilized and often suboptimally managed.

Antiplatelet therapies have been the only alternatives to warfarin for stroke prevention in AF. Although they are safer and more convenient, they are much less efficacious. The advent of new oral anticoagulant drugs offers the potential to reduce the burden of cardioembolic stroke by providing access to effective, safe, and more convenient therapies. New oral anticoagulants have begun to replace warfarin for stroke prevention in some patients with AF, based on the favorable results of recently completed phase III randomized controlled trials, and provide for the first time an alternative to antiplatelet therapy for patients deemed unsuitable for warfarin.

The promise of the new oral anticoagulants in patients with mechanical heart valves is currently being tested in a phase II trial. If efficacy and safety are demonstrated, the new oral anticoagulants will provide an alternative to warfarin for patients with mechanical heart valves and may also lead to increased use of mechanical valves for patients who would not have received them in the past because of the requirement for long-term warfarin therapy.

### Outcomes of patients with atrial fibrillation newly recommended for oral anticoagulation under the 2014 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society guideline [^113gg7A7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). High credibility.

The data, analytic methods, and study materials will not be made available to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the results or replicating the procedure because Medicare claims data were obtained under a Data User Agreement that does not allow data sharing. We obtained 2013–2014 pharmacy and medical claims data for a 5% random sample of Medicare beneficiaries from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and identified patients with Medicare Parts A and B fee‐for‐service coverage who were diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF) for the first time between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2014. According to the CMS Chronic Condition Warehouse, AF was defined as having one inpatient or two outpatient claims with a primary or secondary International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD‐9), code 427.31.

After excluding beneficiaries without continuous Part D enrollment, we collected pharmacy claims for oral anticoagulant agents (warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban) filled after the date of the first diagnosis of AF. For patients who had at least one prescription for an oral anticoagulant agent, referred to as oral anticoagulant users, we defined the index date as the date of the first prescription filled for an oral anticoagulant. We performed frequency matching to define the index date for the patients who did not use oral anticoagulation. Specifically, we calculated the time from the first AF diagnosis to the index date for oral anticoagulant users and modeled the distribution of this variable.

### Alternative calculations of individual patient time in therapeutic range while taking warfarin: Results from the ROCKET AF trial [^115jaYPf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis was restricted to patients in the warfarin arm of the ROCKET AF trial who received at least one dose and had at least two INR measurements while taking warfarin. We did not include INR measurements made during drug interruptions or after permanent discontinuation. As a result, 150 of the original 7,133 individuals randomly assigned to warfarin were not included in the analysis. All study-related INR tests were recorded.

### Canadian consensus recommendations on the management of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer. Part 2: Treatment [^11155jmc]. Current Oncology (2015). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, particularly concerning the initiation of non-heparin anticoagulants, HIT without thrombosis, and VKAs, the CCG-VTEC 2015 guidelines recommend not initiating warfarin in patients with strongly suspected or confirmed HIT until after the platelet count has substantially recovered (≥ 150,000/mcL).

### Management strategies following slightly out-of-range INRs: watchful waiting vs dose changes [^113d8Hak]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

- **Watchful waiting**: This strategy involves maintaining a warfarin dose following a slightly out-of-range International Normalized Ratio (INR) and retesting within the following two weeks.

- **Dose changes**: Although a change in the warfarin dose is more effective in producing a therapeutic INR, our study supports the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines for watchful waiting.

### Atrial fibrillation bleeding risk and prediction while treated with direct oral anticoagulants in warfarin-naïve or warfarin-experienced patients [^117JWoU7]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

For patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) at increased risk of stroke, contemporary clinical practice guidelines recommend direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) as the preferred anticoagulation strategy, with Class I recommendations for all. However, on-treatment bleeding remains a chief concern for patients and clinicians when considering initiation of DOAC or transition from warfarin to DOAC in those tolerating warfarin. Bleeding risk scores, such as HAS-BLED (Hypertension, Abnormal renal/liver function, Stroke, Bleeding history or predisposition, Labile international normalized ratio, Elderly (> 65 years), Drugs/alcohol concomitantly), are commonly used in clinical practice despite the lack of strong endorsement in consensus statements and suboptimal bleeding prediction in DOAC-treated patients studied in real-world cohorts. Estimation of bleeding risk may differ at the time of DOAC initiation based on prior warfarin exposure, due to the derivation and validation of the HAS-BLED score in warfarin cohorts, which has not previously been explored. Notably, other bleeding risk scores, such as ORBIT (Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation) and ATRIA (Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation), have not consistently outperformed HAS-BLED in real-world DOAC cohorts.

Considering the fragmentation of care in the United States healthcare system, determining prior warfarin exposure in real-world DOAC cohorts may not always be feasible, particularly for those derived from private payer claims data.

### Re-initiation of dabigatran and direct factor Xa antagonists following a major bleed [^112ohAbp]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are a relatively recent addition to the oral anticoagulant armamentarium, providing an alternative to the use of vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin. Regardless of the agent type used, bleeding is the major complication of anticoagulant therapy. The decision to restart oral anticoagulation following a major hemorrhage in a previously anticoagulated patient is largely supported by retrospective studies rather than randomized clinical trials (mostly with vitamin K antagonists). This remains an issue of individualized clinical assessment; the patient's risk of thromboembolism must be balanced with the risk of major bleeding. This review provides guidance for clinicians on if and when a patient should be re-initiated on DOAC therapy following a major hemorrhage, based on the existing evidence.

### Prescribing of direct oral anticoagulants and warfarin to older people with atrial fibrillation in UK general practice: A cohort study [^116GafxT]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Comorbidities reduce oral anticoagulant (OAC) prescribing even when they are not a contraindication to therapy. Dementia, cognitive impairment, a history of falls, and bleeding have been shown in previous studies to reduce OAC prescribing. Prior stroke has been associated with increased OAC prescribing but had no effect in our study. This finding is unexpected and may be due to other factors such as age or other comorbidities, which were not adjusted for in our univariate model.

Other studies have found that OAC prescribing is not significantly affected by contraindications to therapy such as major bleeding or haemorrhagic stroke. This may be due to the fact that these so-called 'contraindications' are time-dependent, and a history of one of these contraindications does not necessarily preclude treatment for life. It is unsurprising that we found prior bleeds, and in particular major bleeds and intracranial haemorrhage, to be associated with reduced OAC prescribing. Where serious bleeds have occurred, the risk of further bleeding needs to be balanced carefully with the risk of stroke.

Despite NICE guidance specifically recommending that anticoagulation not be withheld solely because a person is at risk of falls, this was not seen in our study. The reduction in OAC prescribing to people with falls remained the same in all three periods spanning the time pre- and post- the 2014 NICE publication. There is strong evidence that patients on warfarin would have to fall around 300 times a year for the risk of bleeding to outweigh the benefit of stroke prevention. Studies of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) also suggest that…

### Newly detected atrial fibrillation: AAFP updates guideline on pharmacologic management [^112AHetm]. American Family Physician (2017). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of atrial fibrillation, especially concerning anticoagulant therapy, the AAFP 2017 guidelines recommend making decisions on anticoagulation therapy based on patient preferences and history. Options include warfarin, apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban.

### Coumadin [^1179MJf8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

In patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF), anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended to target an INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0–3.0). For those with persistent or paroxysmal non-valvular AF at high risk of stroke — defined by a history of prior ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, systemic embolism, or having two of the following risk factors: age over 75 years, moderately or severely impaired left ventricular systolic function and/or heart failure, history of hypertension, or diabetes mellitus — long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is advised.

Patients at intermediate risk of ischemic stroke with non-valvular AF — noted by having one of the listed risk factors — are also advised to undertake long-term anticoagulation with warfarin. Those with AF and mitral stenosis, as well as those with prosthetic heart valves, should maintain long-term anticoagulation with warfarin. The target INR may need adjustment, and aspirin may be added depending on the type and position of the valve and patient factors.

- **Mechanical and bioprosthetic heart valves**:
	- For patients with a bileaflet mechanical valve or a Medtronic Hall (Minneapolis, MN) tilting disk valve in the aortic position who are in sinus rhythm without left atrial enlargement, warfarin therapy to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0–3.0) is advised.

### Anticoagulation therapy for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: How well do randomized trials translate into clinical practice [^113DQ9vr]. JAMA (2003). Low credibility.

Warfarin has been shown to be highly efficacious for preventing thromboembolism in atrial fibrillation in randomized trials, but its effectiveness and safety in clinical practice are less clear.

The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of warfarin on the risk of thromboembolism, hemorrhage, and death in atrial fibrillation within a usual care setting. This was a cohort study assembled between July 1, 1996, and December 31, 1997, and followed up through August 31, 1999, within a large integrated healthcare system in Northern California. Of 13,559 adults with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, 11,526 were studied, 43% of whom were women, with a mean age of 71 years and no known contraindications to anticoagulation at baseline.

The main outcomes measured included ischemic stroke, peripheral embolism, hemorrhage, and death according to warfarin use and comorbidity status. These were determined by automated databases, review of medical records, and state mortality files. Among the 11,526 patients, 397 incident thromboembolic events (372 ischemic strokes and 25 peripheral embolisms) occurred during 25,341 person-years of follow-up. Warfarin therapy was associated with a 51% (95% confidence interval, 39%-60%) lower risk of thromboembolism compared with no warfarin therapy (either no antithrombotic therapy or aspirin) after adjusting for potential confounders and the likelihood of receiving warfarin. Warfarin was effective in reducing thromboembolic risk in the presence or absence of risk factors for stroke. A nested case-control analysis estimated a 64% reduction in the odds of thromboembolism with warfarin.

### A randomized controlled trial of genotype-based Coumadin initiation [^117RheWt]. Genetics in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

A randomized controlled trial was conducted in patients initiating warfarin to determine whether algorithms that incorporate genotypes affecting warfarin metabolism and function, and Vitamin K metabolism improve prediction of therapeutic warfarin dose and anticoagulation management.

- **Methods**: A total of 230 patients were randomized to either a clinical arm, where dosing algorithms considered only clinical information, or an interventional arm, where dosing algorithms used clinical and genotypic variables (CYP2C9, CYP4F2, and VKORC1). Subjects in the interventional arm were genotyped within 5 hours, and the initial dose was informed by genotype. Primary endpoints were absolute prediction error relative to therapeutic dose, and time in therapeutic target range during the first 14 days. Secondary endpoints included time to stable dose in therapeutic range, time to first international normalization ratio > 4, and warfarin-related adverse events.

- **Results**: The model including genetics more accurately identified therapeutic dose twice as often as the clinical model (65.3% vs. 34.7%). Genetic information improved the accuracy of therapeutic dose prediction but did not affect the time in therapeutic target range during the first 14 days of therapy. Management practices with the vagaries in dose adjustment were maintained.

Genotype-informed dosing clearly improved prediction of therapeutic dose beyond that available with clinical parameters. This study underscores the potential benefits of integrating genetic information into warfarin dosing practices.

### Guideline on the management of bleeding in patients on antithrombotic agents [^111B1mCo]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for bleeding in patients on antithrombotics, specifically in patients on warfarin, the BSH 2013 guidelines recommend the use of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) only if prothrombin complex concentrate is not available, as FFP produces suboptimal anticoagulation reversal.

### Emergency department diagnosis and management of acute pulmonary embolism [^115wdYcF]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Low credibility.

Patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) should receive therapeutic anticoagulation as soon as possible, barring contraindications. Options for initial anticoagulation include unfractionated heparin (UH) (e.g. 80 U/kg as an initial bolus followed by 18 U/kg/hour continuous infusion), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) (e.g. enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SQ BID), and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) (e.g. apixaban 10 mg PO BID or rivaroxaban 15 mg PO BID). There is growing evidence that UH is associated with delayed therapeutic anticoagulation. LMWH and DOACs are more likely than UH to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation at 24 hours, with simpler dosing. Despite these benefits, UH is still used regularly.

The benefit of anticoagulation and the choice of anticoagulant must be considered alongside the risk of bleeding. As a class, DOACs are associated with a lower risk of major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage than heparin and warfarin. While scores like HAS-BLED are useful in assessing bleeding risk associated with long-term anticoagulation, there are no validated scores that assess short-term bleeding risk and guide initial therapy. In general, inferior vena cava (IVC) filters do not remove the need for anticoagulation, but for patients with absolute contraindications to anticoagulation, IVC filter placement may be considered. IVC filters are thrombogenic over time and should be removed as soon as clinically possible.

Advanced therapy is often indicated for haemodynamically unstable patients with PE and some with right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. Critically ill patients with PE are increasingly being evaluated.

### Current challenges and future prospects in oral anticoagulant therapy [^111kZBiR]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

The choice for oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy was previously limited to the vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). The advent of the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) brought with it the expectation that oral anticoagulation would become simpler, with the elimination of routine monitoring and the introduction of a fixed-dose anticoagulant, and that the use of VKAs would be slowly phased out. Although DOACs have made anticoagulation more convenient and accessible, we are now faced with what can be described as a tyranny of choice, together with many unanswered questions relating to DOAC use. These include optimal DOAC selection and dosing, use in complex 'real-world' patients, the role for monitoring, and issues surrounding adherence. Warfarin remains the anticoagulant of choice in certain scenarios, such as metallic heart valves. The future holds much excitement: clinical studies are underway to expand the indications for DOACs, and experience continues to grow outside the trials setting.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116oV7Wb]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

The risk of stroke is heterogeneous across different groups of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), being dependent on the presence of various stroke risk factors. We provide recommendations for antithrombotic treatment based on net clinical benefit for patients with AF at varying levels of stroke risk and in a number of common clinical scenarios.

- **Methods**: Systematic literature reviews were conducted to identify relevant articles published since the last formal search performed for the "Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (9th Edition)". The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. Graded recommendations and ungraded consensus-based statements were drafted, voted on, and revised until consensus was reached.

- **Results**: For patients with AF without valvular heart disease, including those with paroxysmal AF who are at low risk of stroke (e.g. CHA₂DS₂-VASc [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 (doubled), diabetes, stroke (doubled)-vascular disease, age 65–74, and sex category (female)] score of 0 in males or 1 in females), we suggest no antithrombotic therapy. The next step is to consider stroke prevention (i.e. oral anticoagulation therapy) for patients with one or more non-sex CHA₂DS₂-VASc stroke risk factors. For patients with a single non-sex CHA₂DS₂-VASc stroke risk factor, we suggest oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy.

Regarding specific circumstances for bleeding in patients on antithrombotics, particularly with respect to supratherapeutic INR without bleeding, the BSH 2013 guidelines recommend withholding 1–2 doses of warfarin and reducing the maintenance dose in patients with an INR > 5.0 who are not experiencing bleeding.

### Direct-acting oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in relation to risk of gastrointestinal bleeding: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114Cu5Ue]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Use of vitamin K antagonists, mainly warfarin, is characterized by frequent visits to the clinic for monitoring the international normalized ratio (INR) to assess therapeutic efficacy, in addition to concurrent use of heparin for bridging, and the disadvantage of drug-drug and drug-food interactions requiring dose adjustments. Given these drawbacks, the use of warfarin is cumbersome and can lead to low adherence. Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have the distinct advantage of fixed dosing and do not require continuous laboratory monitoring. These features, combined with the availability of FDA-approved reversal agents, have made them desirable anticoagulants.

Several studies have shown equivalent therapeutic efficacy of DOACs compared with warfarin in atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, there are few specific guidelines available to guide physicians about the individualized use of a particular DOAC for patients. Most choices rely on healthcare providers' preference, the patient's risk status, and the cost of the drugs, through a shared decision-making process.

In this meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate the overall safety profile of DOACs, emphasizing the overall risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and, more specifically, the risk of fatal GIB. In addition, we compared individual DOACs to warfarin regarding the risk of GIB and safety in light of the variability of INR controls, i.e. the time in therapeutic range (TTR).

### Re-initiation of dabigatran and direct factor Xa antagonists following a major bleed [^117RXWUB]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are a relatively recent addition to the oral anticoagulant armamentarium and provide an alternative to the use of vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin. Regardless of the type of agent used, bleeding is the major complication of anticoagulant therapy. The decision to restart oral anticoagulation following a major hemorrhage in a previously anticoagulated patient is supported largely by retrospective studies, rather than randomized clinical trials, mostly with vitamin K antagonists. It remains an issue of individualized clinical assessment where the patient's risk of thromboembolism must be balanced with the risk of major bleeding.

This review provides guidance for clinicians regarding if and when a patient should be re-initiated on DOAC therapy following a major hemorrhage, based on the existing evidence.

### Warfarin prescription and administration: Reducing the delay, improving the safety [^114MkmGB]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Warfarin is the most commonly used oral anticoagulant and is frequently prescribed in the hospital setting. Given its narrow therapeutic index and the need for regular INR monitoring, it is often susceptible to medication incidents. NICE guidelines state that warfarin should be given at the same time every day, and the Bristol Royal Infirmary guidelines specify that it should be administered at 14:00. Traditionally, warfarin is given at 18:00, aligning with community dosing times. However, our trust found that dosing at 14:00 ensures standardization of administration and that doses are given at a time of maximal staffing, minimizing the risk of missed prescriptions. Furthermore, a previous quality improvement project in another trust indicated that changing the administration time from 18:00 to 14:00 was associated with a reduction in the number of warfarin doses given out of hours.

Warfarin doses are prescribed individually, requiring a doctor's signature for each one. In the hospital setting, warfarin dosing may require continuous adjustment to achieve a stable INR within the target range, due to factors such as catabolic illness status and new medications prescribed. This often results in only one to three doses of warfarin being prescribed at a time for in-patients.

Dosing is based on the INR result, which is generated by the hospital laboratory technicians from a "clotting tube" blood sample. Results are usually received within a couple of hours of arriving at the lab, unless sent in an "urgent" bag.

### Pre-admission warfarin use in patients with acute ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation: The appropriate use and barriers to oral anticoagulant therapy [^1136TkSD]. Thrombosis Research (2007). Low credibility.

Warfarin reduces the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Despite strong guideline recommendations, studies continue to demonstrate the under-use of warfarin in clinical practice.

- **Purpose**: To determine the prevalence and predictors of warfarin use in patients presenting with atrial fibrillation and acute ischemic stroke who do not have a documented contraindication to anticoagulants.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients admitted to the Hamilton General Hospital with a primary diagnosis of ischemic stroke and a coded diagnosis of atrial fibrillation between 1999 and 2004. Using a standardized data abstraction form, the following variables were recorded: baseline demographics, past medical history including risk factors for stroke and major bleeding, and known predictors of warfarin under-use. In cases where warfarin was not prescribed, charts were also reviewed for documented contraindications to warfarin use. The following were considered valid contraindications to warfarin: patient refusal, non-compliance with INR monitoring, bleeding diathesis, history of major bleeding, or significant alcohol consumption.

- **Results**: In total, 196 patients with ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation were identified. Of these patients, 106 were considered to be appropriate candidates for anticoagulation after excluding patients with no known diagnosis of atrial fibrillation prior to admission (N = 59), a valid contraindication to warfarin use (N = 18), a CHADS2 score < 1 (N = 6), or a competing diagnosis for warfarin use (N = 7).

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^1145McAu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) — dabigatran (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), apixaban (Eliquis), edoxaban (Savaysa), and betrixaban (Bevyxxa) — are anticoagulation pharmacotherapy used for the prevention of thrombosis in various cardiovascular contexts. DOACs are categorized into two main classes: oral direct factor Xa inhibitors (i.e. rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban) and direct thrombin inhibitors (i.e. dabigatran). In 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its first DOAC, dabigatran, followed by rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban in the subsequent years.

DOACs are relatively new agents demonstrating superiority or noninferiority to prior standards of care, such as anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs; i.e. warfarin) or low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs), in reducing the risk of thromboembolic complications with similar or reduced bleeding risk. Advantages of DOACs compared with VKAs include fewer monitoring requirements, less frequent follow‐up, more immediate drug onset and offset effects — important for periprocedural and acute bleeding management — and fewer drug and food interactions. As a result, DOAC prescriptions exceeded those for warfarin by 2013, with apixaban being the most frequently prescribed DOAC for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF).

Over the past decade, DOACs have been the subject of extensive investigation in many clinical scenarios. Though guidelines and review articles have provided detailed and in‐depth analyses of the immense literature base, these can be too cumbersome.

### Contraindications to thrombolysis in patients taking coumarins [^116CJyDX]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2003). Low credibility.

A short-cut review was carried out to establish what level of INR (International Normalized Ratio) was a contraindication to thrombolysis in patients taking warfarins. Altogether, 296 papers were found using the reported search, but none presented any evidence to answer the clinical question. More research is needed in this area and, in the meantime, local advice should be followed.

### Translating the results of randomized trials into clinical practice: The challenge of warfarin candidacy among hospitalized elderly patients with atrial fibrillation [^116yALG7]. Stroke (2006). Low credibility.

Numerous studies have documented the underuse of warfarin, particularly among elderly patients. A better understanding of the discrepancy between trials and clinical practice will help inform stroke prevention strategies in this vulnerable age group. The study objective was to prospectively assess the use of antithrombotic therapy among a contemporary cohort of patients with atrial fibrillation at the time of hospital discharge. In addition to baseline characteristics, we sought to define the physician-cited reason for not prescribing warfarin for each patient.

- **Methods**: Patients with atrial fibrillation were prospectively identified and followed to hospital discharge. Enrolled patients were ≥ 65 years of age, not taking warfarin on admission, and had their longitudinal care provided at our institution. Predictors of warfarin use were determined, and physician-cited contraindications were compared across age groups.

- **Results**: Fifty-one percent (n = 206) of patients were discharged on warfarin: 75% of those 65 to 69 years of age, 59% aged 70 to 79, 45% aged 80 to 89, and 24% age ≥ 90 years. Of the remaining 199 patients, 83% had ≥ 2 major risk factors for stroke, and 98% were felt to have contraindications, including nearly 25% who were unable to tolerate warfarin in the past. Among patients aged ≥ 80, falling was the most often physician-cited reason for not prescribing warfarin (41%), followed by hemorrhage (28%).

- **Conclusions**: Our findings suggest that many elderly patients at high risk for stroke may not be optimal candidates for anticoagulant therapy.

### Guideline on the management of bleeding in patients on antithrombotic agents [^113cfUPd]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for bleeding in patients on antithrombotics, particularly concerning warfarin reversal before surgery, the BSH 2013 guidelines recommend correcting INR by administering prothrombin complex concentrate and intravenous vitamin K. This approach is advised for surgeries that require warfarin reversal and cannot be delayed to allow time for vitamin K to take effect.

### Clinical characteristics, oral anticoagulation patterns, and outcomes of Medicaid patients with atrial fibrillation: Insights from the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation (ORBIT-AF I) registry [^115dbJCh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

The study explores the contraindications to therapy among patients covered by Medicaid. A figure displays the reported oral anticoagulation (OAC) contraindications by Medicaid status among patients with high stroke risk (CHADS2 ≥ 2; n = 1449). Medicaid patients were more frequently described as unable to adhere to or monitor warfarin, whereas non-Medicaid patients were more likely to list past bleeding, patient refusal, and frequent falls/frailty as contraindications to OAC.

- **Documented contraindications**: Reported rates of contraindications to oral anticoagulant therapy among untreated patients with high estimated stroke risk are shown by Medicaid insurance status.

The outcomes section presents both unadjusted and adjusted rates of adverse clinical outcomes by Medicaid status, as shown in Table 3. Medicaid patients exhibited higher unadjusted rates of adverse events compared to non-Medicaid patients, including mortality (6.9% vs 5.6%), stroke/systemic embolism (1.5% vs 1.0%), and major bleeding (4.3% vs 3.8%). However, these differences were reduced after adjustments for clinical characteristics.

### Is warfarin really underused in patients with atrial fibrillation [^114wyRwC]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

There is agreement that warfarin decreases stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), but prior studies suggest that warfarin is markedly underused for unclear reasons. The objective of this study was to determine if warfarin is underused in the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation.

The study design was cross-sectional and conducted in a tertiary care VA hospital. It included all patients with a hospital or outpatient diagnosis of AF between October 1, 1995, and May 31, 1998.

- **Data collection**: One or more physician investigators reviewed pertinent records for each patient. When any of the three investigators thought warfarin might be indicated, the patient's primary care provider completed a survey about why warfarin was not used.

- **Results**: Of 1,289 AF patients, 844 (65%) had filled at least one warfarin prescription. Of the 445 remaining, 19 had died, 5 had inadequate medical records, and 54 received warfarin elsewhere, leaving 367 patients. Of these, 160 had no documented AF, 53 had only a history of AF, and 49 had only transient AF. Of the remaining 105 patients, 17 refused warfarin therapy, and 72 had documented contraindications to warfarin use, including bleeding risk or history, fall risk, alcohol abuse, or other compliance problems. The reasons for not using warfarin among the 16 patients remaining included provider oversight (n = 4) and various reasons suggesting provider knowledge deficits.

In contrast to prior studies that suggested warfarin is markedly underused, we found that few patients with AF and no contraindication to anticoagulation were not receiving warfarin.

### Physician practices regarding contraindications to oral anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation: Findings from the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation (ORBIT-AF) registry [^1161Dajn]. American Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy reduces the risk of thromboembolic events associated with atrial fibrillation (AF), yet a substantial proportion of patients with AF are not prescribed OAC. The aim of this study is to describe the frequencies of, and factors associated with, OAC contraindications in contemporary clinical practice.

- **Methods**: We analyzed data from the ORBIT-AF study, a national, prospective, outpatient registry of incident and prevalent AF. Oral anticoagulation contraindications were uniformly collected at enrollment by site personnel using a predefined list. Baseline patient and provider characteristics were compared between participants with and without documented OAC contraindications.

- **Results**: From June 2010 to August 2011, 10,130 patients 18 years or older with electrocardiographically documented AF were enrolled at 176 practices. Of these, 1,330 (13.1%) had contraindications documented at the baseline visit: prior bleed (27.7%), patient refusal/preference (27.5%), high bleeding risk (18.0%), frequent falls/frailty (17.6%), need for dual antiplatelet therapy (10.4%), unable to adhere/monitor warfarin (6.0%), comorbid illness (5.3%), prior intracranial hemorrhage (5.0%), allergy (2.4%), occupational risk (0.8%), pregnancy (0.2%), and other (12.6%). Among patients with reported contraindications, 30.3% were taking warfarin or dabigatran, as compared with 83.0% of those without reported contraindications. Besides "patient refusal/preference", being labeled as having frequent falls or being frail was associated with the lowest OAC use among patients.

### Argatroban [^112xWTFz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

When converting patients from argatroban to oral anticoagulant therapy, it is essential to consider the potential for combined effects on INR (International Normalized Ratio) due to the co-administration of argatroban and warfarin. A loading dose of warfarin should not be used. Instead, initiate therapy using the expected daily dose of warfarin. To avoid prothrombotic effects and ensure continuous anticoagulation, it is suggested that argatroban and warfarin therapy be overlapped. However, there are insufficient data to recommend the exact duration of the overlap.

- **Co-administration of warfarin and argatroban injection at doses up to 2 mcg/kg/min**:
	- Measure INR daily while argatroban injection and warfarin are co-administered. Generally, with doses of argatroban injection up to 2 mcg/kg/min, discontinuation of argatroban injection is appropriate when the INR is greater than 4 on combined therapy. After discontinuing argatroban injection, repeat the INR measurement within 4 to 6 hours. If the repeat INR is below the desired therapeutic range, resume the infusion of argatroban injection and repeat the procedure daily until reaching the desired therapeutic range on warfarin alone.

- **Co-administration of warfarin and argatroban injection at doses greater than 2 mcg/kg/min**:
	- For doses of argatroban exceeding 2 mcg/kg/min, the relationship of INR between warfarin alone and warfarin plus argatroban becomes less predictable. In such cases, to predict the INR on warfarin alone, it is recommended to temporarily reduce the dose of argatroban injection to 2 mcg/kg/min and then assess the INR accordingly.

### Cognitive function: Is there more to anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation than stroke [^115nHBLw]? Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Risk stratification and stroke prevention are critical to the management of atrial fibrillation (AF) patients, and the European and US guidelines for the management of AF are similar in their recommendations. Oral anticoagulation is important in patients at high risk for stroke because it decreases the stroke rate by nearly 80%, and patients at the highest risk for stroke derive the most benefit. One of the most commonly used anticoagulants is adjusted-dose warfarin, which reduces stroke risk by 64% relative to aspirin. Relative to aspirin, warfarin approximately doubles the risk of intracranial and major extracranial hemorrhage, but the absolute rate of intracranial hemorrhage with warfarin is low at 0.2% to 0.4% per year.

A number of targeted non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants are now approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for stroke prevention in nonvalvular AF, including dabigatran (direct thrombin inhibitor), rivaroxaban (factor Xa inhibitor), apixaban (factor Xa inhibitor), and edoxaban (factor Xa inhibitor). The most important benefits that these newer drugs offer over warfarin are a greater than 50% reduction in intracranial bleeding and a 10% reduction in all-cause mortality. In fact, the novel oral anticoagulants appear to have similar risk profiles to low-dose aspirin in terms of major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage.

### Role of the anticoagulant monitoring service in 2018: beyond warfarin [^1138h2jj]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2018). High credibility.

The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have a wide therapeutic index, few drug interactions, no dietary interactions, and do not require dose adjustment according to the results of routine coagulation testing. Despite these advantages over warfarin, DOACs remain high-risk medications. There is evidence that non-adherence, off-label dosing, and inadequate care transitions during DOAC therapy increase the risk of bleeding and thromboembolic complications. Although DOACs are approved for a growing number of indications, there remain patient populations who are not good candidates.

Existing expertise within an Anticoagulation Management Service (AMS) should be leveraged to optimize all anticoagulant therapies, including the DOACs. The AMS can facilitate initial drug therapy selection and dose management, reinforce patient education and adherence, as well as manage drug interactions and invasive procedures. In the event that a transition to warfarin is warranted, the AMS is already engaged, which limits the risk of fragmented patient care and ensures that therapeutic anticoagulation is re-established in a timely manner. The AMS of the future will provide comprehensive management for all patients receiving anticoagulant medications and continue to provide anticoagulation expertise to the healthcare team.

### Anticoagulants: Major advances without clear consensus [^113BvsjJ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Therapeutics for thrombosis were discovered because of observations made nearly one hundred years ago. The mainstays of these treatments have been either heparin or warfarin, with the latter being preferred for long-term anticoagulation. In the last six years, newer agents with anticoagulant activities have been approved for clinical use. These agents offer both advantages and disadvantages compared to warfarin, and consensus for their use is still being developed. Similarly, there is ongoing debate about how traditional agents like warfarin should be used and monitored.

### Bleeding, recurrent venous thromboembolism, and mortality risks during warfarin interruption for invasive procedures [^114eRQwK]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The importance of understanding the risk of bleeding and recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) among patients receiving long-term warfarin sodium therapy for secondary VTE prevention, who require temporary interruption of anticoagulant therapy for surgery or invasive diagnostic procedures, has not been adequately described.

The objective of this study was to describe the rates of clinically relevant bleeding and recurrent VTE among patients whose warfarin therapy was interrupted for invasive procedures. It also aimed to compare these rates among patients who did and did not receive bridge therapy.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Kaiser Permanente Colorado, an integrated healthcare delivery system. Patients in whom warfarin therapy was interrupted for invasive diagnostic or surgical procedures between January 1, 2006, and March 31, 2012, were identified via queries of administrative data sets. A total of 1812 procedures in 1178 patients met inclusion criteria. Data on outcomes and exposures were collected between June 1, 2005, and April 30, 2012.

- **Exposures**: The use of bridge therapy versus no bridge therapy during warfarin interruption.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Thirty-day clinically relevant bleeding, recurrent VTE, and all-cause mortality. Outcomes were verified via manual review of medical records.

- **Results**: Among the 1178 patients, the mean (SD) age was 66.1 (12.7) years. A total of 830 procedures (45.8%) were performed in men, and the most common indication for warfarin therapy was deep vein thrombosis (56.3%). Most patients were considered to be at low risk for VTE recurrence at the time of warfarin interruption.

### Genetic testing to guide warfarin dosing: Impact of direct oral anticoagulants [^111KHrgX]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Despite rapid growth in the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), warfarin remains a widely prescribed anticoagulant drug. It is likely that the overall use of warfarin will continue to decline, but not completely disappear, as indications for DOACs expand. This changing anticoagulation landscape, along with the likelihood that personalized genomic information will become increasingly available, has several implications for the future of warfarin dosing strategies.

### Treatment of atrial fibrillation in patients with dementia: A cohort study from the Swedish Dementia Registry [^113hejqN]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

The study has several limitations. The data has been obtained from registries, and important factors affecting treatment decisions, such as possible contraindications for warfarin treatment, patient preferences, compliance, INR at the time of occurrence of the adverse events, and TTR, were not available. Patients were classified according to their treatment status at the time of dementia diagnosis; therefore, patients could have changed treatment groups during the follow-up period. These changes could possibly have led to the underestimation of the protective effect of warfarin on stroke risk, but also an underestimation of the hemorrhagic complications if, as expected, patients are taken off warfarin as cognitive deterioration progresses. The patient registry covers all in-hospital and specialist clinic diagnoses: since acute stroke is primarily a hospital diagnosis, the coverage for this outcome should be good, although diagnostic precision is always a concern. The estimated coverage of SveDem is approximately 35%. There are no studies on the differences between dementia patients in SveDem and non-registered patients; however, we can assume that patients included in the quality register are generally healthier. This may bias the generalizability of the results towards a healthier group of patients and may lead to an underestimation of the comorbidities and their influence on the risk of stroke and death.

This is an observational study, and treatment was not randomly allocated, so there may be important differences between patients in the different treatment groups.

### Ineligibility for anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation [^1149JjHd]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Although anticoagulation therapy markedly reduces the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, up to 50% of these patients are deemed ineligible for anticoagulation. In this manuscript, we provide a framework to assess the net clinical benefit of anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation who have an increased risk of bleeding. We also review recent data related to the novel oral anticoagulants targeting thrombin or factor Xa, and discuss how the introduction of these agents raises the distinction between eligibility for vitamin K antagonist therapy specifically and eligibility for anticoagulation in general.

### Is there a role for warfarin anymore [^116Ympvy]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Reduction of atrial fibrillation-associated stroke risk has become the leading indication for warfarin use. Optimal management of warfarin can only be achieved with a relatively complex infrastructure. Alternative anticoagulant agents have been developed, and three have demonstrated effectiveness, safety, and adherence that are comparable or superior to warfarin in the clinical trial setting. None of the novel agents requires routine laboratory testing to demonstrate effective anticoagulation.

- **Novel agents and their advantages**: These new agents present potential advantages, such as fixed dosing and dramatically reduced intracranial hemorrhaging. However, they are also subject to caveats that ought to be considered in the context of an "ideal" anticoagulant. If used casually, they have the potential to worsen rather than improve health care outcomes.

- **Management burden comparison**: There is little question that the management burden of the novel agents will be less than with warfarin. However, with a hemorrhagic risk that was similar to warfarin in these trials, there will likely remain a significant need for both baseline education and some level of focused interval follow-up to assess for bleeding risk and adherence considerations.

These novel agents offer a definite advance in the available management options for thromboembolic disease. However, until we understand the requirements for safe and effective use in the routine clinical setting, we will not be able to establish the extent to which they should replace warfarin.

### Intravenous thrombolysis in a patient taking warfarin with an international normalised ratio of 1.9 [^114vUTu6]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Intravenous thrombolysis is the mainstay medical treatment for acute ischaemic strokes, but it has strict eligibility criteria. Symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (sICH) is the most adverse complication. A woman aged 76 years presented with signs of an acute stroke. Despite not meeting the eligibility criteria, given her background use of warfarin, she received intravenous thrombolysis with an excellent outcome. This is the first fully documented case report of the contraindicated use of intravenous thrombolysis in a patient presenting with an acute ischaemic stroke on a background of concurrent use of warfarin with an international normalised ratio (INR) as high as 1.9.

It has been perceived that the risk of thrombolysis with a raised INR outweighs the potential benefits. However, documenting its use outside of the eligibility criteria is key to future developments.

### Should aspirin be continued in patients started on warfarin [^117N22WZ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Clinicians frequently face the decision of whether to continue aspirin when starting patients on warfarin. We performed a meta-analysis to characterize the trade-offs involved in this common clinical dilemma.

- **Data sources**: Multiple computerized databases (1966 to 2003), reference lists of relevant articles, conference proceedings, and queries of primary authors.

- **Study selection**: Randomized trials comparing warfarin plus aspirin versus warfarin alone were considered. Studies with target international normalized ratios (INRs) less than 2 were excluded.

- **Data extraction**: Two reviewers independently extracted baseline data and major outcomes: rates of thromboembolism, hemorrhage, and all-cause mortality.

- **Data synthesis**: Nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Of the five that enrolled patients with mechanical heart valves, four used the same target INR in both groups, while one used a reduced target INR for the warfarin plus aspirin group. Pooling the results of the first four studies demonstrated that the combination of warfarin plus aspirin significantly decreased thromboembolic events (relative risk [RR], 0.33; 95% confidence interval, 0.19 to 0.58), increased major bleeding (RR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.44), and decreased all-cause mortality (RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.81) compared to warfarin alone. The one valve trial using a reduced INR in the warfarin plus aspirin group reported no difference in thromboembolic outcomes but found decreased major bleeding and a significant mortality benefit with combination therapy. Of the remaining trials, three evaluated a warfarin.

### Anticoagulant-associated gastrointestinal bleeding: Framework for decisions about whether, when and how to resume anticoagulants [^117EJMk9]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is the most frequent single site of oral anticoagulant (OAC)-associated major bleeding. Patients with major GI bleeding experience morbidity and a substantial risk of short-term all-cause mortality up to 10%. While OACs are frequently discontinued during acute bleeding, there is substantial uncertainty about whether, when, and how OACs should be resumed after bleeding has resolved. Limited evidence suggests a lower risk of thromboembolism and death, and a higher risk of rebleeding with OAC resumption. However, the absolute risks and optimal timing of anticoagulation remain uncertain based on these observational studies at risk of bias, particularly due to baseline confounding.

In addition to an individualized approach to determining the benefits and harms of treatment decisions informed by the best available evidence about thrombosis and rebleeding, discussions should meaningfully incorporate patient values and preferences. The objective of this review is to provide a framework for decision-making by summarizing the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of OAC-associated GI bleeding, providing an approach for assessment and risk stratification for OAC resumption and its timing, and outlining strategies for the prevention of re-GI bleeding.

### European consensus-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of Kawasaki disease - the SHARE initiative [^111L1X2G]. Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for Kawasaki disease, specifically in relation to thromboprophylaxis, the SHARE initiative 2019 guidelines recommend initiating warfarin, in addition to aspirin, following initial heparinization in patients with giant aneurysms (internal diameter ≥ 8 mm, or Z-score ≥ 10, and/or coronary artery stenosis). It is advised to consider discontinuing heparin when a stable INR of 2–3 is achieved.

### Re-initiation of dabigatran and direct factor Xa antagonists following a major bleed [^11131XKx]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are a relatively recent addition to the oral anticoagulant armamentarium and provide an alternative to the use of vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin. Regardless of the type of agent used, bleeding is the major complication of anticoagulant therapy. The decision to restart oral anticoagulation following a major hemorrhage in a previously anticoagulated patient is supported largely by retrospective studies rather than randomized clinical trials (mostly with vitamin K antagonists) and remains an issue of individualized clinical assessment. The patient's risk of thromboembolism must be balanced with the risk of major bleeding. This review provides guidance for clinicians regarding if and when a patient should be re-initiated on DOAC therapy following a major hemorrhage, based on the existing evidence.

### Optimal loading dose of warfarin for the initiation of oral anticoagulation [^112P542H]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). High credibility.

Warfarin is used as an oral anticoagulant; however, there is wide variation in patient response to the warfarin dose. This variation, along with the necessity of maintaining a narrow therapeutic range, makes the selection of the correct warfarin dose at the outset of treatment challenging.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of different initiation doses of warfarin in terms of time in range, time to INR in range, and their effect on serious adverse events.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, DARE, and the NHS Health Economics database on The Cochrane Library (2012, Issue 4); MEDLINE (1950 to April 2012); and EMBASE (1974 to April 2012).

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled trials comparing different initiation regimens of warfarin were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. Authors also evaluated the risk of bias and extracted data from the included studies.

- **Main results**: We identified 12 studies of patients commencing warfarin for inclusion in the review. The overall risk of bias was found to be variable, with most studies reporting adequate methods for randomization, but only two studies provided adequate data on allocation concealment. Four studies (355 patients) compared 5 mg versus 10 mg loading doses. All four studies reported INR in range by day five. Despite notable heterogeneity, pooling these four studies showed no overall difference between 5 mg versus 10 mg loading doses (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.77, P = 0.46, I(2) = 83%). Two of these studies used two consecutive eningen.

### Long-term anticoagulation: The prospects for alternatives to warfarin [^115SP2aA]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Many advances have occurred in the pharmacological treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) since the vitamin K antagonists (e.g. warfarin) and unfractionated heparin were introduced over 60 years ago, but warfarin and other coumarin derivatives remain the only orally administered anticoagulants available for long-term prevention and treatment of VTE. The coumarin derivatives are not convenient to use, as they have a narrow therapeutic index and require frequent laboratory monitoring and dosage adjustment.

The low-molecular-weight heparins, and the indirect factor Xa inhibitor, fondaparinux, offer improvements, but both agents still need to be administered subcutaneously. A number of new, orally available, direct inhibitors of factor Xa or thrombin are in development and offer ease of use and predictability of dosing so that monitoring is not required. These agents hold great promise as new anticoagulants that might provide greater efficacy and safety, and because of these attributes, might lead to greater use of anticoagulant therapy for patients not currently treated.

### New oral anticoagulants: Which one should my patient use [^113GEt11]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

The new oral anticoagulants are rapidly replacing warfarin for several indications. In contrast to warfarin, which lowers the functional levels of all vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, the new agents target either factor Xa or thrombin. With targeted inhibition of coagulation, the new oral anticoagulants have pharmacologic and clinical features that distinguish them from warfarin.

- **Comparison of pharmacology**: This paper compares the pharmacology of the new oral anticoagulants with that of warfarin.
- **Class effects and differentiating features**: It identifies the class effects of these drugs and their differentiating features.
- **Review of indications**: The paper reviews their indications.
- **Clinical decision-making**: This information is used to help clinicians make informed decisions regarding the choice of the right anticoagulant for the right patient.

### The 2018 European Heart Rhythm Association practical guide on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112FikNY]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The manuscript represents the second update of the original Practical Guide, first published in 2013 [Heidbuchel et al. European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of new oral anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2013;15:625–651; Heidbuchel et al. Updated European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2015;17:1467–1507]. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are an alternative to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and have emerged as the preferred choice, especially for patients newly starting on anticoagulation. Both physicians and patients are increasingly accustomed to using these drugs in clinical practice. However, many unresolved questions remain on how to optimally use these agents in specific clinical scenarios.

The European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) aimed to create a unified method to inform physicians about the use of different NOACs. A writing group identified 20 topics of concrete clinical scenarios for which practical answers were formulated, based on available evidence. The 20 topics are as follows:

- **Eligibility for NOACs**
- **Practical start-up and follow-up scheme for patients on NOACs**
- **Ensuring adherence to prescribed oral anticoagulant intake**
- **Switching between anticoagulant regimens**
- **Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions of NOACs**
- **NOACs in patients with chronic kidney or advanced kidney disease**:

The completeness of the list is critical for clinical applications. Further guidance on each topic continues in the document.

### A clinical decision aid for the selection of antithrombotic therapy for the prevention of stroke due to atrial fibrillation [^1146Z8JQ]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

This decision aid is intended to complement, not replace, clinical judgment. It does not yet account for absolute or relative contraindications to therapies such as allergies or intolerances, advanced age, low body weight, or the presence of stage IV or V chronic kidney disease. Additionally, it does not consider conditions that may affect the choice of antithrombotic therapy, such as recent percutaneous coronary intervention, rheumatic fever, or artificial heart valves.

The cost-benefit analyses performed by this decision aid are relatively modest. A more comprehensive model is available; however, considering the pricing dichotomy between ASA/warfarin and new OAC agents, detailed models may not substantially alter results. To accurately reflect the true costs of new OAC agents compared to warfarin or no treatment, one must consider the substantial costs of anticoagulation management and medical care associated with strokes or major bleeding events.

The trials of new OACs were similar in design, patient population, definitions of stroke and major bleeding, and statistical analysis, allowing for cross-study comparisons. The ROCKET-AF trial was an exception, as its patient population had a higher absolute risk of stroke, with a mean CHADS2 score of 3.5 compared to 2.0–2.2 in other trials. Nevertheless, using relative risks rather than absolute risks mitigated this discrepancy.

### Guideline on the management of bleeding in patients on antithrombotic agents [^117612rR]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for bleeding in patients on antithrombotics, more specifically with respect to patients on warfarin, BSH 2013 guidelines recommend administering vitamin K (1–3 mg IV, for one dose) in patients with non-major bleeding while on warfarin.

### Atrial fibrillation and stroke prevention [^114DgmZf]. The Lancet. Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly due to stroke and thromboembolism. Anticoagulant therapy reduces the risk of stroke, and the greatest benefit is seen in patients at the highest absolute risk. Aspirin is a less effective alternative, and any benefit of aspirin might be due to its favorable effects on arterial thrombosis caused by vascular disease. However, anticoagulant therapy remains underused, particularly in the elderly, who probably have the most to gain from stroke prevention owing to their high absolute risk.

The underuse of anticoagulation might also be related to uncertain risk of thromboembolism in individual patients and a perceived overestimation of the benefit and underestimation of risk of bleeding with warfarin in clinical trials. In this review, we summarize the data for and against warfarin and aspirin therapies and discuss the clinical assessments and risk stratifications that guide the use of antithrombotic therapy for stroke prevention in patients with AF. Possible barriers to the uptake of anticoagulation therapy are also discussed.

### Short-term risk of bleeding during heparin bridging at initiation of vitamin K antagonist therapy in more than 90,000 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation managed in outpatient care [^112FM2o4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), a treatable risk factor for ischemic stroke, is considered a worldwide epidemic that is predicted to increase in the coming decades. In 2010, the estimated global prevalence of atrial fibrillation was 33.5 million. Oral anticoagulation is the cornerstone treatment for NVAF patients with a moderate or high risk of thromboembolic complication.

Although direct oral anticoagulants, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, have been available since 2010, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), including warfarin, acenocoumarol, and fluindione, remain standard treatments in the management of NVAF.

Recently, several studies have examined the risks of bleeding as well as ischemic stroke and systemic embolism (IS/SE) associated with perioperative heparin bridging anticoagulation in patients with NVAF. However, no studies have investigated bridging risks during VKA initiation in outpatient settings. It has been shown that the bleeding risk is highest during the first month of VKA initiation. This risk may be greatest when a VKA is combined with another antithrombotic agent, particularly in patients for whom bridging therapy is indicated. Bridging therapy at the initiation of VKA therapy consists of transitioning a bridging agent, such as low‐molecular‐weight heparin (LMWH) or other pentasaccharide like fondaparinux and unfractionated heparin, to a VKA.

There is an overall consensus in favor of a bridging therapy prior to urgent cardioversion in patients with life‐threatening hemodynamic instability caused by new‐onset NVAF.

### Anticoagulation in chronic kidney disease: from guidelines to clinical practice [^113o3VsT]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Consequently, the initiation of anticoagulation therapy in severe CKD and ESRD is still a debated topic. Practitioners are confused by the information based on observational studies with irregular designs or inaccurate administrative registries, leading to extremely variable results. Systematic analyses and meta-analyses can no longer provide accurate data, even when conducting sophisticated data analysis. Uncertainty is even higher in VTE, for which there are no guideline recommendations. Another problem is that of OACs for primary prevention of thromboembolic events in AF, particularly in stage 5 and dialysis patients.

Cardiologists tend to extrapolate guideline recommendations to patients without CKD, while nephrologists are reticent in this respect. The latest 2011 KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines state that only nephrologists should recommend OACs as primary prevention in ESRD and dialysis patients, based on a strictly individualized algorithm. A prudent approach to secondary prevention is to administer OAC to all ESRD patients without absolute contraindications. The use of DOACs is nonstandardized and possible in low apixaban/rivaroxaban doses in patients with ESRD at very high risk of ischemic stroke and with warfarin intolerance or suboptimal TTR, or in patients with recurrent stroke on adequate warfarin treatment.

There are several ongoing trials comparing DOACs and warfarin in AF and CKD stages 4 and 5, as well as randomized studies focusing on the safety of OACs in patients with AF and dialysis.

### Coumadin [^116Z36Ej]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

- **Individualized dosing**: The dosage and administration of Coumadin must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's INR response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated [see References (15)]. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) to assist in the determination of the duration and intensity of anticoagulation with Coumadin.

- **Recommended target INR ranges and durations for individual indications**: An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

	- **Venous thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)**: Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0–3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

		- For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
		- For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
		- For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment for the individual patient.

### Concomitant antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy: indications, controversies and practical advice [^117J83e5]. Thrombosis Research (2008). Low credibility.

Use of combination antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy is commonly encountered in clinical practice and often generates clinical controversy regarding the efficacy versus the safety of this regimen. The benefit of combination therapy relates to the probable additive effect of suppressing both platelet and coagulation factor activities. The risk of dual therapy is the potential for increased hemorrhagic events, which may outweigh the clinical benefit. This review focuses on the clinical evidence that has demonstrated greater efficacy with combination therapy over either antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy alone. Clinicians should consider the importance of documenting combination therapy use in their patients to target those who would gain the most benefit and avoid unnecessary complications.

### New oral anticoagulants vs. warfarin treatment: No need for pharmacogenomics [^1111SqC1]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

For patients requiring long-term anticoagulation, oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin demonstrate overwhelming efficacy data yet present significant challenges. In addition to the potential exposure to numerous drug-drug and drug-food interactions, patients receiving warfarin require frequent monitoring. It was hoped that integrating pharmacogenomics with clinical information would improve anticoagulation control with warfarin, but trials have not supported this aim. Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) offer both advantages and disadvantages and deserve consideration in appropriate patients.

### Safety and efficacy of starting warfarin after two consecutive platelet count rises in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^111UPpwh]. Thrombosis Research (2016). Low credibility.

Guidelines on the treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) recommend initiating warfarin when platelet levels recover to 150×10(9)/L or more. However, many patients may not achieve this platelet level or may experience slow platelet recovery. This study aims to determine if initiating warfarin when platelets start trending upward, instead of at a specific level, is safe and effective in patients diagnosed with HIT.

- **Materials and methods**: Two groups of patients diagnosed and treated for HIT in a tertiary care hospital were assessed for HIT-related outcomes. Twenty-eight patients had warfarin initiated after platelets recovered to 150×10(9)/L or more, and 30 patients had warfarin initiated prior to platelet recovery.

- **Results**: There was no significant difference in the rates of thrombosis, venous limb gangrene, or limb amputation. Three patients died during the data collection period, all deemed unrelated to HIT by independent investigators. The average hospital length of stay was 22.2 ± 12.7 days for patients who started warfarin at platelet counts less than 150×10(9)/L and 38.8 ± 19.1 days for those who started at counts greater than or equal to 150×10(9)/L (P = 0.0002).

- **Conclusions**: The data suggests that the absolute platelet level at which warfarin is initiated does not affect the rate of thrombosis or mortality but may shorten overall hospital length of stay and associated costs. Observing an upward trend in platelets rather than achieving an absolute platelet level before starting warfarin in patients with HIT may be more beneficial.

### Effectiveness and safety of vitamin K antagonists and new anticoagulants in the prevention of thromboembolism in atrial fibrillation in older adults - a systematic review of reviews and the development of recommendations to reduce inappropriate prescribing [^111vb5Xk]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). High credibility.

This systematic review (SR) is part of a series focused on the efficacy and safety of commonly prescribed drugs in older adults. An efficient method, based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, was used and has been published in detail. Briefly, a four-stage approach was employed:

- **Search 1 and 2**: Systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) from a database search were retrieved.

- **Search 3A**: Individual studies not included in SRs were retrieved.

- **Search 3B**: Individual studies from a database search were retrieved.

Each search continued only if the research team determined that the collected evidence was insufficient or lacked the quality necessary for evidence-based recommendations. A study protocol for this SR is available upon request from the authors.

Searches 1 and 2 were conducted on October 5, 2015, with an update on December 12, 2016, by trained researchers at the University of Manchester. These searches included the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA), with no limitations on study publication dates. The evidence gathered was deemed of sufficient quality, negating the need for searches 3A or 3B for individual studies. A comprehensive search with existing terms was performed on February 2, 2017, to ensure thorough coverage.

### Coumadin [^115L7BCd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

- **Initial and maintenance dosing**: The appropriate initial dosing of Coumadin varies widely for different patients. Not all factors responsible for warfarin dose variability are known, and the initial dose is influenced by clinical factors such as age, race, body weight, sex, concomitant medications, and comorbidities. Genetic factors, including CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes, also play a role [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].

	- Select the initial dose based on the expected maintenance dose, taking into account the above factors. Modify this dose based on patient-specific clinical factors. Consider lower initial and maintenance doses for elderly and/or debilitated patients and in Asian patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Routine use of loading doses is not recommended as this practice may increase hemorrhagic and other complications and does not offer more rapid protection against clot formation.

	- Individualize the duration of therapy for each patient. In general, anticoagulant therapy should be continued until the danger of thrombosis and embolism has passed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

- **Dosing recommendations without consideration of genotype**: If the patient's CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes are not known, the initial dose of Coumadin is usually 2 to 5 mg once daily. Determine each patient's dosing needs by close monitoring of the INR response and consideration of the indication being treated. Typical maintenance doses are 2 to 10 mg once daily.

### Guideline on the management of bleeding in patients on antithrombotic agents [^117RwLmW]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for bleeding in patients on antithrombotics, more specifically with respect to warfarin reversal before surgery, BSH 2013 guidelines recommend avoiding the use of prothrombin complex concentrate to enable elective or non-urgent surgery.
