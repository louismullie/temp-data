## Question

Positive calcium score

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret a positive coronary artery calcium (CAC) score and translate it into management decisions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what constitutes a "positive" CAC and how to quantify it. Then, I should verify the prognostic implications across score ranges. Next, I will integrate CAC with conventional risk factors and guideline thresholds. After that, I need to outline treatment decisions by score category, including statins, aspirin, and LDL-C targets. Finally, I should consider special populations, repeat testing intervals, and limitations, and close with a concise clinical takeaway anchored in shared decision-making.

> Let me first confirm the definition and quantification. A positive CAC score is any Agatston score greater than 0, indicating the presence of calcified coronary atherosclerosis; scores are typically categorized as 1–99, 100–299, 300–999, and ≥ 1000, with higher scores reflecting greater atherosclerotic burden and higher event risk [^e4d30c94] [^cd939861].

> Wait, let me verify the prognostic gradient. I initially thought a CAC ≥ 100 corresponded to a 10-year ASCVD risk around 10%, but hold on, I should double-check the data. In MESA, CAC ≥ 100 is associated with a 10-year hard ASCVD event rate greater than 7.5%, and CAC ≥ 300 with rates consistently above 15%, with even higher rates in older adults; in CONFIRM, CAC > 300 carried event rates comparable to patients with established ASCVD, supporting secondary-prevention–like intensity in those with very high CAC [^cd939861] [^ba2cb6fb].

> I need to ensure I integrate CAC with baseline risk. CAC adds independent prognostic value beyond traditional risk factors and improves discrimination and reclassification, particularly in borderline and intermediate risk patients; however, I should confirm that CAC is not recommended for very low or very high baseline risk, where it rarely changes management and may add little value [^6e40372c] [^132abb46].

> Next, I should review management by score category. For CAC 1–99, I should confirm that even low-level calcification increases risk compared with CAC 0, and that age modifies the threshold to treat; in adults ≥ 55 years, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy, whereas in younger patients with CAC 1–99, I should consider lifetime risk and patient preference in shared decision-making [^42a48cac] [^f090894c]. For CAC ≥ 100 or ≥ 75th percentile, I should confirm that statin therapy is generally recommended given the > 7.5% 10-year risk threshold, and I should also consider aspirin if bleeding risk is acceptable and ASCVD risk is ≥ 5% [^f090894c] [^22771da1]. For CAC ≥ 300, I need to ensure more aggressive LDL-C lowering is pursued, often to < 70 mg/dL and sometimes < 55 mg/dL depending on overall risk, given risk equivalence to secondary prevention populations [^ba2cb6fb] [^401b5e5c].

> Hold on, I should verify the approach to CAC 0. CAC = 0 confers very low near-term risk and is the strongest negative risk marker; in adults 40–75 without diabetes, smoking, or premature ASCVD family history, it is reasonable to defer statins and reassess in 5–10 years, but I must not downclassify patients with high-risk features such as diabetes, active smoking, or familial hypercholesterolemia, where CAC 0 does not negate long-term risk and evidence-based LDL-C lowering remains indicated [^9c231a95] [^d612b1ae] [^19461b6c].

> I will now examine special populations. In diabetes, CAC powerfully stratifies risk; even a CAC < 10 substantially lowers event risk, but I should confirm that CAC = 0 does not eliminate the need for statins in diabetes, though it may temper intensity in select cases through shared decision-making [^cb1f0075]. In severe primary hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL), CAC helps identify those at highest near-term risk; CAC > 0 supports aggressive LDL-C lowering, whereas CAC = 0 does not obviate the need for long-term therapy given lifetime risk [^efeaf478] [^19461b6c]. In older adults, CAC is common and may be less informative for short-term decisions; selective use can still refine risk, but I should avoid overtesting when results won't change management [^562bd1d0] [^d94edda3].

> Let me consider repeat testing intervals. I should confirm that CAC progression of about 20–25% per year is typical, and that repeat CAC can be considered at 3–5 years if results would change therapy; for CAC = 0, repeating at 5–7 years in low risk, 3–5 years in borderline to intermediate risk, and about 3 years in high risk or diabetes is reasonable, while for CAC ≥ 100, repeating at 3 years can help detect accelerated progression that may warrant intensification [^4274d35b] [^3fb95f01].

> But wait, what about limitations and pitfalls. CAC detects calcified plaque and may miss noncalcified vulnerable plaque, so a positive CAC confirms atherosclerosis, whereas a CAC of 0 does not absolutely exclude it; this is particularly relevant in younger patients and women, where noncalcified disease is more prevalent, and in symptomatic patients, where CAC should be interpreted in clinical context and may serve as a gatekeeper to further testing rather than a stand-alone diagnostic tool [^5db0ee77] [^97a8b5fc]. I should also remember that statins can modestly increase CAC over time, so progression alone is not a treatment failure and should be interpreted alongside clinical risk and LDL-C response [^4274d35b].

> Next, I should review how to communicate risk. I need to ensure I provide both absolute risk estimates from the CAC score and relative risk context using age–sex–race percentiles, because absolute risk guides near-term treatment decisions while percentiles inform lifetime risk trajectory and patient motivation; this framing improves shared decision-making and aligns with guideline emphasis on clinician–patient risk discussion [^03b9ee21] [^d547f6e8].

> Final clinical takeaway: a positive CAC score signals subclinical atherosclerosis and should trigger risk-aligned prevention. CAC 1–99 supports moderate-intensity statins in older adults and individualized decisions in younger patients; CAC ≥ 100 or ≥ 75th percentile supports statin therapy and consideration of aspirin if bleeding risk is acceptable; CAC ≥ 300 warrants aggressive LDL-C lowering and secondary-prevention–like intensity; CAC = 0 allows deferral of statins in appropriately selected low-risk adults but not in those with diabetes, smoking, or familial hypercholesterolemia, and all decisions should be anchored in shared decision-making and periodic reassessment of risk [^f090894c] [^22771da1] [^ba2cb6fb] [^9c231a95] [^6e40372c].

A positive calcium score means **coronary artery calcium is present**, indicating atherosclerotic plaque and higher cardiovascular risk [^e15761ac]. The higher the score, the greater the risk of heart attacks and events [^cd939861]. CAC scoring is most useful in **borderline or intermediate-risk adults** (5–20% 10-year ASCVD risk) to refine risk and guide statin decisions [^6e40372c] [^035a424d]. It is not recommended for very low- or high-risk patients, as results rarely change management [^132abb46]. Management should be individualized: consider statins for CAC ≥ 100 or ≥ 75th percentile, and use shared decision-making for CAC 1–99 or CAC = 0 with risk enhancers [^f090894c] [^d612b1ae].

---

## Clinical significance of a positive calcium score

- **Presence of atherosclerosis**: A positive CAC score indicates calcified coronary plaque, reflecting subclinical atherosclerosis and higher ASCVD risk [^e15761ac] [^3909a39c].

- **Graded risk**: Risk rises continuously with higher CAC scores; CAC ≥ 100 confers > 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk, and CAC ≥ 300 is associated with markedly higher event rates [^cd939861] [^401b5e5c].

- **Event prediction**: CAC independently predicts MI, CHD death, and all-cause mortality, improving risk discrimination beyond traditional risk factors [^bb1fd497] [^fc024b9f].

---

## Risk stratification and clinical decision-making

CAC scoring is most impactful in **borderline (5– < 7.5%) or intermediate (7.5– < 20%) 10-year ASCVD risk** adults, helping refine risk and guide statin use [^6e40372c] [^035a424d]. It is not recommended for very low-risk (< 5%) or high-risk (≥ 20%) patients, where results rarely alter management [^132abb46] [^035a424d].

| **Calcium score** | **Clinical interpretation** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|-|
| 0 | Very low risk; excellent prognosis | - Defer statins unless diabetes, smoking, or family history <br/> - Repeat CAC in 3–5 years if risk enhancers present [^9c231a95] [^3fb95f01] |
| 1–99 | Mild atherosclerosis; modestly increased risk | - Consider statins if ≥ 55 years or ≥ 75th percentile <br/> - Shared decision-making [^f090894c] [^23a6256f] |
| 100–299 | Moderate atherosclerosis; significant risk | Initiate statins; consider aspirin if low bleeding risk [^f090894c] [^22771da1] |
| ≥ 300 | Extensive atherosclerosis; high risk | - High-intensity statins <br/> - Consider aspirin <br/> - Consider additional LDL-lowering therapies [^f090894c] [^4a3e63e7] |

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Noncalcified plaque**: CAC may miss noncalcified plaques, so a zero score does not exclude obstructive CAD, especially in younger patients or women [^5db0ee77] [^f4b78e3f].

- **Radiation exposure**: Low-dose CT is used, but cumulative exposure should be considered, particularly with repeat testing [^d612b1ae].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, sex, and risk enhancers (e.g. diabetes, family history) should guide interpretation and management [^03b9ee21] [^3e9a456d].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **ACC/AHA 2019**: CAC is reasonable in borderline/intermediate-risk adults to inform statin decisions via shared decision-making [^6e40372c] [^23a6256f].

- **NLA 2020**: CAC refines risk and guides therapy; CAC ≥ 100 supports statins, and CAC ≥ 300 supports intensive LDL-C lowering [^401b5e5c] [^65da41a9].

- **AHA/ACC 2018**: CAC can be used selectively to refine risk and guide statin therapy in primary prevention [^f090894c] [^a5a0ba03].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Repeat CAC can be considered to assess progression; typical intervals are 3–5 years, with shorter intervals for higher baseline scores or risk enhancers [^3fb95f01] [^760c9d28]. Progression > 20–25% per year or new CAC ≥ 300 suggests accelerated atherosclerosis and may warrant intensified therapy [^4274d35b] [^3fb95f01].

---

A positive calcium score reflects calcified coronary plaque and higher ASCVD risk; use CAC to refine risk and guide prevention, especially in borderline or intermediate-risk adults, while integrating patient factors and shared decision-making.

Conclusions

The Clinical Research Roundtable at the Institute of Medicine has identified translation of clinical research findings into improvements in medical care as the "next scientific frontier". While our analysis has some limitations, it provides methodology that will directly assist in the translation of research into practice. Our models, once validated, can be used directly by patients and clinicians to decide when it might be useful to order this potentially expensive test, and what to do with the results.

### Is there a role for coronary artery calcium scoring for management of asymptomatic patients at risk for coronary artery disease?: clinical risk scores are not sufficient to define primary prevention treatment strategies among asymptomatic patients [^9b5684a8]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Although risk factors have proven to be useful therapeutic targets, they are poor predictors of risk. Traditional risk scores are moderately successful in predicting future CHD events and can be a starting place for general risk categorization. However, there is substantial heterogeneity between traditional risk and actual atherosclerosis burden, with event rates predominantly driven by burden of atherosclerosis. Serum biomarkers have yet to show any clinically significant incremental value to the FRS and even when combined cannot match the predictive value of atherosclerosis imaging. As clinicians, are we willing to base therapy decisions on risk models that lack optimum-achievable accuracy and limit personalization? The decision to treat a patient in primary prevention must be a careful one because the benefit of therapy in an asymptomatic patient must clearly outweigh the potential risk. CAC, in particular, provides a personalized assessment of risk and may identify patients who will be expected to derive the most, and the least, net absolute benefit from treatment. Emerging evidence hints that CAC may also promote long-term adherence to aspirin, exercise, diet, and statin therapy. When potentially lifelong treatment decisions are on the line, clinicians must arm their patients with the most accurate risk prediction tools, and subclinical atherosclerosis testing with CAC is, at the present time, superior to any combination of risk factors and serum biomarkers.

### The potential and pitfalls of coronary artery calcium scoring (...) [^e15761ac]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Among asymptomatic middle-aged to older adults, one of the most sensitive, reliable, and reproducible ways of noninvasively identifying subclinical atherosclerosis is coronary artery calcium testing. Numerous studies have demonstrated the robust association between presence and severity of CAC and future risk of cardiovascular disease. 1, 2 Conversely, the absence of CAC has been associated with low rates of CVD. 3, 4 Based on the available evidence of the role of CAC in improving the estimation of CVD risk. , multisociety practice guidelines from the United States, Europe, and others endorse the selective use of CAC in adults aged 40 to 75 years with borderline or intermediate estimated 10-year atherosclerotic CVD risk to guide the intensification of preventive strategies.

5, 6 When CAC is absent, current American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines recommend that clinicians consider providing no statin to some patients who are not at an elevated risk on the basis of smoking status, family history, and diabetes. Beyond this recommendation, however, some investigators have called for broader de-risking of patients with a CAC score of 0, suggesting that even those with familial hypercholesterolemia and a CAC score of 0 may not need add-on therapy beyond statins and ezetimibe. 7 The article by Mortensen et al8 in this issue of JAMA Cardiology should give pause to efforts to broaden the use of a CAC score of 0 to de-escalate or defer statin therapy in all individuals.

### Coronary calcium score and cardiovascular risk [^52350b18]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a highly specific feature of coronary atherosclerosis. On the basis of single-center and multicenter clinical and population-based studies with short-term and long-term outcomes data (up to 15-year follow-up), CAC scoring has emerged as a widely available, consistent, and reproducible means of assessing risk for major cardiovascular outcomes, especially useful in asymptomatic people for planning primary prevention interventions such as statins and aspirin. CAC testing in asymptomatic populations is cost effective across a broad range of baseline risk. This review summarizes evidence concerning CAC, including its pathobiology, modalities for detection, predictive role, use in prediction scoring algorithms, CAC progression, evidence that CAC changes the clinical approach to the patient and patient behavior, novel applications of CAC, future directions in scoring CAC scans, and new CAC guidelines.

### Interpreting the coronary artery calcium score-critical information for the practicing physician [^e4d30c94]. The American Journal of Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery calcium scanning is a routine test for assessing the severity of atherosclerosis in asymptomatic individuals. This inexpensive, noninvasive test quantifies the calcium deposition in the 4 principal coronary arteries. Correct interpretation is important to the physician (for recommending therapy) and to the patient (for determining his or her lifetime risk of a cardiovascular event). A score of 0 indicates that a cardiovascular event is extremely unlikely in the next 5 years. In contrast, a score greater than 0 portends a coronary event. The higher the score, the greater the risk. Both the arterial location of the calcium and the number of coronary arteries involved alter the interpretation of the calcium score. At any given age, females have significantly lower scores than males. One-third of individuals with scores greater than 1000 will have a cardiovascular event within 3 years. For all elevated calcium scores, aggressive treatment is warranted, including significant lifestyle changes and medications to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Understanding the importance of the coronary artery calcium score will result in improved therapy and patient compliance.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) future research directions emphasize that CAC-guided care leading to improved population health requires interventions that produce improved patient-centered outcomes via initiation of effective preventive strategies with established risk reduction; high-quality evidence is increasingly required to guide medical necessity and coverage decisions, current evidence suggests CAC-guided improved adherence to therapies and healthy behaviors, and recognition of CAC in primary prevention should increase given PCE limitations.

In conclusion, routine evaluation of CACS before coronary CTA may be advised as it significantly increases the diagnostic accuracy to identify patients in whom further testing will be needed following coronary CTA. Deferral of these patients to other diagnostic modalities might be beneficial as coronary CTA does not lead to a final decision regarding CAD management.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) prognostic evidence in asymptomatic individuals—the review notes that since 2010 a synthesis of evidence reveals further validation of the prognostic utility of CAC in asymptomatic individuals; across 7 registries, the cumulative sample size is 84,182 with outcomes including all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, unstable angina hospitalization, late revascularization ≥3 months after scanning, and composite MACE; reported associations include relative risk ratios as high as 20 times greater for high risk CAC scores compared with a CAC score of 0; follow-up has been extended with mortality data beyond 10 years after CAC scanning, and analyses compare event risk among those with 0 CAC versus detectable CAC.

### Calcium scoring for cardiovascular computed tomography: how, when and why? [^9a83883f]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide. Despite major advances in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, enhanced prevention of ischemic heart disease remains critical to improving the health of individuals and communities. The computed tomographic coronary artery calcium score is an established imaging biomarker that identifies the presence and amount of coronary atherosclerosis in an individual and their future risk for clinical cardiovascular disease and premature cardiovascular death. This article describes the process of performing a computed tomography scan for coronary artery calcium, quantifying the score and interpreting the results.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) prognostic significance—key uncertainties include intermediate scores and follow-up for score zero: the guideline makes use of available data to predict the risk associated with CAC but states these data need to be amplified by new and ongoing studies to guide treatment decisions; it notes that particular uncertainty exists about the predictive value of intermediate CAC scores; and it adds that the predictive significance of a CAC score of zero must be further verified in follow-up studies and that for patients with a CAC score of zero it is currently uncertain when and if follow-up CAC measurements should be done to reassess risk status.

### What is the role of calcium scoring in the age of coronary computed tomographic angiography? [^97a8b5fc]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Non-contrast-enhanced CT for coronary artery calcification (CAC) as a marker of coronary atherosclerosis has been studied extensively in the primary prevention setting. With rapidly evolving multidetector CT technology, contrast-enhanced coronary CT angiography (CCTA) has emerged as the non-invasive method of choice for detailed imaging of the coronary tree. In this review, we systematically evaluate the role of CAC testing in the age of CCTA in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients, across varying levels of risk. Although the role of CAC testing is well established in asymptomatic subjects, its use in evaluating those with stable symptoms that represent possible obstructive coronary artery disease is controversial. Nevertheless, available data suggest that in low-to-intermediate risk symptomatic patients, CAC scanning may serve as an appropriate gatekeeper to further testing with either CCTA (if no or only mild CAC present) versus functional imaging or invasive coronary angiography (when moderate or severe CAC present). Given the strong short-term prognostic value of CAC = 0, studies are needed to further evaluate the role of CAC scanning in low-risk patients with acute chest pain presenting to the emergency room.

Lower-risk adults—statin value and CAC testing: Benefit from statin therapy is also seen in lower-risk individuals, and for those in the 5% to <7.5% risk range, available generic statins are cost-effective; although a coronary artery calcium score can be useful in select individuals, it will be positive less often in this lower-risk group than in those with higher levels of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk and is not recommended routinely.

### CT-based calcium scoring to screen for coronary artery disease: why arent't we there yet? [^9daf013f]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to examine the value of coronary artery calcium scoring as a screening tool for identifying individuals at risk of experiencing a catastrophic coronary event.

Conclusion

Because of the noninvasive nature of CT and the large societal burden of coronary atherosclerosis, there is great interest in developing CT-based techniques for detection of coronary artery calcium, a known marker of underlying atherosclerosis. However, important questions remain including the role of calcium in the process of acute plaque rupture, the utility of this technique in the asymptomatic population, and the statistical distribution of calcium scores and hard cardiac events in the general population.

Expert opinion treatment recommendations—these sections propose treatment guidance based on expert opinion; the treatment recommendations are not based on randomized clinical trial evidence but have been extrapolated from retrospective analyses and non-randomized prospective evaluations, and they respond to frequent requests within the clinical community from generalists and cardiologists to guide treatment based on CAC findings.

### Clinical indications for coronary artery calcium scoring in asymptomatic patients: expert consensus statement from the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography [^a3b28486]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2017). Medium credibility.

Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography expert consensus on coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring in asymptomatic patients summarizes the prognostic value of CAC and its ability to refine individual risk prediction, addresses limitations of traditional risk factor-based treatment strategies recommended by the 2013 ACC/AHA Prevention guidelines including the Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) and the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) Recommendation Statement for Statin Use for the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in Adults. It provides CAC based treatment recommendations both within the context of the shared decision making model espoused by the 2013 ACC/AHA Prevention guidelines and independent of these guidelines. Unlike global risk scores such as the Framingham Risk Score or the Pooled Cohort Equation (PCE), the CAC score is a direct marker of atherosclerosis in an individual patient and provides an assessment of the burden of coronary atherosclerosis, reflecting the integrated lifetime effect of all risk factors in an individual patient. The research base is extensive, with peer-reviewed publications exceeding 1250.

### The National Lipid Association scientific statement on coronary artery calcium scoring to guide preventive strategies for ASCVD risk reduction [^478c6fd5]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

CAC = 0—prognosis and negative risk marker: Among patients aged ≥75 years, 16% of 1663 had a calcium score of zero, with a survival rate of 98% at a mean follow up of 5.6 years. In the Biolmage study of adults aged 55–80 years, 86% qualified for statin therapy for primary prevention due to a 10-year ASCVD risk of ≥7.5%, and within this population CAC = 0 as well as CAC<10 were the strongest negative risk factors for development of cardiovascular disease over a median follow-up of 2.7 years. Key points emphasize that CAC = 0 is associated with highly favorable cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular prognosis and is the strongest “negative risk marker” for ASCVD.

### Coronary artery calcium scoring: is It time for a change in methodology? [^4e0e1644]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Quantification of coronary artery calcium (CAC) has been shown to be reliable, reproducible, and predictive of cardiovascular risk. Formal CAC scoring was introduced in 1990, with early scoring algorithms notable for their simplicity and elegance. Yet, with little evidence available on how to best build a score, and without a conceptual model guiding score development, these scores were, to a large degree, arbitrary. In this review, we describe the traditional approaches for clinical CAC scoring, noting their strengths, weaknesses, and limitations. We then discuss a conceptual model for developing an improved CAC score, reviewing the evidence supporting approaches most likely to lead to meaningful score improvement (for example, accounting for CAC density and regional distribution). After discussing the potential implementation of an improved score in clinical practice, we follow with a discussion of the future of CAC scoring, asking the central question: do we really need a new CAC score?

The third and fourth clinical scenarios presented in Table 5, on the other hand, provide examples where the test is unlikely to change management. The 40-year-old woman who smokes, for example, has a very low pre-test 10-year CHD risk (3%). It is very likely her CAC score will be zero (89%) or less than 100 (10%), in which case her post-test 10-year CHD risk will still be low (≤ 5%) and her management would not change. The 80-year-old man with high cholesterol has a high pre-test 10-year CHD risk (26%) and a high probability of having a high CAC score (70% will have a score > 100), in which case his post-test 10-year CHD risk would remain over 20% and his management would have to remain aggressive. In these cases, and others in which the risk factor profile indicates very low or very high pre-test risk, the test is not likely to provide useful results, and the clinician might decide not to order the test. We have provided a simple spreadsheet (see Additional File 1) that may be used by readers of this article to replicate these analyses and apply our models to other clinical scenarios.

While others have proposed similar Bayesian approaches to use of the CAC score for coronary risk prediction [,-], ours has advantages. Previous approaches do generally take into account the pre-test probability of coronary heart disease, but none consider the expected distribution of CAC scores in the tested population after adjustment for conventional CHD risk factors. Raggi et al advocate use of an age- and sex-adjusted calcium score percentile, but this ignores both persons with zero scores and the strong effects of other risk factors such as hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Some approaches use only sensitivity and specificity from dichotomized CAC score cutoffs, and others use CAC score-specific relative risks generated from a single study population. Only two provide actual post-test risk estimates for specific clinical situations. Our approach takes into account the pre-test coronary risk, the expected distribution of CAC scores adjusted for all conventional CHD risk factors, and summary adjusted relative risks from a recent meta-analysis, and provides clinically relevant post-test risk estimates that may be directly useful to primary care physicians, cardiologists and patients as they decide whether or not to take medications for primary prevention of CHD.

Approach to patients with CAC = 0—prognosis and negative risk markers: CAC = 0 is associated with highly favorable prognosis, with studies showing a very low mortality rate of approximately 1–2% over the following 10-years. CAC = 0 is the single strongest negative predictor for developing a cardiovascular event; in MESA it was compared with 12 other negative risk markers, including hsCRP <2 mg/L, and was much more reassuring than all other markers for reducing post-test cardiovascular risk.

ASCVD primary prevention—coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring—In adults at intermediate risk (≥7.5% to <20% 10-year ASCVD risk) or selected adults at borderline risk (5% to <7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) with uncertainty about preventive interventions, it is reasonable to measure a CAC score to guide clinician-patient risk discussion; for these individuals, the assessment of coronary artery calcium is a reasonable tool to reclassify risk either upward or downward, as part of shared decision-making.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores 1–10—compared with CAC 0, risk is higher even at these low scores. One cohort reported 104 deaths in CAC 0 (0.52%) versus 58 deaths in CAC 1–10 (1.06%), with an adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality of 1.99 (95% CI: 1.44 to 2.75). In MESA, of 6809 individuals, 508 had a CAC score of 1–10 and, over a median 4.1 years, there were 28 coronary heart disease events; in a 9715-patient cohort with average 14.6 years follow-up, risk-adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality with CAC 1–10 vs CAC 0 were 1.99 in women and 1.7 in men.

### The National Lipid Association scientific statement on coronary artery calcium scoring to guide preventive strategies for ASCVD risk reduction [^b60911af]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions—clinical utility of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring state that CAC scoring is a widely available, safe, cost-effective, rapidly performed test that improves discrimination of those at risk for ASCVD and serves to better reclassify risk, when used in conjunction with global risk scoring systems, than other clinically available tools, and that its predictive value has been consistently demonstrated in men and women of all studied races and ethnicities. The statement notes that while there have been no large, prospective randomized controlled ASCVD outcomes trials that utilized CAC scores as entry criteria, the evidence base supporting the clinical use of CAC scoring in primary prevention continues to grow and points to its valuable role to aid in the allocation of preventive therapies to those most likely to benefit, and that with the advent of future refinements and increased access based on lower cost and greater insurance coverage, more clinicians will be able to utilize this powerful tool to provide higher quality preventive care for their patients.

### What does my patient's coronary artery calcium score mean? Combining information from the coronary artery calcium score with information from conventional risk factors to estimate coronary heart disease risk [^fdce7338]. BMC Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Aggressive primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) is most appropriate in patients at relatively high risk of CHD events. The coronary artery calcium (CAC) score is an independent predictor of coronary heart disease risk [-], and therefore may help in deciding how aggressively to pursue cholesterol-lowering, anti-platelet therapy and other primary prevention strategies. To use a given CAC score result, however, one must know how that score compares with the score of an average person of the same sex, age and CHD risk factor profile. A CAC score of 50, for example, may be unusually high for a 40-year-old woman without other CHD risk factors, but unusually low for a 70-year-old man with hypertension. The same score, therefore, affects risk assessment in opposite directions for these two patients. How should a clinician use this CAC score (or any other) when assessing the CHD risk of a more typical patient, say a 60-year-old woman with hypertension and high cholesterol?

To answer this question, we need to know the effects of age, sex and other CHD risk factors on the expected distribution of CAC scores. Several large cross-sectional studies have described the prevalence and extent of CAC among different age/sex groups [,-] without accounting for conventional CHD risk factors that may strongly influence predicted CAC scores. Five previous studies examined how CAC relates to conventional CHD risk factors [-]. Only one of these was adequately powered, none adequately accounted for the abnormal distribution of CAC scores, and none yielded estimates usable for clinical decision-making.

We identified a large sample of men and women without clinical CHD who presented for electron beam computed tomography scanning. Using questionnaire data collected from these patients about smoking habits and medical history (hypertension, high cholesterol and diabetes), we determined how conventional CHD risk factors, along with age and sex, affect CAC scores. We then developed a method for combining information from conventional risk factors and the CAC score (easy spreadsheet calculator attached), and we present several examples illustrating how that method may be applied in common clinical situations.

It further states that CAC = 0 is associated with highly favorable cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular prognosis and that CAC = 0 is the strongest “negative risk marker” for ASCVD.

Conclusion

A zero CAC score in patients with stable chest pain reliably excludes obstructive CAD and is associated with an overall very good prognosis. However, CTCA provides further diagnostic and prognostic information, revealing underlying CAD in over 10% of patients. We now know that such patients should be treated with preventive medical therapy to improve their prognosis.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score 0—long-term risk is very low across endpoints, with a summary risk ratio for long-term follow-up of 0.29 (p < 0.0001); for cardiovascular disease endpoints with absent CAC the summary risk ratio was 0.20 (p < 0.0001), and for >10-year all-cause mortality it was 0.36 (p < 0.0001). Among aging individuals with CAC = 0, event rates were 0.407% for CVD and 2.2% for CHD after 10 years, and in MESA 38% of patients with diabetes had a CAC score of 0.

### Coronary artery calcium score as a graded decision tool [^1696dd3f]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Over the last 3 decades, coronary artery calcium (CAC) has emerged as a highly specific marker for coronary atherosclerosis. Agatston et alfirst described noncontrast-enhanced, electrocardiographically gated computed tomography as an effective tool to quantify CAC in 1990 and improve cardiovascular risk assessment. Since then, CAC has been studied extensively in myriad of population-based studies and has been shown to effectively stratify cardiovascular risk across ethnicities, irrespective of age, sex, and risk factor burden.,,Beyond risk stratification, CAC can identify high-risk patient subgroups who are more likely to benefit from more intensive primary prevention strategies. Quantification of CAC, distribution, location, and its association with high-risk plaque have added to our understanding of this innovative and yet simple decision tool.

The 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (AHA)/Multisociety cholesterol guideline recommends the selective use of CAC scoring in primary prevention to aid in the decision-making process regarding statin therapy when there is uncertainty on the part of the clinician or patient.If the CAC score is >100 AU or ≥75th percentile of the CAC score distribution for a particular age/gender, initiating statin therapy is encouraged because of the predicted strong net benefit. However, therapeutic inertia remains an issue in implementing novel preventive strategies in those with high CAC scores but without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events.

### Role of coronary artery calcium testing for risk assessment in primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: a review [^035a424d]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Current guidelines recommend a few different approaches to the use of coronary artery calcium (CAC) testing as a tool for risk assessment and decision-making regarding drug therapy for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

Observations

Coronary artery calcium testing is not recommended for universal screening, particularly in patients at very low or high predicted risk for ASCVD, where its yield and utility for altering clinical decisions are limited. Use of CAC testing appears to be optimal when used in selected patients who are at intermediate or borderline risk of ASCVD as a sequential decision aid after initial quantitative risk assessment and consideration of individual patient risk-enhancing factors (eg, strong family history of premature ASCVD, chronic kidney disease). Although convincing clinical trials have not been completed, observational studies strongly suggest that, in those at intermediate risk, CAC testing can meaningfully reclassify risk and can support improved targeting of drug therapy to patients most likely to benefit.

Conclusions and Relevance

This narrative review summarizes the evidence available about the appropriate role of CAC testing for ASCVD risk assessment. Coronary artery calcium testing should be used selectively in patients who are at intermediate risk of ASCVD, when there is persistent uncertainty after performing standard risk assessment using traditional risk factors in a risk score, and after consideration of additional individual risk-enhancing factors. In these situations, the result of the CAC test can be helpful to clarify whether the patient's true risk is high enough to justify initiation of primary prevention medications, such as statins or aspirin.

### Clinical implication of coronary artery calcium score [^1256eba9]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Huang and colleagues demonstrated that coronary artery calcium score (CAC) improved coronary artery disease (CAD) risk prediction, compared to conventional risk scoring, even in the absence of cardiovascular risk factor screening.Several concerns should improve their findings.

The authors discussed the cost‐effectiveness. The cost of CAC is cheaper than that of computed tomography coronary angiogram. Given that approximately 65% of their study population had risk scores <10% after application of CAC, many patients can avoid unnecessary computed tomography coronary angiogram and save costs without detailed cardiovascular risk factor screening.However, in real‐world practice, detailed interviews of chest pain and cardiovascular risk factor screening are useful to plausibly exclude the existence of CAD without further examinations including CAC.How do the authors consider the importance of detailed interview?

The authors stated that the CAC‐incorporated risk models had approximately comparable sensitivity and specificity to functional stress tests in predicting CAD.However, the definition of CAD might be different between the two tests. The former defined CAD as coronary artery stenosis >50% observed in computed tomography coronary angiogram, whereas the latter probably defined CAD as functionally‐demonstrated coronary stenosis, which would be more severe.

Lastly, some patients might have any previously implanted devices including pacemaker and cardiac resynchronization therapy with/without a defibrillator. Accurate calculation of CAC might be challenging due to artifact and the prognostic impact of CAC might decrease in such a cohort.

### Coronary artery calcium: from risk prediction to treatment allocation and clinical trials [^3909a39c]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a direct measure of an individual's coronary atherosclerotic burden. Higher levels of CAC are strongly associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and individuals with very high CAC levels have a CVD risk similar to stable persons with a prior CVD event. Conversely, the absence of CAC (CAC=0) is associated with a low long-term risk of CVD, even among groups classified as high risk based on traditional risk factors. Accordingly, the guideline-based role of CAC in allocation of CVD prevention therapies has expanded to include both statin and non-statin medications. Beyond prevention therapies, it is now widely recognised that the total burden of atherosclerosis is a stronger risk factor for CVD than a sole focus on coronary stenosis. Furthermore, evidence is accruing to support expanding the value of CAC=0 among low-risk symptomatic patients given its very high negative predictive value for ruling out obstructive coronary artery disease. There is now an appreciation of the value of routine assessment of CAC on all non-gated chest CTs and with the advent of artificial intelligence, automated interpretation is now possible. Additionally, CAC is now firmly established in randomised trials as a tool to identify high-risk patients most likely to benefit from pharmacotherapies. Future studies incorporating measures of atherosclerosis beyond the Agatston score will lead to continued refinement of CAC scoring, further improvements in personalisation of CVD risk prediction and more individualised allocation of prevention therapies to the patients at highest CVD risk.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) distribution and downstream testing—For a given CAC score, a more diffuse CAC distribution (3 coronary involvement vs. 1) is associated with higher risk, and the left main coronary artery is the only vessel where vessel‑specific CAC appears to add beyond the total score; greater left main CAC predicts risk beyond the total CAC score, particularly when ≥25% of the total CAC score is present within the left main. More diffuse regional distribution of CAC or high left main CAC involvement should generally be viewed as an additional factor favoring more aggressive preventive pharmacotherapy, should not routinely trigger downstream stress testing in asymptomatic individuals with normal functional capacity, and should only prompt further workup when there are concomitant clinically relevant cardiovascular symptoms. There are no data to support benefit of coronary angiography in asymptomatic individuals with high CAC scores, and an RCT of 5179 subjects showed no benefit on cardiovascular outcomes of an initial invasive strategy versus an initial conservative strategy.

Shared decision making (SDM) and CAC-guided risk refinement—An essential tenet of patient-centered imaging is that patients have a clear understanding of the benefits and risks of an imaging test in an SDM discussion, and the 2013 ACC/AHA Cholesterol Guideline was the first guideline to strongly emphasize the importance of SDM before initiating statin therapy to discuss patient preferences, adverse effects, and the potential for ASCVD risk reduction benefits. Because of the issues with risk factor-based risk prediction, physicians may wish to refine treatment decisions based on CAC. The most widespread application is likely to be in the 10-year ASCVD 15–20% risk group in which CAC = 0 and a low CAC scores would largely refine risk downward to lowest or low strata. In the 10-year ASCVD 5–15% risk group, downward risk reclassification may be considered with 0 or low CAC scores. There is little role for risk reclassification in the 10-year ASCVD >20% risk group, other than to provide persuasive confirmation of high risk in patients reluctant to take statins or to provide reassurance to those who are statin intolerant if they have 0 or low risk CAC. In the 10-year ASCVD <5% risk group, a 0 or low CAC score would confirm low risk status and higher scores would identify those targeted for a greater intensity of lifestyle recommendations and treatment.

### Role of coronary artery calcium score in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^821044a8]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

First developed in 1990, the Agatston coronary artery calcium (CAC) score is an international guideline-endorsed decision aid for further risk assessment and personalized management in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This review discusses key international studies that have informed this 30 year journey, from an initial coronary plaque screening paradigm to its current role informing personalized shared decision making. Special attention is paid to the prognostic value of a CAC score of zero (the so called "power of zero"), which, in a context of low estimated risk thresholds for the consideration of preventive therapy with statins in current guidelines, may be used to de-risk individuals and thereby inform the safe delay or avoidance of certain preventive therapies. We also evaluate current recommendations for CAC scoring in clinical practice guidelines around the world, and past and prevailing barriers for its use in routine patient care. Finally, we discuss emerging approaches in this field, with a focus on the potential role of CAC informing not only the personalized allocation of statins and aspirin in the general population, but also of other risk-reduction therapies in special populations, such as individuals with diabetes and people with severe hypercholesterolemia.

### Primary prevention for intermediate risk: the more things change, the more they stay the same [^eec187cd]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring is a potent tool in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk stratification. The presence and amount of CAC are directly associated with incident coronary heart disease event rates in middle-aged and older adults without known ASCVD.In asymptomatic people, a CAC score of zero portends very low coronary heart disease event rates as far out as 15 years.CAC scoring is recommended by the ACC/AHA primary prevention guidelines as a consideration in individuals at borderline (10-year ASCVD risk 5.0%-<7.5%) and intermediate risk (≥7.5%-20%) when the decision regarding statin therapy is uncertain.Because approximately 25% of the U.S. adults are estimated to be at intermediate ASCVD riskand because of burgeoning cardiovascular care costs, it is essential to understand the economic impact of a CAC-driven approach to primary prevention.

### Prognostic value of coronary artery calcium score in acute chest pain patients without known coronary artery disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^4cbd5c4f]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Coronary artery calcium score (CACS) is a well-established test for risk stratifying asymptomatic patients. Recent studies also indicate that CACS may accurately risk stratify stable patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute chest pain; however, many were underpowered. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the prognostic value and accuracy of a zero (normal) CACS for identifying patients at acceptable low risk for future cardiovascular events who might be safely discharged home from the ED.

Methods

We searched multiple databases for longitudinal studies of CACS in symptomatic patients without known coronary artery disease that reported major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), including death and myocardial infarction. Pooled risk ratios, sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios were analyzed.

Results

Eight studies evaluated 3,556 patients, with a median follow-up of 10.5 months. Pooled prevalence of zero CACS was 60%. Patients with CACS=0 had a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular events compared with those with CACS greater than 0 (MACEs: relative risk 0.06, 95% confidence interval 0.04 to 0.11, I 2 =0%; death/myocardial infarction: relative risk 0.19; 95% confidence interval 0.08 to 0.47, I 2 =0%). The pooled event rates for CACS=0 (MACEs 0.8%/year; death/myocardial infarction 0.5%/year) were significantly lower than for CACS greater than 0 (MACEs 14.6%/year; death/myocardial infarction 3.5%/year). Analysis of summary testing parameters showed a sensitivity of 96%, specificity of 60%, positive likelihood ratio of 2.36, and negative likelihood ratio of 0.07.

Conclusion

Acute chest pain patients without history of coronary artery disease, ischemic ECG changes, or increased cardiac enzyme levels commonly have a CACS of zero, with a very low subsequent risk of MACEs or death or myocardial infarction. This meta-analysis proffers the potential role of initial CACS testing for avoiding unnecessary hospitalization and further cardiac testing in acute chest pain patients with a CACS of zero.

### Coronary artery calcium testing-too early, too late, too often [^d94edda3]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Traditional risk factors, enhancing factors, and risk scores help clinicians assess atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk for primary prevention. The latest cholesterol guidelines suggest measuring coronary artery calcium (CAC) score by computed tomography (CT) in those at intermediate risk when there is uncertainty about statin initiation for primary prevention. CAC testing can improve both risk estimation and adherence to cardiovascular risk-reducing behaviors.

Observations

As measuring CAC score has become more widely available, this article focuses on 3 situations where CAC testing may be omitted or deferred until a time when CAC testing can provide clinically useful information. Three clinical scenarios to facilitate the clinician-patient risk discussion are as follows: (1) when CAC testing is too early, (2) when CAC testing is too late, and (3) when CAC testing is repeated too often. The timing of CAC testing sits within the decision point of lipid-lowering therapy use. High-risk young adults may face an elevated lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease despite a CAC level of 0, whereas older adults may not see an expected benefit over a short time horizon or may already be taking lipid-lowering therapy, rendering a CAC score less valuable. Integrating a CAC score into the decision to initiate lipid-lowering therapy requires understanding of a patient's risk factors, including age, as well as the natural history of atherosclerosis and related events.

Conclusions and Relevance

These clinical scenarios reflect when consideration of CAC score is of use and when it is not. Although CAC testing is becoming more widely available and sought after by clinicians and patients alike, it is only as useful as the clinical context. Understanding when assessing CAC score is too early to effectively rule out risk, too late to influence decisions, or too often to yield clinically relevant information provides important insights that optimize the clinical utility of this potentially valuable prognostic tool.

### Association of coronary artery calcium with long-term, cause-specific mortality among young adults [^e81aa6ab]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

CAC Testing Among Younger Adults

The recent 2018 cholesterol guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology recommend CAC scoring for intermediate-risk (10-year CVD risk, ≥7.5% to <20%) individuals who are uncertain about their decision to start statin therapy.Prior analyses have suggested that, for individuals who are uncertain about statin use, CAC testing may be the best option to determine the magnitude of the potential benefit from statin therapy. In addition, CAC scoring has been proposed to help determine an individual’s likelihood of benefit from aspirin as well as antihypertensive therapy.

Our data suggest that the clinical utility of CAC testing may extend to select younger adults, mainly those at elevated lifetime risk for CVD and uncertainty regarding treatment decisions. Even for individuals in their 30s, despite their young age, approximately 1 in 5 had CAC. Women were less likely to have CAC; therefore, CAC scoring for young women should be considered cautiously given the low likelihood of a positive finding. However, given the exponential nature of CAC progression,the presumed high lifetime risk of individuals with CAC, and the general safety and inexpensive nature of most preventive medications, considering tailored preventive pharmacotherapy in the context of a clinician-patient risk discussion appears reasonable for young men and women with any CAC.

A CAC score of 0 has been repeatedly shown to be associated with very low risk for CHD and CVD events. For young adults at elevated lifetime risk, a CAC score of 0 does not lessen the importance of heart-healthy lifestyle behaviors, but given that many patients would prefer to avoid preventive medications, the potential for CAC testing to identify patients for whom lifestyle therapies can be favored instead of preventive medications remains an important patient-centered outcome.

### Coronary artery calcium scoring to guide statin therapy by risk-enhancing factors (...) [^fb9f8e5a]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

In this cross-sectional study of a multiethnic sample of 1688 adults with an intermediate risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, most risk-enhancing factors had an absolute atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease incidence rate of less than 7. 5 events per 1000 person-years in the absence of subclinical atherosclerosis. The use of coronary artery calcium scoring was associated with significant improvements in the reclassification and discrimination of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events.

Meaning The study’s findings suggested that, among individuals at intermediate risk with risk-enhancing factors, atherosclerotic cardiovascular event rates were generally lower than the recommended threshold to initiate statin therapy when the coronary artery calcium score was 0; for cases in which additional risk stratification is required or uncertainty exists regarding the utility of statin therapy, coronary artery calcium scoring may be used to further guide the clinician-patient risk discussion. Conclusions and Relevance In this cross-sectional study, among participants with CAC scores of 0, the presence of risk-enhancing factors was generally not associated with an overall ASCVD risk that was higher than the recommended treatment threshold for the initiation of statin therapy. The use of CAC scoring was associated with significant improvements in the reclassification and discrimination of incident ASCVD.

The results of this study support the utility of CAC scoring as an adjunct to risk-enhancing factor assessment to more accurately classify individuals with an intermediate risk of ASCVD who might benefit from statin therapy. Coronary artery calcium is a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis that correlates with total coronary plaque burden and is associated with ASCVD events. 3 A CAC score of 100 or higher has been reported to equate to observed 10-year ASCVD incidence rates of 7. 5 or more events per
1000. A total of 722 participants had a CAC score of 0, 532 had a CAC score of 1 to 99, and 434 had a CAC score of 100 or more. The prevalence of high Lp was significantly greater among individuals with CAC scores of 0 or scores of 100 or more (79 participants; .

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) testing—statin withholding, reassessment, and exceptions: Caveats state that if patient is at intermediate risk and if a risk decision is uncertain and a coronary artery calcium score is obtained, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy unless higher-risk conditions, such as cigarette smoking, family history of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), or diabetes mellitus, are present and to reassess coronary artery calcium score in 5 to 10 years; moreover, if CAC scoring is recommended, it should be performed in facilities that have current technology and expertise to deliver the lowest radiation dose. Clinicians should not downclassify risk in patients who have coronary artery calcium scores of zero but who are persistent cigarette smokers, have diabetes, have a family history of ASCVD, or, possibly, have chronic inflammatory conditions, and in the presence of these conditions, a coronary artery calcium of zero does not rule out risk from noncalcified plaque or increased risk of thrombosis.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) repeat testing intervals—it is reasonable to repeat CAC scoring in adults with CAC = 0 according to baseline atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk: low risk (<5% 10 year risk) at 5–7 years, borderline to intermediate risk (5–19.9% 10 year risk) at 3–5 years, and high risk or diabetes at 3 years. In adults with CAC scores 1–99, it may be reasonable to repeat CAC scoring in 3–5 years if the results might change treatment decisions. In adults with CAC scores ≥100 and an LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL, repeat CAC scoring at 3 years may be reasonable to assess for accelerated progression (>20–25% per year) and/or an increase to a CAC score >300, findings that may favor more aggressive LDL-C lowering.

### The impact of coronary calcium score as an addition to myocardial perfusion imaging in altering clinical management (ICCAMPA trial) [^136f4c03]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

AIM: Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is a key tool for the identification and risk stratification of patients with coronary artery disease. The use of a coronary calcium score further adds to prognostic data above MPI alone. In this study, our aim was to evaluate the extent to which the use of a coronary artery calcium (CAC) score, when co-reported with MPI, impacts changes in clinical management in patients without a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing functional imaging.

Methods

This is a multicenter international study which incorporated a standardized questionnaire to evaluate changes in clinician management after MPI results were given with and without the additional information of a CAC score. Calcium scoring on a SPECT-CT system was performed via a semiquantitative Shemesh score (0-12) with a 0-3 score from the left main, left anterior descending, left circumflex, and right coronary arteries. CT of the chest was read independently, and non-coronary findings were reported alongside the CAC score.

Results

A total of 281 patients were enrolled across 3 international centers (Brazil, Australia, New Zealand). Of the 281 patients, 133 (47%) had management altered after the clinician was made aware of the CAC score. The impact of the CAC in changing clinical management was significant, particularly in patients with a negative MPI (P<0.0001), but also in MPI-positive patients (P=0.0021). The most common management change was the addition or intensification of statin therapy.

Conclusion

The addition of the CAC component to MPI yielded significant management changes in nearly half of all patients undergoing MPI for suspected CAD. This trend was observed across all centers in the three countries involved and was particularly evident in patient with a negative MPI.

### Leveraging the coronary calcium scan beyond the coronary calcium score [^dae2ed2d]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The clinical value of the CACS in terms of individual risk assessment of future cardiac events has led to an increased use of non-contrast cardiac CT in both clinical and research settings during the past decades. Many other markers of cardio-metabolic health and general health may readily be evaluated on these examinations. Clinical cardiologists, cardiovascular radiologists and medical specialists in the field of preventive medicine should be aware of this potential diagnostic and prognostic extra-coronary yield of the coronary calcium scan, and widen their professional field-of-view to look beyond the heart.

### The National Lipid Association scientific statement on coronary artery calcium scoring to guide preventive strategies for ASCVD risk reduction [^401b5e5c]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

National Lipid Association scientific statement—key points on coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring state that for a given CAC score, a diffuse distribution of CAC suggests higher risk than more localized CAC, and the presence of left main coronary calcification, especially when >25% of the total score is in the left main, suggests higher risk. There is no evidence to support the benefit of performing stress testing, or invasive coronary arteriography in asymptomatic individuals with high coronary calcium scores. A CAC score ≥100 is associated with >7.5% 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk, the guideline-based threshold of statin benefit in primary prevention. A CAC score ≥300 is associated with proportionately higher ASCVD risk than those with scores >100, suggesting benefit from greater low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering. A CAC score ≥1000 is associated with an annual risk similar to that of the placebo group in the FOURIER trial, consistent with potential value of very aggressive LDL-C lowering with other ASCVD risk reduction strategies.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score of zero—examples of candidates who might benefit from knowing their CAC score is zero and related caveats are provided: Patients reluctant to initiate statin who wish to understand their risk and potential for benefit more precisely; patients concerned about need to reinstitute statin therapy after discontinuation for statin-associated symptoms; older patients (men 55–80 y of age; women 60–80 y of age) with low burden of risk factors who question whether they would benefit from statin therapy; and middle-aged adults (45–55 y of age) with PCE-calculated 10-year risk for ASCVD 5% to <7.5%, with factors that increase their ASCVD risk, although they are in a borderline risk group. Caveats state that if a coronary artery calcium score of zero is obtained at intermediate risk and a risk decision is uncertain, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy unless higher-risk conditions are present and to reassess the coronary artery calcium score in 5 to 10 years, and that CAC testing should be performed in facilities with current technology and expertise to deliver the lowest radiation possible.

### Interpretation of the coronary artery calcium score in combination with conventional cardiovascular risk factors: the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis (MESA) [^328a5415]. Circulation (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The coronary artery calcium (CAC) score predicts coronary heart disease (CHD) events, but methods for interpreting the score in combination with conventional CHD risk factors have not been established.

Methods and Results

We analyzed CAC scores and CHD risk factor measurements from 6757 black, Chinese, Hispanic, and white men and women aged 45 to 84 years in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). CAC was associated with age, sex, race/ethnicity, and all conventional CHD risk factors. Multivariable models using these factors predicted the presence of CAC (C statistic=0.789) and degree of elevation (16% of variation explained) and can be used to update a "pretest" CHD risk estimate, such as the 10-year Framingham Risk Score, that is based on an individual's conventional risk factors. In scenarios in which a high CAC score is expected, a moderately elevated CAC score of 50 is reassuring (eg, reducing risk from 10% to 6% in a healthy older white man), but when a low/zero CAC score is expected, even with identical pretest CHD risk, the same CAC score of 50 may be alarmingly high (eg, increasing risk from 10% to 20% in a middle-aged black woman with multiple risk factors). Both the magnitude and direction of the shift in risk varied markedly with pretest CHD risk and with the pattern of risk factors.

Conclusions

Knowledge of what CAC score to expect for an individual patient, based on their conventional risk factors, may help clinicians decide when to order a CAC test and how to interpret the results.

Although CAC measurement provides a more accurate means of CHD risk assessment than traditional risk factor-based algorithms, the cost of the test, lack of widespread availability, and absence of outcomes linkage limit implementation in older patients; nevertheless, when available it may be a valuable addition to CHD risk assessment, particularly in older patients.

In 8.2.5, there is “particular uncertainty” about intermediate CAC scores and “the predictive significance of a CAC score of zero,” and “it is currently uncertain when and if follow-up CAC measurements should be done to reassess risk status.”

### Distribution of coronary calcifications in patients with suspected coronary heart disease [^c3e8d206]. American Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Coronary calcifications are a marker of coronary atherosclerosis. The role of coronary calcium scoring (CS) as part of the initial evaluation of patients with suspected coronary heart disease (CHD) is controversially discussed. The primary goal of this study was to characterize the coronary calcium distribution in this particular patient population. In a second step, we aimed to establish a possible clinical implication using CS for the diagnosis of CHD.

Methods

Calcium scoring procedure was performed by either using a multidetector or a dual-source computed tomographic scanner. All patients underwent invasive coronary angiography (ICA) as the current criterion standard for CHD detection. A total of 4,137 (2,780 men, mean age 60.5 ± 12.4 years) consecutive patients were included.

Results

Mean CS was 288 ± 446 (range 0-5,252). Overall coronary artery calcifications significantly increased with patients' age. In 2,048 patients (mean CS 101 ± 239, range 0-5252), significant CHD (≥50% stenosis) was excluded by ICA (1,939 patients without calcifications). In remaining 2,089 patients (51%, mean CS 607 ± 821, range 0-5,252), significant CHD was documented leading to intervention in 732 patients. A threshold of zero calcifications (existence of calcified tissue) had the best overall sensitivity and negative predictive value with 99%. Overall specificity with 34% and overall positive predictive value with 24% were rather low.

Conclusion

Coronary calcium scoring is able to exclude significant CHD in patients with suspected CHD with a high negative predictive value and, therefore, possibly reduce the number of invasive diagnostic examinations. Because of the low specificity and positive predictive value, CS cannot be used to indicate ICA.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) with SPECT or PET myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI)—expert consensus notes that CAC can complement MPI by enabling estimation of CAC from attenuation maps, addressing SPECT-MPI underestimation of obstructive CAD, adding prognostic information, increasing interpretive certainty for equivocal MPI, and producing greater changes in post-MPI management than MPI alone; it may be appropriate to consider adding CAC in SPECT and PET MPI protocols for patients without prior anatomic CAD evaluation.

### Carotid intima-media thickness score, positive coronary artery Calcium score, and incident coronary heart disease: the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis [^bca7c74f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Given the lack of significant difference in the NRI for a model without and with positive CAC included, we looked at the NRI for 2 models: (1) positive CAC alone, and (2) positive CAC with IMT score added to the baseline model. The NRI with the inclusion of positive CAC in the model (Table S10) was 11.1% (P =0.0001) and was 16.1% (P =0.0001) with both positive CAC and IMT added at the same time (Table S11). These results suggest a significant incremental contribution of the IMT score when added to a model with a positive CAC score and Framingham risk factors on the order of half the effect of a positive CAC score. We briefly examined how IMT score could affect the NRI for individuals within the intermediate risk category. We found that the NRI's were 11.5% for these individuals when respectively adding IMT score to risk factors alone and to risk factors with CAC. Whether this can be considered as having any value has yet to be determined. Such an evaluation will likely require more than simply calculating the NRI since it has been found to be dependent on the number of categories and the specific cut points selected. 30

It is possible to consider the potential impact of using an IMT score for patient risk stratification. The recent guidelines on the estimation of atherosclerosis cardiovascular disease risk indicated that carotid IMT might not offer added value to the pooled risk equations derived from National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute–funded observation cohorts. 31 That assessment was mostly based on the results of a meta‐analysis 1 based on a group of studies with varied common carotid imaging protocols and measurement processes. 32 One important missing element to this meta‐analysis was the absence of any ICA IMT measurements. 1 We believe that the combination of common and ICA IMT increased the predictive power of the IMT score in addition to taking into consideration its association with age. We have further demonstrated that these measurements are reliably obtainable in almost all individuals having undergone a carotid ultrasound examination.

Severe primary hypercholesterolemia—coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring stratifies atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk: in a heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia cohort of 206 patients, 49% (n = 101) had CAC = 0 with no ASCVD events, while scores 1–100 or >100 had annualized event rates per 1000 patients of 26.4 (95% CI, 12.9–51.8) and 44.1 (95% CI, 26–104.1); in a MESA analysis of individuals with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL, those with CAC = 0 had an ASCVD incidence rate of 4.7 per 1000 person-years (0.4% per year) versus CAC>0 at 26.4 per 1000 person-years (2.0% per year). These data support strong risk discrimination with CAC, and while CAC = 0 does not preclude the need for long term evidence-based LDL-C lowering therapy, CAC>0 identifies a group in which particularly aggressive LDL-C lowering strategies should be undertaken.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) progression and measurement principles: CAC scores increase by approximately 20–25% per year, and the Agatston score generally increases exponentially with scores in the range of 0–100 providing the greatest risk discrimination compared to higher scores; CAC should be measured only if such measurement will change treatment decisions and CAC does not regress; CAC progression cannot be used to measure the efficacy of statin therapy (statins modestly increase the CAC score); and in individuals undergoing repeat testing, progression of >20–25% per year or an increase to a score of ≥400 after a previous CAC score >0 is consistent with accelerated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) progression.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) serial scanning and intervals in asymptomatic adults—index CAC = 0 vs >0: A subset of patients may prefer to defer statin treatment especially if the CAC = 0. In a cohort undergoing annual CAC scanning, 422 patients with a baseline CAC score of 0 (66.4% on statin therapy) were followed for 5 consecutive years or until conversion to CAC>0, with an overall conversion rate from 0 to >0 CAC of 25.1% and a mean time to conversion of 4.1 ± 0.9 years; other data have been consistent with a 3–5 year range. Expert consensus states it may be appropriate to consider repeat CAC scanning at an interval of 5 years for patients with 0 CAC and a 3–5-year interval for patients with >0 CAC. For index CAC >0, serial evaluation may also be reasonable among patients with a CAC score of 100 or higher, and MESA data suggests that the average time to symptom-driven intervention was ~4 years.

### Coronary artery calcium scoring: an evidence-based guide for primary care physicians [^35be08e4]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Primary care physicians often must decide whether statin therapy would be appropriate (in addition to lifestyle modification) for managing asymptomatic individuals with borderline or intermediate risk for developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), as assessed on the basis of traditional risk factors. In appropriate subjects, a simple, noninvasive measurement of coronary artery calcium can help clarify risk. Coronary atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease, with atherosclerotic plaque formation involving intimal inflammation and repeated cycles of erosion and fibrosis, healing and calcification. Atherosclerotic plaque formation represents the prognostic link between risk factors and future clinical events. The presence of coronary artery calcification is almost exclusively an indication of coronary artery disease, except in certain metabolic conditions. Coronary artery calcification can be detected and quantified in a matter of seconds by noncontrast electrocardiogram-gated low-dose X-ray computed tomography (coronary artery calcium scoring [CACS]). Since the publication of the seminal work by Dr. Arthur Agatston in 1990, a wealth of CACS-based prognostic data has been reported. In addition, recent guidelines from various professional societies conclude that CACS may be considered as a tool for reclassifying risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in patients otherwise assessed to have intermediate risk, so as to more accurately inform decisions about possible statin therapy in addition to lifestyle modification as primary preventive therapy. In this review, we provide an overview of CACS, from acquisition to interpretation, and summarize the scientific evidence for and the appropriate use of CACS as put forth in current clinical guidelines.

CAC score is also a predictor of all-cause mortality. In a 6. 8-year study, patients with a CAC score of 101 to 400 or a score greater than 400 had a
5. 6- or 9. 7-fold greater risk of all-cause mortality, respectively, compared with a score of
0. 9 In a 15-year study, the survival rate was 95. 1% in patients with a score of 0 vs.
83. 7% in those with a score greater than 0.
10. “WARRANTY PERIOD” FOR A CAC SCORE OF 0 Patients with a CAC score of 0 have very low rates of CHD, ASCVD, and all-cause mortality, even those with traditional CVD risk factors. 10 A score of 0 has been associated with event rates of 0. 6 to
5. 0 per 1, 000 person-years for CHD, 0. 2 to
5. 4 for ASCVD, and 0. 87 to
1. 0 for all-cause mortality. 4, 7–9, 11, 12. CAC SCORE IMPROVES RISK DISCRIMINATION AND CLASSIFICATION For CHD and ASCVD events and all-cause mortality, CAC scoring improves discrimination provided by traditional risk factors.

It is superior to other markers, including C-reactive protein, carotid intima-media thickness, ankle-brachial index, brachial flow-mediated dilation, and family history of premature CHD. 5, 6, 10, 12, 15–20 CAC scoring also improves the risk classification of CHD and CVD provided by traditional risk factor models. The net reclassification index is the percentage of individuals who are correctly reclassified into higher or lower risk categories with the addition of CAC. In a 12-year study of 4, 962 participants who were eligible for statin therapy based on American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines but not USPSTF guidelines, a CAC score of 0 was associated with a low rate of CVD events, and a CAC score greater than 100 was associated with a high rate of CVD events. 23 CAC scoring could aid in deciding whether to start statins in patients with discordant statin eligibility.

### Coronary artery calcium scanning: clinical paradigms for cardiac risk assessment and treatment [^75ddd1c8]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scanning is being increasingly used for cardiac risk assessment in asymptomatic patients, particularly in those with a Framingham 10-year risk of 10% to 20%. Physician awareness of this technology and its appropriate uses and limitations is crucial to appropriate use.

Methods

With the goal of establishing clinical paradigms, this document integrates the results of key published articles, Framingham Risk Score, National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Plan III guidelines, American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association exercise testing and angiographic guidelines, and the authors' extensive clinical experience.

Results

Coronary artery calcium scanning is best used in the asymptomatic population with a 10% to 20% risk of cardiac events over 10 years, with selected application in higher and lower risk categories. In the 10%-20% risk patient, coronary artery calcium scores >100 or >75th percentile for age and sex transform the moderately high-risk patient to higher risk status with the attendant recommendation for more aggressive therapy; scores from 11 to 100 and <75th percentile are consistent with the 10%-20% 10-year risk status and scores from 0 to 10 and <75th percentile convert the patient to lesser risk categories. If stress testing is planned in the asymptomatic patient, it should be preceded by coronary artery calcium scanning and performed only for scores >400; it should always precede coronary angiography in these patients.

Conclusions

Coronary artery calcium scanning is an important risk assessment tool with direct clinical applications; it is of particular utility in the Framingham 10%-20% 10-year risk population.

### Coronary artery calcium staging to guide preventive interventions: a proposal and call to action [^353be7e9]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) as measured by the Agatston score is a strong predictor of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events.In the 2019 American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) clinical practice guideline for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, it is a Class IIa recommendation to use the CAC score to inform shared decision-making for individuals at intermediate risk if the decision to start statins is uncertain after global risk assessment and the consideration of risk enhancing factors.The 2022 ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on the role of nonstatin therapies for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering in the management of ASCVD risk recommended that CAC measurement be considered to inform treatment decisions for adults without clinical ASCVD when there is either clinician uncertainty or patient hesitancy about starting statin therapy.That document recommended LDL-C threshold levels for the consideration of different intensities of statin and nonstatin therapy depending on the CAC score among borderline and intermediate risk individuals. Budoff and colleagues reported subsequently that the risk for major adverse cardiovascular events of individuals without clinical ASCVD with a CAC score >300 is equivalent to the risk of individuals with a documented history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease (ie, ASCVD),suggesting that such patients could be treated similarly to those with clinical ASCVD.

Despite overwhelming evidence that CAC is a powerful predictor of ASCVD events and the aforementioned recommendations of medical societies, clinicians remain uncertain how to manage patients once they document the presence and quantity of CAC. A widely practiced, personalized approach to managing disease throughout medicine is to stage the disease. The rationale for staging is to determine the extent, severity, location, and prognosis of disease, and use this to tailor the type and intensity of therapy. Staging also provides a common language with which clinicians can communicate with each other and with patients. This approach has been adopted by the American Cancer Society. The AHA and ACC have developed a staging system to inform the management of heart failure.More recently, the AHA developed a staging system for cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome. One of the criteria defining Stage 3 in that construct is presence of subclinical atherosclerosis as defined by coronary calcium.

### Aspirin for primary prevention in patients with elevated coronary artery calcium score: a systematic review of current evidences [^22771da1]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The 2019 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines regarding low-dose aspirin in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) indicate an increased risk of bleeding without a net benefit. The coronary artery calcium (CAC) score could be used to guide aspirin therapy in high-risk patients without an increased risk of bleeding. With this systematic review, we aimed to analyze studies that have investigated the role of CAC in primary prevention with aspirin. A total of 4 relevant studies were identified and the primary outcomes of interest were bleeding events and major adverse cardiac events. The outcomes of interest were stratified into 3 groups based on CAC scoring: 0, 1 to 99, and ≥100. A study concluded from 2,191 patients that with a low bleeding risk, CAC ≥100, and ASCVD risk ≥5% aspirin confers a net benefit, whereas patients with a high bleeding risk would experience a net harm, irrespective of ASCVD risk or CAC. All other studies demonstrated net benefit in patients with CAC ≥100 with a clear benefit. CAC scores correspond to calcified plaque in coronary vessels and are associated with graded increase in adverse cardiovascular events. Our review has found that in the absence of a significant bleeding risk, increased ASCVD risk and CAC score corelate with increased benefit from aspirin. A study demonstrated a decrease in the odds of myocardial infarction from 3 to 0.56 in patients on aspirin. The major drawback of aspirin for primary prevention is the bleeding complication. At present, there is no widely validated tool to predict the bleeding risk with aspirin, which creates difficulties in accurately delineating risk. Barring some discrepancy between studies, evidence shows a net harm for the use of aspirin in low ASCVD risk (<5%), irrespective of CAC score.

### Coronary artery calcium scoring for individualized cardiovascular risk estimation in important patient subpopulations after the 2019 AHA / ACC primary prevention guidelines [^3e9a456d]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

The 2018 and 2019 American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) guidelines for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) recommend consideration of so-called "risk-enhancing factors" in borderline to intermediate risk individuals. These include high-risk race/ethnicity (e.g. South Asian origin), chronic kidney disease, a family history of premature ASCVD, the metabolic syndrome, chronic inflammatory disorders (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis [RA], psoriasis, or chronic human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]), and conditions specific to women, among others. Studies suggest, however, that risk may be highly heterogeneous within these subgroups. The AHA/ACC guidelines also recommend consideration of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring for further risk assessment in borderline to intermediate risk individuals in whom management is uncertain. Although the combination of risk enhancing factors and CAC burden (together with Pooled Cohort estimates) may lead to more accurate ASCVD risk assessment, few publications have closely examined the interplay between risk enhancing factors and CAC scoring for personalized risk estimation. Our aim is to review the relevant literature in this area. Although further research is clearly needed, CAC assessment seems a highly valuable option to inform individualized ASCVD risk management in these important, often highly heterogeneous patient subgroups.

### Personalizing treatment: between primary and secondary prevention [^d19e07dd]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for the management of patients with elevated blood cholesterol increasingly emphasize assessment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk in deciding when to initiate pharmacotherapy. The decision to treat is based primarily on mathematical integration of traditional risk factors, including age, sex, race, lipid values, systolic blood pressure, hypertension therapy, diabetes mellitus, and smoking. Advanced risk testing is selectively endorsed for patients when the decision to treat is otherwise uncertain, or more broadly interpreted as those patients who are at so-called "intermediate risk" of ASCVD events using traditional risk factors alone. These new guidelines also place new emphasis on a clinician-patient risk discussion, a process of shared decision making in which patient and physician consider the potential benefits of treatment, risk of adverse events, and patient preferences before making a final decision to initiate treatment. Advanced risk testing is likely to play an increasingly important role in this process as weaknesses in exclusive reliance on traditional risk factors are recognized, new non-statin therapies become available, and guidelines are iteratively updated. Comparative efficacy studies of the various advanced risk testing options suggest that coronary artery calcium scoring is most strongly predictive of ASCVD events. Most importantly, coronary artery calcium scoring appears to identify an important subgroup of patients with advanced subclinical atherosclerosis-who are "between" primary and secondary prevention-that might benefit from the most aggressive lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^23a6256f]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Adults with high blood cholesterol—risk enhancers and coronary artery calcium (CAC) to guide statin therapy are outlined as follows: In intermediate-risk (≥7.5% to <20% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults, risk-enhancing factors favor initiation or intensification of statin therapy. In patients at borderline risk (5% to <7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk), in risk discussion, the presence of risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy. When CAC is measured to inform treatment, if the coronary artery calcium score is zero, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy and reassess in 5 to 10 years when higher-risk conditions are absent; if the coronary artery calcium score is 1 to 99, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy for patients ≥55 years of age; and if the coronary artery calcium score is 100 or higher or in the 75th percentile or higher, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy.

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^fd9e576a]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Endocrine Society guideline—coronary artery calcium (CAC) for advanced risk assessment: Comparative analyses indicate CAC is the “single best test for improving risk assessment,” with “C-statistic change ~0.05” and “largest NRI values (~0.60) in intermediate risk patients.” CAC acquisition is practical (“about 10 to 15 minutes” and “about 1 mSv” radiation). Risk reclassification thresholds are defined: “When the CAC score is zero (CAC = 0), patients are low risk…,” whereas “When the CAC score is elevated (CAC ≥100 or ≥75th percentile for age, sex, and race),” treatment is intensified. Groups endorsed for CAC testing include “those with a 10-year ASCVD risk of 5% to 20%,” and those “with a 10-year risk <5%, with a family history of premature CAD or with another risk condition.” The 2018 AHA/ACC guideline provides “an IIA recommendation in patients at borderline-to-intermediate risk (10-year ASCVD risk 5.1%–19.9%) and in highly selected lower-risk patients…”

### Coronary artery calcium score prediction of all cause mortality and cardiovascular events in people with type 2 diabetes: systematic review and meta-analysis [^cb1f0075]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To investigate the association of coronary artery calcium score with all cause mortality and cardiovascular events in people with type 2 diabetes.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.

Data Sources

Studies were identified from Embase, PubMed, and abstracts from the 2011 and 2012 annual meetings of the American Diabetes Association, European Association for the Study of Diabetes, American College of Cardiology, and American Heart Association (2011).

Eligibility Criteria

Prospective studies that evaluated baseline coronary artery calcium score in people with type 2 diabetes and subsequent all cause mortality or cardiovascular events (fatal and non-fatal).

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers extracted the data. The predictive value of the coronary artery calcium score was assessed by random effects model.

Results

Eight studies were included (n=6521; 802 events; mean follow-up 5.18 years). The relative risk for all cause mortality or cardiovascular events, or both comparing a total coronary artery calcium score of ≥ 10 with a score of <10 was 5.47 (95% confidence interval 2.59 to 11.53; I(2)=82.4%, P<0.001). The overall sensitivity of a total coronary artery calcium score of ≥ 10 for this composite outcome was 94% (95% confidence interval 89% to 96%), with a specificity of 34% (24% to 44%). The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 1.41 (95% confidence interval 1.20 to 1.66) and 0.18 (0.10 to 0.30), respectively. For people with a coronary artery calcium score of <10, the post-test probability of the composite outcome was about 1.8%, representing a 6.8-fold reduction from the pretest probability. Four studies evaluated cardiovascular events as the outcome (n=1805; 351 events). The relative risk for cardiovascular events comparing a total coronary artery calcium score of ≥ 10 with a score of <10 was 9.22 (2.73 to 31.07; I(2)=76.7%, P=0.005). The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 1.67 (1.30 to 2.17) and 0.11 (0.04 to 0.29), respectively.

Conclusion

In people with type 2 diabetes, a coronary artery calcium score of ≥ 10 predicts all cause mortality or cardiovascular events, or both, and cardiovascular events alone, with high sensitivity but low specificity. Clinically, the finding of a coronary artery calcium score of <10 may facilitate risk stratification by enabling the identification of people at low risk within this high risk population.

### Impact of coronary calcium score on diagnostic accuracy of multislice computed tomography coronary angiography for detection of coronary artery disease [^6889fe29]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The impact of the coronary calcium score on the diagnostic accuracy of multislice computed tomography (MSCT) to detect obstructive coronary stenoses remains controversial.

Methods and Results

We examined 41 patients (mean Agatston score, 340 +/- 530 [range, 0-2546]) with coronary artery disease with 16-slice MSCT and 60 patients (mean Agatston score, 446 +/- 877 [range, 0-6264]) with 64-slice MSCT. MSCT scans were analyzed with invasive coronary angiography (CA) as the standard of reference. Lesions with luminal narrowing of 50% or greater were considered obstructive. In total, 9% and 2% of uninterpretable segments were excluded from analysis in patients examined with 16- and 64-slice MSCT, respectively. On a segment basis, the percentage of false-negative segments in the groups with Agatston scores of 0 to 100, 101 to 400, and greater than 400 with 16-slice MSCT were 0%, 5.3%, and 2.9% (P = .0005), respectively; other comparisons of false-positive and false-negative segments were not significant. The sensitivity and specificity on a vessel and patient basis with 16- and 64-slice MSCT were not significantly different in different calcium score groups.

Conclusions

A slight impact of coronary calcium was observed on the diagnostic accuracy of 16-slice MSCT CA on a segment basis, with no significant impact on a vessel and patient basis. No significant impact of coronary calcium was observed on the diagnostic accuracy of 64-slice MSCT CA on a segment, vessel, or patient basis.

### The National Lipid Association scientific statement on coronary artery calcium scoring to guide preventive strategies for ASCVD risk reduction [^9c231a95]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) = 0—statin initiation guidance and expected benefit: In adults 40–75 years of age with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 70–189 mg/dL and without diabetes, active cigarette smoking or a family history of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), it is reasonable to defer statin initiation in those with CAC = 0, and in adults age 76–80 years in whom the statin decision is uncertain, it is reasonable to use CAC = 0 as a factor favoring avoidance of statin therapy. The absolute ASCVD risk reduction with statin therapy is proportional to the CAC score, and in an analysis projecting number needed to treat (NNT), for those with CAC = 0 the NNT with rosuvastatin 10 mg daily for 5.6 years was 206, compared to 50 for CAC ≥ 100; registry data indicate patients with CAC = 0 receive minimal to no near-term benefit, and key points state that in the absence of diabetes mellitus, active cigarette smoking or a family history of premature ASCVD, statin therapy in those with CAC = 0 is associated with limited short to intermediate-term ASCVD risk reduction benefit.

### Calcium scoring improves clinical Management in patients with Low clinical likelihood of coronary Artery Disease [^b2cc8a7b]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronary artery calcium scoring (CACS) improves management of chest pain patients. However, it is unknown whether the benefit of CACS is dependent on the clinical likelihood (CL).

Objectives

This study aims to investigate for which patients CACS has the greatest benefit when added to a CL model.

Methods

Based on data from a clinical database, the CL of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) was calculated for 39,837 patients referred for cardiac imaging due to symptoms suggestive of obstructive CAD. Patients were categorized according to the risk factor-weighted (RF-CL) model (very low, ≤5%; low, >5 to ≤15%; moderate >15 to ≤50%; high, >50%). CL was then recalculated incorporating the CACS result (CACS-CL). Reclassification rates and the number needed to test with CACS to reclassify patients were calculated and validated in 3 independent cohorts (n = 9,635).

Results

In total, 15,358 (39%) patients were down- or upclassified after including CACS. Reclassification rates were 8%, 75%, 53%, and 30% in the very low, low, moderate, and high RF-CL categories, respectively. Reclassification to very low CACS-CL occurred in 48% of reclassified patients. The number needed to test to reclassify 1 patient from low RF-CL to very low CACS-CL was 2.1 with consistency across age, sex, and cohorts. CACS-CL correlated better to obstructive CAD prevalence than RF-CL.

Conclusions

Added to an RF-CL model for obstructive CAD, CACS identifies more patients unlikely to benefit from further testing. The number needed to test with CACS to reclassify patients depends on the pretest RF-CL and is lowest in patients with low (>5% to ≤15%) likelihood of CAD.

### The National Lipid Association scientific statement on coronary artery calcium scoring to guide preventive strategies for ASCVD risk reduction [^12f65c63]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

NLA scientific statement—coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring guidance for ordering and interpretation states that CAC scoring should be done only if the results will alter treatment decisions. For risk estimation, the absolute CAC score is the best predictor of absolute 5- to 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) event risk and should be used to estimate number needed to treat and guide pharmacologic treatment decisions, while the CAC score percentile derived from MESA is the best predictor of relative risk and of lifetime risk trajectory, and should be used to estimate lifetime treatment benefit.

### Diagnostic accuracy of computed tomography coronary angiography in patients with a zero calcium score [^fefbaaa7]. European Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 64-slice CT coronary angiography (CT-CA) for the detection of significant coronary artery stenosis in patients with zero on the Agatston Calcium Score (CACS). We enrolled 279 consecutive patients (96 male, mean age 48 +/- 12 years) with suspected coronary artery disease. Patients were symptomatic (n = 208) or asymptomatic (n = 71), and underwent conventional coronary angiography (CAG). For CT-CA we administered an IV bolus of 100 ml of iodinated contrast material. CT-CA was compared to CAG using a threshold for significant stenosis of >or=50%. The prevalence of disease demonstrated at CAG was 15% (1.4% in asymptomatic). The population at CAG showed no or non-significant disease in 85% (238/279), single vessel disease in 9% (25/279), and multi-vessel disease in 6% (16/279). Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of CT-CA vs. CAG on the patient level were 100%, 95%, 76%, and 100% in the overall population and 100%, 100%, 100%, and 100% in asymptomatic patients, respectively. CT-CA proves high diagnostic performance in patients with or without symptoms and with zero CACS. The prevalence of significant disease detected by CT-CA was not negligible in asymptomatic patients. The role of CT-CA in asymptomatic patients remains uncertain.

### When does a calcium score equate to secondary prevention?: insights from the multinational CONFIRM registry [^ba2cb6fb]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Elevated coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores in subjects without prior atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) have been shown to be associated with increased cardiovascular risk.

Objectives

The authors sought to determine at what level individuals with elevated CAC scores who have not had an ASCVD event should be treated as aggressively for cardiovascular risk factors as patients who have already survived an ASCVD event.

Methods

The authors performed a cohort study comparing event rates of patients with established ASVCD to event rates in persons with no history of ASCVD and known calcium scores to ascertain at what level elevated CAC scores equate to risk associated with existing ASCVD. In the multinational CONFIRM (Coronary CT Angiography Evaluation for Clinical Outcomes: An International Multicenter) registry, the authors compared ASCVD event rates in persons without a history of myocardial infarction (MI) or revascularization (as categorized on CAC scores) to event rates in those with established ASCVD. They identified 4,511 individuals without known coronary artery disease (CAC) who were compared to 438 individuals with established ASCVD. CAC was categorized as 0, 1 to 100, 101 to 300, and >300. Cumulative major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), MACE plus late revascularization, MI, and all-cause mortality incidence was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method for persons with no ASCVD history by CAC level and persons with established ASCVD. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to calculate HRs with 95% CIs, which were adjusted for traditional cardiovascular risk factors.

Results

The mean age was 57.6 ± 12.4 years (56% male). In total, 442 of 4,949 (9%) patients experienced MACEs over a median follow-up of 4 years (IQR: 1.7-5.7 years). Incident MACEs increased with higher CAC scores, with the highest rates observed with CAC score >300 and in those with prior ASCVD. All-cause mortality, MACEs, MACE + late revascularization, and MI event rates were not statistically significantly different in those with CAC >300 compared with established ASCVD (all P > 0.05). Persons with a CAC score <300 had substantially lower event rates.

Conclusions

Patients with CAC scores >300 are at an equivalent risk of MACE and its components as those treated for established ASCVD. This observation, that those with CAC >300 have event rates comparable to those with established ASCVD, supplies important background for further study related to secondary prevention treatment targets in subjects without prior ASCVD with elevated CAC. Understanding the CAC scores that are associated with ASCVD risk equivalent to stable secondary prevention populations may be important for guiding the intensity of preventive approaches more broadly.

### Prognostic value of coronary artery calcium in the PROMISE study (prospective multicenter imaging study for evaluation of chest pain) [^73456a42]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is an established predictor of future major adverse atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in asymptomatic individuals. However, limited data exist as to how CAC compares with functional testing (FT) in estimating prognosis in symptomatic patients.

Methods

In the PROMISE trial (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain), patients with stable chest pain (or dyspnea) and intermediate pretest probability for obstructive coronary artery disease were randomized to FT (exercise electrocardiography, nuclear stress, or stress echocardiography) or anatomic testing. We evaluated those who underwent CAC testing as part of the anatomic evaluation (n=4209) and compared that with results of FT (n=4602). We stratified CAC and FT results as normal or mildly, moderately, or severely abnormal (for CAC: 0, 1-99 Agatston score [AS], 100-400 AS, and >400 AS, respectively; for FT: normal, mild=late positive treadmill, moderate=early positive treadmill or single-vessel ischemia, and severe=large ischemic region abnormality). The primary end point was all-cause death, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina hospitalization over a median follow-up of 26.1 months. Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and C statistics to determine predictive and discriminatory values.

Results

Overall, the distribution of normal or mildly, moderately, or severely abnormal test results was significantly different between FT and CAC (FT: normal, n=3588 [78.0%]; mild, n=432 [9.4%]; moderate, n=217 [4.7%]; severe, n=365 [7.9%]; CAC: normal, n=1457 [34.6%]; mild, n=1340 [31.8%]; moderate, n=772 [18.3%]; severe, n=640 [15.2%]; P <0.0001). Moderate and severe abnormalities in both arms robustly predicted events (moderate: CAC: HR, 3.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.81-5.44; and FT: HR, 2.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.46-4.83; severe: CAC: HR, 3.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.99-6.36; and FT: HR, 3.88; 95% confidence interval, 2.58-5.85). In the CAC arm, the majority of events (n=112 of 133, 84%) occurred in patients with any positive CAC test (score >0), whereas fewer than half of events occurred in patients with mildly, moderately, or severely abnormal FT (n=57 of 132, 43%; P <0.001). In contrast, any abnormality on FT was significantly more specific for predicting events (78.6% for FT versus 35.2% for CAC; P <0.001). Overall discriminatory ability in predicting the primary end point of mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and unstable angina hospitalization was similar and fair for both CAC and FT (C statistic, 0.67 versus 0.64). Coronary computed tomographic angiography provided significantly better prognostic information compared with FT and CAC testing (C index, 0.72).

Conclusions

Among stable outpatients presenting with suspected coronary artery disease, most patients experiencing clinical events have measurable CAC at baseline, and fewer than half have any abnormalities on FT. However, an abnormal FT was more specific for cardiovascular events, leading to overall similarly modest discriminatory abilities of both tests.

### The National Lipid Association scientific statement on coronary artery calcium scoring to guide preventive strategies for ASCVD risk reduction [^65da41a9]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

CAC-guided low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering: A CAC score ≥100 is associated with >7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk, the guideline-based threshold of statin benefit in primary prevention; a CAC score ≥300 is associated with proportionately higher ASCVD risk than those with scores >100, a finding suggesting benefit from greater LDL-C lowering; and a CAC score ≥1000 is associated with an annual risk similar to that of the placebo group in the FOURIER trial, a finding consistent with the potential value of very aggressive LDL-C lowering along with other ASCVD risk reduction strategies.

### Utilizing coronary artery calcium to guide statin use [^806c379e]. Atherosclerosis (2021). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, and accounts for over 30% of annual global fatality. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) screening, a highly distinct marker of coronary atherosclerosis, serves as an important arbitrator of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Particularly in asymptomatic individuals, CAC testing offers a model for initiating or prolonging preventative statin therapies and subsequently up- or down-risking of patients. Though recent 2018 ACC/AHA Guidelines on Blood Cholesterol recommend CAC as an arbitrator of statin use, it remains uncertain whether these recommendations have been universally followed. Thus, we present a thorough discussion about CAC as an important determinator of ASCVD risk. In this regard we highlight the key points behind coronary artery calcium scoring, as a critical platform for stratifying risk and guiding future preventative treatments. This review paper supplies a background for the 2018 Cholesterol Guidelines: the rationalization behind CAC as a crucial arbitrator of cardiovascular risk. This paper will first (1) outline the role of CAC in reclassifying ASCVD risk. Next, it will (2) discuss studies that illustrate CAC's markedly novel reduction in the number needed to treat (NNT) to ameliorate one major cardiac event. Being years removed from 2018 Guidelines provides this paper the lens to (3) elucidate upcoming value-based advantages, cost effectiveness, and patient adherence brought by CAC. Last, this paper will also (4) extend the utility of CAC beyond that of the general population, and (5) discuss pertinent limitations brought by CAC score. By summarizing the framework behind recent cholesterol guidelines for ASCVD risk assessment, this review will address the debate of use of CAC for both the clinical setting and preventative therapy applications.

### Coronary artery calcium score combined with framingham score for risk prediction in asymptomatic individuals [^bb1fd497]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Guidelines advise that all adults undergo coronary heart disease (CHD) risk assessment to guide preventive treatment intensity. Although the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) is often recommended for this, it has been suggested that risk assessment may be improved by additional tests such as coronary artery calcium scoring (CACS).

Objectives

To determine whether CACS assessment combined with FRS in asymptomatic adults provides prognostic information superior to either method alone and whether the combined approach can more accurately guide primary preventive strategies in patients with CHD risk factors.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Prospective observational population-based study, of 1461 asymptomatic adults with coronary risk factors. Participants with at least 1 coronary risk factor (>45 years) underwent computed tomography (CT) examination, were screened between 1990-1992, were contacted yearly for up to 8.5 years after CT scan, and were assessed for CHD. This analysis included 1312 participants with CACS results; excluded were 269 participants with diabetes and 14 participants with either missing data or had a coronary event before CACS was performed.

Main Outcome Measure

Nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or CHD death.

Results

During a median of 7.0 years of follow-up, 84 patients experienced MI or CHD death; 70 patients died of any cause. There were 291 (28%) participants with an FRS of more than 20% and 221 (21%) with a CACS of more than 300. Compared with an FRS of less than 10%, an FRS of more than 20% predicted the risk of MI or CHD death (hazard ratio [HR], 14.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]; 2.0-104; P =.009). Compared with a CACS of zero, a CACS of more than 300 was predictive (HR, 3.9; 95% CI, 2.1-7.3; P<.001). Across categories of FRS, CACS was predictive of risk among patients with an FRS higher than 10% (P<.001) but not with an FRS less than 10%.

Conclusion

These data support the hypothesis that high CACS can modify predicted risk obtained from FRS alone, especially among patients in the intermediate-risk category in whom clinical decision making is most uncertain.

Severe primary hypercholesterolemia and CAC scoring—individuals with severe primary hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL) harbor a hazard ratio for clinical coronary heart disease of up to 5.0 as compared to those with LDL-C <130 mg/dL, and there is guideline consensus that all such individuals merit aggressive LDL-C lowering; however, there remains heterogeneity of risk among such patients.

### Can non-calcified coronary artery plaques be detected on non-contrast CT calcium scoring studies? [^f4b78e3f]. Academic Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

Coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiography has been shown to detect noncalcified coronary artery plaque. Depending on tissue composition, noncalcified plaque differs in CT attenuation from blood and epicardial fat. The aim of this study was to determine whether noncalcified plaque can be visually detected on non-contrast-enhanced CT calcium scoring studies.

Materials and Methods

A total of 106 patients (40 women; mean age, 59 years) who underwent coronary calcium scoring, coronary CT angiography, and quantitative catheter angiography were prospectively investigated. Two blinded observers independently reviewed calcium scoring studies for positive vascular remodeling and hypoattenuation within the vessel wall, suggestive of noncalcified plaque. Findings on calcium scoring studies were compared with those on coronary CT angiography and quantitative catheter angiography.

Results

The mean Agatston score was 515.8 ± 826.8. Overall interobserver agreement for the identification of noncalcified lesions was substantial (κ = 0.69). Observer 1 and observer 2 identified 21 and 17 patients, respectively, with 38 and 35 lesions suggestive of noncalcified plaque. Coronary CT angiography confirmed noncalcified plaque in 33 of 38 (86.8%; observer 1) and 31 of 35 (88.6%; observer 2) lesions. Thus, the overall positive predictive value for correct identification of noncalcified plaque on calcium scoring studies was 0.88, although overall sensitivity was low at 0.39.

Conclusions

Noncalcified plaque can be visually detected on calcium scoring studies. Review of calcium scoring studies for features of noncalcified plaque may enhance the identification of patients with more active disease and higher cardiovascular risk.

### Coronary artery calcium test for heart disease risk assessment (...) [^5db0ee77]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Over time, these plaques can become hardened, or calcified. The calcium in plaques can be measured by a coronary computed tomographic scan. The scan takes 10 to 15 minutes and does not require any intravenous contrast or dye. People with coronary artery calcium have some plaque and are at increased risk of having a myocardial infarction, or heart attack, with the highest risk seen in people with a lot of CAC. Most people without any coronary calcium will not have a myocardial infarction or heart blockage in the next 5 years. Because it takes time to develop CAC, some people can still have heart artery blockages and not have any CAC. This is more common in young people and women. A CAC score of 0 does not mean you do not have any plaque, although it does make it less likely.

Some people with a CAC score of 0 may choose to defer statin treatment and repeat the scan in 5 years, especially those who do not have other heart disease risk factors such as diabetes, very high cholesterol levels, a history of smoking, or a family history of myocardial infarction. Physicians typically look at a number of factors to determine a person’s individual risk of heart disease, such as cholesterol, blood pressure levels, diabetes, cigarette smoking, family history, and body weight. Many patients and physicians feel uncertain about starting medications for heart disease prevention, including people at borderline or intermediate risk of heart disease. In these cases, the CAC score can help guide treatment decisions. The CAC score can help increase certainty about a person’s myocardial infarction risk and can help make drug prescribing more accurate.

The CAC scan is a radiograph, or x-ray test, and it involves a low amount of radiation exposure, about the same as someone would receive from a mammogram. For more information, the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology and the US Preventive Services Task Force have evaluated the CAC test and can provide additional information if desired. In all patients, healthy life habits regarding not smoking tobacco products, exercising regularly, eating a healthy diet, and maintaining a healthy weight are recommended, no matter what the CAC test results show.

### Coronary artery calcium scoring: current status and future directions [^ee01c2e9]. Radiographics (2022). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores obtained from CT scans have been shown to be prognostic in assessment of the risk for development of cardiovascular diseases, facilitating the prediction of outcome in asymptomatic individuals. Currently, several methods to calculate the CAC score exist, and each has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Agatston CAC scoring is the most extensively used method. CAC scoring is currently recommended for use in asymptomatic individuals to predict the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and the disease-specific mortality. In specific subsets of patients, the CAC score has also been recommended for reclassifying cardiovascular risk and aiding in decision making when planning primary prevention interventions such as statin therapy. The progression of CAC scores on follow-up images has been shown to be linked to risk of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality. While the CAC score is a validated tool used clinically, several challenges, including various pitfalls associated with the acquisition, calculation, and interpretation of the score, prevent more widespread adoption of this metric. Recent research has been focused extensively on strategies to improve existing scoring methods, including measuring calcium attenuation, detecting microcalcifications, and focusing on extracoronary calcifications, and on strategies to improve image acquisition. A better understanding of CAC scoring approaches will help radiologists and other physicians better use and interpret these scores in their workflows. An invited commentary by S. Gupta is available online. Online supplemental material is available for this article. © RSNA, 2022.
