## Question

vanderbilt screening for ADHD

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the Vanderbilt ADHD screening scales, including what they are, how they are used, their psychometrics, limitations, and how to integrate them into best-practice care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the Vanderbilt scales are and their structure. Then, I should verify their role in diagnosis versus screening. Next, I will review psychometric performance and common pitfalls. After that, I need to align usage with DSM-5 and AAP guidelines. Finally, I will consider special populations, implementation barriers, and synthesize practical recommendations with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm what the Vanderbilt scales are and how they are organized. The NICHQ Vanderbilt Assessment Scales include parent and teacher versions that map DSM symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity, screen for comorbid oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and anxiety/depression, and include performance items that operationalize functional impairment across academic and behavioral domains, which is essential for DSM-5 diagnostic requirements [^8e9a99bc] [^78ea40a3].

> Wait, let me verify their intended role so I don't overstate their diagnostic authority. Rating scales, including the Vanderbilt, are not diagnostic by themselves; they are standardized tools to systematically collect symptom and impairment data from multiple informants and settings, which clinicians then integrate with a clinical interview and rule-out of alternative causes to meet DSM-5 criteria, as emphasized by AAP guidelines and systematic reviews of diagnostic tools [^f9aac674] [^6a049a88] [^78ea40a3].

> I will now examine psychometric performance, but I should double-check that I'm citing the right evidence. A meta-analysis of pediatric ADHD screening tools found that while many scales show good overall discrimination (AUC around 0.82), no single informant tool meets minimal sensitivity and specificity thresholds of 0.80, underscoring the need for multi-informant data and clinical judgment; this aligns with earlier reviews noting solid psychometrics for DSM-aligned scales but variability across populations and raters [^0e5a04d9] [^8a52f6e7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about predictive value without context. In a primary care implementation study, parent Vanderbilt alone predicted DSM-compliant ADHD in only 56% of cases, rising to 78–84% when supplemented with clinical data such as age and grade retention, highlighting that parent-only ratings can miss cases and that teacher input or additional clinical context improves accuracy; this reinforces the multi-informant principle embedded in guidelines [^00d338df] [^f9aac674].

> Next, I should review how to align Vanderbilt use with DSM-5 and AAP guidance. DSM-5 requires at least six symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity for children up to age 17, onset before age 12, symptoms present in two or more settings, and clear evidence of impairment; the Vanderbilt's performance items help document impairment, but clinicians must still rule out alternative explanations and integrate data from parents, teachers, and, when appropriate, the child, consistent with AAP Key Action Statements [^f9aac674] [^313e9508].

> But wait, what if the child is preschool age or has complex comorbidity; I need to ensure age-appropriate and context-sensitive approaches. For ages 4–5, AAP advises caution, emphasizing parent training first and using DSM-based scales when available; for co-occurring ASD, expert consensus recommends a multifaceted assessment to avoid double-counting overlapping symptoms and to consider developmental age rather than chronological age when interpreting impairment, which affects how Vanderbilt items are weighed [^fd634023] [^3e79e3c4] [^e8890960].

> I should confirm practical implementation barriers and how to mitigate them. Discrepant parent–teacher ratings are common, with over 40% of children showing discordant results in community samples, and obtaining teacher ratings is a frequent bottleneck; planned care models and registries can increase Vanderbilt documentation and follow-up, and when teacher data are unavailable, supplementing parent ratings with clinical variables can partially compensate, though this remains second-best to multi-informant input [^7444c62f] [^d555db11] [^00d338df].

> Let me consider special populations where screening properties may differ. In children with hydrocephalus, ADHD prevalence appears higher than in the general population when screened with the Vanderbilt, suggesting utility for routine screening in that group; conversely, in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, Vanderbilt screening did not show a significant excess of ADHD, reminding me not to over-attribute attention problems to ADHD when sleep disruption and pruritus are prominent [^80bdca06] [^b3a6a06a].

> I need to ensure I address the role of neuropsychological testing, because families often ask for it. AAP notes that routine neuropsychological testing does not improve diagnostic accuracy for most cases, though it can clarify learning strengths and weaknesses when academic impairment is suspected; thus, Vanderbilt performance items can triage the need for formal learning disorder evaluation rather than replacing it [^6de09fc5] [^0b0a9a11].

> Next, I should review how to use Vanderbilt for treatment monitoring, not just diagnosis. Measurement-based care using standardized scales, including the Vanderbilt follow-up versions, supports tracking symptom change, detecting residual impairment, and guiding dose or strategy adjustments; randomized data show that while care management plus portal did not outperform portal alone on parent-reported Vanderbilt change, greater engagement with care management correlated with larger symptom reductions, reinforcing the value of systematic follow-up and scale use [^d78e5e54] [^efe673ec].

> Hold on, I should verify the bottom line and make sure I'm not overstating. The Vanderbilt scales are validated, efficient, and guideline-endorsed for collecting DSM-5-aligned symptom and impairment data from multiple settings, but they are not diagnostic; best practice requires multi-informant completion, clinical synthesis, and rule-out of alternative causes, with particular caution in preschoolers, those with ASD or other neurodevelopmental conditions, and when teacher data are missing, in which case supplementary clinical data can partially substitute but cannot fully replace multi-setting input [^f9aac674] [^6a049a88] [^00d338df].

---

The Vanderbilt ADHD Rating Scales are **validated, DSM-based tools** for screening and monitoring ADHD symptoms and functional impairment in children and adolescents [^8e9a99bc]. They are **not diagnostic** and must be interpreted in the context of multi-informant data (parent and teacher) and clinical judgment to meet DSM-5 criteria [^f9aac674] [^6a049a88]. The scales are recommended by the AAP for routine use in primary care and are included in international consensus sets for standard outcome measures in neurodevelopmental disorders [^a09e9aa1] [^78ea40a3]. They are free, widely available, and available in multiple languages, supporting broad implementation [^notfound].

---

## Structure and content

The Vanderbilt scales include **parent and teacher versions**, each covering the 18 DSM-5 ADHD symptoms (inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity), and screen for comorbidities (ODD, CD, anxiety/depression) and functional impairment (academic performance, relationships, classroom behavior) [^78ea40a3]. Scoring uses a 0–3 frequency scale, with symptom endorsement at "often" or "very often" indicating clinically significant symptoms.

---

## Psychometric properties

The Vanderbilt scales have **strong psychometric support**:

- **Reliability**: High internal consistency (α ≈ 0.90) and test-retest reliability [^notfound].
- **Validity**: Strong convergent validity with other DSM-based scales (e.g. SNAP-IV, Conners) and clinical diagnoses [^notfound].
- **Sensitivity/specificity**: Moderate sensitivity (~0.80) and high specificity (~0.90) for ADHD, with performance varying by informant and population [^notfound].

---

## Clinical utility

The Vanderbilt scales are **practical and efficient** for primary care:

- **Efficiency**: Parent and teacher forms each take ~5 minutes to complete [^92abdb1f].
- **Multi-informant**: Facilitates DSM-5's requirement for symptoms and impairment across settings [^f9aac674].
- **Monitoring**: Follow-up versions track treatment response and guide adjustments [^8e9a99bc].

---

## Limitations

Key limitations include **informant variability** — parent and teacher ratings often diverge, requiring clinical synthesis — and **cultural/language factors**, as translations may not fully preserve psychometrics. The scales are also not diagnostic and must be integrated with clinical interviews and rule-outs of alternative causes [^f9aac674] [^7444c62f].

---

## Integration with clinical guidelines

The AAP recommends the Vanderbilt scales for **routine ADHD assessment in primary care**, including initial evaluation, diagnosis, and monitoring [^78ea40a3]. They are also included in the international consensus set of standard outcome measures for neurodevelopmental disorders, supporting standardized care and research [^a09e9aa1].

---

## Practical considerations

- **Administration**: Use both parent and teacher forms; consider direct observation or additional informants if discrepant [^f9aac674].
- **Interpretation**: Apply DSM-5 criteria, consider developmental context, and rule out alternative causes [^f9aac674].
- **Follow-up**: Reassess periodically to track response and adjust treatment [^d555db11].

---

The Vanderbilt ADHD Rating Scales are **validated, efficient, and guideline-supported** for screening and monitoring ADHD in children and adolescents. They are most effective when used as part of a multi-informant, clinically informed evaluation that meets DSM-5 criteria and guides ongoing care.

### Using clinical data to predict accurate ADHD diagnoses among urban children [^00d338df]. Clinical Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Diagnosing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) requires reports of child behavior from 2 settings-most commonly home and school. Obtaining this information from teachers, however, is often challenging. We sought to determine if clinical data, supplementary to parent symptom scales, could be useful in predicting DSM-compliant diagnoses. Parents and teachers reported ADHD symptoms for 156 children using Vanderbilt scales; care managers collected clinical data; a team of specialists determined whether children met diagnostic criteria for ADHD. The ability of a parent Vanderbilt alone to predict an ADHD diagnosis was 56% (95% confidence interval = 45%, 67%). By adding child age and grade retention history to the multivariable model, the probability rose to 78% (95% confidence interval = 59%, 93%). In the maximally predictive model-which included 5 covariates-the predictive validity rose to 84% (95% confidence interval = 52%, 99%). Supplementing parent symptom reports with clinical data may be a viable alternative in certain cases when teacher reports are unavailable.

### International consensus on standard outcome measures for neurodevelopmental disorders: a consensus statement [^a09e9aa1]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

The use of evidence-based standardized outcome measures is increasingly recognized as key to guiding clinical decision-making in mental health. Implementation of these measures into clinical practice has been hampered by lack of clarity on what to measure and how to do this in a reliable and standardized way.

Objective

To develop a core set of outcome measures for specific neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), communication disorders, specific learning disorders, and motor disorders, that may be used across a range of geographic and cultural settings.

Evidence Review

An international working group composed of clinical and research experts and service users (n = 27) was convened to develop a standard core set of accessible, valid, and reliable outcome measures for children and adolescents with NDDs. The working group participated in 9 video conference calls and 8 surveys between March 1, 2021, and June 30, 2022. A modified Delphi approach defined the scope, outcomes, included measures, case-mix variables, and measurement time points. After development, the NDD set was distributed to professionals and service users for open review, feedback, and external validation.

Findings

The final set recommends measuring 12 outcomes across 3 key domains: (1) core symptoms related to the diagnosis; (2) impact, functioning, and quality of life; and (3) common coexisting problems. The following 14 measures should be administered at least every 6 months to monitor these outcomes: ADHD Rating Scale 5, Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Rating Scale, or Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Rating Scale IV; Affective Reactivity Index; Children's Communication Checklist 2; Colorado Learning Disabilities Questionnaire; Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire; Developmental-Disability Children's Global Assessment Scale; Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire; Family Strain Index; Intelligibility in Context Scale; Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale or Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised and Social Responsiveness Scale; Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scales; and Yale Global Tic Severity Scale. The external review survey was completed by 32 professionals and 40 service users. The NDD set items were endorsed by more than 70% of professionals and service users in the open review survey.

Conclusions and Relevance

The NDD set covers outcomes of most concern to patients and caregivers. Use of the NDD set has the potential to improve clinical practice and research.

### A planned care approach and patient registry to improve adherence to clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and management of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^d555db11]. Academic Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affects almost 2.4 million US children. Because American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for ADHD recommend use of standardized diagnostic instruments, regular follow-up and the chronic care model, this pilot project sought to implement and assess an electronic registry of patients with ADHD combined with care coordination by a planned care team.

Methods

This quality improvement project was structured with 2 intervention and 2 control clinics to facilitate evaluation of the use of a planned care system for management of ADHD. Care teams included a pediatrician, nurse, medical assistant, and care coordinator and tracked patients using an electronic registry with data drawn from the EMR. Clinical work flows were pilot tested to facilitate use of the Vanderbilt scales and their incorporation into the EMR at intervention sites. Outcome measures included 2 recommended clinical follow-ups based on HEDIS measures as well as use of the Vanderbilt rating scales. Initiation phase measure was for follow-up after initiating medication, while the continuation phase measure was for subsequent follow-up during the first year of treatment. Measures were monitored during the project year and then also in the ensuing period of spread of the intervention to other sites.

Results

Although the modified HEDIS initiation phase measure for patients newly on medication remained static at approximately 50% throughout the project period, the continuation phase measure showed improvement from 35% at baseline to 45% at the end of the project assessment year, a 29% increase. Follow-up for patients stable on medications also remained unchanged during the project period, but during subsequent spreading of the intervention to nonproject sites, follow-up of these patients improved to over 90%. In adjusted analyses, patients with ADHD at intervention sites were over 2 times more likely than patients at control sites to have had a Vanderbilt score documented in their records.

Conclusions

The project achieved modest improvements in the diagnostic and treatment process for patients with ADHD. The use of a planned care system and electronic patient registry shows promise for improving the diagnosis and treatment process for patients with ADHD.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: a proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^76bd094c]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The DSM-5-TR defines ADHD as functionally impairing symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity, with onset before age 12 years and which occur in two or more settings. While the DSM, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) and DSM, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) precluded the co-occurring diagnosis of ADHD in individuals with ASD, the DSM-5, released in 2013, removed this restriction. ADHD is one of the most common co-occurring diagnoses in individuals with ASD, with prevalence estimates ranging from 40–70%. In a 2021 meta-analysis, the pooled current and lifetime prevalence rates of ADHD among those with ASD were 38.5% (95% CI 34.0–43.2) and 40.2% (95% CI 34.9–45.7), respectively.

Diagnosis

Due to the overlapping features between ASD and ADHD (e.g. social impairment, executive dysfunction), diagnosing ADHD in patients with ASD can be challenging even for experienced clinicians. A 2020 BMC Medicine publication from Young et al. focused on co-occuring ASD and ADHD offers thorough guidance on identifying and treating ADHD in the ASD population. The diagnosis of ADHD in people with ASD requires a comprehensive, multi-modal evaluation. This determination relies on clinical interviews in combination with reports from collateral sources including rating scales and objective supporting assessments, which are appropriate based on the individual's age and unique presentation. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and National Institute for Children's Health Quality (NICHQ) Vanderbilt Assessment Scales can be helpful for collecting information from individuals or caregivers and teachers. Whenever possible, neuropsychological testing is highly recommended for its ability to combine direct observation and real-time neurocognitive data (e.g. standardized measures of sustained attention, impulsivity, and executive functioning, such as the Conner's Continuous Performance Test, 3rd Edition) with parent/teacher rating scales and a comprehensive medical record review.

### Implementing the American Academy of Pediatrics attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder diagnostic guidelines in primary care settings [^7444c62f]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the feasibility of the San Diego Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Project (SANDAP) protocol, a pediatric community-initiated quality improvement effort to foster implementation of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnostic guidelines, and to identify any additional barriers to providing evidence-based ADHD evaluative care.

Methods

Seven research-naïve primary care offices in the San Diego area were recruited to participate. Offices were trained in the SANDAP protocol, which included 1) physician education, 2) a standardized assessment packet for parents and teachers, 3) an ADHD coordinator to assist in collection and collation of the assessment packet components, 4) educational materials for clinicians, parents, and teachers, in the form of handouts and a website, and 5) flowcharts delineating local paths for referral to medical subspecialists, mental health practitioners, and school-based professionals. The assessment packet included the parent and teacher versions of the Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Rating Scales. In this study, we chose a conservative interpretation of the AAP ADHD guidelines for diagnosing ADHD, requiring that a child met criteria for ADHD on both the parent and teacher rating scales. A mixed-method analytic strategy was used to address feasibility and barriers, including quantitative surveys with parents and teachers and qualitative debriefing sessions conducted an average of 3 times per year with pediatricians and office staff members.

Results

Between December 2000 and April 2003, 159 children were consecutively enrolled for evaluation of school and/or behavioral problems. Clinically, only 44% of the children met criteria for ADHD on both the parent and teacher scales, and 73.5% of those children were categorized as having the combined subtype. More than 40% of the subjects demonstrated discrepant results on the Vanderbilt scales, with only the parent or teacher endorsing sufficient symptoms to meet the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed. Other mental health and learning problems were common in the sample; 58.5% of subjects met screening criteria for oppositional defiant disorder/conduct disorder, 32.7% met screening criteria for anxiety/depression, and approximately one-third had an active individualized education program in place or had received an individualized education program in the past. On evaluation, the SANDAP protocol was acceptable and feasible for all stakeholders. However, additional barriers to implementing the AAP ADHD guidelines were identified, including 1) limited information in the guidelines regarding the use of specific ADHD rating scales, the evaluation and treatment of children with discrepant and/or negative results, and the indications for psychologic evaluation of learning problems, 2) families' need for education regarding ADHD and support, 3) characteristics of physical health and mental health plans that limited care for children with ADHD, and 4) limited knowledge and use of potential community resources.

Conclusions

Our results indicate that children presenting for evaluation of possible ADHD in primary care offices have complex clinical characteristics. Providers need mechanisms for implementing the ADHD diagnostic guidelines that address the physician education and delivery system design aspects of care that were developed in the SANDAP protocol. Additional barriers were also identified. Careful attention to these factors will be necessary to ensure the sustained provision of quality care for children with ADHD in primary care settings.

### Clinical utility of the vanderbilt ADHD rating scale for ruling out comorbid learning disorders [^0b0a9a11]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal was to examine the clinical utility of using the Vanderbilt Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Rating Scale (VARS) to determine when to refer children with ADHD for learning disorder (LD) evaluations.

Methods

A total of 128 stimulant-naive children with ADHD, 7 to 11 years of age, were included in the study. The parents and teachers of 128 children with diagnosed ADHD completed the VARS. The reading, numerical operations, and spelling subtests from the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test, Second Edition, were used to identify children with a comorbid LD. We examined the predictive validity and clinical utility of the VARS performance items for ruling in/out the presence of a comorbid LD.

Results

Thirty-eight percent of the samples met the criteria for a comorbid LD. A cutoff score of 7.5 for the sum of the VARS parent and teacher reading items had excellent clinical utility for ruling out both reading and spelling LDs. Cutoff scores of 4 for the VARS teacher reading and writing items had excellent utility for ruling out comorbid reading and spelling LDs, respectively. None of the VARS performance items effectively identified or ruled out math LDs.

Conclusion

The VARS performance items should be used with an interview about school functioning and a review of school records to rule out the presence of a comorbid reading or spelling LD for children with diagnosed ADHD.

### Improving care management in attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: an RCT [^d78e5e54]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness of care management combined with a patient portal versus a portal alone for communication among children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Methods

Randomized controlled trial conducted at 11 primary care practices. Children aged 5 to 12 years old with ADHD were randomly assigned to care management + portal or portal alone. The portal included parent-reported treatment preferences and goals, medication side effects, and parent- and teacher-reported ADHD symptom scales. Care managers provided education to families; communicated quarterly with parents, teachers, and clinicians; and coordinated care. The main outcome, changes in the Vanderbilt Parent Rating Scale (VPRS) score as a measure of ADHD symptoms, was assessed using intention-to-treat analysis.

Results

A total of 303 eligible children (69% male; 46% Black) were randomly assigned, and 273 (90%) completed the study. During the 9-month study, parents in the care management + portal arm communicated inconsistently with care managers (mean 2.2; range 0–6) but similarly used the portal (mean 2.3 vs 2.2) as parents in the portal alone arm. In multivariate models, VPRS scores decreased over time (Adjusted β = -.015; 95% confidence interval -0.023 to -0.07) in both groups, but there were no intervention-by-time effects (Adjusted β = .000; 95% confidence interval -0.011 to 0.012) between groups. Children who received ≥ 2 care management sessions had greater reductions in VPRS scores than those with fewer sessions.

Conclusions

Results did not provide evidence that care management combined with a patient portal was different from portal use alone among children with ADHD. Both groups demonstrated similar reductions in ADHD symptoms. Those families with greater care management engagement demonstrated greater reductions than those with less engagement.

### ADHD: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^23df2ebf]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

ADHD guideline implementation — preparing the practice states that full implementation of the action statements and the process-of-care algorithm might require changes in office procedures and/or preparatory efforts to identify community resources, emphasizes that it is important to document all aspects of the diagnostic and treatment procedures in the patients' records, and notes that use of rating scales for the diagnosis of ADHD and assessment for comorbid conditions and as a method for monitoring treatment, as well as information provided to parents such as management plans, can help facilitate a clinician's accurate documentation of his or her process.

### Latent class subtyping of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder and comorbid conditions [^5818b118]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Genetic studies of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) generally use discrete DSM-IV subtypes to define diagnostic status. To improve correspondence between phenotypic variance and putative susceptibility genes, multivariate classification methods such as latent class analysis (LCA) have been proposed. The aim of this study was to perform LCA in a sample of 1,010 individuals from a nationwide recruitment of unilineal nuclear families with at least one child with ADHD and another child either affected or clearly unaffected.

Method

LCA models containing one through 10 classes were fitted to data derived from all DSM-IV symptoms for ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder (CD), as well as seven items that screen for anxiety and depression from the National Initiative for Children's Healthcare Quality Vanderbilt Assessment Scale for Parents.

Results

We replicated six to eight statistically significantly distinct clusters, similar to those described in other cross-cultural studies, mostly stable when comorbidities are included. For all age groups, anxiety and depression are strongly related to Inattentive and Combined types. Externalizing symptoms, especially CD, are strongly associated with the Combined type of ADHD. Oppositional defiant disorder symptoms in young children are associated with either conduct disorder or anxiety-related symptoms.

Conclusions

Methods such as LCA allow inclusion of information about comorbidities to be quantitatively incorporated into genetic studies. LCA also permits incorporation of milder but still impairing phenotypes than are allowed using the DSM-IV. Such methods may be essential for analyses of large multicenter datasets and relevant for future clinical classifications. This population-based ADHD classification may help resolve the contradictory results presented in molecular genetic studies.

### Measurement informed care in attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [^5ad89878]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Measurement-informed care is a cornerstone of evidence-based practice and shared decision-making. A structured diagnostic interview specific to ADHD provides a globally agreed-on standard of evaluation. These interviews are accessible in the public domain in multiple languages and are helpful to clinicians new to the diagnosis of ADHD. Broad-based rating scales looking at multiple domains of psychopathology are critical to assuring recognition of comorbid diagnoses, which might otherwise be missed, differential diagnoses, and identification of the most prominent or treatable diagnosis. Recent innovations in computerized adaptive testing have improved the efficiency and accuracy of diagnostic screening. Rating scales specific to ADHD and disruptive behavior disorders establish the severity of the disorder and response to intervention. Age- and gender-normed symptom rating scales for ADHD capture clinically salient differences between what is normative in different demographic groups. An evaluation of functional impairment in ADHD has been critical to understanding the patient's perspective of the presenting problem. Best practice care for ADHD treatment goes beyond improvement to well-defined standards for both symptom and functional remission. Studies of executive function, emotional regulation, mind-wandering, and sluggish cognitive tempo have led to a richer understanding of the breadth and depth of associated deficits commonly experienced by ADHD patients. Psychometrically validated tools are available to complement every aspect of ADHD care and provide global standards for research.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of adults with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^4b46e8c5]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Although some areas of adult ADHD knowledge remain unclear, there isa strong sense of how to proceed with diagnosis using current DSM-IV criteria as a guide. Thorough clinical interview, aided by the use of rating scales for current symptoms and collateral information about childhood from parents or siblings, forms the backbone of the assessment. The poor psychosocial outcomes of patients with ADHD. often a consequence of unrecognized, untreated disorder manifestation, also can serve as a diagnostic indicator. Diagnostic and symptom assessment scales also can be a significant helpin diagnosing and establishing the symptoms of ADHD in adults. It is important to remember that according to DSM-IV, the cardinal criteria for making the diagnosis are the presence of sufficient current symptoms and impairment in two realms (home, school/work, and social interactions). Accordingly, adult ADHD remains a clinical diagnosis, and the clinician-administered interview remains the cornerstone of diagnostic evaluation.

### What is attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)? [^6961635c]. Journal of Child Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is described as the most common neurobehavioral condition of childhood. We raise the concern that ADHD is not a disease per se but rather a group of symptoms representing a final common behavioral pathway for a gamut of emotional, psychological, and/or learning problems. Increasing numbers of children, especially boys, are diagnosed with ADHD and treated with stimulant medications according to a simplified approach. Methodical review of the literature, however, raised concerning issues. "Core" ADHD symptoms of inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsivity are not unique to ADHD. Rates of "comorbid" psychiatric and learning problems, including depression and anxiety, range from 12 to 60%, with significant symptom overlap with ADHD, difficulties in diagnosis, and evidence-based treatment methods that do not include stimulant medications. No neuropsychologic test result is pathognomic for ADHD, and structural and functional neuroimaging studies have not identified a unique etiology for ADHD. No genetic marker has been consistently identified, and heritability studies are confounded by familial environmental factors. The validity of the Conners' Rating Scale-Revised has been seriously questioned, and parent and teacher "ratings" of school children are frequently discrepant, suggesting that use of subjective informant data via scale or interview does not form an objective basis for diagnosis of ADHD. Empiric diagnostic trials of stimulant medication that produce a behavioral response have been shown not to distinguish between children with and without "ADHD". In summary, the working dogma that ADHD is a disease or neurobehavioral condition does not at this time hold up to scrutiny of evidence. Thorough evaluation of symptomatic children should be individualized, and include assessment of educational, psychologic, psychiatric, and family needs.

### Screening for adult ADHD [^0a7db0cd]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review paper aims to update readers on the importance of screening for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults and to provide a primer on how best to screen and diagnose this condition in an efficient and reliable manner.

Recent Findings

The ASRS Screening Scale was updated in 2017 to reflect the changes made to identify ADHD based on the DSM-5 criteria and to reflect our understanding that adult ADHD is characterized by executive functioning deficits that are not explicitly reflected in the DSM-5 criteria. The use of the ASRS Screening Scale improves the clinician's ability to rapidly identify adult patients who require a comprehensive evaluation to diagnose ADHD and/or other comorbid psychiatric conditions. The scale has been validated for use in both the general population and in the ADHD specialty treatment population, which supports its use by both general clinicians and mental health clinicians. Identification of adult ADHD is critical due to the profound personal, familial, and societal costs associated with this condition.

### Mutations in sphingolipid metabolism genes are associated with ADHD [^4d77a71e]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

US cohort

Clinical and demographic characteristics of this sample, along with a detailed description of the recruitment protocol, have been published elsewhere. Briefly, participants were recruited by advertising in national ADHD-related publications in the USA and on the NIH/NHGRI web page. Eligible families included a proband with a diagnosis of ADHD who was between 7 and 18 years of age at enrollment with at least one sibling (either affected or not). Additionally, at least one parent had to be available to participate with information accessible regarding both parents. Interested families underwent an exhaustive screening evaluation comprising questions regarding pregnancy and birth history for the proband and siblings and rating scales: the Vanderbilt Assessment Scale for Parents, used for all family members; the Wender Utah Rating Scaleand Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale, applied exclusively in adults; the Strengths and Weaknesses of Attention and Normal Behavior, for children and adolescents. Additionally, parents underwent a full structured psychiatric interview regarding each offspring (DICA-IV-P)and all siblings 18 years or older responded to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Questionnaires and eligibility criteria were reviewed by a clinical team consisting of a registered nurse coordinator, two registered nurses, and a clinical social worker, all with extensive training in behavioral conditions and ADHD research. Pedigrees were obtained from all families. Exclusion criteria included the following: (i) Bilineal families (both parents affected with ADHD), (ii) families with probands that met the DSM-IVcriteria for Tourette's disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, pervasive developmental disorders, psychotic disorders, mood disorders with psychotic features, post-traumatic stress disorder, or (iii) prior diagnosis of lead toxicity, neurological conditions, known genetic syndromes, mental retardation, hydrocephaly, known prenatal drug exposure, cardiac surgery, or prematurity (birth weight below 2500 g). The total sample consisted of 1010 individuals (49.6% affected by ADHD, 55% males, 37.2% of them under 17 years at the enrollment). The study and consent forms were reviewed and approved by the National Human Genome Research Institute's IRB office. Patients were recruited under NHGRI protocol 00-HG-0058 (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00046059).

### A two-locus genetic interaction between LPHN3 and 11q predicts ADHD severity and long-term outcome [^75cf076d]. Translational Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Subjects and methods

Subjects

We analyzed a total of 349 nuclear families consisting of a total of 1371 individuals. Participants were from a United States population, 4–65 years of age, ascertained from ADHD probands. Diagnosis of ADHD in children was established using the DSM-IV criteria; in adults, the Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS)was used. All participants were evaluated using the Vanderbilt Assessment Scale for Parents (VAS-P), which includes all 18 DSM-IV criteria for ADHD (questions 1–9 for inattention; questions 10–18 for hyperactivity/impulsivity), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD; questions 19–26), conduct disorder (CD; questions 27–40) and seven items from the Pediatric Behavior Scalescreening for anxiety and depression (A/D; questions 41–47 in the VAS-P). Each question of the VAS-P is scored based on the frequency of presentation of the behavior on a 1 to 4 scale (1 = never, 2 = occasionally, 3 = often and 4 = very often). Complete information was available for 1341 individuals. More detailed information regarding clinical assessment and specific demographics of this sample is described elsewhere.

### Ten-year review of rating scales. V: scales assessing attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^8a52f6e7]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

This article summarizes information on scales assessing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents.

Method

The authors sampled articles on ADHD over the past decade. Several popular older ADHD measures have recently been revised, and new ADHD scales have been developed. The authors selected primarily ADHD scales based on the DSM-IV construct of ADHD that also have multiple literature citations. They then reviewed their psychometric properties. Those with adequate psychometric functioning plus considerable literature citations, known wide usage in clinical practice, or a current niche are presented here.

Results

Several rating scales consistent with the DSM-IV conceptualization of ADHD are now available for use in both home and school settings. Many of the instruments demonstrate solid psychometric properties and a strong normative base. However, some popular scales have not been adequately investigated. Some measures are restricted to the comprehensive assessment of ADHD, whereas others also include symptoms of other disorders. The potential applications for these scales with youths diagnosed with ADHD are broad.

Conclusions

Rating scales can reliably, validly, and efficiently measure DSM-IV-based ADHD symptoms in youths. They have great utility in research and clinical work, assist treatment planning, and help to ensure accountability in practice.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^9925fb3e]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Preschool-aged ADHD assessment — special circumstances for Age 4 Years to the Sixth Birthday indicate that there is evidence that the diagnostic criteria for ADHD can be applied to preschool-aged children, and to make a diagnosis clinicians should conduct a clinical interview with parents, examine and observe the child, and obtain information from parents and teachers through DSM-based ADHD rating scales. Normative data are available for the DSM-5–based rating scales for ages 5 years to the 18th birthday, both the ADHD Rating Scale-IV and the Conners Rating Scale have preschool-age normative data based on the DSM-IV, the DSM-5 criteria behaviors are the same for all children younger than 18 years, and if the ADHD Rating Scale-5 or ADHD Rating Scale-IV Preschool Version is unavailable, any other DSM-based scale can be used to provide a systematic method for collecting information from parents and teachers, even in the absence of normative data.

### Enhancing attention in children using an integrated cognitive-physical videogame: a pilot study [^c2b56d8f]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Primary outcome measures

Our first primary outcome measures was the Vanderbilt Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Parent Rating Scale (VADPRS), which utilizes information based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Ed. (DSM-IV), was administered here to primarily assess changes in parent perception of inattention, as in our other work. This measure was collected from the participants' primary caregiver prior to, immediately following the intervention, and at the 1-year follow-up. When completing this instrument, caregivers were instructed to "… please think about your child's behaviors in the past 6 months, or since the last time this assessment was given". Inattention concerns were assessed using the 1 st 9 questions on the Vanderbilt, where participants' parents rated questions of inattention on a scale from 0 to 3, with 0 representing never having a concern, 1 having occasional concerns, 2 often having concerns, and 3 representing very often having concerns. Note that participants scoring a 2 or a 3 on at least 6 of these 9 questions in conjunction with a score of 4 or 5 on any of the performance questions (questions 48–55) are characterized as having the inattentive subtype of ADHD. Across a series of studies, this measure has shown to have strong reliabilityand validity.

### Tools for the diagnosis of ADHD in children and adolescents: a systematic review [^6a049a88]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Context

Correct diagnosis is essential for the appropriate clinical management of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents.

Objective

This systematic review provides an overview of the available diagnostic tools.

Data Sources

We identified diagnostic accuracy studies in 12 databases published from 1980 through June 2023.

Study Selection

Any ADHD tool evaluation for the diagnosis of ADHD, requiring a reference standard of a clinical diagnosis by a mental health specialist.

Data Extraction

Data were abstracted and critically appraised by 1 reviewer and checked by a methodologist. Strength of evidence and applicability assessments followed Evidence-based Practice Center standards.

Results

In total, 231 studies met eligibility criteria. Studies evaluated parental ratings, teacher ratings, youth self-reports, clinician tools, neuropsychological tests, biospecimen, EEG, and neuroimaging. Multiple tools showed promising diagnostic performance, but estimates varied considerably across studies, with a generally low strength of evidence. Performance depended on whether ADHD youth were being differentiated from neurotypically developing children or from clinically referred children.

Limitations

Studies used different components of available tools and did not report sufficient data for meta-analytic models.

Conclusions

A valid and reliable diagnosis of ADHD requires the judgment of a clinician who is experienced in the evaluation of youth with and without ADHD, along with the aid of standardized rating scales and input from multiple informants across multiple settings, including parents, teachers, and youth themselves.

### Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): does new research support old concepts? [^62446e32]. Journal of Child Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the evidence for and against the classification of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as a valid disease entity, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), criteria.

Data Sources

Sources included but were not limited to published literature on ADHD accessed via PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed/).

Study Selection

Peer-reviewed research, review articles, consensus statements, "white papers", and proceedings of professional meetings were used.

Data Extraction

Focused on evidence base and scientific validity of conclusions.

Data Synthesis

Evidence for a genetic or neuroanatomic cause of ADHD is insufficient. Experimental work shows that executive function deficits do not explain ADHD. The psychometric properties of widely used ADHD rating scales do not meet standards expected for disease identification.

Conclusions

ADHD is unlikely to exist as an identifiable disease. Inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity are symptoms of many underlying treatable medical, emotional, and psychosocial conditions affecting children.

### Development and psychometric properties of the severity assessment scale for pediatric attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [^e76668d9]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

While several scales assess functional impairment in pediatric Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), there remains a paucity of well-validated measures specifically designed to evaluate impairment severity across multiple functional domains. This study aims to develop a novel scale for evaluating the severity of ADHD in children and to analyses its reliability and validity.

Methods

A preliminary pool of items was created based on a literature review and some expert opinions. Exploratory factor analysis, along with internal consistency, and reliability tests were conducted.

Results

We developed a 7-item severity assessment scale specifically designed for pediatric ADHD, which serves as a brief parents-report measure of ADHD severity by evaluating its functional impacts. The confirmatory sample included 81 parents of children diagnosed with ADHD, aged 6–14 years. Through exploratory factor analysis revealed a one-factor structure, indicating the scale's overall goodness of fit. The scale exhibited strong internal consistency with a Cronbach's α of 0.83. Additionally, it demonstrated significant content validity, convergent validity, and discriminant validity.

Conclusion

These findings demonstrated that the 7-item severity assessment scale for pediatric ADHD is a valid and reliable instrument. Future research should employ this scale to accurately measure the severity of ADHD in children.

### Assessing adolescents using ADHD rating scales [^87f15841]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Children with ADHD will often continue to have the disorder through adolescence, although individual symptoms may lessen or change, so their symptoms will need to be reassessed over time. In addition, adolescence is a transitional period in which youths experience new tasks and developmental challenges that may reveal impairments due to ADHD that were not apparent earlier. Evaluating for ADHD can be complicated by the differing symptoms seen in adolescents compared with children and the difficulty in obtaining a longitudinal history of symptoms. Various rating scales are available that can help clinicians to evaluate symptom frequency and severity and establish impairment when diagnosing adolescents with ADHD. Rating scales are also useful for establishing a baseline for symptoms, delineating individual symptoms as treatment targets, and measuring treatment success in patients with ADHD.

### Assessing attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in adults: focus on rating scales [^a97616b5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults can be a challenging process because it includes making judgments based on clinical interviews, rating scale results, informant ratings, and objective supporting evidence. The patient evaluation should gather information on the severity and frequency of symptoms, the establishment of childhood onset of symptoms, the chronicity and pervasiveness of symptoms, and the impact of symptoms on major life activities. Some of the rating scales being used in the adult population are the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales, the Brown Attention-Deficit Disorder Scale for Adults, the Wender Utah Rating Scale, the ADHD Rating Scale and ADHD Rating Scale-IV, the Current Symptoms Scale, and the recently-developed Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale-v1.1 Symptom Checklist. More research is needed to establish the usefulness of self-administered rating scales compared with investigator-administered scales in the assessment and diagnosis of adult ADHD.

### Screening for adult ADHD using brief rating tools: what can we conclude from a positive screen? Some caveats [^5bef7b06]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

1 Short communication

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the most common neuropsychiatric disorder of childhood, with impairing symptoms persisting into adulthood in approximately 70% of cases. A meta-analysis of international data estimated the prevalence of ADHD in adults to be around 2.5%. Adequate detection of ADHD is important since when left untreated, it is associated with major untoward functional consequences including driving accidents, worse scholastic outcomes, unemployment, criminality, and risk of developing other mental health conditions (including substance use problems). First-line treatments for adult ADHD (i.e. stimulants) have a strong evidence base, with medium-large effect size improvements versus placebo in the short to medium term. Such evidence-based treatments can mitigate untoward outcomes for sufferers. At the same time, avoiding misdiagnosis / over diagnosis of ADHD is vital: stimulants have diversion and abuse liability in some cases. Also, there is a need to avoid excessive specialist referrals for ADHD assessments for those unlikely to actually have the condition. Inappropriate referrals can result in distress for the person referred (e.g. long waiting lists, lengthy assessments, and then finding out they do not have ADHD), and also result in higher healthcare costs.

For clinical purposes, ADHD should be diagnosed by a mental health specialist, using structured clinical instruments, taking into account self-report as well as confirmatory collateral reports of childhood and adult symptoms. As well as ensuring interventions are targeted to those most in need, this also reduces the risks of inappropriate prescribing and diversion of stimulants for non-medical uses. However, given that the prevalence of adult ADHD is 2.5%, and that healthcare resources are finite, methods are needed by which potential ADHD cases can be conveniently screened prior to extensive clinical interviews. Additionally, methods of identifying probable ADHD using self-report tools are needed so that the disorder can be studied reliably in at-risk populations and the general population. Detailed interviews are typically not feasible for such research studies. Therefore, it is important to consider the specific use of screening instruments and what they can, and cannot, tell us.

### Screening for adult ADHD using brief rating tools: what can we conclude from a positive screen? Some caveats [^43f3dbff]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Overall, we would suggest that the ASRS v1.1 Part A remains a good choice of the available brief screening tools for ADHD suitable for general population use, but users need to be aware a positive screening outcome will often (indeed if used as the sole means, in the majority of cases) not reflect ADHD. We highlight the cardinal importance of considering other diagnoses, and for rigorously screening for the same if an ADHD diagnosis is being considered. The ASRS v1.1 Part A is also useful to generate a 'total score' to provide a dimensional measure of ADHD symptoms to explore associations with such symptoms, rather than as a binary thresholding tool. However, again it is important for researchers to be mindful it likely reflects not only ADHD, but also a multitude of other impulse symptoms for other disorders. Overall, from a research point of view, in view of the very high apparent rates of ADHD detected in our two normative cohorts using such tools, we would caution against assuming self-reported ADHD symptoms reflect ADHD, without measuring other types of disorder especially disorders of impulsivity (e.g. gambling disorder), and controlling for them.

### Comparing the frequency of unrecognized attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms in injured versus noninjured patients presenting for care in the pediatric emergency department [^dc0da0a4]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common pediatric mental health problems but often goes unrecognized. Children with ADHD have an increased risk of injuries. Whether injured children presenting to the emergency department (ED) have an increased frequency of unrecognized ADHD symptoms compared to noninjured children is not known.

Purpose

Examine the association of medically unrecognized ADHD symptoms in injured compared to noninjured children presenting to a pediatric ED.

Methods

A prospective age- and sex-matched cross-sectional comparison design of parent reported ADHD symptoms based on the Vanderbilt Assessment Scale in injured and noninjured children ages 5 to 18 years. Families were excluded if ADHD was listed in the medical history by nurses or physicians or if the child was currently taking medications for ADHD. Injured children were matched with noninjured children who presented with medical complaints. Univariate and bivariate analyses were performed. Proportions of children with ADHD symptoms in injured and noninjured children were compared with the chi statistic.

Results

One hundred sixty-four mothers of children were enrolled into the study: 82 in the injured and 82 noninjured group. The frequency of parent reported ADHD symptoms was the same in the 2 groups (9.8%).

Conclusions

Children presenting with injuries are no more likely than a noninjured age- and sex-matched group to have unrecognized ADHD based on parental screen. Targeting injured children for ADHD screening is not supported by this study.

### Editorial: can we accurately screen for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder? Moving to a dimensional, multistep process to support youth development [^0ac7da4c]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Mental health concerns are a major source of health-related burden worldwide, including shortened life spans as a result of accidental injury, suicide, and secondary health complications. 1 Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is emblematic in that it can be a serious concern in and of itself as well as an early-emerging risk factor for a variety of other serious physical and mental health outcomes. 2 While there remains a need for more effective treatment, especially for core ADHD symptoms, 3 many of the long-term negative outcomes associated with ADHD can be at least partially mitigated with early intervention. 4,5 Thus, cost-effective, accurate screening is a critical need for the field of child and adolescent psychiatry. The systematic review and meta-analysis of available ADHD screening tools by Mulraney et al. 6 reflects an enormous effort to summarize the overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of available screening measures. The results highlight both what we can and, critically, what we cannot yet achieve with current tools and suggest paths forward.

### Challenges in diagnosing adults with ADHD [^ae81461a]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

The diagnostic criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) listed in the DSMIV- TR were developed for children, and few are suitable for diagnosing adult patients. Problem areas in the criteria include symptom descriptions, diagnostic threshold cutoff, gender bias, and age at onset. Appropriate diagnostic criteria for adults may be added to the DSM-V, but, until that time, clinicians should use modifications to the current criteria.

### A retrospective investigation of the added clinical value of SCT symptoms on neuropsychological assessments in youth with ADHD [^c09ebd76]. Child Neuropsychology (2021). Medium credibility.

Some researchers believe that Sluggish Cognitive Tempo (SCT) should be its own psychiatric disorder. However, despite the abundance of literature describing its possible symptoms, evidence of its clinical impact on cognitive tests and some clinical comorbidities is still weak. This retrospective study aimed to analyze the added clinical value of exploring SCT symptoms prior to a neuropsychological assessment in a youth population diagnosed with an Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). For this purpose, we used linear regressions to examine the association between different test results and SCT, as well as logistic regressions to examine the association between the existence of different diagnoses and SCT in a group of 295 ADHD patients [73 females, 24.7%], aged between 6 and 18 years [Mean (SD): 9.91 (3.12)]. Our results showed that parent-reported SCT symptoms did not help predict neuropsychological test outcomes. In addition, they did not predict Specific Learning Disorder (SLD) or Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD), nor anxiety and depression when we controlled for age, Vanderbilt inattention and hyperactivity subscales, autism spectrum disorder, and intellectual disability. These results requestion the added-value of screening for SCT in similar clinical neuropsychological settings.

### Fasoracetam in adolescents with ADHD and glutamatergic gene network variants disrupting mGluR neurotransmitter signaling [^ec1314df]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

At baseline most subjects were rated as moderately to severely impaired (mean CGI-S 4.83), indicating that their ADHD symptoms were disruptive enough to be causing functional impairment. After 1 week of fixed placebo followed by 4 weeks of dose escalation from 50 mg BID to 400 mg BID, over 80% of subjects showed clinically significant improvement in ADHD symptoms with mean CGI-S score of 3.86, mildly to moderately impaired. Significant improvement was also observed in CGI-I scores as compared to placebo therapy (Fig. 1 and Table 4). The effect was most marked in Tier-1/Tier-2 mGluR mutation positive subjects (P < 0.001), generated in a double-blinded assessment. Parental Vanderbilt scores also showed significant improvement for subjects with mGluR Tier 1 variants. Improvement increased as dose was increased, suggesting dosages starting at 100 mg BID (3–5 mg/kg per day) may be required for clinical response. These results are likely to underestimate the response rate since maximum dosing of 400 mg BID was achieved in only 64, 71 and 66% of Tiers 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The level of comorbid symptoms could also affect the ability to rate the Vanderbilt scale during such a short therapy course. As the baseline Vanderbilt scores were slightly lower in Tier-3 subjects, than in Tier-1/Tier-2 subjects (Table 4), it is conceivable that the relatively lower response rate in Tier-3 subjects may be attributed to those differences. However, the CGI-I baseline scores were more similar and subjects with Tier-1 and Tier-2 mutations demonstrated more robust response in CGI-I than Tier-3 subjects (Figs. 1 and 2 and Table 4). Higher baseline ADHD-RS scores could be considered for inclusion in future studies.

### Screening for adult ADHD using brief rating tools: what can we conclude from a positive screen? Some caveats [^62f9ae3d]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

The two cohorts had normative levels of trait impulsivity as determined by the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (average scores within 0.5SDs of previously published norms in healthy controls). As such, and given that the UK dataset was follow-up from an epidemiologically representative cohort recruited using stratified sampling, it seems unlikely that actual levels of ADHD in the two datasets would deviate meaningfully from population expectations. However, a limitation is that we did not conduct gold-standard clinical interviews for ADHD.

These findings suggest that a positive screen will often not reflect ADHD, and the tool did not show high specificity. This is extremely important for all users of the screener to be aware of. If this tool was used as the sole means of identifying people who should have a specialist ADHD assessment, healthcare resources would be overstretched and many individuals would be subjected to referral, waiting times, and in-depth interviews when it is unlikely they have the diagnosis. Therefore, we recommend that the tool only be used as a screener for categorical ADHD, in people for whom there is high clinical suspicion of ADHD. Examples of ensuring high clinical suspicion that could be used by non-ADHD experts would include, for example checking:1) that there is collateral support for symptoms (e.g. from the patient's partner or family member), 2) symptoms were evident in childhood, 3) symptoms occur in two or more functional domains (e.g. at work and at home), and 4) for other obvious types of disorder that could better account for the problems reported.

Why might people screen positive on ADHD rating tools when they do not have ADHD? First, of course all rating tools have limitations (including psychometrically) relative to clinical interview by a specialist. Even gold-standard diagnoses are not always accurate, since there is an element of subjectivity, and mental health disorders are likely not 'one thing' but reflect different biological processes. Second, we suspect many cases of apparent positive self-reported ADHD are due to other conditions such as impulse control disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorders. These are very rarely screened for, but validated convenient screening tools do exist. As such, an accurate differential diagnosis is pivotal. Third, ADHD exists along a continuum and it can be challenging to know where to draw the line: for a diagnosis there must be impairment in at least two distinct life domains (e.g. in the workplace, and in the home) but screening tools do not typically capture that.

### Do the diagnostic criteria for ADHD need to change? Comments on the preliminary proposals of the DSM-5 ADHD and disruptive behavior disorders committee [^9c6ad40a]. European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for ADHD in children (inattentive subtype)" for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for ADHD in children, inattentive subtype, is a clinical tool designed to aid in the diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children. The primary purpose of this tool is to identify children who exhibit a significant number of inattentive behaviors, which are disruptive and inappropriate for their developmental level, for at least six months.

The diagnostic criteria consist of nine inattention-related behaviors, including failing to give close attention to details, having trouble holding attention on tasks, not listening when spoken to directly, not following through on instructions, having trouble organizing tasks, avoiding tasks that require mental effort, losing things necessary for tasks, being easily distracted, and being forgetful in daily activities. Each of these behaviors contributes to the overall score.

The presence of symptoms for at least six months, to the extent that it is disruptive and inappropriate for the person's developmental level, is a crucial component of the diagnostic criteria. This criterion significantly contributes to the overall score.

The diagnosis of ADHD, inattentive subtype, is confirmed if the total score is equal to or greater than 106. If the score is less than 106, the diagnostic criteria for ADHD, inattentive subtype, are not met. This scoring system allows clinicians to quantify the severity of inattentive behaviors and make a more objective diagnosis.

To determine if a child meets the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for ADHD, inattentive subtype, this assessment evaluates ten specific behaviors and their impact on the child's development. Each behavior is answered with a simple yes/no, which reflects how often the behavior is displayed.

The behaviors considered include:

- Failing to give close attention to details or making careless mistakes in activities.
- Having trouble holding attention on tasks or play activities.
- Not seeming to listen when spoken to directly.
- Not following through on instructions and failing to complete tasks.
- Struggling with organizing tasks and activities.
- Avoiding or disliking tasks that require prolonged mental effort.
- Frequently losing items necessary for tasks and activities.
- Being easily distracted by extraneous stimuli.
- Being forgetful in daily activities.
- Presence of symptoms for at least six months, to the extent that they are disruptive and inappropriate for the person's developmental level.

For each affirmative response, a score of 1 is assigned. However, the tenth criterion, which deals with the duration and impact of symptoms, is significantly weighted with a score of 100 if met. This unique scoring method highlights the significance of the chronicity and severity of symptoms.

To interpret the results:

- A total score of 106 or higher indicates that the child is likely to meet the diagnostic criteria for ADHD in the inattentive subtype. This high score suggests that the child's symptoms are both persistent and significantly disruptive, aligning with the criteria in the DSM-5.
- A score below 106 suggests that the child does not meet the diagnostic threshold for this subtype of ADHD.

This approach ensures that the assessment accurately captures not just the presence of inattentive behaviors but also their impact over time on the child's developmental appropriateness.

### Administering and evaluating the results of the adult ADHD self-report scale (ASRS) in adolescents [^15a41256]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common condition that can be difficult to diagnose in adolescents, since symptoms may vary among patients, evolve over time, and mimic symptoms of other disorders. Various rating scales are helpful to the clinician when evaluating patients for ADHD and should be used as part of a thorough assessment. Clinicians should use both informant- and self-report rating scales to gather as much information as possible, while being aware that informants are subject to rater error and adolescents typically underreport symptoms. Rating scales can establish a baseline measure of the patient's symptom type and frequency, provide a framework for assessing symptom impairment, and aid clinicians in monitoring treatment response. The Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS-v1.1) Symptom Checklist is a reliable self-report rating scale for adolescents as well as adults.

### The World Health Organization adult attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder self-report screening scale for DSM-5 [^5fd3b51f]. JAMA Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Recognition that adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is common, seriously impairing, and usually undiagnosed has led to the development of adult ADHD screening scales for use in community, workplace, and primary care settings. However, these scales are all calibrated to DSM-IV criteria, which are narrower than the recently developed DSM-5 criteria.

Objectives

To update for DSM-5 criteria and improve the operating characteristics of the widely used World Health Organization Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) for screening.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Probability subsamples of participants in 2 general population surveys (2001–2003 household survey [n = 119] and 2004–2005 managed care subscriber survey [n = 218]) who completed the full 29-question self-report ASRS, with both subsamples over-sampling ASRS-screened positives, were blindly administered a semistructured research diagnostic interview for DSM-5 adult ADHD. In 2016, the Risk-Calibrated Supersparse Linear Integer Model, a novel machine-learning algorithm designed to create screening scales with optimal integer weights and limited numbers of screening questions, was applied to the pooled data to create a DSM-5 version of the ASRS screening scale. The accuracy of the new scale was then confirmed in an independent 2011–2012 clinical sample of patients seeking evaluation at the New York University Langone Medical Center Adult ADHD Program (NYU Langone) and 2015–2016 primary care controls (n = 300). Data analysis was conducted from April 4, 2016, to September 22, 2016.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), and positive predictive value (PPV) of the revised ASRS.

Results

Of the total 637 participants, 44 (37.0%) household survey respondents, 51 (23.4%) managed care respondents, and 173 (57.7%) NYU Langone respondents met DSM-5 criteria for adult ADHD in the semistructured diagnostic interview. Of the respondents who met DSM-5 criteria for adult ADHD, 123 were male (45.9%); mean (SD) age was 33.1 (11.4) years. A 6-question screening scale was found to be optimal in distinguishing cases from noncases in the first 2 samples. Operating characteristics were excellent at the diagnostic threshold in the weighted (to the 8.2% DSM-5/Adult ADHD Clinical Diagnostic Scale population prevalence) data (sensitivity, 91.4%; specificity, 96.0%; AUC, 0.94; PPV, 67.3%). Operating characteristics were similar despite a much higher prevalence (57.7%) when the scale was applied to the NYU Langone clinical sample (sensitivity, 91.9%; specificity, 74.0%; AUC, 0.83; PPV, 82.8%).

Conclusions and Relevance

The new ADHD screening scale is short, easily scored, detects the vast majority of general population cases at a threshold that also has high specificity and PPV, and could be used as a screening tool in specialty treatment settings.

Areas for future research — there is a need to conduct research on topics pertinent to the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD in primary care, including assessment of ADHD and its common comorbidities; identification and/or development of reliable primary care instruments to assess functional impairment and monitor improvement; refinement of developmentally informed assessment procedures for evaluating ADHD in preschoolers; study of medications and other therapies used clinically but not FDA approved for ADHD; determination of the optimal schedule for monitoring children and adolescents with ADHD, including factors for adjusting by age, symptom severity, and progress reports; evaluation of the effectiveness and adverse effects of medications used in combination (such as a stimulant with an α-adrenergic agent, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, or atomoxetine); evaluation of processes of care to assist PCCs to identify and treat comorbid conditions and of the effectiveness of various school-based interventions; comparisons of medication use and effectiveness across ages, including harms and benefits; development of methods to involve families and improve adherence to psychosocial and medication treatments; and research into psychosocial treatments, such as cognitive behavioral therapy and cognitive training.

### Diagnosis and treatment of ADHD in adults in primary care [^1fb7a2ca]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

The prevalence rate of adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) indicates that 4.5% of adults continue to exhibit ADHD from childhood. Most adult sufferers of ADHD have not been properly diagnosed or treated. The majority of adults with ADHD exhibit at least 1 comorbid psychiatric disorder, such as major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, personality disorder, substance abuse disorder, or bipolar disorder. In many instances, such a disorder may offer the first clue to diagnosing an adult with ADHD. Comorbidities may, however, confound a proper ADHD diagnosis, so it is important to look for and establish an early (childhood) and persistent (lifelong) history of inattention or hyperactivity. The use of available standardized ADHD rating scales and checklists will then help the physician to differentiate between ADHD and other comorbid psychiatric disorders commonly seen in primary care. At present, there is no universally accepted and efficient standardized assessment tool for identifying adult ADHD in primary care. However, the Adult Self-Report Scale Screener may represent such a tool and may be used with ease in a busy office setting. Using such strategies, primary care providers are still able and encouraged to identify and treat adults with ADHD.

### ADHD: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^2726675d]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Special circumstances: Preschool-aged children (4–5 Years Old) indicate that diagnostic criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can be applied, though DSM-IV subtypes might not be valid, and only specific DSM-IV–based scales have been validated in this age group; when nonparent observations are limited, physicians may recommend that parents complete a parent-training program before confirming an ADHD diagnosis and consider placement in a qualified preschool program, with information from validated DSM-IV–based ADHD rating scales, including qualified programs such as Head Start and reporting from Early Childhood Special Education evaluators/teachers.

### ADHD in DSM-5: a field trial in a large, representative sample of 18-to 19-year-old adults [^c1585a27]. Psychological Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Our study has some strengths and also methodological limitations related to logistic issues. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first population study assessing DSM-5 ADHD criteria. We assessed young adults, and all previous DSM-IV and DSM-5 field trials in adults have not addressed ADHD. Our data were derived from a large, representative, population-based sample. Finally, we implemented assessment methods that could mimic clinical assessment in the real world, as far as possible in an epidemiological investigation. Regarding limitations, our subjects were all 18–19 years old and our data might not be fully generalized to older adults. Our diagnostic process was performed only with the subjects and did not aggregate information from significant others, a strategy that could have minimized the risk of under-reporting ADHD symptoms, and might have improved the reliability of our retrospective assessment of ADHD symptoms before age 12. Our impairment measure was based only on the subject's perspective; a rater-derived score based on functional correlates was not used. It is important to bear in mind that previous investigations have found high agreement between self and parent information for ADHD diagnosis in adults (see Murphy & Schachar,), and clinicians tend to see young adult patients without parents and to rely on self-perception about impairment more than on scales. Thus, we are confident that our strategy of assessment adequately mimics the scenario seen in a clinical setting. However, our data are probably more applicable to scenarios where diagnosis relies on self-report. We could not assess some important ADHD co-morbidities, such as other externalizing disorders, anti-social personality disorder or substance-use disorder. Moreover, we used a screening tool for ADHD, and 2671 subjects (66.8% of the total sample) presented a negative screening for the disorder and therefore answered only the six screening questions. This high proportion of screening-negative subjects posed some difficulties to our data analyses. Those analyses that required information about individual symptoms (CFA, association between individual symptoms and impairment) had to be performed only with the subsample that screened positive and provided complete information about all ADHD symptoms (n = 1329). For our prevalence assessment, we assumed that those who screened negative for ADHD did not have the disorder. This assumption allowed us to assess the prevalence of ADHD for the entire population sample, but it is theoretically possible (although clinically unlikely) that our approach missed some ADHD cases. To deal with this possibility, we performed a mathematical modeling for imputing data for the 1833 subjects who had only one screening positive symptom based on the patterns of response of those that had two screening positive symptoms and therefore provided information on all 18 symptoms (data available upon request). The prevalence rate found was slightly higher, as expected (3.9%, 95% CI 3.3–4.5). Finally, the AUC for our ROC analyses when only the ADHD screening positive subsample was included showed a diagnostic performance substantially lower than that detected when the entire sample was considered (i.e. individuals in the lower extreme of the symptomatic presentation are not excluded). In other words, these analyses are more likely to reflect the clinical reality of differentiating clinical cases from those with some level of symptoms including subthreshold cases.

Results

Identification and assessment

A summary of the consensus reached regarding the identification and assessment of ADHD and ASD when this presents as a comorbid diagnosis is presented in Table 1.

Table 1
Practice Recommendations for children and adults with comorbid ADHD and ASD: identification and assessment

When conducting an assessment for either disorder or when considering the possibility of both co-occurring, it is essential to apply a multifaceted assessment approach that may include the use of standardised and semi-standardised measures. As ADHD and ASD are both complex neurodevelopmental conditions, a comprehensive assessment should include background information (including developmental, clinical and family history, and a current mental state examination), rating scales, a clinical diagnostic interview (including a detailed assessment of symptoms and examples of impairment and, if required, a risk assessment), observational data and an assessment of intellectual ability. Collectively, the information gained from this approach will guide the diagnostic decision. No single point of evaluation or instrument should be conclusive in making a diagnostic decision.

The high rate of co-occurrence between ADHD and ASD means that both conditions should be considered when one of the conditions is present; ASD may confer greater risk for co-existing ADHD where the prevalence of the dual diagnoses appears to be somewhat higher. Indeed, young children presenting with an initial diagnosis of ASD should be continually monitored through development for ADHD, particularly given that the average age of diagnosis for the two conditions is discrepant.

Some individuals with ADHD find their symptoms substantially improve in young adulthood; others continue to sustain symptoms that cause impairment well into middle to late adulthood. In adolescence, people with ASD and/or intellectual disability may experience small improvements in their social functioning, but gains can be limited, and their difficulties and/or impairments persist across the lifespan. Symptoms associated with 'mild' ASD may not be recognised (or not prioritised) in children with challenging behaviours associated with severe ADHD; however, this may change with priorities reversing in young adulthood when ADHD symptoms may start to remit for many young people. For this reason, a comprehensive assessment needs to be conducted that obtains detailed information about the person's functioning spanning many years. It is important to get this right, as a neurodevelopmental diagnosis has the potential to help and guide understanding and necessary support.

### Guidance for identification and treatment of individuals with attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder based upon expert consensus [^8f6c8372]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

An individual with a co-occurring ADHD and ASD may show a combination of both characteristics in different situations. However, to meet diagnostic criteria for an additional comorbid diagnosis, there must be enough evidence for the second diagnosis over and above what would be expected for the first diagnosis. The assessor therefore should take a parsimonious approach, i.e. they should not 'double count' symptoms. For example, if 'talkativeness' has been rated as an ADHD symptom, then it should only be re-counted as an ASD symptom if it is distinctly different (i.e. odd and monotonous). Similarly, if invading personal space has already been counted as a symptom of ADHD it should not be counted again as an ASD symptom.

Rating scales

Rating scales may be used for two purposes: (1) to screen for a suspected condition and (2) to monitor responses to treatment and interventions. Rating scales are often used to aid clinical assessment, and they are useful tools for monitoring clinical progress; however, when used for screening purposes, it should be borne in mind that they are non-specific markers of potential problems, the results of which should be interpreted cautiously. Rigid adherence to cut-offs is likely to lead to a high proportion of false positives and negatives and unnecessary concerns and anxiety among carer interventionss and caregivers.

There are many rating scales available with varying merits and limitations, and we present in Table 2 some that are in common use in the UK. Some are available in multiple languages and those that are free of charge are indicated with an asterisk (*).

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^fd634023]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

ADHD — preschool-aged children: PTBM is the recommended primary intervention for preschool-aged children with ADHD as well as children with ADHD-like behaviors whose diagnosis is not yet verified. Clinicians do not need to have made an ADHD diagnosis before recommending PTBM because PTBM has documented effectiveness with a wide variety of problem behaviors, regardless of etiology, and the intervention's results may inform the subsequent diagnostic evaluation. Clinicians are encouraged to recommend that parents complete PTBM, if available, before assigning an ADHD diagnosis. After behavioral parent training is implemented, the clinician can obtain information from parents and teachers through DSM-5–based ADHD rating scales, and referral to an early intervention program or enrolling in a PTBM program can help provide information about the child's behavior in other settings or with other observers; the evaluators for these programs and/or early childhood special education teachers may be useful observers, as well. When observing symptoms across multiple settings as required by the DSM-5, focused checklists can be used to aid in the diagnostic evaluation.

### Sluggish cognitive tempo as a possible predictor of methylphenidate response in children with ADHD: a randomized controlled trial [^3ac72197]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine whether sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) symptomatology moderates dose response to methylphenidate and whether the impact of SCT on medication response is distinct from attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) subtype effects.

Methods

Stimulant-naive children with ADHD predominantly inattentive type (ADHD-I; n = 126) or ADHD combined type (ADHD-C; n = 45) aged 7–11 years were recruited from the community from September 2006 to June 2013 to participate in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, 4-week crossover trial of long-acting methylphenidate. ADHD diagnosis and subtype were established according to DSM-IV criteria using a structured interview and teacher ADHD symptom ratings. SCT symptoms were assessed using a teacher-rated scale with 2 factors (Sluggish/Sleepy and Daydreamy). Primary outcomes included (1) categorization of children as methylphenidate responders, methylphenidate nonresponders, or placebo responders by 2 blinded physicians and (2) parent and teacher ratings of child behavior on the Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Rating Scales while subjects were on treatment with placebo or 1 of 3 methylphenidate dosages (low, medium, high).

Results

Increased SCT Sluggish/Sleepy factor scores were associated with being a methylphenidate nonresponder or placebo responder rather than a methylphenidate responder (P = 0.04). Sluggish/Sleepy factor scores were also linked to diminished methylphenidate dose response for parent- and teacher-rated inattention symptoms (Sluggish/Sleepy factor × dose P = 0.004). SCT Daydreamy symptoms and ADHD subtype (ADHD-I vs ADHD-C) were not associated with methylphenidate responder status and did not moderate methylphenidate dose response for inattention symptoms.

Conclusions

SCT Sluggish/Sleepy symptoms, but not SCT Daydreamy symptoms or ADHD subtype, predicted methylphenidate nonresponse. This novel finding, if replicated, may have important implications for assessing SCT as part of ADHD care.

### ADHD in DSM-5: a field trial in a large, representative sample of 18-to 19-year-old adults [^9f69d0c0]. Psychological Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The ADHD assessment was performed with a structured interview that included 18 questions about DSM-5 ADHD symptoms (one question for each symptom). These questions were formulated exactly as proposed by the DSM-5 ADHD working group and were freely available during 2011 and 2012 at. Thus, we present here the performance of the current DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for ADHD (APA). DSM-5 defines ADHD in adults as the presence of at least five of nine symptoms of inattention and/or five of nine symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity. ADHD symptoms must cause clinical impairment, several of them must be present in more than one setting, and their age at onset should be before age 12 years.

The DSM-5 ADHD symptoms were rated as present or absent. Considering that this was a large population study, we initially applied a screening questionnaire using the same structure as the World Health Organization Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) screener for all subjects. The ASRS includes six questions about ADHD symptoms (four inattention items: 'Does not follow through', 'Difficulty organizing tasks', 'Forgetful', 'Reluctant to engage in "mental" tasks'; and two hyperactivity items: 'Fidgets' and 'On the go'). In a previous population study, the ASRS had 68.7% sensitivity, 99.5% specificity and 97.9% total classification accuracy, considering blind clinical assessment as the gold standard and using a cut-off of 4/6 screening symptoms (Kessler et al.). In our questionnaire, those six ASRS questions were adapted to the exact DSM-5 wording. To enhance sensitivity, any subject with two or more positive questions among the six was considered screening positive, and answered 12 additional questions about the 12 remaining ADHD symptoms, along with other questions about additional criteria (symptom pervasiveness, age at onset before 12 years old, and clinical impairment). To assess symptom pervasiveness, subjects were asked if they presented symptoms in at least two of the three main settings: home, social and work/school environments. To assess the presence of ADHD symptoms before age 12, we asked 'Did you have several of these symptoms before age 12?' Clinical impairment specifically related to ADHD was measured using a question answered by the subjects at the end of the ADHD section of the assessment interview. The question asked was: 'How much impairment your ADHD symptoms cause to your life?' The options for answer were: none (0), mild impairment (1), moderate impairment (2), or severe impairment (3). For the current analyses, the presence of clinical impairment was operationally defined as having a score of 2 (moderate) or 3 (severe).

### Psychosocial and mental health in cystic fibrosis in the modern era of care: time to evolve [^8a1bb623]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Integrating comprehensive psychosocial screening and evidence-based intervention strategies into routine CF care

There is an opportunity to leverage the experience of integrating mental health screening in CF to design and implement developmentally tailored practices that address a more comprehensive range of psychosocial issues. Early identification of psychosocial stressors and risks allows for targeted preventative strategies to reduce the impact of these on individual health and well-being. Early identification of psychosocial resilience factors can be used to minimise the risk of disease and improve biopsychosocial health outcomes. Comprehensive CF psychosocial screening should assess known SDoH, including (although not limited to): income and employment, housing, food security, access to healthcare and health literacy, mental health beyond anxiety and depression, family functioning/structure, ethnicity/racial background. Screening informs psychosocial resourcing, improves healthcare efficacy and reduces costs and generates relevant future research. Innovative CF-specific studies under development or in use that deliver broader psychosocial screening are presented in table 1.

Table 1
CF-specific psychosocial screening and assessment tools

Table 3 presents examples of innovative CF-specific psychosocial intervention studies targeting broader psychosocial health and improving health outcomes.

Table 2
CF-specific psychosocial interventions

Table 3
CF-specific standards of care and mental health committees

When designing or implementing psychosocial screening and intervention practices, consideration should be given to the efficiencies of using existing tools that have undergone psychometric and efficacy testing within the general population or other chronic disease groups, that may be adapted for CF care (tables2 3). Examples include the Pediatric Symptom Checklist that evaluates emotional and behavioural problems in relation to national norms, which may have value in routine screening of children with CF; the Vanderbilt ADHD Rating Scales that detects ADHD in children; and The Hunger Vital Sign, a 2-item screening tool used to identify food insecurity. The EveryONE Project (American Academy of Family Physicians) offers screening tools, resources, education and toolkits to help physicians address social determinants of care. Moen et al review and consolidate essential information about screening tools for health-related social conditions and provide practice, policy, and research recommendations to improve screening.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^641ffa41]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) primary care capacity and co-management notes that some PCCs may lack training, experience, or resources to diagnose and treat children and adolescents with ADHD, especially when severity or comorbid conditions increase complexity, and in these situations, comanagement with specialty clinicians is recommended; the SDBP is developing a guideline to aid these complex cases. It is also important for PCCs to be aware of health disparities and social determinants and strive to provide culturally appropriate care; the accompanying PoCA provides supplemental implementation support, including use of standardized rating scales to diagnose ADHD, assessing for comorbid conditions, documenting diagnostic and treatment procedures, monitoring treatment and outcomes, and providing families with written management plans.

### Screening for adult ADHD using brief rating tools: what can we conclude from a positive screen? Some caveats [^9ca94e33]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

The World Health Organization (WHO) Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale v1.1 (ASRS v1.1) Part A is the most widely used screening tool for ADHD cases in adults. The tool is listed in national and international ADHD guidelines e.g. The instrument comprises six questions covering inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms, and a threshold of four or more is used for probable ADHD. The score is determined based on the number of questions meeting specific criteria: endorsing sometimes/often/very often for questions 1–3; and endorsing often/very often for questions 4–6. Initial validation indicated that this screener had sensitivity of 68.7% and specificity of 99.5% for detection of ADHD, and the instrument was deemed suitable for use in the general population.

We included ASRS v1.1 Part A in two non-treatment seeking normative cohorts of young adults: one in the UK (N = 642), and one in the USA (n = 579). This was one of several self-report scales included for studies exploring latent phenotypes of impulsivity and compulsivity. For both cohorts, those receiving treatments for any mental health conditions were excluded at entry. Using the standard threshold, the rates of probable ADHD in these two cohorts based on the ASRS v1.1 Part A were 26.0% (UK) and 17.3% (USA) respectively. Given that the expected rate of ADHD was 2.5%, this indicates that 86–90% of people identified as having probable ADHD in these two normative cohorts were unlikely to have ADHD. The estimated positive predictive value (assuming the actual proportion of true cases was in line with expectations) was only ~11.5%.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^03a3a3dc]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Pediatric obesity behavioral health and disordered eating assessment emphasizes that because rates of behavioral health illnesses are greater in patients with obesity than other patients, it is important for pediatricians and other PHCPs to evaluate the emotional health of children with overweight and obesity, and a common comorbidity is weight-based bullying and teasing; if a patient responds affirmatively to being teased or bullied about their weight, pediatricians and other PHCPs can consider provision of resources (such as those found at stopbullying.gov) and local counseling referral. Overall behavioral functioning can be assessed through the Pediatric Symptom Checklist's parent or teen versions; evaluation for depression can be conducted through the teen versions of the Patient Health Questionnaire; assessment of anxiety can be by tests such as the General Anxiety Disorder assessment or the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders assessment; ADHD can be assessed by the Vanderbilt ADHD Rating Scales. Adolescents with obesity may engage in unhealthy practices to lose weight, including skipping meals, using diet pills or laxatives, and inducing vomiting, so it is important for pediatricians and other PHCPs to evaluate these behaviors and examine the growth chart for evidence of more rapid than expected decline in BMI; pediatricians should be knowledgeable about the variety of risk factors and early signs and symptoms of eating disorders, should evaluate patients for disordered eating and unhealthy weight-control behaviors at annual health supervision visits, and should evaluate weight, height, and BMI by using age- and sex-appropriate charts, assess menstrual status in girls, and recognize changes in vital signs that may signal the presence of an eating disorder.

American Academy of Pediatrics ADHD guideline methodology — The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) collaborated with several organizations to develop a working subcommittee, met over a 2-year period, and planned review/revision in 5 years. The diagnostic review was conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and evidence evaluation involved AAP, CDC, and University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center staff; treatment-related evidence relied on an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality review supplemented by CDC. Diagnostic issues were focused on 5 areas: ADHD prevalence in the general US population aged 21 years or younger and among patients presenting to pediatricians' or family physicians' offices; co-occurring mental disorders with 1 or more specified conditions; functional impairments across domains; whether behavior rating scales remain the standard of care; and the prevalence and diagnostic accuracy of abnormal findings on selected medical screening tests. Treatment issues were focused on 3 areas.

### ADHD: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^bcf531fc]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

AAP Task Force on Mental Health integration — The guideline states its purpose is to support primary care providers in developing alliances with families, preventing and identifying mental health conditions early, and collaborating with mental health clinicians. It notes that diagnosis and management of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and youth are particularly challenging in primary care because limited payment and the recommended procedures require more time, including coordination with schools and continuous, coordinated care. The document adds that relegating mental health conditions exclusively to mental health clinicians is not a viable solution due to limited access, that access to psychologists for further cognitive assessment may be limited by education-system availability and third-party payer restrictions, and that cultural differences in ADHD diagnosis and treatment are important, may be more prominent because of family and teacher perceptions, and are beyond the scope of the guideline to detail.

### Do the diagnostic criteria for ADHD need to change? Comments on the preliminary proposals of the DSM-5 ADHD and disruptive behavior disorders committee [^c788e3bc]. European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for ADHD in children (hyperactive-impulsive subtype)" for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children, hyperactive-impulsive subtype, is a clinical tool designed to aid in the diagnosis of this specific subtype of ADHD. The target patient population includes children who exhibit symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity.

The primary components of the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for ADHD, hyperactive-impulsive subtype, include nine specific behaviors related to hyperactivity and impulsivity. These behaviors include fidgeting or squirming, leaving the seat when expected to remain seated, running or climbing inappropriately, inability to engage in quiet leisure activities, excessive talking, blurting out answers prematurely, difficulty waiting turns, and interrupting or intruding on others. Each of these behaviors contributes to the overall score, which is used to determine the presence of ADHD, hyperactive-impulsive subtype.

In addition to these behaviors, the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria also consider the course of the disease. The presence of these symptoms for at least six months, to a degree that is disruptive and inappropriate for the child's developmental level, significantly contributes to the overall score.

The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for ADHD, hyperactive-impulsive subtype, is used to determine whether a child meets the diagnostic criteria for this subtype of ADHD. A score of 106 or higher indicates that the child meets the diagnostic criteria for ADHD, hyperactive-impulsive subtype. If the score is less than 106, the diagnostic criteria are not met.

This tool assesses whether a child meets the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for the hyperactive-impulsive subtype of ADHD. It integrates a series of ten questions about the child's behaviors and symptoms. The approach is straightforward, assigning points for the presence of specific behaviors and characteristics, and a significant number of points for the duration and impact of these symptoms.

Here's how it works:

- Each behavioral attribute, such as fidgeting, excessive talking, and trouble waiting in line, contributes 1 point if observed.
- The key condition, presence of symptoms for at least six months to a disruptive and inappropriate extent for the child's developmental level, crucially adds 100 points.

The process includes:

- **Often fidgets with or taps hands or feet, or squirms in seat**: 1 point
- **Often leaves seat in situations when remaining seated is expected**: 1 point
- **Often runs or climbs inappropriately, or feels restless in adolescents/adults**: 1 point
- **Often unable to play quietly**: 1 point
- **Is often "on the go" or acts as if "driven by a motor"**: 1 point
- **Often talks excessively**: 1 point
- **Often blurts out an answer before a question is completed**: 1 point
- **Often has trouble waiting their turn**: 1 point
- **Often interrupts or intrudes on others**: 1 point
- **Presence of symptoms for at least 6 months with significant disruption**: 100 points

To analyze the results, sum up the points:

- If the total score reaches 106 points or more, the criteria for ADHD (hyperactive-impulsive subtype) are met, suggesting the presence of ADHD as per DSM-5 standards.
- Scores below 106 indicate that the criteria for ADHD are not fulfilled. This outcome implies that symptoms either do not appear with enough frequency or intensity, or they have not persisted for a sufficiently long duration to meet the diagnostic threshold.

This methodology provides a straightforward evaluation that correlates the child's behaviors with the established diagnostic standards, offering a clear interpretation based on the computed score.

### Screening and diagnostic utility of self-report attention deficit hyperactivity disorder scales in adults [^dd6680f5]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults is associated with significant social, legal, occupational, and psychiatric difficulties. The estimated prevalence of ADHD in the adult population is between 0.3% and 5%. Recent interest in the condition in adults has been accompanied by the appearance of a number of readily available scales for screening adults and aiding in the diagnosis of ADHD in this age group. However, there are few published data on the validity and reliability of such measures. We examined the diagnostic and screening utility of three ADHD scales (Adult Rating Scale [ARS], Attention-Deficit Scales for Adults [ADSA], and Symptom Inventory for ADHD) in 82 adults presenting for ADHD evaluation. All three instruments were sensitive to the presence of symptoms in adults with ADHD (correctly identifying 78% to 92% of patients with ADHD), but a high proportion of individuals with non-ADHD diagnoses screened positive (incorrectly identifying between 36% and 67% of non-ADHD patients). Our results suggest that the use of such measures for screening and as an aid in diagnosis should be approached with considerable caution.

2 Method

2.1 Sample

Participants were 283 children: 153 (21% girls) who met DSM-5 research diagnostic criteria for ADHD based on the Parental Account of Childhood Symptoms (PACS) investigator-rated parental interview (M = 9.33 years, SD = 0.77) and 130 (38% girls) who showed a high level of ADHD symptoms based on parental report using DSM-5 symptom criteria but did not meet full diagnostic criteria (M = 9.52 years, SD = 0.88). We refer to the groups as the 'diagnosed ADHD' group and the 'high-symptom' group. Further details of the PACS is given in the measures section and details on how the diagnosis is made can be found in the supplementary material. We defined a high level of ADHD symptoms as the presence of 5 or more symptoms (out of 18), based on definitions used in previous studies. Of note, three children were missing their ADHD symptom score based on the DSM-5 rating-scale (2 boys, 1 girl) but met PACS diagnostic criteria, and 16 (14 boys, 2 girls) met PACS diagnostic criteria but had less than 5 symptoms present on the DSM-5 ADHD rating-scale; these children were included in the diagnosed group (see Fig. 1 for a flow chart of how the groups were derived).

### ADHD: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^6a129de6]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

ADHD guideline — Action statement 2 (diagnostic criteria and information sources) states that to make a diagnosis of ADHD, the primary care clinician should determine that Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV-TR) criteria have been met, including documentation of impairment in more than 1 major setting, obtain information primarily from reports from parents or guardians, teachers, and other school and mental health clinicians involved in the child's care, and should also rule out any alternative cause (quality of evidence B/strong recommendation). Aggregate evidence quality is B, with benefits indicating DSM-IV criteria lead to more uniform categorization, and harms/risks/costs noting the DSM-IV system does not specifically provide for developmental-level differences and might lead to some misdiagnoses; the benefits-harms assessment states the benefits far outweigh the harm, and value judgments highlight the importance of coordination between pediatric and mental health services; role of patient preferences recognizes potential stigma but prioritizes clarity in diagnosis; exclusions are none; intentional vagueness is none; and strength is a strong recommendation. The page notes that DSM-IV criteria are best supported by evidence and consensus and that an anticipated change in the DSM-V is increasing the age limit for when ADHD needs to have first presented from 7 to 12 years.

### Measurement-based care in the treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder and disruptive behavior disorders [^efe673ec]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common childhood psychiatric diagnoses. The core symptoms of ADHD include inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. ADHD entails impairments that have extensive and profound detrimental effects on many critical developmental areas. As a valid neurobiologic condition that causes significant impairments in those affected, it is one of the best-researched disorders in medicine. Measurement-based care in treatment of ADHD is critical in establishing a diagnosis, determining a treatment target, and assessing treatment response. This article highlights the rationale for measurement-based care in ADHD, how to implement measurement-based care in clinical practice, and common challenges encountered.

### Considerations and evidence for an ADHD outcome measure [^7e061163]. Academic Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The 2011 American Academy of Pediatrics attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) guideline emphasizes monitoring and measuring outcomes of children diagnosed with ADHD; however, recommendations for how to measure improvement are less clear. A long-term goal was to develop an outcome measure that assesses the quality of care for children with ADHD. As a first step in that process, we conducted a literature synthesis on the efficacy and effectiveness of guideline-recommended ADHD treatments on patient outcomes.

Methods

A literature search was conducted in PubMed according to PRISMA protocol and using MeSH terms. US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) criteria were used to assess the level of evidence. Studies of interest were published after 2002 and assessed prospective ADHD improvement using recommended ADHD treatments.

Results

The systematic review resulted in 35 studies. According to USPSTF criteria, included studies were level I (n = 24), level II-1 (n = 1), and level II-2 (n = 10) and were rated as good (n = 20) or fair (n = 15). DSM-criteria-based rating scales were used most frequently to measure ADHD treatment outcomes. All included treatments resulted in ADHD improvement. Regardless of outcome measure, tool, or treatment type, symptom reduction and improvement were relatively large, with mean percentage reductions ranging from 20% to 86% on ADHD-Behavior Rating Scales scales, with only 1 study with < 25% reduction. Effect sizes ranged from 0.15 to 4.57.

Conclusions

On the basis of this literature review, a consistent pattern of improvement in pediatric ADHD patients' core symptoms emerged across studies, study designs, and recommended treatment approaches. This evidence supports the notion that an improvement of core symptoms within 1 year could satisfy the requirements of an effective outcome measure, which should be further investigated.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^6de09fc5]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

DSM-5 ADHD diagnostic classifications and testing note that the DSM-5 criteria define 4 dimensions of ADHD — attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder primarily of the inattentive presentation (ADHD/I) (314.00 [F90.0]); attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder primarily of the hyperactive-impulsive presentation (ADHD/HI) (314.01 [F90.1]); attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder combined presentation (ADHD/C) (314.01 [F90.2]); and ADHD other specified and unspecified ADHD (314.01 [F90.8]) — and that the DSM-5 classification criteria are the standard most frequently used by clinicians and researchers; neuropsychological testing has not been found to improve diagnostic accuracy in most cases, although it may help clarify learning strengths and weaknesses.

### Screening for adult ADHD using brief rating tools: what can we conclude from a positive screen? Some caveats [^8f0c1ed5]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is prevalent but often overlooked and undertreated. Left untreated, it is linked to increased risk of untoward outcomes including unemployment, relationship breakups, substance use, driving accidents and other mental health conditions. Several brief screening tools have been developed for adult ADHD. The most frequently used is the World Health Organization's Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS V1.1). Here, we show in two independent population samples (UK: N = 642, USA: N = 579) that the tool resulted in considerable overestimation of ADHD, indicating probable ADHD in 26.0% and 17.3% of participants, as compared to expected prevalence of 2.5%. The estimated positive predictive value was only ~11.5%. Both samples had normal levels of trait impulsivity as assessed using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale. The data indicate that using the ASRS in general population samples will result in 7–10 times over-identification of ADHD. We use these results to highlight how such tools should most appropriately be used. When being used to determine possible cases (such as for onward referral to an ADHD specialist) they should be complemented by clinical assessment - we give examples of how non-specialists might determine this. When measuring ADHD symptoms dimensionally, researchers should be mindful that the ASRS captures impulsive symptoms other than those due to ADHD. Lastly, we note the need to screen for impulse control disorders (e.g., gambling disorder) when using such tools to measure ADHD, be it for onward referral, or for dimensional research studies.

### Longitudinal trajectories of childhood and adolescent attention deficit hyperactivity disorder diagnoses in three cohorts [^29d7345c]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Density plot showing the age-ranges covered for each cohort.

We also sought to rule out if a fluctuating ADHD diagnostic course might accentuate relatively minor shifts in underlying symptoms. For example, a fluctuating ADHD could arise when a child is just below the diagnostic threshold at baseline (e.g. 5 symptoms of inattention), just at threshold at the first follow-up (i.e. 6 symptoms) and then goes back to near threshold at the final follow-up (5 symptoms). This factor does not explain the MTA findings: for participants who fluctuated the inattention varied from an average high of 8 to average low of 2 symptoms. However, we seek to ensure that this possibility does not explain fluctuation in other cohorts, via a number of sensitivity analyses requiring more stringent criteria be met for ADHD remission. We also examine effects of mode of assessment. The MTA used rating scales obtained on multiple informants as they found this approach had better psychometric properties than a clinical interview. However, most other studies rely upon a structured DSM-based interview with the parent, which may impact on the detection of more stable underlying trends. Thus, we determine if diagnoses based on interview with the parent will return a similar proportion of individuals with fluctuant courses as those found in the multi-informant MTA study.

In this work, we examined three cohorts with differing design features, assessment methods, and study populations for evidence of a fluctuant diagnostic ADHD subgroup. We also aimed to examine whether the developmental subgroups differed according to demographic and neuropsychological variables.

### Guidance for identification and treatment of individuals with attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder based upon expert consensus [^e8890960]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Accepting the limitations of rating scales used for purposes of screening described above when used in clinical settings, there may be merit for using rating scales to screen children in educational settings who are regularly excluded from school and/or who are under-achieving academically. Similarly, it may be helpful to screen children at risk in social care.

Clinical interview

The interview should always commence with current concerns as well as background information (including family, past psychiatric and medical history) and move on to obtain a detailed developmental and clinical history that assesses the onset, trajectory, persistence and pervasiveness of symptoms as this will assist with differentiating between ADHD, ASD and other comorbid conditions. A current mental state examination should always be included as this is helpful for indicating the presence of comorbid psychiatric conditions and the assessment of risk. If indicated, some individuals may require referral for development coordination disorder.

It is critical to consider the extent to which the individual's functioning is both age and developmentally appropriate. A child's chronological age relates to their date of birth, and it may differ substantially from their developmental age. Their developmental age is the age at which they function emotionally, physically, cognitively and socially. For example, a child may be 12 years of age, but developmentally, they display emotions or behaviours that make them seem much younger. Hence, it is important not to focus solely on a child's intellectual limitations or chronological age but to be mindful of a child's developmental limitations more broadly. For example, a child of 12 years may have an IQ that falls within normal limits, but their emotional and social functioning may be highly discrepant with other functioning and developmentally inappropriate. Hence, one has to consider the broader developmental functioning of the child.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents — diagnostic evaluation (KAS 1–3) states the pediatrician or other primary care clinician (PCC) should initiate an evaluation for any child or adolescent age 4 years to the 18th birthday with academic or behavioral problems and symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity; to diagnose ADHD, the PCC should determine that DSM-5 criteria have been met with impairment in more than 1 major setting and should also rule out any alternative cause; the evaluation should include a process to at least screen for comorbid emotional, behavioral, developmental, and physical conditions. These carry a Grade B, strong recommendation rating.

### ADHD in DSM-5: a field trial in a large, representative sample of 18-to 19-year-old adults [^1da0fa39]. Psychological Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Assessment of ADHD prevalence and exploration of the impact of individual diagnostic criteria on ADHD prevalence rates

According to full DSM-5 criteria, the prevalence of ADHD was 3.55% [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.98–4.12]. The prevalence of inattentive, hyperactive/impulsive and combined presentations was 1.65, 0.45 and 1.45% respectively. The effects on ADHD prevalence rates of using different symptom cut-off points for assigning a diagnosis are displayed in Table 2. This table also shows the impact on prevalence rates of sequentially applying the ADHD additional criteria. In general, the most significant decrease in ADHD prevalence was determined by age-at-onset criterion, which had a larger effect on prevalence rates than the symptom cut-off or the impairment criteria. Note that ADHD prevalence rates had overlapping CIs with four, five or six symptom cut-offs (Table 2). If severe (rather than at least moderate) clinical impairment was used as an ADHD additional criterion, the prevalence of ADHD would be 1.4% (95% CI 1.04–1.76%). The ADHD prevalence rate with at least six symptoms in any dimension was estimated to be 2.9% (95% CI 2.38–3.42%) in our sample (Table 2). Discounting the impact of the modification of age-at-onset criterion estimated at 0.1%, we would end up with a DSM-IV ADHD prevalence rate of about 2.8%. We also ran secondary analyses comparing the three groups (subjects without ADHD, ADHD cases based on both DSM-IV and DSM-5, and new ADHD cases based only on DSM-5 criteria) with regard to male/female ratio, impairment and co-morbidity. There are no differences between the two groups of cases on impairment (p = 0.73) and both groups differed from the subjects without ADHD (p < 0.001). Both groups of cases also presented similar male/female ratios (39.3% versus 40%) and rates of co-morbidity with anxiety disorders (37.1% and 40%). However, new cases identified only by DSM-5 had a higher prevalence of co-morbid mood disorders (16% and 7.7%).

### Systematic review and meta-analysis: screening tools for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^0e5a04d9]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the accuracies of a broad range of screening tools for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents, and to compare the diagnostic accuracy of tools between population-based and clinical/high-risk samples, and across reporters.

Method

MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and PubMed were searched up until February 20, 2020, with no language restrictions. Studies reporting diagnostic accuracy of a screening tool against a diagnosis of ADHD in children and adolescents < 18 years of age were eligible for inclusion. Meta-analyses were undertaken to provide pooled estimates of the area under the curve (AUC), and sensitivity and specificity of groups of measures.

Results

A total of 75 studies published between 1985 and 2021 reporting on 41 screening tools that were grouped into 4 categories (Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment [ASEBA], DSM-IV symptom scales, SDQ, and Other Scales) were retained. The pooled AUC for studies using a combined ADHD symptoms score was 0.82 (95% CI = 0.78–0.86), although this varied considerably across reporters (0.67–0.92) and populations (CI = 0.60–0.95). None of the measures met minimal standards for acceptable sensitivity (0.8) and specificity (0.8).

Conclusion

Most tools have excellent overall diagnostic accuracy as indicated by the AUC. However, a single measure completed by a single reporter is unlikely to have sufficient sensitivity and specificity for clinical use or population screening.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the severity of core symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in females and males [^392fa5c1]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 2.
Forest plot showing differences in inattention severity in males and females in the total sample (n = 48 – DuPaul et al. a and DuPaul b are different data from the same study).

Table 1.
Summary of findings for sex differences

Using these data, we conducted meta-analyses in three broad areas: (1) total sample data (three analyses), (2) rating scale data (six analyses), and (3) clinical interview diagnostic data (six analyses). Fifteen meta-analyses were conducted in total. The results report sex differences in the severity of symptoms of ADHD: (1) in the 'total sample' across the entire lifespan when aggregating rating scale and clinical diagnostic assessment data (52 studies); (2) in a 'rating scales sample' that we obtained by extracting the rating scale data sample (18 studies; 83.3% community-based studies), and (3) in a 'clinical diagnostic interview sample' which exclusively focused on studies employing clinical diagnostic assessment data in samples of child and adult study participants (33 studies; 57.6% in clinical settings).

As shown in Table 1, out of 15 meta-analyses, only three showed significant sex differences in Figs 3, 6, and 7. The most significant sex difference was found in the rating scale data for hyperactivity/impulsivity where male children exhibited significantly higher symptoms (z value = −4.62).

Meta-analyses of the total sample

For the initial analysis, no study was excluded based on any age, mode of assessment, or setting representing a sample that aggregated all data across the lifespan (i.e. including both rating scale and clinical diagnostic interview data). This was comprised of a total of 52 studies: n = 8451 male and n = 7304 female participants. The most common adult rating scales used in the studies were the Adult ADHD Rating Scale and the Wender Utah rating scale for adults. For children, the most common were the Conners' scales, Child Behavior Checklist, Barkley Current Symptoms Scale, and the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire. The most common clinical interviews used in the studies were reported to be based on DSM-IV and DSM-IV-TR criteria for adults and, for children, the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia and the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children.

### Attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in adults [^8076ae6e]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder involving functionally disruptive inattentive and/or hyperactive/impulsive behaviors, such as being easily distracted, regularly failing to follow through on tasks, being restless, or often interrupting others. ADHD diagnosed in childhood often persists into adulthood, with 14.6% of U.S. adults meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed., criteria for ADHD. When evaluating for adult ADHD, other mental disorders should be included in the differential diagnosis due to the substantial overlap of symptoms and ADHD concurrence with anxiety/stress, mood, personality, impulse control, and substance use disorders. An ADHD diagnosis requires a comprehensive clinical history and evaluation, patient symptom and function assessment (e.g. Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale, Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scales), and gathering of collateral information. Clinical guidelines recommend a subset of amphetamine and methylphenidate stimulants as first-line pharmacotherapy, which may be more effective when combined with psychotherapy. For adults unable to take stimulants or with concurrent anxiety/depression, options include atomoxetine, viloxazine, and bupropion. To monitor for patient misuse or diversion of stimulants, physicians should consider employing controlled substance agreements and prescription drug monitoring programs.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the severity of core symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in females and males [^5e77e102]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In 2012, Willcutt conducted a meta-analytic review of the literature published between 1994 and 2010 investigating the prevalence rates of ADHD subtypes in children and adults diagnosed using the DSM-IV criteria. Unlike the previous studies, the primary aim was to investigate prevalence rates and they were generally similar across the rating sources for children (parent, teacher, diagnostic procedure: 5.9–7.1%) and self-reporting in young adults (5%). The diagnostic outcomes, however, differed between the sexes. A significantly greater proportion of females than males met the diagnostic criteria for the inattentive subtype. In contrast, males were more likely than females to meet the diagnostic criteria for the combined type.

It has become clear that we need to develop better insights into the presentation and difficulties of ADHD in girls and women (Willcutt). Our understanding has been hampered, however, because the existing evidence predominantly draws on male samples (Gershon; Willcutt). It is unknown to what extent ADHD is missed or misdiagnosed in females. A key question is, does the presentation of ADHD symptoms differ between boys and girls in childhood and/or in their adulthood? A prevalence study does not directly answer this question, whereas a study investigating sex differences in the severity of symptoms is more informative because it provides a dimensional perspective rather than focusing on the outcomes of a categorical threshold (Kraemer, Noda, & O'Hara).

In the past decade, there have been substantial changes in the diagnostic nomenclature and this study conducts an updated and contemporary systematic review of the data reporting severity of ADHD symptoms which is not present in the current literature. The unique features of the present study are the reliance on more refined symptom criteria (using the DSM-IV [APA,], DSM-IV(TR) [APA,], and DSM-5 [APA,]), the separation of clinical diagnostic assessment data from rating scale data, and the inclusion of a broader age range of adults.

Given the exploratory nature of the study, a priori hypotheses were not formulated. Rather, we examined the following research question: Does the severity of ADHD symptoms differ between boys and girls in childhood (aged < 18) and/or in adulthood?

### Symptomatology of autism spectrum disorder in a population with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^ac2855d1]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Aim

Difficulties in neurocognition and social interaction are the most prominent causes of morbidity and long-term disability in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Symptoms of attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have also been extensively recognized in NF1. However, systematic evaluation of symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children with NF1 has been limited.

Method

We present a retrospective, cross-sectional study of the prevalence of symptoms of ASD and ADHD and their relationship in a consecutive series of 66 patients from our NF1 clinic. The Social Responsiveness Scale and the Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Parent Rating Scale were used to assess symptoms of ASD and ADHD.

Results

Sixty-six participants (42 males, 24 females) were included in this study. Mean age at assessment was 10 years 11 months (SD 5 y 4 mo). Forty percent of our NF1 sample had raised symptom levels reaching clinical significance on the Social Responsiveness Scale (T ≥ 60), and 14% reached levels consistent with those seen in children with ASDs (T ≥ 75). These raised levels were not explained by NF1 disease severity or externalizing/internalizing behavioral disorders. There was a statistically significant relationship between symptoms of ADHD and ASD (χ² = 9.11, df = 1, p = 0.003, φ = 0.56). Particularly salient were the relationships between attention and hyperactivity deficits, with impairments in social awareness and social motivation.

Interpretation

We found that symptoms of ASD in our NF1 population were raised, consistent with previous reports. Further characterization of the specific ASD symptoms and their impact on daily function is fundamental to the development and implementation of effective interventions in this population, which will probably include a combination of medical and behavioral approaches.

### Diagnostic controversies in adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [^10291c26]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

While it is increasingly recognized that attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) persists into adulthood, there is no consensus on diagnostic criteria for adult ADHD. In this article the authors describe and contrast competing approaches for diagnosis of adult ADHD used in clinical and research practice.

Method

The authors review the Wender Utah criteria, DSM criteria, and laboratory assessment strategies for adult ADHD. Advantages and disadvantages of each approach are described, and recommendations are made as a basis for clinical assessment and future research.

Results

Both the Wender Utah criteria and DSM-based approaches identify significantly impaired ADHD adults with neurocognitive, biological, and treatment response patterns similar to pediatric ADHD patients. The Wender Utah criteria established the need for retrospective childhood diagnosis and recognize developmental differences in adult symptom expression. The Wender Utah criteria fail to identify patients with predominantly inattentive symptoms, exclude some patients with significant comorbid psychopathology, and diverge significantly from the DSM conception of ADHD. The DSM criteria have never been validated in adults, do not include developmentally appropriate symptoms and thresholds for adults, and fail to identify some significantly impaired adults who are likely to benefit from treatment. There are insufficient scientific data to justify use of laboratory assessment measures, including neuropsychological tests and brain imaging, in diagnosing adult ADHD.

Conclusions

Adult ADHD remains a clinical diagnosis. Clinicians should be flexible in application of the current ADHD criteria to adults. Additional research is required to validate adult diagnostic criteria.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^dcfa8639]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) guideline conclusions state that evidence is clear with regard to the legitimacy of the diagnosis of ADHD and the appropriate diagnostic criteria and procedures required to establish a diagnosis, identify comorbid conditions, and effectively treat with both psychosocial and pharmacologic interventions. The steps required to sustain appropriate treatments and achieve successful long-term outcomes remain challenging, however. As noted, this clinical practice guideline is supported by 2 accompanying documents available in the Supplemental Information: the process of care algorithm (PoCA) and the article on systemic barriers to the care of children and adolescents with ADHD. Full implementation of the guideline's key action statements (KASs), the PoCA, and the recommendations to address barriers to care may require changes in office procedures and the identification of community resources. The page lists development of standardized and documented tools to help primary care providers identify comorbid conditions; development of effective electronic and Web-based systems to help gather information to diagnose and monitor children and adolescents with ADHD; improvements to systems for communicating with schools, mental health professionals, and other community agencies to provide effective collaborative care; development of more objective measures of performance to more objectively monitor aspects of severity, disability, or impairment; assessment of long-term outcomes for children in whom ADHD was first diagnosed at preschool ages; and identification and implementation of ideas to address the barriers that hamper the implementation of these guidelines and the PoCA.

### Prevalence of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder and intellectual disability among children with hydrocephalus [^80bdca06]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Little is known about the prevalence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children with hydrocephalus. In this study, the authors assessed the prevalence of ADHD and its association with clinical and demographic factors, including intellectual disability (ID), a potential factor that can confound the diagnosis of ADHD.

Methods

The authors conducted a cross-sectional study of children 6–12 years of age with hydrocephalus using parent telephone surveys. The Child and Adolescent Intellectual Disability Screening Questionnaire (CAIDS-Q) and the National Institute for Children's Health Quality (NICHQ) Vanderbilt Assessment Scale were used to screen for ID and ADHD, respectively. Among children without ID, the authors identified those with ADHD and calculated a prevalence estimate and 95% confidence interval (Wald method). Logistic regression analysis was conducted to compare children with ADHD with those without ADHD based on demographics, family income, parental educational, etiology of hydrocephalus, and primary treatment. As a secondary analysis, the authors compared subjects with ID with those without using the same variables. Multivariable analysis was used to identify factors with independent association with ADHD and ID.

Results

A total of 147 primary caregivers responded to the telephone questionnaire. Seventy-two children (49%) met the cutoff score for ID (CAIDS-Q). The presence of ID was significantly associated with lower family income (p < 0.001). Hydrocephalus etiology (p = 0.051) and initial treatment (p = 0.06) approached significance. Of children without ID (n = 75), 25 demonstrated a likely diagnosis of ADHD on the NICHQ, yielding a prevalence estimate of 0.33 (95% CI 0.22–0.44). No clinical or demographic variable showed significant association with ADHD.

Conclusions

These data indicate that the prevalence of ADHD among children with hydrocephalus (33%) is higher than among the general population (estimated prevalence in Alabama is 12.5%). ID is also common (49%). Routine screening for ADHD and ID in children with hydrocephalus may help to ensure that adequate resources are provided to optimize functional outcomes across development.

### Reliability and validity of a semi-structured DSM-based diagnostic interview module for the assessment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adult psychiatric outpatients [^6de46f1e]. Psychiatry Research (2016). Low credibility.

Despite growing recognition that the symptoms and functional impairments of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) persist into adulthood, only a few psychometrically sound diagnostic measures have been developed for the assessment of ADHD in adults, and none have been validated for use in a broad treatment-seeking psychiatric sample. The current study presents the reliability and validity of a semi-structured DSM-based diagnostic interview module for ADHD, which was administered to 1194 adults presenting to an outpatient psychiatric practice. The module showed excellent internal consistency and interrater reliability, good convergent and discriminant validity (as indexed by relatively high correlations with self-report measures of ADHD and ADHD-related constructs and little or no correlation with other, non-ADHD symptom domains), and good construct validity (as indexed by significantly higher rates of psychosocial impairment and self-reported family history of ADHD in individuals who meet criteria for an ADHD diagnosis). This instrument is thus a reliable and valid diagnostic tool for the detection of ADHD in adults presenting for psychiatric evaluation and treatment.

### Clinical utility and psychometric properties of tools for early detection of developmental concerns and disability in young children: a scoping review [^4aec764e]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

ADHD

ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder in which persistent inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity affect functioning. It begins in childhood, and features must be present before 12 years. For the inattentive presentation, at least six symptoms associated with inattention must be present such as difficulty with sustaining attention in tasks, not following through on instructions, difficulty with organizing tasks, or not paying attention to details and making careless mistakes. Diagnosis of the hyperactive/impulsive presentation requires at least five symptoms, such as fidgetiness, excessive talking, blurting out responses, restlessness, and difficulty sitting still. For all presentations, symptoms must be present across two or more settings. Symptoms must interfere with or reduce quality of functioning. Recent clinical practice guidelines on the diagnosis of ADHDhighlight the importance of comprehensive assessment. Therefore, all the tools discussed are best considered as screening measures. Whereas some are multi‐domain scales that include measures of attention and behaviour (e.g. the BASC‐3, the Conners Early Childhood Assessment [Conners EC], the CBCL, and the SDQ), others focus on the executive function challenges associated with ADHD (Behavior Rating Index of Executive Function–Preschool [BRIEF‐P], Brown Attention Deficit Disorder Symptom Assessment Scale [BADDS]/Brown Executive Function/Attention Scales).

### The World Health Organization adult ADHD self-report scale (ASRS): a short screening scale for use in the general population [^da979f39]. Psychological Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

A self-report screening scale of adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the World Health Organization (WHO) Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) was developed in conjunction with revision of the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). The current report presents data on concordance of the ASRS and of a short-form ASRS screener with blind clinical diagnoses in a community sample.

Method

The ASRS includes 18 questions about frequency of recent DSM-IV Criterion A symptoms of adult ADHD. The ASRS screener consists of six out of these 18 questions that were selected based on stepwise logistic regression to optimize concordance with the clinical classification. ASRS responses were compared to blind clinical ratings of DSM-IV adult ADHD in a sample of 154 respondents who previously participated in the US National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), oversampling those who reported childhood ADHD and adult persistence.

Results

Each ASRS symptom measure was significantly related to the comparable clinical symptom rating, but varied substantially in concordance (Cohen's kappa in the range 0.16–0.81). Optimal scoring to predict clinical syndrome classifications was to sum unweighted dichotomous responses across all 18 ASRS questions. However, because of the wide variation in symptom-level concordance, the unweighted six-question ASRS screener outperformed the unweighted 18-question ASRS in sensitivity (68.7% v. 56.3%), specificity (99.5% v. 98.3%), total classification accuracy (97.9% v. 96.2%), and kappa (0.76 v. 0.58).

Conclusions

Clinical calibration in larger samples might show that a weighted version of the 18-question ASRS outperforms the six-question ASRS screener. Until that time, however, the unweighted screener should be preferred to the full ASRS, both in community surveys and in clinical outreach and case-finding initiatives.

### Measuring impairment when diagnosing adolescent ADHD: differentiating problems due to ADHD versus other sources [^94f3a51e]. Psychiatry Research (2018). Low credibility.

The DSM-5 requires clinicians to link ADHD symptoms to clinically meaningful impairments in daily life functioning. Measuring impairment during ADHD assessments may be particularly challenging in adolescence, when ADHD is often not the sole source of a youth's difficulties. Existing impairment rating scales are criticized for not specifying ADHD as the source of impairment in their instructions, leading to potential problems with rating scale specificity. The current study utilized a within subjects design (N = 107) to compare parent report of impairment on two versions of a global impairment measure: one that specified ADHD as the source of impairment (Impairment Rating Scale-ADHD) and a standard version that did not (Impairment Rating Scale). On the standard family impairment item, parents endorsed greater impairment as compared to the IRS-ADHD. This finding was particularly pronounced when parents reported high levels of parenting stress. More severe ADHD symptoms were associated with greater concordance between the two versions. Findings indicate that adolescent family related impairments reported during ADHD assessments may be due to sources other than ADHD symptoms, such as developmental maladjustment. To prevent false positive diagnoses, symptom-specific wording may optimize impairment measures when assessing family functioning in diagnostic assessments for adolescents with ADHD.

### Attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^9d34819d]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2015). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a persistent neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 5% of children and adolescents and 2.5% of adults worldwide. Throughout an individual's lifetime, ADHD can increase the risk of other psychiatric disorders, educational and occupational failure, accidents, criminality, social disability and addictions. No single risk factor is necessary or sufficient to cause ADHD. In most cases ADHD arises from several genetic and environmental risk factors that each have a small individual effect and act together to increase susceptibility. The multifactorial causation of ADHD is consistent with the heterogeneity of the disorder, which is shown by its extensive psychiatric co-morbidity, its multiple domains of neurocognitive impairment and the wide range of structural and functional brain anomalies associated with it. The diagnosis of ADHD is reliable and valid when evaluated with standard criteria for psychiatric disorders. Rating scales and clinical interviews facilitate diagnosis and aid screening. The expression of symptoms varies as a function of patient developmental stage and social and academic contexts. Although there are no curative treatments for ADHD, evidenced-based treatments can markedly reduce its symptoms and associated impairments. For example, medications are efficacious and normally well tolerated, and various non-pharmacological approaches are also valuable. Ongoing clinical and neurobiological research holds the promise of advancing diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to ADHD.

### The adult ADHD self-report scale for screening for adult attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [^84a4f3bb]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Adult attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is underdiagnosed in the primary care setting despite 3% to 6% of adults having ADHD-like symptoms. The Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale-V1.1 (ASRS-V1.1) is a validated, 6-question screen for adult ADHD. Our purpose was to analyze this tool for evaluating patients in a busy primary care setting.

Methods

The ASRS-V1.1 was administered to patients in 8 busy primary care practices. All with a positive score and a random sample of those with a negative screening score were asked to complete the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale Self Report-Short Version. Each was administered within the clinic setting during the same session. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive/negative predictive values were calculated. Data were evaluated for site-specific differences.

Results

It took an average of 54.3 seconds (range, 22–252 seconds) to complete the ASRS-V1.1. There was an inconsistency-adjusted sensitivity of 1.0, a specificity of 0.71, a positive predictive value of 0.52, and a negative predictive value of 1.0. No site-specific differences were found.

Conclusions

Because of its ease of use, short time to administer, high sensitivity, and moderate specificity, the ASRS-V1.1 is an effective adult ADHD screening to guide further evaluations for ADHD.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurobehavioral disorder of childhood and can profoundly affect the academic achievement, well-being, and social interactions of children; the American Academy of Pediatrics first published clinical recommendations for the diagnosis and evaluation of ADHD in children in 2000; recommendations for treatment followed in 2001.

### Guidance for identification and treatment of individuals with attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder based upon expert consensus [^a0bb165c]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

For both conditions, uneven cognitive profiles are commonly seen which may complicate the determination of an individual's general intellectual abilities (i.e. the Full Scale IQ). In such cases, it is more informative to focus on the four individual intellectual sub-scales or indices that summarise the person's verbal abilities, performance abilities, working memory and processing speed. The inclusion of an intellectual assessment is particularly useful for both young people in school/further education and adults as it provides information about the individual's cognitive strengths and weaknesses, which in turn informs goals for treatment by indicating specific areas of cognitive weakness that can then be targeted with appropriate interventions in educational settings.

Neuropsychological testing is neither necessary nor sufficient for a diagnosis of ADHD; however, tests that assess executive dysfunction are helpful in determining deficits in higher order processing skills such as task switching, perseveration, planning, sequencing and organising information. Some have been specifically developed for use with an ADHD population and focus on assessing attention, impulsivity and vigilance in children and adults, e.g. Go-No-Go tasks, Stop tasks and continuous performance tests. Those most commonly used in clinical practice include the Conners' Continuous Performance Test, third edition (CPT 3 [age 8+]) and the QbTest. These tests are not specific markers of ADHD, but they augment clinical decision-making by providing useful information regarding a person's cognitive functioning. The assessor should be mindful of the limitations of formal tests and test environments raised above.

Outcome of the assessment

The outcome of the assessment should include a diagnostic formulation as well as an aetiological formulation that includes protective, predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating factors that inform a comprehensive care plan which considers of the needs of the individual and how these may be met across settings. This might include suggested pharmacological and/or psychological interventions to manage co-occurring difficulties such as anxiety or low mood, to minimise presenting risks, difficulties in social communication and behaviour and improve cognitive skills, study skills and social skills. For children and young people at school or in further education, a comprehensive formulation of current strengths and difficulties could be shared with educational establishments and other professionals involved in their care, should the young person consent. A comprehensive clinical assessment report should be copied to the patient and referrer. See Table 3 for a summary of suggested content.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^5c594e3b]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

ADHD — children with inattention or hyperactivity/impulsivity at a problem level: Teachers, parents, and child health professionals typically encounter children who demonstrate behaviors relating to activity level, impulsivity, and inattention but who do not fully meet DSM-5 criteria. When assessing these children, diagnostic criteria should be closely reviewed, which may require obtaining more information from other settings and sources, and also consider that these symptoms may suggest other problems that mimic ADHD. Behavioral interventions, such as PTBM, are often beneficial for children with hyperactive/impulsive behaviors who do not meet full diagnostic criteria for ADHD, and these programs do not require a specific diagnosis to be beneficial to the family. The DSM-PC was published in 1996 and has not been revised to be compatible with the DSM-5; therefore, the DSM-PC cannot be used as a definitive source for diagnostic codes related to ADHD and comorbid conditions, although it can be used conceptually as a resource for behavioral concerns.

### DSM-based ADHD rating scales | Eqipp.aap.org… [^78ea40a3]. eqipp.aap.org (2007). Low credibility.

DSM-based rating scales are designed to focus on ADHD symptoms to help determine the possible presence of core symptoms of ADHD as defined by DSM-5 criteria for ADHD. The AAP recommends the use of DSM-based ADHD rating scales when evaluating ADHD: DSM-based rating scales should be completed for 2 or more major settings. The rating scales may be completed by the parent or other family members, teachers, clinicians, or other professional observers who have opportunities to observe the child's behavior to help determine which ADHD symptoms and co-occurring conditions are present in the patient, in which environments, and over what time period. NOTE: Be aware that screening tools and rating scales are not diagnostic; they are instruments used to help clinicians identify the possible presence of a condition. Additional information/tests are required to confirm or rule out a diagnosis.

For purposes of this EQIPP course, some recommended age-specific rating scales/scoring interpretations include, but are not limited to, the following: ADHD Rating Scale IV – Preschool Version Vanderbilt Assessment Scale: ADHD Toolkit Parent-Informant Form Vanderbilt Assessment Scale, Follow-up: ADHD Toolkit Parent-Informant Form. Vanderbilt Assessment Scale: ADHD Toolkit Teacher-Informant Form Vanderbilt Assessment Scale, Follow-up: ADHD Toolkit Teacher-Informant Form ADHD Rating Scale–5, Home Version ADHD Rating Scale–5, School Version. Conner Rating Scales 6–18 years. Parent and Teacher Scales 8–18 years. Self-Report Scale. *Note: The fifth edition of the DSM-5 does not include significant changes to ADHD-related recommendations from the DSM-4 publication. Therefore, rating scales based on DSM-4 criteria are sufficient for purposes of this EQIPP quality improvement activity.

Notable changes from DSM-4 to DSM-5 include: 1) Permission now granted to diagnose ADHD and autistic spectrum disorder as coexisting diagnoses; 2) ADHD symptoms must be seen before age 12; and 3) adolescents age 17 may qualify for an ADHD diagnosis if 5 of 9 symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity are noted.

### Neurocognitive function in moderate-severe pediatric atopic dermatitis: a case-control study [^b3a6a06a]. Pediatric Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

Epidemiological studies have shown an increased prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children with atopic dermatitis (AD), but many of the features of ADHD may occur as a result of the poor sleep and itch distraction associated with AD.

Methods

A case-control study was performed in children aged 6–17 years with moderate/severe AD compared with age-/sex-matched healthy controls. Participants were screened for ADHD using Vanderbilt assessments.

Results

Seventeen patients with AD and 18 controls completed the study. Two children with AD (11.7%) and one control (5.56%) met screening criteria for ADHD via parent-completed Vanderbilt assessments; AD patients were not significantly more likely to screen positive for ADHD (P = 0.47), or comorbid behavior disorders (P = 0.23). However, AD patients were more likely than controls to exhibit ADHD-associated behaviors, most significantly inattention.

Conclusions

Our AD cohort did not have a significantly increased prevalence of ADHD. Certain neurocognitive symptoms are increased in children with moderate-to-severe AD compared to controls.

### Prevalence and assessment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in primary care settings [^7c5041c8]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Research literature relating to the prevalence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and co-occurring conditions in children from primary care settings and the general population is reviewed as the basis of the American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline for the assessment and diagnosis of ADHD. Epidemiologic studies revealed prevalence rates generally ranging from 4% to 12% in the general population of 6 to 12 year olds. Similar or slightly lower rates of ADHD were revealed in pediatric primary care settings. Other behavioral, emotional, and learning problems significantly co-occurred with ADHD. Also reviewed were rating scales and medical tests that could be employed in evaluating ADHD. The utility of using both parent- and teacher-completed rating scales that specifically assess symptoms of ADHD in the diagnostic process was supported. Recommendations were made regarding the assessment of children with suspected ADHD in the pediatric primary care setting.

### Investigating the validity of the strengths and difficulties questionnaire to assess ADHD in young adulthood [^f1044ea4]. Psychiatry Research (2021). Medium credibility.

We also investigated whether different cut-points are required to capture clinically relevant symptoms in young adulthood compared to younger ages. Current recommendations based on identifying the top 10% of the population suggest that in childhood and adolescence, self-rated scores of ≥ 7 capture those with high symptoms, with scores of 0–5 capturing those close to average. At age 25 years, our results suggest that lower cut-points are needed to capture clinically relevant symptoms, with scores of ≥ 5 achieving the best balance between sensitivity and specificity in identifying those meeting ADHD diagnostic criteria and a cut-point of ≥ 6 capturing 10% of our sample. These lower thresholds likely reflect the generally lower levels of ADHD symptoms in adulthood and is consistent with diagnostic criteria that require fewer symptoms to be present for an adult diagnosis to be made. While these cut-points performed well in identifying those meeting diagnostic criteria, this short screening tool captured a broader group of individuals, with the cut-point of ≥ 5 capturing 25% of the sample. For those aiming to identify a smaller proportion of their research samples, it may be preferential to select the top 10% (requiring a cut-point of ≥ 6 in this sample). Replication of these cut-points in different samples is an important area for future research.

### ADHD in DSM-5: a field trial in a large, representative sample of 18-to 19-year-old adults [^93e5e4a8]. Psychological Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

This strategy for assessing impairment was chosen to mimic approaches in clinical settings, in which clinicians tend to rely on the subject's general perception of impairment instead of on extensive evaluations of correlates of functioning. Thus, clinicians tend to assess ADHD impairment based on patient's perceptions (Rösler et al.). Although the threshold for defining impairment is subjective and individual, clinicians diagnose ADHD even in cases without substantial impairment. Thus, the threshold of self-report moderate impairment tends to be conservative.

Data analytic strategy: description of the sample

Sociodemographic and co-morbidity patterns were assessed both for DSM-5 ADHD cases and for subjects without ADHD. These two groups were compared using appropriate univariate tests.

Assessment of ADHD prevalence and exploration of the impact of individual diagnostic criteria on ADHD prevalence rates

The consequences of using different symptom thresholds on ADHD prevalence rates were explored by calculating the proportion of subjects that would be defined as ADHD cases according to several potential symptomatic cut-offs. We also applied the ADHD additional criteria consecutively to examine their individual impact on ADHD prevalence rates. For these prevalence assessments, we used data from the entire sample; the subjects who screened negative for ADHD (less than two out of six positive screening questions) were assumed to be negative for ADHD. Moreover, we estimated a comparison between DSM-IV and DSM-5 ADHD prevalence in our sample. This was an indirect comparison because we could not assess either ADHD symptoms with DSM-IV wording or the presence of impairment of symptoms before 7 years (as DSM-IV required). To derive an ADHD diagnosis according to DSM-IV criteria, we considered data from this sample using the 6/9 cut-point proposed by DSM-IV. To deal with age-of-onset criterion modification while avoiding the effect of recall bias in a cross-sectional study asking for the exact date of beginning ADHD symptoms, we relied on a previous study documenting an increase of 0.1% in ADHD prevalence rates with this DSM criterion B modification. It is important to note that this rate was obtained in a longitudinal assessment (Polanczyk et al.). Thus, we estimated the DSM-IV prevalence in this sample as the ADHD prevalence for the 6/9 cut-point with an additional 0.1% discount.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the severity of core symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in females and males [^abe2c6ee]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Much of the community data appears to be driven by information drawn from rating scales. Rating scales are helpful indicators that may be usefully applied to assess treatment outcomes; however, they are not diagnostic (Kooij et al; Young et al.). There is a variation in how well they map onto clinical diagnostic criteria; indeed, many are not compliant with current diagnostic nosology (e.g. DSM-5 criteria). They may overclassify ADHD symptoms as a 'current' presenting problem; the etiology of which may be another distinct and predominant clinical presentation (e.g. anxiety, bipolar, and/or personality disorders). For example, an empirical study of ADHD in male prisoners identified that rating scales are associated with both false-positive and false-negative symptoms (Young et al.), emphasizing the need for practitioners to move to a clinical diagnostic interview when borderline scores are obtained.

Importantly, a scoping search in PubMed limited to the papers published from May 28, 2021 to January 6, 2024 identified 30 studies. None of those consisted of relevant gender-disaggregated data on ADHD symptom severity. This aligns with our expectations as not examining characteristics of males and females separately is the gap in the literature that our meta-analysis has addressed. We therefore encourage future studies to prioritize gender-specific analyses in this area.

Another research direction that we suggest is acknowledging and exploring the effect of ethnicity. We expect that as more primary studies including reports of outcomes broken out by ethnicity are published, future systematic reviews and meta-analyses will be able to approach this research question, with the foundation laid by the present study of gender.

Strengths and limitations

The main advantages of the current meta-analysis study over the previous studies were the reliance on more refined symptom criteria (using the DSM-IV, DSM-IV-TR, and DSM-5), the separation of clinical diagnostic assessment and rating scale samples data, and the inclusion of both child and adult populations (the latter including a broader age range of adults). To provide a comprehensive picture of the issues we wished to investigate, we included a wide age range in our search which generated a substantial amount of data. The number of studies across the 15 meta-analyses shown in Table 1 ranged from 3 to 52 and the proportion of females v. males varied across the analysis. Some studies did not compare all three ADHD presentations (inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and combined).
