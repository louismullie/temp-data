## Question

What does a low T4 with a normal TSH indicate?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a low T4 (free or total) with a normal TSH result means and how to approach it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the basic physiology and why this pattern is discordant with primary hypothyroidism. Then, I should consider central hypothyroidism, including causes, key clues, and the appropriate work-up. Next, I need to evaluate non-thyroidal illness syndrome as a common non-glandular explanation. After that, I will rule out analytical or pre-analytical assay interference. I should then review medication effects that blunt TSH. Finally, I will synthesize the differential and propose management steps, all while verifying nuances like assay variability and the pitfalls of TSH-only strategies [^117NV6Ub] [^117AhYKn] [^111Wrp1V] [^111qDnSc].

> Let me first confirm the physiological implications of the pattern before drawing conclusions. In primary hypothyroidism, thyroid failure lowers T4 and elicits a compensatory TSH rise, so a low T4 with a "normal" or non-elevated TSH is biochemically discordant and suggests either central hypothyroidism due to pituitary or hypothalamic pathology, or a non-thyroidal illness state that suppresses both TRH/TSH and peripheral hormone levels, not a straightforward primary gland problem [^117NV6Ub] [^117AhYKn]. Wait, I briefly wondered whether mild primary hypothyroidism could present this way, but I should correct that thought: in primary disease the pituitary response should be elevated TSH, often above 10 mIU/L in overt cases, so a normal TSH here is inappropriately low for the degree of hypothyroxinemia and points away from isolated thyroid gland failure [^111Wrp1V].

> I will now examine central hypothyroidism as the leading pathological diagnosis in an outpatient with low T4 and an inappropriately normal or only mildly increased TSH. The definition hinges on insufficient TSH drive despite low circulating T4; TSH can read low, normal, or slightly elevated, but is inappropriate for the hypothyroid state, and symptoms may be subtle with coexisting pituitary deficits or mass effect signs on exam [^117NV6Ub] [^115BDX3H]. Let me consider causes methodically and not miss drug-induced etiologies or structural disease: pituitary adenomas, apoplexy, prior surgery or radiation, hypothalamic infiltrative disease, traumatic brain injury, and medications like mitotane can all produce this pattern and should be actively sought in history and exam [^115D3Sp4] [^1145Vhf8] [^116h7fEm].

> Next, I should review the central hypothyroidism work-up while being careful to exclude artifacts. I need to check a repeat TSH and FT4, ideally on a different platform to mitigate assay bias, and measure other pituitary axes, including morning cortisol, gonadotropins, prolactin, and IGF-1, with pituitary MRI if biochemical or clinical suspicion persists, recognizing that TRH stimulation is seldom needed today and that therapy is titrated to FT4 rather than TSH in confirmed cases [^117NV6Ub] [^117Uf2Sh]. Hold on, I should verify assay integrity and platform effects first because intermethod biases for FT4 are substantial and can meaningfully reclassify patients; repeating on a different immunoassay or using confirmatory indices can prevent misdiagnosis before proceeding to imaging or lifelong therapy [^111qDnSc] [^112jhSYv].

> But wait, what if this is a non-thyroidal illness syndrome rather than pituitary disease. I need to ensure the clinical context matches NTIS, which commonly occurs in acute or chronic systemic illness, trauma, or major surgery, suppresses hypothalamic TRH and TSH, reduces peripheral deiodination, and can progress from low T3 to low T4 with low or normal TSH; treatment targets the underlying illness, not the thyroid, and rT3 typically rises though it is rarely necessary to measure in practice [^117AhYKn] [^115woo8n]. I should double-check timing and trajectory because TSH can transiently rebound to 5–10 mIU/L during recovery, which can be mistaken for subclinical hypothyroidism but generally does not warrant levothyroxine in the absence of persistent evidence of true hypothyroidism [^113jZXuL] [^111Wrp1V].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without excluding analytical and pre-analytical interference, since discordant patterns can be artifactual. I need to check for high-dose biotin use, heterophile or human anti-mouse antibodies, and abnormal binding proteins, then repeat testing on an alternate platform, consider measuring total T4 and total T3 to cross-check free hormone results, and, when borderline, use a free T4 index to clarify equivocal FT4 immunoassay results [^112jhSYv] [^115jXbXK]. Let me verify assay comparability as large intermethod biases limit universal reference intervals and can change the apparent TSH–FT4 relationship, so method-specific interpretation and, if needed, re-testing are prudent steps before labeling someone as centrally hypothyroid [^111qDnSc] [^111T3dJh] [^1137Lksb].

> I should confirm whether medications are suppressing TSH secretion, creating an iatrogenic mimic of central hypothyroidism. Dopamine and dopamine agonists, high-dose glucocorticoids, and somatostatin analogs blunt TSH release and can yield low T4 with a low-normal TSH, and mitotane specifically can inhibit thyrotroph secretory capacity and produce low FT4 with non-elevated TSH on TRH testing [^117Vkavm] [^116h7fEm]. Let me review the full medication list and recent exposures carefully, and if feasible, repeat testing after washout to see whether the pattern normalizes before committing to imaging or treatment [^117Vkavm].

> I need to ensure I am not over-relying on a reflex TSH-only strategy because that can miss central hypothyroidism, particularly in patients with hypothalamic-pituitary disease where FT4 is decisive; indeed, combined first-line TSH and FT4 strategies increase detection at the cost of many false positives, and the incidence of newly detected central hypothyroidism in routine practice remains low, so pretest probability and clinical context must guide deeper evaluation [^115BDX3H] [^1151bGme]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought TSH-only screening would be sufficient in outpatients, but I should correct that assumption here: when central disease is plausible or results are discordant, FT4 must be measured and interpreted with method awareness to avoid missed diagnoses or misclassification [^111Wrp1V] [^111qDnSc].

> Let me consider special contexts where interpretation is tricky. After traumatic brain injury, early low T3 and T4 with normal TSH can reflect an NTIS-like state rather than fixed pituitary failure, and longitudinal reassessment is needed since chronic TSH deficiency emerges in a minority over months to years, so premature lifelong replacement should be avoided without confirmation [^1145Vhf8]. In pregnancy planning or pregnancy itself, isolated low FT4 with normal TSH diagnosed outside pregnancy warrants endocrinology input, and trimester-specific reference intervals and assay considerations are essential for accurate classification and appropriate management decisions [^115H9bnt] [^117N3s5r]. I should also confirm there is no need for routine rT3, as it adds little beyond clinical context and T3 in suspected NTIS and is largely reserved for rare disorders or research [^115woo8n].

> Now I should synthesize the differential and decide on actions in a structured way. In a stable outpatient with compatible features or pituitary risk factors, central hypothyroidism is likely and warrants repeat FT4/TSH on an alternate assay, evaluation of other pituitary hormones, and pituitary MRI, with levothyroxine titrated to normalize FT4 only after confirming the diagnosis and context, whereas in an acutely ill patient the same pattern most often reflects NTIS and should be observed through recovery without thyroid hormone therapy unless clear evidence of true hypothyroidism exists [^117NV6Ub] [^117AhYKn]. Let me first confirm there is no assay interference or drug effect by repeating testing on a different platform, reviewing supplements like biotin, and checking for TSH-suppressive medications, because resolving these issues can avert unnecessary imaging or treatment and clarify discordant results quickly [^112jhSYv] [^117Vkavm] [^111qDnSc].

> In summary, I need to ensure that a low T4 with a normal TSH is not mistaken for primary thyroid failure, since the pattern most often signals either central hypothyroidism or non-thyroidal illness, with assay or medication effects as frequent mimics; the safest, most evidence-based path is to confirm the abnormality on a second platform, anchor interpretation to clinical context, investigate the pituitary axis when suspicion is high, and avoid levothyroxine in acute illness unless clear hypothyroidism is established, titrating therapy to FT4 rather than TSH when central disease is confirmed [^117NV6Ub] [^117AhYKn] [^112jhSYv] [^117Uf2Sh]. Hold on, I should verify one last point: intermethod assay biases are common and can change categorization, so repeating and triangulating with total hormones or FT4 index when borderline is not optional but integral to getting this diagnosis right [^111qDnSc] [^1137Lksb].

Low free T4 with normal TSH most often reflects **central hypothyroidism** (pituitary or hypothalamic disease) [^117NV6Ub] [^115BDX3H] or **non-thyroidal illness syndrome** (NTIS) [^117AhYKn]. Less common causes include **assay interference** [^115jXbXK], medications (e.g. glucocorticoids, dopamine, somatostatin analogs) [^117Vkavm], or rare genetic defects [^117U2RLg]. Evaluation should include repeat TSH/FT4, FT3, pituitary hormones, and MRI, with consideration of assay interference [^112jhSYv]; treat central hypothyroidism with **levothyroxine** [^117NV6Ub] and manage NTIS by treating the underlying illness [^117AhYKn].

---

## Physiological mechanisms

### Central hypothyroidism

By definition, **central hypothyroidism** is characterized by insufficient TSH secretion from the pituitary or hypothalamus, leading to low FT4 with normal or mildly low TSH [^117NV6Ub]. The **pathophysiology** is inadequate pituitary or hypothalamic TSH production, resulting in reduced thyroid hormone production despite normal or mildly low TSH levels [^115BDX3H].

---

### Non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS)

By definition, **non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS)**, also known as euthyroid sick syndrome, occurs in critically ill patients and is characterized by low FT4, low T3, and normal or slightly decreased TSH [^117AhYKn]. The **pathophysiology** involves acute illness suppressing hypothalamic TRH, reducing TSH secretion and thyroid hormone production, which leads to low FT4 with normal or slightly decreased TSH [^117AhYKn] [^114Ub1fK].

---

## Clinical conditions associated with low FT4 and normal TSH

| **Clinical condition** | **Description** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|-|
| Central hypothyroidism | Insufficient TSH secretion from pituitary or hypothalamus [^117NV6Ub] [^115BDX3H] | Pituitary or hypothalamic dysfunction |
| Non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS) | Thyroid hormone abnormalities due to acute illness [^117AhYKn] | Suppression of hypothalamic TRH |
| Assay interference | Laboratory artifacts causing false low FT4 | Analytical interference |
| Medications (e.g. glucocorticoids, dopamine, somatostatin analogs) | Drugs suppressing TSH secretion [^117Vkavm] [^116h7fEm] | Pharmacological suppression |
| Genetic defects (e.g. thyroglobulin gene mutations) | Rare genetic disorders affecting thyroid hormone synthesis | Genetic mutations |

---

## Diagnostic approach

### Initial evaluation

Begin with **repeat testing** to confirm low FT4 with normal TSH and to exclude laboratory error, and perform a **clinical assessment** for symptoms of hypothyroidism, pituitary dysfunction, or acute illness [^114Ub1fK] [^111Wrp1V].

---

### Laboratory investigations

- **Free T3 measurement** — Assess FT3 levels to differentiate between central hypothyroidism and NTIS [^117AhYKn] [^115woo8n].

- **Pituitary hormone evaluation** — Measure other pituitary hormones (ACTH, cortisol, prolactin, LH, FSH, GH) to identify multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies [^117NV6Ub].

- **Assay interference** — Consider analytical interference, especially if clinical findings do not match laboratory results [^112jhSYv] [^111qDnSc].

---

### Imaging studies

Obtain a **pituitary MRI** to identify pituitary or hypothalamic lesions in suspected central hypothyroidism [^117NV6Ub].

---

## Clinical implications and management

### Central hypothyroidism

Clinical implications include fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and other hypothyroid symptoms; management involves **levothyroxine replacement therapy**, with monitoring of FT4 levels to guide dosage adjustments [^117NV6Ub] [^117Uf2Sh].

---

### Non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS)

In **non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS)**, the **clinical implications** relate to acute illness severity and prognosis [^117AhYKn]; **management** focuses on treating the underlying illness, and thyroid hormone replacement is generally not recommended unless persistent hypothyroidism is confirmed.

---

### Assay interference and medications

For assay interference and medication effects, the **clinical implications** are that falsely low FT4 can lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment; **management** involves identifying and addressing the underlying cause and avoiding unnecessary thyroid hormone replacement [^112jhSYv] [^117Vkavm].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

- **Central hypothyroidism** — Prognosis depends on underlying pituitary or hypothalamic disease; lifelong hormone replacement may be required [^117U2RLg].

- **NTIS** — Prognosis depends on severity of underlying illness; thyroid hormone abnormalities typically resolve with recovery [^117AhYKn].

- **Assay interference**: Prognosis is excellent once interference is identified and corrected [^115jXbXK].

---

Low FT4 with normal TSH is most commonly due to **central hypothyroidism** or **NTIS**, with less common causes including assay interference, medications, and genetic defects. A **structured diagnostic approach** — including repeat testing, clinical assessment, laboratory investigations, and imaging — is essential for accurate diagnosis and management [^114Ub1fK] [^111Wrp1V].

## References

### Thyroid function in critically ill patients [^117AhYKn]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) typically present with decreased concentrations of plasma tri-iodothyronine, low thyroxine, and normal range or slightly decreased concentration of thyroid-stimulating hormone. This ensemble of changes is collectively known as non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS). The extent of NTIS is associated with prognosis, but no proof exists for causality of this association. Initially, NTIS is a consequence of the acute phase response to systemic illness and macronutrient restriction, which might be beneficial.

Pathogenesis of NTIS in long-term critical illness is more complex and includes suppression of hypothalamic thyrotropin-releasing hormone, accounting for persistently reduced secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone despite low plasma thyroid hormone. In some cases, distinguishing between NTIS and severe hypothyroidism, which is a rare primary cause for admission to the ICU, can be difficult. Infusion of hypothalamic-releasing factors can reactivate the thyroid axis in patients with NTIS, inducing an anabolic response. Whether this approach has a clinical benefit in terms of outcome is unknown.

In this series paper, we discuss diagnostic aspects, pathogenesis, and implications of NTIS as well as its distinction from severe, primary thyroid disorders in patients in the ICU.

Methods to Detect Analytical Interference in Assays or Diagnose Entities

The ability to detect assay interference and estimate the true concentration of circulating thyroid hormones (THs) or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) depends on additional methods available in the clinical laboratory. Some tests can be performed in a general laboratory, while others are best conducted in a specialist reference laboratory. As even the simple methods described cannot be used on every sample, interpreting results in conjunction with the clinical context (e.g. discordance between thyroid function tests (TFTs) and the clinical status of the patient) or knowledge of laboratory systems (e.g. an unexpected change in TFT pattern compared with previous measurements) is invaluable.

Grossly discordant, widely variable, or extremely deranged results generally raise suspicion of interference. Unhelpfully, more subtle interference, which causes plausible biochemical patterns, can lead to diagnostic confusion and possibly unnecessary further investigation or intervention. Furthermore, in some situations, the presence of assay interference precludes accurate estimation of true TSH or TH values, requiring management of patients using clinical thyroid status rather than laboratory measurements.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for central hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to thyroid function tests, the ETA 2018 guidelines recommend suspecting CeH in patients with low serum concentrations of free T4 and slightly elevated TSH (< 10 mU/L, or inappropriately lower than expected on the basis of the hypothyroid state).

### Hypothyroidism: Etiology, diagnosis, and management [^117Vkavm]. The Medical Clinics of North America (2012). High credibility.

Hypothyroidism can be caused by several factors, including:

- **Autoimmune and inflammatory disorders**: Hashimoto's thyroiditis, autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome, sarcoidosis, Riedel's thyroiditis
- **Surgical and treatment-related causes**: Thyroidectomy, radioactive iodine ablation
- **Endocrine and glandular disorders**: Hypopituitarism, central hypothyroidism
- **Thyroiditis types**: Subacute thyroiditis, postpartum thyroiditis
- **Nutritional and metabolic conditions**: Iodine deficiency, cystinosis
- **Genetic and congenital factors**: Congenital hypothyroidism
- **Systemic diseases**: Hemochromatosis

In addition, hypothyroidism can be induced by medications such as:

- **Cancer therapies and immunomodulators**: Tivozanib, sorafenib, nivolumab, bexarotene, avelumab, atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, vandetanib, axitinib, lanreotide, cosibelimab, imatinib, regorafenib, everolimus, ipilimumab
- **Antithyroid drugs**: Propylthiouracil, methimazole
- **Mood stabilizers and anticonvulsants**: Lithium carbonate, divalproex DR, divalproex ER, lamotrigine, lamotrigine XR
- **Psychotropic drugs**: Quetiapine, venlafaxine, clomipramine, citalopram, paroxetine hydrochloride, sertraline, imipramine
- **Cardiovascular drugs**: Amiodarone, dronedarone
- **Others**: Potassium iodide, dopamine, pamidronate, dexlansoprazole DR, rifampin, glatiramer, lenvatinib, pazopanib, ponatinib, lenalidomide, bosutinib, pomalidomide, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole

This ensures a comprehensive overview of potential causes and agents associated with hypothyroidism while maintaining clarity and organization.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112JY1Hu]. Thyroid (2020). Low credibility.

We believe this is the first systematic review studying TSH and thyroid hormone associations with various clinical parameters. The results indicate that, contrary to the paradigm, thyroid hormone levels are associated more strongly with clinical parameters than TSH levels. Any relationship of clinical parameters with TSH levels can be explained by the strong population relationship between thyroid hormone levels and TSH levels, such that TSH levels are merely indirect measures of thyroid hormone levels.

In our sample, we found no indication of, or reference to, any work that suggested that TSH levels consistently indicate thyroid status of any organ or tissue more strongly than thyroid hormone levels.

As our goal was not to estimate the effect size for one treatment, our meta-analysis methodology differed from some other meta-analysis methodologies in that we did not use a weighted technique or pool all original patient data. In addition, it would not have been appropriate to combine all of these factors by using such meta-analysis methodology, as our analysis encompassed multiple studies covering various clinical outcomes, using different methodologies, different assays, and statistical methods.

Theoretically, one could use such other methodology to do a meta-analysis of each clinical parameter, but these individual meta-analyses would still need to be combined by using a method akin to ours (i.e. summing the meta-analyses in some way) to determine whether levels of thyroid hormones or TSH are more likely to be associated in general with clinical parameters.

### Circadian and circannual rhythms in thyroid hormones: Determining the TSH and free T4 reference intervals based upon time of day, age, and sex [^113cx1qj]. Thyroid (2015). Low credibility.

Establishing the reference interval for thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroxine (T4) is clinically important because several disease states have been linked to alterations in TSH and free T4 concentrations within the 95% confidence interval for normal thyroid hormone values. Age, sex, time of day, and ethnicity are known to affect circulating levels of TSH and free T4 but have not been used to establish reference intervals. The purpose of this study was to define the reference interval for TSH and free T4, considering age, sex, ethnicity, and circadian and circannual variability.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective analysis of 465,593 TSH and 112,994 free T4 measurements from subjects aged 1–104 years with no thyroid disease using a single TSH and free T4 immunoassay method. We calculated the boundaries for the central 95% of patient values, taking into account the hour of the day, day of the year, sex, and age.

- **Results**: Females had significantly higher TSH and free T4 levels than males; the magnitude of these differences did not exceed 0.1 mIU/L or 0.1 ng/dL, respectively. Although the 2.5% TSH reference interval remains constant throughout the day, date, and age ranges, the upper limit (97.5%) of the TSH reference interval increases from 6.45 to 7.55 mIU/L with age, primarily due to a progressive increase in the amplitude of the nocturnal TSH surge. Additionally, significant ethnic differences in TSH circadian periodicity occur between African American, Pacific Island, and Caucasian populations.

- **Conclusions**: The reference interval for TSH varies significantly based on these factors.

### The clinical significance of subclinical thyroid dysfunction [^1151xyer]. Endocrine Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease (SCTD) is defined as having serum free T(4) and free T(3) levels within their respective reference ranges alongside abnormal serum TSH levels. SCTD is increasingly diagnosed in clinical practice among young, middle-aged, and elderly populations. However, its clinical significance is widely debated. Subclinical hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can have repercussions on the cardiovascular system, bone, and other organs and systems. Despite the potential risk of progression to overt disease, the treatment and management of SCTD, as well as population screening, are controversial. There is no consensus on the thyroid hormone and thyrotropin cutoff values at which treatment should be considered. Opinions vary regarding tissue effects, symptoms, signs, and cardiovascular risk.

In this review, we critically analyze data on the prevalence and progression of SCTD, its tissue effects, and its prognostic implications. We also examine the mechanisms underlying tissue alterations in SCTD and the impact of replacement therapy on progression and tissue parameters. Finally, we address whether there is a need to treat slight thyroid hormone deficiency or excess, considering the patient's age.

### Subclinical thyroid disorders: significance and clinical impact [^115tf2US]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid diseases are characterized by abnormal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels while maintaining normal thyroid hormone concentrations. The diagnosis of these conditions hinges on defining the 'normal' euthyroid TSH range. In this review, arguments for and against lowering the upper limit of TSH are summarized. Although subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism are frequently encountered, their long-term consequences are subject to debate due to conflicting results from many observational studies. The causes, effects, and outcomes of treatment for both subclinical diseases are described, and the direction of future research in these conditions is outlined.

### Thyroid hormonal status among children with obesity [^113Fes6V]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

It is presumed that free T4 and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are related to obesity, but the findings are inconsistent. In this study, we evaluated T4 and TSH concentrations between normal children and those with obesity, and explored possible correlations between body mass index (BMI) and these markers.

- **Methods**: In this prospective study, 190 children who were overweight and obese and 133 children without obesity of the same age and sex were evaluated. Thyroid function tests (TSH, total T4, free T4, and free T3) were measured in all subjects in both groups. Thyroid antibodies (thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin) were determined among those with elevated TSH levels.

- **Results**: Levels of TSH and total T4 were significantly higher in children with obesity compared with the control group. Subclinical hypothyroidism was significantly higher in children with obesity (14.7%) compared with normal subjects (6.8%, p = 0.02). Among children with obesity and increased TSH levels, 10.7% had positive thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies. There was a significantly positive correlation between BMI z score and TSH level (r = 0.198, p < 0.001) and T4 level (r = 0.18, p = 0.001).

- **Conclusion**: TSH and total T4 levels are increased in children who are overweight or obese and are a common finding in these children. However, the incidence of thyroid antibodies is low in these patients and cannot be accounted for by thyroid autoimmunity. Due to these findings, it is possible that increased TSH and total T4 levels are a consequence of obesity and could be reduced by decreasing weight.

### The thyroid — too much and too little across the ages. The consequences of subclinical thyroid dysfunction [^112BNBRM]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Mild thyroid dysfunction is common and more prevalent than overt hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. Subclinical (mild) thyroid dysfunction is a biochemical entity characterized by an abnormality of serum TSH associated with normal serum thyroid hormone concentrations. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is thus defined as low or suppressed serum TSH with normal serum-free T4 and T3, while subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as raised serum TSH with normal circulating T4. These biochemical abnormalities are part of a much wider spectrum of thyroid dysfunction, including overt hyperthyroidism and overt hypothyroidism, but they do not always indicate underlying thyroid disease.

There is much debate about the significance of mild abnormalities of thyroid function in terms of symptoms and potential associations with long-term morbidity and mortality. This debate extends to whether screening for these abnormalities is necessary, and once identified, whether treatment or monitoring is required, and if so, how it should be approached. Our knowledge base has increased significantly in recent years, primarily because studies of large cohorts have begun to define the epidemiology and associations of mild thyroid dysfunction, including short-term and long-term outcomes. Additionally, a small but increasing number of randomized-controlled intervention studies have been reported. However, there is still much to learn about these disorders and, given their prevalence, their impact on health.

### TSH and FT4 reference interval recommendations and prevalence of gestational thyroid dysfunction: Quantification of current diagnostic approaches [^113gSBLf]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend the use of population- and trimester-specific thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) reference intervals (RIs) in pregnancy. Since these are often unavailable, clinicians frequently rely on alternative diagnostic strategies. We sought to quantify the diagnostic consequences of these recommendations.

- **Methods**: We included cohorts participating in the Consortium on Thyroid and Pregnancy. Different approaches were used to define RIs: a TSH fixed upper limit of 4.0 mU/L (fixed limit approach), a fixed subtraction from the upper limit for TSH of 0.5 mU/L (subtraction approach), and using nonpregnancy RIs. Outcome measures were sensitivity and false discovery rate (FDR) of women for whom levothyroxine treatment was indicated and those for whom treatment would be considered according to international guidelines.

- **Results**: The study population comprised 52,496 participants from 18 cohorts. Compared with the use of trimester-specific RIs, alternative approaches had a low sensitivity (0.63–0.82) and high FDR (0.11–0.35) to detect women with a treatment indication or consideration. Sensitivity and FDR to detect a treatment indication in the first trimester were similar between the fixed limit, subtraction, and nonpregnancy approach (0.77–0.11 vs. 0.74–0.16 vs. 0.60–0.11). The diagnostic performance to detect overt hypothyroidism, isolated hypothyroxinemia, and (sub)clinical hyperthyroidism mainly varied between FT4 RI approaches, while the diagnostic performance to detect subclinical hypothyroidism varied between the applied TSH RI approach.

### Low serum free thyroxine level in a girl with McCune-Albright syndrome [^116jrX4g]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

A 17-year-old girl with McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) was suspected of having central hypothyroidism based on an inappropriately normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and low free thyroxine (fT4). She was clinically euthyroid, and her pituitary appeared normal on MRI. Treatment of hypothyroidism with levothyroxine resulted in suppression of TSH with a low fT4 and high free triiodothyronine (fT3) concentration; hence, iatrogenic hyperthyroidism was diagnosed. After discontinuation of levothyroxine, the TSH and fT3 normalized, while fT4 remained low. Increased conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) can be part of MAS. Therefore, fT3 and fT4 should both be measured when evaluating thyroid function in patients with MAS.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1155cNLx]. Thyroid (2020). Low credibility.

FT4 is not the active thyroid hormone at the cellular nuclear level. The strong relationships of parameters, especially atrial fibrillation (risk increased up to 9× across the normal reference range), with levels of FT4 indicate that the active intracellular triiodothyronine, generated by thyroid hormone transporters and deiodinases, appears to be at least in the heart, proportional to circulating FT4. Any discrepancy, indicating local regulation of thyroid effect, may be more prominent in more severe pathophysiological circumstances, and therefore more relevant in conditions such as frailty, death, and metabolic disturbance.

Our results do not imply that no information can be gleaned from the presence of an abnormal TSH level. In the presence of normal thyroid hormone levels, such TSH levels indicate that the thyroid gland physiology is abnormal. However, for the function of other tissues and organs, the TSH level required to maintain a given level of thyroid hormones appears generally not to be relevant.

It remains possible that additional analyses might find that TSH levels provide an additional signal to FT4 levels in some populations for certain conditions. It has been suggested that TSH itself may have physiological effects apart from the stimulation of thyroid hormone levels, and such effects, rather than reflecting thyroid status, might explain such a TSH signal. Empirically, the evidence suggests that any of these TSH effects are small.

The association of thyroid hormone, particularly FT4 levels, rather than TSH, underscores the complexity of thyroid function regulation and its systemic impact.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): An American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^116uLLpr]. Thyroid (2023). Low credibility.

Serum TSH concentration is the single best biomarker to confirm a diagnosis and also the magnitude of primary thyroid disease as a consequence of the log-linear TSH–fT4 relationship. Although not necessary for the diagnosis of primary disease, T4 (and for specific constellations T3) measurements are often added when TSH values fall outside the reference interval. This allows classification of thyroid disease into overt or subclinical and can direct therapeutic options accordingly (see "TSH and Thyroid Hormone Measurement: Clinical Algorithm" in Technical Supplementary Fig. S1).

TH measurement is also required to complement TSH measurement in several clinical situations, such as pregnancy, inter-illness when TSH can be suppressed (the nonthyroidal illness syndrome), and the initial treatment of hypo- or hyperthyroidism. The response of the pituitary-thyroid axis can be delayed following a change in thyroid status.

While the term "thyroid function test" is commonly used, it is only relevant to the untreated patient. This term describes TSH and TH tests even though determinations of these parameters are often used to monitor hypothyroid patients on levo-T4 therapy with no innate thyroid function, patients with hypothalamic or pituitary disease (secondary hypothyroidism), or patients taking medications that affect the pituitary-thyroid axis.

### Mitotane treatment in patients with adrenocortical cancer causes central hypothyroidism [^116h7fEm]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Mitotane, a steroidogenesis inhibitor with adrenolytic properties, is used to treat adrenocortical cancer (ACC) and can affect thyroid function. A reduction in FT4 levels with normal FT3 and TSH has been described in these patients. Using an in vitro murine model, it has been shown that the secretory capacity of thyrotrophic cells is inhibited by mitotane.

- **Objective**: To investigate the pathogenesis of thyroid abnormalities in mitotane-treated patients with ACC.

- **Patients and methods**: In five female patients with ACC (median age 47; range 31–65) treated with mitotane (dosage 1.5 g/day; range 1.0–3.0), we analyzed the pattern of TSH and thyroid function indices (FT4, FT3, and FT3/FT4 ratio) compared to an age- and gender-matched control group. The in vivo secretory activity of the thyrotrophic cells was evaluated using a standard TRH test (200 μg), and the response was compared to both a group of age-matched female controls (n = 10) and central hypothyroid patients (n = 10).

- **Results**: Basal TSH (median 1.54 mU/l; range 1.20–2.17) was normal and scattered around our median reference value. FT3 levels (median 3.80 pmol/l; range 3.30–4.29) were normal but below the median reference value of 4.37 pmol/l. FT4 levels were below the normal range in all patients (median 8.40 pmol/l; range 7.6–9.9). The FT3/FT4 ratio was in the upper range in four patients and higher than normal in one patient. A blunted TSH response to TRH was observed in mitotane-treated patients. ΔTSH (absolute TSH response, peak TSH minus basal TSH) was 3.65 (range 3.53–5.26), 12.37 (range 7.55–19.97), and 1.32 mU/l (range 0.52–4.66).

### Central hypothyroidism - a neglected thyroid disorder [^115BDX3H]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2017). Low credibility.

Central hypothyroidism is a rare and heterogeneous disorder characterized by a defect in thyroid hormone secretion in an otherwise normal thyroid gland due to insufficient stimulation by TSH. This disease results from the abnormal function of the pituitary gland, the hypothalamus, or both. Moreover, central hypothyroidism can be isolated or combined with other pituitary hormone deficiencies, which are mostly acquired and rarely congenital.

The clinical manifestations of central hypothyroidism are usually milder than those observed in primary hypothyroidism. Obtaining a positive diagnosis for central hypothyroidism can be difficult from both a clinical and a biochemical perspective. Diagnosis is based on low circulating levels of free T4 in the presence of low to normal TSH concentrations.

- **Complications in diagnosis**: The correct diagnosis of both acquired (also termed sporadic) and congenital (also termed genetic) central hypothyroidism can be hindered by:
	- Methodological interference in free T4 or TSH measurements
	- Routine utilization of total T4 or T3 measurements
	- Systemic illness characterized by low levels of free T4 and normal TSH concentrations
	- Use of the sole TSH-reflex strategy, which involves measuring only the level of TSH without free T4 when TSH levels are in the normal range
	- Diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism based on TSH analysis without the concomitant measurement of serum levels of T4

In this review, we discuss the knowledge of the causes of central hypothyroidism, emphasizing possible pitfalls.

Quality assessment of analytical methods for TSH and TH

While the studies from the C-STFT date from 2017, information about accuracy and quality of fT4 and TSH assays is very limited. Some information can be obtained from accuracy-based external quality assessment/proficiency testing programs. Additional information can be derived from outpatient data (e.g. the Noklus Percentiler) or from anonymized electronic patient records. More research using different data sources is needed to monitor the accuracy of thyroid function tests.

A prerequisite for valid quality assessment is the commutability of the materials used. This means that the materials used for quality assessment should behave exactly as any patient sample in any given assay. Commercially available proficiency testing materials and quality control samples rarely replicate clinically relevant matrices and their variability. This has been demonstrated in a study for TSH reference materials, comparing TSH extracted from human pituitary tissue with recombinantly expressed (glycoengineered) TSH, both of which do not precisely match the sialylated TSH of hypothyroid patients.

Similarly, fT4 reference material matrices are distinct from those of the serum or plasma of patients with nonthyroidal illness, disturbed lipid metabolism, or renal disease. Differences in matrix composition may require normalization procedures, which will limit within- or between-comparability of test results.

The continuing use of non-SI units (e.g. ng/dL) in clinical practice instead of correct SI terminology (mol/L) frequently creates discrepancies in test interpretation.

### Thyroid function testing in outpatients: Are both sensitive thyrotropin (sTSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) necessary [^112Yg4d1]. Family Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Despite improvements in thyroid function testing assays, the appropriate use of these commonly ordered tests to detect thyroid dysfunction remains controversial. This study investigated whether a normal sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (sTSH) test alone is sufficient to rule out thyroid dysfunction in outpatients.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective analysis of initial sTSH and free thyroxine index (FT4) tests ordered during a 26-month period. Test results were classified as concordant if both the sTSH and FT4 indicated the same findings (i.e. euthyroid, hyperthyroid, or hypothyroid). The results were classified as discordant if the sTSH and FT4 did not indicate the same findings.

- **Results**: There were 1,392 paired sTSH and FT4 results. Of 1,340 results classified as concordant (96.2%), 1,187 specimens were consistent with euthyroidism, 41 with hyperthyroidism, and 112 with hypothyroidism. Of the remaining 52 (3.8%) discordant results, 47 met the definition of subclinical thyroid dysfunction. Excluding these 47 results yielded a concordance rate of 99.6%. Of the 1,192 normal sTSH results, FT4 was low in two and high in three. If FT4 tests had not been ordered on the 1,192 specimens with normal sTSH levels, the savings over the study period would have been more than $3,360.

- **Conclusions**: If the sTSH is normal, the likelihood of an abnormal FT4 is very small. sTSH alone is adequate to screen outpatients for thyroid dysfunction. Limiting FT4 tests to those with abnormal sTSH results will result in cost savings.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): An American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^115woo8n]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Reverse T3 measurements: Unlike the active T4 metabolite T3, rT3 is an inactive metabolite of T4 as it does not bind or compete with T3 at the T3 receptor. Measurement of rT3 is widely cited in the lay press as a potential marker to guide T4 or T3 therapy; however, there is currently no evidence to support this application. Serum rT3 typically rises as T3 falls during nonthyroidal illness; consequently, measurement of rT3 adds little to this diagnosis unless nonthyroidal illness is confounding the diagnosis of central hypothyroidism.

However, as rT3 assays are not widely available, measurement of T3 is more practical, cheaper, and as effective as measuring rT3 if nonthyroidal illness syndrome is suspected. Other uses of rT3 analysis and the calculation of the serum rT3/T3 ratio are confined to the diagnosis of rare genetic thyroid conditions, and the diagnosis of the rare consumptive hypothyroidism syndrome due to the overexpression of deiodinase enzyme 3. Except for these three uncommon situations, there is no need to measure rT3 in routine clinical practice.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^111yC7gv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

True biochemical hyperthyroidism with nonsuppressed TSH is a complex clinical condition.

Genuinely raised (free) T4 levels can result from thyroxine therapy that involves poor compliance. Variable compliance with T4 therapy in hypothyroidism can lead to a biochemical pattern of normal or elevated FT4 and raised TSH concentrations. In such cases, an increase in thyroxine dosage to a supraphysiological level may normalize TSH levels but be associated with elevated circulating thyroid hormones (THs). This could suggest underlying resistance to thyroid hormone beta (RTHβ). The differentiation between this situation and the rare coincidence of RTHβ with autoimmune hypothyroidism is discussed further below.

Separately, it is recognized that some hypothyroid patients, compliant with thyroxine therapy in physiological doses, may exhibit raised circulating FT4 but normal FT3 and TSH concentrations. This phenomenon may be due to diminished activity of type 2 deiodinase, thereby reducing the conversion of T4 to T3, which inhibits pituitary TSH secretion.

Over 25 human proteins, including the thyroid deiodinase enzymes, contain the amino acid selenocysteine (Sec). The incorporation of Sec into selenoproteins during translation depends on a unique cellular pathway, which includes its own transfer RNA (Sec-tRNA [Ser]Sec, encoded by TRU-TCA1–1) and a protein (SECIS binding protein 2, encoded by SECISBP2) that binds a specific sequence (selenium cysteine insertion sequence [SECIS]) located in the messenger RNA.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: Clinical applications [^111trvZ4]. JAMA (2004). Low credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few, if any, clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations.

Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established. Treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L.

This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through five case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology position statement on thyroid dysfunction case finding [^113SKFsA]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can be readily diagnosed and treated in a safe, cost-effective manner. Professional organizations have provided guidance on when to employ thyroid-stimulating hormone testing for detecting thyroid dysfunction. Most recently, the United States Preventive Services Task Force did not endorse screening for thyroid dysfunction based on a lack of proven benefit and the potential harm of treating those with thyroid dysfunction, which is mostly subclinical disease. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) is concerned that this may discourage physicians from testing for thyroid dysfunction when clinically appropriate. Given the lack of specificity of thyroid-associated symptoms, the appropriate diagnosis of thyroid disease requires biochemical confirmation.

The Thyroid Scientific Committee of the AACE has produced this white paper to highlight the important difference between screening and case-based testing in clinical medicine practice. We recommend that thyroid dysfunction be frequently considered as a potential etiology for many of the nonspecific complaints that physicians encounter daily. The application and success of safe and effective interventions depend on an accurate diagnosis. We, therefore, advocate for an aggressive case-finding approach, based on identifying those most likely to have thyroid disease that will benefit from its treatment.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111C2vCG]. Thyroid (2020). Low credibility.

We, therefore, aimed at determining whether or not a systematic review of the literature might indicate the relative merits of thyroid hormone levels and TSH levels, in terms of associations with a broad range of clinical parameters. Because of the strong negative population correlation between free thyroxine (fT4) and TSH, we expected to find associations between both TSH and fT4 levels and the clinical features of thyroid dysfunction.

We further reasoned that if the clinical features were associated better with TSH levels, the rationale for thyroid function testing, and the consequent clinical and research classifications and practices would be supported. However, if the clinical features were associated better with thyroid hormone levels, these classifications and practices would warrant review. In this latter circumstance, the previously noted associations of clinical features with TSH levels could be attributed to the aforementioned strong negative population correlation between fT4 and TSH.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116gv3zG]. Thyroid (2020). Low credibility.

This work addressed diagnosis alone. Extrapolation of our findings appears logical, and there is no apparent a priori reason as to why TSH levels should be preferred over thyroid hormone levels in the context of monitoring thyroid treatments. Randomized trials might, nevertheless, reveal that additional considerations apply in these circumstances. Though there was no suggestion in the studies we examined of a difference with individuals on thyroid hormone replacement, their numbers were small.

In summary, there is now matching theoretical and empirical evidence from a variety of sources suggesting that the thyroid status of an individual is better defined by thyroid hormone levels than TSH levels. There is evidence of a continuum of thyroid hormone effects along the continuum of thyroid hormone levels, with a possible optimum around the middle of the reference range. Though TSH levels remain good screening tests for overt thyroid dysfunction, it is theoretically and empirically more sound to rely on thyroid hormone and especially fT4 levels to classify the thyroid state.

This work should result in a simplification of the understanding of thyroid physiology and pathophysiology, bringing it more in line with the understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of other parameters, whereby the status of a parameter is judged by its level rather than the level of any controlling factor. Reconsideration of the TSH-based diagnostic approach to thyroid function appears to be indicated. In turn, this would appear to have implications for clinical guidelines and research methodology.

### Current utility of first-line FT4 and TSH in screening for central hypothyroidism [^1151bGme]. Clinical Endocrinology (2024). Low credibility.

Thyroid testing strategies vary across laboratories. Historically, first-line combined thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free T4 (FT4) have been preferred by many laboratories as this approach can detect individuals with undiagnosed central hypothyroidism who might be missed with a first-line TSH-only strategy. However, an up-to-date evaluation of the utility of this approach is lacking.

- **Objectives**: We investigated the clinical utility of first-line TSH and FT4 in the detection of central hypothyroidism in day practice.

- **Design, patients, and measurements**: The All-Wales laboratory information system was queried to identify thyroid function tests in patients aged ≥ 16 years with decreased FT4 and inappropriate TSH (low-FT4). The 1-year incidence of low-FT4 was determined using mid-year population data. Clinical information of patients with low-FT4 was reviewed to determine causes of low-FT4 and the incidence of central hypothyroidism.

- **Results**: The incidence of low-FT4 varied according to the FT4 assay method (range: 98–301 cases/100,000 population/year). Fifteen new cases of central hypothyroidism were detected in two health boards, equivalent to 2 cases/100,000 population/year. The positive predictive value of low-FT4 for central hypothyroidism was 2%-4%. In a cross-section of primary care patients, low-FT4 was detected in 0.5% of all thyroid tests with assay-related differences in detection rates.

- **Conclusions**: Although low-FT4 is a common laboratory finding, the incidence of central hypothyroidism remains rare. With the currently increased rates of thyroid testing, detecting central hypothyroidism in patients continues to be uncommon.

### European society for paediatric endocrinology consensus guidelines on screening, diagnosis, and management of congenital hypothyroidism [^114BKbC3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Further research is required to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology and management of this heterogeneous disorder. Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in early neurodevelopment such that untreated severe congenital hypothyroidism (CH) can lead to neurological and psychiatric deficits, including intellectual disability, spasticity, and disturbances of gait and coordination. CH is one of the most common preventable causes of mental retardation.

Screening programs, which have been in operation over the last 30 years in most industrialized countries, have led to the successful early detection and treatment of infants with CH and have eliminated the severe neurodevelopmental deficits resulting from late diagnosis. Studies on cognitive function in patients with CH treated soon after birth have shown that normal development can be achieved in most patients, although some may have subtle neurocognitive deficits.

Estimates of the prevalence of CH vary according to the method of ascertainment: about 1 in 2000 to 3000 live births in countries with neonatal screening versus about 1 in 6700 live births before the screening era. Recent reports have indicated that the incidence of primary CH may be increasing in some countries, particularly for cases with a normally located (eutopic) thyroid gland and milder dysfunction. The reasons for this remain unclear but may relate to changes in screening thresholds.

The results from neonatal screening programs have also helped to identify a broad spectrum of thyroid dysfunctions with different underlying etiologies.

### 2018 European Thyroid Association (ETA) guidelines on the diagnosis and management of central hypothyroidism [^117Uf2Sh]. European Thyroid Journal (2018). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for central hypothyroidism, particularly concerning laboratory follow-up, the ETA 2018 guidelines recommend monitoring free T4 and TSH levels during childhood at least every two years and annually thereafter in patients under follow-up for hypothalamic-pituitary disease. Central hypothyroidism should be suspected when serum free T4 falls into the lower quartile of the normal range, especially when a decrease of more than 20% from previous values is observed (provided that the variables are measured by the same assay) despite a low or normal TSH.

### Rationalizing thyroid function testing: Which TSH cutoffs are optimal for testing free T4 [^113KVT47]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Thyroid function testing often uses thyrotropin (TSH) measurement first, followed by reflex testing for free thyroxine (T4) if TSH is outside the reference range. The utility of different TSH cutoffs for reflex testing is unknown.

- **Objective**: To examine different TSH cutoffs for reflex free T4 testing.

- **Design, setting, and patients**: We analyzed concurrent TSH and free T4 results from 120,403 individuals from a single laboratory in Western Australia (clinical cohort) and 4,568 Busselton Health Study participants (community cohort).

- **Results**: In the clinical cohort, restricting free T4 measurement to individuals with TSH ≥ 5.0 mU/L resulted in a 22% reduction in free T4 testing compared with a TSH reference range of 0.4 to 4.0 mU/L. Using TSH cutoffs of 0.2 and 6.0 mU/L resulted in a 34% reduction in free T4 testing. In the community cohort, the corresponding effect was less, with a 3.3% and 4.8% reduction in free T4 testing, respectively. In the clinical cohort, using TSH cutoffs of 0.2 and 6.0 mU/L, elevated free T4 would go undetected in 4.2% of individuals with TSH levels of 0.2 to 0.4 mU/L. In most cases, free T4 was marginally elevated and unlikely to indicate clinically relevant hyperthyroidism. Low free T4 would go undetected in 2.5% of individuals with TSH levels of 4 to 6 mU/L; in 94% of these, free T4 was marginally reduced and unlikely to indicate clinically relevant hypothyroidism.

- **Conclusions**: Setting TSH cutoffs at 0.1 to 0.2 mU/L less than and 1 to 2 mU/L greater than the reference range for reflex testing of free T4 would reduce the need for free T4 testing, with minimal effect.

### The ages and TSH values of patients being prescribed levothyroxine [^115ykRjT]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism affects approximately 5% of the United States population, and synthetic thyroxine in the form of levothyroxine (LT4) is the most prescribed therapy for this common condition. Autoimmune hypothyroidism is generally progressive, with a decrement in endogenous thyroid function occurring over time, such that overt hypothyroidism would occur if the thyroid hormone deficiency is untreated. However, hypothyroidism may initially be diagnosed when it is mild or subclinical, at a time when the serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is minimally elevated below 10 mIU/L and the serum thyroid hormone levels are normal. Symptoms of hypothyroidism are not always specific for this condition, and each of the symptoms generally associated with hypothyroidism may also have non-thyroid causes. As attribution of the cause of symptoms is not a simple matter, many physicians may err on the side of treating mild TSH elevations with the expectation that symptoms may improve. Thus, treatment with LT4 may be initiated for borderline TSH elevations. The authors also hypothesize that LT4 may even be prescribed for unconfirmed serum TSH elevations, or even without TSH elevation, based on the symptoms that the patient is experiencing.

LT4 is being prescribed with increasing frequency, both in the United States and in other countries. Several studies have shown that the TSH threshold at which LT4 therapy is initiated has fallen over time, such that an increasing number of cases of subclinical hypothyroidism are being treated and the mean or median TSH value continues to decline.

Alternatively, the state-of-the-art APS can be derived from the evaluation and comparison of laboratory methods or using peer comparison data from proficiency testing programs. In general, the TSH assays in clinical practice meet the desirable APS (based on biological variation) for imprecision; however, this may not be true for fT4 assays. Importantly, large intermethod biases are observed for both TSH and fT4. This prevents the adoption of universal reference intervals and medical decision limits for thyroid tests. Moreover, the relationship between TSH and fT4 varies depending on the specific assay method used.

- **Biological variability of TSH and TH concentrations**: The log-linear TSH–fT4 relationship illustrates both within- and between-subject biological variability in healthy individuals; this variability increases with both thyroid and nonthyroidal illnesses. Results from systematic studies in healthy mono- and dizygotic twins, repetitive sampling studies, and the testing of individuals or (sub-)populations in different regions have shown markedly narrower within-subject variability (e.g. during monthly sampling) than between-subject variations. Such studies reveal that heritability accounts for 30% to 65% of the variance in TSH, fT4, fT3, and the fT4 × TSH product. Population-based reference intervals for thyroid test variables are, therefore, much broader than the rather narrow within-subject variance and consequently are less useful for monitoring an individual patient.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction with free T4 instead of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) improves efficiency in older adults in primary care [^113jZXuL]. Age and Ageing (2022). Low credibility.

It should be noted that chronic disease, which is frequent in older adults, could be associated with non-thyroidal illness (NTI) and in severe cases may result in decreased fT4, generating false positives. Yet, TSH elevations are often found in the recovery phase after NTI, mimicking subclinical hypothyroidism (SCHT).

Alternatively, the positive predictive value (PPV) of screening for thyroid dysfunction could be improved by elevating the TSH cutoff value. Several authors have proposed this approach. However, with this strategy, individuals with hypothyroidism and a limited elevation of TSH would be missed. In our population, the increase in PPV was only limited compared to the fT4-based strategy.

Some limitations should be acknowledged. Firstly, due to the retrospective nature of the study, we cannot exclude the possibility that individuals included in the study may have had a history of thyroid disease, which we could not filter from the available laboratory data, for example, in cases where patients have visited other laboratories for checkups. Secondly, the study group was relatively small, and further prospective studies with sufficient power are needed to validate our findings. Thirdly, the determination of optimal cutoff values for TSH and fT4 — which currently vary significantly within geographical areas and method groups — should be investigated in follow-up studies. This is hampered by the lack of a gold standard test for hypothyroidism, and the combination of test results from two tests, fT4 and TSH, determines the diagnosis.

In conclusion, our results suggest that screening with fT4 may improve the efficiency of thyroid dysfunction detection in older adults in primary care settings.

### Use of the free thyroxine index to refine the lower limit of a free thyroxine immunoassay for detection of secondary hypothyroidism [^1137Lksb]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the utility of measuring the free T4 index (FT4I) in patients with low free T4 (FT4) levels using immunoassay and normal thyroid-stimulating hormone for the evaluation of secondary hypothyroidism.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective medical chart review of patients seen at a single institution as outpatients who had a simultaneously normal thyroid-stimulating hormone level, low FT4 level, and any FT4I measured between June 2014 and October 2016. Demographic, laboratory, and imaging data were collected. Using FT4I as the reference for the diagnosis of hypothyroidism, the sensitivity and specificity of the FT4 immunoassay's lower-limit thresholds were determined. Within each threshold group, available brain imaging and biochemical evaluation were categorized according to the presence or absence of pituitary disease.

- **Results**: A total of 155 sets of result pairs (FT4 and FT4I) performed on 118 subjects were analyzed. The lower limit of a normal FT4 level by immunoassay at this institution was 0.93 ng/dL, though all pairs with FT4 ≥ 0.89 ng/dL had a normal FT4I. All pairs with FT4 ≤ 0.67 ng/dL had a low FT4I. No pituitary macroadenomas were identified in any subject, though the rates of pituitary imaging in this patient sample were low.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with a borderline low FT4 level by immunoassay often have a normal FT4I. In such patients at our center, significant structural and biochemical pituitary pathology was uncommon.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): An American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^111Wrp1V]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

- **The clinical utility of TSH measurement**: Serum TSH is one of the most frequently measured analytes in the outpatient setting. Thyroid disease is common and, in most cases, can be easily diagnosed using TSH measurement. The availability of high-quality, sensitive, specific, and inexpensive TSH assays makes screening for thyroid disease cost-effective. Because of the log-linear relationship of TSH to fT4, deviations of TSH concentration from population-specific reference intervals represent the preferred initial test for the evaluation of thyroid function.

Understanding the indications for, and limitations of, TSH measurement and the interpretation of TSH results is essential for practicing high-quality, cost-effective medicine. TSH is used to screen newborns for primary congenital hypothyroidism and to screen adults at risk for thyroid disease. Primary congenital hypothyroidism is an endocrine emergency because delays in initiating treatment result in an irreversible loss of cognitive function. Accordingly, the turnaround time from specimen collection to patient follow-up is a major consideration in the implementation and quality assessment of newborn screening programs.

Interpreting the results for these apparently similar indications for TSH measurement is, however, very different. Patient age is an important factor that must be considered when interpreting TSH results. For example, TSH concentrations in newborns less than 3 days of age are difficult to interpret due to the postnatal TSH surge.

### Endocrine dysfunction after traumatic brain injury: An ignored clinical syndrome [^1145Vhf8]. Neurocritical Care (2023). High credibility.

Thyroid stimulating hormone deficiency is characterized by hypothyroidism, which is infrequent in the early stage and difficult to recognize due to associated nonspecific features. Low T3 and T4 levels with normal TSH levels in the early stage can result from the injury itself and may persist for 2–3 weeks. This low-T3-syndrome-like state cannot reliably identify secondary hypothyroidism due to pituitary dysfunction. TSH deficiency is less frequent, occurring in 4.1–6.2% of cases 12 months after injury. In a long-term follow-up study of children with severe TBI, about 13% of patients exhibited pituitary dysfunction (10% growth hormone deficiency, 3% TSH deficiency, and 2% adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency) when followed for 1–7 years post-TBI. Experimental studies indicate that thyroid hormones play a role in reducing brain edema and stimulating neural regeneration.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: When to consider treatment [^112DJd5K]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by a low or undetectable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level, with normal free thyroxine and total or free triiodothyronine levels. It can result from increased endogenous production of thyroid hormone, as seen in Graves' disease, toxic nodular goiter, or transient thyroiditis. Additionally, it may arise from the administration of thyroid hormone to treat malignant thyroid disease or from unintentional excessive replacement therapy. The prevalence of subclinical hyperthyroidism in the general population is about 1% to 2%, though it may be higher in iodine-deficient areas.

The rate of progression to overt hyperthyroidism is higher in individuals with thyroid-stimulating hormone levels less than 0.1 mIU per L compared to those with low but detectable levels. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is linked to increased risks of atrial fibrillation and heart failure in older adults, as well as increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Moreover, it presents a risk of decreased bone mineral density and increased bone fracture risk in postmenopausal women. However, the effectiveness of treatment in preventing these conditions remains unclear. The possible association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and quality-of-life parameters and cognition is controversial.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms associated with screening for thyroid dysfunction in asymptomatic individuals. Meanwhile, the American Thyroid Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommend treating patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone level…

- **Recommendations**:

3.2.1 The monitoring of L-T4 treatment should be based on periodic measurements of serum or plasma FT4 (or TT4) and TSH concentrations. Blood samples for laboratory evaluation should be collected at least 4 hours after the last L-T4 administration. We recommend maintaining TSH within the age-specific reference range, avoiding undetectable TSH levels (< 0.05 mU/L), and keeping serum concentrations of TT4 or FT4 in the upper half of the age-specific reference range. If necessary, treatment should be adjusted according to the hormone concentrations measured. However, decreases in L-T4 dose should not be based on a single high FT4 concentration during treatment. Clinicians should be familiar with the reference ranges for the methods used by the laboratory performing the tests.

3.2.2 We recommend performing the first follow-up examination 1 to 2 weeks after the start of L-T4 treatment, with intense follow-up over the first year of life (every 2 weeks until TSH levels are completely normalized and every 1 to 3 months thereafter, until the age of 12 months). Between the ages of 1 and 3 years, children should undergo frequent clinical and laboratory evaluations (every 2 to 4 months), with regular evaluations every 3 to 12 months thereafter until growth is completed. Measurements should be performed at more frequent intervals if compliance is questioned, abnormal values are obtained, or 4 to 6 weeks after any change in L-T4 dose or formulation (e.g. switch from brand to generic L-T4).

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^115jXbXK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

The measurement of free thyroid hormones (THs) and thyrotropin (TSH) using automated immunoassays is central to the diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction. Using illustrative cases, we describe a diagnostic approach to discordant thyroid function tests, focusing on entities causing elevated free thyroxine and/or free triiodothyronine measurements with nonsuppressed TSH levels. Different types of analytical interference (e.g. abnormal thyroid hormone binding proteins, antibodies to iodothyronines or TSH, heterophile antibodies, biotin) or disorders (e.g. resistance to thyroid hormone β or α, monocarboxylate transporter 8 or selenoprotein deficiency, TSH-secreting pituitary tumor) that can cause this biochemical pattern will be considered.

We show that a structured approach, combining clinical assessment with additional laboratory investigations to exclude assay artifact, followed by genetic testing or specialized imaging, can establish a correct diagnosis, potentially preventing unnecessary investigation or inappropriate therapy.

Regarding the medical management of hypothyroidism, specifically in relation to levothyroxine therapy, the AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of L-thyroxine therapy in female patients of childbearing age with serum TSH levels within the reference range for the local laboratory if:

- **Serum TSH > 2.5 mIU/L**: In patients planning a pregnancy in the immediate future, including those undergoing assisted reproduction.

- **Serum TSH > 2.5 mIU/L**: During the first trimester of pregnancy.

- **Serum TSH > 3.0 mIU/L**: During the second trimester of pregnancy.

- **Serum TSH > 3.5 mIU/L**: During the third trimester of pregnancy.

### The role of supporting and disruptive mechanisms of FT3 homeostasis in regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis [^112MyaYm]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Physiologically, FT3 is the more active thyroid hormone, apart from some instances of direct (type 4) signaling of T4. The bulk of T3 is found within the cells, as opposed to T4, which is predominantly an extracellular hormone. This allows for differentiated local adaptation of the T3 levels at the cellular level in various tissues. Nevertheless, the extracellular and intracellular compartments are in equilibrium. The sum effect of circulating FT3 is reported back to the hypothalamus and pituitary to adjust FT4 production and systemic FT3 production via TSH-feedforward, protecting FT3 homeostasis even in the presence of mild thyroid failure. This mechanism is disrupted in patients with insufficient remaining functional thyroid tissue or pituitary/hypothalamic insufficiency.

The interindividual variation in the distribution of the TSH, FT4, and FT3 response curves, and their combination determines the balance point expressed between the hormones in a person and shifts it under different conditions. In the population, disaggregation of individual correlations produces the statistical phenomenon of stratification collider bias (Simpson's paradox), to an extent that precludes the use of averaging statistics. As a result, strong correlations between TSH and both FT4 and clinical symptoms in overt primary hypothyroidism weaken towards the euthyroid range. This may, at least partly, explain why a recent meta-analysis found clinical outcomes to be more strongly associated with thyroid hormones than TSH levels. In subclinical hypothyroidism, the levels of FT3 and FT4 dissociate.

### Clinical review: The thyroid in mind: cognitive function and low thyrotropin in older people [^113xy1xT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

SH is defined as a serum TSH concentration below the reference range, with normal free T4 (FT4) and free T3 (FT3) levels. It can be divided into two groups: patients with a mildly reduced TSH (0.1–0.4 mU/liter) can be classified as having grade I SH, whereas those with a serum TSH of less than 0.1 mU/liter, including a completely suppressed TSH level (< 0.01 mU/liter), are classified as having grade II SH. The prevalence of SH has been reported to range from 0.63 to 2.1% in epidemiological studies.

Most people with SH have no symptoms of hyperthyroidism, and relatively few develop specific complications attributable to SH such as atrial fibrillation or osteoporosis. Prognostically, many people with SH experience only a transient abnormality of thyroid function, with resolution of biochemical abnormalities found in 25–75% of those with grade I SH on repeat testing. Thus, the majority of individuals with grade I SH do not have intrinsic thyroid disease; the low TSH reflects nonthyroidal illness or drug effects. Nevertheless, approximately 1–2% of patients over the age of 60 with SH progress to overt hyperthyroidism, with progression most likely in those with grade II SH. This reflects the indolent nature of multinodular goiter as the dominant cause in this age group, with mild thyroid autonomy developing slowly. A small number of individuals with SH have early Graves' disease, and progression to overt hyperthyroidism is more probable in these cases. Conversely, 1–2% of elderly individuals have a persistent and stably low serum TSH.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111mVjnY]. Thyroid (2020). Low credibility.

Thyroid function testing is based on the measurement of thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Patients are therefore classified as having euthyroidism (normal TSH and thyroid hormone levels), overt thyroid dysfunction (abnormal TSH and thyroid hormone levels), subclinical thyroid dysfunction (abnormal TSH/normal thyroid hormone levels), and isolated hyper/hypothyroxinemia (normal TSH/abnormal thyroid hormone levels).

This classification of thyroid function is based on the concept of TSH levels being the most sensitive indicator of thyroid function, such that subclinical thyroid dysfunction as currently defined is believed to be more significant than isolated hyper/hypothyroxinemia, as indicated by the alternative term for the latter, "euthyroid hyper/hypothyroidism".

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is common and comprises most cases of thyroid dysfunction, with a population prevalence of approximately 5%, increasing to 15% in older adults. Even though it is generally asymptomatic or associated only with non-specific symptoms, subclinical thyroid dysfunction has been associated with many adverse outcomes across a variety of organ systems. Therefore, despite the lack of convincing evidence of significant benefit, treatment for subclinical thyroid dysfunction has been recommended in certain circumstances.

It has previously been suggested by some authors that the earlier definition of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is overly simple and that its diagnosis should not be based solely on the TSH level being outside of a general population range. Rather, it is claimed that more accurate…

### Congenital hypothyroidism: Screening and management [^117AYNKk]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for congenital hypothyroidism, specifically concerning levothyroxine, the AAP 2023 guidelines recommend the following:

- **For indications in primary CH**: Consider initiating levothyroxine therapy or closely monitor serum TSH and fT4 every 1–2 weeks without treatment if serum TSH is elevated but ≤ 20 mIU/L and serum fT4 is normal on the confirmatory serum sample.
- **Initiate levothyroxine therapy** if fT4 becomes low or if TSH elevation > 10 mIU/L persists beyond 4 weeks of age.

### TSH and FT4 reference interval recommendations and prevalence of gestational thyroid dysfunction: Quantification of current diagnostic approaches [^117N3s5r]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Accurately diagnosing thyroid dysfunction in pregnancy remains challenging. While the calculation of population- and pregnancy-specific TSH and FT4 reference intervals is considered the optimal approach, this is often not feasible. Our study highlights the suboptimal sensitivity and false discovery rate (FDR) that common alternative approaches, such as using a fixed TSH upper limit of 4.0 mU/L or subtracting 0.5 mU/L from the TSH upper limit, have in detecting specific thyroid function test abnormalities. Moreover, it is clear from these data that maximizing sensitivity often comes at the cost of a higher FDR, which constitutes a difficult tradeoff. We also identify that the use of nonpregnancy FT4 reference intervals was a primary contributor to diagnostic inaccuracy, especially in the detection of overt hypothyroidism — a condition where prompt management is warranted to mitigate adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.

These data provide insights into the extent to which diagnostic accuracy of gestational thyroid function test abnormalities can be influenced by different strategies for defining TSH and/or FT4 cut-offs. This information can be used to weigh the pros and cons of future policy recommendations. An important result from this study is the poor diagnostic accuracy and high FDR with the use of the alternative approaches to identify thyroid function test abnormalities with a treatment indication in the first and second trimesters. Two main concepts about the use of alternative approaches arise from these data: (1) The large percentage of overdiagnosis (FDR) in general.

### Interpretation of thyroid function tests [^114Ub1fK]. Lancet (2001). Low credibility.

The introduction of sensitive thyrotropin assays and free thyroid hormone measurements has simplified the interpretation of thyroid function tests. However, important pitfalls and difficult cases still exist. In this review, thyroid function test results are grouped into six different patterns. We propose that if assays for thyrotropin, free T3, and free T4 are all done, knowledge of these patterns, coupled with clinical details and simple additional tests, allows a diagnosis to be made in almost all cases.

### Congenital hypothyroidism: Screening and management [^115gHfqf]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for congenital hypothyroidism, specifically in evaluating the permanence of hypothyroidism, AAP 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining repeat serum TSH and fT4 levels in another 4–8 weeks to determine the following if the TSH is mildly elevated (greater than the age-specific reference range but ≤ 10 mIU/L) and fT4 is normal:

- **Normal thyroid function**: Indicates transient congenital hypothyroidism (CH).

- **Permanent CH**: Characterized by TSH > 10 mIU/L or low fT4.

- **Persistent hyperthyrotropinemia**: TSH persistently elevated but ≤ 10 mIU/L, with normal fT4.

### Update on subclinical hyperthyroidism [^114Xo7vx]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by low or undetectable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, with normal free thyroxine and total or free triiodothyronine levels. It can be caused by increased endogenous production of thyroid hormone, as in Graves disease or toxic nodular goiter, or through administration of thyroid hormone for treatment of malignant thyroid disease or unintentional excessive thyroid hormone therapy.

The rate of progression to overt hyperthyroidism is higher in individuals with suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone levels compared to those with low but detectable levels. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation in older adults and decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women. However, the effectiveness of treatment in preventing these conditions is unknown.

- **Association with cardiovascular effects**: Lesser-quality evidence suggests associations with increased heart rate, left ventricular mass, and increased bone turnover markers.
- **Quality of life parameters and mortality rates**: Potential associations with cognition and increased mortality rates are controversial.

Prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to address the effects of early treatment on potential morbidities. These trials will help determine whether screening should be recommended in the asymptomatic general population.

### Different causes of reduced sensitivity to thyroid hormone: Diagnosis and clinical management [^111REMBW]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Normal thyroid hormone (TH) metabolism and action require adequate cellular TH signaling. This involves the proper function of TH transporters in the plasma membrane, intracellular deiodination of TH, and the action of the bioactive hormone T3 at its nuclear receptors (TRs). This review summarizes the discoveries of different syndromes with reduced sensitivity at the cellular level. Mutations in the TH transporter MCT8 cause psychomotor retardation and abnormal thyroid parameters. Mutations in the SBP2 protein, which is required for normal deiodination, result in a multisystem disorder, including abnormal thyroid function tests. Mutations in TRβ1 are a well-known cause of resistance to TH with mostly a mild phenotype, while only recently have patients with mutations in TRα1 been identified. These latter patients have slightly abnormal TH levels, growth retardation, and cognitive defects. This review will describe the mechanisms of disease, clinical phenotype, diagnostic testing, and suggestions for treatment strategies for each of these syndromes.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113g3Xto]. Thyroid (2020). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, to the best of our knowledge, the information from individual studies demonstrating the superiority of thyroid hormone levels in association with individual clinical parameters has not been synthesized into a formal conclusion regarding the biochemical assessment of thyroid function in general.

It has been suggested that despite TSH being considered a more sensitive indicator of thyroid status, fT4 may be a more sensitive indicator of "cardiac" or "tissue" thyroid status. Our study strengthens and generalizes this proposition, indicating that fT4 is a more sensitive indicator of thyroid status because it is a better indicator of tissue and organ effects.

The superior association of clinical parameters with fT4 as compared to TSH levels has often been attributed to a putative disturbance of set point physiology, a significant difference between pituitary and peripheral sensitivity to fT4, or statistical and other factors, including reverse causation.

Explanations related to set points are denied in the first instance by evidence that the relatively stable thyroid hormone levels seen in individuals are better explained by a model of "balance points" or "equilibrium points" rather than "set points". Notwithstanding this concept, it has been suggested that in older adults, there is an alteration of what is termed "set point physiology", in that TSH may be less suppressed by any given rise in fT4. However, in this situation, though the range of TSH may change, any physiological association with greater or lesser TSH levels is affected.

### Clinical review: Central hypothyroidism: pathogenic, diagnostic, and therapeutic challenges [^117U2RLg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Central hypothyroidism (CH) is a particular hypothyroid condition due to insufficient stimulation by TSH of an otherwise normal thyroid gland. This condition raises several challenges for clinicians. Therefore, a review of the most relevant findings on CH epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical management has been performed.

- **Methodology**: The relevant papers were selected by a PubMed search using appropriate keywords.

- **Main findings**: CH can be the consequence of various disorders affecting either the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus, but most frequently affecting both of them. CH is about 1000-fold rarer than primary hypothyroidism. Except for neonatal CH due to biallelic TSHβ mutations, the thyroid hormone defect is rarely as profound as can be observed in some primary forms. In contrast with primary hypothyroidism, CH is most frequently characterized by low/normal TSH levels, and adequate thyroid hormone replacement is associated with the suppression of residual TSH secretion. Thus, CH often represents a clinical challenge because physicians cannot rely on the systematic use of the "reflex TSH strategy". The clinical management of CH is further complicated by the frequent combination with other pituitary deficiencies and their substitution.

### Normal limits for serum thyrotropin vary greatly depending on method [^112G78x2]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels within populations do not follow a Gaussian distribution, and normal limits are derived after mathematical normalization. The clinical relevance of these limits is unknown. The objective of this study was to compare upper and lower TSH limits by four data normalization methods with non-normalized data and assess their clinical relevance.

- **Design, patients and measurements**: Results of blood samples taken by community physicians and stored in a computerized database were analyzed after removing samples from patients with evidence of thyroid illness. TSH values were normalized by the Hoffmann and Tukey methods, and each method with natural log transformation. Non-normalized data for TSH in the uppermost and lowermost percentile were also calculated. Clinical relevance was determined by alterations in thyroid hormone levels at, below, and above the limits for each method.

- **Results**: The maximal reduction from non-normalized data for the upper normal limit (UNL) was by the Hoffman method (43% = 3.1 mIU/l). The maximal increase for the lower normal limit (LNL) was also by the Hoffman method (708% = 0.81 mIU/l). There was very limited difference in average FT3 and FT4 between patients with TSH within, below, or above the normal range for all methods.

- **Conclusions**: Different normalization methods alter the normal limits greatly. However, in individuals without thyroid illness, thyroid hormone values are stable over a wide range of TSH levels including beyond the UNL for all methods. Indeed, there may be no true universal upper TSH cut-off.

- **Criteria for diagnosis**:

	- **Biochemical criteria for use in the decision to initiate treatment in an infant with high TSH and/or low FT4 concentration**:

		**Recommendations**:

		We recommend starting treatment immediately after baseline serum TSH and FT4 determination if DBS TSH concentration is ≥ 40 mU/L of whole blood. If DBS TSH concentration is 20 mU/L, even if serum FT4 concentration is normal, treatment initiation is advised. When venous TSH concentration is between 6 and 20 mU/L in a well baby with an FT4 concentration within the normal limits for age, we suggest diagnostic imaging to try to establish a definitive diagnosis. If the TSH concentration remains high for more than 3 to 4 weeks, we suggest (in discussion with the family) either starting L-T4 supplementation immediately and retesting, off treatment, at a later stage; or retesting 2 weeks later without treatment.

		**Evidence**:

		L-T4 treatment must be started immediately if venous FT4 or TT4 levels are low, given the known adverse effect of untreated decompensated congenital hypothyroidism (CH) on somatic growth and neurodevelopment. Previous work has shown that the likelihood of decompensated hypothyroidism is high if DBS TSH values are above 40 mU/L, justifying immediate treatment.

### Whole-genome sequence-based analysis of thyroid function [^1144SRbu]. Nature Communications (2015). Low credibility.

Normal thyroid function is essential for health, but its genetic architecture remains poorly understood. For the heritable thyroid traits thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4), we analyze whole-genome sequence data from the UK10K project (N = 2,287). Using additional whole-genome sequence and deeply imputed data sets, we report meta-analysis results for common variants (MAF ≥ 1%) associated with TSH and FT4 (N = 16,335).

- **Thyrotropin (TSH)**: We identify a novel variant in SYN2 (MAF = 23.5%, P = 6.15 × 10^(-9)) and a new independent variant in PDE8B (MAF = 10.4%, P = 5.94 × 10^(-14)).

- **Free thyroxine (FT4)**: We report a low-frequency variant near B4GALT6/SLC25A52 (MAF = 3.2%, P = 1.27 × 10^(-9)) tagging a rare TTR variant (MAF = 0.4%, P = 2.14 × 10^(-11)).

All common variants explain ≥ 20% of the variance in TSH and FT4. The analysis of rare variants (MAF < 1%) using sequence kernel association testing reveals a novel association with FT4 in NRG1. Our results demonstrate that increased coverage in whole-genome sequence association studies identifies novel variants associated with thyroid function.

This document aims to provide a state-of-the-art status report on the progress achieved in thyroid testing, including thyrotropin (TSH), thyroxine (T4), and triiodothyronine (T3). The target audience for this document includes general practitioners, endocrinologists, and laboratory professionals. It is not a systematic review or a guidance document addressing currently encountered diagnostic and clinical challenges related to these three key parameters of thyroid testing. It does not cover the use of thyroid antibodies for investigating the etiology of thyroid dysfunction, or the use of thyroglobulin as a tumor marker for differentiated thyroid cancer or the investigation of primary congenital or acquired hypothyroidism.

- **Key clinical points for interpreting thyroid tests**: Clinically relevant aspects of thyroid pathophysiology and the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid-peripheral axis have recently been reviewed elsewhere. Generic abbreviations for thyroid hormones (THs), T4 and T3, are used in this text if both total and free TH are meant. Total T4 (TT4) and total T3 (TT3) are used for total and free T4 (fT4) or free T3 (fT3) for free TH concentrations, respectively.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^111CgtxG]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is defined as an abnormal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level (reference range: 0.45 to 4.50 microU per mL) with free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels within their reference ranges. The management of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is controversial. The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism is about 4 to 8.5 percent and may be as high as 20 percent in women older than 60 years. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is found in approximately 2 percent of the population. Most national organizations recommend against routine screening of asymptomatic patients, but screening is recommended for high-risk populations. There is good evidence that subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with progression to overt disease. Patients with a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level greater than 10 microU per mL have a higher incidence of elevated serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations; however, evidence is lacking for other associations. There is insufficient evidence that treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is beneficial. A serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level of less than 0.1 microU per mL is associated with progression to overt hyperthyroidism, atrial fibrillation, reduced bone mineral density, and cardiac dysfunction. There is little evidence that early treatment alters the clinical course.
