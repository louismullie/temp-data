## Question

What is the name of the female character played by comedian Flip Wilson on his 1970s TV show?

Answer Choices:
A. Miss Jackie
B. Elizabeth Sanford
C. Geraldine Jones
D. Gladys Knight

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which female character was played by comedian Flip Wilson on his 1970s television show, with answer choices including Miss Jackie, Elizabeth Sanford, Geraldine Jones, and Gladys Knight. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether any of the provided references directly mention Flip Wilson or his characters. Then, I should verify which option aligns with widely known cultural knowledge about Flip Wilson's iconic persona. Next, I will consider whether any of the distractors map to other famous 1970s TV characters or real people to avoid a trap. Finally, I will confirm the correct choice and briefly justify why the alternatives are incorrect.

> Let me first confirm the presence of relevant information in the supplied materials. Wait, let me verify whether Flip Wilson or his show are mentioned anywhere in the references. I need to check carefully because if the documents are silent, I should not over-interpret them. On review, I do not see any mention of Flip Wilson, his television program, or the names of his characters in the provided sources, so I cannot rely on these documents to answer the question directly.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the answer using external cultural knowledge while keeping the self-check discipline. Flip Wilson's most famous recurring character was Geraldine Jones, a sassy, quick-witted woman known for the catchphrase "The devil made me do it", which became a cultural touchstone in the early 1970s. This aligns with the classic television history of The Flip Wilson Show and is the standard answer to this question in trivia and reference contexts.

> I will now examine the distractors to ensure I'm not missing a subtle clue. Elizabeth Sanford sounds like a conflation with Elizabeth from Sanford and Son, but that character was played by Redd Foxx and Demond Wilson, not Flip Wilson, so that option is incorrect. Gladys Knight is the name of the famous singer, not a fictional TV character, so that is also incorrect. Miss Jackie does not correspond to a well-known Flip Wilson character, making it implausible compared with Geraldine Jones.

> But wait, what if I'm misremembering the exact spelling or name variant? Let me reconsider and double-check. The iconic character is consistently cited as Geraldine Jones in reputable pop-culture references and retrospectives of The Flip Wilson Show, and none of the alternatives match that established persona, reinforcing that Geraldine Jones is the correct choice.

> Final answer: C. Geraldine Jones.

---

The female character played by comedian Flip Wilson on his 1970s TV show was **Geraldine Jones**. Geraldine was a sassy, confident woman known for her catchphrase, "The devil made me do it!" and became one of the most iconic characters of the era. The other options are incorrect: Miss Jackie was not a recurring character, Elizabeth Sanford refers to a character from a different show, and Gladys Knight is a singer, not a character.

### Geoffrey knight and his contribution to psychosurgery [^82f2d7c6]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2017). Low credibility.

This paper retraces the fundamental achievements of Geoffrey Knight (1906–1994), a British neurosurgeon and a pioneer in the field of psychosurgery. His career developed in the 1950s and 1960s, when-following the unregulated practice of frontal lobotomies-strong criticism arose in the medical community and in the general public against psychosurgery. Geoffrey Knight's clinical research focused on identifying new, selective targets to limit the side effects of psychosurgery while improving the outcome of patients affected by mental disorders. Following the example of William Beecher Scoville, he initially developed restricted orbital undercutting as a less invasive alternative to standard frontal lobotomy. He then developed stereotactic subcaudate tractotomy, with the use of an original stereotactic device. Knight stressed the importance of the anatomy and neurophysiology of the structures targeted in subcaudate tractotomy, with particular regard to the fibers connecting the anterior cingulate region, the amygdala, the orbitofrontal cortex, and the hypothalamus. Of interest, the role of these white matter connections has been recently recognized in deep brain stimulation for major depression and anorexia nervosa. This is perhaps the most enduring legacy of Knight to the field of psychosurgery. He refined frontal leucotomies by selecting a restricted target at the center of a network that plays a crucial role in controlling mood disorders. He then developed a safe, minimally invasive stereotactic operation to reach this target. His work, well ahead of his time, still represents a valid reference on which to build future clinical experience in the modern era of neuromodulation for psychiatric diseases.

### Estrogen receptor: a paradigm for targeted therapy [^9222fe72]. Cancer Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Nearly two-thirds of breast cancers overexpress estrogen receptors, and endocrine therapy is considered the backbone of systemic therapy both in early and advanced settings. While this is now widely recognized in clinical practice, this is the culmination of outstanding contribution of many investigators and patients. Indubitably, estrogen receptor targeting has had the most impact among targeted therapies and has significantly affected patient survival. In this commentary, we revisit a landmark article published in Cancer Research in 1977 by Knight and colleagues, which laid the groundwork for the use of estrogen receptors in prognostication and adjuvant treatment selection, as well as some of the key breakthroughs in estrogen receptor biology that span more than a century. See related article by Knight and colleagues, Cancer Res 1977;37:4669–71.

### Epigenetic clocks for gestational age: statistical and study design considerations [^a30e32d3]. Clinical Epigenetics (2017). Low credibility.

Letter to the editor

In two recent articles, Bohlin et al. and Knight et al. develop DNA methylation clocks for gestational age at delivery (GA) using cord and newborn blood. These follow from the clock of Horvath, which has been used to obtain a measure of age acceleration, the discrepancy between estimated and chronological age, calculated as the residual when regressing one on the other. Associations between age acceleration and a wide range of phenotypes have been observed, including all-cause mortality. The newly developed GA clocks offer the similar possibility to assess determinants of GA acceleration (GAA) and associations with subsequent outcomes. A recent article in this journal used the GA clock developed by Knight et al. to examine associations with maternal and offspring characteristics.

We applied both GA clocks to cord blood DNA methylation data from 863 members of the ARIES cohort in order to test associations of GAA with birth weight. We observed a strong positive correlation with the Bohlin GAA estimate (R = 0.20, p = 5.3 × 10 −9) and a comparatively weak correlation with the Knight estimate (R = 0.055, p = 0.11).

To investigate this discrepancy, we asked how well both clocks estimated GA in ARIES. Although both were correlated with GA (Bohlin R = 0.65; Knight R = 0.37), these correlations are below those reported in their original publications (Bohlin R = 0.81; Knight R = 0.91). In the case of Bohlin, this is expected given that their training and testing sets were drawn from the same cohort study. This was not the case for Knight. The scatterplot of the Knight test results (Figure 1b of) suggested that the strong correlation may have been driven by the inclusion of data for 183 preterm infants in the test set. We tested this hypothesis by adding these preterm infants to ARIES, increasing the percentage of preterm infants (GA < 37 weeks) from 2.8 to 19.8%. As expected, the correlation of the Knight GA estimate rose from R = 0.37 in ARIES alone to R = 0.89.

### Accelerated epigenetic age at birth and child emotional and behavioura development in early childhood: a meta-analysis of four prospective cohort studies in ECHO [^57dcc951]. Epigenetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Epigenetic age calculation

Each cohort derived epigenetic age at birth according to a pre-specified analysis plan independently using algorithms published by Knight. The Knight method used an elastic net approach with 10-fold cross-validation in the training set and identified a model consisting of 148 CpG sites that can estimate epigenetic gestational age. The estimation of epigenetic age using the Knight clock was performed using R statistical software with codes supplied by Knight et al. Due to the cohort-specific QC filters applied to DNA methylation data, some CpG sites required to compute the Knight clock may have been missing. If a required CpG for the clock computation was filtered out, methylation values were either imputed using simple random sampling imputation or substituted from the closest CpG sites (less than 2000 base pairs). Epigenetic age acceleration was then derived as the residual from a linear model of epigenetic age regressed on gestational age adjusting for cell-type proportions.

### Knights, knaves, pawns and queens: attitudes to behaviour in postwar britain [^681d9dd0]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2007). Low credibility.

The choice agenda is currently one of the most prominent in public policy. One of its main architects, Julian Le Grand, has used the metaphors of knights, knaves, pawns and queens to characterise changing attitudes to questions of motivation and behaviour among public servants and service users. He has said, for example, that, in the immediate postwar period, public servants were perceived as public-spirited altruists (or knights), whereas service users were seen as passive (or pawns). It was only in the mid-1980s that public servants came to be seen as essentially self-interested (knaves) and service users came to be regarded as consumers (queens). However, this highly influential model has undergone remarkably little critical scrutiny to date. This article explores the debate over transmitted deprivation in the 1970s to provide a historically grounded piece of analysis to explore the accuracy and utility of these metaphors. It challenges Le Grand's arguments in three respects. Firstly, a concern with behaviour and agency went much broader than social security fraud. Secondly, the metaphor of pawns is inadequate for characterising attitudes towards the poor and service users. Finally, Le Grand's periodisation of the postwar era also has serious flaws.

### Association between socioeconomic factors, race, and use of a specialty memory clinic [^b93b0207]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Many clinicians at the Washington University Memory Diagnostic Center are engaged in research at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC). For 2 decades, the African American Advisory Board of the Knight ADRC has worked to increase the participation of Black patients in Alzheimer disease research, promote inclusive research practices, and increase the diversity of physicians in the department. More recently, the Knight ADRC created the Health Disparities and Equity Core to center diversity, equity, and inclusion in all aspects of the Knight ADRC's functions. The efforts of the Knight ADRC to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion have now been extended to clinical care through this and other work. The first step is the ability to measure disparities in care, and the EHR can enable continuous monitoring of health care disparities and evaluation of the effectiveness of any initiatives to reduce disparities. Such initiatives may include increased outreach to less affluent neighborhoods with a higher frequency of individuals from minoritized groups, reducing requirements for scheduling an initial appointment, and hiring clinicians who represent minoritized groups. At a time when memory care may be undergoing a major transformation, this study provides additional motivation for addressing disparities that are likely to affect patient care and demonstrates that the EHR may provide a powerful tool to monitor and potentially reduce disparities in memory care.

### Highly accurate blood test for Alzheimer's disease is similar or superior to clinical cerebrospinal fluid tests [^dd78c7ff]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

With the emergence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) disease-modifying therapies, identifying patients who could benefit from these treatments becomes critical. In this study, we evaluated whether a precise blood test could perform as well as established cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests in detecting amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles. Plasma %p-tau217 (ratio of phosporylated-tau217 to non-phosphorylated tau) was analyzed by mass spectrometry in the Swedish BioFINDER-2 cohort (n = 1,422) and the US Charles F. and Joanne Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (Knight ADRC) cohort (n = 337). Matched CSF samples were analyzed with clinically used and FDA-approved automated immunoassays for Aβ42/40 and p-tau181/Aβ42. The primary and secondary outcomes were detection of brain Aβ or tau pathology, respectively, using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging as the reference standard. Main analyses were focused on individuals with cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia), which is the target population for available disease-modifying treatments. Plasma %p-tau217 was clinically equivalent to FDA-approved CSF tests in classifying Aβ PET status, with an area under the curve (AUC) for both between 0.95 and 0.97. Plasma %p-tau217 was generally superior to CSF tests in classification of tau-PET with AUCs of 0.95–0.98. In cognitively impaired subcohorts (BioFINDER-2: n = 720; Knight ADRC: n = 50), plasma %p-tau217 had an accuracy, a positive predictive value and a negative predictive value of 89–90% for Aβ PET and 87–88% for tau PET status, which was clinically equivalent to CSF tests, further improving to 95% using a two-cutoffs approach. Blood plasma %p-tau217 demonstrated performance that was clinically equivalent or superior to clinically used FDA-approved CSF tests in the detection of AD pathology. Use of high-performance blood tests in clinical practice can improve access to accurate AD diagnosis and AD-specific treatments.

### Disease staging of Alzheimer's disease using a CSF-based biomarker model [^eed18233]. Nature Aging (2024). High credibility.

For Knight ADRC, we followed the same main approach. We first started with seven biomarkers and tested the optimal number of subtypes, which was, again, one (CVIC: subtype 1 = 629.5, subtype 2 = 649.4, subtype 3 = 658.4, log-likelihood: subtype 1 = −32.3, subtype 2 = −33.3, subtype 3 = −33.8; Supplementary Fig. 10a). Then, given the high overlap between biomarkers, we tested removing pT217/T217, pT231/T231 and/or pT181/T181 again. Based on CVIC (model 1: 629.5, model 2: 590.1, model 3: 564.6, model 4: 567.1, model 5: 520.7, model 6: 524.0 and model 7: 497.2) and log-likelihood (median: model 1: −31.8, model 2: −29.8, model 3: −28.1, model 4: −28.4, model 5: −25.9, model 6: −26.1 and model 7: −24.8) metrics, the model with only pT217/T217 (model 7) was again selected as the optimal (Supplementary Fig. 10b). Finally, we created models for 1–3 subtypes and based on CVIC (subtypes: 1 = 497.2, 2 = 524.5 and 3 = 550.6) and log-likelihood (median: 1 = −24.8, 2 = −27.0 and 3 = −28.3), and the less complex model (that is, one subtype) was selected as the best fit to the data (Supplementary Fig. 10c). We then staged all Knight ADRC participants based on this cross-validated model. As a sensitivity analysis, we also used the model created with BioFINDER-2 data and applied to the Knight ADRC cohort instead of creating the model in the Knight ADRC cohort. Very similar results were found, with 213 of 222 participants (96%) assigned to the same stage as when we fitted the model on the Knight ADRC data. Of note, all nine cases changed from CSF stage 5 (creating the model in Knight ADRC) to CSF stage 4 (using BioFINDER-2 model). This change may be due to the lower severity of Knight ADRC participants compared to those in BioFINDER-2, as they all had the lowest np-tau levels in CSF stage 5.

### Epigenetic clocks for gestational age: statistical and study design considerations [^873b9eba]. Clinical Epigenetics (2017). Low credibility.

Given the much lower correlation of the Knight compared to the Bohlin estimate in ARIES, we asked if the difference could be due to differences between their training datasets: GA measured using ultrasound (Bohlin) versus last menstrual period (Knight), mean GA (Bohlin 39.9; Knight 36.9), training samples (1068 for Bohlin; 207 for Knight), 450K CpG sites (Bohlin) versus 27K CpG sites (Knight). Most of these predict that Bohlin will perform best in an average population like ARIES. We did, however, wonder if the Knight clock performance could have been improved had more training samples been used. Whereas the Knight training dataset consisted of six cohorts with 207 samples, the testing dataset consisted of > 1000 samples. We also wondered if the Knight clock consisting of nearly as many CpG sites (148) as training samples (207) might have suffered from overfitting.

To explore these concerns, we derived a new GA clock by fitting elastic nets implementing in the glmnet R package to the publicly available subset of the Knight testing and training data restricted to the same 27K CpG sites (total n = 400; GSE36642 n = 51; GSE62924 n = 38; GSE79056 n = 36; GSE80310 n = 24; GSE66459 n = 22; GSE69633 n = 46; VICS n = 183). The resulting clock included 193 CpG sites, and its correlation with GA in ARIES was quite similar to the Knight estimate (R = 0.56). Both the original Knight clock and our new clock were correlated with measured GA (R = 0.37) and with the Bohlin estimate at similar strength (R = 0.49). Both GAA estimates were also similar (R = 0.49) and were correlated with the Bohlin GAA estimate at similar strength (R = 0.35). However, the new GAA estimate was more strongly correlated with birth weight (R = 0.09; p = 0.008) compared to the Knight estimate (R = 0.055, p = 0.11).

### Evaluation of pediatric epigenetic clocks across multiple tissues [^5b5b1995]. Clinical Epigenetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Gestational age (GA) prediction in blood samples collected at birth

We assessed the performance of the Knight and Bohlin clocks, in three types of blood samples (cord blood, CBMC, and blood spot) collected at birth, stratified by array type and gestational age at birth category (term [> 37 weeks] or preterm [< 37 weeks]). The Bohlin clock consistently shows less variation in terms of age acceleration residuals (Table 2).

In cord blood DNA, the Bohlin clock GA was more correlated with observed GA than the Knight clock across all three array types (Table 2). The median error for the Knight clock was consistently around 1 week across array types, whereas the Bohlin clock exhibited varied median errors, with the lowest at 0.58 week in the 27K array, 1.10 weeks in the 450K array, and the largest at 1.64 weeks in the EPIC array. Similar trends were observed for mean difference, with the Knight clock consistently underestimating GA, typically resulting in predictions 0.5 weeks less than observed GA. The Bohlin clock had a mean difference of − 0.31 week for the 27K array, − 0.99 week for the 450K array, and − 1.41 weeks for the EPIC array.

In CBMC DNA using the EPIC array, the Bohlin clock showed a higher correlation with observed GA than the Knight clock (0.66 vs. 0.38), with smaller median error (1.73 vs. 2.02 weeks), median residual (0.35 vs. 0.83 week) and mean difference (− 1.56 vs. − 1.90 weeks).

In blood spot DNA, the Bohlin clock GA showed stronger correlation with the observed GA than the Knight clock using the 450K and EPIC arrays (0.47 and 0.65 for Bohlin vs. 0.35 and 0.48 for Knight, Table 2). The median errors were around 1 week for both clocks in 450K data, but the Knight clock had a smaller median error than Bohlin clock for EPIC array data (0.89 vs. 1.42 weeks). The Knight clock also had smaller mean difference estimates than the Bohlin clock for both 450K (− 0.082 vs. − 0.94 week) and EPIC array data (− 0.32 vs. − 1.35 weeks).

### Baseline microglial activation correlates with brain amyloidosis and longitudinal cognitive decline in Alzheimer disease [^67fbf536]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Cognitive Measures

As a measure of cognitive performance, we used the Knight ADRC Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (Knight ADRC-PACC) score and a global composite score for each individual from the Knight ADRC cognitive battery. Consistent with previously published methods, the Knight ADRC-PACC score was calculated by averaging the z score across 5 cognitive tests measuring memory, attention, and processing speed. The cognitive tests were performed annually for each individual. Specifically, the included tests were MMSE, the Digit Symbol subtask of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, the animal naming test, the associate learning summary score from the Wechsler memory scale, and the free and cued selective reminding test. The global score was derived by averaging the z score for each individual across all common tasks collected by the neuropsychologic battery of the Knight ADRC. In addition to the tasks described earlier, the global score also included the Trail A and Trail B subtasks of the trail making test, the Boston naming test, the summary score of the crossing-off task, the mental control subtask of the Wechsler Memory Scale, the summary score for the S & P word fluency task, the digit span forward and backward subtasks of the revised Wechsler Memory Scale, and the information and block subtasks of the Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale. The resulting Knight ADRC-PACC and global scores were used as measures of specific and overall cognitive performance in subsequent analyses, respectively. The baseline cognitive scores used the cognitive assessment closest to the TSPO PET scan (all were within 1 year).

APOE Genotyping

DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples by standard procedures. APOE genotyping was performed as previously described. Individuals carrying at least 1 APOE ε4 allele were classified as APOE ε4 positive (APOE ε4+).

### Effects of maternal vitamin D3 supplementation on offspring epigenetic clock of gestational age at birth: a post-hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial [^e45972fb]. Epigenetics (2020). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D could be beneficial for healthy ageing in humans. We previously found that vitamin D supplementation may slow down epigenetic ageing in young African American adults. We tested new epigenetic clocks developed for neonates among a multiethnic population, and tested the hypothesis that maternal vitamin D supplementation would slow down the epigenetic gestational age acceleration (GAA) in newborn babies. Ninety-two pregnant women (aged 29.6 ± 4.8 y; 21% African Americans, 28% Hispanics) were randomized to receive 4000 IU/day vitamin D 3 or placebo, plus prenatal vitamins containing 400 IU vitamin D 3 during pregnancy in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Cord blood genome-wide methylation analysis was performed on the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC Beadchip. DNA methylation gestational age was calculated based on two calculations developed by Knight and Bohlin. DNA methylation gestational ages calculated by Knight's clock and Bohlin' clock were highly correlated with the gestational age in the placebo group (correlation coefficients = 0.88, p s < 0.001, respectively). GAA was associated with higher birth weight (p = 0.039). In the entire cohort, vitamin D 3 supplementation was not associated with GAA (p > 0.05). However, vitamin D 3 supplementation decreased GAA by both Knight's clock (β = -0.89, p = 0.047) and Bohlin's clock (β = -0.71, p = 0.005) in the African American participants. Maternal vitamin D 3 supplementation may slow down the epigenetic gestational ageing process in African American neonates. Long-term follow-up studies are warranted to determine the role of epigenetic age acceleration in the growth and development of offspring.

### Associations of circulating folate, vitamin B12 and homocysteine concentrations in early pregnancy and cord blood with epigenetic gestational age: the generation R study [^4d07a962]. Clinical Epigenetics (2021). Medium credibility.

Our findings differed slightly between the two epigenetic clocks. However, the effect size of the association of higher maternal plasma homocysteine concentrations with positive gestational age acceleration was the same for both Bohlin's and Knight's epigenetic clock. In contrast, for the associations of higher cord serum vitamin B12 concentrations with negative raw gestational age acceleration, observed for Knight's epigenetic clock in the subgroup with optimal pregnancy dating, the effect estimates were 30% smaller when using Bohlin's epigenetic clock. A recent study examined associations of vitamin D supplementation with gestational age acceleration and found similar results using both Bohlin's and Knight's epigenetic clock. However, the authors also reported differences between the two epigenetic clocks and their associations with exposures during pregnancy. Only gestational age acceleration based on Bohlin's epigenetic clock was associated with higher maternal BMI and higher birth weight, whereas only gestational age acceleration based on Knight's epigenetic clock was associated with child sex. Differences in findings, depending on which epigenetic clock is used, could result from the resemblance of the study population under investigation with the training datasets used to develop either Bohlin's or Knight's epigenetic clock. In our full population, newborns were comparable to the newborns in which the Bohlin clock was developed, being from European ethnicity and with similar mean clinical gestational age of 39.9 weeks. In contrast, the training dataset used to develop Knight's epigenetic clock was of mixed ethnic background and characterized by a younger mean clinical gestational age of 36.9 weeks, which was estimated based on LMP, similar to the included newborns in our subgroup analysis. In line with this, in our full population, the correlation between clinical and DNA methylation gestational age was higher when based on Bohlin's epigenetic clock, as compared to Knight's epigenetic clock. This suggests that epigenetic age estimated by Bohlin's epigenetic clock may be more accurate than epigenetic age estimated by Knight's epigenetic clock in our population. In the subgroup with optimal pregnancy dating based on LMP, the correlation with Knight's epigenetic clock increased slightly, potentially because clinical gestational age was estimated similarly. An alternative explanation for differences between findings based on the used epigenetic clock may be that Bohlin's and Knight's epigenetic clock contain different CpGs, which may be indicative of different aspects of accelerated aging. Only one CpG (cg05365729) overlaps between the epigenetic clocks of Bohlin and Knight. We did not observe any associations for plasma folate concentrations. None of the differentially methylated CpGs in the previously published meta-analysis of EWASs on maternal folate concentrations were included in either Bohlin's or Knight's epigenetic clock. Variation in plasma folate concentrations may thus not be reflected in epigenetic accelerated gestational aging. A different explanation could be that folate may be associated with differential DNA methylation at specific CpGs, but not with DNA methylation changes relevant for accelerated aging. Both our findings for circulating homocysteine and vitamin B12 concentrations, and the null results for circulating folate concentrations, require further replication.

### Unconventional superconductivity in PuCoGa5 [^9248cfad]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

In the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconductivity, electrons form (Cooper) pairs through an interaction mediated by vibrations in the underlying crystal structure. Like lattice vibrations, antiferromagnetic fluctuations can also produce an attractive interaction creating Cooper pairs, though with spin and angular momentum properties different from those of conventional superconductors. Such interactions have been implicated for two disparate classes of materials — the copper oxides and a set of Ce- and U-based compounds. But because their transition temperatures differ by nearly two orders of magnitude, this raises the question of whether a common pairing mechanism applies. PuCoGa5 has a transition temperature intermediate between those classes and therefore may bridge these extremes. Here we report measurements of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate and Knight shift in PuCoGa5, which demonstrate that it is an unconventional superconductor with properties as expected for antiferromagnetically mediated superconductivity. Scaling of the relaxation rates among all of these materials (a feature not exhibited by their Knight shifts) establishes antiferromagnetic fluctuations as a likely mechanism for their unconventional superconductivity and suggests that related classes of exotic superconductors may yet be discovered.

Comparison of DNAm GA estimates from the Bohlin and Knight clocks

Figure 2 shows the relationship between the DNAm GA estimates from the two clocks across the same methylation array. As estimated with the 450K DNA methylation array, DNAm GA from the Knight clock was strongly correlated with DNAm GA from the Bohlin clock (r = 0.81, p < 2.2x10 −16) (Figure 2a). Similarly, in the subsample with EPIC array measurements, DNAm GA from the Knight clock was strongly correlated with DNAm GA from the Bohlin clock (r = 0.71, p < 2.2x10 −16) (Figure 2b). GAA derived from both clocks was also found to be highly correlated (r = 0.76, p < 2.2x10 −16) (Figure 5).

### Maternal depression and adverse neighbourhood conditions during pregnancy are associated with gestational epigenetic age deceleration [^c68b28b2]. Epigenetics (2022). Medium credibility.

To facilitate comparisons with prior studies in this area, we calculated the Knight clock to quantify epigenetic ageing at birth. Specifically, gestational epigenetic age was calculated according to the procedures developed by Horvath and adapted by Knight et al. The Knight clock was developed specifically for use in umbilical cord blood and reflects a weighted average of methylation beta values at 148 CpG sites. Seven of the 148 Knight clock probes are not assayed on the Illumina EPIC Infinium array. We, therefore, calculated Knight epigenetic age with the remaining 141 probes. Previous research has shown that DNAm age estimates derived with the EPIC array were robust to missing probes compared to other platforms. Moreover, in sensitivity analyses, we likewise found that calculated ages were robust to the removal of the seven probes not included on the EPIC array using the example data provided by Knight et al. (data not shown). In the present study, gestational epigenetic age acceleration and deceleration reflected the arithmetic difference between DNAm estimated gestational age and chronological gestational age estimated clinically from ultrasound. We used this difference variable in analysis. This difference variable was also used in the initial study of maternal depression and gestational epigenetic age deceleration; we use it here to facilitate comparisons of results across study populations. Analyses were repeated using a residualized gestational epigenetic age acceleration variable. As results were essentially the same (data not shown), we report on findings with the difference score.

### Simulation of the NMR response in the pseudogap regime of the cuprates [^b55f0c90]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

The pseudogap in the cuprate high-temperature superconductors was discovered as a suppression of the Knight shift and spin relaxation time measured in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments. However, theoretical understanding of this suppression in terms of the magnetic susceptiblility of correlated itinerant fermion systems was so far lacking. Here we study the temperature and doping evolution of these quantities on the two-dimensional Hubbard model using cluster dynamical mean field theory. We recover the suppression of the Knight shift and the linear-in-T spin echo decay that increases with doping. The relaxation rate shows a marked increase as T is lowered but no indication of a pseudogap on the Cu site, and a clear downturn on the O site, consistent with experimental results on single layer materials but different from double layer materials. The consistency of these results with experiment suggests that the pseudogap is well described by strong short-range correlation effects.

### Epigenetic gestational age acceleration: a prospective cohort study investigating associations with familial, sociodemographic and birth characteristics [^b12e2620]. Clinical Epigenetics (2018). Low credibility.

Another explanation for the discrepancies between our findings and the findings of Girchenko et al. is their use of the Knight et al. GA prediction model rather than the Bohlin et al. model applied in this study. We have previously noted several key methodological differences in the derivation of the Knight et al. and the Bohlin et al. models that influence the accuracy of the GA prediction in this cohort, such as the inclusion of preterm infants in the test set of the Knight et al. model which is inappropriate for a data set with few pre-term births (as in this study). Additionally, the number of CpGs (148) included in the Knight et al. training model was close to the sample size of the training set (207) and the model was then tested with a much larger sample size which may have resulted in an overfitting of the model. In contrast, the number of CpGs (96) in the Bohlin et al. training model was much lower than the sample size of the training set (1068). Thus, the Bohlin et al. model provided us with the best estimate of GAA for this cohort, which was reflected in the stronger correlation found between reported GA in the ARIES cohort and the model predictions of GA compared to the Knight et al. model. The Bohlin et al. model for prediction of GA from DNAm performed well in our data, adding support to the notion that DNAm could potentially be used as a marker of GA in data sets where GA has not been measured.

### Prenatal and birth associations of epigenetic gestational age acceleration in the center for the health assessment of mothers and children of salinas (CHAMACOS) cohort [^fda34a77]. Epigenetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Gestational age (GA) is an important determinant of child health and disease risk. Two epigenetic GA clocks have been developed using DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns in cord blood. We investigate the accuracy of GA clocks and determinants of epigenetic GA acceleration (GAA), a biomarker of biological ageing. We hypothesize that prenatal and birth characteristics are associated with altered GAA, thereby disrupting foetal biological ageing. We examined 372 mother-child pairs from the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas study of primarily Latino farmworkers in California. Chronological GA was robustly correlated with epigenetic GA (DNAm GA) estimated by the Knight (r = 0.48, p < 2.2x10 -16) and Bohlin clocks (r = 0.67, p < 2.2x10 -16) using the Illumina 450K array in cord blood samples collected at birth. GA clock performance was robust, though slightly lower, using DNAm profiles from the Illumina EPIC array in a smaller subsample (Knight: r = 0.39, p < 3.5x10 -5; Bohlin: r = 0.60, p < 7.7x10 -12). After adjusting for confounders, high maternal serum triglyceride levels (Bohlin: β = -0.01 days per mg/dL, p = 0.03), high maternal serum lipid levels (Bohlin: β = -4.31x10 -3 days per mg/dL, p = 0.04), preterm delivery (Bohlin: β = -4.03 days, p = 9.64x10 -4), greater maternal parity (Knight: β = -4.07 days, p = 0.01; Bohlin: β = -2.43 days, p = 0.01), and male infant sex (Knight: β = -3.15 days, p = 3.10x10 -3) were associated with decreased GAA. Prenatal and birth characteristics affect GAA in newborns. Understanding factors that accelerate or delay biological ageing at birth may identify early-life targets for disease prevention and improve ageing across the life-course. Future research should test the impact of altered GAA on the long-term burden of age-related diseases.

### Prenatal and birth associations of epigenetic gestational age acceleration in the center for the health assessment of mothers and children of salinas (CHAMACOS) cohort [^51c3f2e8]. Epigenetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Consistent with findings from Simpkin et al. and Dieckmann et al. we also demonstrate that the Bohlin clock predicted GA with a higher accuracy compared to the Knight clock using DNAm data from both the 450K and EPIC arrays. The Bohlin clock also resulted in predictions that had a lower median absolute error compared to the Knight clock. Even though only two CpGs (cg07816074, cg16536918) overlap between the Knight and Bohlin epigenetic clocks, we observed strong correlations (r > 0.7) between DNAm GA estimates from both clocks across the 450K and EPIC arrays. Consistently, the residual GAA estimates as determined by both clocks were found to be highly correlated, supporting that both clocks are measuring biological gestational age by leveraging different changes that occur in the human genome from conception to birth. This suggests that while both clocks reflect foetal development timing, they might differ in their biological insight by utilizing methylation of different sets of genes. Indeed, associations with sex were only captured by Knight's GAA and not Bohlin's GAA. Our results suggest that the greater accuracy of the Bohlin clock makes it more sensitive to detect associations, including those related to the external environment (i.e. triglycerides and lipids), while the Knight clock might be able to capture biological influences such as parity and sex. However, this needs further confirmation in other cohorts.

### Baseline microglial activation correlates with brain amyloidosis and longitudinal cognitive decline in Alzheimer disease [^e41b6762]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

This study aims to quantify microglial activation in individuals with Alzheimer disease (AD) using the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) PET imaging in the hippocampus and precuneus, the 2 AD-vulnerable regions, and to evaluate the association of baseline neuroinflammation with amyloidosis, tau, and longitudinal cognitive decline.

Methods

Twenty-four participants from the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (Knight ADRC) were enrolled and classified into stable cognitively normal, progressor, and symptomatic AD groups based on clinical dementia rating (CDR) at 2 or more clinical assessments. The baseline TSPO radiotracer [11C]PK11195 was used to image microglial activation. Baseline CSF concentrations of Aβ42, Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, tau phosphorylated at position 181 (p-tau181), and total tau (t-tau) were measured. Clinical and cognitive decline were examined with longitudinal CDR and cognitive composite scores (Global and Knight ADRC-Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite [Knight ADRC-PACC] Score).

Results

Participants in the progressor and symptomatic AD groups had significantly elevated [11C]PK11195 standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) in the hippocampus but not in the precuneus region. In the subcohort with CSF biomarkers (16 of the 24), significant negative correlations between CSF Aβ42 or Aβ42/Aβ40 and [11C]PK11195 SUVR were observed in the hippocampus and precuneus. No correlations were observed between [11C]PK11195 SUVR and CSF p-tau181 or t-tau at baseline in those regions. Higher baseline [11C]PK11195 SUVR averaged in the whole cortical regions predicted longitudinal decline on cognitive tests.

Discussion

Microglial activation is increased in individuals with brain amyloidosis and predicts worsening cognition in AD.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class II evidence that in patients with AD, higher baseline [11C]PK11195 SUVR averaged in the whole cortical regions was associated with longitudinal decline on cognitive tests.

### DNA methylation age at birth and childhood: performance of epigenetic clocks and characteristics associated with epigenetic age acceleration in the project viva cohort [^255b93ac]. Clinical Epigenetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study aimed to evaluate the performance and identify biological and sociodemographic correlates of two EGA clocks and two pan- or multi-tissue EA clocks at birth and during follow-up at two timepoints in childhood in the Project Viva pre-birth cohort. Estimates of Horvath and skin & blood EA were close to 0 years at birth, but weakly correlated with chronological GA. However, Horvath and skin & blood EA were moderately correlated with chronological age in early and mid-childhood. We observed significant associations between maternal-child characteristics and EAA, although relationships varied across clocks and ages. Maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with higher skin & blood EAA at birth and in early childhood. Child sex was most consistently associated with differential EGAA (female newborns having lower Bohlin EGAA) and EAA (female newborns and children having lower Horvath EAA). Associations of child race/ethnicity with EAA were also identified across clocks.

Bohlin and Knight EGA were significantly correlated with chronological GA at birth; however, Bohlin EGA had notably higher correlation (N = 485; Bohlin r Pearson = 0.82 vs. Knight r Pearson = 0.58) and lower MAE (Bohlin MAE = 0.70 vs. Knight MAE = 1.07 weeks) relative to chronological GA. This observation is consistent with previous studies demonstrating better prediction of GA at birth using Bohlin EGA compared to Knight EGA. Several factors in the development of the Knight clock may contribute to its lower performance, including training on GA determined by a combination of LMP, ultrasound, and clinician report and potential overfitting due to the high ratio of CpGs included in this clock to training samples. It should also be noted that although the development of the Knight clock included newborns of multiple ancestries, the training datasets included in both the Bohlin and Knight clocks were from predominantly White populations, which may have affected performance among newborns in other race/ethnicity groups in our study.

### An atlas of cortical circular RNA expression in Alzheimer disease brains demonstrates clinical and pathological associations [^978bd873]. Nature Neuroscience (2019). High credibility.

Parietal cortex RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data were generated from individuals with and without Alzheimer disease (AD; n control = 13; n AD = 83) from the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (Knight ADRC). Using this and an independent (Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB)) AD RNA-seq dataset, cortical circular RNA (circRNA) expression was quantified in the context of AD. Significant associations were identified between circRNA expression and AD diagnosis, clinical dementia severity and neuropathological severity. It was demonstrated that most circRNA-AD associations are independent of changes in cognate linear messenger RNA expression or estimated brain cell-type proportions. Evidence was provided for circRNA expression changes occurring early in presymptomatic AD and in autosomal dominant AD. It was also observed that AD-associated circRNAs co-expressed with known AD genes. Finally, potential microRNA-binding sites were identified in AD-associated circRNAs for miRNAs predicted to target AD genes. Together, these results highlight the importance of analyzing non-linear RNAs and support future studies exploring the potential roles of circRNAs in AD pathogenesis.

2.2 T1‐weighted MRI imaging

2.2.1 Image acquisition

ADNI participants included in our analysis underwent T1‐weighted MRI imaging using 3T MRI scanners (details are available online). KnightADRC participants underwent T1‐weighted MRI imaging using the Siemens Biograph mMR 3T scanner. Detailed information about MRI image acquisition for the Knight ADRC dataset can be found in the Supplementary Methods (SM1.1).

2.2.2 Image pre‐processing

The T1‐weighted sequences from ADNI and Knight ADRC were pre‐processed using FreeSurfer versions 6 and 5.3, respectively. The cortical surface of each hemisphere was parcellated according to the Desikan–Killiany atlasand anatomical region of interest (ROI) measures were obtained via a whole‐brain segmentation procedure (Aseg atlas). The final data included in our analyses (both ADNI and Knight ADRC) included pre‐processed regional grey matter volumes of 66 cortical ROIs (33 per hemisphere) and 24 subcortical ROIs for each participant. All ROI volumes were normalized by the intracranial volume (ICV). Detailed MRI pre‐processing protocols for ADNI are available online. Further information about MRI processing protocols for the Knight ADRC dataset can be found in the Supplementary Methods (SM1.2). As a summary metric of MRI atrophy, hippocampal volume was calculated independently for ADNI and Knight ADRC by averaging hippocampal volumes across the left and right hemispheres and subsequently normalized by the ICV.

2.3 Amyloid and tau PET imaging

2.3.1 Image acquisition

ADNI participants underwent amyloid‐PET imaging with either [18 F]‐Florbetapir (FBP) or [18 F]‐Florbetaben (FBB) tracers and tau‐PET imaging with [18 F]‐Flortaucipir (FTP). Details regarding PET acquisition for ADNI are available online. Knight ADRC participants underwent amyloid‐PET imaging with either FBP or [11 C]‐Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB). Tau‐PET imaging was performed using FTP. Further information about PET image acquisition for the Knight ADRC can be found in the Supplementary Methods (SM2.1). To avoid harmonization issues due to multiple tracers, we only included data collected using FBP in our analyses for both ADNI and Knight ADRC.

### Feasibility of 2-point fixation by absorbable plates using the transoral approach in management of the zygomatic complex fractures [^dd48a820]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the feasibility of 2-point fixation using absorbable plates by the transoral approach in the management of the zygomatic complex (ZMC) fractures.

Methods

Twenty-five patients (15 male and 10 female, age range 16 y to 55 y) with Knight and North Group Ⅲ zygomatic fractures were included in this case series. Open reduction by intraoral approach was performed on these patients, and the fractures were fixed using absorbable plates placed at the zygomaticomaxillary buttress and infraorbital rim. Postoperatively, follow-up was undertaken to evaluate the fracture healing, mouth opening, facial asymmetry, diplopia, and paresthesia.

Results

Postoperatively, all patients achieved uneventful healing; facial symmetry and wound healing were achieved, along with sensory recovery involving the infraorbital nerve. Complications such as sensory disturbances, infection, diplopia, malunion, and nonunion were not encountered in these patients.

Conclusions

Two-point fixation using absorbable plates by transoral approach can provide sufficient stabilization for Knight and North Group III zygomatic fractures.

### Knobloch syndrome associated with polymicrogyria and early onset of retinal detachment: two case reports [^9642555a]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Knobloch Syndrome (KS) is a rare autosomal recessive syndrome first described in 1971 characterized by vitreoretinal degeneration and occipital skull abnormalities. Clinical heterogeneity is present, although virtually all patients have ocular abnormalities that typically result in bilateral loss of vision. Ophthalmic findings include retinal detachment (RD), high myopia, early-onset cataracts, pigment dispersion, congenital glaucoma, and lens subluxation.

Midline occipital defects, namely bone defects, encephalocele, or aplasia cutis congenita, are characteristic findings. Other central nervous system findings are overall rare and not considered to be stereotypic features of KS. Caglayan et al. review seven cases of patients with KS associated with other central nervous system findings including pachygyria, polymicrogyria and cerebellar atrophy among other findings. Developmental delay is observed in only a minority of patients, although is observed more frequently in patients who also possess central nervous system abnormalities. Other less common findings include seizures, hyperextensibility of joints, lung hypoplasia, cardiac dextroversion, midface hypoplasia, flat nasal bridge, and duplicated renal collecting system observed in single families.

The causative gene in KS has been identified as COL18A1, which encodes for collagen type XVIII α-1 chain. It is ubiquitously expressed in vascular and epithelial basement membranes and has multiple functions in ocular and neurologic development including maintenance of the basement membrane, cell proliferation, and angiogenesis.

Herein, we describe two siblings with KS associated with polymicrogyria, an anomaly sporadically associated with KS. Polymicrogyria is a condition characterized by multiple small gyri leading to an abnormally thick cerebral cortex. It presents with variety of clinical symptoms dependent on the specific region of the brain that is affected, although seizures and developmental delay are commonly described. Our first case is also noteworthy as the patient presented with a RD at only 7-months-old, which to our knowledge is the second youngest age reported to date in a patient with KS. We then briefly describe potentially promising treatment options for KS.

### Associations of circulating folate, vitamin B12 and homocysteine concentrations in early pregnancy and cord blood with epigenetic gestational age: the generation R study [^f0ac159b]. Clinical Epigenetics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Circulating folate, vitamin B12 and homocysteine concentrations during fetal development have been associated with health outcomes in childhood. Changes in fetal DNA methylation may be an underlying mechanism. This may be reflected in altered epigenetic aging of the fetus, as compared to chronological aging. The difference between gestational age derived in clinical practice and gestational age predicted from neonatal DNA methylation data is referred to as gestational age acceleration. Differences in circulating folate, vitamin B12 and homocysteine concentrations during fetal development may be associated with gestational age acceleration.

Results

Up to 1346 newborns participating in the Generation R Study, a population-based prospective cohort study, had both cord blood DNA methylation data available and information on plasma folate, serum total and active B12 and plasma homocysteine concentrations, measured in early pregnancy and/or in cord blood. A subgroup of 380 newborns had mothers with optimal pregnancy dating based on a regular menstrual cycle and a known date of last menstrual period. For comparison, gestational age acceleration was calculated based the method of both Bohlin and Knight. In the total study population, which was more similar to Bohlin's training population, one standard deviation score (SDS) higher maternal plasma homocysteine concentrations was nominally associated with positive gestational age acceleration [0.07 weeks, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02, 0.13] by Bohlin's method. In the subgroup with pregnancy dating based on last menstrual period, the method that was also used in Knight's training population, one SDS higher cord serum total and active B12 concentrations were nominally associated with negative gestational age acceleration [(-0.16 weeks, 95% CI -0.30, -0.02) and (-0.15 weeks, 95% CI -0.29, -0.01), respectively] by Knight's method.

Conclusions

We found some evidence to support associations of higher maternal plasma homocysteine concentrations with positive gestational age acceleration, suggesting faster epigenetic than clinical gestational aging. Cord serum vitamin B12 concentrations may be associated with negative gestational age acceleration, indicating slower epigenetic than clinical gestational aging. Future studies could examine whether altered fetal epigenetic aging underlies the associations of circulating homocysteine and vitamin B12 blood concentrations during fetal development with long-term health outcomes.

### Stability selection enhances feature selection and enables accurate prediction of gestational age using only five DNA methylation sites [^5053e1f9]. Clinical Epigenetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Most of the CpGs selected in GA clocks are not stably predictive of GA

To investigate the stability of CpGs selected for GA prediction in previously published GA clocks, we examined three different cord-blood-based epigenetic GA clocks: (i) the 'Haftorn clock,' based on EPIC samples, (ii) the 'Bohlin clock,' based on 450 K samples and (iii) the 'Knight clock,' based on 450 K and 27 K samples. In total, 389 unique CpGs in our analyses were previously selected in GA clocks; specifically, 176 in the Haftorn clock, 86 in the Bohlin clock, and 140 in the Knight clock. Of these CpGs, two were in common between the Knight and the Bohlin clock, and 11 were in common between the Bohlin and the Haftorn clock. There were no shared CpGs between the Knight and the Haftorn clock. Eighteen (10.2%) of the Haftorn clock CpGs (Fig. 2 a) and eight (9.3%) of the Bohlin clock CpGs (Fig. 2 b) were found to be stably predictive of GA. By contrast, none of the Knight clock CpGs were found to be stably predictive of GA (Fig. 2 c). Interestingly, four of the CpGs identified as being stably predictive of GA, notably cg03540917, cg15393909, cg20320200 and cg20734092, were not selected by any of the above GA clocks.

At the start of the 20th century, 15% of all infants in England and Wales died in the first year of life. Newman's classic work Infant mortality, published in 1906, identified the causes of these deaths, the significance of the period immediately after birth, the social problems underlying mortality, and possible methods of prevention. Later, as chief medical officer to the Board of Education (1907–1935) and to the Ministry of Health (1919–1935), he achieved many important and wide ranging improvements to the health of infants and children.

### 2, 500-year evolution of the term epidemic [^4c2771e9]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

In Epidemics, books I and III constitute lists of diseases describing clinical cases. Hippocrates compared these cases and grouped them to generate series of similar cases. He adopted a classification approach, initially seeking clinical similarities between cases, thereby discovering, in addition to the notion of epidemic, the more fundamental concepts of symptom and syndrome. However, Hippocrates believed that prognosis was a major aspect of medicine. This belief led him to consider disease a dynamic process with its own progression, a temporal dimension, that represents a first nosologic evolution: syndromic groupings become diseases. Another of the books written by the physician from Kos — Airs, Waters, and Places — deals with the relationships between diseases and the environment, focusing particularly on the habitat of the patients and the season in which disease occurs. Hippocrates tried to determine the effect of environmental factors on what could be described as the distribution of diseases. He was, thus, more concerned about grouping together winter diseases or autumn diseases or diseases that occurred in a particular place or in persons whose way of life had changed than in identifying a large number of cases of the same disease in winter or autumn, at a particular place, or in association with a particular way of life. For Hippocrates, whose nosologic approach already contained a major element of preoccupation with the environment, the first meaning of epidemic was groups of cases resembling each other clinically and the second meaning was groups of different diseases occurring at the same place or in the same season and sometimes spreading "on the people". Thus, Hippocrates applied the word epidemios to groupings of syndromes or diseases, with reference to atmospheric characteristics, seasons or geography, and sometimes propagation of a given syndrome in the human population.

Already in his lifetime, Carl Rokitansky was celebrated as the "pioneer of modern pathology". It was he, more than anybody else, who launched the era of morphology in medicine. Close correlation between findings uncovered at autopsy and clinical signs and symptoms helped to shape the view of diseases as distinct pathologic processes, rather than accidental constellations of findings. On the occasion of his 200 birthday, this review describes the life and work of Rokitansky, including his discoveries, misconceptions, and contributions to dermatopathology.

### Jared diamond confidential [^3909969e]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Sometime after a trip to New Guinea in 1972, perhaps the world's most noted ornithologist-physiologist-turned-evolutionary biologist and biogeographer set about "the modest task of trying to explain the broad pattern of human history, on all the continents, for the last 13,000 years." In 1998, Guns, Germs, and Steel won the Pulitzer Prize.

The book's thesis, in short, is that specific geographic factors tipped the balance at the dawn of civilization. In Eurasia, which was blessed with many plants and animals suitable for domestication, geography fueled the rise of agriculture, which in turn allowed human communities to grow and differentiate into leaders, workers, and inventors. Exposure to domesticated animals' germs also buttressed Eurasians' defenses against potentially lethal infections. For these reasons, Diamond asserts, the people of the Fertile Crescent and their descendants more rapidly advanced and ultimately conquered the indigenous people of Africa, the New World, Australia, and the South Pacific. At the same time it explains global disparities, Guns, Germs, and Steel also refutes the notion that any given race is biologically or intellectually superior to another.

### Darwin on race, gender, and culture [^7264f3d1]. The American Psychologist (2009). Low credibility.

Darwin's theories of natural selection and sexual selection are significant scientific achievements, although his understanding of race and gender was defined and limited by his own life circumstances and the sociohistorical context within which he worked. This article considers the ways in which race, gender, and culture were represented and explained by Darwin and the ways in which his observations and opinions on gender and race were taken up by others and, more often than not, misapplied. Whereas the challenge of race (for Darwin) was to demonstrate the fundamental similarity and, hence, the common origin, of human races, the challenge of gender (for Darwin) was to identify a mechanism that could account for differences between women and men that, to him, were obvious, fundamental, and significant. The article concludes by considering the implications of Darwin's views for contemporary scientific psychology.

### Anticipating deep autumn: a widening lens [^db26c285]. Medical Humanities (2002). Low credibility.

Medicine has become one of the most powerful influences of the twentieth century, and currently dominates how we approach and think about another powerful phenomenon: the aging of the world's population. Our reliance on the medical model, with its focus on pathology, physiology, and biomedical interventions, makes it difficult for aging men and women and those in the health care field who care for them to seek alternative ways to attach meaning to the process of growing old. This article explores the role of the humanities as an alternative to the biomedical model which can enlarge our abilities to see the multidimensional aspects of aging. Age related writings and visual images by Kenyon, Neel, Olds, Valadon, and Hemingway are discussed to illustrate how fictive representations can and do serve as a moral impetus or stimulus for meaningful reflection about life stages that have not yet been experienced.

The Himalaya, "abode of snow," dominates the landscape of Nepal. Home of the highest peaks in the world, including Mount Everest, the country is traversed and bound by the massive range. "In a hundred ages of the gods, I could not tell thee of the glories of the Himalaya," elegize Hindu texts. A barrier to the movement of people for thousands of years, the slopes, glaciers, rivers, and lakes associated with the range discouraged outside interference and military adventures. In the remote gorges, valleys, and high plateaus, flourished instead the individual and unique cultures of a diverse population.

Landlocked in the south by India, the north by Tibet, present-day Nepal historically comprised the kingdoms of the Kathmandu Valley. At the crossroads of trade and multiple religious traditions (Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism), the valley became a shared sacred site, a focus of social and cultural exchange, and the creative locus of much Himalayan art. The symbiosis of Hinduism and Buddhism is reflected in the art of the indigenous Newar.

When famed Chinese envoy Wang Hsüan-tse visited Nepal in the 7th century, he wrote with admiration of the metalwork in King Narendradeva's palace in Kathmandu and mentioned the king's elaborate belt decorated with golden images of Buddha. He also noted many architectural marvels and houses embellished with sculptures and paintings.

### Mate choice in fruit flies is rational and adaptive [^3ac6ec35]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We have demonstrated that mate choice in fruit flies shows the major hallmark of rational decision-making, transitivity, and that this transitivity is repeatable across males from several unrelated populations. We used males as the choosers in our assays to demonstrate adaptive rational mate choice because, despite accumulating evidence for the presence of male mate choiceand its importance in evolution, the assumption that males act as eager but indiscriminate mating partners remains pervasive. When we carried out assays that removed female response behaviours from sexual interactions, we found agreement with male choice between two female lines whether females were responding (unmanipulated) or non-responding (decapitated) in most, but not all, instances. Therefore, although male behaviour appears to play an important role in the observed mate choices, female behaviour also appears to significantly affect mate choice. Although we found strong evidence that both male and female behaviour contribute to mate choice in our trials, the facts remain that female genotypes were sorted linearly with respect to likelihood of mating, and that this linear sorting benefited males. The transitivity and repeatability of mate choice across different male genetic backgrounds and availability of signals show that the behaviour of both males and females is integral to mate choice, and male choice needs to be incorporated further into theoretical and empirical studies of sexual selection.

### Forced to be right [^edb13550]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2014). Low credibility.

In "Forced to be Free", Neil Levy surveys the raft of documented decision-making biases that humans are heir to, and advances several bold proposals designed to enhance the patient's judgment. Gratefully, Levy is moved by the psychological research on judgment and decision-making that documents people's inaccuracy when identifying courses of action will best promote their subjective well-being. But Levy is quick to favour the patient's present preferences, to ensure they get "final say" about their treatment. I urge the opposite inclination, raising doubts about whether the patient's "present preferences" are the best expression of their "final say". When there is adequate evidence that people, by their own lights, overemphasize their present preferences about the future, we should carefully depreciate those preferences, in effect biasing them to make the right decision by their own lights.

These two authors have had stimulating and satisfying careers in IR, have achieved international recognition, received great support from male and female colleagues alike and have enjoyed successful family lives. We are not exceptional but dedicated to the specialty that we love and to the patients that we treat. And, we are not alone.

Many IR societies throughout the world are awakening to the threat that attracting insufficient numbers of women to IR poses and are encouraging women to get involved. We owe it to our patients that this specialty should continue to thrive and innovate. That can only be done by continuing to inspire and attract the brightest graduates who are increasingly women. The workforce needs to reflect the population, allowing patients' choice not only in how they are treated, but also by whom they are treated.

If we fail in this, IR will fail too. If we succeed, then we will have a well-balanced, intelligent and expanding workforce with a successful future.

### 10 issues for the clinician in tricuspid regurgitation evaluation and management: 2025 ACC expert consensus decision pathway: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^3faa8964]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) and tricuspid regurgitation (TR) — In patients with TR undergoing AF ablation, recurrence and rhythm outcomes vary, with a series of 294 patients showing that 12.9% had A-STR and 20% experienced recurrent AF at a mean follow-up of 13.4 months; recurrence was strongly associated with the presence of TR. In an observational series of tricuspid valve (TV) surgery, adding a concomitant maze procedure compared with TV surgery alone was associated with being in sinus rhythm at 9 years (56%) and with fewer major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events at 10 years. In a propensity-matched cohort of 406 patients undergoing mitral valve repair or replacement with or without a maze procedure for AF, the nonablated group had higher risks of developing moderate to severe TR, progressive TR, and death, and at 5 years AF recurrence was associated with progressive TR and deterioration in right-sided heart function. Across cohorts, leaflet tethering height ≥ 6 mm marked higher cumulative risks of stroke, recurrent AF, and TR in the catheter ablation group, whereas there were no differences in these risks between surgical and catheter ablation groups among patients with TV tethering height of < 6 mm. Observational evidence suggests that AF plays a key role in the development and progression of TR, restoration of sinus rhythm shows promise but rhythm control efficacy can be difficult to predict, and an individualized approach is necessary.

### Models of KPTN-related disorder implicate mTOR signalling in cognitive and overgrowth phenotypes [^13445759]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We have generated and characterized two informative models of KPTN -related disorder, a recent addition to the growing family of mTORopathies. Through behavioural, cognitive, morphological and molecular investigations we have demonstrated robust concordance between the Kptn −/− mouse and numerous aspects of human KRD. Our detailed characterization of the progressive nature of brain overgrowth in KRD provides critical insight into disease progression. Through animal and cellular modelling, we have strengthened the link between KPTN and mTOR signalling, and by inference, the role of aberrant mTOR signalling in KRD.

Our preclinical therapeutic investigation indicates that mTOR dysregulation in KRD is rapamycin-sensitive, providing a pathway to possible clinical intervention. The relationship between megalencephaly and cognitive dysfunction in KRD is unclear. The brain overgrowth phenotype could be the primary cause of the cognitive deficits observed in KRD. Alternatively, the neurological phenotypes could be caused by the persistent deregulation of mTOR signalling we observe in adult Kptn −/− mice, given the known role of mTOR in cognition and memory formation. If so, the morphological changes in KRD could simply reflect the effects of KPTN variants on brain growth via overactive mTOR signalling. Indeed, the neurological features of KRD are strikingly similar to Smith-Kingsmore syndrome caused by germline gain-of-function variants in MTOR. As mTOR inhibitors are generally well tolerated, the path to clinical intervention in KRD may be tantalizingly short, and follow-up experiments using our mouse and cellular models should provide critical information to shape clinical trials.

### Sex, relationships and' everyday psychology' on British magazine problem pages, C. 1960–1990 [^52bfe9ab]. Medical Humanities (2023). Medium credibility.

The stress and depression are entirely your choice. By going for an affair to remedy your marriage problem you've landed yourself in a no-through road where you and your lover are cheating on everybody, including each other. Where's the respect and friendship in that? Guide yourself back to your husband and explain what's gone wrong between you. I'm sure he'll show some feeling for you if you show some for him.

As this response shows, agony aunts often had little patience with letter-writers who claimed the inability to control their emotions. Mary Grant's impatience with one such supplicant was clear when she asked, 'How was it "inevitable" that he became your lover? What's so inevitable about hurling yourself out of a safe, loving, happy marriage into all this worry and misery?'.

Advice columnists applied the same rules of rationality and responsibility to many different kinds of problems over these decades.flatly told a separated woman pregnant by her estranged husband, 'You chose to marry — that carries continuing responsibilities. You chose to make love, and that has now brought about concern for another life'. She did not judge the sexual adventuring of the 27-year-old who had tried and enjoyed 'a lot of sex games' with her ex-boyfriend, but now worried about becoming promiscuous, simply stating that 'Different people mean different things by promiscuous, but plenty of people have short-term relationships on the way to a lasting one'. However, she quickened at the correspondent's unwillingness to admit her own agency: 'plenty of people have a strong, lively interest in sex But they don't all rush into compulsive copulation. They use restraint and responsibility in sex — and so can you the short answer is — if you don't want a promiscuous life, don't lead one'. Likewise, she acidly queried of the 17-year-old who wanted to know whether to start taking the pill 'in case I end up having sex without meaning to', 'wouldn't it be better to avoid any situations where you can't exercise your rational choice about having sex or not?'.

### The APA guidelines for psychological practice with sexual minority persons: an executive summary of the 2021 revision [^617e1ecc]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

APA Guidelines for Psychological Practice With Sexual Minority Persons — terminology definitions include: Mixed-orientation relationship refers to a relationship where partners in a romantic relationship identify with differing sexual orientations; Monosexism refers to the assumption that people are, or can be, only either heterosexual, lesbian, or gay, and attracted to only one sex/ gender, which minimizes bi+ sexualities and the idea that sexuality exists on a continuum; Pansexual refers to those whose sexual or romantic attraction is not defined by gender; and Plurisexual is a term used to refer to sexual minority orientations that are not explicitly based on attraction to one sex and leave open the potential for attraction to more than one sex/gender. Queer is a formerly pejorative term that has been reclaimed and operates as an umbrella term for any nonheterosexual identity, allowing more inclusivity, particularly for those whose sexuality is more fluid or shifts over time. Sex is typically assigned at birth (or before during ultrasound) based on the appearance of external genitalia; when the external genitalia are ambiguous other indicators (e.g., internal genitalia, chromosomal and hormonal sex) are considered to assign a sex with the aim of assigning a sex that is most likely to be congruent with the child's gender identity, and sex is typically categorized as male, female, or intersex (i.e., sexual anatomy that combines or is atypical of male and female characteristics). Sexuality refers to a broad dimension of human sexual behavior, including sexual values, needs, preferences, and preferred modes of sexual expression, intimacy, and affect. Sexual fluidity refers to changes in attraction, sexual identity, or orientation over time and is bi-directional, meaning a change toward or away from same-sex/gender attraction. Sexual identity refers to the action of claiming through recognition, acceptance, or self-labeling one's sexual orientation as it is relevant to the self. Sexual minority constitutes a group of individuals whose sexual and affectual orientation, romantic attraction, or sexual characteristics differ from that of heterosexuals, and sexual minority persons are inclusive of lesbian, gay, bi+, and asexual identified individuals. Transgender is an adjective that is an umbrella term used to describe the full range of people whose gender identity or gender role do not conform to what is typically associated with their sex assigned at birth, and although the term transgender is commonly accepted, not all transgender and gender nonconforming people self-identify as transgender.

He studied at the Chase Art School and then went on to the National Academy of Design and the Art Students League, where he worked under Thomas Fogarty, George Bridgman, and Frank Vincent Dumond. "In those days there wasn't the cleavage between fine arts and illustration that there is today," Rockwell wrote. "It was the end of what you might call the golden age of illustration." Frederick Remington had just died, and photographs were crowding the magazine and book publishing scene. Perhaps people had stopped demanding fine illustration, he thought; "You can't conduct a golden age with a heart of copper".

Rockwell was scorned for becoming an illustrator, even by his fellow students. "You know, if I worked as hard as you do, I could be as good as Velásquez," one of them would joke. "Why don't you?" Rockwell would respond and return to some vexing problem at hand, how to draw an eye for instance so it did not look "like a fried egg."

"I can't say who has influenced me really. Or at least I can't say how the artists I have admired have influenced me… Ever since I can remember, Rembrandt has been my favorite artist. Vermeer, Breughel, Velásquez, Canaletto; Dürer, Holbein, Ingres as draftsmen; Matisse, Klee―these are a few of the others I admire now. During my student days I studied closely the works of Edwin Austin Abbey, J.C. and Frank Leyendecker, Howard Pyle, Sargent, Whistler".

"I had a secret ambition: a cover on the Saturday Evening Post. In those days the cover of the Post was the greatest show window in America for an illustrator… 'Must be two million people look at that cover'. After the Post, offers came from other magazines: Life, Judge, The People's Popular Monthly. "One of the most difficult problems in painting magazine covers is thinking up ideas which a majority of the readers will understand… And it's darned hard to be universal, to find some situation which will strike the farmer, the housewife, the gossip…"

His seminal article was published in 1913. Dr Henry Lynch took Warthin's studies and began using more modern techniques to characterize this so-called "Family G", beginning in the 1960s. Somehow in this process, Warthin's observations became "Lynch syndrome". We need a better name for this condition, and propose "Warthin-Lynch syndrome" to also honor its primary discoverer.
