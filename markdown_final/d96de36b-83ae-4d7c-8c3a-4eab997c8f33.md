## Question

What medications are useful for sobriety from alcohol?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medications are useful for sobriety from alcohol, meaning what to use to maintain abstinence or meaningfully reduce heavy drinking risk after withdrawal is managed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the goal of "sobriety" (full abstinence versus reduction in heavy drinking) and separating withdrawal management from maintenance therapy. Then, I should verify first-line FDA‑approved options and their comparative efficacy. Next, I will examine second‑line and off‑label agents. After that, I need to check contraindications, special populations, and formulation choices. Finally, I should review real‑world effectiveness signals and integrate psychosocial treatment because medications work best in combination with behavioral care [^115Wev9o] [^114Sw4YZ].

> Let me first confirm the treatment targets because the word "sobriety" can mean different things to different patients. Clinically, we either target complete abstinence or a marked reduction in heavy drinking defined by FDA and WHO thresholds, both of which are accepted endpoints with functional benefits in trials and long‑term follow‑up studies, so I should not assume abstinence is the only meaningful success metric if the patient prefers reduction and safety improvement instead [^115Lu8XC] [^115vDFdC] [^11371CXP] [^115VWcqA].

> Hold on, I should verify the evidence‑based first‑line maintenance pharmacotherapies. The medications FDA‑approved in the US are naltrexone (oral daily or extended‑release monthly injection), acamprosate (TID, renally cleared), and disulfiram (daily aversive agent, best when supervised), with guidelines consistently recommending naltrexone and acamprosate first‑line, reserving disulfiram for selected patients who are highly motivated for abstinence and can be supervised [^114yDfTU] [^113nucNr] [^112Tx3mc] [^114qDANM].

> Next, I will examine comparative efficacy because choosing between naltrexone and acamprosate depends on the patient's goal. Let me think this through: meta‑analyses show acamprosate is a bit better for maintaining abstinence once detoxified, whereas naltrexone is more effective at reducing heavy drinking and craving; both have modest but clinically meaningful absolute benefits with NNTs roughly in the 11–20 range depending on outcome and synthesis, which helps set realistic expectations during shared decision‑making [^11371CXP] [^1111ptfT] [^115VWcqA].

> I need to check formulation choices for naltrexone because adherence can dictate success. Extended‑release injectable naltrexone avoids daily pill taking and is reasonable at care transitions, but wait, let me verify head‑to‑head data: a recent randomized trial in hospitalized patients found no statistically significant difference in heavy drinking outcomes at 3 months between oral and injectable formulations, suggesting choice should hinge on preference, access, and follow‑up logistics rather than presumed superiority of one formulation [^113gtSPU].

> Now, I will review disulfiram's role with caution. Supervised disulfiram can help a subset who choose an aversive approach and can ensure no alcohol exposure, but double‑blind trials have been mixed and safety requires careful selection and monitoring; most guidelines keep it second‑line despite ongoing debate advocating first‑line status when supervised, so I need to confirm the patient fit before recommending it [^114qDANM] [^112PE2MB] [^115Q6Zrt].

> Let me consider off‑label options for patients who cannot take or do not respond to first‑line agents. The APA suggests topiramate or gabapentin as alternatives in moderate‑to‑severe AUD; notably, a randomized trial of gabapentin in individuals with recent withdrawal symptoms improved no‑heavy‑drinking and total abstinence rates, indicating a niche where gabapentin may be especially helpful, although these remain off‑label in the US [^116CR4HQ] [^115GEvD5] [^115RT2i4].

> I should double‑check the separation between withdrawal management and maintenance therapy because conflating them leads to harm. Benzodiazepines are first‑line for acute alcohol withdrawal based on symptom severity scales and are tapered off over days; they are not maintenance medications for relapse prevention, and real‑world data show benzodiazepine exposure is associated with more AUD hospitalizations and higher mortality, reinforcing that their role ends after detoxification stabilizes the patient [^114E3L4E] [^113pRDwj] [^113V64BP] [^116k9ZDp] [^114h98K8].

> Next, I should review contraindications and special populations so I don't miss safety issues. I need to ensure no current or anticipated opioid use before starting naltrexone, given risk of precipitated withdrawal and blocked analgesia; I also need to monitor liver enzymes with naltrexone due to dose‑related hepatotoxicity risk, whereas acamprosate is renally cleared and contraindicated in severe renal impairment with dosing reductions in moderate renal disease; in pregnancy and breastfeeding, we avoid maintenance pharmacotherapy and treat only severe withdrawal under specialist guidance [^115LR54y] [^111cjJJU] [^1137Ja8g] [^114yDfTU].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said "prefer naltrexone in hepatic impairment because it has no hepatic metabolism", but that would be incorrect; let me correct that explicitly. In clinically significant liver disease, we generally favor acamprosate due to renal clearance and avoid or use great caution with naltrexone and disulfiram, with specialist input and careful LFT monitoring if any hepatically metabolized agent is considered; ASAM also advises using medications with less reliance on hepatic metabolism in hepatic impairment, which supports choosing acamprosate when feasible [^115Fj7cS] [^111cjJJU] [^114qDANM].

> I will now examine real‑world effectiveness signals to see how they align with trials. In a large Swedish within‑individual cohort, periods on naltrexone monotherapy, and combinations including naltrexone, correlated with fewer AUD and all‑cause hospitalizations, whereas benzodiazepines correlated with worse outcomes; intriguingly, acamprosate monotherapy showed a signal toward higher AUD hospitalization risk in that dataset, which conflicts with RCT evidence supporting acamprosate for abstinence, so I should interpret that observational signal cautiously given confounding and design limits acknowledged by the authors [^1173taag] [^111L27ez] [^115mBx7V] [^11371CXP].

> Next, I should review integration with psychosocial treatments because medications rarely operate in isolation. APA recommends a documented person‑centered plan linking pharmacotherapy with evidence‑based behavioral care, and emerging syntheses suggest that adding digital or remote supports to in‑person treatment can further reduce relapse risk; a Cochrane review underscores that combining pharmacological and psychosocial interventions can improve outcomes compared with either alone in many trials [^115Wev9o] [^115GXc5y] [^114Sw4YZ].

> Putting this together into a practical path, I need to ensure goal‑concordant choices. For abstinence goals after detoxification, acamprosate is a strong first‑line option and naltrexone is reasonable if abstinence is tenuous or reduction is acceptable; for heavy‑drinking reduction or if acamprosate is not suitable, naltrexone is first‑line, with topiramate or gabapentin as off‑label second‑line options if first‑line agents are contraindicated or ineffective; disulfiram fits motivated, supervised patients seeking abstinence, and benzodiazepines are limited to the acute withdrawal window with discontinuation thereafter [^113nucNr] [^114yDfTU] [^116CR4HQ] [^114qDANM] [^114E3L4E].

> Finally, I should confirm ongoing monitoring and follow‑up. I need to check for adverse effects, labs where indicated (LFTs for naltrexone, renal function for acamprosate), reassess goals and adherence, and adjust the plan by patient preference, response, and comorbidities; offering pharmacotherapy proactively and early, linked to psychosocial support, remains a key quality standard in primary care and specialty settings for alcohol use disorder [^111TAZeJ] [^114yDfTU] [^115Wev9o].

The most effective medications for maintaining sobriety are **naltrexone** [^114yDfTU] and **acamprosate** [^113nucNr], first-line therapies that reduce heavy drinking and support abstinence [^115VWcqA]. **Disulfiram** is a second-line option for highly motivated patients with supervision [^112PE2MB] [^114qDANM]. **Topiramate** and **gabapentin** are off-label alternatives for those who cannot use or do not respond to first-line agents [^116CR4HQ] [^114TwxyN]. **Benzodiazepines** are for short-term withdrawal only, not maintenance [^114E3L4E] [^114h98K8]. Medication choice should be **individualized**, based on patient goals, comorbidities, and preferences, and combined with psychosocial support for best outcomes [^115Wev9o] [^114Sw4YZ].

## First-line medications

### Naltrexone

- **Mechanism of action**: Opioid receptor antagonist that reduces alcohol's rewarding effects and craving [^114TwxyN].

- **Clinical evidence**: Strong evidence supports naltrexone for reducing heavy drinking [^114yDfTU] and improving abstinence [^11371CXP] [^115VWcqA].

- **Formulations**: Available as oral (daily) and extended-release injectable (monthly) [^113gtSPU] [^114LNhLw].

- **Clinical considerations**: Contraindicated in patients using opioids or with anticipated opioid needs [^115LR54y].

---

### Acamprosate

- **Mechanism of action**: Modulates glutamatergic neurotransmission to reduce craving and support abstinence [^114TwxyN].

- **Clinical evidence**: Recommended to prevent return-to-use [^116sZVny] in abstinent patients [^113nucNr] [^115VWcqA].

- **Clinical considerations**: Avoid in severe renal impairment; dose adjust in mild-to-moderate renal impairment [^111cjJJU].

---

## Second-line medication

### Disulfiram

- **Mechanism of action**: Inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase, causing aversive reactions if alcohol is consumed [^114TwxyN].

- **Clinical evidence**: Effective in highly motivated patients with supervision [^112PE2MB] [^114qDANM].

- **Clinical considerations**: Requires strict adherence and supervision; contraindicated in severe cardiovascular disease, psychosis, and pregnancy [^114TwxyN].

---

## Off-label medications

### Topiramate

Topiramate is an anticonvulsant that reduces craving and **heavy drinking**. Moderate evidence shows it reduces heavy drinking days [^116CR4HQ], though cognitive side effects may limit use [^114TwxyN].

---

### Gabapentin

Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant that reduces withdrawal symptoms and craving [^116CR4HQ]. It is **effective in patients experiencing withdrawal symptoms**; sedation and dizziness are common side effects.

---

## Medications for alcohol withdrawal management

**Benzodiazepines** are **first-line for acute withdrawal** [^114E3L4E] but are not recommended for long-term maintenance due to dependence risk [^114h98K8]. Carbamazepine and gabapentin are alternatives when benzodiazepines are contraindicated or used as adjuncts [^1113W8sF] [^113pRDwj].

---

## Combination therapy

Combining pharmacotherapy with psychosocial interventions **improves outcomes** versus either alone [^114Sw4YZ] [^1125E2aU]. **Naltrexone** combined with **acamprosate** or **disulfiram** reduces hospitalization risk and improves adherence.

---

## Patient-specific considerations

Medication selection and dosing should **account for hepatic or renal impairment** as well as psychiatric comorbidities [^111yR89h]. Choices should reflect patient goals, likelihood of adherence, and side-effect tolerance [^1139H8uB] [^116t6QHX]. During pregnancy, avoid pharmacotherapy unless treating acute withdrawal or co-occurring disorders [^1137Ja8g].

### Real-world effectiveness of pharmacological treatments of alcohol use disorders in a Swedish nation-wide cohort of 125 556 patients [^114h98K8]. Addiction (2021). Low credibility.

Benzodiazepines and related drugs were associated with a higher risk of mortality and hospitalization due to alcohol use disorder (AUD). Benzodiazepines are used to reduce alcohol withdrawal symptoms and decrease the risk of seizures, although they may also be used for the treatment of other comorbid problems such as anxiety disorders or insomnia, which may confound our results. Altogether, the evidence shows that AUD increases the risk of benzodiazepine misuse, and because of their addictive potential, risk of tolerance, and side effects, they are not safe to use when combined with alcohol. Thus, the use of benzodiazepines in treating AUD should be carefully considered and should not be used for the maintenance of alcohol abstinence.

None of the studied AUD medications — disulfiram, acamprosate, naltrexone, or nalmefene — were associated with a higher risk of mortality, which is a positive safety signal, as some of these medications have been associated with severe adverse effects. For example, disulfiram may cause hepatitis, neuropathy, optic neuritis, psychosis, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, respiratory depression, and, rarely, death. Usually, however, these medications are well tolerated and have only mild side effects. Because the mortality risk did not increase during drug use (even during combination use), our results suggest that the studied medications are safe to use and, concerning the efficacy on reducing hospitalizations, recommendable.

Regarding medical management for alcohol use disorder, specifically in relation to anticonvulsants, the APA 2018 guidelines recommend considering offering topiramate or gabapentin to patients with moderate-to-severe AUD. The goal is to reduce alcohol consumption or achieve abstinence. Topiramate or gabapentin is preferred for patients who are intolerant to or not responding to naltrexone and acamprosate and do not have contraindications to these medications.

### Disulfiram should remain second-line treatment for most patients with alcohol use disorder [^112PE2MB]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is responsible for a significant burden of medical, economic, and social harm globally and across the United States. Currently, only three FDA-approved medications for AUD are available, and most patients with AUD never receive pharmacotherapy. Disulfiram, the first medication that the FDA approved for the treatment of AUD, is recommended as a second-line treatment option by several national treatment guidelines citing safety concerns and lack of high-quality comparative studies. In this issue, Holt argues that disulfiram should be reclassified as a first-line treatment for AUD based on promising open-label randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for disulfiram as a behavioral intervention.

Review of the literature suggests that disulfiram can be a useful treatment for a highly selected group of patients with no medical or psychiatric contraindications, high motivation for abstinence, and adequate family support. Unfortunately, many patients with AUD — a disorder characterized by high rates of medical and psychiatric multimorbidity and social vulnerability — fall outside of this narrow selection criteria. Prescribers should consider other FDA-approved medications as first-line treatment options for most patients with AUD, reserving disulfiram for the rare patients in whom the potential for benefit clearly outweighs the risk of harm.

### Overview of alcohol use disorder [^115RT2i4]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Alcohol is regularly consumed throughout most of the world, including by nearly half the U.S. population aged 12 or older. Heavy drinking, which is also common, contributes to multiple adverse medical, psychiatric, and social outcomes and more than 140,000 deaths annually in the United States. It is the major risk factor for alcohol use disorder (AUD), whose U.S. prevalence is 11%. However, AUD is undertreated, with less than 15% of individuals with a lifetime diagnosis receiving any treatment. The risk of AUD is nearly equally genetic and environmental. AUD is responsive to psychosocial treatments, including cognitive-behavioral therapy and motivational enhancement therapy. Alcohol affects multiple neurotransmitter systems, and thus pharmacotherapy for AUD is also effective.

- **Medications**: The three medications approved in the United States to treat AUD — disulfiram, naltrexone (oral and long-acting injectable formulations), and acamprosate — are underprescribed, despite being considered first-line treatments in clinical practice guidelines. Two medications not approved for treating AUD, topiramate and gabapentin, have shown efficacy in treating the disorder and are used off-label.

- **Novel treatments**: Recent studies of novel drug candidates, including psychedelics and phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors, are promising additions for the treatment of AUD, although they require further evaluation before being used clinically. Despite the growing availability of efficacious psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for AUD, it remains a highly stigmatized condition.

### Real-world effectiveness of pharmacological treatments of alcohol use disorders in a Swedish nation-wide cohort of 125 556 patients [^116JaguB]. Addiction (2021). Low credibility.

To the best of our knowledge, no other prospective cohort study has studied the real-world effectiveness of pharmacotherapy in alcohol use disorder (AUD) during a long-term follow-up period. We found that in comparison to personal no-use periods of any AUD medication, naltrexone as a monotherapy and combined with acamprosate and disulfiram was associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization due to AUD and any causes. Polytherapy of the studied medications and disulfiram monotherapy were associated with a lower risk of hospitalization due to alcohol-related somatic causes. Benzodiazepines and acamprosate as a monotherapy were associated with an increased risk of hospitalization due to AUD, and the use of benzodiazepines was associated with a higher mortality rate.

In this study, based on a cohort of more than 125,000 patients diagnosed with AUD, 25.6% of the individuals used some of the studied AUD drugs during the follow-up. Previous studies have shown that medications for treating AUD are under-prescribed and under-utilized, and depending on the study, only approximately 10–20% of patients with AUD receive prescribed medication for their AUD. Even though the proportion of AUD medication users was low, 34% of the cohort had used benzodiazepines. Increased use of benzodiazepines has been linked to the onset of AUD in a naturalistic 12-year follow-up study in the United States, and use of benzodiazepines was associated with an increased risk of mortality in our study. The problem is thus not only under-prescription of medications but also prescribing the wrong medications. Naltrexone as monoth…

### Alcohol use disorders [^116rFP64]. Lancet (2016). Low credibility.

Alcohol use disorders are common in developed countries, where alcohol is cheap, readily available, and heavily promoted. Common mild disorders often remit in young adulthood, but more severe disorders can become chronic and require long-term medical and psychological management. Doctors are uniquely positioned to opportunistically assess and manage alcohol use disorders. However, in practice, diagnosis and treatment are often delayed. Brief behavioral intervention is effective in primary care for hazardous drinkers and individuals with mild disorders. These interventions could also encourage early entry to treatment for people with more severe illness who are underdiagnosed and undertreated.

Sustained abstinence is the optimum outcome for severe disorders. The stigma that discourages treatment-seeking needs to be reduced, and pragmatic approaches should be adopted for patients who initially reject abstinence as a goal. It is more important to engage people in one or more psychological and pharmacological treatments of equivalent effectiveness than to advocate a specific treatment. A key research priority is to improve the diagnosis and treatment of the most affected people who have comorbid mental and other drug use disorders.

### Sodium oxybate for the maintenance of abstinence in alcohol-dependent patients: An international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114VP2MV]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Low credibility.

Heterogeneity of the sodium oxybate (SMO) effect in the maintenance of abstinence (MoA) has also been observed in previous SMO randomized controlled trials (RCTs), with a larger effect size in patient populations with a lower placebo response rate. This heterogeneity in efficacy is not specific to the treatment of alcohol dependence (AD) with SMO. In a meta-analysis of 51 RCTs for AD, the variability of the effect sizes of acamprosate and naltrexone across trials was substantial, and the treatment effect estimates were significantly negatively correlated with the placebo response in the study population.

In the trial, the placebo response in terms of cumulative abstinence duration (CAD) (mean 73 days at study level) was higher than expected (40–50 days), and the treatment effect was negatively correlated with the placebo response at site level: the lower the placebo response, the higher the treatment effect in the site. Although this post-hoc finding should be interpreted with caution, it is important to further study moderators of SMO treatment effect and the predictors of the placebo response. Recent subgroup analyses of RCTs and a meta-regression of 19 RCTs found higher placebo responses in AD patients with more than 14 consecutive days of abstinence prior to randomization. In the GATE 2 study, only patients with a detoxification period of at least 20 days were included, and this may explain the relatively high placebo response at the study level.

There is a convergence of evidence that the duration of abstinence before treatment initiation and/or the baseline alcohol consumption could be moderators of the effect of SMO in AD. Unfortunately, these baseline data were not available.

### Efficacy of gabapentin for the treatment of alcohol use disorder in patients with alcohol withdrawal symptoms: A randomized clinical trial [^115GEvD5]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Although an estimated 30 million people meet the criteria for alcohol use disorder (AUD), few receive appropriate pharmacotherapy. A more personalized, symptom-specific approach might improve efficacy and acceptance. This study examines whether gabapentin is useful in the treatment of AUD, especially in those with the most alcohol withdrawal symptoms.

This double-blind randomized clinical trial, conducted between November 2014 and June 2018, evaluated gabapentin versus placebo in community-recruited participants. These participants were screened and treated in an academic outpatient setting over a 16-week treatment period. A total of 145 treatment-seeking individuals, who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) criteria for AUD and were not receiving other AUD interventions, were screened. Ninety-six participants, who also met recent alcohol withdrawal criteria, were randomized to treatment after three abstinent days. Daily drinking was recorded, and the percentage of disialo carbohydrate-deficient transferrin in the blood, a heavy drinking marker, was collected at baseline and monthly during treatment.

Interventions involved gabapentin up to 1200 mg/day, orally, versus placebo, along with nine medical management visits (20 minutes each).

Main outcomes and measures included the percentage of individuals with no heavy drinking days and those with total abstinence, which were compared between treatment groups and further evaluated based on prestudy alcohol withdrawal symptoms.

Of the 96 randomized individuals, 90 were evaluable (44 in the gabapentin arm and 46 in the placebo arm).

### Real-world effectiveness of pharmacological treatments of alcohol use disorders in a Swedish nation-wide cohort of 125 556 patients [^111L27ez]. Addiction (2021). Low credibility.

Pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorder (AUD) is recommendable but under-used, possibly due to deficient knowledge of medications. This study aimed to investigate the real-world effectiveness of approved pharmacological treatments (disulfiram, acamprosate, naltrexone, and nalmefene) for AUD.

- **Design**: A nation-wide, register-based cohort study.
- **Setting**: Sweden.
- **Participants**: All residents aged 16–64 years living in Sweden, with registered first-time treatment contact due to AUD from July 2006 to December 2016 (n = 125,556, 62.5% men), were identified from nation-wide registers.
- **Measurements**: The main outcome was hospitalization due to AUD. The secondary outcomes included hospitalization due to any cause, alcohol-related somatic causes, work disability (sickness absence or disability pension), and death. Mortality was analyzed with between-individual analysis using a traditional multivariate-adjusted Cox hazards regression model. Outcomes such as hospitalization-based events and work disability were analyzed and within-individual analyses were conducted to eliminate selection bias.

Findings revealed that naltrexone combined with acamprosate [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.61–0.89], combined with disulfiram (HR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.60–0.96), and as monotherapy (HR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.81–0.97) was associated with a significantly lower risk of AUD-hospitalization compared with no use of AUD medication. Similar results were found for the risk of hospitalization due to any cause. Benzodiazepine use and acamprosate monotherapy were associated with an incomplete sentence…

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^114E3L4E]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically in relation to indications for pharmacotherapy in an outpatient setting, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend initiating pharmacotherapy for patients at risk of developing new or worsening signs or symptoms of withdrawal. This is particularly pertinent for patients with a history of withdrawal episodes of at least moderate severity and those within the window for the development of symptoms in the time course of withdrawal.

- **Medications for monotherapy**: Administer benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, or gabapentin.

- **Treatment strategy**: Administer at least a single dose of benzodiazepine, followed by ongoing treatment according to symptom severity as another strategy.

- **Patient reassessment**: Frequently reassess patients over the next 24 hours to monitor their need for withdrawal medication if the risk of developing worse withdrawal is unknown.

### Stability of drinking reductions and long-term functioning among patients with alcohol use disorder [^114sjs6e]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization (WHO) categorizes alcohol consumption according to grams consumed into low-, medium-, high-, and very-high-risk drinking levels (RDLs). Although abstinence has been considered the ideal outcome of alcohol treatment, reductions in WHO RDLs have been proposed as primary outcomes for alcohol use disorder (AUD) trials.

- **Objective**: The study examines the stability of WHO RDL reductions and the association between RDL reductions and long-term functioning for up to 3 years following treatment.

- **Design and participants**: This was a secondary data analysis of patients with AUD enrolled in the COMBINE Study and Project MATCH, two multi-site, randomized AUD clinical trials, who were followed for up to 3 years post-treatment (COMBINE: n = 694; MATCH: n = 806).

- **Measures**: Alcohol use was measured via calendar-based methods. We estimated all models in the total sample and among participants who did not achieve abstinence during treatment.

- **Key results**: One-level RDL reductions were achieved by 84% of patients at the end of treatment, with 84.9% of those individuals maintaining that reduction at a 3-year follow-up. Two-level RDL reductions were achieved by 68% of patients at the end of treatment, with 77.7% of those individuals maintaining that reduction at a 3-year follow-up. One- and two-level RDL reductions at the end of treatment were associated with significantly better mental health, quality of life (including physical quality of life), and fewer drinking consequences 3 years after treatment (p < 0.05) compared to no change or increased drinking.

### Real-world effectiveness of pharmacological treatments of alcohol use disorders in a Swedish nation-wide cohort of 125 556 patients [^116k9ZDp]. Addiction (2021). Low credibility.

Altogether, 13,031 (10.4%) of patients with a diagnosis of AUD were also diagnosed with some other substance use disorder (ICD‐10: F11–F16, F18–F19) during the follow-up. Two or more of the studied medications used concomitantly (polytherapy) was associated with a non-significant (when FDR-corrected) trend towards a lower risk of hospitalization due to AUD in patients diagnosed with AUD only (HR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.71–0.91). As a sensitivity analysis for the risk of AUD hospitalization, we performed a subgroup analysis including only individuals diagnosed with acute alcohol intoxication (F10.0) more than once or having other alcohol-related diagnoses (F10.1–F10.9) before the start of follow-up, indicating a more serious alcohol problem. In this analysis as well, naltrexone combined with acamprosate and as monotherapy was associated with a lower risk of hospitalization due to AUD (HR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.58–0.87; HR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.81–0.98, respectively).

During the follow-up, 42,678 (34.0%) of patients used benzodiazepines and related drugs. The use was associated with a significantly increased risk of hospitalization due to AUD (HR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.14–1.22, P < 0.0001) compared with no use. No significant increase in the risk of hospitalization due to alcohol-related somatic causes was detected (HR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.88–1.12, P = 0.9036).

Overall, 7,832 (6.2%) of the patients died during the follow-up time. The adjusted risk of all-cause mortality was not significantly lower with any of the studied medications.

### Real-world effectiveness of pharmacological treatments of alcohol use disorders in a Swedish nation-wide cohort of 125 556 patients [^115mBx7V]. Addiction (2021). High credibility.

The main strengths of this study are the nationwide coverage of all AUD patients and the significant follow-up time of up to 7 years. For these reasons, the results are generalizable to real-world patients with AUD in countries with state-funded healthcare systems providing care and medications with no or very small co-payments. In addition, we used data on actually purchased medications instead of data on prescriptions given to the patients. We analyzed the risk of hospitalization-based outcomes and sickness absence by using a within-individual design, where each individual acts as his or her own control, which reduces selection bias. Drug use was modeled with the PRE2DUP method, which describes actual drug use well when compared with interview-reported use.

The limitations of this study include the lack of information on possibly reduced days and levels of alcohol consumption, so the effectiveness of studied medications was evaluated with secondary measures, such as risk of hospitalization due to alcohol-related causes, mortality, and work disability. However, these outcomes represent severe and significant disadvantages for both the individual and society. Another limitation is that we did not know the severity of AUD or the use of psychosocial treatments combined with pharmacotherapy. However, because the effectiveness of the studied drugs varied, the existence of possible psychosocial treatment combined with pharmacotherapy seems not pivotal.

### Treatment interventions to maintain abstinence from alcohol in primary care: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1125E2aU]. BMJ (2020). Low credibility.

- **Strengths and limitations of this review**: Our research question and study eligibility criteria were designed to align with practice to bridge the evidence gap in the care pathway of recently detoxified, alcohol-dependent patients in a primary care setting. A main strength of our study is the sensitive search strategies and snowballing technique used to retrieve potentially eligible studies. These were required because the titles, abstracts, and indexes of many studies do not contain keywords or are poorly indexed. We also included all available interventions suitable for primary care to provide an extensive list as a reference for clinical practice.

Our review also has limitations. Firstly, we focused on the maintenance of abstinence. While this is of direct relevance to clinical practice and service planning, it means we excluded studies that investigated the effect of interventions in reducing alcohol consumption in alcohol-dependent people who are still drinking (e.g. nalmefene and topiramate) rather than maintaining abstinence. Previous reviews of interventions in abstinent alcohol dependence (i.e. post-detoxification) have reported evidence of naltrexone in preventing relapse from a lapse, and for acamprosate or disulfiram in maintaining abstinence in patients with alcohol dependence. These three drugs are recommended by NICE for clinical effectiveness, and choice is tailored depending on the drinking behavior and clinical situation of a patient. It remains unclear which method of achieving abstinence is more effective for patients with severe alcohol dependency.

### Reductions in World Health Organization risk drinking level are associated with reductions in alcohol use disorder diagnosis and criteria: Evidence from an alcohol pharmacotherapy trial [^115yunbq]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

This study aimed to evaluate the validity of World Health Organization (WHO) risk drinking level reductions as meaningful endpoints for clinical practice and research. It examined whether such reductions were associated with a lower likelihood of an alcohol use disorder (AUD) diagnosis and fewer AUD criteria.

- **Methods**: We conducted a secondary data analysis using data from a multisite randomized controlled trial of gabapentin enacarbil extended release in treating moderate to severe AUD among adults (N = 346). Participants received gabapentin enacarbil extended release or a placebo for six months. The timeline follow-back method was used to assess WHO risk drinking level reductions, and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview was used to assess Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) AUD diagnosis and criteria at baseline (past year) and end of treatment (past month).

- **Results**: Most participants (80.1%) achieved at least a one-level reduction in WHO risk drinking levels from baseline to end of treatment, and nearly half of participants (49.8%) achieved at least a two-level reduction. At least a one-level or two-level reduction in WHO risk drinking level predicted lower odds of an active AUD diagnosis (one-level: odds ratio, 0.74 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.66–0.84]; two-level: odds ratio, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.64–0.79]) and fewer AUD criteria (one-level: B, -1.66 [95% CI, -2.35 to -0.98]; two-level: B, -1.76 [95% CI, -2.31 to -1.21]) at end of treatment.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^115P5zLM]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly concerning the management of alcohol use disorder, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend initiating treatment for alcohol use disorder concurrently with alcohol withdrawal management when feasible and as cognitive status permits. It is advised to offer the initiation of pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorder if appropriate. Explain the range of evidence-based treatment services available in the community and engage patients with these options. Consider providing information about local recovery support groups, including 12-step groups.

### In recently detoxified alcohol-dependent adults, acamprosate increases abstinence maintenance and reduces dropout [^1129mZtq]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Acamprosate has been shown to be effective in increasing abstinence maintenance and reducing dropout rates in alcohol-dependent adults who have recently detoxified. This conclusion is supported by a systematic review and network meta-analysis of treatment interventions intended to maintain abstinence from alcohol in primary care.

### Real-world effectiveness of pharmacological treatments of alcohol use disorders in a Swedish nation-wide cohort of 125 556 patients [^1173taag]. Addiction (2021). Low credibility.

During the follow-up (median = 4.6, IQR = 2.1–7.2 years), 30,044 (23.9%) patients experienced a main outcome event: AUD hospitalization. Naltrexone, when combined with acamprosate (HR = 0.74; 95% CI = 0.61–0.89), combined with disulfiram (HR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.60–0.96), and as monotherapy (HR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.81–0.97), was associated with a significantly lower risk of AUD hospitalization compared to periods when the same individuals did not use any AUD medication. The use of acamprosate was associated with a significantly increased risk of hospitalization due to AUD (see Fig. 1). The results were similar in the between-individual model (Supporting information, Fig. S1), and longer duration of naltrexone use was associated with a lower risk of AUD hospitalization (Supporting information, Table S4). Similar results were found when the outcome was hospitalization due to any cause. Naltrexone, whether combined with either disulfiram or acamprosate and as monotherapy, was associated with decreased risk of any hospitalization (HR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.64–0.94; HR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.69–0.94; HR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.83–0.96, respectively) (see Fig. 2). Acamprosate monotherapy was not associated with a higher risk of hospitalization due to any cause.

### Oral vs extended-release injectable naltrexone for hospitalized patients with alcohol use disorder: A randomized clinical trial [^114LNhLw]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Nearly 8% of people 12 years or older in the US have alcohol use disorder (AUD). Unfortunately, 94% of those with AUD do not receive medication or counseling. A setting in which to expand AUD treatment is the hospital, where one survey found 19% of inpatients have AUD. Few are discharged with medication or referrals to treatment, increasing acute care readmission.

Pharmacotherapies and manualized psychotherapies are the main AUD treatments. Given the moderate benefit for AUD medication, optimizing its delivery could improve outcomes. Naltrexone, the most commonly used AUD medication, is available as an oral daily tablet or monthly injection. Both formulations should be administered with medical management, including review of alcohol consumption, counseling, assessment of liver enzymes, and monitoring of medication adverse effects (AEs).

Extended-release injectable naltrexone removes the need for daily pill taking, potentially offering an advantage over oral naltrexone. However, patients may prefer daily pill taking to monthly injections due to the time and effort required for injection visits, negative attitudes toward injections, and greater control over the use of naltrexone. Extended-release injectable naltrexone is more costly ($1064.00 for one injection versus $38.10 for 30 days of oral naltrexone). Yet, cost-effectiveness could be similar if extended-release injectable naltrexone proves more effective with less health care utilization.

Initiating naltrexone at hospital discharge is feasible. However, to our knowledge, no published randomized clinical trial has yet compared oral naltrexone and extended-release injectable naltrexone.

### Stability of drinking reductions and long-term functioning among patients with alcohol use disorder [^115Lu8XC]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The Food and Drug Administration recommends sustained abstinence or no heavy drinking days as indicators of success for AUD treatment. Heavy drinking days are defined as more than three drinks in a day for women and four for men. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommends abstinence but also considers reduced drinking as a successful intermediate outcome. The EMA outcome includes reductions in total alcohol consumption, heavy drinking days, or World Health Organization (WHO) risk drinking levels (RDLs). These levels are defined by the number of grams (g) of alcohol consumed per day, including abstinent (0 g males/females), low risk (1 to 40 g males/1 to 20 g females), medium risk (41 to 60 g males/21 to 40 g females), high risk (61 to 100 g males/41 to 60 g females), or very high risk (101+ g males/61+ g females).

The WHO RDLs provide concrete guidance for defining levels of drinking associated with specific risk levels and offer targets for reducing drinking, such as a two-level reduction from very high risk to medium risk. Recent studies have shown that reductions in WHO RDLs are associated with improvements in health and functioning among both population samples and individuals in AUD treatment.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^113V64BP]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly in relation to inpatient pharmacotherapy indications, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend initiating pharmacotherapy with benzodiazepines as first-line therapy for patients experiencing severe alcohol withdrawal (CIWA-Ar score ≥ 19). Administer phenobarbital for providers experienced with its use if benzodiazepines are contraindicated. Consider using phenobarbital as an adjunct to benzodiazepines in settings with close monitoring. Additional adjunct medications may be considered after ensuring the administration of an adequate dose of benzodiazepines.

### What defines a clinically meaningful outcome in the treatment of substance use disorders: Reductions in direct consequences of drug use or improvement in overall functioning [^111Dvu2y]. Addiction (2019). Low credibility.

Sustained abstinence is currently the only accepted end-point for pharmacotherapy trials for most substance use disorders (SUD), with the exception of alcohol. Despite recent efforts, the identification of a non-abstinence alternative as a clinically meaningful end-point for drug use trials has been elusive.

- **Argument and analysis**: The standard for establishing a clinically meaningful outcome in SUD trials is to demonstrate that a reduction in drug use is associated with improvement in long-term functioning. However, data indicate relatively weak associations between drug use and various psychosocial problem domains. This may be because assessments used most commonly to measure an individual's functioning do not specify whether aspects of functioning are a direct consequence of drug use. The acceptance of a non-abstinence-based end-point for alcohol use disorder trials was supported in part through associations with reductions in alcohol-related consequences, although measures designed to assess the direct consequences of drug use are rarely included in drug treatment efficacy trials.

- **Conclusions**: The field of substance use disorders should include measures of negative psychosocial and health consequences of drug use, as opposed to overall functioning, in the effort to establish meaningful non-abstinence-based end-points.

### How effective are remote and/or digital interventions as part of alcohol and drug treatment and recovery support? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115GXc5y]. Addiction (2025). High credibility.

We meta‐analysed 42 interventions from 34 RCTs. Pooled effect estimates showed a 39% lower odds of relapse (95% CI = 0.46, 0.81) and a reduction in the mean days of alcohol/drug use (SMD = −0.18; 95% CI = −0.28 to −0.08) at the end of intervention for people receiving a remote intervention plus in‐person treatment, when compared to those who received in‐person treatment alone. This finding suggests that supplementing in‐person treatment with a remote intervention could be an effective approach for achieving positive treatment outcomes.

The pooled effect estimates for replacing or partially replacing in‐person treatment with remote intervention(s) were less conclusive. Analyses showed that the odds of relapse among the intervention group were approximately half that of the control group (OR = 0.51), but only a very small and uncertain reduction in days of use (SMD = −0.08; 95% CI = −0.24 to 0.07; P = 0.301). The conclusiveness of these latter findings is undermined by the smaller pool of evidence and the uncertainty of the days of use finding.

Furthermore, although heterogeneity (I²) was moderate across the four main meta‐analyses and did not rise above 50% (our pre‐specified threshold for substantial heterogeneity), the finding for replacement or partial replacement interventions on days of use was close to that threshold (I² = 48.4%). Additionally, because the assumption was that the replacement and partial replacement interventions should not result in worse outcomes than in‐person treatment, the large effect on relapse was unexpected.

### Does acamprosate improve reduction of drinking as well as aiding abstinence [^115P2oGz]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2003). Low credibility.

The study aimed to discover whether acamprosate reduces the severity of relapse for patients undergoing abstinence-oriented treatment who are unable to abstain completely. Data on patients' alcohol consumption from 15 placebo-controlled treatment studies (n = 3309) were examined to test whether, at a given time point, patients who have taken one or more drinks since the last assessment ('relapsers', n = 1010) consume alcohol on fewer days, report a lower average number of drinks per day, and consume less alcohol in total with acamprosate compared to placebo. These studies had varying durations (90 days, 180 days, and 360 days), with four common assessment dates (days 30, 90, 180, and 360).

Among relapsers, acamprosate was significantly associated with a reduced quantity and frequency of drinking compared to placebo in each of the four follow-up periods (p < 0.001). The differences were most marked for the product of quantity and frequency (overall weekly consumption). For each period, there were fewer individuals drinking an average of five or more drinks per day in the acamprosate group compared to the placebo group. Thus, acamprosate helps reduce the severity of relapse in patients undergoing abstinence-oriented treatment.

### Treatment interventions to maintain abstinence from alcohol in primary care: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116sZVny]. BMJ (2020). Low credibility.

To determine the most effective interventions in recently detoxified, alcohol-dependent patients for implementation in primary care, this systematic review and network meta-analysis was conducted.

Data were sourced from Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Randomised controlled trials were selected, comparing two or more interventions that could be implemented in primary care. The population consisted of patients with alcohol dependency diagnosed by standardized clinical tools and who became detoxified within four weeks.

The outcomes of interest were continuous abstinence from alcohol (effectiveness) and all-cause dropouts (as a proxy for acceptability) at least 12 weeks after the start of the intervention.

The analysis included 64 trials evaluating 43 interventions. The median probability of abstinence across placebo arms was found to be 25%. Compared with placebo, acamprosate was the only intervention associated with an increased probability of abstinence, with moderate certainty evidence (odds ratio 1.86, 95% confidence interval 1.49 to 2.33, corresponding to an absolute probability of 38%). Of the 62 included trials that reported all-cause dropouts, the interventions associated with a reduced number of dropouts compared with placebo (probability of 50%) and moderate certainty of evidence were acamprosate (0.73, 0.62 to 0.86; 42%), naltrexone (0.70, 0.50 to 0.98; 41%), and acamprosate-naltrexone (0.30, 0.13 to 0.67; 17%). Acamprosate was the only intervention associated with moderate confidence in the evidence.

### Pharmacologic approaches to the management of alcoholism [^113Vx1iw]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Our understanding of alcohol craving, both as a cause for chronic abuse and relapse and as a target for intervention, has been refined significantly in recent years. For example, craving experienced during alcohol withdrawal may be mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate receptor mechanisms, whereas the memory of the rewarding aspects of alcohol may be mediated by dopamine, opiate, and glutamate systems. Therefore, pharmacologic treatments for alcohol dependence may be targeted to numerous pathways. This article will discuss animal and clinical studies of the opioid antagonists (primarily naltrexone), acamprosate, and disulfiram. The side effects and treatment recommendations for each drug will also be reviewed.

### Real-world effectiveness of pharmacological treatments of alcohol use disorders in a Swedish nation-wide cohort of 125,556 patients [^113WexeY]. Addiction (2021). Low credibility.

In a Swedish nation-wide cohort of 125,556 patients diagnosed with alcohol use disorders (AUD), 78,434 individuals (62.5%) were men, with a mean age of 38.1 years (standard deviation [SD] = 15.9 years). The median follow-up time was 4.6 years, with an interquartile range (IQR) of 2.1 to 7.2 years. During the follow-up period, 32,129 (25.6%) of the patients used at least one of the following drugs: 19,274 (15.4%) patients used disulfiram; 11,432 (9.1%) used acamprosate; 10,872 (8.7%) used naltrexone; 693 (0.6%) used nalmefene; and 6,398 (5.1%) used two or more of the aforementioned medications concurrently. The clinical and socio-demographic characteristics of the cohort, as well as the numbers of events for each exposure and outcome analyzed, are detailed in the supporting information.

### Sodium oxybate for the maintenance of abstinence in alcohol-dependent patients: An international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111wX4od]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). High credibility.

Alcohol dependence (AD) occurs in 2.6% of people aged 15+ years worldwide and can result in a reduction of life expectancy by up to 35 years compared with the general population. One of the treatment goals for AD is abstinence. Currently, disulfiram, acamprosate, and naltrexone are registered for the maintenance of abstinence (MoA) in AD patients. Although effective on the group level, effect sizes are limited, and many AD patients fail to respond to these medications. Therefore, additional pharmacological treatments are needed.

Sodium oxybate (SMO), as an oral solution, has been approved in Italy and Austria for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome and the MoA since 1991 and 1999, respectively. SMO is the sodium salt of γ-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), a short-chain fatty acid that is naturally synthesized in the mammalian brain. GHB is a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonist, which binds with low affinity to GABA subtype B receptors (and indirectly with the GABA subtype A receptors) and with high affinity to GHB-specific receptors. Given that the pharmacological profile of GHB has some similarities to that of alcohol, one proposed mechanism of SMO in the treatment of AD is its ability to mimic some effects of alcohol in the brain, particularly to reduce craving while abstinent. SMO 50 mg/kg/day showed evidence of efficacy compared with placebo or naltrexone in the MoA in AD patients in a series of open-label and blinded randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and was positively evaluated for this indication in a Cochrane review.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^1134qwxL]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically in relation to indications for pharmacotherapy and outpatient care, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of pharmacotherapy in an outpatient setting. This is at the discretion of providers with extensive experience in managing alcohol withdrawal for patients experiencing severe but uncomplicated alcohol withdrawal (CIWA-Ar ≥ 19).

- **Pharmacotherapy recommendations**: Administer benzodiazepines as the first-line therapy. Phenobarbital can be administered as an alternative option for providers who are experienced with its use. Consider administering phenobarbital, carbamazepine, or gabapentin in cases where benzodiazepines are contraindicated.

### Combined pharmacological and psychosocial interventions for alcohol use disorder [^114Sw4YZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a mental disorder characterized by a strong desire to consume alcohol and impaired control of alcohol use, with devastating consequences. Many people with AUD do not respond to psychosocial or pharmacological interventions when these are provided alone. Combining these interventions may improve the response to treatment, though evidence remains limited.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of combined pharmacological and psychosocial interventions for the treatment of AUD in adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and two trials registers in November 2023, without language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing combined pharmacological and psychosocial interventions versus pharmacological or psychosocial interventions alone, or no intervention/treatment as usual (TAU), in adults with AUD. Our primary outcomes were continuous abstinent participants; frequency of use (measured as heavy drinkers, percentages of abstinent days, heavy-drinking days); amount of use (number of drinks per drinking day); adverse events; serious adverse events; dropouts from treatment; and dropouts due to adverse events.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We assessed risk of bias using Cochrane's RoB 1 tool, performed random-effects meta-analyses, and evaluated the certainty of evidence according to the GRADE approach.

- **Main results**: We included 21 RCTs (4746 participants). The most studied pharmacological and psychosocial interventions were naltrexone (81.0%) and co.

### Medications for treating alcohol dependence [^114PDXLA]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Medications for treating alcohol dependence primarily serve as adjunctive interventions, with only three medications — disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate — approved for this indication by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Disulfiram, an aversive agent used for more than 40 years, has significant adverse effects and compliance difficulties, with no clear evidence of increasing abstinence rates, decreasing relapse rates, or reducing cravings. In contrast, naltrexone, an anticraving agent, reduces relapse rates and cravings while increasing abstinence rates. Similarly, acamprosate reduces relapse rates and enhances abstinence rates.

- **Emerging agents**: Serotonergic and anticonvulsant agents show promise in the treatment of alcohol dependence. Although not FDA-approved for this indication, the anticonvulsant topiramate and several serotonergic agents (e.g. fluoxetine, ondansetron) have been shown in recent studies to increase abstinence rates and decrease drinking.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^116Y7qnv]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically in terms of indications for pharmacotherapy in an outpatient setting, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of pharmacotherapy or supportive care alone in patients with mild alcohol withdrawal (CIWA-Ar score < 10) who are at minimal risk of severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal or complications from alcohol withdrawal. Pharmacotherapy options include administering carbamazepine or gabapentin. For patients at risk of developing new or worsening withdrawal symptoms while away from the treatment setting, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, or gabapentin should be administered.

### Real-world effectiveness of pharmacological treatments of alcohol use disorders in a Swedish nation-wide cohort of 125 556 patients [^114XZJ3M]. Addiction (2021). Low credibility.

The risk of alcohol-related hospitalizations is lower when patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) are treated with naltrexone or combinations including naltrexone, disulfiram, or acamprosate. Polytherapy with the studied medications was also associated with a lower risk of hospitalization due to any cause. Acamprosate monotherapy was not associated with beneficial effects, defined in the study as a decreased risk for hospitalization due to AUD, alcohol-related somatic causes, work disability, or death.

Benzodiazepines were associated with a higher risk of hospitalization due to AUD and should not be administered other than in alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Pharmacotherapies for AUD are under-utilized, whereas benzodiazepine use was strikingly common among people with AUD. According to the data presented here, naltrexone and drug combinations, in particular, seem to be effective in the treatment of AUD and are recommended to be used as part of the treatment protocol; the use of benzodiazepines should be avoided.

### Stability of drinking reductions and long-term functioning among patients with alcohol use disorder [^111YUXz4]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is highly prevalent and has significant social and economic costs, yet most individuals with AUD never seek treatment. A primary reason reported by individuals with AUD for not seeking treatment is that they were not ready to stop drinking. Thus, a commitment to a goal of abstinence is an extremely high criterion for engaging individuals in treatment for AUD and determining whether alcohol treatment is successful. Drinking reductions, short of abstinence, are associated with considerable improvements in both health and functioning in general population and treatment samples.

- **Broadening the definition of "success"**: Broadening this definition in AUD treatment to include reduced drinking could decrease the public health burden of AUD by engaging more individuals in treatment for the disorder and would provide more options for clinicians to offer patients, beyond recommending abstinence from alcohol.

### Stability of drinking reductions and long-term functioning among patients with alcohol use disorder [^114wWWPD]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

- **Methods**:

Participants and procedures: We used data from the COMBINE Study and the outpatient sample of Project MATCH, two multi-site randomized clinical trials. Participants in the analyses met criteria for AUD, received outpatient treatment, and constituted the subgroup of participants who were followed for up to 3 years post-treatment (COMBINE: n = 694; MATCH: n = 806). Exclusion criteria for both studies included a drug use disorder (other than nicotine or cannabis), a psychiatric disorder requiring medication, or an unstable medical condition.

- **COMBINE Study**: Participants in the COMBINE Study (n = 1383) met criteria for alcohol dependence based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) (fourth edition) and engaged in heavy drinking prior to the baseline assessment. Participants were randomized into one of nine treatment cells and received 16 weeks of treatment via a 2 × 2 × 2 design, with eight of nine cells receiving (1) active naltrexone (100 mg/day) or placebo naltrexone, (2) active acamprosate (3000 mg/day) or placebo acamprosate, and (3) medication management (MM) or combined behavioral intervention (CBI) with MM. The ninth cell received CBI and no pills.

Follow-up assessments were completed at the end of treatment (16 weeks post-randomization) and at 156 weeks post-randomization. Of the 1383 participants in the COMBINE trial, 874 patients from nine sites (n = 1144; 76.4%) consented to a longer-term follow-up, of whom 694 (79%) provided data at the 3-year assessment.

### Pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115VWcqA]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

Alcohol use disorder affects more than 28.3 million people in the United States and is associated with increased rates of morbidity and mortality.

- **Objective**: To compare the efficacy and comparative efficacy of therapies for alcohol use disorder.

- **Data sources**: PubMed, the Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Central Trials Registry, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and EMBASE were searched from November 2012 to September 9, 2022. The literature was systematically monitored to identify relevant articles up to August 14, 2023, and the PubMed search was updated on August 14, 2023.

- **Study selection**: For efficacy outcomes, randomized clinical trials of at least 12 weeks' duration were included. For adverse effects, randomized clinical trials and prospective cohort studies that compared drug therapies and reported health outcomes or harms were included.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Two reviewers evaluated each study, assessed risk of bias, and graded the strength of evidence. Meta-analyses used random-effects models. Numbers needed to treat were calculated for medications with at least moderate strength of evidence for benefit.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was alcohol consumption. Secondary outcomes included motor vehicle crashes, injuries, quality of life, function, mortality, and harms.

- **Results**: Data from 118 clinical trials and 20,976 participants were included. The numbers needed to treat to prevent one person from returning to any drinking were 11 (95% CI, 1–32) for acamprosate and 18 (95% CI, 4–32) for oral naltrexone at a dose of 50 mg/d.

### Treatment interventions to maintain abstinence from alcohol in primary care: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115HFP1U]. BMJ (2020). Low credibility.

Our findings align with previous systematic reviews that support the use of acamprosate in detoxified patients with alcohol dependency and are in line with recommended guidelines. Previous reviews of interventions to maintain abstinence in alcohol-dependent patients have primarily focused on a single specific intervention or group of interventions and synthesized studies conducted in a variety of populations, making them less applicable to clinical practice. A recent systematic review and network meta-analysis, which only included five interventions, exemplifies this issue. In contrast, we included different psychosocial and drug interventions that could be implemented in primary care using network meta-analysis.

One study suggested that disulfiram is effective based on a meta-analysis of different alcohol drinking outcomes and a high heterogeneity of the studies. However, we found limited evidence to support its effect on abstinence after evaluating studies using rigorous approaches. Of all the drugs studied, disulfiram presents particular challenges in placebo-controlled blinded trials because, compared with other drugs, patients can more easily determine if they are or are not taking disulfiram.

Most interventions identified in this review were not associated with sufficient evidence to make recommendations in clinical practice, although many are promising and should be investigated in future trials. The findings also provide directions for potential strategies by including additional interventions to complement existing approaches.

### Real-world effectiveness of pharmacological treatments of alcohol use disorders in a Swedish nation-wide cohort of 125 556 patients [^1132NyAm]. Addiction (2021). Low credibility.

- **Adjusted hazard ratios**: Figure 1 displays the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk of hospitalization due to alcohol use disorder (AUD) during pharmacotherapy compared with no use of medication in within‐individual analyses. Results were significant after Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons at a 0.05 threshold.

- **Risk of hospitalization - any cause**: Figure 2 illustrates the risk of hospitalization due to any cause during follow‐up in the within‐individual model. Results were significant after Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons at a 0.05 threshold.

During the follow‐up, 3173 (2.5%) of the patients were hospitalized due to alcohol‐related somatic causes. Polytherapy was associated with a significantly decreased risk of hospitalization due to alcohol‐related somatic causes (HR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.12–0.83) compared with no use of AUD medications. In addition, disulfiram monotherapy was associated with a significantly decreased risk of hospitalization due to alcohol‐related somatic causes (HR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.42–0.89).

- **Risk of hospitalization - alcohol-related somatic causes**: Figure 3 reports the risk of hospitalization due to alcohol‐related somatic causes during exposure to studied medications, with all combinations grouped under the 'polytherapy' category due to the low rate of events. Nalmefene monotherapy was not analyzed due to the small number of events. Results were significant after Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons at a 0.05 threshold, considering hospitalization due to alcohol‐related somatic diagnoses (ICD‐10: E51.2, E24.4, G31.2, G40.51, G62.1, G72.1, I42.6, K29.2, K70, K85.2, K86.0).

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^114vJM3F]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically concerning indications for pharmacotherapy in an outpatient setting, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of preventative pharmacotherapy. This is particularly advisable in an outpatient setting, at the discretion of providers with extensive experience in managing alcohol withdrawal, for patients at risk of severe or complicated withdrawal or complications thereof.

Benzodiazepines should be administered as first-line therapy to reduce signs and symptoms of withdrawal, including the incidence of seizures and delirium. Phenobarbital is suggested as an alternative option for providers experienced with its use. If benzodiazepines are contraindicated, either administer phenobarbital or transfer patients to a more intensive level of care.

### Oral vs extended-release injectable naltrexone for hospitalized patients with alcohol use disorder: A randomized clinical trial [^113gtSPU]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

- **Question**: What is the comparative effectiveness of initiating oral vs extended-release injectable naltrexone on heavy drinking (defined as 5 or more drinks for men and 4 or more drinks for women) among hospitalized patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD)?

- **Findings**: In this randomized clinical trial including 248 adults, there was not a statistically significant difference between groups in the 3-month change in the percentage of heavy drinking days in the past 30 days. The oral naltrexone group showed a 38.4-percentage point decrease, while the extended-release injectable naltrexone group showed a 46.4-percentage point decrease.

- **Meaning**: Hospitalization represents an opportunity to start AUD pharmacotherapy. Given their similar effectiveness, the choice between oral and extended-release injectable naltrexone should be directed by practical factors, such as patient preference and affordability.

### Treatment interventions to maintain abstinence from alcohol in primary care: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113p2JZX]. BMJ (2020). Low credibility.

Overview of studies:

Supplement 5 shows the characteristics of the 64 included studies, which were published over a period of 35 years (1986–2020). In all but one study, participants started the trial after detoxification; in the remaining study, the intervention was started during detoxification. The methods and settings of detoxification were poorly reported. Most studies stated only that patients were detoxified, without specifying the details. In studies that did report the methods of medically assisted detoxification, patients were commonly detoxified with benzodiazepines, with a third study reporting inpatient detoxification.

Despite variation in inclusion and exclusion criteria, the characteristics of participants were similar across studies: predominantly men, aged around 40, and presenting with mild to moderate mental illness, such as anxiety and depression. Only four studies recruited specific populations: people with depression or sleep disturbance, elderly people, and women. No information was provided on the use of existing drugs or additional drugs in most trials; if provided, patients were usually not allowed to use or had limited use of additional antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anxiolytics, and hypnotics during the trials.

- **Drug interventions**: The most studied type of intervention, with 51 out of 64 studies focusing on this aspect.
- **Psychosocial interventions**: Six studies investigated seven forms of psychosocial interventions, including the Addiction‐Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System and cognitive behavioral therapy.

### The American Psychiatric Association practice guideline for the pharmacological treatment of patients with alcohol use disorder [^114qDANM]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2018). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol use disorder, more specifically with respect to disulfiram, the APA 2018 guidelines recommend considering offering disulfiram to patients with moderate-to-severe alcohol use disorder who:

- **Have a goal of achieving abstinence**: These individuals aim for complete cessation of alcohol use.

- **Prefer disulfiram or are intolerant to or not responding to naltrexone and acamprosate**: This is relevant for those who either choose disulfiram or cannot tolerate or do not benefit from naltrexone and acamprosate.

- **Are capable of understanding the risks of alcohol consumption while taking disulfiram**: Patients must be aware of the potential dangers involved with alcohol intake while on disulfiram.

- **Do not have contraindications to the use of disulfiram**: It is essential for patients to be screened for any contraindications that may preclude the use of disulfiram safely.

### Emergency department-initiated oral naltrexone for patients with moderate to severe alcohol use disorder: A pilot feasibility study [^114GuzXT]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Patients who were initially too intoxicated to consent for study participation were reassessed for sobriety and ability to consent by the CRC throughout the course of their ED stay. Patients displaying symptoms of alcohol withdrawal were treated according to a standardized ED protocol and were offered admission to a medically managed detoxification program or hospital, depending on the severity of their withdrawal symptoms. Patients with a history of withdrawal who did not wish to undergo medically managed detoxification but were still interested in reducing their alcohol intake were eligible for study participation.

Patients were excluded from study participation if they:

- **History of self-reported opioid use disorder or scored greater than zero on the DAST-10**: Where the primary drug reported was an opioid.
- **Present or anticipated need for opioid medications for pain**.
- **Admitted for alcohol detoxification or other medical and/or psychiatric reasons**.
- **Too intoxicated to consent**.
- **Pregnant or breastfeeding**.

Patients were also excluded if they had cirrhosis by past medical history or self-report because FDA labeling of oral naltrexone indicates that hepatic impairment can significantly alter naltrexone bioavailability and dose-related hepatotoxicity.

### Supervised disulfiram should be considered first-line treatment for alcohol use disorder [^115Q6Zrt]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Despite the prevalence of alcohol use disorder (AUD) in the United States, the armamentarium of FDA-approved medications available for AUD treatment is remarkably small. Disulfiram, one of only three approved medications, is consistently designated as a second-line option in national treatment guidelines, citing inconsistent evidence, lack of patient preference, and safety concerns. These concerns, however, stem from a misguided interpretation of the evidence that exclusively relies upon double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

When viewed instead as both a medication and a behavioral intervention, open-label RCTs become a more appropriate research method, yielding overwhelmingly favorable efficacy data for disulfiram, and supervised disulfiram, in particular. With these data in mind, supervised disulfiram should be redesignated as a first-line intervention in both treatment guideline creation and clinical pathway tools. The addiction medicine community can no longer afford to neglect this critical therapeutic resource.

### Meta-analysis of naltrexone and acamprosate for treating alcohol use disorders: When are these medications most helpful [^1111ptfT]. Addiction (2013). Low credibility.

Although debates over the efficacy of oral naltrexone and acamprosate in treating alcohol use disorders tend to focus on their global efficacy relative to placebo or their efficacy relative to each other, the underlying reality may be more nuanced. This meta-analysis examined when naltrexone and acamprosate are most helpful by testing:

- **Relative efficacy**: The relative efficacy of each medication given its presumed mechanism of action (reducing heavy drinking versus fostering abstinence).
- **Implementation factors**: Whether different ways of implementing each medication (required abstinence before treatment, detoxification before treatment, goal of treatment, length of treatment, dosage) moderate its effects.

A systematic literature search identified 64 randomized, placebo-controlled, English-language clinical trials completed between 1970 and 2009 focused on acamprosate or naltrexone.

- **Results**: Acamprosate had a significantly larger effect size than naltrexone on the maintenance of abstinence, and naltrexone had a larger effect size than acamprosate on the reduction of heavy drinking and craving. For naltrexone, requiring abstinence before the trial was associated with larger effect sizes for abstinence maintenance and reduced heavy drinking compared with placebo. For acamprosate, detoxification before medication administration was associated with better abstinence outcomes compared with placebo.

In the treatment for alcohol use disorders, acamprosate has been found to be slightly more efficacious in promoting abstinence, and naltrexone slightly more efficacious in reducing heavy drinking.

### Stability of drinking reductions and long-term functioning among patients with alcohol use disorder [^115vDFdC]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

The World Health Organization (WHO) categorizes alcohol consumption into low-, medium-, high-, and very-high-risk drinking levels (RDLs) based on grams consumed. Although abstinence has been considered the ideal outcome of alcohol treatment, reductions in WHO RDLs have been proposed as primary outcomes for alcohol use disorder (AUD) trials.

The study examines the stability of WHO RDL reductions and the association between RDL reductions and long-term functioning for up to 3 years following treatment. This is a secondary data analysis of patients with AUD enrolled in the COMBINE Study and Project MATCH, two multi-site, randomized AUD clinical trials, who were followed for up to 3 years post-treatment (COMBINE: n = 694; MATCH: n = 806).

- **Measures**: Alcohol use was measured via calendar-based methods. We estimated all models in the total sample and among participants who did not achieve abstinence during treatment.
- **Key results**: One-level RDL reductions were achieved by 84% of patients at the end of treatment, with 84.9% of those individuals maintaining that reduction at a 3-year follow-up. Two-level RDL reductions were achieved by 68% of patients at the end of treatment, with 77.7% of those individuals maintaining that reduction at a 3-year follow-up. One- and two-level RDL reductions at the end of treatment were associated with significantly better mental health, quality of life (including physical quality of life), and fewer drinking consequences 3 years after treatment (p < 0.05), as compared to no change or increased drinking.

### Diagnosis and pharmacotherapy of alcohol use disorder: A review [^114TwxyN]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

- **Importance**: Alcohol consumption is associated with 88,000 US deaths annually. Although routine screening for heavy alcohol use can identify patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and has been recommended, only 1 in 6 US adults report ever having been asked by a health professional about their drinking behavior. Alcohol use disorder, a problematic pattern of alcohol use accompanied by clinically significant impairment or distress, is present in up to 14% of US adults during a 1-year period, although only about 8% of affected individuals are treated in an alcohol treatment facility.

- **Observations**: Four medications are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat AUD: disulfiram, naltrexone (oral and long-acting injectable formulations), and acamprosate. However, patients with AUD most commonly receive counseling. Medications are prescribed to less than 9% of patients who are likely to benefit from them, given evidence that they exert clinically meaningful effects and their inclusion in clinical practice guidelines as first-line treatments for moderate to severe AUD. Naltrexone, which can be given once daily, reduces the likelihood of a return to any drinking by 5% and binge-drinking risk by 10%. Randomized clinical trials also show that some medications approved for other indications, including seizure disorder (e.g. topiramate), are efficacious in treating AUD. Currently, there is not sufficient evidence to support the use of pharmacogenetics to personalize AUD treatments.

- **Conclusions and relevance**: Alcohol consumption is associated with a high rate of morbidity.

### Pharmacotherapy for adults with alcohol use disorders in outpatient settings: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^11371CXP]. JAMA (2014). High credibility.

Alcohol use disorders cause substantial morbidity and early mortality yet remain greatly undertreated, with medications being considerably underused.

- **Objective**: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the benefits and harms of medications — both US FDA-approved and others — for adults with alcohol use disorders.

- **Data sources**: PubMed, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, FDA website, and clinical trials registries (January 1, 1970, to March 1, 2014).

- **Study selection**: Two reviewers selected randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with at least 12 weeks' duration that reported eligible outcomes and head-to-head prospective cohort studies reporting health outcomes or harms.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: We conducted meta-analyses using random-effects models and calculated numbers needed to treat for benefit (NNTs) or harm (NNHs).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Alcohol consumption, motor vehicle crashes, injuries, quality of life, function, mortality, and harms.

- **Results**: We included 122 RCTs and 1 cohort study (total 22,803 participants). Most studies assessed acamprosate (27 studies, n = 7519), naltrexone (53 studies, n = 9140), or both. The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent return to any drinking for acamprosate was 12 (95% CI, 8 to 26; risk difference [RD], -0.09; 95% CI, -0.14 to -0.04) and was 20 for oral naltrexone (50 mg/d) (95% CI, 11 to 500; RD, -0.05; 95% CI, -0.10 to -0.002). The NNT to prevent return to heavy drinking was 12 for oral naltrexone (50 mg/d) (95% CI, 8 to 26; RD -0.09; 95% CI, -0.13 to -0.04). Meta-analyses of trials comparing acamprosate to naltrexone found no statistically significant differences.

### Executive summary of the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^111UhY7w]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) Clinical Practice Guideline on Alcohol Withdrawal Management provides guidance on the identification and management of alcohol withdrawal in adults with varying degrees of syndrome severity. The guideline addresses both ambulatory and inpatient care and considers special patient populations. It was primarily developed following the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method (RAM), a process to determine the appropriateness of a set of clinical procedures.

This process included a review of gray and empirical literature published between January 2012 and October 2017. Nineteen existing guidelines, 112 reviews, and 150 research studies were used to develop draft guideline statements, which were assessed by a panel of physicians experienced in withdrawal management and representing a diverse range of settings and patient populations. Recommendations were included in the guideline where consensus on appropriate clinical practice was identified by the panel. Areas where additional research would provide valuable information for determining best practices were highlighted.
