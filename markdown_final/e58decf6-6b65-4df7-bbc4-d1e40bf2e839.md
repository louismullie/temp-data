## Question

Sex return after mi

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when and how to resume sexual activity after myocardial infarction, including risk stratification, timing, counseling, medications, and special populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the cardiovascular physiology of sexual activity and how to translate that into practical risk. Then, I should verify guideline-based timing for resumption in uncomplicated versus complicated MI. Next, I will examine how to stratify patients into low, intermediate, or high risk and what testing to order. After that, I need to outline the essential elements of counseling, including symptom thresholds and medication cautions. I will then consider sex-specific and partner-inclusive issues, followed by the role of cardiac rehabilitation. Finally, I should review the evidence on sexual activity and long-term outcomes and synthesize a concise, actionable recommendation with safety caveats and follow-up checkpoints.

> Let me first confirm the physiologic demands of sexual activity so I don't overstate risk. Sexual intercourse typically requires about 3 to 5 metabolic equivalents of task, roughly equivalent to brisk walking or climbing a flight of stairs, with transient rises in heart rate, blood pressure, and sympathetic tone; importantly, the cardiovascular response is brief and generally well tolerated in appropriately selected patients, which frames the safety discussion and the "stair-climbing" analogy often used at the bedside [^112Ab9eN] [^116hBsAW].

> Now, I should verify timing recommendations for resumption after an uncomplicated MI. Contemporary consensus statements indicate that if a patient is asymptomatic during mild to moderate physical activity, it is reasonable to resume sexual activity as early as 1 to 2 weeks after an uncomplicated MI, with a gradual progression from less strenuous intimacy to intercourse as tolerated; this is echoed in guideline discharge education templates that explicitly include plans for resuming sexual activity alongside physical activity and work [^113uiyHP] [^1144Mu9W] [^11289CUY].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to ensure we stratify risk before giving a blanket "go ahead". Patients who can perform exercise at greater than 3 to 5 METs without angina, excessive dyspnea, ischemic ECG changes, hypotension, or arrhythmia are generally at low risk for coital events, whereas those with unstable symptoms, decompensated heart failure, or high-risk features should defer sexual activity until stabilized; for intermediate-risk patients, exercise testing can clarify ischemia and guide safe resumption, aligning with the Princeton framework adapted for cardiac patients [^111q4t1U] [^111jchLL] [^113uiyHP].

> Wait, let me verify the absolute risk so counseling is balanced. Meta-analytic data show that episodic sexual activity is associated with a transient relative risk increase for MI of about 2.1 to 2.7 in the hour following activity, but the absolute risk is extremely low at roughly 2 to 3 per 10,000 person-years for an additional hour of sexual activity per week; moreover, this risk is markedly attenuated in individuals with higher habitual physical activity levels, reinforcing the protective role of fitness and cardiac rehabilitation [^115WrtSi] [^113wqdNB].

> Next, I should review what to include in counseling so patients and partners have actionable guidance. I need to ensure we discuss symptom thresholds that should prompt stopping and seeking care, such as chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, dizziness, or unusual fatigue during or after sex; I should also confirm nitrate safety, including the instruction that if chest pain occurs during sex, sublingual nitroglycerin can be used if not on PDE5 inhibitors, and if pain persists beyond about 5 minutes, emergency services should be contacted; if a PDE5 inhibitor has been used, nitrates are contraindicated and emergency care must be sought immediately, with explicit mention of the nitrate–PDE5 interaction and the need for a 48-hour washout if nitrates are medically necessary in an emergency [^116QgTLZ] [^112ru4BM] [^111hApXV].

> I will now examine medication-related issues that commonly derail safe return to sex. PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil and tadalafil are effective for erectile dysfunction but must not be coadministered with nitrates due to the risk of profound hypotension; labels also advise caution in patients with recent MI, unstable angina, uncontrolled arrhythmias, or recent stroke, and clinicians should individualize decisions and discuss emergency plans if chest pain occurs after dosing; importantly, postmarketing reports of serious cardiovascular events exist but causality is confounded by underlying disease and concurrent activity, so shared decision-making and risk mitigation are key [^112PEmWq] [^111hApXV] [^1166b7JZ].

> Let me consider sex-specific and partner-inclusive aspects because women and couples often face distinct barriers. Women report higher rates of loss of sexual activity after MI and are less likely to receive counseling; qualitative work shows many resume sex within 4 weeks despite fear, and they prefer private, clinician-initiated discussions that address safety, timing, and function, ideally started by the cardiologist and reinforced in rehabilitation; partners frequently share fears and may benefit from joint counseling to prevent avoidance and overprotection that erodes intimacy [^112sbTs3] [^1148vmkZ] [^1147gSXK] [^111649Ks].

> I should double-check the role of cardiac rehabilitation because it materially changes risk and confidence. Guidelines endorse cardiac rehabilitation to improve exercise capacity and reduce coital cardiovascular risk, with structured exercise training lowering peak coital heart rate and improving tolerance; sexual rehabilitation components, including education, pelvic floor strategies, and psychosexual support, can further enhance function and safety, and CR referral should be routine unless contraindicated [^113yNwZh] [^113q9BrD] [^1168Tdg5].

> But wait, what about long-term outcomes and whether sexual activity itself signals better prognosis. Observational longitudinal data suggest an inverse association between frequency of sexual activity and mortality after MI, with the lowest mortality among those most sexually active; while confounding by baseline health is likely, the signal supports encouraging safe, desired sexual activity as part of comprehensive recovery and quality of life, provided risk is appropriately stratified and managed [^115pw9dh].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and make sure I haven't missed anything critical. For an uncomplicated MI, if the patient is asymptomatic with mild exertion, it is reasonable to resume sexual activity in 1 to 2 weeks, starting with low-exertion intimacy and progressing based on tolerance; for complicated courses or persistent symptoms, defer until stabilization and consider exercise testing to guide clearance; always provide written and verbal counseling on warning symptoms, nitrate use, and PDE5 precautions; involve partners when possible; and arrange cardiac rehabilitation to build capacity and confidence, with follow-up to reassess concerns and function at 1 month and beyond [^113uiyHP] [^1144Mu9W] [^113yNwZh].

> Finally, I should confirm the key safety caveats so there is no ambiguity. Sexual activity is generally safe at 3 to 5 METs in appropriately selected, stable patients; the absolute risk of a coital MI is very low but higher in sedentary individuals, which is why conditioning matters; nitrate therapy and PDE5 inhibitors must not be combined; and any new or worsening cardiac symptoms during sex warrant immediate cessation and medical evaluation, with emergency services called if symptoms persist or are severe [^111q4t1U] [^115WrtSi] [^112PEmWq] [^116QgTLZ].

---

Sexual activity can **safely resume** after myocardial infarction (MI) once the patient is clinically stable, asymptomatic, and able to perform mild-to-moderate physical activity (about 3–5 METs) [^111q4t1U] without symptoms [^111q4t1U]. Most patients can return to sex **within 1–2 weeks** after an uncomplicated MI, but timing should be individualized based on recovery, symptoms, and risk factors [^113uiyHP]. The risk of sex-triggered cardiac events is low (about 1% of MIs) [^112Ab9eN] and is further reduced by regular physical activity and cardiac rehabilitation [^113q9BrD] [^115WrtSi]. Patients should start slowly, avoid sex after heavy meals or alcohol, and use nitroglycerin if angina occurs — but never combine nitrates with PDE5 inhibitors due to severe hypotension risk [^112PEmWq]. Counseling on safe return to sex is recommended for all patients and partners [^112Q4rej].

---

## Physiological considerations

Sexual activity increases heart rate, blood pressure, and myocardial oxygen demand [^116Rp49f], roughly equivalent to climbing two flights of stairs or walking briskly (3–5 METs) [^112Ab9eN]. In stable patients, this demand is **generally safe** [^113uiyHP]; in those with unstable coronary disease, it may provoke ischemia or arrhythmias [^112Ab9eN].

---

## Risk of sexual activity after MI

The risk of sex-triggered cardiac events is low: sexual activity accounts for about 1% of MIs [^112Ab9eN], with a transient 2–3-fold relative risk during activity [^115WrtSi] and an **absolute risk of about 2–3 per 10,000 person-years** [^115WrtSi]. This risk is lower in physically active patients and rises with sedentary lifestyle or poor cardiac reserve [^115WrtSi] [^111q4t1U].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines provide **clear recommendations** for resuming sexual activity after MI:

- **Timing**: Sexual activity is reasonable ≥ 1 week after uncomplicated MI if the patient is asymptomatic during mild-to-moderate physical activity (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C) [^113uiyHP] [^1144Mu9W].

- **Individualization**: Timing should be individualized based on exercise capacity, post-procedural healing, and patient preferences [^112eXRo1] [^112Ab9eN].

- **Gradual resumption**: Start with less strenuous activities (e.g. fondling, kissing) and progress gradually to intercourse as tolerated [^113uiyHP] [^111c89xK].

- **Exercise capacity threshold**: Patients who can exercise at > 3–5 METs without symptoms are generally safe to resume sexual activity [^111q4t1U].

---

## Factors influencing safe return to sexual activity

Several factors influence the **safe resumption** of sexual activity after MI:

| **Factor** | **Influence on safe return** |
|-|-|
| Clinical stability | Patients must be asymptomatic and clinically stable before resuming sexual activity [^113uiyHP] |
| Exercise capacity | Ability to perform mild-to-moderate physical activity without symptoms is a key determinant [^111q4t1U] |
| Type of MI | Uncomplicated MI allows earlier return; complicated MI (e.g. heart failure, arrhythmias) requires longer recovery [^113uiyHP] [^111q4t1U] |
| Cardiac rehabilitation participation | Strongly associated with safer and earlier return to sexual activity [^113q9BrD] [^1115pj2n] |
| Medications | Beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and statins do not preclude sexual activity; PDE5 inhibitors are contraindicated with nitrates [^112PEmWq] [^117TPG8K] |

---

## Psychological and emotional considerations

Many patients experience anxiety, depression, and fear of recurrence after MI, which can reduce sexual desire and function [^115ug11L]. Psychological counseling and open communication with partners are **essential** to address these concerns and facilitate a safe return to sexual activity [^112Q4rej].

---

## Role of cardiac rehabilitation

Cardiac rehabilitation programs significantly improve exercise capacity, reduce cardiovascular risk, and enhance confidence, thereby facilitating **safe resumption of sexual activity** [^113q9BrD]. Participation in cardiac rehabilitation is strongly recommended for patients recovering from MI [^notfound].

---

## Practical recommendations for patients and partners

Patients and their partners should receive **practical advice** on resuming sexual activity:

- **Timing**: Start slowly and gradually increase intensity based on comfort and symptom response [^113uiyHP].

- **Positioning**: Comfortable positions that minimize cardiac stress are recommended [^112oxjn9].

- **Medications**: Nitroglycerin can be used for angina during sex, but PDE5 inhibitors must not be combined with nitrates [^112PEmWq] [^112ru4BM].

- **Symptom monitoring**: Stop activity if chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations occur, and seek medical attention if symptoms persist [^116QgTLZ] [^111hApXV].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Sexual activity can be safely resumed after MI once patients are clinically stable and able to perform mild-to-moderate physical activity without symptoms. The risk of sex-triggered cardiac events is low and further reduced by regular physical activity and cardiac rehabilitation. Individualized counseling and education are **essential** to address patient and partner concerns and ensure a safe return to sexual activity [^112Q4rej].

Timing of Discussion

Key subthemes included immediate versus delayed implementation of an intervention and expressions of feeling overwhelmed by information at hospital discharge. Most women felt the discussion around resumption of sexual activity should be initiated on hospital discharge and then more fully explored during the aftercare continuum. Introducing the subject early in a patient's care conveyed to the patient that the physician was open to this discussion should problems arise:

"I think for a doctor to develop a comfort level with a patient, that they should be asking about it every time. Especially on the 1‐month visit, because it sets a precedent. And it could take some women more visits before they would want to open up about it. Just knowing that it's an open topic would go a long way in encouraging women to discuss it more openly". (R 6 A 50)

Content of Counseling

Women expressed the importance of identifying "risk factors" for complications from sexual activity and "how to know when it's safe to resume activity (R 16 A 49)", specifically in terms of exertion levels.

"I think what they're expecting is for their doctor to give them a timeline, like, don't do this for 4 weeks, don't do this for 6 weeks… You might have some kind of guideline for exertion, but I think that's something the doctors would have to come up with". (R 7 A 73)

"[I]t should be something that the doctors do talk to women about… when they've had a heart attack… [S]ex is strenuous and it's a lot on your heart muscles… They tell you when you have a heart attack not to run the vacuum cleaner, not to do this or that for so many months after… Why not say, as far as your sexual activity, hold off for 4 weeks until you come back?" (R 12 A 54)

Key subthemes around delivery of the counseling included patient‐centeredness and counseling that addresses the patient holistically: "He dismisses [my questions] as not being what's important to him. What's important is the heart. And it's like, I'm a whole person here (R 13 A 54)".

Introduction

Interventions to improve myocardial infarction (MI) outcomes have significantly affected the survival of the acute event. – As a result, the vast majority of people with MI (> 80% in US and European studies) survive to 1 year. – Longer‐term outcomes are less well documented, especially in the domain of sexual function. Survivors of MIs value sexuality as an important aspect of health and quality of life, and satisfaction with sexual life has been associated with a reduced risk of incident coronary heart disease.

Recent guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommend that physicians counsel patients about resuming sexual activity following an MI. – Similar guidelines for MI management from the European Society of Cardiology provide general recommendations around the timing of resumption of sexual activity. Cardiac rehabilitation guidelines include identification and management of sexual dysfunction, yet evidence‐based strategies to improve sexual outcomes following an MI, especially in women, are very limited.

The Translational Research Investigating Underlying Disparities in Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients' Health Status Registry (TRIUMPH) is a multisite, prospective, longitudinal study that followed patient outcomes for 12 months after MI hospitalization. Analysis of TRIUMPH data previously showed that a majority of men (74%) and 44% of women were sexually active in the year before their MIs, and many continued to be sexually active in the year after. However, only 47% of men and 35% of women reported receiving counseling about resuming sexual activity after an MI. Those who were not counseled on discharge were significantly less likely to be sexually active 1 year later; the magnitude of this effect was more pronounced in women.

This qualitative substudy of female TRIUMPH participants who were sexually active in the year before MI was conducted to expand on quantitative findings from the larger TRIUMPH Study. Specifically, this study aimed to more fully understand female sexual recovery following an MI and to inform design of an evidence‐based strategy to improve female sexual outcomes after MI.

### "I' M not just a heart, I' M a whole person here": a qualitative study to improve sexual outcomes in women with myocardial infarction [^1148vmkZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Little is known about recovery of female sexual function following an acute myocardial infarction (MI). Interventions to improve sexual outcomes in women are limited.

Methods and Results

Semistructured, qualitative telephone interviews were conducted with 17 partnered women (aged 43 to 75 years) purposively selected from the Translational Research Investigating Underlying Disparities in Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients' Health Status Registry to deepen knowledge of recovery of female sexual function following an acute myocardial infarction (MI) and to improve sexual outcomes in women. Sixteen women had a monogamous relationship with a male spouse; 1 had a long‐term female partner. Most women resumed sexual activity within 4 weeks of their MI. Sexual problems and concerns were prevalent, including patient and/or partner fear of "causing another heart attack". Few women received counseling about sexual concerns or the safety of returning to sex. Most women who discussed sex with a physician initiated the discussion themselves. Inquiry about strategies to improve sexual outcomes elicited key themes: need for privacy, patient‐centeredness, and information about the timing and safe resumption of sexual activity. In addition, respondents felt that counseling should be initiated by the treating cardiologist, who "knows whether your heart is safe", and then reinforced by the care team throughout the rehabilitation period.

Conclusions

Partnered women commonly resume sexual activity soon after an MI with fear but without directed counseling from their physicians. Proactive attention to women's concerns related to sexual function and the safety of sexual activity following an MI could improve post‐MI outcomes for women and their partners.

### Patterns and loss of sexual activity in the year following hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction (a United States national multisite observational study) [^113peTjw]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

A multisite observational study of sexual activity-related outcomes in patients enrolled in the TRIUMPH registry during hospitalization for an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was conducted to identify patterns and loss of sexual activity 1 year after hospitalization for AMI. Gender-specific multivariable hierarchical models were used to identify correlates of loss of sexual activity including physician counseling. Main outcome measurements included "loss of sexual activity" (less frequent or no sexual activity 1 year after an AMI in those who were sexually active in the year before the AMI) and 1-year mortality. Mean ages were 61.1 years for women (n = 605) and 58.6 years for men (n = 1,274). Many were sexually active in the year before and 1 year after hospitalization (44% and 40% of women, 74% and 68% of men, respectively). One third of women and 47% of men reported receiving hospital discharge instructions about resuming sex. Those who did not receive instructions were more likely to report loss of sexual activity (women, adjusted relative risk 1.44, 95% confidence interval 1.16 to 1.79; men, adjusted relative risk 1.27, 95% confidence interval 1.11 to 1.46). One year mortality after AMI was similar in those who reported sexual activity in the first month after AMI (2.1%) and those who were sexually inactive (4.1%, p = 0.08). In conclusion, although many patients were sexually active before AMI, only a minority received discharge counseling about resuming sexual activity. Lack of counseling was associated with loss of sexual activity 1 year later. Mortality was not significantly increased in patients who were sexually active soon after their AMI.

### Sexual counseling for individuals with cardiovascular disease and their partners: a consensus document from the American Heart Association and the ESC council on cardiovascular nursing and allied professions (CCNAP) [^113uiyHP]. Circulation (2013). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery disease, angina, and myocardial infarction (MI) recommendations indicate that sexual activity is reasonable ≥ 1 week after uncomplicated MI, when the patient is without cardiac symptoms during mild to moderate physical activity (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C), and that after an MI, it is reasonable to counsel patients to resume sexual activity gradually, starting with activities that require less exertion, such as fondling and kissing (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C). During sexual counseling, it might be reasonable to reassure patients about the low risks of coital angina in cases in which angina is not experienced during usual physical exertion. Additional context notes that if a post-MI patient is asymptomatic or has no ischemia during stress testing, he or she is at low risk for a sexual activity–triggered cardiovascular event, and that the most recent guidelines suggest that sexual activity is reasonable 1 or 2 weeks after uncomplicated MI when the patient is without cardiac symptoms during mild to moderate physical activity.

### Sexual activity and function in the year after an acute myocardial infarction among younger women and men in the United States and Spain [^112sbTs3]. JAMA Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Most younger adults who experience an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are sexually active before the AMI, but little is known about sexual activity or sexual function after the event.

Objective

To describe patterns of sexual activity and function and identify indicators of the probability of loss of sexual activity in the year after AMI.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Data from the prospective, multicenter, longitudinal Variation in Recovery: Role of Gender on Outcomes of Young AMI Patients study (conducted from August 21, 2008, to January 5, 2012) were assessed at baseline, 1 month, and 1 year. Participants were from US (n = 103) and Spanish (n = 24) hospitals and completed baseline and all follow-up interviews. Data analysis for the present study was conducted from October 15, 2014, to June 6, 2016. Characteristics associated with loss of sexual activity were assessed using multinomial logistic regression analyses.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Loss of sexual activity after AMI.

Results

Of the 2802 patients included in the analysis, 1889 were women (67.4%); median (25th-75th percentile) age was 49 (44–52) years (range, 18–55 years). At all time points, 637 (40.4%) of women and 437 (54.9%) of men were sexually active. Among people who were active at baseline, men were more likely than women to have resumed sexual activity by 1 month (448 [63.9%] vs 661 [54.5%]; P < .001) and by 1 year (662 [94.4%] vs 1107 [91.3%]; p = 0.01) after AMI. Among people who were sexually active before and after AMI, women were less likely than men to report no sexual function problems in the year after the event (466 [40.3%] vs 382 [54.8%]; P < .01). In addition, more women than men (211 [41.9%] vs 107 [30.5%]; P < .01) with no baseline sexual problems developed 1 or more incident problems in the year after the AMI. At 1 year, the most prevalent sexual problems were lack of interest (487 [39.6%]) and trouble lubricating (273 [22.3%]) among women and erectile difficulties (156 [21.7%]) and lack of interest (137 [18.8%]) among men. Those who had not communicated with a physician about sex in the first month after AMI were more likely to delay resuming sex (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.51; 95% CI, 1.11–2.05; p = 0.008). Higher stress levels (AOR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.01–1.83) and having diabetes (AOR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.15–3.13) were significant indicators of the probability of loss of sexual activity in the year after the AMI.

Conclusions and Relevance

Impaired sexual activity and incident sexual function problems were prevalent and more common among young women than men in the year after AMI. Attention to modifiable risk factors and physician counseling may improve outcomes.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to post-revascularization care (sexual health), ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend to consider advising resumption of sexual activity individually based on the type of sexual activity, exercise capacity, and postprocedural healing in patients with chronic coronary disease.

Discussion

Guidelines recommend that physicians counsel patients regarding resumption of sexual activity following an MI. – In this study, most women had resumed sexual activity within 4 weeks of their MIs, despite fear of reinfarction or death, without directed communication from their physicians regarding safety. Of those who did discuss sexual matters with their physicians, most initiated the conversation themselves, and most were dissatisfied with the quality of instructions they received.

Lack of patient–physician communication, rather than lack of information about safety, presents a major barrier to improving sexual outcomes for women after MI. Studies have repeatedly shown that sexual activity after MI is relatively safe. Studies consistently show that middle‐aged and older women and men value their sexual life and regard sex as relevant for health and appropriate for discussion with a physician, – yet major gaps in communication — especially for women — persist. Recommendations for how the topic of sex should be handled after MI varies across studies. Some recommend that the topic be handled primarily in the rehabilitation setting by cardiac rehabilitation nurses. – Other studies recommend a self‐help strategy, using educational literature or video. – Group education or couples' counseling sessions have also been recommended. One prior study suggested that, like the women we interviewed, communication about sexual matters after MI be initiated before hospital discharge and continued through aftercare. Themes from the women we interviewed pointed to some additional features of an intervention that would be effective in improving sexual outcomes for women after MI: (1) initiation of discussion by the treating cardiologist before hospital discharge, with a focus on safety to mitigate patient and partner fear, timing of resumption, and problems women might encounter; (2) attention to sexual function through the continuum of recovery; and (3) delivery in a one‐on‐one rather than a group setting. Patient and partner fear of sexual activity following MI has been demonstrated in previous studies and appears to be a major barrier that should be addressed by an intervention to improve sexual outcomes after MI. –

Very few interventions exist that are specifically designed to improve sexual outcomes for women following an MI. One important randomized, controlled trial (n = 115, 20% female) evaluated a home‐based, self‐administered videotape to increase knowledge around resuming sexual activity, decrease related anxiety, improve sexual satisfaction, and decrease time to resumption. Compared with controls who received usual care (verbal and/or written instructions on resumption of sexual activity that varied based on cardiac rehabilitation nurses' time constraints), those in the experimental group showed increased short‐term knowledge regarding sex after MI, yet had higher rates of anxiety at 1 month. No differences between groups were seen in sexual satisfaction or time to resumption of sexual activity. Based on our findings, most MI patients with sexual concerns do not initiate discussion of these with their physicians. An effective intervention to improve sexual outcomes without raising anxiety may need to be embedded in a 2‐way, physician‐initiated discussion.

Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is effective at increasing survival, decreasing subsequent cardiac events, and improving quality of life through multifaceted programming. – However, women are less likely than men to be referred to and enrolled in CR programs. – Identification of sexual dysfunction is recommended as a component of psychosocial management in CR programs, but treatment strategies are not provided. Based on our findings, an effective intervention to improve sexual outcomes for women after MI likely begins at discharge with discussion of parameters about resuming sexual activity and referral to CR. Women can only benefit from CR if they participate. Future research is needed to know whether cardiologists might promote women's participation in CR and overall recovery by initiating predischarge discussions that include issues that are salient to a woman's "whole person" recovery — like sexuality. A strategy for "whole person" training and materials for CR providers that includes but is not limited to sexual recovery after MI should also support cardiologists, primary care physicians, and gynecologists involved in long‐term care of women with a history of MI.

### Sexual activity and counseling in the first month after acute myocardial infarction among younger adults in the United States and Spain: a prospective, observational study [^114fqct3]. Circulation (2014). Low credibility.

Background

United States and European cardiovascular society guidelines recommend physicians counsel patients about resuming sexual activity after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but little is known about patients' experience with counseling about sexual activity after AMI.

Methods and Results

The prospective, longitudinal Variation in Recovery: Role of Gender on Outcomes of Young AMI Patients (VIRGO) study, conducted at 127 hospitals in the United States and Spain, was designed, in part, to evaluate gender differences in baseline sexual activity, function, and patient experience with physician counseling about sexual activity after an AMI. This study used baseline and 1-month data collected from the 2:1 sample of women (N = 2349) and men (N = 1152) ages 18 to 55 years with AMI. Median age was 48 years. Among those who reported discussing sexual activity with a physician in the month after AMI (12% of women, 19% of men), 68% were given restrictions: limit sex (35%), take a more passive role (26%), and/or keep the heart rate down (23%). In risk-adjusted analyses, factors associated with not discussing sexual activity with a physician included female gender (relative risk, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.11), age (relative risk, 1.05 per 10 years; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.08), and sexual inactivity at baseline (relative risk, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.15). Among patients who received counseling, women in Spain were significantly more likely to be given restrictions than U.S. women (relative risk; 1.36, 95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.66).

Conclusions

Very few patients reported counseling for sexual activity after AMI. Those who did were commonly given restrictions not supported by evidence or guidelines.

Resumption of Sexual Activity: Motivation and Fear

For many women, sexual activity was less frequent but nonsexual physical intimacy increased and satisfaction was higher after the MI. "I want to hold his hand more and snuggle more and have more hugs and stuff like that (R 4 A 47)". Others talked about sex after an MI as life affirming and important for regaining a sense of normalcy.

"I think the first couple of times you get to it after the heart attack, and it's with a lot of things and not just sex… you want to do it just to prove that you can and to feel normal again. You don't always want to be the lady that had the heart attack". (R 15 A 43)

"I just didn't want to be stigmatized as a heart patient at that point. So, of course, I was concerned about that and also just wanting to return to a normal life". (R 6 A 50)

Motivation

Despite prevalent themes of fear, the majority of women expressed motivation to resume sexual activity. Most had resumed sex within 4 weeks of their MIs; all but 1 had resumed within 6 months. Many women were motivated to have sex for closeness with their spouse or partner: "I think, after you have a heart attack, you want somebody close to you (R 17 A 63)". Others were mainly seeking physical pleasure ("For orgasm, basically… that's the primary goal. That's still the same [R 11 A 43]") or to please their partner ("I enjoy him having his and that's all I need (R 1 A 68]").

### Sexual counseling for individuals with cardiovascular disease and their partners: a consensus document from the American Heart Association and the ESC council on cardiovascular nursing and allied professions (CCNAP) [^116Rp49f]. Circulation (2013). Medium credibility.

Sexual counseling for individuals with cardiovascular disease — risk with sexual activity and evaluation: It can be useful to evaluate and inform patients about the level of risk related to sexual activity, and it is reasonable to encourage patients at low risk to initiate or resume sexual activity; it is also reasonable that those at high risk or those who experience cardiovascular symptoms precipitated by sexual activity defer sexual activity until their condition is stabilized or optimally managed (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B). Successful sexual counseling begins with an initial cardiovascular risk assessment, and exercise testing is recommended for patients whose symptoms are intermediate or whose risk is unclear during the initial assessment. Sexual activity as a contributor to the onset of MI occurred in only 0.9% of cases; empirical studies have shown a relative risk of MI of 2.1 at 1 hour after sexual intercourse in patients with no premonitory symptoms, and the absolute risk is extremely low at ≈2–3 per 1000 person-years associated with 1 hour of sexual activity per week. Clinically, patients should be advised that heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate normally rise with sexual activity, and this is not a cause for alarm.

Elements of an Effective Intervention: Initiation, Context, Timing and Content

Almost all women (n = 16) felt that physicians should address resumption of sexual activity following an MI. Participants' views on the elements of an effective intervention to improve sexual outcomes following an MI were summarized by the following themes.

Initiation of Discussion

Most women felt the cardiologist was the most appropriate member of the medical team to counsel patients regarding sexual activity following an MI. The cardiologist was described as "the one that would really know whether your heart is safe or not (R 12 A 54)". Some women felt that their primary care doctor or gynecologist could also be helpful in addressing sexual issues later in the continuum of care.

"Well, your cardiologist is the one who should tell you. He's the one that takes care of you while you're in the hospital, and before you leave there, he should tell you, along with his other guidelines, what his guideline is for that". (R 7 A 73)

"I think [the cardiologist] knows your health situation better than anybody, so I think he is definitely the one that should talk to you". (R 2 A 60)

"I really do think my [cardiologist] would be effective… Had she initiated discussions about it, I probably would have responded to her questions… But I think I have a good relationship with her, that I would have been comfortable discussing it had she made it a routine part of our checkups". (R 6 A 50)

Context for Discussion

Most women preferred a private conversation with their physician, rather than a group discussion. The minority who were receptive to group counseling felt this should complement physician counseling and suggested an all‐female discussion session in the context of cardiac rehabilitation.

"I know that my doctor initially tried to get me to join a women's group… like that would be an avenue where I could meet other women who had had similar experiences… But I still don't think suggesting going to a support group… is a good replacement for the doctor discussing it [sex] with you as a patient". (R 6 A 50)

"One thing that I was real pleased about with my particular care were all the different support classes that they had on nutrition and exercise… But there was nothing offered in the sexuality area. That would be one area that they might want to look into". (R 9 A 69)

Results

Specific themes emerged that detailed respondent characteristics, sexuality and recovery, issues related to resumption of sexual activity, patient–physician communication about sexual activity, and the initiation, context, timing, and content of an intervention to improve sexual outcomes following an MI.

Cooperation, Demographic, and Health Characteristics

Cooperation and refusal rates are summarized in Figure 1. Of 30 eligible female TRIUMPH patients who could be contacted, 17 were interviewed. Two interviews were discontinued by the interviewer because the respondent was too ill. Only 1 of 11 respondents who declined participation had refused the sexuality items in the larger TRIUMPH Study 12‐month interview. Refusal rates among women who were contacted by the male interviewer were slightly higher than those for the female interviewer (8 and 3, respectively); however, no woman explicitly stated that participation or refusal was based on interviewer gender.

Respondent characteristics are summarized in Table 2. Median age of participants was 60 years (range, 43 to 75 years), consistent with the age distribution in the TRIUMPH Registry. Sixteen women were married, and 1 reported a long‐term same‐sex relationship. Most respondents had a current romantic partner. Self‐reported health at the time of the interview was generally rated as good to very good. Common comorbidities included diabetes (n = 4) and "stress" (n = 4). Four women said their partners had heart disease or a history of MI.

Pre‐ and Post‐MI Sexuality: Perceived Importance, Quality, and Recovery

Women were asked to reflect on their sexual life before their MIs. Themes emerged detailing the quality and frequency of sexual activity. Most women used positive or neutral terms to describe their prior sexual life, such as "active", "very good", "routine", or "normal". In contrast with the period before their MIs, a prevalent theme of "indifference" about sex was common post‐MI: "I can take it or leave it. It's not a big thing anymore (R 1 A 68)"; "When we do have sex it's acceptable… It's okay (R 10 A 69)". Most women discussed the quality of their sexual lives post‐MI in terms of decreased frequency but improved satisfaction:

Patient–Physician Communication About Sexual Concerns After MI

The vast majority of women interviewed did not recall receiving instructions from their physicians regarding the resumption of sex post‐MI. Of the few women who did (n = 5), most initiated the discussion themselves at the time of hospital discharge. Women who received instructions were particularly concerned about the safety of returning to sex, specifically in terms of levels of exertion and timing of resumption. Respondents recounted details of instructions received at the time of discharge; many described feeling overwhelmed and dissatisfied.

"There is so much being thrown at you on what to do and what to take and this, that, and the other that it's hard to remember everything". (R 2 A 60)

"You're totally overwhelmed with what has happened to you anyway; definitely overload". (R 13 A 54)

Discussions about resuming sexual activity were described as vague:

"The day before I left the hospital I said, 'You didn't tell me when I could have relations'. So then he says, 'Well, that's going to be up to you, how you feel'. But that's not giving me an answer". (R 17 A 63)

"[The physician] was walking out the door, and I said, 'How long do I have to wait to have sex?' And then he said, 'Oh, just whenever, it's fine'. And that was about it". (R 11 A 43)

Or they were confusing:

"When I came home… I asked the doctor point‐blank when could I have sex again, because… we were really sexually active. And he said when you can climb two flights of stairs without getting out of breath. Well, I couldn't hardly climb two flights of stairs before I had a heart attack". (R 5 A 54)

Respondents also identified factors that could facilitate or act as a barrier to patient–physician communication about sexual activity following an MI (Table 3). Physician‐initiated communication and a positive patient–physician relationship were seen as facilitators. Perceived barriers to communication about sexual activity following an MI included male sex of physician and perceived physician uncertainty about patients' receptivity to discussing sexual matters.

### Sexual counselling for sexual problems in patients with cardiovascular disease [^115vy7L8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Sexual problems are common among people with cardiovascular disease. Although clinical guidelines recommend sexual counselling for patients and their partners, there is little evidence on its effectiveness.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of sexual counselling interventions (in comparison to usual care) on sexuality-related outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease and their partners.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and three other databases up to 2 March 2015 and two trials registers up to 3 February 2016.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs, including individual and cluster RCTs. We included studies that compared any intervention to counsel adult cardiac patients about sexual problems with usual care.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included three trials with 381 participants. We were unable to pool the data from the included studies due to the differences in interventions used; therefore we synthesised the trial findings narratively. Two trials were conducted in the United States and one was undertaken in Israel. All trials included participants who were admitted to hospital with myocardial infarction (MI), and one trial also included participants who had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting. All trials followed up participants for a minimum of three months post-intervention; the longest follow-up timepoint was five months. One trial (N = 92) tested an intensive (total five hours) psychotherapeutic sexual counselling intervention delivered by a sexual therapist. One trial (N = 115) used a 15-minute educational video plus written material on resuming sexual activity following a MI. One trial (N = 174) tested the addition of a component that focused on resumption of sexual activity following a MI within a hospital cardiac rehabilitation programme. The quality of the evidence for all outcomes was very low. None of the included studies reported any outcomes from partners. Two trials reported sexual function. One trial compared intervention and control groups on 12 separate sexual function subscales and used a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. They reported statistically significant differences in favour of the intervention. One trial compared intervention and control groups using a repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and concluded: "There were no significant differences between the two groups [for sexual function] at any of the time points". Two trials reported sexual satisfaction. In one trial, the authors compared sexual satisfaction between intervention and control and used a repeated measured ANOVA; they reported "differences were reported in favour of the intervention". One trial compared intervention and control with a repeated measures ANCOVA and reported: "There were no significant differences between the two groups [for sexual satisfaction] at any of the timepoints". All three included trials reported the number of patients returning to sexual activity following MI. One trial found some evidence of an effect of sexual counselling on reported rate of return to sexual activity (yes/no) at four months after completion of the intervention (relative risk (RR) 1.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26 to 2.32; one trial, 92 participants, very low quality of evidence). Two trials found no evidence of an effect of sexual counselling on rate of return to sexual activity at 12 week (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.09; one trial, 127 participants, very low quality of evidence) and three month follow-up (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.10; one trial, 115 participants, very low quality of evidence). Two trials reported psychological well-being. In one trial, no scores were reported, but the trial authors stated: "No treatment effects were observed on state anxiety as measured in three points in time". In the other trial no scores were reported but, based on results of a repeated measures ANCOVA to compare intervention and control groups, the trial authors stated: "The experimental group had significantly greater anxiety at one month post MI". They also reported: "There were no significant differences between the two groups [for anxiety] at any other time points". One trial reporting relationship satisfaction and one trial reporting quality of life found no differences between intervention and control. No trial reported on satisfaction in how sexual issues were addressed in cardiac rehabilitation services.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no high quality evidence to support the effectiveness of sexual counselling for sexual problems in patients with cardiovascular disease. There is a clear need for robust, methodologically rigorous, adequately powered RCTs to test the effectiveness of sexual counselling interventions for people with cardiovascular disease and their partners.

### "I' M not just a heart, I' M a whole person here": a qualitative study to improve sexual outcomes in women with myocardial infarction [^115J9eBy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions and Next Steps

Partnered women were sexually active soon after an MI, even with concerns of safety and issues related to sexual function. Evidence‐based strategies to improve sexual outcomes in women following an MI are needed. MI is a life‐threatening event that some patients experience as traumatic. Social cognitive theory finds self‐efficacy to be an important indicator of differences in coping after a traumatic eventthat may extend to how patients and couples cope with sexual life after MI. Patient self‐efficacy may also influence the patient–physician relationship. Development of an effective intervention might include brief assessment of patient self‐efficacy and coping style early in the course of MI care and use this information to personalize care for improvement of sexual and other outcomes. An effective intervention to improve sexual outcomes in women after an MI should be informed by additional research to gain cardiologists' input, leverage advances in health information technology that can be used for real‐time, personalized decision making and counseling support, fit efficiently into healthcare work flows, extend to other primary care providers, and be easily updated to accommodate expected advances in knowledge about treatment for female sexual dysfunction.

### Sexual activity and concerns in people with coronary heart disease from a population-based study [^112pX3kj]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Among those who were sexually active, we found no differences in the frequency of intercourse and other sexual behaviour. Additionally, the differences in concern about different aspects of sex between people with and without CHD were small. This strongly suggests that the primary issue among older people with CHD is whether or not they resume sexual activity following diagnosis, not the behaviours of those who are sexually active. Quantitative and qualitative research indicates that only a minority of patients receive advice about resumption of sexual activity following MI or cardiac surgery, despite guidance issued by the European Society of Cardiology and the American Heart Association. A large multicentre study of younger patients showed that many patients are given advice about resuming sexual activity after acute MI that is not consistent with guidelines, including recommendations to limit the frequency of sex and take a passive role. There is a significant but very small risk that sexual activity can trigger acute cardiac events, and beliefs about such effects may be magnified in patients and their families unless healthcare staff provide appropriate advice.

Rates of sexual activity in ELSA are comparable with other contemporary studies of older people in the UK and Europe. Sexual activity rates in people with CHD have varied substantially across studies. Addis et al assessed a large sample of women aged 50 and older with CHD in 1994–1996 and found that only 39% were sexually active, compared with 49% in the present study. An analysis from the Women's Health Initiative showed that 52% of those aged 50–79 were sexually active, with no differences related to CHD. Other researchers have reported greater dissatisfaction with sex among people with CHD than those measured in the present study, but differences in measures and in the era in which data were collected make direct comparisons difficult.

We investigated the possible role of cardiac medication, but the only significant relationships were between erectile dysfunction and prescription of diuretics and statins. The association with diuretics has been observed in previous studies, but the statin effect has not. Since we tested several aspects of sexual behaviour and many different medications, the two significant associations may be chance effects. We were not able to analyse associations between phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor use and sexual activity because of small numbers.

### The cardiovascular response to sexual activity: do we know enough? [^111pVKMC]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Interest in comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation over the past 25 years spawned a series of small investigations concerning the heart rate, blood pressure, and ischemic response to sexual intercourse. This information was adequate for advising patients about return to sexual activity after a myocardial infarction or cardiac surgery. However, the introduction of medications for erectile dysfunction enabled impotent cardiac patients to engage in sexual activity and has highlighted the need for more detailed information concerning cardiovascular physiology during coitus. Review of the medical literature indicates a remarkable paucity of such data despite dramatic advances in most other aspects of cardiovascular physiology and pathophysiology. This brief paper gives an overview of the current knowledge of the cardiovascular response to sexual activity and, within the framework of advances in cardiology, highlights areas where it appears important to fill in the knowledge gap.

### Sexual counseling for individuals with cardiovascular disease and their partners: a consensus document from the American Heart Association and the ESC council on cardiovascular nursing and allied professions (CCNAP) [^116ZHraC]. Circulation (2013). Medium credibility.

Patient counseling in cardiovascular disease (CVD) — delivery, timing, and barriers are described as follows: The practice of delivering sexual counseling to patients varies both across and within countries and services, and patients after a cardiac event or stroke report wanting healthcare professionals, especially cardiologists, to discuss sexual issues with a preference for individualized counseling; some prefer information while hospitalized, whereas others prefer it later after returning to usual routines. Patients with no prior sexual activity may have no interest in initiating or discussing sex, so careful history taking is imperative to ascertain need, and reluctance can relate to sex being viewed as private or taboo; in 1 study, 69% of myocardial infarction (MI) patients stated that because sex was regarded as private it could not be discussed with friends or family. The patient's perception of the provider's knowledge, maturity, and willingness to discuss sexual issues also plays a role in facilitating discussion.

Information needs and barriers to sexual counseling — evidence suggests that information and support regarding sexual issues are not readily available to patients, and this lack of support may be attributable to both healthcare provider and patient misperceptions relating to sexual counseling after a coronary event. Findings from descriptive qualitative studies reveal that cardiac patients want and need to receive information about sexual functioning and a safe return to sexual activity related to myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, stroke, and heart failure (HF). Patients generally report a desire to receive information regarding the resumption of sexual activity and to have sexual counseling services available when sexual problems arise. Barriers to sexual counseling by healthcare professionals include an expectation that the patient does not want this information, provider inexperience, a lack of training, and time constraints, and cultural and language barriers may also inhibit sensitive discussions. Although healthcare professionals indicate some knowledge about sexual activity in cardiac populations and are willing to engage in sexual counseling, evidence suggests limited follow-through in providing such interventions to patients because of lack of confidence and specialized training as well as perceived restrictions in the practice setting and cultural background of the healthcare provider.

### Frequency of sexual activity and long-term survival after acute myocardial infarction [^115pw9dh]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous studies have shown an inverse relationship between sexual activity and mortality in the general population. We evaluated the association between sexual activity and long-term survival among patients with acute myocardial infarction.

Methods

Patients aged ≤ 65 years (n = 1120; mean age, 53) discharged from 8 hospitals in central Israel after first myocardial infarction from 1992–1993 were followed for mortality through 2015. Frequency of sexual activity was self-reported during the index hospitalization (baseline; referring to the year preceding the infarct) and after 5 and 10–13 years, along with sociodemographic and clinical data. Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to estimate the association with all-cause mortality in time-dependent sexual activity categories.

Results

At baseline, a > once per week frequency of sexual activity was reported by 42% of the patients, whereas no sexual activity was reported by 6%. After 10–13 years, the rates were 21% and 27%, respectively. Lower sexual activity was associated with older age, female sex, lack of a steady partner and more comorbidities. During follow-up, 524 deaths (47%) occurred. An inverse relationship was observed between sexual activity frequency and death, with hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 0.30 (0.23–0.38) for > once per week, 0.36 (0.28–0.46) for once per week, and 0.53 (0.42–0.66) for < once per week, compared with none. After adjusting for relevant confounding factors, the estimates were attenuated to 0.68 (0.50–0.91), 0.63 (0.48–0.83), and 0.72 (0.57–0.93), respectively (P for trend = .004).

Conclusions

Using repeated assessments of sexual activity after myocardial infarction, an inverse association was demonstrated with mortality, which was only partly accounted for by measured potential confounders.

Lifestyle modification and cardiac risk factor reduction Post-PCI

Lifestyle modification and cardiac risk factor reduction post-PCI should include promotion of smoking cessation, regular physical activity, and a healthy diet, as well as blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, lipid, and weight management. Smoking cessation therapies should be prescribed by cardiologists and initiated in hospital, as opposed to postdischarge at outpatient rehabilitation or smoking cessation clinics (however, referral to these clinics should still be made). Smoking cessation therapies with proven efficacy in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) include varenicline, bupropion (stable CVD only), combination pharmacotherapies and nicotine replacement therapies (eg, varenicline + nicotine replacement therapy), individual and telephone counseling, and combination behavioral and pharmacological interventions. The 2021 ACC/AHA/SCAI (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions) Guideline for Coronary Artery Revascularization recommends intervention for smoking cessation during hospitalization using a combination of behavioral interventions plus pharmacotherapy, with supportive follow-up for at least 1 month postdischarge.

General recommendations on the timeline to return to regular physical activity post-PCI are after 1 to 2 weeks for patients without myocardial infarction (MI) and after 6 weeks for patients with MI, with heavy lifting and strain on the access site avoided for 2 to 3 days post-PCI. However, there is a lack of evidence-based guidelines in this area. Cardiac rehabilitation can assist with gradual return to exercise. Return to sexual activity can take place several days after PCI provided revascularization was complete and there are no access site complications. Once return to regular activity is possible, all patients should be counseled to attain a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week (a minimum of 30 minutes/day for a minimum of 5 days/week) or a minimum of 75 minutes of high-intensity activity per week, if they are physically capable of doing so. At least 2 days of resistance training per week is additionally recommended.

### Sexual counseling for individuals with cardiovascular disease and their partners: a consensus document from the American Heart Association and the ESC council on cardiovascular nursing and allied professions (CCNAP) [^117D7DxU]. Circulation (2013). Medium credibility.

Sexual counseling for individuals with cardiovascular disease — both physical and psychological concerns of cardiac patients and their partners can be addressed through sexual counseling by healthcare professionals, with only a few patients needing referral and more intensive follow-up by a specially trained sex counselor. It is important that providers assess sexual problems and concerns in a timely manner and address any issues through sexual counseling and medical management where indicated. All cardiac patients should be assessed, regardless of age or gender, because those who do not have sexual concerns or require sexual counseling will generally readily admit this to the provider, thus allowing the provider to focus on those patients/partners for whom sexual concerns are apparent. The research evidence illustrates that sexual counseling is not uniformly practiced; therefore, future studies should focus on better understanding the physical and psychosexual concerns of patients and their partners. Clinical trials that test sexual counseling interventions are particularly needed, keeping in mind that time-efficient interventions are key for adoption in practice. Studies with larger sample sizes and the report of effect sizes to better understand the magnitude of the intervention are important considerations, and studies of the validated, standardized instruments used in various cardiac and stroke populations are needed to further knowledge about sexual concerns and counseling. Open-ended questions are particularly useful in understanding the nature of individual patient and partner concerns, to appropriately inform sexual counseling, therapy, or treatment. Longitudinal studies are particularly needed, because some patients and partners report continuing sexual problems for 6 to 12 months or longer after a cardiac event, and others might report changes throughout the disease trajectory. In addition to studies with patients, studies that develop and evaluate educational and counseling interventions with healthcare professionals and those with positive and useful outcomes could lead to more widespread education and use of sexual counseling in practice. The barriers to sexual counseling as noted in the present document must be addressed in the development of successful sexual counseling interventions, and greater attention to the inclusion of sexual counseling content in healthcare providers' educational programs would also facilitate greater adoption of sexual counseling in practice. All members of the healthcare team must be prepared to address sexual issues, whether responding in relation to drug interactions as a pharmacist, to the physical risks of sexual activity as the physical therapist, or in a discussion of when and how to resume sexual activity as the physician or nurse. Therefore, future research must focus on patients and their partners, as well as healthcare professionals, to both understand sexual concerns and to develop strategies to ensure that sexual counseling is a part of routine practice.

Cardiac and stroke populations — sexual assessment and counseling recommendations indicate that structured counseling strategies to address psychosocial needs can be useful (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C), and instruments to assess patients' sexual concerns can be beneficial (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C). Assessment should include response to treatment, previous medical history, and the couple's concerns about resuming sexual activity; coexisting conditions such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and HF may influence return to sexual activity, and vascular changes and reduced exercise endurance may affect sexual performance.

### Sexual activity as a trigger of myocardial infarction. A case-crossover analysis in the stockholm heart epidemiology programme (SHEEP) [^113wqdNB]. Heart (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate sexual activity as a trigger of myocardial infarction and the potential effect modification of physical fitness.

Design

A case-crossover study nested in the Stockholm Heart Epidemiology Programme (SHEEP).

Setting

Stockholm County from April 1993 to December 1994.

Patients

All patients with a first episode of non-fatal acute myocardial infarction admitted to coronary care units were eligible, and 699 patients participated in an interview.

Main Outcome Measures

Relative risks with 95% confidence intervals.

Results

Only 1.3% of the patients without premonitory symptoms had sexual activity during two hours before the onset of myocardial infarction. The relative risk of myocardial infarction was 2.1 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7 to 6.5) during one hour after sexual activity, and the risk among patients with a sedentary life was 4.4 (95% CI 1.5 to 12.9).

Conclusions

The increased risk of myocardial infarction after sexual activity and the further increase in risk among the less physically fit support the hypothesis of causal triggering by sexual activity. However, the absolute risk per hour is very low, and exposure is relatively infrequent. Thus having sex once a week only increases the annual risk of myocardial infarction slightly. Counselling should focus on encouraging patients to live a physically active life and not on abstaining from sexual activity.

Finally, we did not address whether the RCTs measured gender as a study variable. Sex and gender are often erroneously used and/or measured interchangeably in healthcare research. Given that sex and gender are not independent of each other, solely assessing one or the other cannot account for identified variations in health. 11, 22 Gender, independent of sex, has been shown to be associated with poor outcomes after early acute coronary syndrome. 11 Different family, social, and institutional roles and attitudes of men and women in recent decades play a role in the symptom presentation of acute myocardial infarction as well as time to treatment. A wide range of behavioral factors; psychosocial processes; and personal, cultural, and societal factors can create, suppress, or amplify underlying biological health differences. How gender intersects with other social factors such as race, age, ethnicity, culture, and sexual orientation is critical to delivering a personalized health approach for every patient. Unless researchers begin to routinely report on gender, this variable cannot be incorporated into CPGs. The routine integration of a gender‐based framework into health research is a necessary requirement to advance this field. 23

Post–cardiac surgery and transplantation sexual activity guidance states that cardiac surgery patients can generally resume sexual activity 6 to 8 weeks after CABG or noncoronary open heart surgery with a well-healed sternotomy incision, and that among patients who have had incomplete coronary revascularization, stress testing may be needed before they resume sexual activity; after cardiac transplantation, if a patient can perform mild to moderate levels of physical activity without symptoms, he or she can likely tolerate the physical exertion required with sexual activity.

Cardiovascular disease sexual activity — general fitness thresholds and risk counseling states that sexual activity is reasonable for patients who can exercise at > 3 to 5 METs without angina, excessive dyspnea, ischemic ST-segment changes, cyanosis, hypotension, or arrhythmia, and that the high-risk group should receive cardiac treatment and become stabilized before the initiation or resumption of sexual activity or before any sexual dysfunction is treated. It can be suggested to patients that they begin with less strenuous sexual activities, such as fondling and kissing, and progress to activities such as mutual masturbation and oral sex to assess tolerance. Observational data note that, at a 10-year follow-up, fatal cardiovascular disease events were more than twice as common in those reporting an intermediate or low frequency of sexual intercourse, and that mortality risk was 50% lower in the group with high orgasmic frequency than in the group with low orgasmic frequency.

Chronic coronary disease — sexual activity intensity and postprocedure considerations note that "Recommendations after PCI and CABG may depend on whether femoral or radial access was performed, and whether surgery was performed in a sternal-sparing manner". "The patient should be well compensated, euvolemic, and without significant angina". Stable patients "should be considered safe for sexual activity". Sexual activity represents "approximately 3 to 5 metabolic equivalents", versus a treadmill test at "approximately 4 metabolic equivalents", and patients with unstable or decompensated CCD "should refrain from sexual activity". Sexual activity is associated with "1% of all MIs".

"It's certainly not as often as either of us would like. But you know, sometimes life gets in the way when you let it… I think we're both kind of on the same page that we'd like to get to it more often. But when we do it's very good". (R 15 A 43)

"I just think that now… things are better than they ever have been because we've committed ourselves to not allowing that part of our relationship to become routine, but to become better all the time. So I'd say it's great". (R 6 A 50)

Participants reported sexual problems both before and following their MIs, including low desire and vaginal dryness (Figure 2 A). Themes of attribution to older age, medical problems, fatigue, menopause, and medication side effects were common. Following MI, several women reported new sexual concerns attributed to the MI or related procedures: "My concern was… some positions you get in, you're flat on your bed… different positions put pressure on your chest. So that was my main concern, that [staples from open‐heart surgery] might come open (R 5 A 54)". One woman who did not resume sexual activity felt her loss of libido was due to antidepressant therapy for depression since her MI (R 9 A 69). Sexual problems experienced by respondents' partners both before and following their MIs included erectile dysfunction and low desire and sexual issues related to health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, and fatigue (Figure 2 B).

Sexual counseling in cardiovascular disease (CVD) — recommendations for healthcare professionals state that patient and spouse/partner counseling by healthcare professionals is useful to assist in resumption of sexual activity after an acute cardiac event, new CVD diagnosis, stroke, changes in chronic cardiac disease function or status, or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation, and may include the use of educational materials, such as written materials or a video provided to both patients and partners (Class I; Level of Evidence B). Training should be provided for staff working with patients with CVD in relation to taking a sexual history; counseling and communication techniques for use within a sexual counseling consultation; delivery of accurate information to patients; follow-up education or counseling; referrals to other healthcare professionals; and discussion of sexual concerns in various populations and situations (Class I; Level of Evidence C). It is reasonable to tailor sexual counseling to the individual needs of the patient, regardless of age and sex, and offer it to patients as well as partners (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B).

### Association of episodic physical and sexual activity with triggering of acute cardiac events: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115WrtSi]. JAMA (2011). Excellent credibility.

Context

Evidence has suggested that physical and sexual activity might be triggers of acute cardiac events.

Objective

To assess the effect of episodic physical and sexual activity on acute cardiac events using data from case-crossover studies.

Data Sources

MEDLINE and EMBASE (through February 2, 2011) and Web of Science (through October 6, 2010).

Study Selection

Case-crossover studies investigating the association between episodic physical or sexual activity and myocardial infarction (MI) or sudden cardiac death (SCD).

Data Extraction

Two reviewers extracted descriptive and quantitative information from each study. We calculated summary relative risks (RRs) using random-effects meta-analysis and absolute event rates based on US data for the incidence of MI and SCD. We used the Fisher P value synthesis method to test whether habitual physical activity levels modify the triggering effect and meta-regression to quantify the interaction between habitual levels of physical activity and the triggering effect.

Results

We identified 10 studies investigating episodic physical activity, 3 studies investigating sexual activity, and 1 study investigating both exposures. The outcomes of interest were MI (10 studies), acute coronary syndrome (1 study), and SCD (3 studies). Episodic physical and sexual activity were associated with an increase in the risk of MI (RR = 3.45; 95% confidence interval, 2.33–5.13, and RR = 2.70; 95% CI, 1.48–4.91, respectively). Episodic physical activity was associated with SCD (RR = 4.98; 95% CI, 1.47–16.91). The effect of triggers on the absolute rate of events was limited because exposure to physical and sexual activity is infrequent and their effect is transient; the absolute risk increase associated with 1 hour of additional physical or sexual activity per week was estimated as 2 to 3 per 10,000 person-years for MI and 1 per 10,000 person-years for SCD. Habitual activity levels significantly affected the association of episodic physical activity and MI (P < .001), episodic physical activity and SCD (P < .001), and sexual activity and MI (P = 0.04); in all cases, individuals with lower habitual activity levels had an increased RR for the triggering effect. For every additional time per week an individual was habitually exposed to physical activity, the RR for MI decreased by approximately 45%, and the RR for SCD decreased by 30%.

Conclusion

Acute cardiac events were significantly associated with episodic physical and sexual activity; this association was attenuated among persons with high levels of habitual physical activity.

Methods

Sample and Setting

The TRIUMPH study design has been previously described. – This qualitative substudy enrolled women from the TRIUMPH Registry who reported sexual activity in the year before MI. Purposive random sampling was used to select patients from the TRIUMPH Registry to enroll approximately equal numbers from 3 age groups (55 to 64, 65 to 74, and 75+ years). All participants were interviewed within 18 months of completing the TRIUMPH study (mean, 12 months) or within 30 months of their MIs (mean, 24 months). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Saint Luke's Hospital in Kansas City (TRIUMPH Study Coordinating Center) and the University of Chicago. All participants provided informed consent.

### Sexual function in female patients with unstable angina or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction [^1115pj2n]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death and disability for both women and men. The psychological impact of acute myocardial infarction, as well as the physiological effects of the illness and its medications, can have a major effect on a patient's ability to resume sexual activity.

Aim

To assess sexual activity in female patients with unstable angina or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and to study the impact of cardiovascular rehabilitation (CR) on resumption of sexual activity.

Main Outcome Measures

Doppler-echocardiographic study, exercise tolerance test (ETT), and assessment of sexual activity.

Methods

This study was conducted in the Riyadh National Hospital and included 35 female patients admitted to the intensive care unit for management of unstable angina or NSTEMI. All patients were enrolled into a CR program. All of them were interviewed for assessment of sexual activity, 12 weeks post discharge. The Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX) was used for the assessment of the severity of sexual dysfunction for patients who resumed their sexual activity.

Results

Results indicate that 48.57% of the patients resumed their sexual activity at the time of the interview. However, most of them were either not satisfied at all with their sexual activity or mostly dissatisfied. The remaining patients (51.43%) had not resumed sex yet. CR was completed by 70.59% of those resuming sex, and 38.89% of those not resuming sex. We estimated that rehabilitated patients were 3.77 times more likely to resume sexual activity than those who did not receive rehabilitation. ASEX score ranged from 19 to 30, with a mean of 24.118 ± 3.42.

Conclusion

Unstable angina and NSTEMI have a negative impact on frequency of, and satisfaction with, sexual activity, and lead to sexual dysfunction within a large number of female patients. Accurate and complete sexual instructions for both partners with specific attention paid to the woman's concerns and needs should be part of CR programs.

Heart failure (HF) recommendations — During sexual counseling, it can be beneficial to discuss resumption of sexual activity because those with compensated or mild HF (New York Heart Association class I or II) may be able to engage in sexual activity (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B). Sexual counseling of the patient with HF might reasonably include tolerance for sexual activity, as well as general strategies such as positioning, being well rested before sexual activity, and how to manage shortness of breath or other symptoms with sexual activity (Class IIb; Level of Evidence C). Sexual activity is not advised for patients with decompensated or advanced (New York Heart Association class III or IV) HF until their condition is stabilized and/or optimally managed (Class III; Level of Evidence C).

Cardiac risk assessment and safety of sexual activity in HF patients

The Second Princeton Consensus provides guidelines for assessing risk for sexual activity in patients with a cardiac history. Patients are stratified into one of three groups. Low risk includes asymptomatic patients with less than three cardiac risk factors, mild stable angina, more than 6 weeks post-myocardial infarction, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I HF or mild valvular disease. Intermediate risk includes asymptomatic patients with more than three cardiac risk factors, moderate stable angina, between 2 and 6 weeks post-myocardial infarction or NYHA class II HF. High risk includes unstable angina, uncontrolled hypertension, NYHA class III or IV HF, less than 2 weeks post-myocardial infarction or moderate–to-severe valvular dysfunction. If patients are low risk, then resuming sexual activity is recommended. If patients are high risk, then it is recommended that sexual activity be postponed until the patient is stabilized. If patients are intermediate risk, assessment with cardiac testing is recommended to allow restratification into either low or high risk. 26

Studies reporting the clinical and physiological effects of sexual activity in patients with HF are sparse. The amount of energy that is involved in sexual activity from the preorgasmic to orgasmic phase is approximately 2.0–4.0 metabolic equivalents of the tasks. This is roughly equivalent to doing easy housework or climbing a flight of stairs. 27 It is reasonable to think that HF patients who have this amount of exercise capacity can safely tolerate sexual activity. In a letter to the editor, Cremers et al. 28 reported the case of a 53-year-old man with HF and secondary pulmonary hypertension with an ambulatory hemodynamic monitor. The author demonstrated that sexual activity affected the heart differently compared to similar physical exercise. The patient did not complain of any adverse events during intercourse, yet had larger increases of right ventricular systolic pressure, right ventricular diastolic pressure and estimated pulmonary artery pressure during sexual activity compared to physical activity of similar metabolic equivalents achieved by brisk walking. This discrepancy may have been due to the psychological anticipation and sympathetic activation associated with sexual activity or the position of the patient during sexual activity and physical exercise. Right ventricular pressures in a supine HF patient may be elevated compared to a standing patient. This case report demonstrated that additional studies are needed to elucidate the physiological effects that sexual activity has on HF patients.

Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and device-related sexual activity — recommendations — Sexual counseling specific to the CABG surgical patient that addresses both physical and psychosocial concerns, including return to sexual activity, management of incisional discomfort, and encouragement of cardiac rehabilitation as a means of supporting physical activity and sexual function, can be useful (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C). It is reasonable for sexual activity to be resumed in 6 to 8 weeks after a standard CABG surgery (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B) or noncoronary open heart surgery (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C), if the sternotomy is well healed. Sexual activity may be reasonable after placement of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) (Class IIb; Level of Evidence C). During sexual counseling, it may be useful to discuss any changes in position needed with sexual activity, instructions on battery use, and protection of the drive-line from tension or the possibility of it being pulled during sexual intercourse (Class IIb; Level of Evidence C).

### "I' M not just a heart, I' M a whole person here": a qualitative study to improve sexual outcomes in women with myocardial infarction [^114JFfcP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Procedure

A semistructured interview guide (Data S1) was developed to complement data generated through the large‐scale, multisite TRIUMPH Registry, which used closed‐coded surveys (items administered with a finite set of predetermined response options) to generate quantitative observations. This substudy was designed to gain contextualized, patient‐driven understanding of communication and counseling about sexuality after an MI and to elicit themes related to the desired features of an effective intervention to address sexual outcomes following an MI.

Domains of inquiry were developed with expertise from an interdisciplinary research team (a nurse with clinical and research expertise in cardiology [C.D.], a psychologist [L.G.], a public health researcher with clinical and research knowledge about female sexuality [E.M. A.], a medical anthropologist [B.G.], and a gynecologist with clinical and survey research expertise in female sexuality in the context of aging and disease [S.T.L.]) and triangulation with quantitative results from the TRIUMPH Registry and a thorough review of the literature (Table 1). The team was supported by the TRIUMPH Study's statistician, who identified the sampling frame (K.G.), and 2 cardiologists and outcomes researchers (H.M.K. J. A.S.), who reviewed the coding and analysis process used by the team and contributed to the rigor of the interpretation, the process for data reduction, and the conclusions drawn. Data obtained from participants' TRIUMPH baseline interviews were used to characterize sociodemographic and other health characteristics.

Table 1.
Qualitative Interview Guide Domains and Example Items

A recruitment letter was mailed to eligible participants that asked for participation and included instructions on how to decline participation. Two experienced qualitative researchers (B.G. L.G.; 1 male, 1 female) conducted the interviews using the same script and interview guidelines. Interviews were serially completed to reach theme saturation (n = 17); this occurred when information gained from participants became redundant and additional interviews provided no new insights.

Audio‐recorded telephone interviews, averaging 25 minutes, were transcribed verbatim and coded, allowing the researchers to assess the added value of each interview until theme saturation occurred. Individual respondents' quotes are noted by a randomly generated number "x", noted as R x; age "y" is notated in years A y. Further deidentification was accomplished by assigning variation to respondents' age by randomly adjusting by an integer between −2 and 2.

Limitations of the Study

These findings should be interpreted in the context of potential limitations. This study was based in the United States, so it may have limited relevance in countries with different or more comprehensive models of aftercare for MI. The findings presented are based on those who agreed to participate in this research study and therefore may reflect attribution bias. Social response bias is always possible in survey research, although we did find consistency between patient responses in open‐ended interviews and the structured survey responses in the TRIUMPH Registry database. In addition, the mode of interview did not allow for collection or interpretation of nonverbal expressions. Despite broad inclusion criteria, participants in this sample were more likely than sexually active participants in the larger TRIUMPH Registry to be white and married. Also, interviews relied on recall, potentially introducing bias. However, recall bias was assessed in prior analysis, indicating no significant discrepancy between the medical record and patient recall about communication with a physician about sexual matters prior to hospital discharge.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) — psychological impact and sexual counseling states that to reduce the psychological sequelae associated with CVD, sexual counseling can be useful for most patients and their partners (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C). Depression and anxiety can have detrimental effects on sexual activity when comorbid CVD is present and should be assessed before patients engage in sexual activity, and providers should discuss fear of a cardiac event during intercourse and offer reassurance that the risk of MI with sexual activity is low.

After a cardiovascular event, patients and their families often cope with numerous changes in their lives, including dealing with consequences of the disease or its treatment on their daily lives and functioning. Coping poorly with both physical and psychological challenges may lead to impaired quality of life. Sexuality is one aspect of quality of life that is important for many patients and partners that may be adversely affected by a cardiac event. The World Health Organization defines sexual health as '… a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality; it is not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity. Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences… '(1(p4)) The safety and timing of return to sexual activity after a cardiac event have been well addressed in an American Heart Association scientific statement, and decreased sexual activity among cardiac patients is frequently reported.(2) Rates of erectile dysfunction (ED) among men with cardiovascular disease (CVD) are twice as high as those in the general population, with similar rates of sexual dysfunction in females with CVD.(3) ED and vaginal dryness may also be presenting signs of heart disease and may appear 1–3 years before the onset of angina pectoris. Estimates reflect that only a small percentage of those with sexual dysfunction seek medical care;(4) therefore, routine assessment of sexual problems and sexual counselling may be of benefit as part of effective management by physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers.

Recommendations after stroke — sexual counseling and activity: All stroke survivors and their partners should be asked about intimacy and sexual function at the time of the stroke, and then at regular intervals during follow-up after their stroke (Class I; Level of Evidence B). Sexual activity is reasonable for patients after stroke (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B). There are several resources that may be helpful to stroke survivors and their sexual partners (Table 3). This information should be offered at the time of the stroke and at regular intervals thereafter, such as at follow-up visits. It has been suggested based on an integrative review that follow-up poststroke sexual counseling occur at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 1 year after the stroke.

Estimates reflect that only a small percentage of those with sexual dysfunction seek medical care; therefore, routine assessment of sexual problems and sexual counseling may be of benefit as part of effective management by physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers. Sexual counseling is important for both cardiac patients and their partners, and returning to sexual activity is a common concern, with patients frequently requesting information on how to resume sexual activity.

### Does health status differ between men and women in early recovery after myocardial infarction? [^117V3ESv]. Journal of Women's Health (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Although much attention has been given to survival after myocardial infarction (MI), little is known about sex differences in health status (symptoms, function, and quality of life). A particularly critical moment to assess health status following an MI is early after discharge when patients have resumed routine activities and when additional treatments may be offered to those with residual angina or quality of life limitations.

Methods

We used multivariable Poisson and linear regression models to examine differences in 30-day health status by sex in a cohort of 2096 MI patients enrolled in a 19-center Prospective Registry Evaluating Myocardial Infarction: Events and Recovery (PREMIER).

Results

Women (32% of the cohort) were older and less likely to be white, married, or treated with coronary revascularization. They were more likely to have had a non-ST segment elevation MI, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, chronic lung disease, and worse health status at admission. Risk-adjusted multivariable models suggest women were slightly more likely to have angina (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.0, 1.14, p = 0.06), worse quality of life (difference in SAQ score = -4.36 points, 95% CI -5.44, -3.27 points, p = < 0.001) and poorer physical functioning (difference in SF-12 PCS = -2.55 points, 95%CI = -3.62, -1.48 points, p = < 0.001) at 30 days than men.

Conclusions

One in four patients experienced angina 1 month after their MI, and women had a slightly greater prevalence than men. The physical function and quality of life of women 30 days after an MI is similar to or worse than that of men.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of sildenafil. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion either due to their seriousness, reporting frequency, lack of clear alternative causation, or a combination of these factors.

Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular

Serious cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and vascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, ventricular arrhythmia, cerebrovascular hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack, hypertension, subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhages, and pulmonary hemorrhage have been reported post-marketing in temporal association with the use of sildenafil. Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of sildenafil without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after the use of sildenafil and sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to sildenafil, to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying cardiovascular disease, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17)].

Sexual activity and years since diagnosis

The reduction in prevalence of sexual activity among participants with CHD was related to the time since diagnosis. Men who had been diagnosed 4 or more years ago had a 19% reduction in odds of being sexually active, while those diagnosed < 4 years ago had a 76% decrease in odds compared with men free of CHD (table 2). Among women, there was no difference from controls in those diagnosed ≥ 4 years ago, but there was a 56% reduction in those with more recent diagnoses (p = 0.013). Years since diagnosis was also associated with rates of thinking about sex among men, with bigger reductions in men diagnosed < 4 years ago. A similar pattern was observed for men in relation to erectile difficulties (table 2), with a twofold increase in those diagnosed < 4 years ago.

Table 2
Sexual activity and years since diagnosis of coronary heart disease (CHD)

Sexual concerns and CHD

Table 3 summarises findings relating concerns about sexual activity and function with CHD. There was no association between CHD and concerns about level of sexual desire, frequency of sexual activity or satisfaction with sex life. The only significant difference was that more men with CHD expressed concern about orgasmic experience. Levels of sexual concerns did not differ systematically between the groups with recent or more distant diagnosis.

Table 3
Coronary heart disease (CHD) and concerns about sexual activity

Sexual activity and MI

The pattern of results was largely the same when the analysis was limited to MI. The only major difference was related to erectile difficulties. Men who had experienced an MI within the past 4 years showed a greater prevalence of erectile difficulties compared with those without disease (62.1% vs 38.7%) than in the overall CHD analysis. The adjusted odds were 3.63 (CI 1.93 to 6.84, p < 0.001). By contrast, men with MI ≥ 4 years earlier did not report excess erectile difficulty (prevalence 39.4%).

Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) recipients — sexual counseling content and observed concerns are outlined as follows: During sexual counseling, it may be reasonable to address when it is safe to resume sex, the potential for an ICD shock with sex and what to do if a shock occurs, that an ICD shock will not harm the partner, the level of sexual activity that is safe, how to deal with changes in sexual desire or function, and prepregnancy counseling for women who wish to become pregnant (Class IIb; Level of Evidence C). Observational data note a 23% decline over a 3.5-year period in return to sex after ICD implantation, with 13% reported to have received an ICD shock during sex; in a brief report 6 months after implantation (n = 31), cardiac resynchronization therapy was associated with significant reduction in erectile dysfunction, increased libido, and reduced New York Heart Association class. Counseling advice includes addressing fears, building confidence, communication, following the shock plan, explaining that an ICD shock will not injure the partner, medication adherence to protect from sinus tachycardia, reporting sexual difficulties, and encouraging return to sex to maintain relationships, quality of life, and emotional function.

Serious cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and vascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, ventricular arrhythmia, cerebrovascular hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack, hypertension, subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhages, and pulmonary hemorrhage have been reported post-marketing in temporal association with the use of sildenafil citrate. Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of sildenafil citrate without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after the use of sildenafil citrate and sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to sildenafil citrate, to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying cardiovascular disease, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17)].

PLISSIT model for addressing sexual concerns — framework and initial steps are described. PLISSIT is an acronym for the strategies or stages of giving Permission, Limited Information, Specific Suggestions, and Intensive Therapy, a model that may be useful to practitioners in addressing sexual concerns. Giving the patient or partner permission to bring up sexual issues is considered the first stage in addressing sexual concerns and is within the realm of all practitioners in all settings, which can be initiated by statements such as, "After a heart attack, patients and partners may have concerns about whether it is safe to engage in sex. What concerns do you have?" After giving permission, the next step is giving the patient limited information, providing a few instructions to assist with sexual functioning, and offering educational pamphlets.

Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery — sexual function outcomes and supportive interventions — At 3 months after CABG surgery, problems reported were limited sexual desire and responsiveness, whereas at 2 years sexual problems were reported frequently; independent predictors were preoperative sexual problems (P < 0.0001), male gender (P < 0.0001), and diabetes mellitus (P < 0.008), and overall variance in the sexual quality of life of CABG surgical patients (33%) was accounted for by patient age, disease duration, and spousal communication. In contrast, at 6 and 12 months after surgery, CABG patients (n = 89) had an increased interest in (85%) and level of (49%) sexual activity, although preoperative ratings of sexual performance and frequency of sexual contact were higher than those at 6 months (P < 0.02). Sexual satisfaction among patients (n = 63) increased over time, with an increase in sexual satisfaction from 57% to 63% when baseline levels were compared with those at levels 8 years after CABG surgery. The opportunity to have a detailed discussion with medical staff members before hospital discharge was perceived as the most important aspect for resuming sexual activity without risk, and the provision of sexual instructions after CABG surgery and sexual therapy were found to be related to resumption of sexual activity. Participation in cardiac rehabilitation resulted in an increase in sexual activity from posttreatment to 4 months (x = 3.82 versus 4.02 times per month), whereas the control group had decreased sexual activity (x = 3.34 to 2.94 times per month).

Conclusions

We found that men who were treated for ED after a first MI had a reduced risk of death and hospitalisation for heart failure. Men who were treated with PDE5-inhibitors had a markedly reduced risk of death or heart failure, which appeared to be dose dependent, whereas those with alprostadil treatment had a similar risk of adverse outcome as men with no treatment for ED. Since treatment for ED is associated with confounding by indication, meaning that healthier men are more likely to get treatment for ED, our results should be interpreted cautiously.

### Sexual activity and cardiac risk [^116hBsAW]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Endothelial dysfunction underlies both atherosclerosis and erectile dysfunction (ED). Therefore, the incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) is inevitably increased in patients with ED. Patients with ED, who are typically unable to develop or maintain an erection, are able to engage in sexual activity when treated with phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors. Acute coronary syndromes and cardiac sudden death are precipitated by either vulnerable plaque erosion or rupture, or by the development of sudden myocardial ischemia. The physical activity of sexual intercourse is associated with increased myocardial oxygen demand (MVo(2)) and increased sympathetic nervous system activation, both of which can result in myocardial ischemia in the presence of CAD. The effect of sexual activity on total body oxygen consumption (Vo(2)) and MVo(2) has been studied in the past, but not extensively. Available research shows that sexual intercourse increases Vo(2) to a modest extent. As studied, Vo(2) is increased modestly to 3 to 5 metabolic equivalents. Further, this increase in Vo(2) lasts only for a brief period. The small increase in the incidence of myocardial infarction that accompanies sexual activity within 2 hours of onset is likely related to sympathetic activation and to an increase in MVo(2). The evidence for this hypothesis is reviewed in this article.

Results

There were 2979 men and 3711 women in the study, of whom 376 (12.6%) men and 279 (7.5%) women had CHD. CHD had been diagnosed 4 or more years ago in 294 (78.2%) men and 211 (75.6%) women, and of these, 225 (68.4%) had been diagnosed ≥ 4 years previously. There were 329 MI diagnoses among the CHD cases, including 218 men and 111 women. Participants with CHD were significantly older than those without CHD (men: means 71.7 ± 9.4 vs 65.6 ± 8.7 years; women: means 73.8 ± 10.0 vs 65.1 ± 9.1 years, both p < 0.001). We found that 70.7% of men and 47.7% of women with CHD were married or living with a partner, compared with 77.7% and 65.0% of men and women without CHD (p < 0.001). Diabetes was more common in men and women with CHD than without CHD (23.5% vs 10.5% and 27.6% vs 8.5%, respectively, p < 0.001), and the number of comorbidities was significantly higher in CHD cases in both men and women (both p < 0.001). A total of 93.6% of men and 94.7% of women reported being exclusively heterosexual over their lifetimes.

5.1 Cardiovascular

Physicians should consider the cardiovascular status of their patients, since there is a degree of cardiac risk associated with sexual activity. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including tadalafil tablets, should not be used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable as a result of their underlying cardiovascular status. Patients who experience symptoms upon initiation of sexual activity should be advised to refrain from further sexual activity and seek immediate medical attention.

Physicians should discuss with patients the appropriate action in the event that they experience anginal chest pain requiring nitroglycerin following intake of tadalafil tablets. In such a patient, who has taken tadalafil tablets, where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary for a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should have elapsed after the last dose of tadalafil tablets before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should still only be administered under close medical supervision with appropriate hemodynamic monitoring. Therefore, patients who experience anginal chest pain after taking tadalafil tablets should seek immediate medical attention [see Contraindications (4.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1)].

Patients with left ventricular outflow obstruction, (e.g., aortic stenosis and idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) can be sensitive to the action of vasodilators, including PDE5 inhibitors.

The following groups of patients with cardiovascular disease were not included in clinical safety and efficacy trials for tadalafil tablets, and therefore until further information is available, tadalafil tablets are not recommended for the following groups of patients:

myocardial infarction within the last 90 days
unstable angina or angina occurring during sexual intercourse
New York Heart Association Class 2 or greater heart failure in the last 6 months
uncontrolled arrhythmias, hypotension (< 90/50 mm Hg), or uncontrolled hypertension
stroke within the last 6 months.

As with other PDE5 inhibitors, tadalafil has mild systemic vasodilatory properties that may result in transient decreases in blood pressure. In a clinical pharmacology study, tadalafil 20 mg resulted in a mean maximal decrease in supine blood pressure, relative to placebo, of 1.6/0.8 mm Hg in healthy subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. While this effect should not be of consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing tadalafil tablets, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects. Patients with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure may be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators, including PDE5 inhibitors.

Coital angina — definition and emergency management — is angina that occurs immediately after sexual activity and represents < 5% of all angina attacks. Health professionals should advise patients who have not used phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors and are experiencing postcoital angina to use nitrates and to call emergency services if the angina is still present after 5 minutes; if nitrates are not available, post-coital angina that lasts > 15 minutes should prompt a call to emergency services. For patients using PDE5 inhibitors who experience postcoital angina, emergency assistance should be summoned promptly and emergency response staff informed of PDE5 inhibitor use, because nitrate use is contraindicated; for patients using PDE5 inhibitors before sexual activity, nitrates should not be used in the event of coital angina (Class III; Level of Evidence C) and these patients should be advised to contact emergency services immediately on experiencing coital angina. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors cause mild vasodilation and increase the hypotensive effects of nitrates, which leads to potentially serious adverse cardiac effects.

### Cardiovascular risk stratification and cardiovascular risk factors associated with erectile dysfunction: assessing cardiovascular risk in men with erectile dysfunction [^112WXhDw]. Clinical Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular risk factors are known to be associated with the presence of erectile dysfunction (ED), and ED is more common in men with cardiovascular disease (CVD). The Princeton Guidelines provide a strategy for assessing cardiac risk and planning a safe return to sexual activity. Men at low risk, who have fewer than three cardiac risk factors, can resume intercourse with very little concern for an untoward cardiac event. Men at high risk need to have their primary disease controlled, and should be stabilized before planning to resume sexual activity. Prior to resuming intercourse, men in the indeterminate category are candidates for restratification as either low or high risk. Certain cardiovascular risk factors may be predictors of ED: most notably, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes. Advancing age is also a strong predictor of ED. The close correlation between ED and CVD is a signal to evaluate the sexual histories of all men who present for cardiovascular evaluation and, perhaps, of all men in general. Early detection of ED may allow for early diagnosis and management of CVD and diabetes.

Physical training within sexual counseling is addressed by stating that because regular physical exercise is associated with a reduced risk of sexual activity–triggered cardiovascular events, it can be beneficial to include recommendations to exercise regularly as part of sexual counseling (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B). Supporting statements note that exercise training during cardiac rehabilitation has been shown to increase maximum exercise capacity and decrease peak coital heart rate, that regular exercise is associated with a decreased risk of sexual activity–triggered MI, that sedentary lifestyle is a potential modifiable risk factor in men with erectile dysfunction (ED) with empirical studies providing moderate support for the beneficial role of increasing exercise, and that marked improvements in erectile function were shown in a prospective study of exercise and weight loss compared with an educational control in obese men with moderate ED and no overt symptoms of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

### Cardiotoxicity with vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor therapy [^1177LFmy]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Another aspect not clarified at this point is how soon VEGF inhibitor therapy can be resumed or started after an acute coronary syndrome/myocardial infarction. As a general timeline for the healing response, myocytolysis declines after 4 weeks and the risk of hemorrhage declines sharply after 2 weeks at a point in time when angiogenesis reaches a plateau. This corresponds to changes in the VEGF/VEGF-R expression profile. VEGF-A expression increases early after myocardial infarction, thereafter declining. VEGF-B expression, on the other hand, remains significantly suppressed and the expression of VEGF-C and VEGF-D is significantly increased, both early and late after myocardial infarction. VEGF receptor 3 expression is also increased, whereas the expression of VEGF receptors 1 and 2 is decreased. These findings suggest a functional role for VEGF-C and VEGF-D via VEGF receptor 3, which has traditionally been associated with the lymphatic system and may be involved in the repair process. There are no detailed studies looking specifically at this aspect of the VSP. One experimental study evaluating the effect of sorafenib in mice subjected to myocardial infarction did not find evidence of any alteration of post-myocardial infarction neovascularization or fibrosis. However, sorafenib led to apoptosis of cardiac- and bone-derived c-kit+ stem cells, thereby decreasing endogenous cardiac repair capacity. Intriguingly, beta-blocker therapy improved outcomes of sorafenib-treated mice; it ameliorated myocyte loss, improved cardiac function, and reduced mortality. It will be important to test whether these observations can be translated into the clinic and to define the field further. Beta-blocker therapy is standard of care for myocardial infarction patients already and timelines for starting or resuming VSP inhibitor after myocardial infarction may match the perioperative management guidelines, i.e. at least 60 days should pass from the acute myocardial infarction to subsequent stressors.

Patient-Reported Health Status

PROMs are increasingly recognized as providing valuable information about health-related quality of life and are guiding more informed discussions about care management. A review of existing PROMs used in describing cardiovascular disease revealed 3 main instruments, specifically, the Seattle Angina Questionnaire(SAQ-7), Rose Dyspnea Score, Patient Health Questionnaire(PHQ-2), Quality of Life Index(QLI) Cardiac Version IV, and Quality of Life after Myocardial Infarction (QLMI-2/MacNew). These instruments measure cardiac-related symptoms (eg, shortness of breath, chest pain), functional status, and quality of life. The Working Group considered the above measurement tools based on the following qualities: domain coverage (symptom burden, functional status, and quality of life), psychometric properties (validity, sensitivity, and quality of life), feasibility to implement (length of questionnaire, language availability, and cost to implement), and clinical interpretability (knowledge of how to interpret scores in a clinically meaningful way). The SAQ-7, which is short, widely translated into many languages, and has a high degree of clinically interpretability most closely aligned with these qualities and was recommended in the standard set. The Working Group desired additional questions to assess patients' level of dyspnea and depressive symptoms. The PHQ-2, a widely used 2-item questionnaire assessing signs of depression, and 2 items from the Rose Dyspnea Score were included to cover these domains. The Working Group also desired but did not reach a consensus on including time to return to normal activities, return to work, sexual function, or medication side effects within the Standard Set, primarily due to a lack of standardized assessments. The set will evolve over time, and we anticipate these factors may be included in the future.

Sexual health, menopause, and cardiovascular disease

Sexual health concerns are common in patients with all types of CVD. Approximately 60–90% of patients with chronic heart failure report having sexual problems, but fewer than 15% have had a consultation with their physician in matters related to sex and intimacy. For women, the most frequently reported problems are diminished feelings of sexual arousal and enjoyment, leading to difficulties in experiencing orgasm, pain during intercourse, and, with sexual activity being less pleasurable and satisfactory, to decreased desire for sexual activity. Whereas in men CVD coexists with erectile dysfunction, for which endothelial dysfunction is the common underlying pathophysiological mechanism, a definitive pathophysiological link between sexual problems in women and CVD is less clear. However, endothelial dysfunction is unrelated to sexual problems in women with CVD. Sexual problems in women related to low sexual arousal are very common in healthy women. Theoretically, if the heart supplies less blood to the vaginal wall, labia, and clitoris during sexual stimulation, this may lead to reduced capacity to become genitally aroused, resulting in orgasm problems, dyspareunia, and decreased sexual desire. In the first large study investigating the impact of somatic and psychological comorbidities on sexual function in women, CVD was specifically related to lubrication difficulties. Psychological concerns about whether it is safe to be sexually active after a cardiac event may lead to avoidance of physical affection and intimacy. Other symptoms of CVD such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue may interfere with engaging in and enjoyment of sexual activities. Side effects of medication may also disrupt sexual arousal.

In recent years, a limited number of medical treatment options for women with sexual problems have become available. Flibanserin, a serotonin 5-HT-receptor agonist marketed for women with low sexual desire, is associated with considerable risk of syncope and hypotension, and is therefore unsuitable for women with CVD. Bremelanotide, a melanocortin receptor agonist for the treatment of premenopausal women with low sexual desire, was approved in 2019. However, efficacy and safety of the drug in women with CVD are unknown. Although not evidence-based, a recent position statement advises testosterone therapy in post-menopausal women with low sexual desire, supported by measurement of testosterone concentrations in blood to monitor treatment response to prevent overuse. Transdermal testosterone therapy is not associated with increases in BP, blood glucose, or HbA1c levels. However, its safety is not investigated in women at high CVD risk.

Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including CIALIS, should not be used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable as a result of their underlying cardiovascular status. Patients who experience symptoms upon initiation of sexual activity should be advised to refrain from further sexual activity and seek immediate medical attention.

The following groups of patients with cardiovascular disease were not included in clinical safety and efficacy trials for CIALIS, and therefore until further information is available, CIALIS is not recommended for the following groups of patients:

Sexual counseling — environment for sexual activity recommends: It can be beneficial to encourage the use of a comfortable, familiar setting to minimize any cardiac stress associated with sexual activity (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C). Supporting observational data report pathological analysis of deaths that occurred during sexual activity (n = 68), in which almost all deaths occurred in men (92.6%), with the majority occurring during extramarital intercourse (n = 39), and only 19 of the fatal events occurred in the victim's home (n = 16) or the home of a longtime partner (n = 3). The risks, however, appear to be very low; and the increase in risk attributed to coitus was found to be far less than that associated with anger and unaccustomed physical exercise.

### Simultaneous cardiocerebral infarction associated with postcoital activity [^11197Ye3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiocerebral infarction (CCI) is a rare and life-threatening presentation of simultaneous acute myocardial infarction and acute ischemic stroke that requires prompt recognition and proper treatment. CCI is time sensitive and carries a high mortality rate. There is no standardized treatment algorithm that addresses both conditions simultaneously.

Case Report

We present a 29-year-old man with simultaneous myocardial infarction and thrombotic stroke after coital activity. He presented to the Emergency Department with left-sided extremity weakness and numbness and radicular left-sided chest pain. He suffered a cardiac arrest during his evaluation and required emergent percutaneous coronary intervention with stent placement. He was resuscitated successfully and had an uncomplicated clinical course, with improved neurologic recovery prior to discharge. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? CCI is a rare condition that typically occurs in elderly patients with risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Management is challenging due to the time-sensitive nature of diagnosis and treatment of each condition. Treatment is not standardized, unlike individual evidence-based algorithms for thrombotic stroke and acute myocardial infarction. Risks and benefits for each treatment plan should be weighed and therapy should be directed toward the most immediate life-threatening process. This case would add to the literature surrounding this condition and help guide emergency physicians toward the most optimal treatment strategies for this patient population. This case also raises awareness of the existence of this condition and its potential presence in young, otherwise healthy patients.

### Sexual counseling for individuals with cardiovascular disease and their partners: a consensus document from the American Heart Association and the ESC council on cardiovascular nursing and allied professions (CCNAP) [^111649Ks]. Circulation (2013). Medium credibility.

Partner counseling in CVD — needs, stressors, and supportive strategies are described: The focus of education and counseling is often on the person with cardiac disease, and partners may feel their needs are pushed aside; among partners of patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation, sexual concerns were among the most prevalent stressors reported, and distressed spouses reported significantly less intimacy. Couples who believe their sex life is over may need help redefining the relationship, including redefining sexual roles and exploring other sexual behaviors besides intercourse; couples together for many years may need help negotiating new roles, and longstanding sexual problems may now need to be addressed. Both sexes report fear of intercourse or orgasm after a cardiac event, often not communicated to the partner or provider, leading to stress and possible deterioration of the relationship. Men as partners reported challenges to masculine self-image and hesitancy in approaching female partners after MI, while women as partners reported a great sense of loss and uncertainty related to their male partner with MI. The caregiver role affects the intimate relationship and the partner's physical health, and overprotection by family can create conflict, particularly for those who have experienced an MI or had an ICD implanted. It is important to provide interventions for patients and partners in coping and management specific to sexuality and psychological health, and such an intervention may include telephone follow-up with the couple.

Data Analysis

Transcripts were coded by an interdisciplinary team; this was important for establishing the construct validityof the coding scheme. An initial taxonomy was created to establish consistency in coding across interviews and by coders to achieve consensus; this taxonomy is reflected in the domains of the interview guide. All transcripts were individually coded by 6 members of the research team (E.M. A. C.D. B.G. L.G. K.G. and S.T.L.) and exchanged for final reconciliation. Grounded theory, a common theoretical framework used in qualitative data analysis, was employed to systematically analyze the data and, using inductive reasoning, to develop concepts central to informing the design of an intervention. Content analysis, a qualitative research methodology used to analyze and interpret both apparent and latent content, was used to search for patterns and themes that occurred frequently in a single interview or across interviews (units of analyses) and resulted in categorical codes. Text was organized by domain and coded with a theme and keyword identifiers. Themes emerged in response to primary and secondary items and prompts within relevant domains (see Table 1). Themes were iterated until consensus was reached among the coders. In addition to the transcribed interviews, data sources included team meeting notes, e‐mails, and field/phone notes, which were collected, reviewed, and integrated throughout the content analysis period. This documented the taxonomy evolution and construction of the coding schema. The audit trail was periodically reviewed as the team moved to consensus of the final domains and themes. Any conclusions drawn from the qualitative data were reviewed in the context of the entire data set with the goal of finding discrepant information. Conclusions were modified if discrepancies were found. The cardiologists provided additional review of the content analysis and conclusions for face validity and to reduce the possibility of researcher bias or faulty clinical logic. Transcripts and codes were entered into an electronic data analysis program (ATLAS.ti GmbH, Berlin, Germany).

### Sildenafil citrate (sildenafil) [^116FnZpS]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

6.2 Post-marketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of sildenafil (marketed for both PAH and erectile dysfunction). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Cardiovascular Events

In postmarketing experience with sildenafil at doses indicated for erectile dysfunction, serious cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and vascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, ventricular arrhythmia, cerebrovascular hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack, hypertension, pulmonary hemorrhage, and subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhages have been reported in temporal association with the use of the drug. Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of sildenafil without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after use concurrent with sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to sildenafil, to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying cardiovascular disease, or to a combination of these or other factors.

### Erectile dysfunction therapy in special populations and applications: coronary artery disease [^114pUuJC]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) and coronary artery disease (CAD) interact in complex ways: ED is increasingly recognized as a harbinger or risk factor for CAD; a small proportion of cases (about 1%) of acute coronary syndromes (ACS), including acute myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death, occur during or after sexual activity; the absolute risk associated with coitus, including that associated with the use of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors to treat ED, is extremely low; virtually all patients experiencing ACS have previously existing (but usually undiagnosed) CAD; and patients often have ED after ACS as a result of psychological factors or drugs, such as beta-blockers, used to treat CAD. The Princeton Guidelines provide a pragmatic approach to stratifying the risk of ACS in patients with established CAD or at high risk for future ACS. Only a minority of patients destined to experience ACS, including those events related to coitus, have established CAD. Yet, most have ≥ 2 coronary risk factors. The most pragmatic approach to decreasing the risk of ACS in such individuals is to maximize risk factor control and institute combination pharmacotherapy, including statins. The PDE5 inhibitors ameliorate not only ED but also endothelial cell dysfunction. Research to establish the role for PDE5 inhibitors in the prevention and control of ACS is in its early stages. The recognition that ED is a potential harbinger of underlying CAD and future ACS is an important milestone in the management of ED. Progress in integrating PDE5 inhibitors into clinical practice will depend on the success with which patients with ED are evaluated and aggressively treated for endothelial cell dysfunction.

### Sex differences in long-term mortality after myocardial infarction: a systematic review [^1162oNLW]. Circulation (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Studies of sex differences in long-term mortality after acute myocardial infarction have reported mixed results. A systematic review is needed to characterize what is known about sex differences in long-term outcomes and to define gaps in knowledge.

Methods and Results

We searched the Medline database from 1966 to December 2012 to identify all studies that provided sex-based comparisons of mortality after acute myocardial infarction. Only studies with at least 5 years of follow-up were reviewed. Of the 1877 identified abstracts, 52 studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 39 were included in this review. Most studies included fewer than one-third women. There was significant heterogeneity across studies in patient populations, methodology, and risk adjustment, which produced substantial variability in risk estimates. In general, most studies reported higher unadjusted mortality for women compared with men at both 5 and 10 years after acute myocardial infarction; however, many of the differences in mortality became attenuated after adjustment for age. Multivariable models varied between studies; however, most reported a further reduction in sex differences after adjustment for covariates other than age. Few studies examined sex-by-age interactions; however, several studies reported interactions between sex and treatment whereby women have similar mortality risk as men after revascularization.

Conclusions

Sex differences in long-term mortality after acute myocardial infarction are largely explained by differences in age, comorbidities, and treatment use between women and men. Future research should aim to clarify how these differences in risk factors and presentation contribute to the sex gap in mortality.

### Sex and the patient with cardiovascular risk factors: focus on sildenafil [^112BdmrJ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is common in men with cardiovascular disease. The introduction of sildenafil citrate, the first oral agent for the treatment of this disorder, has increased awareness about the risks of sexual activity in cardiac patients and raised concerns about the safety of sildenafil in patients being treated for coronary disease. Sildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), the enzyme responsible for the degradation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Sildenafil acts along the same general pathway as nitric oxide donors to increase cGMP levels and enhance erections. Sildenafil is a modest vasodilator that causes small decreases in systemic arterial pressure and mild preload and afterload reductions. It does not cause major decreases in blood pressure when administered with one or more standard antihypertensive agents. Because PDE5 is also present in small amounts in the systemic vasculature, sildenafil can cause a synergistic and major decrease in pressure when combined with organic nitrates. Use of organic nitrates is the only contraindication to sildenafil use. Data on sildenafil in patients with recent (less than 6 months) myocardial infarction (MI), unstable angina, stroke, and recent life-threatening arrhythmias are not available, so the drug should be used with caution in patients with unstable cardiac conditions. Placebo-controlled and open-label phase 2/3 trials including men with ischemic heart disease did not show an increase in MI or serious cardiovascular events in patients treated with sildenafil versus placebo. None of the serious cardiovascular events reported in these trials were considered treatment related by the investigators. There is a small but finite increased risk of developing ischemia or infarction with sexual activity. Therefore, before prescribing sildenafil or any current or future treatment for ED to patients with known cardiac disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors, physicians should discuss the potential cardiac risk of sexual activity and perform a complete medical assessment, including an exercise stress test if appropriate.

### Sexual function in patients with chronic angina pectoris [^114HsFHM]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Drugs for erectile dysfunction (ED) may be contraindicated with nitrates commonly used to treat patients with angina pectoris, and certain antianginal therapies may worsen ED. The American Heart Association and the Princeton Consensus Conference panel of experts recommend that patients with coronary artery disease and ED who experience angina pectoris undergo full medical evaluations to assess the cardiovascular risks associated with resuming sexual activity before being prescribed therapy for ED. Current antianginal therapies include β blockers, calcium channel blockers, short- and long-acting nitrates, and ranolazine, a late sodium current inhibitor. Short- and long-acting nitrates remain a contraindication with phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors commonly used to treat patients with ED, and the benefits of the other antianginal therapies must be weighed against their effects on cardiovascular health and erectile function. In conclusion, patients with coronary artery disease and ED who wish to initiate phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor therapy and need to discontinue nitrate therapy need treatment options that manage their angina pectoris effectively, maintain their cardiovascular health, and provide the freedom to maintain their sexual function.

Methods

Study population

ELSA is a longitudinal panel study of men and women aged 50 or more living in England that started in 2002. The sample is assessed on a two yearly basis, and these data were collected in wave 6 (2012/2013). The sample is periodically refreshed to ensure the full age range is maintained, and comparisons of sociodemographic characteristics with the national census show that the sample is representative of the English population. The general methods of data collection are detailed at. The Sexual Relationships and Activities Questionnaire (SRA-Q) was administered as a self-completion measure and was returned by 7079 (67%) participants. We excluded individuals who failed to state whether or not they had been sexually active over the last year, and respondents who did not have CHD but had a history of stroke or heart failure, since these conditions may have a shared aetiology with CHD. The study sample therefore consisted of 6690 respondents, 2979 men and 3711 women. The study was approved by the National Research Ethics Service, and all participants provided informed signed consent.

Definition of CHD

The presence of CHD was defined as a doctor diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) or angina pectoris. Participants provided this information at biennial waves of data collection, so the CHD cases were subsequently divided into those who had been diagnosed within the past 4 years or ≥ 4 years ago.

Sexual activity, sexual behaviour and sexual concerns

The SRA-Q has been described in detail elsewhere. The questionnaire was derived from previously validated measures with modifications to ensure comparability with the National Social Life, Health and Aging Study in the United Statesand with the National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles in the UK. It covers a wide range of information on attitudes to sex; frequency of sexual activities and behaviours; problems with sexual activities and function; concerns and worries about sexual activities and sexual function; and satisfaction with sex. The male and female versions of the SRA-Q are available online at. Participants completed the questionnaire in private and returned it in a sealed envelope. Details of the items presented in this report are provided in the online supplementary material.

### Sexual counseling for individuals with cardiovascular disease and their partners: a consensus document from the American Heart Association and the ESC council on cardiovascular nursing and allied professions (CCNAP) [^113jcwj2]. Circulation (2013). Medium credibility.

Sexual counseling in cardiovascular disease — scope and delivery emphasize patient and partner inclusion, defined content, and formats for care. The text states that "the inclusion of partners in sexual counseling is important". It defines sexual counseling as "an interaction with patients that includes information on sexual concerns and safe return to sexual activity, as well as assessment, support, and specific advice related to psychological and sexual problems, also referred to as psychosexual counseling". Counseling is described as occurring "during a one-to-one exchange with a trained person, with the aim of solving a problem and offering advice", and it "offers a psychophysiological approach with the possible integration of pharmacotherapy, which is different from other types of therapy". Delivery can be "short-term, as might occur in the acute care setting, or ongoing counseling in the office setting during repeated patient visits". The document affirms that "Patients with both acute and chronic cardiovascular problems can benefit from sexual counseling", that "Current research clearly articulates the need for healthcare professionals to become more actively involved in sexual counseling", and that clinicians "recognize the importance of discussing sexual function and activity and also express their responsibility to do so, although many healthcare professionals do not know what specific advice to give".
