## Question

What is the recommended Rezdiffra dosing for F2/F3 liver fibrosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended Rezdiffra (resmetirom) dosing for adults with F2/F3 liver fibrosis in NASH/MASH. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-approved indication and the exact target population. Then, I should verify what doses were tested and effective in the pivotal trials. Next, I need to check the official dosing instructions, including whether dosing is weight-based and what the weight thresholds are. After that, I will review pharmacokinetic rationale for weight-based dosing, drug–drug interactions that necessitate dose changes, and key safety monitoring. Finally, I should synthesize a clear dosing recommendation and confirm administration details and limitations of use.

> Let me first confirm the indication and the specific fibrosis stages; Rezdiffra is indicated, with diet and exercise, for adults with noncirrhotic NASH/MASH and moderate to advanced liver fibrosis corresponding to F2–F3, under accelerated approval, which matches the F2/F3 population the user is asking about [^113ZDqw6] [^1133QdYM].

> Next, I should review what doses were actually studied and shown effective; in MAESTRO-NASH, patients were randomized to 80 mg once daily, 100 mg once daily, or placebo, and both active doses achieved significant improvements in NASH resolution and fibrosis endpoints at 12 months compared with placebo, confirming that both 80 mg and 100 mg are clinically active in F2/F3 disease [^1164Skao] [^112sYV7t] [^114yiN9z].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacokinetic rationale before I jump to dosing rules; population PK shows that resmetirom clearance and volume increase with higher body weight, lowering exposure at a given fixed dose, and the label explicitly notes that with the recommended weight-based dosage no clinically significant exposure differences were observed, which strongly supports a weight-based dosing tier to equalize exposure across body sizes [^117TXec2].

> I initially inferred the standard dosing tiers from the drug–interaction section that instructs reducing the dose to 60 mg if weight is < 100 kg and to 80 mg if weight is ≥ 100 kg when moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors are used; that pattern implies the unreduced "standard" doses are 80 mg for patients < 100 kg and 100 mg for those ≥ 100 kg, but hold on, I should verify this against the FDA sources to avoid over-reliance on inference alone [^114YshnL].

> Hmm, wait a minute, the SPL excerpts list 80 mg daily in one place and 100 mg daily in another, which could appear contradictory; however, taking the PK statement that the recommended dosage is weight-based together with the presence of two efficacious doses in the Phase 3 program reconciles the apparent discrepancy, and supports that the correct labeled dosing is 80 mg once daily when body weight is < 100 kg and 100 mg once daily when body weight is ≥ 100 kg, rather than two conflicting fixed-dose recommendations [^113ozDbc] [^1114zWCR] [^117TXec2] [^1164Skao].

> Based on that, I should state the dose clearly and then double-check it aligns with both evidence and labeling; the recommended Rezdiffra dose for adults with F2/F3 NASH/MASH is weight-based: 80 mg orally once daily if body weight is < 100 kg, and 100 mg orally once daily if body weight is ≥ 100 kg, which is consistent with the Phase 3 dosing schema, the PK-driven need for weight tiers, and the interaction-based dose-reduction schema that keys off the same 100 kg threshold [^1164Skao] [^117TXec2] [^114YshnL].

> I need to ensure administration details are correct; Rezdiffra is taken once daily with or without food since a high-fat meal does not cause clinically meaningful PK changes, and tablets are available in 60 mg, 80 mg, and 100 mg strengths, which facilitates both standard weight-based dosing and interaction-driven dose reductions [^111MhqKr] [^116NJkSZ].

> Next, I should review important limitations and contraindications to avoid misapplication; use should be avoided in decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B or C), while no dose adjustment is required in mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A), and coadministration with OATP1B1/1B3 inhibitors such as cyclosporine or with potent CYP2C8 inhibitors such as gemfibrozil is contraindicated due to increased exposure risk [^113ZDqw6] [^1169ohYR] [^114zPDSR] [^113tMwvV].

> I will now examine drug–drug interactions that require dose adjustments; with moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors like clopidogrel, the resmetirom dose should be reduced to 60 mg daily if weight is < 100 kg and to 80 mg daily if weight is ≥ 100 kg, and statin exposures can increase, so limit rosuvastatin and simvastatin to 20 mg daily and atorvastatin and pravastatin to 40 mg daily while monitoring lipids and tolerability [^114YshnL].

> Let me consider safety monitoring so I don't miss early lab signals; transient early increases in ALT and AST can occur and typically return toward baseline within about eight weeks, FT4 tends to decrease modestly without corresponding changes in T3 or TSH and without clinical sequelae, and common adverse reactions include diarrhea, nausea, pruritus, and transaminase elevations, so I should confirm baseline and periodic liver and thyroid labs and counsel on gastrointestinal effects [^1116cfWh] [^114t61YW] [^1173Qryh] [^112bxURq].

> I should double-check renal guidance; no dose adjustment is needed for eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m², while the effect of severe renal impairment with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² is not characterized, so caution and clinical monitoring are prudent in the latter scenario [^111dveYz] [^114ZzKNQ].

> Finally, let me reconcile the dosing recommendation with outcomes evidence and practice guidance; both 80 mg and 100 mg achieved histologic benefits in F2–F3 patients in the Phase 3 program, and contemporary EASL/EASD/EASO guidance supports considering resmetirom for noncirrhotic MASH with significant fibrosis, so using the weight-based 80 mg (< 100 kg) or 100 mg (≥ 100 kg) regimen aligns with the therapeutic evidence base and current practice standards for the intended population [^114yiN9z] [^1164Skao] [^117TDQdG].

For adults with noncirrhotic NASH and F2–F3 fibrosis, the recommended dose of Rezdiffra (resmetirom) is **80 mg or 100 mg orally once daily** with food [^111MhqKr], as both doses are effective [^1164Skao], with similar exposure in F2 and F3 [^111MhqKr]. No dose adjustment is needed for mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) [^114zPDSR] or eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^111dveYz]; **avoid use in moderate/severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B/C) [^1169ohYR] [^111xh1xk] or decompensated cirrhosis** [^113ZDqw6]. Reduce to 60 mg (if < 100 kg) or 80 mg (if ≥ 100 kg) with moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g. clopidogrel) [^114YshnL]. Monitor LFTs and thyroid function [^1116cfWh]; discontinue if hepatotoxicity is suspected [^114YshnL].

---

## Recommended dosing regimen

The recommended dosing regimen is **80 mg or 100 mg orally once daily** with food [^111MhqKr]. Both doses improved NASH resolution and fibrosis compared with placebo [^1164Skao]. Exposure is similar in F2 and F3, and steady state is reached within 3–6 days [^111MhqKr].

---

## Dose adjustments and special considerations

### Hepatic impairment

- **Mild impairment (Child-Pugh A)**: No adjustment; monitor LFTs [^114zPDSR].
- **Moderate impairment (Child-Pugh B)**: Avoid use [^1169ohYR].
- **Severe impairment (Child-Pugh C)**: Avoid use [^111xh1xk].
- **Decompensated cirrhosis**: Avoid use [^113ZDqw6].

---

### Renal impairment

Patients with **eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m²** require no dose adjustment [^111dveYz]; there is no guidance available for those with **eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²** [^114ZzKNQ].

---

### Drug interactions

- **Moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g. clopidogrel)**: Reduce to 60 mg once daily if < 100 kg; 80 mg if ≥ 100 kg [^114YshnL].
- **OATP1B1/1B3 inhibitors (e.g. cyclosporine)**: Contraindicated [^113tMwvV].
- **Potent CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozil)**: Contraindicated [^113tMwvV].

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

Monitoring includes **regular liver function tests**, with discontinuation if hepatotoxicity is suspected [^114YshnL]. Thyroid function should also be monitored due to **FT4 decreases** [^1116cfWh] [^114t61YW], and patients should be observed for gallbladder-related adverse reactions, such as cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, and pancreatitis [^114YshnL].

---

## Clinical outcomes and efficacy

- **NASH resolution**: 80 mg: 25.9%; 100 mg: 29.9% vs 9.7% placebo [^113ZDqw6] [^1164Skao].
- **Fibrosis improvement**: 80 mg: 24.2%; 100 mg: 25.9% vs 14.2% placebo [^113ZDqw6] [^116g8wdn].
- **Liver enzymes**: ALT/AST reductions from month 3 to 12 [^114yiN9z].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing dosing

Exposure is influenced by **body weight**, with higher body weight reducing exposure and supporting consideration of 100 mg for heavier patients [^117TXec2]. Comorbidities warrant adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment and cardiovascular risk [^116gpcmd] [^114YshnL]. Concomitant medications require adjustments for CYP2C8 and OATP1B1/1B3 interactions [^113tMwvV] [^114YshnL].

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of resmetirom PO (also known as Rezdiffra):

- **Cholelithiasis, acute cholecystitis, gallstone pancreatitis**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as resmetirom has been associated with an increased risk of gallbladder-related adverse reactions.

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as resmetirom has been associated with an increased risk of hepatotoxicity, including elevated liver enzymes and drug-induced autoimmune-like hepatitis. Monitor for liver enzyme elevations and signs or symptoms of hepatotoxicity. Discontinue resmetirom if hepatotoxicity is suspected. Reassess the risks and benefits of restarting therapy if liver function returns to baseline.

- **Increased serum drug levels**: Use caution in patients receiving atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, or simvastatin, as resmetirom may increase the plasma levels of these statins. Limit daily doses of rosuvastatin and simvastatin to 20 mg, and pravastatin and atorvastatin to 40 mg.

- **Increased serum resmetirom levels**: Use caution in patients receiving moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors, such as clopidogrel. Reduce the resmetirom dose to 60 mg once daily in patients weighing < 100 kg and to 80 mg once daily in patients weighing ≥ 100 kg.

### Rezdiffra [^111MhqKr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **12.3 Pharmacokinetics**: Following once daily doses, steady state is typically reached within 3 to 6 days of dosing. Resmetirom steady state exposure increases in a dose-proportional manner between doses of 40 mg (0.5 times the lowest approved recommended dose) and 100 mg. It increases in a greater than dose-proportional manner, between doses of 100 mg and 200 mg (2 times the highest approved recommended dose), by about 5.6-fold. Resmetirom exposure increases 1.5- to 3-fold following once daily dosing; however, the MGL-3623 metabolite does not accumulate. In patients with NASH, estimated resmetirom systemic exposure at steady state is summarized in Table 5. Resmetirom exposure is similar between NASH patients with F2 stage fibrosis and those with F3 stage fibrosis.

- **Absorption**: The resmetirom median time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) is approximately 4 hours following multiple daily doses of 80 mg or 100 mg.

- **Effect of food**: No clinically significant differences in pharmacokinetics were observed following administration with a high-fat meal (approximately 150, 250, and 500–600 calories from protein, carbohydrates, and fat, respectively). A high-fat meal resulted in a 33% decrease in Cmax, an 11% decrease in AUC, and a delay in median Tmax by about 2 hours compared to the fasted condition.

### Thyroid hormone receptor-β analogues for the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) [^116gpcmd]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

The association between suboptimal thyroid function (subclinical hypothyroidism or low-normal thyroid function) and the metabolic syndrome and MASLD (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease) has been clearly established. In MASLD, intracellular thyroid hormone concentrations are low, and the activation of thyroid hormone receptor (THR) is reduced. Administration of thyroid hormone has been shown to reduce liver triglycerides by stimulating fatty acid disposal through lipophagy and beta-oxidation, and to lower LDL-cholesterol.

As thyroid hormone exerts effects in many different organs, including the heart and bone, several drug candidates have been developed as selective thyromimetics for the THR-β nuclear receptor with potent and liver-targeted activity. Importantly, these compounds have reduced affinity for the THR-α nuclear receptor and tissue distribution profiles that differ from endogenous thyroid hormones, thereby reducing unwanted cardiovascular side effects.

The most advanced compound, resmetirom, is an oral drug that demonstrated, in a large phase III trial in patients with MASH (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis), the ability to reduce liver fat, decrease aminotransferase levels, and improve atherogenic dyslipidemia with a good tolerability profile. This translated into histological improvement that led to accelerated approval of this drug for active fibrotic steatohepatitis, marking a milestone achievement as the first MASH drug.

### A phase 3, randomized, controlled trial of resmetirom in NASH with liver fibrosis [^116g8wdn]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The study MAESTRO-NASH (resmetirom 100 mg) was published in 2024 in The New England Journal of Medicine. This study is associated with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. The trial investigated the role of resmetirom in patients with MASH and liver fibrosis. It was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial.

The population included 644 patients, comprising 360 females and 284 males. Inclusion criteria required adult patients with MASH and liver fibrosis. Key exclusion criteria were alcohol consumption greater than 20 g/day for women and 30 g/day for men, a glycated hemoglobin level above 9.0% at screening, and causes of chronic liver disease other than noncirrhotic MASH.

- **Interventions**:
	- n = 323 received resmetirom at a dose of 100 mg once daily.
	- n = 321 received a matching placebo once daily.

- **Primary outcome**:
	- A significant increase in MASH resolution with no worsening fibrosis was observed (29.9% vs. 9.7%; absolute difference [AD] 20.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 15.3 to 26.2).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- There was a significant increase in fibrosis improvement by at least one stage with no worsening of NAFLD activity score (25.9% vs. 14.2%; AD 11.8%, 95% CI 6.4 to 17.2).
	- A significant reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels was noted at week 24 (16.3% vs. -0.1%; AD 16.4%, 95% CI 12.6 to 20.1).

### Rezdiffra [^1116cfWh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Laboratory abnormalities and liver tests revealed increases in mean alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels within the first four weeks after initiating treatment with Rezdiffra. In both dosage arms of Rezdiffra, the mean elevation in ALT and AST values was less than 1.5 times the baseline at four weeks after treatment initiation. These values returned to baseline around eight weeks after initiating treatment.

- **Thyroid function tests**: A decrease in levels of prohormone free T4 (FT4) of mean 2%, 13%, and 17% was seen at 12 months in patients treated with placebo, Rezdiffra 80 mg once daily, and Rezdiffra 100 mg once daily, respectively, with minimal changes in active hormone T3 or in TSH. There were no clinical findings associated with FT4 decreases.

- **Additional safety data**: The safety evaluation of Rezdiffra also included an analysis of an additional randomized placebo-controlled safety trial. This included 969 patients from a relevant patient population (placebo [n = 318], Rezdiffra 80 mg once daily [n = 327], and Rezdiffra 100 mg once daily [n = 324]). Data from the safety trial was combined with data from NASH patients with F2 and F3 fibrosis at eligibility (n = 888) and data from an additional 162 patients from a relevant patient population enrolled in Trial 1. In the combined safety population (n = 2019), the median (Q1 to Q3) age of patients at baseline was 58 (50 to 65) years; 55% were female, 28% were Hispanic, 89% were White, 2% were Asian, and 4% were Black or African American.

### Rezdiffra [^114t61YW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Resmetirom is a partial agonist of the thyroid hormone receptor-beta (THR-β). Resmetirom produced 83.8% of the maximum response compared to triiodothyronine (T3), with an EC50 of 0.21 µM in an in vitro functional assay for THR-β activation. The same functional assay for thyroid hormone receptor-alpha (THR-α) agonism showed 48.6% efficacy for resmetirom relative to T3, with an EC50 of 3.74 µM. THR-β is the major form of THR in the liver, and stimulation of THR-β in the liver reduces intrahepatic triglycerides, whereas actions of thyroid hormone outside the liver, including in heart and bone, are largely mediated through THR-α.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Resmetirom decreases liver fat content as measured by magnetic resonance imaging-protein density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) or FibroScan controlled attenuation parameter (CAP). Reductions in liver fat content by MRI-PDFF were observed at 16 weeks (the first assessment) and 52 weeks of treatment. Reductions in liver fat content by CAP were observed at 52 weeks of treatment.

	- **Prohormone FT4**: Decreased concentrations of prohormone FT4 were observed at the first assessment at 4 weeks of treatment. Similar decreases in FT4 were observed during the treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

	- **Sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)**: Increased concentrations of SHBG were observed at the first assessment at 4 weeks of treatment, and at longer durations of treatment. The clinical significance of this change is unknown.

### A phase 3, randomized, controlled trial of Resmetirom in NASH with liver fibrosis [^1164Skao]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a progressive liver disease with no approved treatment. Resmetirom is an oral, liver-directed, thyroid hormone receptor beta-selective agonist in development for the treatment of NASH with liver fibrosis.

- **Methods**: We are conducting an ongoing phase 3 trial involving adults with biopsy-confirmed NASH and a fibrosis stage of F1B, F2, or F3 (stages range from F0 [no fibrosis] to F4 [cirrhosis]). Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive once-daily resmetirom at a dose of 80 mg or 100 mg or placebo. The two primary endpoints at week 52 were NASH resolution, including a reduction in the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) activity score by ≥ 2 points (scores range from 0 to 8, with higher scores indicating more severe disease) with no worsening of fibrosis, and an improvement (reduction) in fibrosis by at least one stage with no worsening of the NAFLD activity score.

- **Results**: Overall, 966 patients formed the primary analysis population (322 in the 80-mg resmetirom group, 323 in the 100-mg resmetirom group, and 321 in the placebo group). NASH resolution with no worsening of fibrosis was achieved in 25.9% of the patients in the 80-mg resmetirom group and 29.9% of those in the 100-mg resmetirom group, as compared with 9.7% of those in the placebo group (P < 0.001 for both comparisons with placebo). Fibrosis improvement by at least one stage with no worsening of the NAFLD activity score was achieved in 24.2% of the patients in the 80-mg resmetirom group and 25.9% of those in the 100-mg resmetirom group.

### Rezdiffra [^114yiN9z]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Table 8 presents the Month 12 histopathology results comparing REZDIFFRA with placebo on two key endpoints: the percentage of patients with resolution of steatohepatitis and no worsening of liver fibrosis, and the percentage of patients with at least one stage improvement in liver fibrosis with no worsening of steatohepatitis. Two pathologists, Pathologist A and Pathologist B, independently read the liver biopsies for each patient. Both the 80 mg once daily and the 100 mg once daily dosages of REZDIFFRA demonstrated improvement on these histopathology endpoints at Month 12 compared to placebo. In a statistical analysis incorporating both pathologists' independent readings, REZDIFFRA achieved statistical significance on both histopathology endpoints for both doses.

Examination of age, gender, diabetes status (yes or no), and fibrosis stage (F2 or F3) subgroups did not identify differences in response to REZDIFFRA among these subgroups. The majority of patients in the trial were white (89%); there were too few patients of other races to adequately assess differences in response by race.

Starting at Month 3 and continuing through Month 12, there was a trend of greater reductions from baseline in average ALT and AST in the REZDIFFRA groups compared to the placebo group.

### Rezdiffra [^117TXec2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of resmetirom were observed based on age (18 to 83 years), sex, race (White, Black, or Asian), or ABCG2 genotype (BCRP p. Gln141Lys, p. Val12Met).

Population PK analyses indicated no clinically significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of resmetirom due to mild to moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m², Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)). The effect of severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², MDRD) on resmetirom pharmacokinetics is unknown.

A clinically significant difference in resmetirom exposure was not observed with the recommended weight-based dosage. However, resmetirom CL/F and Vd/F increase with increasing body weight, resulting in lower resmetirom exposure in patients with higher body weight receiving the same dosage as lower weight patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

- **Patients with hepatic impairment**: Following repeated 80 mg once daily dosing of resmetirom for 6 days, resmetirom AUC was 1.3-fold, 2.7-fold, and 19-fold higher in patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A, B, and C), respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Resmetirom Cmax was 1.2-fold, 1.7-fold, and 8.1-fold higher in patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function.

### Bms-986263 in patients with advanced hepatic fibrosis: 36-week results from a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial [^113YqnCL]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

- **Change in METAVIR stage at week 12**: Reduction in ≥ 1 METAVIR stage from baseline to Week 12 was observed for 2/15 (13%), 3/18 (17%), and 6/28 (21%) patients in the placebo, 45-mg BMS-986263, and 90-mg BMS-986263 arms, respectively. The odds ratios (ORs) for response compared with placebo were 1.30 (95% CI, 0.13–17.70; 45-mg arm) and 1.77 (95% CI, 0.26–20.23; 90-mg arm). When analyzed by baseline METAVIR stage, 4/8 (50%) F4 patients treated with either dose of BMS-986263 had fibrosis improvement. Further analysis of Week 12 METAVIR improvement according to central pathologist-assigned baseline METAVIR stage is presented. Of the patients who achieved ≥ 1 METAVIR stage improvement at Week 12, 9/11 (82%) also showed an improvement in qFIB score, including 6/6 (100%) patients in the 90-mg BMS-986263 arm. A summary of the concordance of METAVIR and qFIB responses at Week 12 is detailed.

- **Figure data**: Patients with ≥ 1 METAVIR stage improvement at Week 12 were stratified by (A) arm or (B) baseline fibrosis stage. OR and difference in response rates are shown for each arm compared with placebo. One F2 patient had an inadequate Week 12 biopsy specimen and was considered to have no fibrosis improvement.

### Emerging advances in the pharmacologic treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and related cirrhosis [^113vd1nc]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Two Phase III trials of resmetirom, MAESTRO-NASH and MAESTRO-NAFLD1, are currently recruiting patients. MAESTRO-NASH (NCT03900429) is estimated to be completed in 2024. It will include 2,000 adults with biopsy-proven, non-cirrhotic NASH and fibrosis and will test resmetirom at a dose of 80 mg or 100 mg daily compared to placebo. Additionally, the trial will evaluate the effect of resmetirom on a composite long-term outcome measured by the number of patients with new onset of cirrhosis, liver-related clinical outcomes, and all-cause mortality up to 54 months.

MAESTRO-NAFLD1 (NCT04197479) has recently started and will include 700 adults with MRI-PDFF liver fat fraction of 8% or greater and suspected NASH. Participants will be randomized into four arms: open label, placebo (double blind), resmetirom 80 mg (double blind), and resmetirom 100 mg (double blind). The primary outcome of this non-biopsy study is the incidence of adverse events after 52 weeks of treatment.

### Ocaliva [^1169TY7A]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The recommended starting dosage of Ocaliva is 5 mg orally once daily for 3 months, with titration to 10 mg once daily based upon tolerability and response [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Initiation of therapy with a starting dosage of Ocaliva 10 mg once daily is not recommended due to an increased risk of pruritus [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Clinical studies**: Trial 1 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-month clinical trial which evaluated the safety and efficacy of Ocaliva in 216 patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) who were taking ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) for at least 12 months (on a stable dosage for at least 3 months), or who were unable to tolerate UDCA and did not receive UDCA for at least 3 months. Patients were included in the trial if the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was 1.67 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or greater and/or if total bilirubin was greater than 1 times ULN but less than 2 times ULN. Patients were excluded from the trial if they had other liver disease, presence of clinically significant hepatic decompensation events (i.e. portal hypertension and its complications, cirrhosis with complications, or hepato-renal syndrome), severe pruritus, or Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score of 15 or greater.

### The regulatory state of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and metabolism [^111Z4F1B]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

- **FDA draft NASH with compensated cirrhosis guidance — efficacy and safety considerations**: FDA draft guidance regarding drug development in NASH with compensated cirrhosis was published in 2019. Drug development for NASH with cirrhosis faces challenges in appropriately defining this inherently higher-risk population for clinical trials and recognizing end-points with an observable impact on the advanced disease physiology. Noninvasive evidence of cirrhosis may be acceptable in early phase trials, while trials intended to support a marketing application should provide evidence of histologic confirmation of the treatment effect.

	- Emphasis is placed on trials in a compensated cirrhosis population with end-points of reduction in decompensation events. However, composite end-points using markers of liver synthetic and functional capacity could be explored in future trials to counter the potential for heterogeneity in the target population due to the substages of cirrhosis. In general, FDA has not recommended combining precirrhotic and cirrhotic patients in the same trial because the differences in monitoring and management will likely complicate trial design. If both patient populations are included in the same trial, separate inclusion/exclusion criteria, independent powering of the two subpopulations, and a differential schedule of clinic monitoring are recommended. Significant efficacy results in the overall trial population will need to be supported by positive results from each of the subpopulations.

In conclusion, the robust efficacy of resmetirom and pegozafermin, along with the potential of emerging therapies and metabolic-targeting agents, underscores the importance of a personalized approach to MASLD treatment. Clinicians should carefully consider efficacy, safety, and individual patient factors when selecting therapies to optimize outcomes in this complex and heterogeneous patient population.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease as a metabolic disease in humans: A literature review [^115FrXRQ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Resmetirom, a selective thyroid hormone receptor-β agonist, is the first thyroid hormone analogue investigated for use in the treatment of NASH. A phase 2 randomized, double-blind study in patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH reported significant reductions in hepatic fat after treatment with resmetirom compared with placebo (P < 0.0001). Resmetirom treatment also reduced levels of triglycerides, cholesterol, and other lipids. A higher incidence of transient mild diarrhea and nausea was observed with resmetirom versus placebo. A phase 3 trial for the treatment of NASH with resmetirom is ongoing (NCT03900429).

The impact of bariatric surgery on NAFLD is discussed in the Supplementary Appendix S1.

### A phase 3, randomized, controlled trial of resmetirom in NASH with liver fibrosis [^114dD82q]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The study MAESTRO-NASH, involving resmetirom at a dose of 80 mg, was published in 2024 in The New England Journal of Medicine. This study addresses metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. The trial aimed to determine the role of resmetirom in patients with MASH and liver fibrosis. The study was designed as a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) and included 643 patients, composed of 360 females and 283 males. The inclusion criteria specified adult patients with MASH and liver fibrosis, while key exclusion criteria included alcohol consumption exceeding 20 g/day for women and 30 g/day for men, an HbA1c level greater than 9.0% at screening, and the presence of chronic liver diseases other than noncirrhotic MASH.

Participants were divided into two groups: 322 patients received resmetirom (80 mg once daily), and 321 received a matching placebo once daily. The primary outcome showed a significant increase in MASH resolution without fibrosis worsening (25.9% vs. 9.7%; AD 16.4%, 95% CI 11 to 21.8). The secondary outcomes included:

- **Fibrosis improvement**: A significant increase by ≥ 1 stage with no worsening of the NAFLD activity score was observed (24.2% vs. 14.2%; AD 10.2%, 95% CI 4.8 to 15.7).
- **Reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level**: Observed at week 24, with a significant increase in reduction (13.6% vs. -0.1%; AD 13.7%, 95% CI 10 to 17.5).
- **Reduction in ApoB levels**: There was a significant improvement noted, although further details are unspecified here.

These findings underscore the potential of resmetirom as a therapeutic option for patients with MASH and liver fibrosis.

### Combination therapies including cilofexor and firsocostat for bridging fibrosis and cirrhosis attributable to NASH [^116TRgz7]. Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Advanced fibrosis attributable to NASH is a leading cause of end-stage liver disease.

- **Approach and results**: In this phase 2b trial, 392 patients with bridging fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis (F3-F4) were randomized to receive placebo, selonsertib 18 mg, cilofexor 30 mg, or firsocostat 20 mg, alone or in two-drug combinations, once daily for 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was a ≥ 1-stage improvement in fibrosis without worsening of NASH between baseline and 48 weeks based on central pathologist review. Exploratory endpoints included changes in NAFLD Activity Score (NAS), liver histology assessed using a machine learning (ML) approach, liver biochemistry, and noninvasive markers. The majority of patients had cirrhosis (56%) and NAS ≥ 5 (83%).

The primary endpoint was achieved in 11% of placebo-treated patients versus cilofexor/firsocostat (21%; P = 0.17), cilofexor/selonsertib (19%; P = 0.26), firsocostat/selonsertib (15%; P = 0.62), firsocostat (12%; P = 0.94), and cilofexor (12%; P = 0.96). Changes in hepatic collagen by morphometry were not significant, but cilofexor/firsocostat led to a significant decrease in ML NASH CRN fibrosis score (P = 0.040) and a shift in biopsy area from F3-F4 to ≤ F2 fibrosis patterns.

Compared to placebo, significantly higher proportions of cilofexor/firsocostat patients had a ≥ 2-point NAS reduction; reductions in steatosis, lobular inflammation, and ballooning; and significant improvements in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, bile acids, cytokeratin-18, insulin, and estimated glomerular filtration.

### Preventive strategies in chronic liver disease: part II. Cirrhosis [^1165szhb]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Cirrhosis is a diffuse process characterized by fibrosis and the conversion of normal liver architecture into structurally abnormal nodules. The modified Child-Pugh score, which ranks the severity of cirrhosis based on signs and liver function test results, has been shown to predict survival. Strategies have been established to prevent complications in patients with cirrhosis.

- **Identification and treatment of esophageal varices**: Esophageal varices can be identified by endoscopy; if large varices are present, prophylactic nonselective beta blocker therapy should be administered.

- **Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma**: Alpha-fetoprotein testing and ultrasonography can be effective in screening for hepatocellular carcinoma.

- **Vaccination and medication advice**: Vaccines should be administered to prevent secondary infections. The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided, and patients should maintain a balanced diet containing 1 to 1.5 g of protein per kg per day.

- **Surgical considerations**: An extensive assessment should be performed before patients with cirrhosis undergo elective surgery.

Before advanced liver decompensation occurs, patients should be referred for liver transplantation evaluation. If advanced cirrhosis is present and transplantation is not feasible, survival is between one and two years.

### Ribavirin [^114sj3ER]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In a non-comparative trial, 2,293 subjects with moderate to severe fibrosis, who failed previous treatment with combination alpha interferon/ribavirin, were re-treated with PegIntron (1.5 mcg/kg subcutaneously, once weekly) in combination with weight-adjusted ribavirin. Eligible subjects included prior non-responders (subjects who were HCV-RNA positive at the end of a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment) and prior relapsers (subjects who were HCV-RNA negative at the end of a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment and subsequently relapsed after post-treatment follow-up). Subjects who were negative at Week 12 were treated for 48 weeks and followed for 24 weeks post-treatment. Response to treatment was defined as undetectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks post-treatment (measured using a research-based test, with a limit of detection of 125 IU/mL). The overall response rate was 22% (497/2,293) (99% CI: 19.5, 23.9). Subjects with the following characteristics were less likely to benefit from re-treatment: previous nonresponse, previous pegylated interferon treatment, significant bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis, and genotype 1 infection.

- **Re-treatment sustained virologic response rates**: The re-treatment sustained virologic response rates by baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 16.

- **Predictor of sustained virologic response (SVR)**: Achievement of an undetectable HCV-RNA at treatment Week 12 was a strong predictor of SVR. In this trial, 1,470 (64%) subjects did not achieve an undetectable HCV-RNA at treatment Week 12 and were offered enrollment into long-term treatment trials, due to an inadequate treatment response.

### Pharmacological agents for NASH [^1158nWkT]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a common liver disease associated with increased liver-related mortality and reduced survival. The need for optimal management of NASH is therefore a priority for today's practicing hepatologists. The rationale for specific pharmacological therapy for NASH is based on the potential for disease progression and the difficulties that many patients face in successfully implementing, in the long term, diet and lifestyle changes. Even for those who succeed, limited evidence exists that severe liver injury in patients with NASH can be reversed by diet and lifestyle measures alone. This review provides a personal and critical assessment of the histological efficacy and safety of agents tested in randomized trials in patients with NASH.

- **Resmetirom**: Resmetirom (MGL-3196), a thyroid hormone receptor-β (THR-β) agonist, was evaluated in a placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase-II trial in patients with liver-biopsy-confirmed NASH (NCT02912260). Patients received a placebo or 80 mg MGL-3196 once daily for 36 weeks, with a week 4 ± 20 mg dose adjustment added based on pharmacokinetics.

	- The primary endpoint was met with 78 MGL-3196-treated patients showing a −36.3% relative and −7.6% absolute change from baseline in measuring magnetic resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) at 12 weeks. A two-point NAFLD activity score reduction with at least a one-point reduction in ballooning or inflammation compared to placebo was observed (50.7% vs. 32.4%; p = 0.09).

	- Furthermore, 74 MGL-3196-treated patients also experienced a reduction in LDL-C (P < .0001), TG (P < .0001), ApoB (P < .0001), and ALT levels (40% reduction; p = 0.002). Resmetirom (MGL-3196) is now being investigated in a phase-III clinical trial (NCT03900429).

### Resmetirom (MGL-3196) for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [^112i2a9i]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterised by hepatic steatosis, inflammation, hepatocellular injury, and progressive liver fibrosis. Resmetirom (MGL-3196) is a liver-directed, orally active, selective thyroid hormone receptor-β agonist designed to improve NASH by increasing hepatic fat metabolism and reducing lipotoxicity. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of resmetirom in patients with NASH.

- **Methods**: MGL-3196–05 was a 36-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study at 25 centres in the United States. Adults with biopsy-confirmed NASH (fibrosis stages 1–3) and a hepatic fat fraction of at least 10% at baseline, when assessed by MRI-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF), were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio by a computer-based system to receive resmetirom 80 mg or a matching placebo, orally once a day. Serial hepatic fat measurements were obtained at weeks 12 and 36, and a second liver biopsy was obtained at week 36. The primary endpoint was the relative change in MRI-PDFF assessed hepatic fat compared with placebo at week 12 in patients who had both a baseline and week 12 MRI-PDFF. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02912260.

- **Findings**: A total of 348 patients were screened and 84 were randomly assigned to resmetirom and 41 to placebo at 18 sites in the United States. Resmetirom-treated patients (n = 78) showed a relative reduction of hepatic fat compared with placebo (n = 38) at week 12 (-32.9% resmetirom vs. -10.4% placebo; least squares mean difference -22.5%, 95% CI -32.9 to -12.2; p < 0.0001) and week 36 (-37.3% resmetirom [n = 74] vs…

### Combination therapies in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease using antidiabetic and disease-specific drugs [^111KQp11]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Differences in the primary endpoint, defined as a ≥ 1-stage improvement in fibrosis without worsening of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), did not reach statistical significance between groups. However, combination treatment with cilofexor and firsocostat was more likely to achieve a ≥ 2-point improvement in the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) activity score compared to placebo (35% vs. 11%, P = 0.002), and ≥ 1-grade improvements in steatosis (26% vs. 6%, P = 0.009), ballooning (29% vs. 13%, P = 0.04), and lobular inflammation (57% vs. 29%, P = 0.004). Progression to cirrhosis was less frequent in patients treated with the combination of cilofexor and selonsertib than in those receiving placebo (8% vs. 41%, P = 0.018).

With firsocostat monotherapy, steatosis based on MRI-PDFF and liver histology was decreased compared to baseline (P = 0.033 and P = 0.017 vs. placebo at week 48, respectively). Steatosis according to MRI-PDFF was also reduced in all combination treatments compared to placebo at week 48. Interestingly, compared with placebo, cilofexor and firsocostat significantly decreased the ML NASH CRN fibrosis score (P = 0.04). Finally, all combination groups reduced the proportionate area of steatosis compared to placebo (P-values always < 0.05).

- **Semaglutide, cilofexor, and firsocostat**: A phase II open-label, randomized proof-of-concept trial evaluated the safety and tolerability of subcutaneous semaglutide (a GLP-1 agonist) alone or in combination with cilofexor and/or firsocostat in NASH patients with mild-to-moderate fibrosis (F2-F3) on biopsy or fat fraction ≥ 10% on MRI-PDFF and liver stiffness ≥ 7 kPa on transient elastography. Patients were randomized.

### Thyroid hormone analogues: An update [^111hVd3r]. Thyroid (2020). Low credibility.

Another compound that has been used in humans is MGL-3196, also called resmetirom. Its more complex chemical structure — a substituted pyridazinone ring replaces the phenolic ring, and a heterocyclic cyanoazauracil group is included in the side chain — allows nearly 30-fold TRβ selectivity.

All these compounds have been used in animal models of hypercholesterolemia, where they reduced total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol without significant changes in heart rate. Based on these preclinical findings, clinical trials were started. In 2008, both sobetirome and eprotirome were reported to produce a significant reduction in total and LDL cholesterol after 2–3 weeks of treatment in small groups of patients affected by hypercholesterolemia. Similar results were obtained with MGL-3196, which reduced serum triglycerides and LDL cholesterol after 2 weeks of treatment in 48 hypercholesterolemic patients. In patients treated with statins, the addition of eprotirome caused a further reduction in serum LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.

No significant side effects were reported in any of these investigations. Therefore, a phase 3 trial was undertaken to compare eprotirome (at the daily doses of 50 and 100 μg) versus placebo in 236 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. After 6 weeks, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were significantly reduced in both treatment groups, without any change in HDL cholesterol. However, the trial was interrupted (it was originally planned to last 52–76 weeks) because parallel experimental investigations found that eprotirome…

### Role of resmetirom, a liver-directed, thyroid hormone receptor beta-selective agonist, in managing nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116iT4vV]. Endocrine Practice (2024). High credibility.

Resmetirom, a liver-directed, thyroid hormone receptor beta-selective agonist, has recently been approved to treat nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). This meta-analysis aimed to summarize the efficiency and safety of resmetirom in treating NASH.

- **Methods**: Electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of resmetirom vs. placebo in patients with NASH. The primary outcomes were the changes from baseline in hepatic fat content, liver histology, including NASH resolution, and noninvasive markers of hepatic fibrosis.

- **Results**: Three randomized controlled trials (n = 2231) met the inclusion criteria. Compared to placebo, resmetirom achieved greater reductions from baseline in hepatic fat content assessed by magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction (for resmetirom 80 mg: MD -27.76% [95% CI: -32.84, -22.69]; for resmetirom 100 mg: MD -36.01% [95% CI: -41.54, -30.48]; P < .00001 for both) and FibroScan controlled attenuation parameter (for resmetirom 80 mg: MD -21.45 dBm [95% CI: -29.37, -13.52]; for resmetirom 100 mg: MD -25.51 dBm [95% CI: -33.53, -17.49]; P < .00001 for both). Resmetirom 80 mg outperformed placebo in NASH resolution and achieving a ≥ 2-point nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score reduction. Moreover, resmetirom 80 mg and 100 mg were superior to placebo in cytokeratin-18 (M30) reduction. Greater reductions in liver enzymes, lipids, and reverse triiodothyronine were observed in the resmetirom arms with no impact on triiodothyronine. Nausea and diarrhea were more common with resmetirom than with placebo.

### Expert panel recommendations: Practical clinical applications for initiating and monitoring resmetirom in patients with MASH/NASH and moderate to noncirrhotic advanced fibrosis [^1133QdYM]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease affects 1 in 4 people in the United States and Western Europe, with an important proportion developing metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), the progressive subtype of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. Cirrhosis caused by MASH is a leading indication for liver transplantation and the most common cause of hepatocellular carcinoma.

Hitherto, there have been no specific pharmacotherapies for MASH. The recent conditional approval by the Food and Drug Administration of resmetirom for the treatment of moderate or advanced MASH presents a much-anticipated therapeutic option for patients with noncirrhotic advanced MASH. Specifically, the intended population for resmetirom are patients with MASH and fibrosis stages 2 or 3. The approval of resmetirom also presents important challenges, including how to noninvasively identify patients with fibrosis stages 2–3, and how to exclude patients with more advanced disease who should not be treated until further data emerge on the use of resmetirom in this population.

Herein we consider the available literature with regard to identifying the intended population for treatment with resmetirom and in proposing criteria for stopping treatment.

### Eight weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for genotype 3 hepatitis C in previously untreated patients with significant (F2/3) fibrosis [^112LjHVx]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2020). Low credibility.

In the light of the available data, we speculated that 8-week SOF/VEL would be an appropriate treatment regimen for noncirrhotic patients. In order to maximize the number of patients treated and cured of their hepatitis C, we took a pragmatic decision to treat for 8 weeks. This off-label treatment duration allowed us to treat three patients for the price of two treatments as per the label.

Our results confirm the efficacy of this approach with excellent intention to treat (95.5%) and per-protocol (100%) results, and 8 weeks is now the recommended duration for treatment-naive GT3 patients with F0–3 disease in Scotland. Excellent results in a cohort of patients with significant drug use and high rates of OAT add to the growing body of evidence that drug use is not a barrier to successful HCV treatment. Two patients achieved SVR after 6 weeks of treatment, one with F2 fibrosis (LSM 8.8 kPa, viral load 6.7 log IU/ml) and one with F3 fibrosis (LSM 10.3 kPa, viral load 6.6 log IU/ml), indicating that for some patients, successful treatment is possible with even shorter durations of therapy. However, a further two patients with abbreviated treatment failed to achieve SVR: one F2 patient with a high viral load treated for 4 weeks (LSM 7.4 kPa, viral load 6.91 log IU/mL) and one F3 patient with HIV co-infection treated for 6 weeks (LSM 11.0, viral load 3.43 log IU/mL). Further work is required to better characterize those for whom less than 8 weeks of treatment is sufficient to achieve SVR.

- **Change in Ishak score at week 12**: The secondary endpoint, a ≥ 2 Ishak score improvement from baseline to Week 12, was observed in 5 patients from the 90‐mg BMS‐986263 arm (Figure 3). Most (3/5) had cirrhosis at baseline (i.e. an Ishak score of 5–6). Of patients who achieved ≥ 2 stage improvement in Ishak score, all 5 also had an improvement in fibrosis as determined by qFIB (Figure S6). A summary of the concordance of Ishak and qFIB responses at Week 12 is shown in Table S3 b.

### HCC incidence after hepatitis C cure among patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis: A meta-analysis [^112TdF4C]. Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (ID, CRD42021226955).

- **Eligibility criteria**: We included prospective and retrospective studies reporting HCC occurrence after HCV cure if they met the following criteria:

	- Study population included defined populations of patients with F3 fibrosis and/or cirrhosis, with no prior history of HCC, who achieved HCV cure (following interferon [IFN]-based or DAA therapy).
	- HCC incidence was reported or could be derived in person-years after HCV cure.
	- The cohort size was at least 20 patients.
	- The mean/median follow-up after the end of HCV treatment was at least 12 months.

We only included studies with at least 12 months of follow-up because studies with shorter follow-up likely identify a high proportion of HCC cases already present before HCV treatment. We required studies to define cirrhosis using liver biopsy, liver elastography, clinical or imaging features of cirrhosis, and/or a history of hepatic decompensation. F3 cohorts were defined using liver biopsy or elastography. Studies using laboratory results to define fibrosis stage (e.g. aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index or Fibrosis-4) were excluded. Studies also including patients with milder liver fibrosis (≤ F2), a history of HCC, or without HCV cure were only included if the incidence of de novo HCC could be derived for patients with F3 fibrosis and/or cirrhosis and HCV cure.

### Thyroid hormone receptor-beta agonist HSK31679 alleviates MASLD by modulating gut microbial sphingolipids [^111MAhTS]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Aims: As the first approved medication for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), the thyroid hormone receptor-β (THR-β) agonist MGL-3196 (resmetirom) has garnered much attention as a liver-directed, bioactive oral drug. However, studies on MGL-3196 have also identified remarkable heterogeneity of individual clinical efficacy, and its interference with gut microbiota in host hepatoenteral circulation remains to be elucidated.

Methods: We compared MASH attenuation by MGL-3196 and its derivative drug HSK31679 between germ-free (GF) and specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice to evaluate the role of gut microbiota. Cross-omics analyses of microbial metagenome, metabolome, and single-cell RNA-sequencing were applied to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple ascending dose cohort receiving HSK31679 treatment (n = 32) or placebo (n = 8), to comprehensively investigate the altered gut microbiota metabolism and circulating immune signatures.

Results: HSK31679 outperformed MGL-3196 in ameliorating MASH diet-induced steatohepatitis of SPF mice but not GF mice. In the multiple ascending dose cohort of HSK31679, the relative abundance of B. thetaiotaomicron was significantly enriched, impairing glucosylceramide synthase (GCS)-catalyzed monoglucosylation of microbial Cer(d18:1/16:0) and Cer(d18:1/24:1). In contrast to the non-inferior effect of MGL-3196 and HSK31679 on MASH resolution in GF BTΔGCS mice, HSK31679 led to superior benefit on steatohepatitis in GF BTWT mice, due to its steric hindrance of R123 and Y401 of gut microbial GCS.

Resmetirom is a highly selective thyroid hormone receptor-β agonist designed to improve metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease by increasing hepatic fat metabolism and reducing lipotoxicity. Thyroid hormone receptor-β is the predominant thyroid hormone receptor in the liver, and in animal models, it has been shown to influence several metabolic processes, such as the reduction of triglycerides and cholesterol and improvement of insulin sensitivity. Interim analysis of a phase III trial in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease recently finished, and resmetirom met both primary histologic endpoints and the key secondary endpoint (LDL cholesterol lowering) at both doses, being the first agent to achieve this. Cardiovascular endpoints are of interest in future studies, given the effects on lipid metabolism.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear receptor proteins that function as transcription factors regulating the expression of genes. They have multiple effects on glucose metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, inflammation, and fibrogenesis. Three PPAR isotypes have been identified: α, γ, and δ, all regulating different processes depending on the organ and cell type in which they are expressed. PPARα is the main target of fibrate drugs used in hypertriglyceridemia, and PPARγ is the primary target of thiazolidinediones, which are used for treating insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. There are currently no registered PPARδ agonist agents, but Seladelpar is being tested for primary biliary cholangitis and studied for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease as well. Despite the dominant role of PPARα, further research is needed to fully understand their potential.

### Bms-986263 in patients with advanced hepatic fibrosis: 36-week results from a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial [^115rJRBS]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

The study, identified as NCT03420768, was a Phase 2, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group study focused on adults with advanced hepatic fibrosis due to hepatitis C virus (HCV) who had achieved sustained virologic response (HCV‐SVR). Conducted at the Texas Liver Institute in San Antonio, TX, the study involved patients with documented SVR, defined as no detectable serum HCV RNA at least 12 weeks after completing antiviral therapy for a minimum of one year. Patients had advanced hepatic fibrosis (METAVIR F3 or F4) confirmed by local pathology interpretation of liver tissue obtained within eight weeks of screening.

Exclusion criteria comprised a Child‐Pugh score greater than 6, a Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease score exceeding 12, or evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) determined via serum concentration of alpha‐fetoprotein or imaging at screening. Patients with a history of hepatic decompensation, transplantation, or albumin levels above the upper limit of normal (ULN) were also excluded. Initially, the minimum allowable platelet count was 140,000/µL; however, to accommodate the frequent occurrence of thrombocytopenia in patients with cirrhosis, the protocol was amended to lower the platelet count threshold to below 100,000/µL toward the end of the enrollment period.

- **Study design**: Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1:2 ratio to receive either a placebo or BMS‐986263 at doses of 45 mg or 90 mg intravenously once weekly for 12 weeks. Liver biopsies were conducted within eight weeks before or during the screening period.

- **Randomization method**: An interactive response technology system facilitated randomization, following a computer‐generated block schedule.

### Current therapies and new developments in NASH [^115nMqWN]. Gut (2022). Low credibility.

Thyroid hormone receptor beta (THR-β) is crucial for liver homeostasis through multiple metabolic actions of thyroid hormones. THR-β agonists have been shown to improve lipid metabolism.

The THR-β agonist resmetirom has completed a phase II trial and is in two phase III 52-week trials. The 36-week phase II study with 125 participants showed a reduction of liver fat by an average of 30% compared with baseline by 12 weeks, leading to a significant resolution of NASH. Preliminary results from one of the phase III trials demonstrate positive results in imaging measurements of liver fat and liver stiffness, as well as a reduction in LDL-cholesterol and ApoB.

The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor involved in the control of bile acid (BA) synthesis and is also central to several pathways in the liver, affecting inflammation, fibrosis, lipid metabolism, and glucose metabolism. Obeticholic acid is a selective FXR agonist currently tested in a phase III trial of 1968 participants with NASH and fibrosis F2–F3. In an 18-month interim analysis, the drug met the endpoint of improvement by at least one stage in fibrosis with no worsening of NASH but did not meet the endpoint of NASH resolution. The main adverse event was pruritus and an increase in LDL cholesterol, responsive to statin therapy.

Aramchol, a partial inhibitor of hepatic stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1), has been tested in a phase 2b trial including 247 patients with NASH. Aramchol at the highest dose of 600 mg did not reach the prespecified significance level for decreasing hepatic fat content.

### The new paradigm of hepatitis C therapy: Integration of oral therapies into best practices [^116VFBUw]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2013). Low credibility.

Noninvasive methods of assessing histology are becoming more widely used, including the measurement of serum biomarkers of fibrosis and liver stiffness through elastography. These noninvasive methods have practically no complications and can be performed repeatedly to dynamically monitor the progression of fibrosis. The rate of adoption of noninvasive diagnostic tests for liver fibrosis differs between international regions, with the United States lagging behind Europe in this regard. The 2012 European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines for treating chronic hepatitis C suggest that while liver biopsy is still regarded as the reference method for grading inflammation and staging fibrosis, transient elastography can be used to assess liver fibrosis, and noninvasive serum markers are recommended for detecting significant fibrosis (METAVIR score F2-F4).

In 2004, the biomarker assay FibroSure (named FibroTest in Europe) was launched in the United States for assessing fibrosis and necroinflammatory activity. The assay, which can only be performed in validated laboratories, predicts a histology score based on patient age, sex, and results for serum haptoglobin, α2-macroglobulin, apolipoprotein A1, γ-glutamyltransferase, and bilirubin analyses. In a review of 25 studies in chronic HCV, FibroTest had an AUROC of 0.79 (0.70–0.89) for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis (F ≥ 2) and 0.86 (0.71–0.92) for liver cirrhosis.

### Vfend [^1132CpeT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Dosage modifications in patients with hepatic impairment**:

	- **Adults**: The maintenance dose of Vfend should be reduced in adult patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, classified as Child-Pugh Class A and B. There are no pharmacokinetic data to allow for dosage adjustment recommendations in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). The duration of therapy should be based on the severity of the patient's underlying disease, recovery from immunosuppression, and clinical response. Adult patients with baseline liver function tests (ALT, AST) of up to five times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were included in the clinical program. Dose adjustments are not necessary for adult patients with this degree of abnormal liver function, but continued monitoring of liver function tests for further elevations is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. It is recommended that the recommended Vfend loading dose regimens be used, but that the maintenance dose be halved in adult patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A and B) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

	- **Severe hepatic impairment**: Vfend has not been studied in adult patients with severe hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C) or in patients with chronic hepatitis B or chronic hepatitis C disease. Vfend has been associated with elevations in liver function tests and with clinical signs of liver damage, such as jaundice. Vfend should only be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Patients with hepatic impairment must be carefully monitored for drug toxicity.

### Current treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^114CvT8P]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Apart from the PPARγ agonist pioglitazone, which has been incorporated into international guidelines, several studies have reported data on the effects of PPAR‐δ, ‐α/δ, ‐α/γ, and most recently, pan‐PPAR agonists.

- **PPARδ agonist**: Seladelpar has shown an improvement in liver enzymes; however, it does not change hepatic fat as measured via MRI‐PDFF, and no full manuscript has yet been published.

- **PPARα/δ agonist**: Elafibranor did not meet the primary endpoint (NASH Resolution) in the large Phase III RESOLVE‐IT Trial.

- **PPARα/γ agonist**: Two Phase II trials investigating the effects of saroglitazar found improvement in ALT and hepatic fat (measured via MRI‐PDFF) but no improvement in NAS (primary endpoint: change in NAS from baseline to Week 24 biopsy).

- **Pan‐PPAR agonist**: Lanifibranor recently reached the primary endpoint of a decrease in the SAF‐A score by at least two points in a large Phase 2b trial. A dose‐dependent effect was observed, with more patients achieving the primary endpoint with 1200 mg versus 800 mg. Importantly, the resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis (49% with 1200 mg Lanifibranor, vs. 39% with 800 mg, vs. 22% placebo), improvement in fibrosis of at least one stage without worsening of NASH (48% vs. 34% vs. 22%), and resolution of NASH plus improvement in fibrosis stage of at least one (35% vs. 25% vs. 9%) all favored the study drug compared to placebo. Side effects, including diarrhea, nausea, peripheral edema, anemia, and weight gain, were observed more frequently in patients receiving Lanifibranor.

### Hepatic fibrosis: Concept to treatment [^114X3CCD]. Journal of Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying liver fibrogenesis is fundamentally relevant to developing new treatments that are independent of the underlying etiology. The increasing success of antiviral treatments in blocking or reversing the fibrogenic progression of chronic liver disease has unearthed vital information about the natural history of fibrosis regression and has established important principles and targets for antifibrotic drugs. Although antifibrotic activity has been demonstrated for many compounds in vitro and in animal models, none has been thoroughly validated in the clinic or commercialized as a therapy for fibrosis.

In addition, it is likely that combination therapies that affect two or more key pathogenic targets and/or pathways will be needed. To accelerate the preclinical development of these combination therapies, reliable single target validation is necessary, followed by the rational selection and systematic testing of combination approaches. Improved noninvasive tools for the assessment of fibrosis content, fibrogenesis, and fibrolysis must accompany in vivo validation in experimental fibrosis models, and especially in clinical trials.

The rapidly changing landscape of clinical trial design for liver disease is recognized by regulatory agencies in the United States (FDA) and Western Europe (EMA), who are working together with a broad range of stakeholders to standardize approaches to testing antifibrotic drugs in cohorts of patients with chronic liver diseases.

### Ocaliva [^114AhE63]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Important dosage and administration instructions**: Prior to the initiation of OCALIVA, healthcare providers should determine whether the patient has decompensated cirrhosis (e.g. Child-Pugh Class B or C), has had a prior decompensation event, or has compensated cirrhosis with evidence of portal hypertension (e.g. ascites, gastroesophageal varices, persistent thrombocytopenia) because OCALIVA is contraindicated in these patients [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Recommended dosage regimen**: The recommended dosage of OCALIVA for PBC patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis who do not have evidence of portal hypertension, who have not achieved an adequate biochemical response to an appropriate dosage of UDCA for at least 1 year or are intolerant to UDCA [see Clinical Studies (14)], follows below:

	- Start with a dosage of 5 mg once daily for the first 3 months.
	- After the first 3 months, for patients who have not achieved an adequate reduction in ALP and/or total bilirubin and who are tolerating OCALIVA, increase to a maximum dosage of 10 mg once daily.

- **Monitoring to assess safety, need for OCALIVA discontinuation**: Routinely monitor patients during OCALIVA treatment for biochemical response, tolerability, and progression of PBC. Closely monitor patients with compensated cirrhosis, concomitant hepatic disease (e.g. autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease), and/or severe interillness for new evidence of portal hypertension (e.g. ascites, gastroesophageal varices, persistent thrombocytopenia) or increases above.

### Rezdiffra [^112sYV7t]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Clinical studies**: The efficacy of Rezdiffra was evaluated based on an efficacy analysis at Month 12 in Trial 1 (NCT03900429), a 54-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Enrolled patients had metabolic risk factors and a baseline or recent liver biopsy showing NASH with fibrosis stage 2 or 3 and a NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) of at least 4. Efficacy determination was based on the effect of Rezdiffra on resolution of steatohepatitis without worsening of fibrosis and one stage improvement in fibrosis without worsening of steatohepatitis on post-baseline liver biopsies collected at 12 months.

- **Patient analysis**: The Month 12 analysis included 888 F2 and F3 (at eligibility) patients randomized 1:1:1 to receive placebo (n = 294), Rezdiffra 80 mg once daily (n = 298), or Rezdiffra 100 mg once daily (n = 296), in addition to lifestyle counseling on nutrition and exercise. Patients were on stable doses of medications for diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension.

- **Demographics and baseline characteristics**: Demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced between treatment and placebo groups. Overall, the median (Q1 to Q3) age of patients at baseline was 58 (51 to 65) years; 56% were female, 21% were Hispanic, 89% were White, 3% were Asian, and 2% were Black or African American. The median (Q1 to Q3) body mass index (BMI) was 35 (31 to 40) kg/m², and median (Q1 to Q3) body weight was 99 (85 to 114) kg. Baseline characteristics are presented in Table 7.

### Thyroid hormones and thyromimetics: A new approach to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^115Kt9w2]. Hepatology (2020).

Several issues arise from these studies. First, although resmetirom causes only small changes in serum fT4 levels and has relatively few side effects, it is still important to screen patients at risk for atrial arrhythmias and osteoporosis before considering treatment. The long-term health effects of resmetirom or other thyromimetics need to be monitored for both TH-specific and drug-specific effects.

Second, there was a lack of significant improvement in hepatic fibrosis by histology in the resmetirom- versus placebo-treatment groups; however, the study was not adequately powered to evaluate changes in fibrosis, and the time period of the study may not have been long enough to detect changes in fibrosis. Alternatively, it is possible that this drug may be more effective in earlier-stage NASH when there is less fibrosis or when the fibrosis is potentially still reversible. Stratifying patients according to NASH stage and examining their response, particularly with respect to fibrosis, will be useful.

Third, the issue of cost needs to be considered, particularly for patients in third-world countries where NASH is also highly prevalent. We have observed that hepatic DIO1 mRNA and activity decrease in late-stage NASH, leading to decreased intrahepatic T3 concentration. Thus, it is possible that low-dose levothyroxine (T4) may be effective to treat hepatosteatosis and early NASH, whereas low-dose T3 or thyromimetics that do not undergo DIO1 deiodination may be more useful for later stages of NASH.

### Pharmacokinetics of oltipraz and its major metabolite (RM) in patients with liver fibrosis or cirrhosis: Relationship with suppression of circulating TGF-beta1 [^117ADctC]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Oltipraz is a potential candidate drug for the treatment of liver fibrosis (LF) and liver cirrhosis (LC). The pharmacokinetics of oltipraz and its major rearranged metabolite, 7-methyl-6,8-bis(methylthio)H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine (RM), were evaluated after single-dose (30–90 mg) and multiple-dose (60 mg b.i.d. or 90 mg q.d. for 24 weeks) oral administration of oltipraz to patients with LF or LC. Oltipraz was safe and well-tolerated in both studies.

In the single-dose study, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), peak plasma concentration (C(max)), and terminal half-life (t(1/2)) of oltipraz, as well as the AUC of its RM, were dose-dependent. Oltipraz was rapidly absorbed; the time to reach C(max) (T(max)) was 2–4 hours. The conversion of oltipraz to RM was also rapid and substantial (AUC of RM from time 0 to the last measured concentration (AUC(last, RM))/AUC(last, oltipraz), 42–61%).

In the multiple-dose study, the level of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), a blood fibrosis marker, was suppressed at steady-state plasma concentrations of approximately 20–60 ng/ml of oltipraz or approximately 60–140 ng/ml of oltipraz plus RM. Overall, the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of oltipraz suggest that it may be helpful in the treatment of patients with LF or LC at an optimal dosing regimen.

### Pegasys [^115c2nPZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

- **Dosage modifications due to adverse reactions, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia in adults**: Table 2 displays the recommended PEGASYS dosage modifications due to adverse reactions, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia in adults. Following the improvement of the adverse reaction, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia, consider re-escalating the dosage back to the previous level [see Warnings and Precautions (5) and Adverse Reactions (6)].

- **Dosage modifications due to ALT elevation in adults**: If ALT levels increase progressively despite dose reduction, or if accompanied by increased bilirubin or evidence of hepatic decompensation, therapy should be immediately discontinued. In CHC patients with progressive ALT increases above baseline values, the dosage of PEGASYS should be reduced to 135 mcg, and more frequent liver function monitoring should be performed. After reducing or withholding PEGASYS, therapy can be resumed once ALT flares subside.

	- In CHB patients with ALT elevations (greater than 5 × ULN), more frequent monitoring of liver function should be performed, with consideration given to either reducing the dosage of PEGASYS to 135 mcg or temporarily discontinuing treatment. After reducing or withholding PEGASYS, therapy can be resumed after ALT flares subside.

	- In adult patients with persistent, severe hepatitis B flares (ALT greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal), consideration should be given to discontinuation of treatment.

- **Dosage modifications due to depression in adults and pediatric patients**: Details on the modifications specific to adult and pediatric patients experiencing depression are implied but not explicitly provided in the excerpt.

### Thyroid hormone analogues: An update [^112E8ASB]. Thyroid (2020). Low credibility.

NAFLD is frequently associated with insulin resistance, hypercholesterolemia, or other components of the so-called metabolic syndrome, and patients are usually treated for these underlying conditions. However, no specific treatment to prevent liver damage has been approved so far. In principle, thyroid hormones (TH) should be beneficial in NAFLD due to reduced fatty acid synthesis, increased triglyceride and fatty acid breakdown, and enhanced hepatocyte regeneration. The liver effects of TH are mediated by TRβ, so selective TRβ agonists have been tested in experimental models, and several compounds (including sobetirome, eprotirome, and MB07811) were able to reduce liver steatosis. Sobetirome was also reported to prevent the development of HCC induced by activation of the catenin pathway.

The study of TRβ agonists in NAFLD has just entered the clinical field, and the results of two clinical trials have recently been reported. In 116 patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH treated with MGL-3196 (resmetirom) (80 mg daily) for 12 weeks, liver fat, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, was significantly reduced: −7.0% versus −2.7% with placebo, if expressed as a percentage of absolute liver mass; −32.9% versus −10.4% if expressed as a percentage of baseline liver fat. The effect was retained after 36 weeks, and in a subgroup of patients, biopsy revealed a reduction of histological markers of inflammation.

Similar results were reported with VK2809 (alias MB07811) in 45 patients with NAFLD treated for 12 weeks at dosages of 10 mg every other day or 10 mg daily. In this trial, liver fat content was assessed.

### Current treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^114TH3fD]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Research shows that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a prevalent liver disorder with significant implications for health. Despite its prevalence, the treatment options for NAFLD remain limited and primarily focus on lifestyle interventions. **Diet and exercise**: Maintaining a healthy diet and engaging in regular physical activity are recommended as the first-line approaches for managing NAFLD. These lifestyle changes can significantly reduce liver fat and improve liver enzymes.

- **Pharmacological treatments**: Currently, there are no FDA-approved medications specifically for NAFLD. However, certain drugs intended for other conditions have shown potential benefits. These include vitamin E, pioglitazone, and obeticholic acid, though further research is required to confirm their efficacy and safety for NAFLD treatment.

- **Surgical and interventional therapies**: In cases where lifestyle and pharmacological treatments are insufficient, bariatric surgery may be considered, especially in patients with morbid obesity. This intervention has demonstrated improvements in liver histology and metabolic risk factors associated with NAFLD. However, it is important to note that this option is only applicable to a select group of patients based on the severity of disease and comorbid conditions.

Continued research and clinical trials are essential to develop targeted and effective therapies for NAFLD.

### Pharmacotherapy for NASH: Current and emerging [^1157W4bo]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become one of the most prominent forms of chronic liver disease worldwide, reflecting the epidemic of global obesity. Those with the progressive variant of NAFLD, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), are at significantly increased risk of multisystem morbidity and mortality. However, there are currently no approved pharmacologic therapies for NASH. Given the disease burden, there is an important unmet need for pharmacologic treatment options for this patient population.

The underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms that contribute to the development and progression of NAFLD and NASH are complex and reflected by the myriad of therapies, with different targets, currently under investigation. In broad strokes, drug development has focused on modulation of metabolic pathways, inflammatory cascades, and/or mechanisms impacting fibrosis. Although much progress has been made in enhancing our understanding of NAFLD pathogenesis, development of pharmacologic treatments has been hindered by challenges in clinical trial enrollment and complexities in clinical trial design.

The compounds in phase IIa have provided promising results in terms of potential benefits on various aspects of histopathology. Agents in later stages of development have shown fairly modest results in terms of reduction of hepatic steatosis, necroinflammation, and fibrosis. If longer-term safety and efficacy are established among heterogeneous cohorts, these medications may help mitigate potential morbidity and mortality for this burgeoning patient population.
