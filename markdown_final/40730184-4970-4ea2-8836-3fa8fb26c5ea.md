## Question

Can you give amio for sinus tach

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether amiodarone should be used for sinus tachycardia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "sinus tachycardia" encompasses and whether there are subtypes with different management. Then, I should verify amiodarone's FDA-approved indications and boxed warnings. Next, I will review contemporary guideline recommendations for sinus tachycardia and inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST), and check if amiodarone appears anywhere relevant. After that, I need to evaluate amiodarone's risk profile and time to onset to see if the risk-benefit makes sense here. Finally, I will consider appropriate alternatives and outline a practical approach, while double-checking for any niche exceptions where amiodarone might be considered in SVT but not sinus tachycardia specifically [^114KeoD1] [^112459Bv].

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. "Sinus tachycardia" includes physiologic or secondary sinus tachycardia driven by an underlying cause, inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST), and conditions like POTS; management hinges on identifying triggers for physiologic forms and structured symptom-directed therapy for primary forms, with IST being a diagnosis of exclusion and generally benign from a prognostic standpoint, despite significant symptom burden [^114KeoD1] [^112459Bv] [^117FrYK9].

> I should verify amiodarone's labeling before drawing conclusions. The FDA indication for amiodarone (Pacerone) is restricted to documented, life‑threatening recurrent ventricular fibrillation or hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia in adults who have failed other agents, with a boxed warning to reserve use for such life-threatening arrhythmias due to substantial toxicity, which does not include sinus tachycardia as an indication [^1148gwhd] [^113Qeczr].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I need to check guidelines. For symptomatic SVT without pre-excitation, ongoing pharmacologic management recommendations favor beta‑blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil, whereas expert reviews on sinus tach emphasize treating underlying causes for appropriate sinus tach and individualized strategies for IST; I don't see amiodarone recommended for sinus tachycardia or IST in these pathways [^11696cDx] [^1136yHDD] [^114KeoD1] [^112459Bv].

> Hmm, wait a minute — I initially thought amiodarone might be endorsed broadly for SVTs, but I should double-check the specific contexts. Let me verify: IV amiodarone appears as a consideration for hemodynamically stable AVNRT when other therapies are ineffective or contraindicated, and for focal atrial tachycardia or antidromic AVRT in refractory situations, which are mechanistically distinct from sinus tachycardia; this does not translate to a role in treating sinus tachycardia itself, and the drug's slow onset further undermines any acute utility for sinus tach [^115aBUqq] [^113i1feu] [^115Sf4TH] [^113JkPyZ].

> I need to assess risk carefully. Amiodarone carries substantial toxicities: pulmonary toxicity with reported fatality, hepatotoxicity, thyroid dysfunction, optic neuropathy, proarrhythmia including TdP, and bradyarrhythmias or sinus arrest; adverse effects are common and often lead to discontinuation, and formal contraindications include significant bradyarrhythmias without pacing support, all of which create an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio for a generally benign rhythm diagnosis like sinus tachycardia [^113Qeczr] [^113LZuW7] [^117LW65H] [^113fHQnJ] [^112Rmfdh].

> Let me consider appropriate alternatives and label-supported solutions. For noncompensatory sinus tachycardia requiring rapid short‑term control in peri‑procedural or emergent settings, esmolol is specifically labeled and is short‑acting, which allows safe titration; for IST, beta‑blockers are typically first‑line and ivabradine has demonstrated symptomatic and heart rate improvements in randomized and pooled prospective studies; calcium channel blockers are endorsed for SVT symptom control in selected patients, and lifestyle/conditioning strategies are important in IST care [^112rndtV] [^116X3u4t] [^117R5VHc] [^11696cDx] [^112459Bv].

> I should outline a practical approach. First, rule out secondary drivers of sinus tachycardia such as infection, hypovolemia, anemia, pulmonary embolism, hyperthyroidism, pain, withdrawal, and medication effects; next, if IST is likely, consider beta‑blocker or ivabradine based on patient profile, reserving CCBs in appropriate scenarios; avoid amiodarone because the indication, onset profile, and toxicity do not fit the problem; and in refractory IST with disabling symptoms, involve electrophysiology for advanced options like sinus node–sparing ablation, recognizing variable efficacy and risks [^114KeoD1] [^112459Bv].

> But wait, what if someone cites amiodarone use in "tachycardia" cases? I need to clarify that such reports often involve non‑sinus SVTs or ventricular arrhythmias, or special populations like postoperative pediatric junctional ectopic tachycardia or hydropic fetal SVT, which are distinct entities; these niche uses do not support amiodarone for routine adult sinus tachycardia management [^113qXbVM] [^116cBf4b].

> Final check and conclusion: Considering the lack of indication, the absence of guideline support for sinus tachycardia or IST, the slow time to effect, and the substantial toxicity profile, amiodarone should not be used for sinus tachycardia; instead, address underlying causes, use beta‑blockers or ivabradine as appropriate, and reserve amiodarone for life‑threatening ventricular arrhythmias or select refractory SVTs per guidelines after safer options fail [^1148gwhd] [^113Qeczr] [^11696cDx] [^114KeoD1] [^112459Bv].

---

No, amiodarone is **not indicated for sinus tachycardia**. Because of its significant toxicity profile, it is reserved for **life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias** and select refractory supraventricular tachycardias [^1148gwhd] [^113Qeczr]. Sinus tachycardia is best managed by **addressing underlying causes**, with beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers used when needed [^112459Bv] [^111Yq1ia]. Amiodarone should be considered only in rare, refractory cases when other therapies have failed or are contraindicated, and then with close monitoring for serious adverse effects [^113Qeczr] [^113LZuW7].

---

## Indications for amiodarone

Amiodarone is **primarily indicated** for the following arrhythmias:

- **Ventricular fibrillation (VF)**: Life-threatening, recurrent, refractory [^1148gwhd].

- **Ventricular tachycardia (VT)**: Life-threatening, recurrent, refractory, hemodynamically unstable [^1148gwhd].

- **Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)**: Off-label use for rhythm control in refractory cases [^117Y97dE].

- **Atrial fibrillation (AF)**: Off-label use for rate control and pharmacological cardioversion in selected patients [^117Y97dE].

---

## Sinus tachycardia: definition and management

Sinus tachycardia is characterized by a sinus rhythm with a **heart rate exceeding 100 beats per minute**. There are two main types: **appropriate sinus tachycardia**, secondary to identifiable causes such as fever, anemia, hyperthyroidism, hypovolemia, or anxiety [^112459Bv]; and **inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST)**, a persistently elevated heart rate without identifiable secondary causes, often associated with autonomic dysfunction [^112459Bv]. Management primarily involves **identifying and treating underlying causes**, with pharmacological options — such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers — considered for symptomatic patients or those with IST [^112459Bv].

---

## Amiodarone in sinus tachycardia: clinical evidence

There is **limited clinical evidence** supporting amiodarone for sinus tachycardia. While it prolongs the cardiac action potential and refractory period — making it effective for ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias — its use in sinus tachycardia is not well documented or supported by clinical guidelines. A study by Ortiz et al. (2017) compared intravenous procainamide and amiodarone for acute treatment of wide QRS tachycardia but **did not address sinus tachycardia** [^113ZjmEG]. Similarly, other studies have focused on amiodarone's efficacy in ventricular arrhythmias or atrial fibrillation rather than sinus tachycardia [^112Xa29A] [^1178XVrt].

---

## Risks and contraindications of amiodarone

Amiodarone is associated with **significant risks and contraindications**, including:

- **Pulmonary toxicity**: Interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [^113Qeczr].

- **Hepatic toxicity**: Elevated liver enzymes, hepatitis, and hepatic failure [^113Qeczr].

- **Thyroid dysfunction**: Hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism due to iodine content.

- **Cardiac toxicity**: Bradycardia, QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, and exacerbation of arrhythmias [^113Qeczr].

- **Ocular toxicity**: Corneal microdeposits, optic neuropathy, and visual impairment.

- **Dermatological reactions**: Photosensitivity, blue-gray skin discoloration.

- **Neurological effects**: Peripheral neuropathy, tremors, ataxia.

Contraindications include:

- **Cardiogenic shock**.

- **Severe sinus-node dysfunction**.

- **Second- or third-degree AV block**: Without a functioning pacemaker [^112Rmfdh].

- **Bradycardia**: Leading to syncope without a functioning pacemaker [^112Rmfdh].

- **Hypersensitivity**: To amiodarone or iodine [^112Rmfdh].

Given these risks, amiodarone is typically **reserved for life-threatening arrhythmias** or refractory cases in which other treatments have failed.

---

## Alternative treatments for sinus tachycardia

Alternative pharmacological treatments for sinus tachycardia include:

- **Beta-blockers**: First-line therapy for symptomatic sinus tachycardia or IST [^112459Bv].

- **Calcium channel blockers**: Verapamil or diltiazem for rate control in symptomatic patients [^112459Bv].

- **Ivabradine**: Selective sinus node inhibitor effective in reducing heart rate and symptoms in IST [^116X3u4t].

Non-pharmacological interventions include lifestyle modifications, catheter ablation, or surgical sinus node modification for refractory cases [^112459Bv].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines and expert recommendations **do not support the routine use** of amiodarone for sinus tachycardia. It is reserved for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias or refractory supraventricular arrhythmias, and for sinus tachycardia is considered only in rare, refractory cases when other treatments have failed or are contraindicated.

---

Amiodarone is **not indicated for sinus tachycardia** given its significant toxicity and lack of supporting clinical evidence; it should be considered only in rare, refractory cases when other treatments have failed or are contraindicated. Alternative treatments — such as beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or ivabradine — are preferred for managing sinus tachycardia.

### Inappropriate sinus tachycardia: Etiology, pathophysiology, and management: JACC review topic of the week [^112459Bv]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is a clinical syndrome that generally affects young patients and is associated with distressing symptoms. Although the most common symptom is palpitations, it can be accompanied by a myriad of symptoms, including anxiety, dizziness, presyncope, and syncope. The pathogenesis of IST is not well understood and is considered multifactorial, with autonomic dysfunction being the central abnormality. IST is a diagnosis of exclusion. Management presents a clinical challenge. The overall efficacy of lifestyle modifications and medical therapy may be limited. Recent advances in catheter and surgical sinus node sparing ablation techniques have led to improvement in outcomes. Moreover, an increased focus on developing multimodality, team-based interventions has been seen to improve outcomes in this group of patients.

### Pacerone [^113LZuW7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Worsened arrhythmia**: Pacerone can exacerbate the presenting arrhythmia in about 2% to 5% of patients or cause new ventricular fibrillation, incessant ventricular tachycardia, increased resistance to cardioversion, and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia associated with QTc prolongation (Torsade de Pointes [TdP]).

	- Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia before initiating treatment with amiodarone hydrochloride, as these disorders can exaggerate the degree of QTc prolongation and increase the potential for TdP. Give special attention to electrolyte and acid-base balance in patients experiencing severe or prolonged diarrhea or receiving drugs affecting electrolyte levels, such as diuretics, laxatives, systemic corticosteroids, or amphotericin B.

- **Visual impairment and loss of vision**:

	**Optic neuropathy and optic neuritis**: Cases of optic neuropathy and optic neuritis, usually resulting in visual impairment and sometimes permanent blindness, have been reported in patients treated with amiodarone and may occur at any time during therapy. If symptoms of visual impairment appear, such as changes in visual acuity and decreases in peripheral vision, consider discontinuing Pacerone and promptly refer for ophthalmic examination. Regular ophthalmic examination, including funduscopy and slit-lamp examination, is recommended during administration of Pacerone.

	**Corneal microdeposits**: Corneal microdeposits appear in the majority of adults treated with amiodarone hydrochloride. They are usually discernible only by slit-lamp examination.

### Pacerone [^1148gwhd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Pacerone is indicated for the treatment of documented, life-threatening recurrent ventricular fibrillation and life-threatening hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia in adults who have not responded to adequate doses of other available antiarrhythmics or when alternative agents cannot be tolerated.

- **Indications and usage**:
	- **Pacerone is an antiarrhythmic indicated for**:
	- Recurrent ventricular fibrillation
	- Recurrent hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia

---

### Pacerone [^113Qeczr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Warning: Pulmonary, hepatic, and cardiac toxicity**: Pacerone is intended for use only in patients with indicated life-threatening arrhythmias, as its use is accompanied by substantial toxicity [see Indications and Usage (1)].

- **Pulmonary toxicity**: Pacerone can cause pulmonary toxicity, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis or interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis, resulting in clinically manifest disease at rates of up to 17% in some patient series. Pulmonary toxicity has been fatal about 10% of the time. A baseline chest X-ray and pulmonary-function tests, including diffusion capacity, should be obtained when Pacerone therapy is initiated. Repeat history, physical exams, and chest X-rays every 3 to 6 months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Hepatic toxicity**: Pacerone can cause hepatotoxicity, which can be fatal. Obtain baseline and periodic liver transaminases. Discontinue or reduce the dose if the increase exceeds three times normal or doubles in a patient with an elevated baseline. Discontinue Pacerone if the patient experiences signs or symptoms of clinical liver injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Cardiac toxicity**: Pacerone can exacerbate arrhythmias. Initiate amiodarone hydrochloride in a clinical setting where continuous electrocardiograms and cardiac resuscitation are available [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **Final warning**: See full prescribing information for the complete boxed warning. Reserve Pacerone for patients with indicated life-threatening arrhythmias due to associated substantial toxicity, some of which are also life-threatening. Utilize alternative agents when possible.

### Inappropriate sinus tachycardia [^111Yq1ia]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is a syndrome where the sinus heart rate is inexplicably faster than expected, with associated symptoms. The heart rate at rest, even in a supine position, can exceed 100 beats per minute; minimal activity accelerates the rate rapidly and substantially. Patients with IST may require restriction from physical activity.

The mechanisms responsible for IST are not completely understood. It is important to distinguish IST from appropriate sinus tachycardia and from postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, with which overlap may occur. Because the long-term outcome seems to be benign, treatment may be unnecessary or as simple as physical training. However, for patients with intolerable symptoms, therapeutic measures are warranted.

Even at high doses, β-adrenergic blockers, the first-line therapy, often are ineffective; the same is true for most other medical therapies. In rare instances, catheter- or surgically-based right atrial or sinus node modification may be helpful, but even this is fraught with limited efficacy and potential complications. Overtreatment, in an attempt to reduce symptoms, can be difficult to avoid but is discouraged.

### A comparison of rate control and rhythm control in patients with atrial fibrillation [^113kJ4ki]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

There are two approaches to the treatment of atrial fibrillation: one is cardioversion and treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs to maintain sinus rhythm, and the other is the use of rate-controlling drugs, allowing atrial fibrillation to persist. In both approaches, the use of anticoagulant drugs is recommended.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomized, multicenter comparison of these two treatment strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation and a high risk of stroke or death. The primary endpoint was overall mortality.

- **Results**: A total of 4060 patients (mean [± SD] age, 69.7 ± 9.0 years) were enrolled in the study; 70.8 percent had a history of hypertension, and 38.2 percent had coronary artery disease. Of the 3311 patients with echocardiograms, the left atrium was enlarged in 64.7 percent, and left ventricular function was depressed in 26.0 percent. There were 356 deaths among the patients assigned to rhythm-control therapy and 310 deaths among those assigned to rate-control therapy (mortality at five years, 23.8 percent and 21.3 percent, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.15 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.34]; P = 0.08). More patients in the rhythm-control group than in the rate-control group were hospitalized, and there were more adverse drug effects in the rhythm-control group as well. In both groups, the majority of strokes occurred after warfarin had been stopped or when the international normalized ratio was subtherapeutic.

- **Conclusions**: Management of atrial fibrillation with the rhythm-control strategy offers no survival advantage over the rate-control strategy.

### Amiodarone as a first-line therapy for postoperative junctional ectopic tachycardia [^113qXbVM]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Postoperative junctional ectopic tachycardia is a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia that is often resistant to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs. Amiodarone was suggested to be an adequate treatment; however, data regarding its efficacy and safety are limited. This study evaluated the efficacy of amiodarone in the first-line treatment of postoperative junctional ectopic tachycardia and assessed factors associated with failure of amiodarone therapy.

- **Methods**: The study included 40 pediatric cardiosurgical patients with postoperative junctional ectopic tachycardia. Intravenous amiodarone in 2-mg/kg boluses and, if necessary, as continuous infusion (10 to 15 µg/kg/min), were used as the first-line therapy. Restoration of sinus rhythm or slowing of junctional ectopic tachycardia to a rate that allowed atrial or atrioventricular sequential pacing was considered as efficacy of therapy.

- **Results**: Amiodarone was effective in 18 patients (45%). Sinus rhythm was achieved in 7, and heart rate decreased in 11 patients from 180 (range, 173 to 200) to 142 (range, 133–155) beats/min (p < 0.0001) and allowed effective pacing with atrioventricular synchrony. Higher arteriovenous oxygen saturation difference (p = 0.007) and lower body temperature (p = 0.02) were associated with failure of amiodarone therapy.

- **Conclusions**: Amiodarone as the first-line treatment was effective in almost half of the patients with postoperative junctional ectopic tachycardia. Higher arteriovenous oxygen saturation difference and lower body temperature were associated with failure of amiodarone therapy.

### Is rhythm control superior to rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure [^111WMXCK]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

In a study involving 1,009 patients with atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure, the 2-year mortality rate was observed to be 31% in patients treated with rate control (n = 505), compared to 29% in those receiving rhythm control (n = 504). After adjusting for differences in baseline characteristics and medications, no significant difference in mortality was found between the two groups.

### Randomized comparison of intravenous procainamide vs. intravenous amiodarone for the acute treatment of tolerated wide QRS tachycardia: the PROCAMIO study [^111ALxmc]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is an uncommon but dangerous medical condition with a highly variable clinical presentation, ranging from almost asymptomatic to causing cardiac arrest. When a patient's clinical condition, such as stable blood pressure and the absence of overt heart failure signs, is maintained upon seeking medical attention, VT is often referred to as 'stable' or 'well-tolerated'. Although it may remain stable for minutes or even hours, it requires urgent intervention due to the risk of haemodynamic instability and potential deterioration leading to collapse.

Termination of VT can be achieved through electrical cardioversion, antiarrhythmic medications, and pacing techniques. According to guideline recommendations, intravenous procainamide and amiodarone are considered drugs of choice for the treatment of haemodynamically stable VT, with a class II recommendation. Despite the longstanding clinical use of both drugs, there is no scientific evidence supporting the preference of one over the other in this particular clinical setting. Controlled trials with amiodarone have been conducted in other scenarios, such as hypotensive VT or cardiac arrest, while procainamide has been compared with other antiarrhythmic drugs. However, no controlled prospective trial has focused on comparing these two agents in well-tolerated VT.

The PROCAMIO study is a multicenter, prospective, and randomized trial that compares the safety and efficacy of intravenous procainamide and amiodarone.

### Amiodarone — avoid the danger of torsade de pointes [^113sussL]. Resuscitation (2008). Low credibility.

We present two patients who experienced life-threatening arrhythmias, which are highly likely to be secondary to amiodarone. This class III anti-arrhythmic is commonly prescribed for the acute presentation of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. However, occasionally its use can transform arrhythmias from benign to dangerous. These cases highlight the need for careful attention to the indications, cautions, and contraindications of amiodarone, as well as the need for vigilance following the initiation of anti-arrhythmic therapy.

### SPL drug information for amiodarone hydrochloride [^113HcKH9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

The dosage of amiodarone hydrochloride PO for the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia in adults (ongoing management) is as follows:

- **Starting dosage**: 400–600 mg PO daily, taken in divided doses, for 2–4 weeks.
- **Maintenance dosage**: 100–200 mg PO daily.

This structured dosing regimen aims at effective long-term management of supraventricular tachycardia in adults.

### Amiodarone: Guidelines for use and monitoring [^111SLjpo]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is a potent antiarrhythmic agent used to treat ventricular arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation. The drug prevents the recurrence of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and produces a modest reduction in sudden deaths in high-risk patients. Amiodarone is more effective than sotalol or propafenone in preventing atrial fibrillation in patients for whom a rhythm-control strategy is chosen. When long-term amiodarone therapy is used, potential drug toxicity and interactions must be considered. The dosage of amiodarone should be kept at the lowest effective level.

In patients who are also taking digoxin and warfarin, physicians must pay close attention to digoxin levels and prothrombin time, keeping in mind that the effects of interaction with amiodarone do not peak until seven weeks after the initiation of concomitant therapy. Laboratory studies to assess liver and thyroid function should be performed at least every six months.

Circulation (2016). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for focal atrial tachycardia, more specifically with respect to acute management, the ACC/AHA/HRS 2016 guidelines recommend considering the administration of adenosine in the acute setting. This approach is to either restore sinus rhythm or diagnose the tachycardia mechanism in patients with suspected FAT.

### Randomized comparison of intravenous procainamide vs. intravenous amiodarone for the acute treatment of tolerated wide QRS tachycardia: The PROCAMIO study [^113ZjmEG]. European Heart Journal (2017). High credibility.

The PROCAMIO study, published in 2017 in the European Heart Journal, investigated the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. The trial addressed the effect of intravenous procainamide versus amiodarone in patients experiencing an acute episode of sustained monomorphic well-tolerated wide QRS tachycardia. It was a multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial comprising 74 patients. Inclusion criteria required patients to have regular wide QRS complex tachycardia necessitating medical attention. Key exclusion criteria included recent treatment with either IV amiodarone or IV procainamide within the past 24 hours, poor hemodynamic tolerance requiring urgent termination, or ventricular tachycardia.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Procainamide group**: n = 33 received an IV infusion of a single dose of 10 mg/kg over 20 minutes.
	- **Amiodarone group**: n = 29 received an IV infusion of a single dose of 5 mg/kg over 20 minutes.

- **Primary outcome**:
	- There was a significant decrease in major cardiac adverse events in the procainamide group (9% vs. 41%; OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.6).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- A significant increase in tachycardia termination was observed in the procainamide group (67% vs. 38%; OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.2 to 9.3).
	- There was a borderline significant decrease in total adverse events in the procainamide group (24% vs. 48%; OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.12 to 1).
	- No significant difference in adverse events between groups (18% vs. 31%; OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.61).

- **Safety outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in total adverse effects was observed in patients with structural heart issues.

The study provides insights into the efficacy and safety of procainamide compared to amiodarone in this patient population.

### Sotalol hydrochloride [^1125CmqL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Indications and usage**: Sotalol is an antiarrhythmic indicated for:
	- The maintenance of normal sinus rhythm [delay in time to recurrence of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter in patients with symptomatic AFIB/AFL] who are currently in sinus rhythm.
	- The treatment of life-threatening ventricular tachycardia.

- **Delay in recurrence of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter**: Sotalol is indicated for the maintenance of normal sinus rhythm [delay in time to recurrence of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter (AFIB/AFL)] in patients with symptomatic AFIB/AFL who are currently in sinus rhythm.

- **Life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia**: Sotalol is indicated for the treatment of life-threatening ventricular tachycardia. Antiarrhythmic drugs may not enhance survival in patients with ventricular arrhythmias.

### Amiodarone for pediatric resuscitation: a word of caution [^114iNTY8]. Pediatric Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Intravenous administration of amiodarone has recently been recommended for use during pediatric resuscitation of patients with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. We present two pediatric patients who received amiodarone for polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, although they were ultimately determined to have congenital long QT syndrome. Amiodarone is contraindicated in this setting and may have exacerbated the ventricular arrhythmia.

- **Methods: Study design and randomization**: Patients were randomly assigned in an open-labeled fashion to receive either intravenous procainamide (single dose 10 mg/kg over 20 minutes) or intravenous amiodarone (single dose 5 mg/kg over 20 minutes) with a 1:1 ratio. The study period was 40 minutes from infusion initiation (20 minutes for drug administration and 20 minutes following administration). There was an observation period of 24 hours after the end of the study period.

The randomization procedure was as follows: since a rapid decision needed to be made regarding the drug assigned, groups of 10 numbered and closed envelopes were deposited at each center (and were replaced as necessary). Thus, whenever a candidate appeared, the investigator could open the next envelope containing the assigned therapy. The study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki. Both Cardiology and Emergency Departments participated at different centers to include a representative patient population. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee at each center, and informed consent of the subjects was obtained before enrollment. The trial was registered in Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00383799).

- **Patient selection**: Patients with regular wide QRS complex tachycardia that required medical attention were included in the study if they had the following conditions: (i) regular heart rhythm with a rate ≥ 120 bpm; (ii) tachycardia QRS duration ≥ 120 ms; (iii) good hemodynamic tolerance defined as: (a) systolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg, (b) absence of dyspnea at rest, (c) absence of…

### A practical guide for clinicians who treat patients with amiodarone: 2007 [^113L8aRS]. Heart Rhythm (2007). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is commonly used to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias in various inpatient and outpatient settings. Overuse and underuse of amiodarone are common, and data regarding patterns of use are sparse and largely anecdotal. Because of adverse drug reactions, proper use is essential to deriving optimal benefits from the drug with the least risk. This guide updates an earlier version published in 2000, reviews indications for the use of amiodarone, and recommends strategies to minimize adverse effects. The recommendations included herein are based on the best available data and the collective experience of the members of the writing committee.

### Esmolol for intractable ventricular arrhythmias in major amitriptyline toxicity [^112WRvdg]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Prevention of sinus tachycardia in experimental amitriptyline toxicity through methods such as sinus node destruction, beta-blockers, direct vagal stimulation, physostigmine, and specific bradycardia agents like zatebradine can effectively prevent ventricular tachyarrhythmias and reduce QRS prolongation.

Beta-blockade infusion was chosen for our patient to reduce the heart rate because we observed that QRS and QT prolongation increased with rate. Arrhythmias and triggered automaticity occurred exclusively when the heart rate was greater than 110 and QRS was prolonged. We aimed to prevent tachycardia and ventricular arrhythmias despite the risks of reduced cardiac contractility.

Any potential reduction in contractility or blood pressure could be offset by careful titration of esmolol to a safe rate, the restoration of a perfusing rhythm, and, in extremis, the use of a cardiac support device such as IABP or ECMO. In this case, we minimized the dose of esmolol by titrating to a pulse range of less than 100 beats/min and more than 80 beats/min. The malignant rhythm reappeared once the pulse rate exceeded 110 beats/min at several different times in her course. The intervention was successful, as demonstrated by the fact that premature cessation of esmolol infusion on two occasions led to tachycardia and recurrence of ventricular tachycardia, followed by fibrillation.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of amiodarone hydrochloride PO (also known as Pacerone, Nexterone):

- **Amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders**: Use caution, as amiodarone can cause thyroid abnormalities, including hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism.

- **Bradycardia**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone can cause symptomatic bradycardia or sinus arrest, especially in the presence of electrolytic disorders or concomitant use of antiarrhythmics or negative chronotropes.

- **Conduction disorders**: Use caution in patients undergoing surgery, as amiodarone may increase sensitivity to the myocardial depressant and conduction effects of halogenated inhalational anesthetics.

- **Interference with implanted cardiac devices**: Use caution in patients with implanted defibrillators or pacemakers, as chronic use of antiarrhythmic drugs may affect pacing and defibrillation thresholds.

- **Peripheral neuropathy**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone has been associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy.

- **Persistence of adverse effects**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as adverse reactions and drug interactions can persist for several weeks after discontinuation due to the long half-life of amiodarone.

- **Photosensitivity of skin, skin discoloration**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone can induce photosensitization and cause blue-gray discoloration of the skin with long-term use.

- **Visual disturbances**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone has been associated with an increased risk of optic neuropathy and optic neuritis.

### Oral class I and III antiarrhythmic drugs for maintaining sinus rhythm after catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation [^112mWQAb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmias (ATa) following catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common problem. Antiarrhythmic drugs have been used shortly after ablation in an attempt to maintain sinus rhythm, particularly Class I and III agents. However, it still needs to be established if the use of Class I or III antiarrhythmic medications, or both, reduces the risk of recurrence of ATa.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of oral Class I and III antiarrhythmic drugs versus control (standard medical therapy without Class I or III antiarrhythmics, or placebo) for maintaining sinus rhythm in people undergoing catheter ablation for AF.

- **Search methods**: We systematically searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, and two clinical trial registers without restrictions on language or date up to August 5, 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We sought published, unpublished, and ongoing parallel-design, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving adult participants undergoing ablation for AF, with subsequent comparison of Class I and/or III antiarrhythmic use versus control (standard medical therapy or non-Class I and/or III antiarrhythmic use).

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane and performed meta-analyses with risk ratios (RR) and Peto odds ratios (Peto OR). Our primary outcomes were recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmias; adverse events: thromboembolic events; adverse events: myocardial infarction; adverse events: new diagnosis of heart failure; and adverse events: requirement for one.

### Therapy-resistant ventricular tachycardia caused by amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis: A case report of electrical storm [^115wY88R]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

An electrical storm is a challenging diagnosis for the clinician and requires detailed evaluation of the patient. Amiodarone is frequently used for the cessation of ventricular tachycardia attacks. Among its antiarrhythmic effects, there are some harmful effects of the drug. Thyroid gland toxicity is one of the most important adverse effects of amiodarone and is called amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. Thyrotoxicosis may alter arrhythmia and lead to frequent ventricular tachycardia attacks. Herein, we report a case of electrical storm caused by amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis.

### Pacerone [^113JkPyZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

There is no well-established relationship between plasma concentration and effectiveness, but it does appear that concentrations much below 1 mg/L are often ineffective and that levels above 2.5 mg/L are generally not needed. Plasma-concentration measurements can be used to identify patients whose levels are unusually low, who might benefit from a dose increase, or unusually high, who might require dosage reduction in the hope of minimizing side effects.

- **Effects on abnormal rhythms**: Effects are not seen before 2 to 3 days and usually require 1 to 3 weeks, even when a loading dose is used. There may be a continued increase in effect for longer periods still. There is evidence that the time to effect is shorter when a loading-dose regimen is used.

- **Consistent with the slow rate of elimination**: Antiarrhythmic effects persist for weeks or months after amiodarone hydrochloride is discontinued. However, the time of recurrence is variable and unpredictable. In general, when the drug is resumed after recurrence of the arrhythmia, control is established relatively rapidly compared to the initial response, presumably because tissue stores were not wholly depleted.

### Brevibloc [^112rndtV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Brevibloc injection is a beta-adrenergic blocker indicated for the short-term treatment of:

- **Supraventricular tachycardia or noncompensatory sinus tachycardia**: Brevibloc (Esmolol Hydrochloride) injection is indicated for the rapid control of ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. It is specifically for use in perioperative, postoperative, or other emergent circumstances where short-term control of ventricular rate with a short-acting agent is desirable. Additionally, it is used in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia where, in the physician's judgment, the rapid heart rate requires specific intervention. Brevibloc injection is intended for short-term use.

- **Intraoperative and postoperative tachycardia and/or hypertension**: Brevibloc (Esmolol Hydrochloride) injection is indicated for the short-term treatment of tachycardia and hypertension that occur during induction and tracheal intubation, during surgery, on emergence from anesthesia, and in the postoperative period, when in the physician's judgment such specific intervention is considered indicated. The use of Brevibloc injection to prevent such events is not recommended.

### Sinus tachycardia: a multidisciplinary expert focused review [^114KeoD1]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2022). Low credibility.

Sinus tachycardia (ST) is ubiquitous, but its presence outside of normal physiological triggers in otherwise healthy individuals remains a commonly encountered phenomenon in medical practice. In many cases, ST can be readily explained by a medical condition that precipitates an increase in the sinus rate, but ST at rest without physiological triggers may also represent a spectrum of normal. In other cases, ST may not have an easily explainable cause but may represent serious underlying pathology and can be associated with intolerable symptoms.

- **Classification and etiologies**: ST can be classified as secondary to a specific, usually treatable, medical condition (e.g. pulmonary embolism, anemia, infection, or hyperthyroidism) or be related to several incompletely defined conditions (e.g. inappropriate ST, postural tachycardia syndrome, mast cell disorder, or post-COVID syndrome).

- **Challenges in management**: While cardiologists and cardiac electrophysiologists often evaluate patients with symptoms associated with persistent or paroxysmal ST, an optimal approach remains uncertain. Due to the many possible conditions associated with ST, and an overlap in medical specialists who see these patients, the inclusion of experts in different fields is essential for a more comprehensive understanding.

This article is unique in that it was composed by international experts in neurology, psychology, autonomic medicine, allergy and immunology, exercise physiology, pulmonology, and critical care medicine.

### Rapid loading of sotalol or amiodarone for management of recent onset symptomatic atrial fibrillation: a randomized, digoxin-controlled trial [^1178XVrt]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Amiodarone and sotalol are commonly used for the maintenance of sinus rhythm, but the efficacy of these agents administered as high-dose infusions for rapid conversion of atrial fibrillation is unknown. Their use in this context would facilitate drug initiation in patients for whom ongoing prophylactic therapy is indicated.

- **Methods**: We assessed the efficacy and safety of rapid high-dose intravenous infusions of amiodarone and sotalol for heart rate control and rapid reversion to sinus rhythm in patients who presented to the emergency department with recent-onset symptomatic atrial fibrillation. Patients (n = 140) were randomized to receive 1.5 mg/kg of sotalol infused in 10 minutes, 10 mg/kg of amiodarone in 30 minutes, or 500 micrograms of digoxin in 20 minutes. Electrical cardioversion was attempted for patients not converting to sinus rhythm within 12 hours.

- **Results**: The rapid infusion of sotalol or amiodarone resulted in more rapid rate control than digoxin. Each of the three trial strategies resulted in similar rates of pharmacological conversion to sinus rhythm (amiodarone, 51%; sotalol, 44%; digoxin, 50%; P = not significant). The overall rates of cardioversion after trial drug infusion and defibrillation were high for all groups (amiodarone, 94%; sotalol, 95%; digoxin, 98%; P = not significant), but there was a trend toward a higher incidence of serious adverse reactions in the amiodarone group.

- **Conclusion**: The rapid infusion of sotalol or amiodarone in patients with symptomatic recent-onset atrial fibrillation results in rapid control of the ventricular rate.

### New antiarrhythmic drugs for establishing sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation: What are our therapies likely to be by 2010 and beyond [^114g5nAL]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

The management of atrial fibrillation (AF) is challenged by several factors, including the limitations in the efficacy, tolerance, and safety of currently available agents for the conversion of AF to sinus rhythm and for the maintenance of sinus rhythm. This review describes some of the most promising approaches to new therapies that may overcome these limitations. The agents we have chosen to review are representative of these new approaches and have either completed their phase III trials and submitted an application for approval by regulatory agencies or are nearing the completion of their phase III trials and appear likely to submit for approval in the near future.

### Deciphering the sinus tachycardias [^116Rsxx4]. Clinical Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Sinus tachycardia is the most common rhythm disturbance encountered in clinical practice. Primary sinus tachycardia without an underlying secondary cause, despite often being associated with troublesome symptoms, is often neglected, leading to multiple consultations and frustration for both the practitioner and the patient. The fact that primary sinus tachycardias are a heterogeneous group of disorders is seldom appreciated, hence a firm diagnosis is rarely reached and management is haphazard. Furthermore, there may be prognostic implications for prolonged or recurrent sinus tachycardia, making it imperative that this group of arrhythmias receive adequate and appropriate attention. Normal sinus tachycardia (i.e. secondary), inappropriate sinus tachycardia, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), and sinus node reentry tachycardia make up this group of arrhythmias. Their definitions, clinical features, diagnostic criteria, pathophysiologic mechanisms, and optimum management are discussed in this review.

### Ataxia caused by amiodarone in older people [^112KuMCR]. Age and Ageing (2008). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is recommended for the cardioversion of atrial fibrillation and prevention of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with structural heart disease, coronary artery disease, or left ventricular dysfunction. It has well-recognized side effects on the skin, lungs, liver, thyroid, and eyes. Neurological side effects, including ataxia and neuropathy, also occur, and may be more prevalent in older patients. These side effects are reversible after cessation of amiodarone. Monitoring of amiodarone therapy should include assessment of the central and peripheral nervous systems, especially in older patients.

### Comparing intravenous amiodarone or lidocaine, or both, outcomes for inpatients with pulseless ventricular arrhythmias [^116kECFr]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the survival rates of patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest due to pulseless ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation who were treated with lidocaine, amiodarone, or a combination of both. The design was a multicenter retrospective medical record review conducted in three academic medical centers in the United States.

The study focused on hospitalized adult patients who received amiodarone, lidocaine, or a combination for pulseless ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation between August 1, 2000, and July 31, 2002. Data were collected according to the Utstein style.

- **Measurements and main results**: In-hospital survival proportions at 24 hours and discharge were analyzed using chi-square analysis. Of the 605 patient medical records reviewed, 194 met the criteria for inclusion: 79 for lidocaine, 74 for amiodarone, and 41 for the combination. Available data showed no difference in the proportion of patients alive 24 hours post-cardiac arrest (p = .39). Cox regression analysis indicated a decreased likelihood of survival in patients with pulseless ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation as an initial rhythm compared with those who presented with bradycardia followed by pulseless ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Additionally, patients who received amiodarone compared to lidocaine also had a decreased likelihood of survival. Notably, only 14 patients (25%) in the amiodarone group received the recommended initial 300-mg intravenous bolus, and amiodarone was administered an average of 8 minutes later in the code compared to lidocaine (p < 0.001).

In conclusion, these results suggest potential differences in survival outcomes based on treatment protocol, although further research is needed for more definitive conclusions.

### Amiodarone after surgical ablation for atrial fibrillation: Is it really necessary? A prospective randomized controlled trial [^11142CQA]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2016). High credibility.

Prophylactic antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) treatment is a well-established practice after catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF), but it is controversial after surgical ablation. This prospective randomized controlled trial examined whether amiodarone after surgical ablation reduced atrial arrhythmia recurrence within the first 3 months after surgery.

- **Methods**: Ninety patients were randomized to receive (n = 45) or not receive (n = 45) amiodarone after surgical ablation. Rhythm status was ascertained via clinical follow-up and 72-hour continuous monitoring at 6 and 12 weeks, using Heart Rhythm Society guidelines. The primary outcome was defined as atrial arrhythmia recurrence, cardioversion, ablation, or crossover from no-amiodarone to amiodarone as a result of atrial arrhythmia during follow-up. An intention-to-treat approach was used.

- **Results**: The two study groups were similar in traditional predictors for failure, including left atrium size (5.0 vs 5.1 cm, P = 0.734), median AF duration (23 vs 20 months, P = 0.513), and long-standing persistent AF (44% vs 33%, P = 0.280). The primary outcome occurred in 52% of the no-amiodarone group (23 of 44) and 19% of the amiodarone group (8 of 43; p = 0.001). Cumulative freedom from the primary outcome was greater in the amiodarone group (81.4% vs 47.7%, P < .001). Amiodarone was discontinued in 18 patients randomized to amiodarone for side effects, bradycardia, or noncompliance.

- **Conclusions**: Prophylactic amiodarone reduced early atrial arrhythmia recurrence. These results are consistent with catheter AF ablation findings and show the potential benefit of amiodarone in similar settings.

### The sinus tachycardias [^117FrYK9]. Nature Clinical Practice. Cardiovascular Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Sinus tachycardia, in the forms of four distinct rhythm disturbances, is frequently encountered in clinical practice but is often overlooked. The most common rhythm, normal sinus tachycardia, whether physiologic, pathologic, or iatrogenic, is predominantly catecholamine-driven, is virtually asymptomatic, and is managed by identifying and treating the underlying cause. The other so-called primary sinus tachycardias, which include inappropriate sinus tachycardia, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, and sinus node re-entry tachycardia, have fundamentally different clinical features, basic underlying etiologic mechanisms, and treatment strategies. Differentiation of these types from normal sinus tachycardia and from other atrial arrhythmias is crucial for successful management. Accurate diagnosis and appropriate therapy of the sinus tachycardias not only prevents multiple consultations but might also have important long-term prognostic implications.

### Inappropriate sinus tachycardia-symptom and heart rate reduction with ivabradine: A pooled analysis of prospective studies [^117R5VHc]. Heart Rhythm (2018). Low credibility.

Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is debilitating despite available treatment. The off-label use of ivabradine for IST prompted this systematic analysis of existing data quality and sample size estimates for adequately powered studies.

- **Objective**: To determine the clinical efficacy of ivabradine in IST from pooled prospective studies.

- **Methods**: The analysis included ivabradine studies for IST participants without structural heart disease and with follow-up of ≥ 2 weeks. Heart rate and symptom reduction with ivabradine were estimated based on results of subjective change in symptoms assessed by various data instruments used in each study. Studies were assessed for quality using validated checklists. Sample sizes were calculated based on the magnitude of symptom reduction encountered after treatment with ivabradine.

- **Results**: Nine studies met the criteria, culminating in 145 patients pooled. Most patients were women (≥ 70%). Studies were small and not adequately powered, and all reported a decrease in maximum or mean resting heart rate or both, with complete or considerable amelioration of symptoms with ivabradine. Most studies had moderate quality with excellent consistency of study quality and narrow limits of agreement between the quality checklists. Sample size estimates for adequately powered studies with various placebo effects and comparisons with β-blockade are reported.

- **Conclusions**: Ivabradine effectively reduces heart rate and symptoms in IST, but no study was adequately powered to account for the expected placebo effect on symptoms. A multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study is necessary to confirm these findings.

### A comparison of rate control and rhythm control in patients with recurrent persistent atrial fibrillation [^115izmTN]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Maintenance of sinus rhythm is the main therapeutic goal in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, recurrences of atrial fibrillation and side effects of antiarrhythmic drugs offset the benefits of sinus rhythm. We hypothesized that ventricular rate control is not inferior to the maintenance of sinus rhythm for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned 522 patients who had persistent atrial fibrillation following a previous electrical cardioversion to receive treatment aimed at rate control or rhythm control. Patients in the rate-control group received oral anticoagulant drugs and rate-slowing medication. Patients in the rhythm-control group underwent serial cardioversions and received antiarrhythmic drugs and oral anticoagulant drugs. The endpoint was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, heart failure, thromboembolic complications, bleeding, implantation of a pacemaker, and severe adverse effects of drugs.

- **Results**: After a mean (± SD) of 2.3 ± 0.6 years, 39 percent of the 266 patients in the rhythm-control group had sinus rhythm, as compared with 10 percent of the 256 patients in the rate-control group. The primary endpoint occurred in 44 patients (17.2 percent) in the rate-control group and in 60 (22.6 percent) in the rhythm-control group. The 90 percent (two-sided) upper boundary of the absolute difference in the primary endpoint was 0.4 percent (the prespecified criterion for noninferiority was 10 percent or less). The distribution of the various components of the primary endpoint was similar in the rate-control group and the rhythm-control group.

### Atrial fibrillation in heart failure: What should we do [^116yVuPg]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Although sub-group data suggest that sinus rhythm is associated with improved outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), including all-cause survival, clinical trials have failed to demonstrate superiority of either a rate or rhythm-control strategy. For example, in the AF-CHF trial, there was no difference in cardiovascular (CV) death when comparing a rate vs. rhythm-control strategy in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes II–IV (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.86–1.30, P = 0.59), with similar findings for all-cause mortality and worsening heart failure (HF).

There are several reasons that rhythm control has failed to improve survival in clinical trials, including limited efficacy and adverse effects of available treatments, or delayed intervention such that the cumulative effects of AF are already unable to be reversed. Sinus rhythm can be difficult to achieve and maintain, particularly in patients with HF. In the rhythm control arm of AF-CHF, 21% crossed over to rate control, 82% were taking amiodarone, 27% were in AF at 4-year follow-up, and 58% had at least one episode of AF during the trial.

On the other hand, in studies of catheter ablation of AF, restoration of sinus rhythm is associated with significant improvement in left ventricular function, with an 11% increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on average. While there are no clear differences in CV outcomes, patients with AF and HF who spend a higher proportion of time in sinus rhythm suffer less severe functional impairment, with NYHA class III symptoms in 27% compared to 35% (P < 0.0001). Based on these and other data, guidelines reserve rhythm-control therapy for select cases.

### Baroreflex sensitivity in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112bVzzz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Unexpectedly, the baseline value of baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) in patients treated with amiodarone tended to be greater than in those without, because it is well known that amiodarone reduces the sinus rate, which could result in underestimation of BRS. Our findings appeared to be consistent with a recent report that demonstrated amiodarone could have the potential to improve cardiac autonomic function. The comparison of patients with and without amiodarone is limited in number and may not represent the entire population.

### Amiodarone and the thyroid [^114nAseZ]. Endocrine Practice (2004). High credibility.

Amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders can be associated with several symptoms and conditions. These include anxiety, tachycardia, increased appetite, constipation, anorexia, and weight loss. Other manifestations are elevated serum free T3, nervousness, ventricular arrhythmia, sweating, fatigue, confusion, tremor, and heat intolerance. Furthermore, patients may experience goiter, Graves' disease, increased serum free T4, increased serum TSH, atrial fibrillation (AF), and hyperreflexia.

### Verapamil hydrochloride [^117XvvXV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Verapamil Hydrochloride Injection, USP, is indicated for:

- **Rapid conversion to sinus rhythm**: This is applicable for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias, including those associated with accessory bypass tracts, such as Wolff-Parkinson-White (W-P-W) and Lown-Ganong-Levine (L-G-L) syndromes. When clinically advisable, appropriate vagal maneuvers, like the Valsalva maneuver, should be attempted prior to administering verapamil hydrochloride.

- **Temporary control of rapid ventricular rate**: This is relevant for atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation, except when they are associated with accessory bypass tracts, such as W-P-W and L-G-L syndromes.

In controlled studies conducted in the United States, approximately 60% of patients with supraventricular tachycardia converted to normal sinus rhythm within 10 minutes after intravenous administration of verapamil hydrochloride. Uncontrolled studies reported in global literature describe a conversion rate of about 80%. Approximately 70% of patients with atrial flutter and/or fibrillation with a faster ventricular rate respond with a decrease in ventricular rate of at least 20%.

Conversion of atrial flutter or fibrillation to sinus rhythm is uncommon (about 10%) after verapamil hydrochloride and may reflect the spontaneous conversion rate, as the conversion rate after placebo was similar. Slowing of the ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation/flutter lasts 30 to 60 minutes following a single injection.

### Effect of amiodarone and hypothermia on arrhythmia substrates during resuscitation [^115uMmho]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Our data, both ex vivo and in vivo, suggest that despite promoting and ameliorating individual arrhythmia substrates, the overall effect of amiodarone is not proarrhythmic over the range of temperatures used in targeted temperature management (TTM).

Clinically and mechanistically, the effects of amiodarone are divided into chronic use and acute intravenous (IV) administration. Acute administration generally produces more conduction delay and less post-repolarization refractoriness than chronic administration. During conduction, amiodarone affects I_Na and L-type calcium channels, causing conduction slowing. During repolarization, amiodarone has mixed effects on potassium currents, including I_Kr, I_Ks, I_To, and I_K, ATP, which explains the minimal effect on dispersion of repolarization (DOR) under normal conditions.

### Fetal supraventricular tachycardia: A role for amiodarone as second-line therapy [^116cBf4b]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2003). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of amiodarone for the prenatal treatment of hydropic fetuses with supraventricular tachycardia.

- **Methods**: A group of 26 hydropic fetuses with supraventricular tachycardia was studied retrospectively.

- **Results**: Twenty-five fetuses received transplacental treatment. The overall prenatal conversion rate was 60%. Nine fetuses were converted to sinus rhythm using either flecainide (n = 7) or amiodarone (n = 2) as first-line therapy, whilst digoxin alone or in association with sotalol failed to restore sinus rhythm in all cases. After first-line therapy, supraventricular tachycardia persisted in 10 fetuses. Nine fetuses received amiodarone alone or in association with digoxin as second-line therapy, five of whom were converted to sinus rhythm. Among the 11 live neonates treated by amiodarone in utero, two (17%) presented with elevated thyroid stimulating hormone levels on day 3–4. These two infants received thyroid hormone substitution therapy and had a normal outcome.

- **Conclusion**: When first-line therapy fails to restore sinus rhythm in hydropic fetuses with supraventricular tachycardia, amiodarone therapy should be considered as it allows a substantial number of fetuses to be converted prenatally.

### Effect of reducing heart rate on outcomes in patients with reduced ejection fraction [^113s1BUa]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Since 1953, sinus tachycardia has been defined as a heart rate (HR) in sinus rhythm of over 100 beats per minute (bpm). However, this number has never been formally evaluated, and there are no established threshold values for specific groups, such as those with heart failure (HF) accompanied by a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). We provide evidence that lowering the HR of patients with HFrEF to below 70 bpm with medications such as ivabradine improves outcomes. Numerous large-scale trials and smaller clinical studies have shown that reducing the HR in patients with HFrEF improves cardiovascular and overall outcomes. Evidence suggests that an HR of less than 70 bpm is appropriate for patients with HFrEF. Examination of HF registries indicates that in a large proportion of these patients, the HR exceeds 80 bpm, and no consideration is given to lowering the HR due to a lack of physician awareness of the benefits of a lower HR. Evidence indicates that the first-line medication for lowering HR in patients with HFrEF is ivabradine. In conclusion, the improved prognosis following appropriate HR management in patients with HFrEF suggests that the cut-off value for sinus tachycardia in these patients should be redefined as 75 bpm. Maintaining an HR of less than 70 bpm in patients with HFrEF is associated with improved cardiovascular and overall outcomes.

### Conversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation or flutter with ibutilide after amiodarone has failed [^111aWExj]. Intensive Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

To evaluate whether ibutilide can convert atrial fibrillation or flutter in patients in whom amiodarone has failed, a clinical study was conducted in a university hospital intensive care unit (ICU).

Twenty-six patients were studied, in whom atrial fibrillation or flutter persisted for a maximum of 6 hours. Patients were monitored continuously during the arrhythmia, and medical conversion was necessary due to symptomatic or hemodynamic causes.

- **Interventions**: All patients initially received amiodarone (150 mg i.v.). After 2 hours of persistent arrhythmia, ibutilide (1 mg or, if unsuccessful and with body weight > 70 kg, 2 mg i.v.) was administered. Before the administration of ibutilide, 1 g of magnesium was given, and high normal potassium serum levels were achieved (4.5–5.0 mmol/l).

- **Results**: After amiodarone, atrial flutter persisted in 73% and atrial fibrillation in 27% of patients. After administering ibutilide, the QT interval was prolonged from 327 ± 61 to 387 ± 62 ms and the QTc interval from 456 ± 32 to 461 ± 66 ms. Conversion to normal sinus rhythm was achieved in 22 of 27 cases. Nonsustained torsade de pointes tachycardia was seen in three patients (11%). No patient showed sustained ventricular tachycardia. Patients with proarrhythmic effects were characterized by decreased left ventricular function.

In conclusion, in ICU patients, ibutilide led to conversion to sinus rhythm in 81.5% of patients in whom amiodarone was unsuccessful. Nonsustained tachycardias were seen in 11% of cases, and sustained ventricular tachycardia was not observed.

### Amiodarone versus other pharmacological interventions for prevention of sudden cardiac death [^115pVYF4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is one of the main causes of cardiac death. There are two main strategies to prevent it: managing cardiovascular risk factors and reducing the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) constitute the standard therapy for both primary and secondary prevention; however, they are not widely available in settings with limited resources. The antiarrhythmic amiodarone has been proposed as an alternative to ICD.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness of amiodarone for primary or secondary prevention in SCD compared with placebo, no intervention, or any other antiarrhythmic drugs in participants at high risk (primary prevention) or who have recovered from a cardiac arrest or syncope due to ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF), or VT/VF (secondary prevention).

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE (OVID), CINAHL (EBSCO), and LILACS on 26 March 2015. We reviewed reference lists of included studies and selected reviews on the topic, contacted authors of included studies, screened relevant meetings, and searched in registers for ongoing trials. We applied no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials assessing the efficacy of amiodarone versus placebo, no intervention, or other antiarrhythmics in adults. For primary prevention, we considered participants at high risk for SCD. For secondary prevention, we considered participants recovered from cardiac arrest or syncope due to ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation.

### Effect of amiodarone and hypothermia on arrhythmia substrates during resuscitation [^1176EDwQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

- **Effect of amiodarone on conduction block and inducible arrhythmias with temperature**: At 36°C, amiodarone did not prevent conduction block (36‐Alone = 6/7, 36‐Amio = 5/8) and did not worsen arrhythmia susceptibility (36‐Alone = 3/5, 36‐Amio = 3/8), with one 36‐Alone experiment not undergoing PES. At 32°C, the combination of CV slowing and worsening of DOR with amiodarone did not promote transmural conduction block (32‐Alone = 0/7, 32‐Amio = 0/8) and did not affect arrhythmias susceptibility (32‐Alone = 1/4, 32‐Amio = 0/8), with three 32‐Alone experiments not undergoing PES.

Figure 6A shows an arrhythmia induced by PES at 36°C during ischemia with amiodarone. The top panel displays the ECG and action potentials from three sites, while the bottom panel shows activation time (upper) and corresponding repolarization time (lower) maps for each beat during VF initiation. Extra endocardial beats led to conduction block (site C, upper panel, red block symbol and S3 activation map, red bar) and reentrant excitation originating from site C (arrows and first beat of VF). Block and reentry occurred at the site of maximal RG on the previous beat (S2 repolarization time map, site C). VF initiation (upper panels and VF map) occurs via a reentrant mechanism.

Figure 6B shows significant conduction slowing with amiodarone at 32°C (isochrones crowding on all activation maps); however, no arrhythmia was induced. This lack of arrhythmia induction can be attributed to the amelioration of RG, which prevented conduction block in the presence of TH, thus ensuring CV slowing did not increase susceptibility to arrhythmias.

### Amiodarone and thyroid physiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and management [^1113fAZY]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Although amiodarone is considered the most effective antiarrhythmic agent, its use is limited by a wide variety of potential toxicities. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive "bench to bedside" overview of the ways amiodarone influences thyroid function. We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE to identify peer-reviewed clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and other clinically relevant studies. The search was limited to English-language reports published between 1950 and 2017. Amiodarone was searched using the terms adverse effects, hypothyroidism, myxedema, hyperthyroidism, thyroid storm, atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmia, and electrical storm. Google and Google Scholar, as well as bibliographies of identified articles, were reviewed for additional references. We included 163 germane references in this review. Because amiodarone is one of the most frequently prescribed antiarrhythmic drugs in the United States, the mechanistic, diagnostic, and therapeutic information provided is relevant for practicing clinicians in a wide range of medical specialties.

### Amiodarone use and all-cause mortality in patients with a continuous-flow left ventricular assist device [^111iKmJx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Another important finding in our study is that a quarter (27%) of patients in the amiodarone group had pre-LVAD atrial arrhythmias (AAs) only, with no documented ventricular arrhythmias (VAs). Management of AAs, such as atrial fibrillation, in patients with heart failure (HF) is limited by antiarrhythmic medication options, often necessitating the use of amiodarone. Catheter ablation outcomes present an appealing alternative in these patients to avoid long-term amiodarone use. Over the past few years, multiple studies, including large randomized trials, have demonstrated a significant beneficial effect of rhythm control with catheter ablation compared with antiarrhythmic drugs, especially in patients with HF.

In the CASTLE-AF (Catheter Ablation versus Standard Conventional Therapy in Patients with Left Ventricular Dysfunction and Atrial Fibrillation) trial, patients with HF and left ventricular ejection fraction < 35% were randomized to catheter ablation versus antiarrhythmic drugs for management of atrial fibrillation. Patients randomized to catheter ablation had a 38% overall reduction in the primary outcome of death or HF hospitalization. In a subanalysis, this benefit did not meet statistical significance in patients on amiodarone. Similar results of improved overall outcomes with catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation in patients with HF have also been shown in the CABANA (Catheter Ablation versus Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation) trial. Given these data and our findings of worse long-term outcomes with amiodarone use, early catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation in patients with advanced HF being considered for an LVAD implant may be warranted.

### Tikosyn [^115ieQxL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Tikosyn is indicated for the maintenance of normal sinus rhythm, specifically the delay in the time to recurrence of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter (AF/AFl), in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter lasting more than one week who have been converted to normal sinus rhythm. Due to the risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, Tikosyn should be reserved for patients in whom atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter is highly symptomatic.

In general, antiarrhythmic therapy for atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter aims to prolong the time in normal sinus rhythm; however, recurrence is expected in some patients (see clinical studies).

Tikosyn is also indicated for the conversion of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter to normal sinus rhythm. It is important to note that Tikosyn has not been shown to be effective in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

### Pacerone [^113fHQnJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. At the usual maintenance dose (400 mg/day) and above, amiodarone hydrochloride causes adverse reactions in about three-fourths of all patients, resulting in discontinuation in 7% to 18%.

In surveys of almost 5,000 patients treated in open U.S. studies and in published reports of treatment with amiodarone hydrochloride, the adverse reactions most frequently requiring discontinuation of amiodarone hydrochloride included pulmonary infiltrates or fibrosis, paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia, congestive heart failure, and elevation of liver enzymes. Other symptoms causing discontinuations less often included visual disturbances, photosensitivity, blue skin discoloration, hyperthyroidism, and hypothyroidism.

The following side-effect rates are based on a retrospective study of 241 patients treated for 2 to 1,515 days (mean 441.3 days):

- **Thyroid**:
	- **Common**: Hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism.

- **Cardiovascular**:
	- **Common**: Congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, SA node dysfunction.

- **Gastrointestinal**:
	- **Very common**: Nausea, vomiting.
	- **Common**: Constipation, anorexia, abdominal pain.

- **Dermatologic**:
	- **Common**: Solar dermatitis/photosensitivity.

- **Neurologic**:
	- **Common**: Malaise and fatigue, tremor/abnormal involuntary movements, lack of coordination, abnormal gait/ataxia, dizziness, paresthesias.

### Practical management guide for clinicians who treat patients with amiodarone [^115ZRH51]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Amiodarone, an iodinated benzofuran derivative with Class I, II, III, and IV antiarrhythmic properties, is the most commonly used antiarrhythmic drug used to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. The appropriate use of this drug, with its severe and potentially life-threatening adverse effects, requires an essential understanding of its risk-benefit properties to ensure safety. The objective of this review is to provide clinicians who treat patients receiving amiodarone with an appropriate management strategy for its safe use.

The authors of this consensus management guide have thoroughly reviewed and evaluated the existing literature on amiodarone and applied this information, along with their collective experience, in its development.

- **Management guides include**:
	- Intravenous and oral dosing of amiodarone
	- Appropriate outpatient follow-up of patients taking the drug
	- Recognized adverse effects
	- Recommendations on when to consult specialists to assist in patient management

All clinicians must be cognizant of the appropriate use, follow-up, and adverse reactions of amiodarone. The responsibility incurred by those treating such patients cannot be overemphasized.

### Clinical efficacy of ivabradine in patients with inappropriate sinus tachycardia: a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover evaluation [^116X3u4t]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of ivabradine in the treatment of symptomatic inappropriate sinus tachycardia using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design.

Due to its I(f) blocking properties, ivabradine can selectively attenuate the high discharge rate from sinus node cells, causing inappropriate sinus tachycardia.

Twenty-one patients were randomized to receive placebo (n = 10) or ivabradine 5 mg twice daily (n = 11) for 6 weeks. After a washout period, patients crossed over for an additional 6 weeks. Each patient underwent symptom evaluation and heart rate assessment at the start and finish of each phase.

After taking ivabradine, patients reported elimination of > 70% of symptoms (relative risk: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.34; p < 0.001), with 47% of them experiencing complete elimination. These effects were associated with a significant reduction of heart rate at rest (from 88 ± 11 beats/min to 76 ± 11 beats/min, p = 0.011), on standing (from 108 ± 12 beats/min to 92 ± 11 beats/min, p < 0.0001), during 24 h (from 88 ± 5 beats/min to 77 ± 9 beats/min, p = 0.001), and during effort (from 176 ± 17 beats/min to 158 ± 16 beats/min, p = 0.001). Ivabradine administration was also associated with a significant increase in exercise performance. No cardiovascular side effects were observed in any patients while taking ivabradine.

In this cohort, ivabradine significantly improved symptoms associated with inappropriate sinus tachycardia and completely eliminated them in approximately half of the patients.
