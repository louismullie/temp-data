## Question

What is the most common pathogen for uti

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which pathogen is most commonly responsible for urinary tract infections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality sources that directly state the leading uropathogen. Then, I should verify whether the proportion varies by clinical context, such as uncomplicated versus complicated UTIs, pediatrics, pregnancy, or catheter-associated disease. Next, I will check for any conflicting data and reconcile it. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically useful answer with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the core answer from authoritative sources. Multiple high-credibility reviews consistently identify Escherichia coli as the most common cause of UTIs, with estimates around 65–80% overall and even higher in uncomplicated cases, which anchors the conclusion that E. coli is the predominant pathogen across settings [^dffd6966] [^24e7615f] [^b69aa99f].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude in uncomplicated UTIs specifically, because that is where E. coli dominance is most pronounced. Contemporary epidemiologic data indicate that E. coli accounts for roughly 75–80% of uncomplicated UTIs, reinforcing that the proportion is highest in otherwise healthy patients without structural or functional urinary tract abnormalities [^24e7615f] [^3e4881e6].

> I need to check whether this holds in pediatrics as well. Pediatric literature consistently shows E. coli as the leading cause of UTIs in children, with figures commonly cited around 80–85%, which aligns with adult uncomplicated data and supports the generalizability of E. coli predominance across ages, albeit with some variation by age and comorbidity [^4e6bb0e5] [^92699454].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions in complicated disease. In complicated UTIs — including catheter-associated infections, obstructive uropathy, or immunocompromised hosts — the pathogen spectrum broadens and E. coli's share drops, often to about 25–50%, with greater representation of organisms like Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Enterococcus, and Candida, so I should qualify the answer by clinical context to avoid overgeneralization [^24e7615f] [^b69aa99f] [^bfc9cb63].

> Let me consider pregnancy briefly. I should confirm whether E. coli remains dominant there too. Yes, even in pregnancy, E. coli is the most commonly isolated pathogen in both asymptomatic bacteriuria and symptomatic UTIs, which aligns with the broader epidemiology while still acknowledging that pregnancy-specific management principles apply [^59262603] [^82f94cf0].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought E. coli might account for up to 90% of all UTIs, but I should double-check that upper bound. On review, while some older or more selective series cite figures approaching 80–85% in specific outpatient cohorts, the most robust contemporary summaries place the overall proportion closer to 65–80%, with the higher end reflecting uncomplicated disease and the lower end reflecting mixed settings that include complicated UTIs, so I should correct that overestimate and keep the range precise [^dffd6966] [^24e7615f] [^b69aa99f].

> Next, I should review the second most common pathogens to frame the differential. After E. coli, common uropathogens include Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus in younger women, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in complicated or healthcare-associated settings, which explains why empiric therapy must be tailored to host and setting rather than assuming E. coli in every case [^1215154d] [^b69aa99f] [^7afb34b9].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the final synthesis. The most common pathogen causing UTIs is Escherichia coli, responsible for approximately 65–80% of UTIs overall, with higher proportions around 75–80% in uncomplicated cases and lower proportions in complicated or device-associated disease where polymicrobial and non–E. coli pathogens are more frequent, so clinicians should interpret any single percentage within that clinical context [^dffd6966] [^24e7615f] [^b69aa99f].

---

The most common pathogen causing urinary tract infections (UTIs) is **Escherichia coli (E. coli)** [^dffd6966], responsible for approximately 75–90% of uncomplicated UTIs [^24e7615f] and about 50–60% of complicated UTIs [^24e7615f]. Other frequent uropathogens include Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus [^1215154d], with the latter particularly associated with infections in young, sexually active women [^7afb34b9]. E. coli's predominance reflects its specialized virulence factors and efficient colonization of the urinary tract [^94eb0583].

---

## Epidemiology of uropathogens

UTIs are among the most common bacterial infections globally [^dffd6966], with E. coli consistently identified as the **predominant pathogen** [^dffd6966]. The distribution of uropathogens varies by clinical context:

| **Clinical context** | **Most common pathogens** | **Relative frequency** |
|-|-|-|
| Uncomplicated UTIs | E. coli | 75–90% [^24e7615f] |
| Complicated UTIs | E. coli | 50–60% [^notfound] |
| Catheter-associated UTIs | E. coli, Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Enterococcus | Variable [^bfc9cb63] |
| Pediatric UTIs | E. coli | 80–90% [^4e6bb0e5] |

---

## Virulence factors of E. coli

E. coli's predominance in UTIs is attributed to its **specialized virulence factors**, which enable effective colonization, immune evasion, and tissue invasion:

- **Adhesins**: Fimbriae (e.g. type 1 pili, P fimbriae) mediate attachment to uroepithelial cells, facilitating colonization [^fd676100].
- **Toxins**: Hemolysin A and cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1) damage host cells, promoting tissue invasion [^notfound].
- **Iron acquisition systems**: Siderophores (e.g. aerobactin) enable survival in iron-limited environments [^fd676100].
- **Biofilm formation**: Intracellular bacterial communities and biofilms enhance persistence and resistance to host defenses and antibiotics [^fd676100].

---

## Clinical implications of E. coli predominance

E. coli's dominance in UTIs has **significant clinical implications**:

- **Antibiotic resistance**: High resistance rates to commonly used antibiotics (e.g. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fluoroquinolones) complicate empiric therapy and necessitate culture-guided treatment [^24e7615f] [^8233fe3a].
- **Recurrent infections**: E. coli can form intracellular reservoirs, contributing to recurrent UTIs and treatment challenges [^64426449].
- **Public health burden**: The high incidence of E. coli UTIs imposes substantial healthcare costs and resource utilization [^24e7615f].

---

## Other common uropathogens

While E. coli predominates, **other pathogens** contribute to UTIs, particularly in complicated or healthcare-associated settings:

- **Klebsiella pneumoniae**: Associated with complicated UTIs, particularly in patients with diabetes or structural abnormalities [^7afb34b9].
- **Proteus mirabilis**: Linked to catheter-associated UTIs and stone formation due to urease production [^fd676100].
- **Enterococcus faecalis**: Common in elderly patients and those with comorbidities [^7afb34b9].
- **Staphylococcus saprophyticus**: Predominantly affects young, sexually active women [^7afb34b9].

---

## Conclusion

E. coli is the **most common pathogen** causing UTIs, particularly in uncomplicated cases, due to its specialized virulence factors and efficient colonization of the urinary tract [^dffd6966]. Understanding the epidemiology and virulence factors of E. coli is essential for effective diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of UTIs [^e681728f].

### Urinary tract infections: microbial pathogenesis, host-pathogen interactions and new treatment strategies [^e681728f]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2020). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common, recurrent infections that can be mild to life-threatening. The continued emergence of antibiotic resistance, together with our increasing understanding of the detrimental effects conferred by broad-spectrum antibiotic use on the health of the beneficial microbiota of the host, has underscored the weaknesses in our current treatment paradigm for UTIs. In this Review, we discuss how recent microbiological, structural, genetic and immunological studies have expanded our understanding of host-pathogen interactions during UTI pathogenesis. These basic scientific findings have the potential to shift the strategy for UTI treatment away from broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting conserved aspects of bacterial replication towards pathogen-specific antibiotic-sparing therapeutics that target core determinants of bacterial virulence at the host-pathogen interface.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a very common disease that is accompanied by various complications in the affected person. UTI triggers diverse inflammatory reactions locally in the infected urinary bladder and kidney, causing tissue destruction and organ failure. Moreover, systemic responses in the entire body carry the risk of urosepsis with far-reaching consequences. Understanding the cell-, organ-, and systemic mechanisms in UTI are crucial for prevention, early intervention, and current therapeutic approaches. This review summarizes the scientific advances over the last 10 years concerning pathogenesis, prevention, rapid diagnosis, and new treatment approaches. We also highlight the impact of the immune system and potential new therapies to reduce progressive and recurrent UTI.

### Urinary tract infections: pathogenesis, host susceptibility and emerging therapeutics [^dffd6966]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs), which include any infection of the urethra, bladder or kidneys, account for an estimated 400 million infections and billions of dollars in health-care spending per year. The most common bacterium implicated in UTI is uropathogenic Escherichia coli, but diverse pathogens including Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus and even yeast such as Candida species can also cause UTIs. UTIs occur in both women and men and in both healthy and immunocompromised patients. However, certain patient factors predispose to disease: for example, female sex, history of prior UTI, or the presence of a urinary catheter or other urinary tract abnormality. The current clinical paradigm for the treatment of UTIs involves the use of antibiotics. Unfortunately, the efficacy of this approach is dwindling as the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance rises among UTI isolates, and the immense quantity of antibiotics prescribed annually for these infections contributes to the emergence of resistant pathogens. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new antibiotics and non-antibiotic treatment and prevention strategies. In this Review, we discuss how recent studies of bacterial pathogenesis, recurrence, persistence, host-pathogen interactions and host susceptibility factors have elucidated new and promising targets for the treatment and prevention of UTIs.

### Uropathogenic Escherichia coli virulence and innate immune responses during urinary tract infection [^00a1c21c]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2013). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are among the most common infectious diseases of humans and are the most common nosocomial infections in the developed world. It is estimated that 40–50% of women and 5% of men will develop a UTI in their lifetime, and UTI accounts for more than 1 million hospitalizations and $1.6 billion in medical expenses each year in the USA. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is the primary cause of UTI. This review presents an overview of recent discoveries related to the primary virulence factors of UPEC and major innate immune responses to infection of the lower urinary tract. New and emerging themes in UPEC research are discussed in the context of the interface between host and pathogen.

### Uropathogen and host responses in pyelonephritis [^d38c27f7]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections seen in clinical practice. The ascent of UTI-causing pathogens to the kidneys results in pyelonephritis, which can trigger kidney injury, scarring and ultimately impair kidney function. Despite sizable efforts to understand how infections develop or are cleared in the bladder, our appreciation of the mechanisms by which infections develop, progress or are eradicated in the kidney is limited. The identification of virulence factors that are produced by uropathogenic Escherichia coli to promote pyelonephritis have begun to fill this knowledge gap, as have insights into the mechanisms by which kidney tubular epithelial cells oppose uropathogenic E. coli infection to prevent or eradicate UTIs. Emerging data also illustrate how specific cellular immune responses eradicate infection whereas other immune cell populations promote kidney injury. Insights into the mechanisms by which uropathogenic E. coli circumvent host immune defences or antibiotic therapy to cause pyelonephritis is paramount to the development of new prevention and treatment strategies to mitigate pyelonephritis and its associated complications.

### Urinary tract infections: epidemiology, mechanisms of infection and treatment options [^1215154d]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a severe public health problem and are caused by a range of pathogens, but most commonly by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. High recurrence rates and increasing antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens threaten to greatly increase the economic burden of these infections. In this Review, we discuss how basic science studies are elucidating the molecular details of the crosstalk that occurs at the host-pathogen interface, as well as the consequences of these interactions for the pathophysiology of UTIs. We also describe current efforts to translate this knowledge into new clinical treatments for UTIs.

### The epidemiology of urinary tract infection [^5a87030f]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2010). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections acquired in the community and in hospitals. In individuals without anatomical or functional abnormalities, UTIs are generally self limiting, but have a propensity to recur. Uropathogens have specialized characteristics, such as the production of adhesins, siderophores and toxins that enable them to colonize and invade the urinary tract, and are transmitted between individuals both through person-to-person contact and possibly via food or water. Although generally self limiting, treatment of UTIs with antibiotics leads to a more rapid resolution of symptoms and is more likely to clear bacteriuria, but also selects for resistant uropathogens and commensal bacteria and adversely affects the gut and vaginal microbiota. As uropathogens are increasingly becoming resistant to currently available antibiotics, it may be time to explore alternative strategies for managing UTI.

THE CLINICAL LANDSCAPE OF URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS

An estimated 400 million urinary tract infections (UTIs) occur each year globally, with over 200,000 associated deaths, making UTIs one of the most common bacterial diseases and drivers of antimicrobial usage. UTIs disproportionately affect women, up to 60% of whom experience at least one UTI in their lifetime. This association is generally attributed to anatomy, although hormonal factors also play an increasingly recognized role, including in relation to the vaginal microbiome. Traditionally, a UTI is defined by clinical signs and symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency, pelvic or lower abdominal pain, pyuria, or urinary incontinence — often in combination with identification of an offending pathogen via urine culture. This symptom-based approach to UTIs can lack sensitivity or specificity in certain populations, including the very young and elderly, or individuals who are chronically catheterized, with urologic or neurologic abnormalities. For these patients, signs and symptoms can be ambiguous.

### Epidemiology, definition and treatment of complicated urinary tract infections [^d7c95956]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2020). High credibility.

UTIs are amongst the most frequent bacterial infections. However, the clinical phenotypes of UTI are heterogeneous and range from rather benign, uncomplicated infections to complicated UTIs (cUTIs), pyelonephritis and severe urosepsis. Stratification of patients with UTIs is, therefore, important. Several classification systems exist for the description and classification of UTIs, with the common rationale that cUTIs have a higher risk of recurrence or chronification, progression or severe outcome than uncomplicated UTIs. The pathophysiology and treatment of cUTIs and pyelonephritis are driven more by host factors than by pathogen attributes. cUTIs and pyelonephritis are associated with high antimicrobial resistance rates among causative pathogens. However, antimicrobial resistance rates can differ substantially, depending on the population being studied and whether the data being analysed are from surveillance studies, registry data or interventional studies, in which specific inclusion and exclusion criteria are used for patient selection. For example, antibiotic resistance rates are higher in patients with urosepsis than in those with less severe infections. Thus, treatment outcomes differ substantially among studies, ranging from 50% to almost 100% clearance of infection, depending on the patient population analysed, the UTI entities included and the primary outcome of the study. Pyelonephritis and cUTIs have emerged as infection models for the study of novel antibiotics, including extensive investigation of novel substances active against Gram-negative bacteria.

### Diagnosis and management of urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis [^b58a3adf]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infections treated in the outpatient setting and range in severity from minimally symptomatic cystitis to severe septic shock in a wide array of patients. Diagnosis of uncomplicated cystitis can be inferred from history and physical, and confirmed by urinalysis. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy should rapidly improve symptoms in all UTIs. Treatment can be further tailored according to severity of illness, analysis of individualized risk factors, and antimicrobial resistance patterns. This article discusses treatment options in light of bacterial resistance in the twenty-first century.

### Molecular determinants of disease severity in urinary tract infection [^3f7609b5]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2021). High credibility.

The most common and lethal bacterial pathogens have co-evolved with the host. Pathogens are the aggressors, and the host immune system is responsible for the defence. However, immune responses can also become destructive, and excessive innate immune activation is a major cause of infection-associated morbidity, exemplified by symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs), which are caused, in part, by excessive innate immune activation. Severe kidney infections (acute pyelonephritis) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and painful infections of the urinary bladder (acute cystitis) can become debilitating in susceptible patients. Disease severity is controlled at specific innate immune checkpoints, and a detailed understanding of their functions is crucial for strategies to counter microbial aggression with novel treatment and prevention measures. One approach is the use of bacterial molecules that reprogramme the innate immune system, accelerating or inhibiting disease processes. A very different outcome is asymptomatic bacteriuria, defined by low host immune responsiveness to bacteria with attenuated virulence. This observation provides the rationale for immunomodulation as a new therapeutic tool to deliberately modify host susceptibility, control the host response and avoid severe disease. The power of innate immunity as an arbitrator of health and disease is also highly relevant for emerging pathogens, including the current COVID-19 pandemic.

### Medical treatment for urinary tract infections [^72f58a6d]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common source of morbidity and require significant health care resources for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Antimicrobials represent the mainstay for the treatment of UTIs. Established guidelines exist for the antimicrobial treatment and prevention of uncomplicated UTIs; however, antimicrobial dependence and overuse have led to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Nonantimicrobial alternatives are an ongoing area of research and should be considered when clinically appropriate based on available evidence.

### Polymicrobial interactions in the urinary tract: is the enemy of my enemy my friend? [^bd2b5e4b]. Infection and Immunity (2021). Medium credibility.

The vast majority of research pertaining to urinary tract infection has focused on a single pathogen in isolation, and predominantly Escherichia coli. However, polymicrobial urine colonization and infection are prevalent in several patient populations, including individuals with urinary catheters. The progression from asymptomatic colonization to symptomatic infection and severe disease is likely shaped by interactions between traditional pathogens as well as constituents of the normal urinary microbiota. Recent studies have begun to experimentally dissect the contribution of polymicrobial interactions to disease outcomes in the urinary tract, including their role in development of antimicrobial-resistant biofilm communities, modulating the innate immune response, tissue damage, and sepsis. This review aims to summarize the epidemiology of polymicrobial urine colonization, provide an overview of common urinary tract pathogens, and present key microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions that influence infection progression, persistence, and severity.

### Recurrent UTIs in girls: what is the role of the microbiome? [^e15fb66d]. Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common childhood bacterial infections. Recurrent UTIs can lead to renal scarring. Compared to boys, girls are more likely to develop scars as a result of recurrent UTIs. Therefore, there is a need to identify girls at high risk for recurrent UTIs and develop interventions to decrease the risk of recurrent UTIs. In this commentary, we will review the hypothesized pathophysiology of recurrent UTIs, explore the literature on the role of the microbiome in recurrent UTIs, focusing on female pediatric patients when able, and highlight the need for future research in this area.

### Urinary tract infections: core curriculum 2024 [^52dde126]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are some of the most commonly encountered infections in clinical practice. Accurate diagnosis and evidence-based treatment of UTIs will lead to better clinical care for many patients and limit unnecessary antibiotic use. Urinalysis and urine cultures are helpful tools in the diagnosis of UTIs; however, it is important to recognize their limitations. Differentiating between asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and true UTI is important because antibiotics are unnecessary in most nonpregnant patients with ASB and can even potentially cause harm if prescribed. Choice and duration of antibiotics varies across the spectrum of UTI syndromes such as acute uncomplicated cystitis, pyelonephritis, prostatitis, and catheter-associated UTIs. The treatment approach also depends on patients' degree of immunosuppression and their genitourinary anatomy. Therefore, patients with urological obstruction or kidney transplants may require a specialized and multidisciplinary management approach. For individuals prone to frequent UTIs, some preventative measures can be utilized, yet there is often not a "one size fits all" approach.

### Pediatric urinary tract infection: does the evidence support aggressively pursuing the diagnosis? [^361bf94e]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The epidemiology of pediatric fever has changed considerably during the past 2 decades with the development of vaccines against the most common bacterial pathogens causing bacteremia and meningitis. The decreasing incidence of these 2 conditions among vaccinated children has led to an emphasis on urinary tract infection as a remaining source of potentially hidden infections in febrile children. Emerging literature, however, has led to questions about both the degree and nature of the danger posed by urinary tract infection in nonverbal children, whereas the aggressive pursuit of the diagnosis consumes resources and leads to patient discomfort, medical risks, and potential overdiagnosis. We review both early and emerging literature to examine the utility and efficacy of early identification and treatment of urinary tract infection in children younger than 24 months. We conclude that in well children of this age, it may be reasonable to withhold or delay testing for urinary tract infection if signs of other sources are apparent or if the fever has been present for fewer than 4 to 5 days.

### Microbial virulence determinants and the pathogenesis of urinary tract infection [^94eb0583]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The most frequent and best-studied agent of urinary tract infection (UTI) is Escherichia coli, which serves as a useful model pathogen for understanding microbial virulence in relation to UTI pathogenesis. The E. coli strains that cause most UTIs and other extraintestinal E. coli infections represent a highly specialized subset of the total E. coli population. The enhanced virulence potential of such strains, which collectively are known as uropathogenic E. coli or extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC), is thought to be caused mainly by their multiple virulence factors. These virulence factors include diverse adhesins, siderophores, toxins, polysaccharide coatings, and other properties that assist the bacteria in avoiding or subverting host defenses, injuring or invading host cells and tissues, and stimulating a noxious inflammatory response. Although the true evolutionary basis for ExPEC is unknown, the virulence factors of ExPEC serve as useful epidemiologic markers and in the future may provide effective targets for anti-UTI interventions.

### Host-pathogen interactions in urinary tract infection [^fd676100]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2010). Medium credibility.

The urinary tract is a common site of bacterial infections; nearly half of all women experience at least one urinary tract infection (UTI) during their lifetime. These infections are classified based on the condition of the host. Uncomplicated infections affect otherwise healthy individuals and are most commonly caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli, whereas complicated infections affect patients with underlying difficulties, such as a urinary tract abnormality or catheterization, and are commonly caused by species such as Proteus mirabilis. Virulence and fitness factors produced by both pathogens include fimbriae, toxins, flagella, iron acquisition systems, and proteins that function in immune evasion. Additional factors that contribute to infection include the formation of intracellular bacterial communities by E. coli and the production of urease by P. mirabilis, which can result in urinary stone formation. Innate immune responses are induced or mediated by pattern recognition receptors, antimicrobial peptides, and neutrophils. The adaptive immune response to UTI is less well understood. Host factors TLR4 and CXCR1 are implicated in disease outcome and susceptibility, respectively. Low levels of TLR4 are associated with asymptomatic bacteriuria while low levels of CXCR1 are associated with increased incidence of acute pyelonephritis. Current research is focused on the identification of additional virulence factors and therapeutic or prophylactic targets that might be used in the generation of vaccines against both uropathogens.

### Laboratory diagnosis of urinary tract infections in adult patients [^c0eb7011]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections and account for a significant part of the workload in clinical microbiology laboratories. Enteric bacteria (in particular, Escherichia coli) remain the most frequent cause of UTIs, although the distribution of pathogens that cause UTIs is changing. More important is the increase in resistance to some antimicrobial agents, particularly the resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole seen in E. coli. Physicians distinguish UTIs from other diseases that have similar clinical presentations with use of a small number of tests, none of which, if used individually, have adequate sensitivity and specificity. Among the diagnostic tests, urinalysis is useful mainly for excluding bacteriuria. Urine culture may not be necessary as part of the evaluation of outpatients with uncomplicated UTIs, but it is necessary for outpatients who have recurrent UTIs, experience treatment failures, or have complicated UTIs, as well as for inpatients who develop UTIs.

### CAUTIon-not all UTIs are the same [^76dd1cc8]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2025). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common infections, accounting for ~400 million diagnoses per year worldwide. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTIs) occur in healthy individuals with no structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary system and primarily affect women. Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are a type of complicated UTI affecting patients who have a urinary catheter in place, often hospitalized patients or patients with conditions that prevent them from urinating naturally. Both infections share common symptoms, diagnostics and treatment options but also differ greatly in pathophysiology, aetiology, risk factors and comorbidities. These differences could explain why antibiotic treatments - which generally lead to positive outcomes in patients with uUTIs - often fail in patients with CAUTIs. Understanding these differences could guide evidence-based insights into why treatments for CAUTIs should be different from those for uUTIs, specifically, by modifying catheters, which initiate the damage-induced segue for UTIs.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^03e88d61]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) present a challenge to the clinician because of the variety of clinical syndromes included and consequent difficulties in synthesizing evidence for practical guidance. The cumulative incidence of all childhood UTI by the age of 7 years is 1%–2% in boys and 7% in girls. Of those presenting to emergency, 5%–24% are deemed cUTI, so it is a common childhood infection. However, defining what makes a UTI complicated is difficult because it has been characterized by a variety of UTI syndromes, which include hosts with abnormal urology or other underlying conditions, severe clinical presentations with or without extensive tissue involvement, and unusual pathogens. For this review and guideline, cUTIs are those that require other management considerations than straightforward lower or upper tract UTIs for which evidence and guidelines exist. Accurate diagnosis and management of cUTI limit morbidity and mortality from sepsis and long-term renal damage. However, most trials of UTI in children have excluded those with cUTI, and consequently, many guidelines also exclude them. The absence of a standardized definition for cUTI has resulted in inconsistencies in treatment approaches, which may lead to increased morbidity among affected children. Existing major UTI guidelines for children either do not address complicated UTIs at all or are limited to only some complications or some age groups. –

This review aims to address the four most important controversies when managing children with cUTI and provide recommendations for definition, investigations, treatment and follow-up. The resulting guidelines offer evidence-graded recommendations specifically for the management of pediatric cUTI, addressing gaps that exist in current guidelines.

### Uncomplicated urinary tract infection in adults including uncomplicated pyelonephritis [^1633faca]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection and acute pyelonephritis are very common infections affecting many women throughout their lives. The determinants of infection have been well described and current strategies to prevent recurrent infections are highly effective. While antimicrobial management is straightforward for most episodes, the evolution of antimicrobial susceptibility of E. coli in community-acquired infection requires continuing re-evaluation of appropriate empiric therapy.

### Urinary cell-free DNA is a versatile analyte for monitoring infections of the urinary tract [^63aa91d1]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common infections in humans. Here we tested the utility of urinary cell-free DNA (cfDNA) to comprehensively monitor host and pathogen dynamics in bacterial and viral urinary tract infections. We isolated cfDNA from 141 urine samples from a cohort of 82 kidney transplant recipients and performed next-generation sequencing. We found that urinary cfDNA is highly informative about bacterial and viral composition of the microbiome, antimicrobial susceptibility, bacterial growth dynamics, kidney allograft injury, and host response to infection. These different layers of information are accessible from a single assay and individually agree with corresponding clinical tests based on quantitative PCR, conventional bacterial culture, and urinalysis. In addition, cfDNA reveals the frequent occurrence of pathologies that remain undiagnosed with conventional diagnostic protocols. Our work identifies urinary cfDNA as a highly versatile analyte to monitor infections of the urinary tract.

### An update on uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^4eeb6900]. Current Opinion in Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women comprise uncomplicated and complicated UTIs. Uncomplicated UTIs, such as acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis, are very common infections in otherwise healthy women, with a high tendency to recur. Although severe complications are rare, their high prevalence causes remarkable costs in the healthcare systems.

Recent Findings

As most scientific evidence has been gathered in uncomplicated UTI, this study focuses on recent developments in epidemiology, pathogenesis, cause, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of uncomplicated UTI and recurrent UTI in women.

Summary

A remarkable increase of antibiotic resistance is also noted in uncomplicated UTI. Therefore, prudent use of antibiotic substances in uncomplicated UTI is increasingly important.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^b69aa99f]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

UTIs are opportunistic infections, whereby pathogens ascend from colonizing niches (the gut, perineum, and/or vagina) into the urinary tract. Escherichia coli is the most common agent of UTIs, causing 65%–75% of infections overall. Beyond E. coli, the taxonomic landscape of UTIs is incredibly diverse. For uncomplicated infections, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Klebsiella pneumoniae are also commonly observed. In the setting of cUTIs, when host comorbidities present added opportunities for infection, a broad array of bacteria are observed including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other Enterobacterales (Proteus, Serratia, and Enterobacter spp.), and Enterococcus spp. For some microorganisms, the diagnostic significance in urine is not always clear and may be context dependent, including Staphylococcus aureus and Candida spp. The diagnostic status quo is likewise complicated by several rare, but well-established, uropathogens with more fastidious growth characteristics, and a growing list of species whose status as commensal-versus-pathogen is not always clear. The diagnostic challenge posed by such emerging uropathogens is detailed further below.

Against this complex background, traditional diagnostic cultures — together with urinalysis — represent staples of care. At the same time, there is a growing desire for UTI diagnostics that leverage new technology for more sensitive, specific, or rapid results. Of particular interest are tools that reduce the latency between initial, empiric UTI management and targeted therapy, based on species identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST). Various new platforms for UTI diagnosis are under development. The ultimate clinical impact of these tools will be a function of the method, interpretation, cost, regulatory status, population tested, and even the rapidly growing knowledge on urinary tract microbiology. To these ends, we provide a technical overview of these emerging technologies.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^78dc8cef]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — definitions and terminology state that a commonly used definition describes urinary tract infection (UTI) as an infection of the lower and/or upper genitourinary tract which is diagnosed based on the presence of a pathogen in the urinary tract and associated symptoms, with limited evidence to support any "gold standard" UTI definition for epidemiologic or clinical research; this statement endorses a clinically useful, culture-based definition for rUTI of at least 2 culture-proven episodes in 6 months, or at least 3 in 1 year, and distinguishes relapse as UTI symptoms with the same uropathogen within 2 weeks of completing appropriate antibiotic therapy versus recurrence beyond the initial 2 weeks or with a different uropathogen.

### Antibiotic resistance of urinary tract infection recurrences in a large integrated US healthcare system [^24e7615f]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in the United States (US), primarily affecting women. In the US, half of women experience ≥ 1 UTI by the age of 35 years, and 1 in 3 women experiences ≥ 1 UTI requiring antibiotic treatment in her lifetime, with 11% experiencing ≥ 1 UTI per year. UTI incidence in the US increased by 52% between 1998 and 2011, resulting in 400 000 hospitalizations with an estimated cost of $2.8 billion in 2011. UTIs have also been increasing in outpatient settings and cause substantial negative impact on activity and health-related quality of life.

Uropathogenic Escherichia coli is the most common pathogen causing UTIs. Escherichia coli accounts for up to 80% of uncomplicated UTIs (uUTIs), which typically affect otherwise healthy individuals without underlying structural abnormalities or instrumentation, and approximately a quarter of complicated UTIs (cUTIs), which occur in the presence of structural abnormalities or instrumentation compromising the urinary tract. Other gram-negative pathogens such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and gram-positive pathogens such as Staphylococcus spp, Enterococcus faecalis, and group B Streptococcus can also cause UTIs. Following an initial uUTI, subsequent UTIs are common and may be caused by the same or different pathogens.

Antibiotic treatment for UTI is often empiric without urine culture or susceptibility testing, and is usually based on national guidelines and local resistance profiles. The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), nitrofurantoin, or fosfomycin as first-line therapy. UTIs also have a high recurrence rate, leading to increased use of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance in uropathogens has been increasing, resulting in increased risk of treatment failure, patient morbidity, healthcare costs, and use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, further exacerbating antibiotic resistance.

Given the continued burden of UTIs, current data on repeated occurrence of UTI are needed. Also, despite global increases in multidrug resistance (MDR), recent data on antibiotic resistance of uropathogens are lacking, especially antibiotic resistance patterns for those patients experiencing UTI recurrences. Leveraging electronic health records (EHR) from a cohort of individuals with uUTI at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC), we described the antibiotic resistance of subsequent uUTIs and cUTIs (from 2016–2021) following an initial uUTI (from 2016–2020).

### Consensus position statement on advancing the classification of patients and tests of cure in studies of antibiotic treatment of complicated urinary tract infections [^1ec6abc3]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infections denote an important research field for new antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens. There is, however, increasing concern that this disease entity is too vaguely defined, leading to heterogeneous study populations and risk of bias. We analysed researchers' adherence to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and assessed risk of bias using a three-step procedure: literature review of full-text articles on complicated urinary tract infection; assessment of the importance of risk factors for treatment failure, including statistical evaluation of how patients with risk factors might skew treatment effects; and a Delphi consensus process in a multidisciplinary group. Our evaluation showed poor adherence to FDA guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and significant heterogeneity in the reporting of study, patient, and pathogen characteristics, leading to a high risk of bias when interpreting and comparing study findings. We therefore question the concept of complicated urinary tract infection as a meaningful entity with its own study guidance.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^2bbe6934]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) impose a substantial burden on patient quality of life and urine testing accounts for the majority of workload in many clinical microbiology laboratories. Traditional UTI diagnosis relies on symptoms, urinalysis, and culture which are interpreted based on historical guidelines. This approach, while foundational, presents limitations, particularly in complex cases. Low-level bacteriuria and the presence of fastidious organisms are often overlooked or entirely missed in standard urine culture, stressing the need for novel diagnostic methods and technologies. This mini-review summarizes the existing state of UTI diagnostics in 2024 and covers current and upcoming technologies including rapid molecular-based pathogen identification, next-generation sequencing, and advanced antimicrobial susceptibility testing. However, these methods represent unique challenges, and as they are implemented, they will require the field to adapt to new concepts to avoid misdiagnosis and overtreatment.

### Compliance to international guidelines and rational use of antibiotics in urinary tract infections in a country without national guidance: a cross-sectional study [^5311e3c1]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in humans. Women are significantly more affected than men: one in three women will have at least one episode of UTI by the age of 24, and roughly 50% of women will experience a UTI in their lifetime.

UTIs are classified according to the site of infection (pyelonephritis, cystitis, urethritis and prostatitis) and the presence of risk factors for complications. While asymptomatic UTIs are left untreated in most cases according to guidelines, the high incidence of symptomatic UTIs that require antibiotics (ATBs) emphasises the need to ensure appropriate therapy with agents that maximise success and minimise the risk of resistance.

According to the WHO, rational drug use requires that patients receive drugs appropriate to their clinical condition, in doses that suit their needs, for an adequate period of time and at the lowest cost for themselves and their community.

### Urinary tract infections in children: an overview of diagnosis and management [^f3ef8554]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common and potentially serious bacterial infection of childhood. History and examination findings can be non-specific, so a urine sample is required to diagnose UTI. Sample collection in young precontinent children can be challenging. Bedside dipstick tests are useful for screening, but urine culture is required for diagnostic confirmation. Antibiotic therapy must be guided by local guidelines due to increasing antibiotic resistance. Duration of therapy and indications for imaging remain controversial topics and guidelines lack consensus. This article presents an overview of paediatric UTI diagnosis and management, with highlights of recent advances and evidence updates.

### Quality appraisal of clinical guidelines for recurrent urinary tract infections using AGREE II: a systematic review [^68885b72]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections worldwide, being experienced by one in three women at least once in their lifetime. Recurrent UTI is defined as more than three infections per year or more than two infections per 6 months, and it has a significant impact on quality of life, as highlighted by an international web-based survey of 1941 affected women. There is also a significant economic burden due to the costs of preventive strategies and sick leave. Most recurrent UTIs occur in otherwise healthy women who have no structural genitourinary tract abnormalities.

CPGs are defined as "systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate healthcare in specific clinical circumstances" and are developed to optimize and standardize care. The successful implementation of a CPG depends on rigorous development, a clear implementation strategy, and adequate dissemination. Multiple studies across different clinical areas have shown that variability exists in the quality of CPGs, indicating that there is considerable room for improvement, especially in rigour of development and applicability. This is important because diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty can ensue if CPGs differ in core recommendations because of these limitations.

Differences in clinical practice guideline (CPG) recommendations for the preventive treatment of recurrent UTI have been mentioned previously, but the authors of that report did not assess methodological quality. As a result, diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty might ensue. We could find not a systematic appraisal of the quality of CPGs for the prevention and diagnostics of recurrent UTI in women. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument is often used to assess the methodological quality of CPGs in other areas. We therefore aimed to assess the methodological quality of CPGs for recurrent UTI and to summarize recommendations to help clinical decision makers choose the correct CPG for treatment or diagnostics.

### Risk factors for recurrent urinary tract infections among women in a large integrated health care organization in the United States [^3e4881e6]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections, with an estimated annual incidence of > 150 million cases worldwide. In the United States, UTIs result in approximately 10.5 million office visits as well as 3 million emergency department (ED) encounters and 400 000 hospitalizations annually with an estimated annual cost > $4.8 billion. UTIs primarily affect women, followed by male infants and older men. Based on epidemiologic data from a study in the United States, about 1 in 3 women have at least 1 UTI diagnosed by a clinician that requires antibiotic medication, and the lifetime risk of UTIs among women is > 60%.

Clinically, UTIs are categorized as uncomplicated or complicated. Uncomplicated UTIs (uUTIs) can be differentiated into lower (cystitis) and upper (pyelonephritis). uUTIs typically affect individuals who are otherwise healthy. Approximately 75% of uUTIs are caused by extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and other pathogens. Complicated UTIs are associated with factors compromising the urinary tract or host defense, such as urinary obstruction, immunosuppression, renal failure/transplantation, and indwelling catheterization. In the United States, 70% to 80% of complicated UTIs are attributable to indwelling catheters, accounting for 1 million cases per year.

### The etiology of urinary tract infection: traditional and emerging pathogens [^7afb34b9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The microbial etiology of urinary infections has been regarded as well established and reasonably consistent. Escherichia coli remains the predominant uropathogen (80%) isolated in acute community-acquired uncomplicated infections, followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus (10% to 15%). Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Proteus species, and enterococci infrequently cause uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis. The pathogens traditionally associated with UTI are changing many of their features, particularly because of antimicrobial resistance. The etiology of UTI is also affected by underlying host factors that complicate UTI, such as age, diabetes, spinal cord injury, or catheterization. Consequently, complicated UTI has a more diverse etiology than uncomplicated UTI, and organisms that rarely cause disease in healthy patients can cause significant disease in hosts with anatomic, metabolic, or immunologic underlying disease. The majority of community-acquired symptomatic UTIs in elderly women are caused by E coli. However, gram-positive organisms are common, and polymicrobial infections account for up to 1 in 3 infections in the elderly. In comparison, the most common organisms isolated in children with uncomplicated UTI are Enterobacteriaceae. Etiologic pathogens associated with UTI among patients with diabetes include Klebsiella spp. Group B streptococci, and Enterococcus spp., as well as E coli. Patients with spinal cord injuries commonly have E coli infections. Other common uropathogens include Pseudomonas and Proteus mirabilis. Recent advances in molecular biology may facilitate the identification of new etiologic agents for UTI. The need for accurate and updated population surveillance data is apparent, particularly in light of concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance. This information will directly affect selection of empiric therapy for UTI.

### Phage therapy for urinary tract infections: progress and challenges ahead [^5f9887fe]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common types of bacterial infection, affecting at least 150 million people annually worldwide based on epidemiological estimates over 2 decades ago, with recent estimates as high as 400 million. Half of women will have at least one UTI during their lifetime and of these ~ 30% will develop recurrent UTI (defined as symptomatic culture-proven UTI at least twice in 6 months or three times in a year). Recurrent UTI is associated with the development of intracellular bacterial reservoirs, which may serve as the nidus for subsequent infections and reduce the efficacy of antibiotic therapy. Recurrent UTI is associated with repetitive and extended antibiotic use and poses significant therapeutic and public health issues owing to alarming increases in antibiotic resistance. Additionally, the development of new antibiotics has been unable to keep up with the concerning rise in antibiotic resistance, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic options. Current vaccine trials for UTI have had limited impact. Here, we review the putative role of bacteriophage (phage) therapy as a therapeutic for UTI, highlight patient and microbiological factors that might impact successful treatment, and suggest reporting standards for future work to help to advance the field.

### Global epidemiology of urinary tract infections [^719a3fe5]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Both in the community and hospital setting, urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common. Initial appropriate empirical treatment requires a good knowledge of epidemiological data. In this review, the most recent global epidemiological data of UTIs have been summarized.

Recent Findings

Community-associated UTI (CAUTI) prevalence is 0.7% and the main risk factors are age, history of UTI, sexual activity and diabetes. The most common pathogen is Escherichia coli and resistance rates to common antibiotics depend very much on the geographical location. The lowest observed resistance was for fosfomycin (range: 0–2.9%), nitrofurantoin (range: 0–4.4%) and mecillinam (range: 0–4%). Healthcare-associated UTI (HAUTI) frequency among HCAIs is 12.9 (confidence interval: 10.2–16%), 19.6 and 24% in the United States, Europe and developing countries, respectively. In urology departments, the prevalence is 5.1%. Resistance to almost all antibiotics in HAUTIs is above 20% and there is a significant geographical variation. Community onset HAUTIs bacterial spectrum is similar to hospital onset HAUTIs and different from CAUTIs.

Summary

It is challenging to provide with an exact frequency of UTIs. Both CAUTI and HAUTI frequency, pathogen spectrum and resistance rates vary according to geographical setting.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^e04c5ca1]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

From a microbial perspective, each uropathogenic species may carry its own infection dynamics, such that employing universal thresholds across all species to define infection (e.g. ≥ 10 5 CFU/mL) is likely an oversimplification. Some patients may experience symptomatic infections with bacterial counts as low as 10 2 CFU/mL. Not only are these levels below the limit of detection of a standard 1 µL inoculum, but they overlap with potential levels of contamination. Unfortunately, in deciphering low-level pathogens from prominent contaminants, a laboratory cannot directly control for the variable quality of specimen collection, and a traditional culture cannot differentiate the active pathological process of a UTI from colonization/ASB.

### Antibiotic resistance of urinary tract infection recurrences in a large integrated US healthcare system [^bf151867]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Increasing antibiotic resistance limits antibiotic options for outpatient treatment of UTIs and renders antibiotic treatment less effective. As repeated UTIs are a major cause of antibiotic resistance, a better understanding of uropathogens responsible for recurrence is needed. Importantly, given that antibiotic therapy for UTI is empiric and uropathogens increasingly demonstrate nonsusceptibility, continuously updated data on susceptibility patterns are critical to guide appropriate antibiotic prescribing as well as to inform interventions to prevent UTI recurrence. As the degree of resistance to the most frequently prescribed antibiotics for UTI evolves over time and may vary by region, it is also important to continuously monitor the local prevalence of uropathogens and their susceptibility to guide appropriate antibiotic use.

### Management of urinary tract infections in elderly patients: strategies for improvement [^82c45181]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Problem

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common infections affecting the elderly in both the primary and secondary care settings. Despite being common, the inpatient management of UTIs has been suboptimal. Clinicians are often overtreating elderly patients on the basis of non-specific symptoms. In most cases, there are insufficient recorded enquiries of lower urinary tract symptoms. Urine samples are also poorly collected for cultures and sensitivities. Therefore, many patients may be treated with antimicrobials to which the causative organism is resistant.

This project aimed to look into potential strategies for improving the management of UTI in elderly medical inpatients. These include increasing adherence to Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) guidelines on the diagnosis of UTI, increasing the frequency and timeliness of urinary culture collection in suspected UTI, and increasing use of urine culture sensitivities to tailor antimicrobial therapy.

### Resistant pathogens in urinary tract infections [^aecdc483]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2002). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria causing urinary tract infection (UTI) has evolved over several decades as antimicrobial exposure has repeatedly been followed by emergence of resistance. Older populations in the community, long-term care facilities, or acute care facilities have an increased prevalence of resistant bacteria isolated from UTI. Resistant isolates are more frequent in long-term care populations than the community. Resistant isolates include common uropathogens, such as Escherichia coli or Proteus mirabilis, and organisms with higher levels of intrinsic resistance, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Providencia stuartii. Isolation of resistant organisms is consistently associated with prior antimicrobial exposure and higher functional impairment. The increased likelihood of resistant bacteria makes it essential that a urine specimen for culture and susceptibility testing be obtained before instituting antimicrobial therapy. Therapy for the individual patient must be balanced with the possibility that antimicrobial use will promote further resistance. Antimicrobial therapy should be avoided unless there is a clear clinical indication. In particular, asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated with antimicrobials. Where symptoms are mild or equivocal, urine culture results should be obtained before initiating therapy. This permits selection of specific therapy for the infecting organism and avoids empiric, usually broad-spectrum, therapy. Where empirical therapy is necessary, prior infecting organisms should be isolated, and recent antimicrobial therapy, as well as regional or facility susceptibility patterns, should be considered in antimicrobial choice. Where empirical therapy is used, it should be reassessed 48 to 72 hours after initiation, once pretherapy cultures are available.

### Treatment of bacterial urinary tract infections: presence and future [^2aca5aa2]. European Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) are frequent infections in the outpatient as well as in the nosocomial setting. The stratification into uncomplicated and complicated UTIs has proven to be clinically useful. Bacterial virulence factors on the one side and the integrity of the host defense mechanisms on the other side determine the course of the infection. In uncomplicated UTIs Escherichia coli is the leading organism, whereas in complicated UTIs the bacterial spectrum is much broader including Gram-negative and Gram-positive and often multiresistant organisms. The therapy of uncomplicated UTIs is almost exclusively antibacterial, whereas in complicated UTIs the complicating factors have to be treated as well. There are two predominant aims in the antimicrobial treatment of both uncomplicated and complicated UTIs: (i) rapid and effective response to therapy and prevention of recurrence of the individual patient treated; (ii) prevention of emergence of resistance to antimicrobial chemotherapy in the microbial environment. The main drawback of current antibiotic therapies is the emergence and rapid increase of antibiotic resistance. To combat this development several strategies can be followed. Decrease the amount of antibiotics administered, optimal dosing, prevention of infection and development of new antibiotic substances. The aim of this review is to highlight the current and to describe future treatment options for UTIs.

### Urinary tract infections in pregnant individuals [^59262603]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

ACOG Clinical Consensus — Urinary tract infections in pregnant individuals — affecting approximately 8% of pregnancies, represent a spectrum from asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) to symptomatic acute cystitis to pyelonephritis, and are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes including increased rates of preterm delivery and low birth weight. Urinary tract infections are classified by site as lower urinary tract (ASB or cystitis) or upper urinary tract (pyelonephritis), with asymptomatic bacteriuria identified in 2–10% of pregnant patients. Overall, Escherichia coli is the most common bacterial pathogen isolated in urine samples from pregnant individuals, and serious maternal complications of pyelonephritis include sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Screening for and treating asymptomatic bacteriuria have been shown in multiple studies to reduce the incidence of pyelonephritis in pregnancy.

### A genome-wide association study of susceptibility to upper urinary tract infections [^e8b061e5]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections worldwide, with a significant clinical and economic burden. UTIs typically affect the lower urinary tract (eg, bladder [cystitis]), but the infection may ascend upward in the urinary tract to cause upper UTIs — ureteritis affecting the ureters, or pyelonephritis affecting the kidneys — which are less common but more severe. Therefore, differentiating between lower and upper UTIs is important in terms of etiology and outcomes. As is the case for other infections, the risk of acquiring upper UTIs involves a complex interplay between host genetic factors, the virulence of the pathogen, and individual patient clinical characteristics such as anatomy and underlying risk factors.

While many complex diseases have clear links to genetic variants, the genetic susceptibility to upper UTIs remains largely unknown. Previous family-based studies have found that different genetic mechanisms may influence the susceptibility of lower and upper UTIs. Among these, 1 family study found an increased frequency of acute pyelonephritis (ie, upper UTI) in family members of acute pyelonephritis–prone children, while no differences were observed for acute cystitis (ie, lower UTI). However, few genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been conducted on upper UTIs. As of today, only 1 published GWAS has been conducted on pyelonephritis, where 1 locus on chromosome 14 close to LINC02302 was found to be strongly associated with pyelonephritis using data from BioBank Japan. There is, therefore, a need for GWASs conducted on upper UTIs to identify genes and pathways associated with susceptibility to upper UTIs, which may be important for risk stratification and prevention and may also lead to new insight into therapeutic targets.

### Urinary tract infections in children [^4f15c1f3]. Pediatrics in Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for the evaluation, treatment, and management of urinary tract infections (UTIs), UTI diagnosis and management remains challenging for clinicians. Challenges with acute UTI management stem from vague presenting signs and symptoms, diagnostic uncertainty, limitations in laboratory testing, and selecting appropriate antibiotic therapy in an era with increasing rates of antibiotic-resistant uropathogens. Recurrent UTI management remains difficult due to an incomplete understanding of the factors contributing to UTI, when to assess a child with repeated infections for kidney and urinary tract anomalies, and limited prevention strategies. To help reduce these uncertainties, this review provides a comprehensive overview of UTI epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies that may help pediatricians overcome the challenges associated with acute and recurrent UTI management.

### Urinary tract infections in children [^dd003432]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children are among the most common bacterial infections in childhood. They are equally common in boys and girls during the first year of life and become more common in girls after the first year of life. Dividing UTIs into three categories; febrile upper UTI (acute pyelonephritis), lower UTI (cystitis), and asymptomatic bacteriuria, is useful for numerous reasons, mainly because it helps to understand the pathophysiology of the infection. A single episode of febrile UTI is often caused by a virulent Escherichia coli strain, whereas recurrent infections and asymptomatic bacteriuria commonly result from urinary tract malformations or bladder disturbances. Treatment of an upper UTI needs to be broad and last for 10 days, a lower UTI only needs to be treated for 3 days, often with a narrow-spectrum antibiotic, and asymptomatic bacteriuria is best left untreated. Investigations of atypical and recurrent episodes of febrile UTI should focus on urinary tract abnormalities, whereas in cases of cystitis and asymptomatic bacteriuria the focus should be on bladder function.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^fc1d9dae]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) antibiotic duration — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course of antimicrobials, using either 5–7 days of a fluoroquinolone (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence) or 7 days of a non-fluoroquinolone antibiotic (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence), rather than a longer course (10–14 days). An effective antimicrobial agent achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy. Most studies supporting this recommendation excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, severe sepsis, immunocompromising conditions, abscesses in the urinary tract, chronic kidney disease, bacterial prostatitis, complete urinary obstruction, or undergoing urologic surgical procedures. Some patients in these subpopulations may be at higher risk for complications or treatment failure and may need an individualized duration of therapy. Men with febrile UTI in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement.

### European Association of Urology guidelines on urological infections: summary of the 2024 guidelines [^5165eba0]. European Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

Urological infections significantly impact the wellbeing and quality of life of individuals owing to their widespread occurrence and diverse clinical manifestations. The objective of the guidelines panel was to provide evidence-based guidance on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and male accessory-gland infections, while addressing crucial public health aspects related to infection control and antimicrobial stewardship.

Methods

For the 2024 guidelines on urological infections, new and relevant evidence was identified, collated, and appraised via a structured assessment of the literature. Databases searched included Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries. Recommendations within the guidelines were developed by the panel to prioritise clinically important care decisions. The strength of each recommendation was determined according to a balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative management strategies, the quality of the evidence (including the certainty of estimates), and the nature and variability of patient values and preferences.

Key Findings and Limitations

Key recommendations emphasise the importance of a thorough medical history and physical examination for patients with urological infections. The guidelines stress the role of antimicrobial stewardship to combat the rising threat of antimicrobial resistance, providing recommendations for antibiotic selection, dosing, and duration on the basis of the latest evidence.

Conclusions and Clinical Implications

This overview of the 2024 EAU guidelines offers valuable insights into managing urological infections and are designed for effective integration into clinical practice.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^64426449]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology and microbiology — standard cultures indicate that Escherichia coli (E. coli) causes most community-acquired urinary tract infections (70%–95%) and is also the most common cause of rUTI (66%); uropathogens in rUTI are the same microbes as episode (non–rUTI) UTI episodes, but non–E. coli pathogens and resistant organisms are more likely in women with rUTI; episodes of rUTIs are often associated with the same bacterial strain, and uropathogenic E. coli can form intracellular bacterial communities that act like a biofilm and persist in quiescent intracellular reservoirs, acting as a source of recurrent infection.

Introduction

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common infections worldwide, particularly in developing countries. This infection is observed in all age groups of people of both sexes and affects more than 150 million people, resulting in over $6 billion in cost per year globally. The majority of UTIs are caused by bacteria, especially Gram-negative bacteria. Among Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli (E. coli) is the most common, followed by Proteus species, Klebsiella species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter species, and Citrobacter species, which are the common isolates that affect the urinary system. These bacteria are transferred from the gastrointestinal tract to the urethral opening and begin to multiply. They cause subsequent infection of any part of the urinary system, including the urethra, bladder, ureters, and kidneys.

Clinically, UTIs are classified as uncomplicated or complicated infections. The former can affect healthy individuals who have no renal system structural or functional abnormalities. However, the latter occurs in patients who have structural or functional abnormalities in the renal system. Bacterial UTIs occur in both community and, most commonly, hospital settings and account for 40% of all nosocomial infections. As 15–25% of hospitalized patients use urinary catheters, the most common nosocomial UTI is catheter-associated UTI, which accounts for 75–80% of all nosocomial urinary infections and 30–40% of all hospital-acquired infections.

In developing countries, the empirical management of UTI may contribute to the emergence and spread of resistant strains, such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and carbapenemase-producing bacteria. Prolonged use of urinary catheters can further serve as a reservoir for these multidrug-resistant bacteria.

### Recurrent urinary tract infections in women: diagnosis and management [^0ef82271]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infections, presenting as dysuria or irritative voiding symptoms, are most commonly caused by reinfection with the original bacterial isolate in young, otherwise healthy women with no anatomic or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract. Frequency of sexual intercourse is the strongest predictor of recurrent urinary tract infections in patients presenting with recurrent dysuria. In those who have comorbid conditions or other predisposing factors, recurrent complicated urinary tract infections represent a risk for ascending infection or urosepsis. Escherichia coli is the most common organism in all patient groups, but Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Proteus, and other organisms are more common in patients with certain risk factors for complicated urinary tract infections. A positive urine culture with greater than 102 colony-forming units per mL is the standard for diagnosing urinary tract infections in symptomatic patients, although culture is often unnecessary for diagnosing typical symptomatic infection. Women with recurrent symptomatic urinary tract infections can be treated with continuous or postcoital prophylactic antibiotics; other treatment options include self-started antibiotics, cranberry products, and behavioral modification. Patients at risk of complicated urinary tract infections are best managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics initially, urine culture to guide subsequent therapy, and renal imaging studies if structural abnormalities are suspected.

### Resistance trends in urinary tract pathogens and impact on management [^8233fe3a]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among urinary tract pathogens is reviewed and its clinical impact on management is determined.

Materials and Methods

A Medline search supplemented with references quoted in bibliographies of articles on urinary tract infections, epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens and clinical outcomes in urinary tract infections was conducted.

Results

Although some geographic variation is noted in resistance rates among urinary tract Escherichia coli isolates, rates were highest for ampicillin (39% to 45%) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (14% to 31.4%) and lowest for nitrofurantoin (1.8% to 16%) and fluoroquinolones (0.7% to 10%). Resistance rates also varied based on patient age. A few studies suggested that antimicrobial resistance impacts clinical and bacteriological outcome but the results are limited by the small number of patients. A randomized trial in women with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis indicated that those treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole had a clinical and bacteriological success rate that was significantly lower in those patients treated with this drug when the infecting organism was resistant compared to those in whom the organism was susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

Conclusions

Resistance rates among common uropathogens continue to evolve and appear to be increasing to many commonly used agents. Continued surveillance of resistance rates among uropathogens is needed to ensure that appropriate recommendations can be made for treatment of infected patients. Further studies addressing the clinical and bacteriological outcomes of patients infected with a resistant pathogen are needed.

### Urinary tract infections in pregnancy [^182b3ddf]. Current Opinion in Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are very common during pregnancy. Escherichia coli is the most common pathogen isolated from pregnant women. Ampicillin should not be used because of its high resistance to Escherichia coli. Pyelonephritis can cause morbidity and can be life-threatening to both mother and fetus. Second and third-generation cephalosporins are recommended for treatment, administered initially intravenously during hospitalization. Cultures and the study of virulence factors of uropathogenic Escherichia coli are recommended for the adequate management of pyelonephritis. The lower genital tract infection associated with pyelonephritis is responsible for the failure of antibiotic treatment. Asymptomatic bacteriuria can evolve into cystitis or pyelonephritis. All pregnant women should be routinely screened for bacteriuria using urine culture, and should be treated with nitrofurantoin, sulfixosazole or first-generation cephalosporins. Recurrent urinary infection should be treated with prophylactic antibiotics. Pregnant women who develop urinary tract infections with group B streptococcal infection should be treated with prophylactic antibiotics during labour to prevent neonatal sepsis. Preterm delivery is frequent. Evidence suggests that infection plays a role in the pathogenesis of preterm labour. Experimental models in pregnant mice support the theory that Escherichia coli propagated by the transplacental route, involving bacterial adhesins, induces preterm delivery, but this has not been demonstrated in humans. Ascending lower genital tract infections are the most probable cause of preterm delivery, but this remains to be proved.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^431bc876]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Challenges do arise, however, around the possibility of applying metagenomic techniques to routine practice. In addition to potential uropathogens, these approaches identify a diversity of nonpathogenic commensals, greatly complicating reporting and interpretation on a case-by-case basis. From the perspective of the urobiome, low-level ASB may be viewed as a physiologic norm instead of an outlying phenomenon, and No Growth Observed should no longer be considered a universal reference value. Complicating matters further, many of the species now viewed as emerging uropathogens can be detected in both subjects with and without UTI symptoms. Important avenues of research have emerged around the human urobiome, including how its population structure differs between individuals, evolves over time, and impacts other urologic conditions. In this light, the presence/abundance of certain species may be variably associated with clinical symptomatology, as modified by host factors and other commensals. This "pathobiome" view of the urinary tract is far more nuanced than the traditional binary relationship between organism and disease (i.e. presence = infection, absence = health). While standardized methods for urobiome characterization have been proposed, these techniques have not supplanted traditional cultures within most clinical laboratories. As with other areas of the microbiome, outstanding questions remain on how urobiome data can be leveraged in a manner that is both evidence-based, as well as in the context of personalized care.

### Urinary tract infections revisited [^d43d4849]. Kidney International (2007). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) remain a significant clinical problem, despite antibiotic treatment and surgical correction of reflux and malformations. Here we propose that novel molecular tools may be applied to modernize and individualize the diagnosis and therapy of UTI. Determinants of bacterial virulence and host resistance are relatively well understood at the molecular level, and technology for their detection is within reach.

### Catheter-associated urinary tract infection [^616214f7]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is the commonest nosocomial infection worldwide. Here we review the recent advances in the prevention of CAUTI.

Recent Findings

After more than 30 years, new guidelines were issued in 2008–2011 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee and European Association of Urology. These guidelines addressed novel technologies such as silver alloy or antimicrobial coatings on catheters, hydrophilic catheters, urethral stents, use of sealed catheter-tube junctions and antiinfective bladder irrigation. In addition, multiple trials have been published recently on the reduction of inappropriate urinary tract catheterization.

Summary

Numerous strategies have been developed to reduce the incidence of CAUTI but few have proven effective. Reducing the inappropriate use of catheters and development of novel technologies targeted against these increasingly multidrug-resistant pathogens may be useful in the prevention of CAUTI in our vulnerable patients.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^4d972e55]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

What Is the Definition of cUTI?

cUTI is most usefully defined as children with UTI with an increased likelihood of failing conventional management (GRADE D).
Children with cUTI have one or more of: localized risk: significant anatomical or functional urological abnormality, multiple recurrent UTI, generalized risk: neonates, nonurological underlying condition (renal and nonrenal) and severe clinical presentations: sepsis, severe renal parenchymal disease.
We have used "complicated" to define subgroups at presentation and consequent management recommendations and "atypical" to refer to unexpected clinical progress (GRADE D).

The term "complicated UTI" has been used to describe multiple different UTI syndromes, with additional characteristics that might complicate the usual UTI course, variably including severe clinical presentations with or without extensive tissue involvement, hosts with abnormal urology or other underlying conditions and unusual pathogen properties. This variety makes it difficult to compare studies and provide consistent evidence in guidelines for the management of cUTI. UTI has traditionally been categorized as uncomplicated (uUTI) and complicated (cUTI) to standardize trial participants, but due to the lack of specific and clearly defined criteria at the outset, the definition has become increasingly broad and ambiguous. In a recent systematic review in adults, cUTI was variably defined by host factors and systemic involvement, a combination of both or neither. In children, early attempts to define cUTI variably included all neonates, most children with pyelonephritis, children with known anatomical or functional abnormalities, extensive parenchymal involvement, septicemia, nosocomial acquisition, renal impairment and recent antibiotics. The limited number of pediatric studies addressing cUTI (Table S1, Supplemental Digital Content 1a, and 1b,), have used various definitions, from comprehensive to brief to single complication.– Regarding the cUTI definition in existing guidelines for childhood UTI management, the updated National Institute for Clinical Excellence guideline for childhood UTIand recent Canadianand Swissguidelines used varying combinations of severe presentation, renal issues and failure to improve in their definitions, while the Italian Society of Pediatric Nephrologyuses severe presentation as the only criterion.

### Innate immunity and genetic determinants of urinary tract infection susceptibility [^bb612be4]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The susceptibility to infection varies greatly, depending on the pathogen, exposure rate and individual. Genetic predisposition is essential, not just for rare monogenetic disorders but for common infections such as urinary tract infection (UTI), wherein disease-associated genetic variants primarily control the expression of genes involved in the antibacterial defense. Genetic determinants of UTI susceptibility work in concert with social and behavioural risk factors, structural or functional abnormalities, catheters, foreign bodies or surgery, all of which modify the penetrance of susceptibility genes. As the vast majority of UTI-prone patients lack such risk factors, genetic predisposition is a major determinant of UTI morbidity.

UTI susceptibility runs in families and UTI-prone individuals experience recurrent, often clustered infections with potentially severe complications, depending on the site of infection and type of UTI. In three-generation family pedigrees, an increased frequency of acute pyelonephritis (APN) was detected in both male and female family members of APN-prone children, compared with children without UTI. There was no evidence of increased cystitis morbidity in those families, suggesting that different genetic mechanisms control APN and cystitis susceptibility. Several studies have associated personal and family histories of UTI with an increased risk of acute cystitis, and in one study, 42% of family members were cystitis-prone, compared with 11% of controls. The risk increased with the number of affected individuals, especially if a sister, mother or daughter had a history of UTI and the influence of behavioural factors was increased, consistent with a combined effect of genetics and exposure variables.

### Treatment of urinary tract infections in children… [^92699454]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection is common in children, especially in young girls. UTI is present in about 5 percent of febrile infants and 2 percent of febrile children younger than 5 years of age. Infection confined to the lower urinary tract can recur, but it is generally not associated with long-term complications. However, infections of the upper urinary tract can cause permanent scarring and renal damage. Hoberman and Wald describe the defining characteristics of both types of infection, along with the recommended management for each. Escherichia coli is the causative organism in approximately 85 percent of infants and young children with UTI. Other pathogens include gram-negative bacteria such as Proteus species, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Gram-positive organisms, which are rarely involved in routine pediatric UTIs, include enterococci, staphylococci and group B streptococci.

Cystitis is characterized by dysuria, urgency, frequency and pain in the lower abdomen. Fever is less common. Oral antibiotics, including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate and second-and third-generation cephalosporins, are usually effective. However. More than 60 percent of young febrile patients with UTI have evidence of pyelonephritis. Febrile infants with UTI who are younger than one year of age generally require hospitalization and initial treatment with intravenous antibiotics until afebrile, followed by oral therapy for 10 to 14 days. Appropriate intravenous agents include cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, ampicillin-sulbactam and gentamicin. Oral therapy depends on bacterial isolation and sensitivity. Recent studies question the need for long courses of intravenous cefotaxime when a short course of intravenous cefixime followed by oral therapy yields comparable results.

The authors conclude that treatment of UTI with oral antibiotics is usually effective, even in younger children with pyelonephritis. Cefixime is a useful empiric choice. Children who appear toxic or who cannot tolerate oral medication should be hospitalized for initial intravenous therapy. Radiographic studies can be performed before completion of antibiotic therapy. Caretakers should be educated about the risk of recurrence and advised when to seek medical attention.

### The diagnosis and treatment of adult urinary tract infections in the emergency department [^b4c73bf9]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Emergency medicine has been called the art of "making complicated clinical decisions with limited information". This description is particularly relevant in the case of diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Although common, UTIs are often challenging to diagnose given the presence of non-specific signs and symptoms and over-reliance on laboratory findings. This review provides an interdisciplinary interpretation of the primary literature and practice guidelines, with a focus on diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship in the emergency department.

### Diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections in children [^4e6bb0e5]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Acute urinary tract infections are relatively common in children, with 8 percent of girls and 2 percent of boys having at least one episode by seven years of age. The most common pathogen is Escherichia coli, accounting for approximately 85 percent of urinary tract infections in children. Renal parenchymal defects are present in 3 to 15 percent of children within one to two years of their first diagnosed urinary tract infection. Clinical signs and symptoms of a urinary tract infection depend on the age of the child, but all febrile children two to 24 months of age with no obvious cause of infection should be evaluated for urinary tract infection (with the exception of circumcised boys older than 12 months). Evaluation of older children may depend on the clinical presentation and symptoms that point toward a urinary source (e.g., leukocyte esterase or nitrite present on dipstick testing; pyuria of at least 10 white blood cells per high-power field and bacteriuria on microscopy). Increased rates of E. coli resistance have made amoxicillin a less acceptable choice for treatment, and studies have found higher cure rates with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Other treatment options include amoxicillin/clavulanate and cephalosporins. Prophylactic antibiotics do not reduce the risk of subsequent urinary tract infections, even in children with mild to moderate vesicoureteral reflux. Constipation should be avoided to help prevent urinary tract infections. Ultrasonography, cystography, and a renal cortical scan should be considered in children with urinary tract infections.

UTIs

In the United States, UTIs account for approximately 0.9% of all outpatient and emergency department visits and nearly 8% of all hospitalizations. Catheter-associated UTIs are the second most common cause of healthcare-related infections in the United States. The vast majority of uncomplicated infections, recurrent UTIs, and cases of pyelonephritis, and around one third of catheter-associated infections in the United States are caused by ExPEC (Table 1).

Table 1.
Burden of Extraintestinal Pathogenic Escherichia coli Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) in the United States

Rising prevalence of strains that are resistant to first-line oral agents such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, and fluoroquinolones has been documented globally among E. coli UTI isolates. Hospital admissions for UTIs increased by 50% in the United States between 2000 and 2009. However, hospital admissions caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)–producing E. coli increased by 300%, illustrating the growing burden and healthcare-related costs due to ExPEC and the urgent need for effective interventions.

### Diagnosis and management of urinary tract infection in older adults [^eaf8c16b]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a commonly diagnosed infection in older adults. Despite consensus guidelines developed to assist providers in diagnosing UTI, distinguishing symptomatic UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in older adults is problematic, as many older adults do not present with localized genitourinary symptoms. This article summarizes the recent literature and guidelines on the diagnosis and management of UTI and ASB in older adults.

### State-of-the-art review: recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^edb6fcbe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Over 50% of adult women experience at least 1 urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, and almost one-quarter of them will experience a recurrent UTI (rUTI). Recurrent UTI is defined as ≥ 2 UTIs in a 6-month period or ≥ 3 UTIs in 12 months (at least 1 of these episodes should be culture-proven to confirm infectious etiology). In this narrative review, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment considerations for recurrent uncomplicated cystitis in the adult female population. We provide a focused overview of the comprehensive management of these patients, with input from infectious disease physicians, urogynecologists, and urologists with expertise in rUTI, highlighting updated recommendations by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, American Urologic Association, Canadian Urologic Association, and American Urogynecologic Society. Finally, given the variety of prevention strategies, different treatment goals, and the need for "preference sensitive" decisions, we highlight the need for shared decision-making with patients.

### Contemporary management of urinary tract infection in children [^dc6e3b21]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children, and girls are at a significantly higher risk, as compared to boys, except in early infancy. Most cases are caused by Escherichia coli Collection of an uncontaminated urine specimen is essential for accurate diagnosis. Oral antibiotic therapy for 7 to 10 days is adequate for uncomplicated cases that respond well to the treatment. A renal ultrasound examination is advised in all young children with first febrile UTI and in older children with recurrent UTI. Most children with first febrile UTI do not need a voiding cystourethrogram; it may be considered after the first UTI in children with abnormal renal and bladder ultrasound examination or a UTI caused by atypical pathogen, complex clinical course, or known renal scarring. Long-term antibiotic prophylaxis is used selectively in high-risk patients. Few patients diagnosed with vesicoureteral reflux after a UTI need surgical correction. The most consequential long-term complication of acute pyelonephritis is renal scarring, which may increase the risk of hypertension or chronic kidney disease later in life. Treatment of acute pyelonephritis with an appropriate antibiotic within 48 hours of fever onset and prevention of recurrent UTI lowers the risk of renal scarring. Pathogens causing UTI are increasingly becoming resistant to commonly used antibiotics, and their indiscriminate use in doubtful cases of UTI must be discouraged.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® urinary tract infection-child: 2023 update [^fe5223d0]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequent infection in childhood. The diagnosis is usually made by history and physical examination and confirmed by urine analysis. Cystitis is infection or inflammation confined to the bladder, whereas pyelonephritis is infection or inflammation of kidneys. Pyelonephritis can cause renal scarring, which is the most severe long-term sequela of UTI and can lead to accelerated nephrosclerosis, leading to hypertension and chronic renal failure. The role of imaging is to guide treatment by identifying patients who are at high risk to develop recurrent UTIs or renal scarring. This document provides initial imaging guidelines for children presenting with first febrile UTI with appropriate response to medical management, atypical or recurrent febrile UTI, and follow-up imaging for children with established vesicoureteral reflux. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### CQUIN audit for prescription of antibiotics for urinary tract infections in an acute medical assessment unit [^f87549c5]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common diagnosis in medical admissions unit. NHS Choices states that around half of all UK women will have a UTI at least once in their lives and one in 2000 healthy men will have one at least once a year. There is a higher mortality and morbidity associated with UTIs in critically ill patients, and it is important that UTIs are treated promptly and adequately.

Moreover, numerous studies have shown an increasing resistance to several common antibiotics; of note in 2001 the first international survey of prevalence and susceptibility of organisms causing uncomplicated UTIs in the community (ECO-SENS Project), found that 42% E. coli isolated (accounting for 77% of pathogens cultured) was resistant to one or more of the more common antibiotics. The microbiology departments of hospital Trusts develop guidelines on first and second line antibiotics to treat infections based on local organisms and sensitivities.

### Urinary tract infection in geriatric and institutionalized patients [^0cc44464]. Current Opinion in Urology (2002). Low credibility.

The importance of urinary tract infection in elderly populations and some of the unique features in its evaluation and therapy are becoming better recognized. In elderly populations in the community there are concerns about increasing antimicrobial resistance in infecting organisms. In postmenopausal women, the importance of vaginal estrogen deficiency as a factor which promotes urinary tract infection is becoming increasingly recognized, leading to therapeutic strategies other than antimicrobials. For elderly residents of long term care facilities, urinary tract infection is very common, and most frequent in those with the greatest functional impairment. Whilst it is recognized that asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated, the diagnosis of urinary tract infection in this population often presents a dilemma. In particular, the urine culture is useful only in excluding urinary tract infection, not in making a diagnosis of symptomatic infection. There has been a tendency to manage all clinical deterioration in long term care facility residents who have positive urine cultures as urinary tract infection, contributing to excess antimicrobial use and heightening the problem of antimicrobial resistance. Recently published guidelines and commentaries attempt to address this problem.

### Endemic and epidemic lineages of Escherichia coli that cause urinary tract infections [^5b4e8fff]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Community-acquired extraintestinal infections with Escherichia coli range in frequency from 6 to 8 million cases of uncomplicated cystitis per year to 127,500 cases of sepsis per year in the United States. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by E. coli are one of the most common extraintestinal infections in women and, because of their high incidence, are the focus of most epidemiologic studies. The source of E. coli for these infections is a person's intestinal tract; however, how these E. coli are acquired by the gut is unclear. Risk factors that lead to intestinal colonization with extraintestinal E. coli differ from factors associated with development of infection.

Young, otherwise healthy, sexually active women have the highest risk for community-acquired UTIs. The main risk factors for UTI are recent and frequent sexual intercourse, contraceptive use, and a history of UTIs. Treatment for UTIs usually involves a short course of an antimicrobial drug, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ). Over the past decade, the prevalence of drug resistance in E. coli has increased dramatically, complicating management of these infections. Across the United States and Canada, urinary tract isolates of E. coli from outpatient clinics showed increased resistance to TMP-SMZ and ampicillin. A more serious concern has been the gradual increase in fluoroquinolone (e.g. ciprofloxacin) resistance among UTI isolates.

### Current antibiotic resistance patterns of rare uropathogens: survey from central European urology department 2011–2019 [^d96c96e9]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

With approximately 150–250 million cases occurring globally per year, urinary tract infections (UTIs) represent some of the most common infectious diseases in humans. Gram-negative enteric bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp. are their most common causative agents. UTIs occur more frequently among women than in men: 50% of females will experience at least one UTI in their lifetime. Recurrences are common and besides associated morbidity, UTIs put pressure on health care systems, too. While the cost of treatment of a single UTI episode is insignificant, their frequent incidence means they consume a non-negligible part of the health care budget: in France alone, the expense for adult female UTIs amounted to 58 million euro in 2012. Complicated UTIs are even more costly: one episode of a complicated UTI costs between 4028 and 7740 euro depending on the health care system.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become a major concern threathening many an advance of medicine in the twenty-first century. Uropathogenic microorganisms are no exception to this: rates of AMR among Enterobacteriaceae are increasing globally, albeit with temporal and spatial differences. Antibiotic consumption is a primary driver for the spread of AMR as evidenced on local and country levels. For instance, southern European states exhibit higher AMR rates than northern ones. Of note, four top antibiotic prescribers in Europe (Greece, Cyprus, France and Italy) belong among south European countries.

International guidelines for UTI treatment are freely available; yet, poor antibiotic prescription remains common. Thirty percent of primary care antibiotic prescriptions were inadequate in a report from the United States. Appropriate antibiotic treatment was reported in 68% of adult cystitis cases and only 46% of pyelonephritis cases in another survey.

### Evaluation and treatment of urinary tract infections in children… [^536ebc89]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection is defined as the presence of bacteria in urine along with symptoms of infection. UTIs occur in as many as 5 percent of girls and 1 to 2 percent of boys. 1 The incidence of UTI in infants ranges from approximately 0. 1 to

1. 0 percent in all newborn infants to as high as 10 percent in low-birth-weight infants. 2 Infection of the urinary tract before age one occurs more frequently in boys than in girls. 2 After age one, both bacteriuria and UTI are more common in girls. Etiology and Pathogenesis Escherichia coli is the most common infecting pathogen in children, accounting for up to 80 percent of UTIs. Other pathogens include Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species, a variety of enterobacteria and, occasionally, Candida albicans. The virulence of the invading bacteria and the susceptibility of the host are of primary importance in the development of UTI.

3 In neonates, the usual route of infection is presumed to be hematogenous. 1 Later in life, infection is usually caused by ascension of bacteria into the urinary tract. 5 Any condition that leads to urinary stasis may predispose to the development of UTI in children. 11 The fact that renal scarring develops in only a minority of patients with pyelonephritis and/or vesicoureteral reflux suggests that the development of renal scarring likely involves the interplay of several factors and cannot simply be attributed to the presence of infection or reflux alone. Most UTIs are caused by a single organism; the presence of two or more organisms usually suggests contamination. A urine culture is not mandatory in adolescent girls, particularly with a first episode. With recurrent episodes, episodes that fail therapy and in girls with pyuria without bacteriuria, a culture is recommended.

Breakthrough UTI Breakthrough UTI may be caused by a change in the resistance pattern of organisms colonizing the urethra, noncompliance, vesicoureteral reflux or voiding dysfunction. Recognizing and addressing these associated factors are essential in treating breakthrough UTI. A study in girls showed that treatment of voiding dysfunction combined with double antimicrobial prophylaxis was significantly successful in preventing breakthrough UTI. 20.

### Development of predictive models to inform a novel risk categorization framework for antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli-caused uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^35983055]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common outpatient infections in the United States (US), with an estimated lifetime incidence of 50%‒60% in female adults. Approximately 80% of UTIs are classified as uncomplicated UTI (uUTI), which is one of the most common indications leading to antibiotic prescriptions in females. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend nitrofurantoin (NTF), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), and fosfomycin as first-line treatments, while antibiotics such as β-lactams and fluoroquinolones are recommended as alternative options. Despite guideline recommendations, prescribing practices not aligned with IDSA guidelines are common, with 86.1% of patients prescribed alternative antibiotic agents as first-line therapy. These inappropriate prescribing practices contribute to increased healthcare costs and development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which leads to treatment failure, persistent uUTI symptoms, and adverse events.

Approximately 80% of uUTIs are caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli), and rising prevalence of AMR is a growing concern. A recent US study of urinary E. coli isolates from female outpatients ≥ 12 years of age found that 25.4%, 21.1%, and 3.8% were nonsusceptible to SXT, fluoroquinolones, and NTF, respectively, and 6.4% had extended-spectrum β-lactamase production. In clinical practice, challenges in identifying patients with uUTI at risk of having a nonsusceptible isolate to commonly prescribed antibiotics can lead to inappropriate empiric prescribing. One novel method to help inform empiric prescribing by clinicians in uUTI is using a data-driven approach, such as predictive modeling, to identify patients at higher risk of having a nonsusceptible isolate to commonly prescribed antibiotics, thereby facilitating improved empiric prescribing practices in uUTI and mitigating development of AMR. Recently, predictive modeling has been used to identify important factors that contribute to risk of nonsusceptibility to antibiotic treatments for uUTI. To date, none have developed a corresponding risk categorization framework that contextualizes different AMR risk profiles.

To address this gap, this study developed and validated predictive models to estimate probabilities of E. coli nonsusceptibility to 4 commonly prescribed classes of antibiotic treatments for uUTI, identified key predictors of nonsusceptibility to the 4 classes of antibiotic treatments, and constructed a novel risk categorization framework for nonsusceptibility to the 4 classes of antibiotic treatments.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^d0fc31ab]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Future directions for recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — the guideline highlights that A better understanding of rUTI pathophysiology will greatly aid in our ability to design more effective, mechanistically-based treatments, that Relying on results from the urinary dipstick test, including leukocyte esterase and nitrate, lacks the necessary level of sensitivity and specificity for diagnostic accuracy, and that Currently, there are no symptoms that are definitively predictive of acute cystitis, and no good quality evidence that can support a specific pathogen. It states Urine culture results or any other current methods of bacterial detection do not reflect any aspect of the host response and calls for defining initiatives for algorithms to predict treatment and partnering with our primary care colleagues and patients to provide education regarding rUTI definitions, evaluation, and treatment. It notes Advanced molecular technologies give a more complete characterization of genitourinary microbes and that PCR and NGS-based diagnostic tests have some enticing preliminary studies suggesting their utilization may facilitate equivalent or even better clinical outcomes than standard urine culture while decreasing the time to diagnosis and reducing empiric antibiotic prescriptions, while cautioning These early studies, however, are complicated by some methodological limitations and a high risk of bias and More data are needed before identifying what role these tests play in UTI diagnostics.

### Urinary catheter-associated infections [^bfc9cb63]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on catheter-associated urinary tract infection:

- **Definition**: CA-UTI is a common hospital-acquired infection characterized by various medical complications such as catheter encrustation, bladder stones, septicemia, endotoxic shock, and pyelonephritis.
- **Pathophysiology**: Colonization of the urinary catheter and/or uroepithelial cells, evasion of host defenses, replication, and damage to host cells by uropathogens are involved in the development of CA-UTI. Common microbiological agents include E. coli, P. mirabilis, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, K. pneumoniae, P. vulgaris, C. freundii, Providentia rettgeri, and C. albicans.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include fever, urethritis, cystitis, acute pyelonephritis, renal scarring, calculus formation, and bacteremia. Disease progression may lead to urosepsis and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Several studies report an association between catheter-associated infection, increased mortality, and prolonged length of stay in acute care facilities.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^82f94cf0]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Practice considerations — population and definition: This recommendation applies to adults 18 years and older and pregnant persons of any age without signs and symptoms of a urinary tract infection and does not apply to persons who have chronic medical or urinary tract conditions, such as end-stage renal disease; have neurogenic bladders, urinary stents, or spinal cord injuries; are hospitalized; reside in an institution (e.g., a nursing home); or who are transplant recipients. Asymptomatic bacteriuria occurs when the urinary tract is colonized with significant amounts of pathogenic bacteria, primarily from the gastrointestinal tract, in the absence of symptoms or signs of a urinary tract infection; the most common pathogen is Escherichia coli, although other bacteria such as Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis, and group B streptococcus can be involved. The risk of developing asymptomatic bacteriuria varies by age, sex, and pregnancy status; because of the location and length of the female urethra, women are predisposed to infections of the urinary tract, in general, men are at low risk of developing asymptomatic bacteriuria, and persons with diabetes are also at increased risk of developing asymptomatic bacteriuria.

### Waterborne urinary tract infections: have we overlooked an important source of exposure? [^a359a07c]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

The presence of intestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli in drinking water is well recognized as a risk for diarrhea. The role of drinking water in extraintestinal infections caused by E. coli-such as urinary tract infections (UTIs)-remains poorly understood. Urinary tract infections are a leading cause of outpatient infections globally, with a lifetime incidence of 50–60% in adult women. We reviewed the scientific literature on the occurrence of uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) in water supplies to determine whether the waterborne route may be an important, overlooked, source of UPEC. A limited number of studies have assessed whether UPEC isolates are present in drinking water supplies, but no studies have measured whether their presence in water may increase UPEC colonization or the risk of UTIs in humans. Given the prevalence of drinking water supplies contaminated with E. coli across the globe, efforts should be made to characterize UTI-related risks associated with drinking water, as well as other pathways of exposure.

### Improving catheter associated urinary tract infection rates in the medical units [^5631508a]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

CAUTI is one of the most common healthcare associated infections. It is a leading cause of secondary blood stream infection resulting in increased morbidity and mortality with an estimated 13,000 attributable deaths annually, increased length of stay by 2–4 days and increased healthcare costs with additional cost $1200–2400 per case. Overuse of indwelling urinary catheters (15–20% of hospitalized patients) contributes to the frequency of hospital associated urinary tract infections and the duration of urinary catheterization is the single most important risk factor for developing CAUTI (each day an indwelling urinary catheter remains the patient has a 5% increased risk of developing CAUTI). Urinary catheters are commonly placed for inappropriate indications and healthcare providers are often unaware that their patients have catheters leading to prolonged unnecessary use. Up to 60% of CAUTI are considered preventable; provided that recommended evidence based infection-prevention practices are implemented. Guidelines for the prevention of CAUTI recommend appropriate catheter use, aseptic insertion, use of closed drainage systems, proper maintenance and timely removal of indwelling urinary catheters, as well as the use of established practices such as hand hygiene. Prevention strategies must focus on clear indications for the insertion of urinary catheter, proper maintenance while in use and early catheter removal.

### Global prevalence of antibiotic resistance in paediatric urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and association with routine use of antibiotics in primary care: systematic review and meta-analysis [^a24a48ff]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Antimicrobial resistance is an internationally recognised threat to health. The contribution of primary healthcare is particularly important as this is where almost 80% of all antibiotics used within the health service are prescribed. Bacterial infections resistant to antibiotics can limit the availability of effective treatment options, rendering some commonly encountered bacterial infections difficult to treat, including those of the urinary tract. Antibiotic resistant infections are also twice as likely to be associated with greater morbidity and mortality and are associated with increased healthcare costs. In low income countries, affordability of second line drugs and reduced access to healthcare can restrict the use of newer broad spectrum antibiotics, resulting in growing concerns for increased morbidity and mortality from antibiotic resistant infections in these countries.

Children receive a lot of primary healthcare services and, as such, receive a disproportionately high number of antibiotics compared with middle aged populations. Children are also key drivers of infection within communities and can contribute to the spread of bacteria from person to person. Despite this, little research has been published describing the prevalence of bacterial resistance in children or the risk factors of importance in this group. In 2010, Costelloe and colleagues conducted a systematic review that reported strong associations between previous exposure to routinely prescribed antibiotics in primary care and antimicrobial resistance persisting for up to 12 months. Most of the contributing studies, however, were conducted in adults.

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common bacterial infections seen in primary care. In children with a suspected urinary tract infection, the most common management strategy is to treat empirically with an antibiotic while results of culture and sensitivity testing are awaited. Young children are more vulnerable to immediate and long term complications, including renal scarring and renal failure, and therefore require prompt appropriate treatment. Escherichia coli is responsible for over 80% of all urinary tract infectionsand is also the most common cause of bacteraemia and foodborne infections and a cause of meningitis in neonates.

We conducted a systematic review to investigate the prevalence of resistance in community acquired E coli urinary tract infection to the most commonly prescribed antibiotics given to children in primary care and to quantify the relation between previous exposure to antibiotics in primary care and bacterial resistance. We stratified results by OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) status of the study countries as antibiotics tend to be used differently in these groups. In the more developed OECD countries antibiotics are obtained mostly only by prescription, whereas in "developing" non-OECD countries many antibiotics, including those commonly used to treat urinary tract infection, can be obtained over the counter, without the need for a prescription.

### Candiduria [^d7dd9523]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Candiduria is a common finding. Yeasts can be detected in urine that is contaminated during collection, in patients who have bladder colonization, and in patients who have upper urinary tract infection that developed either from retrograde spread from the bladder or hematogenous spread from a distant source. Most patients with candiduria are asymptomatic. The rate of development of complications is not known but appears to be low; candidemia rarely results from asymptomatic candiduria unless obstruction is present or instrumentation of the urinary tract is done. Unfortunately, there are no established diagnostic tests that reliably distinguish infection from colonization. Guidelines for the treatment of candiduria, based almost entirely on anecdotal reports and expert opinions, rather than controlled clinical trials, have been suggested by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Until reliable methods to distinguish infection from colonization are developed, further treatment trials are unlikely to provide information to guide the clinician in the treatment of candiduria.

### Urinary tract infection and asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults [^6b6dbb1b]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a significant cause of morbidity among older adults. However, antibiotic prescriptions for clinically suspected UTIs are often inappropriate. Health care providers frequently struggle to differentiate UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria, particularly in patients presenting with nonspecific symptoms. Patients with baseline cognitive impairments that limit history-taking can be particularly challenging. This article reviews the epidemiology and pathogenesis of UTI in older adults. It discusses an approach to diagnosis and treatment focused on recognizing patients who would likely benefit from antibiotic treatment and on identifying patients for whom empiric antibiotic therapy should not be given.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^99949f99]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Cystitis and pyelonephritis — quantitative urine culture thresholds and test utilization specify that the standardized threshold in symptomatic patients is > 100 000 CFU/mL for organisms identified as common pathogens, though many sites now use either 10 000 CFU/mL or 1000 CFU/mL based on the method of collection or patient population as a baseline for culture workup and clinical significance. Laboratories typically provide antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) for potential pathogens recovered in significant gram numbers as part of standard laboratory protocol. The Gram stain is not routinely utilized for the diagnosis of uncomplicated urinary tract infection, but it may have limited utility in patients with febrile urinary tract infection (pyelonephritis, prostatitis, urosepsis) where high numbers of gram-negative bacilli may be present in urine screen. Because urine may be readily contaminated with urogenital microbiota, proper specimen collection is essential for urine culture and should be performed using a process that minimizes contamination from the perineal and superficial mucosal microbiota.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^55b5409c]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — definition and diagnostic criteria emphasize that this Guideline supports the most commonly used definition of two episodes of acute bacterial cystitis within a six-month period sometime within the preceding year, and any patient experiencing episodes of symptomatic acute cystitis after previous resolution of similar symptoms meets the criteria for rUTI. Strong evidence suggests that the diagnosis of acute bacterial cystitis should include the combination of acute-onset symptoms referable to the urinary tract, urinary inflammation on microscopic urinalysis (pyuria), and laboratory confirmation of significant bacteriuria, with Table 1 detailing components such as acute-onset symptoms including dysuria with increased urgency and frequency, hematuria, and new or worsening incontinence; urinary tract inflammation defined as pyuria ≥ 5 WBC/high power field (hpf) on microscopic urinalysis; and detection of a bacterial uropathogen. Without symptoms, bacteriuria of any magnitude is considered asymptomatic bacteriuria, and patients who recur rapidly within two weeks of initial treatment or who display bacterial persistence without symptom resolution may require imaging, cystoscopy, or other further investigation for bacterial reservoirs.

### Diagnosis and management of UTI in febrile infants age 0–2 months: applicability of the AAP guideline [^3c420afb]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infection in young infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics' (AAP) clinical practice guideline for UTIs focuses on febrile children age 2–24 months, with no guideline for infants < 2 months of age, an age group commonly encountered by pediatric hospitalists. In this review, we assess the applicability of the AAP UTI Guideline's action statements for previously healthy, febrile infants < 2 months of age. We also discuss additional considerations in this age group, including concurrent bacteremia and routine testing for meningitis.

### Innate immunity and genetic determinants of urinary tract infection susceptibility [^712c223c]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

URINARY TRACT INFECTION SUSCEPTIBILITY AND FUTURE RISK

Assessing UTI susceptibility and selecting appropriate therapeutic interventions is essential, in view of the high prevalence of UTIs and their significance to health and society. UTIs are common, encountered at all levels of healthcare whether primary or tertiary and consume considerable healthcare costs. It is estimated that 40–50% of women and 5% of men worldwide will develop UTI at least once in their lifetime, and UTIs account for more than 1 million hospitalizations and $1.6 billion in medical expenses annually, in the USA. UTIs also cause premature delivery and perinatal mortality, chronic renal disease and renal failure, unless properly treated. UTIs have an incidence of 5% in children less than 12 years old. Up to 30% of children with APN developed renal scars following UTI and this process is associated with long-term morbidity such as hypertension, complications of pregnancy and renal failure if scarring is extensive. Thus, the disease burden of UTI is significant, if not optimally managed.

Yet, the management of these patients remains unsatisfactory. Despite the urgent need, molecular tools are not used routinely to identify individuals at risk, resulting in a worldwide lack of consensus and uniform tools. Selection criteria for further radiological imaging and invasive fluoroscopy will thus remain unclear, guided only by best practices. The genes discussed above are biomarkers of UTI susceptibility or resistance. It is time to start including genetic markers in the daily risk assessment in UTI-prone patients to validate genes or gene combinations with optimal predictive power in the different UTI-prone patient groups.

### Urinary tract pathogens and resistance pattern [^1ea0a4fb]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Epidemiology and resistance patterns of bacterial pathogens in paediatric urinary tract infections (UTIs) show large inter-regional variability, and rates of bacterial resistance are changing due to different antibiotic treatment. Empiric therapy to treat UTI should be tailored to the surveillance data on the epidemiology and resistance patterns of common uropathogens to reduce treatment failures and emergence of bacterial resistance within the community.

Objective

A retrospective data review was carried out to evaluate the resistance patterns to commonly used antibiotics in children with culture proven UTIs.

Methods

All infants and children with culture proven UTI from 2002 to 2008 were included. Urine culture was deemed positive with a pure growth > 10(5) (single organism).

Results

A total of 547 UTIs were confirmed on urine cultures in 337 patients. An average of 78 cases were diagnosed each year. E coli was the most commonly grown pathogen (92%). From 2002 to 2008, rising resistance patterns were noted for trimethoprim (p ≤ 0.05) and Augmentin (p ≤ 0.001). In contrast, resistance to cefalexin and nitrofurantoin remained relatively low (11% and 7%, respectively, in 2008).

Conclusion

Our data suggest that there has been an increasing resistance trend to the first-line antibiotics like trimethoprim and Augmentin against E coli. In accordance with NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) guidance, each region should monitor resistance patterns to urinary pathogens on a regular basis and use antibiotics with a low resistance pattern. Further studies are required from other centres in the UK to look at similar data.
