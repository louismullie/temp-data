## Question

Abdominal pain after hernia surgery

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing abdominal pain after hernia surgery. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify the pain by time course and severity. Then, I should verify the key risk factors and likely etiologies. Next, I will outline a staged diagnostic approach, followed by a stepwise management algorithm. Finally, I need to consider special scenarios and prevention, and close with a concise decision pathway that aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the temporal framework and definitions, because mislabeling early pain as chronic can misdirect management. Chronic postoperative pain is generally defined as pain persisting beyond 3 months after surgery, though some hernia-specific expert groups extend the threshold to 6 months to account for ongoing mesh-related inflammation that may improve between 3 and 6 months, so I should explicitly ask when the pain began and how it has evolved over time [^113i5SEq] [^112F1G4B] [^112iqKBf].

> I need to check severity and functional impact next, since "moderate pain impacting daily activities" is the clinically meaningful threshold in hernia guidelines and helps prioritize escalation. I should quantify pain with a validated scale and screen for interference with work, sleep, and activities, because this stratifies patients into mild, moderate, or severe categories and guides urgency and modality of treatment [^112F1G4B].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify risk factors that predict chronicity to set expectations and tailor counseling. Younger age, female sex, high preoperative pain intensity, severe early postoperative pain, open anterior repair, penetrating fixation, and postoperative complications independently increase the risk of chronic pain after inguinal hernia repair, and similar principles apply to ventral hernia repairs with additional contributions from chronic cough and fixation-related issues [^116DKDD7] [^114FYjd6] [^116SuTLi] [^115emfTe].

> Let me consider the etiologies systematically, because treatment hinges on identifying the dominant mechanism. Neuropathic pain from ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, or genital branch injury is common, nociceptive pain can arise from mesh inflammation or a meshoma, mechanical pain may reflect fixation tension or suture/tack irritation, and recurrence can masquerade as persistent pain. Less commonly, mesh erosion or migration can cause focal pain and even bowel complications, so I should keep a broad differential and correlate with exam and imaging when indicated [^1125GcEa] [^115BUMqD] [^1138dJYT].

> Next, I should review the initial evaluation steps. I will start with a focused history mapping pain quality, triggers, radiation, and timing, followed by a meticulous physical exam including inspection for bulge, palpation for focal tenderness or a neuroma, and a Carnett test to screen for abdominal wall pain. If I suspect recurrence or a mesh-related complication, targeted ultrasound is reasonable, but CT is preferred when the exam is equivocal or when I need to evaluate for mesh position, erosion, or alternative intra-abdominal pathology [^111dEmsX] [^111VmaKa] [^116mgPb9].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging sequence so I don't overuse CT unnecessarily. Ultrasound is sensitive for recurrence and can guide injections, but CT provides definitive assessment of mesh position, fixation elements, and intra-abdominal complications. MRI can help in complex cases or when radiation avoidance is desired, so I should align modality with the suspected mechanism and pretest probability [^111VmaKa] [^116mgPb9].

> I will now examine the management algorithm for early postoperative pain, because preventing acute pain chronification is crucial. For the first 0–6 weeks, I should optimize multimodal analgesia with NSAIDs and acetaminophen, consider regional techniques such as TAP blocks or wound infiltration, and reserve opioids for breakthrough pain; I should also counsel on activity modification and constipation prevention to limit straining and protect the repair while avoiding unnecessary immobilization [^113mniGP] [^112CAC7v] [^113E8685].

> For subacute pain persisting beyond 6 weeks, I should double-check that I am not missing a recurrence or a mesh-related issue. Watchful waiting with reassurance is reasonable if pain is mild and improving, but I should escalate to gabapentinoids or TCAs if neuropathic features emerge, consider a diagnostic nerve block to distinguish neuropathic from mechanical pain, and obtain imaging if pain localizes to the repair site or fails to improve by 3 months [^111Lh6b5] [^113gfRpf] [^116mgPb9].

> For chronic pain beyond 3–6 months, I need to ensure a multidisciplinary approach and a stepwise escalation. Pharmacologic therapy with gabapentinoids, SNRIs, or TCAs is appropriate for neuropathic pain, and therapeutic ilioinguinal or iliohypogastric blocks can both diagnose and treat focal neuropathic sources; if pain remains refractory after 3–6 months of conservative therapy, I should discuss surgical options including targeted neurectomy, mesh removal, or both, tailoring the approach to the original repair and current anatomy [^113gfRpf] [^117ECq4A] [^114j4seS].

> But wait, what if the original repair was open anterior versus laparoscopic posterior? I should tailor surgery accordingly. After an anterior approach, an anterior triple neurectomy with mesh removal is favored, whereas after a posterior approach, laparoscopic exploration with tack and mesh removal and consideration of a retroperitoneal triple neurectomy is recommended; I should counsel that evidence quality is limited and that surgery carries risks of pain intensification or recurrence, so expectations must be carefully managed [^117ECq4A] [^1143Dqhy].

> I should confirm that I have addressed special scenarios that change urgency or strategy. Immediate severe postoperative pain should prompt evaluation for nerve injury or vascular compromise and may require early reoperation. Trocar-site hernia can present with acute pain and obstruction after laparoscopy and warrants urgent repair. In patients with bariatric surgery and intermittent severe pain, I must consider internal hernia and obtain CT, proceeding to diagnostic laparoscopy if imaging is nondiagnostic. And in ventral hernia repairs, fascial closure before mesh placement did not increase 3‑month pain in RCTs, which reassures me that anatomic restoration is reasonable when indicated [^113JH2Gy] [^11295wgQ] [^1146r72k] [^112ZL7fT].

> Let me reconsider prevention, because mitigating risk factors is as important as treating established pain. Laparoendoscopic techniques reduce chronic pain compared with open repairs when performed by experienced surgeons, lightweight meshes may reduce short-term pain after open inguinal repair but heavyweight meshes are preferred in laparoendoscopic repairs to balance recurrence risk, and atraumatic fixation with glue or selective nonfixation can reduce pain. Intraoperative nerve awareness and avoidance of penetrating fixation when feasible are key technical steps [^111PtSXb] [^11326pDd] [^117Q5aJX] [^114qx1JZ].

> I should double-check that my counseling and follow-up plan aligns with guidelines. Patients should be told that chronic pain occurs in roughly 10–12% after inguinal hernia repair and that a minority have severe pain requiring specialist input; a graded, time-based approach starting with watchful waiting, then pharmacologic therapy, then injections, and finally surgery is recommended, and persistent cases warrant referral to centers with hernia pain expertise to optimize outcomes [^114FYjd6] [^1177RrVf] [^1143Dqhy].

> In summary, I need to ensure my decision pathway remains explicit: classify pain by time course and severity. Screen for risk factors. Map likely etiologies with exam and selective imaging. Treat early pain aggressively to prevent chronification. Use a stepwise algorithm from watchful waiting to pharmacologic therapy to interventional blocks to surgery. Tailor operative choices to the index repair. And embed prevention strategies into preoperative planning and intraoperative technique, verifying each step against contemporary guidelines and the best available evidence before escalating care [^112F1G4B] [^114j4seS] [^116yfBfy].

Abdominal pain after hernia surgery is common and usually multifactorial, with **neuropathic pain from nerve injury** [^116yfBfy] and **mesh-related complications** (erosion, infection, migration) [^114WkCz7] as key causes [^1125GcEa]. Early pain is expected, but **persistent pain beyond 3 months** [^112F1G4B] warrants evaluation for recurrence, nerve entrapment, or mesh issues [^1125GcEa]. Management is stepwise: start with analgesics and physical therapy, escalate to nerve blocks or injections [^116rVYMd], and reserve surgery (neurectomy, mesh removal) for refractory cases [^1177RrVf] [^117ECq4A]. Risk factors include preoperative pain, female sex, younger age, open repair, and mesh fixation [^116DKDD7] [^114FYjd6]; prevention focuses on nerve awareness, atraumatic technique, and selective mesh fixation [^114qx1JZ] [^113fHehY].

## Etiology and pathophysiology

Abdominal pain after hernia surgery arises from **multiple mechanisms**:

- **Neuropathic pain**: Injury to the ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, or genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve [^115ZmVtX] causes burning, shooting, or allodynia [^notfound].

- **Mesh-related complications**: Mesh erosion, infection, migration, or shrinkage can cause persistent pain [^1125GcEa] [^1138dJYT].

- **Recurrent hernia**: Recurrence can cause pain due to repeated tissue disruption and nerve irritation [^1125GcEa].

- **Inflammatory response**: Chronic inflammation around mesh or sutures can perpetuate pain [^1125GcEa].

- **Mechanical factors**: Tension from mesh fixation or sutures can cause localized pain [^115dx8t3].

---

## Incidence and risk factors

The incidence of chronic pain after hernia surgery varies by technique and patient factors:

| **Hernia type** | **Incidence of chronic pain** | **Risk factors** |
|-|-|-|
| Inguinal hernia | 10–30% | - Preoperative pain <br/> - Female sex <br/> - Younger age <br/> - Open repair <br/> - Mesh fixation [^116DKDD7] [^114FYjd6] |
| Ventral/incisional hernia | 10–25% | - Preoperative pain <br/> - Mesh fixation <br/> - Recurrence [^116Ek7UY] [^116UvYPs] |

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnostic approach

A **structured evaluation** is essential:

- **History**: Characterize pain (onset, duration, quality, radiation), functional impact, and response to prior treatments [^1135xHQE].

- **Physical examination**: Look for focal tenderness, neuromas, hernia recurrence, or mesh prominence [^111dEmsX].

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound or CT can identify recurrence, mesh complications, or nerve entrapment [^116mgPb9].

- **Diagnostic nerve blocks**: Temporary relief with local anesthetic supports a neuropathic source [^111dEmsX].

---

## Management strategies

Management is **stepwise and multidisciplinary**:

### Non-surgical management

- **Pharmacologic therapy**: NSAIDs, gabapentinoids, TCAs, or SNRIs for neuropathic pain [^notfound].

- **Physical therapy**: Core strengthening and desensitization [^notfound].

- **Interventional procedures**: Nerve blocks, trigger point injections, or radiofrequency ablation [^115yEP86].

---

### Surgical management

Surgical options include **neurectomy** — triple neurectomy of the ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, and genital branch nerves for refractory neuropathic pain [^1165ovyo] — and **mesh removal**, indicated for mesh-related complications or refractory pain [^117ECq4A] [^1138dJYT]. Hernia recurrence should be repaired with attention to nerve preservation or neurectomy as indicated [^1125GcEa].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention focuses on **minimizing nerve injury** and **optimizing technique**:

- **Nerve awareness**: Identify and protect inguinal nerves during surgery [^114qx1JZ].

- **Atraumatic technique**: Gentle tissue handling and avoidance of excessive tension [^114e8w1h].

- **Mesh selection**: Lightweight meshes may reduce chronic pain in some settings [^11326pDd].

- **Fixation method**: Selective or non-penetrating fixation (e.g. glue) may reduce nerve injury risk [^112wsQZm].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies: many patients improve with conservative therapy, but a subset have persistent pain requiring interventional or surgical care. Early **multidisciplinary management** improves outcomes [^112TZE7B].

---

Abdominal pain after hernia surgery is common and multifactorial; **a structured, stepwise approach** — from conservative measures to targeted interventions — is key to effective management.

INITIAL EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT

The workup for a patient with concerns of a ventral abdominal wall or groin hernia begins with a thorough history and physical examination (Figs. 1). It is essential that the physical examination include all potential sites of abdominal wall hernia, including the groin and perineal areas, especially in patients with more vague presenting symptoms. Incarcerated hernias, especially in the groin, can be easily missed by a more superficial examination. After the diagnosis of a hernia has been made, the specific location, surgical history, associated symptoms, and patient-specific factors will help determine the appropriate next steps in management. History should focus on the duration of symptoms, prior episodes of hernia incarceration, past surgical history, and evidence of systemic signs of illness, including fever, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, or skin changes overlying the hernia. Physical examination should evaluate the location of the hernia, the size of the fascial defect, the presence of hernia incarceration, and any redness or ecchymosis of the overlying skin. For a well-defined localized fascial defect, adding imaging to the initial diagnostic workup is of unclear benefit and is not mandatory. If there are concerns for a complicated abdominal wall hernia, based on either patient factors or hernia variables, additional workup should be considered, and laboratory evaluation should be obtained to include a basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, and lactate.
The determination of the need and urgency for surgical repair will depend on multiple factors. Patients with a reducible hernia, improvement in symptoms, no evidence of complications, and an otherwise normal physical examination should be referred for outpatient surgical follow-up to discuss elective hernia repair. Patients with concern for abdominal wall hernia complications, including strangulation, intestinal obstruction, hernia incarceration, unrelieved severe pain, overlying skin changes, or evidence of systemic illness, should be seen by an acute care surgeon. Ideally, surgical evaluation should precede imaging in patients with nonreducible hernias and worrisome findings on physical examination.
Patients with an incarcerated hernia and concern for strangulation or presence of peritonitis require prompt surgical intervention, as increased time from onset of symptoms to operative intervention is associated with an increased need for bowel resection. Signs of bowel incarceration causing obstruction (nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, and obstipation), in addition to severe pain at the hernia site, are suggestive of strangulation. Systemic signs of strangulation may include hypotension and tachycardia, with elevations in serum lactate (> 2.0 mmol/L) and white blood cell often (although not definitively) found on initial laboratory evaluation. Physical examination may also show erythema or bruising/discoloration of the skin overlying the hernia. When these findings are present, or the patient is otherwise deemed at risk for strangulation within the hernia, an emergent exploration should be undertaken, with assessment of the viability of involved bowel, reduction of the hernia, and definitive hernia repair if practical. In many cases, imaging is not required and may lead to unnecessary delay. Similar to other EGS procedures, patients requiring acute urgent operation for hernia complications are at increased risk of complication compared with their elective counterparts.
In circumstances of diagnostic uncertainty or a difficult-to-interpret examination (as can be found in obesity), imaging should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and to evaluate for high-risk imaging features associated with strangulation. While ultrasound can be used to help with the initial diagnosis, cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography scan is preferred. Even when the diagnosis of hernia is confidently made on physical examination, computed tomography imaging can provide useful clinical information on the fascial defect size and hernia contents to evaluate for signs of intestinal obstruction or ischemia. In the absence of a high index of suspicion for strangulation, attempts should be made to reduce an incarcerated abdominal wall hernia unless it is known that the patient has had a chronically nonreducible incarcerated hernia. Acute hernia incarceration that is not reducible should prompt urgent operative intervention to reduce the hernia, evaluate for the viability of the incarcerated bowel, and repair the hernia defect.
Acutely incarcerated hernias that are reducible but have high-risk features (Table 1) on imaging or physical examination should favor urgent repair (defined as nonemergent but performed during the index admission). These features are related to the patient's presentation and imaging findings. Clinical high-risk features include persistent abdominal pain after reduction or persistent nausea/vomiting. Radiographic findings associated with a higher risk for hernia complications should be considered when determining the need for urgent surgery in patients without clear signs of strangulation. Beyond the typical signs of bowel ischemia (e.g. pneumatosis, portal venous gas, or free air), the presence of fluid within the hernia sac, a transition point of the bowel at the neck of the hernia, bowel thickening within the hernia, and inflammatory stranding in the tissue along the hernia are considered high-risk features.
While repair of a hernia on initial presentation may be ideal, patient factors or local capacity may not permit this to be reasonably performed in all settings. Patient-specific factors should be considered, including age, frailty, American Society of Anesthesia score, and preadmission anticoagulant use, as each of these variables is associated with an increased risk of complications. – Some patients with hernias that exhibit a higher risk of recurrence may be discharged but with a defined plan to repair it in the short term to minimize patients' loss of follow-up. Variables associated with a higher risk of recurrence include clinical factors and radiographic features of the hernia (Table 2). Acute onset and escalation of symptoms should be considered potential reasons to hasten repair. The need for conscious sedation to achieve a successful visceral reduction marks patients as higher risk, and they should undergo expedited repair (when performed within 4 weeks, reincarceration rates of ~2% have been reported). High-risk anatomical features include certain types of hernias with femoral and Spigelian hernias exhibiting a higher incarceration rate and need for emergent repair; therefore, these should be addressed promptly. Women with groin hernia have a higher risk of requiring emergent surgery compared with men, especially if a femoral hernia is present. The size of the fascial defect is an unreliable predictor of the need for urgent repair, but primary hernia defects between 3 and 4 cm are at higher overall risk of incarceration compared with smaller or larger defects (with a rate of 10%; odds ratio, 3.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.91–5.74; p < 0.0001). Specific measurements comparing the width of a fascial defect and the height of the hernia sack can also be used to estimate an increased risk with a "mushrooming hernia", one with a narrow neck as compared with height creating an acute angle with the abdominal wall being associated with a higher risk of requiring emergent surgery (odds ratio, 6.12; 95% confidence interval, 2.24–20.00). Similarly, a study by James et al.identified the ratio of hernia size to fascial defect (neck) as a potential aid in surgical decision-making, finding that a hernia-to-neck ratio > 2.5 predicted the need for emergent repair. Patients presenting to the ED with acute abdominal wall hernia symptoms who do not have an indication for urgent surgery are at high risk of being lost to follow-up. A prior multicenter study of patients with an ED visit for hernia-related symptoms showed that over 50% did not follow up in the outpatient clinic, with 20% returning to the ED with additional hernia-related complaints. Considering socioeconomic factors and health care disparities to determine the need for operative intervention at the index admission will address low clinic follow-up rates and prevent future ED resource utilization. When immediate repair is not required, an effort should be made to ensure follow-up and initiate planning for definitive repair before the patient is discharged from the ED or the inpatient setting. The ability to follow-up in the outpatient clinic and access to elective, outpatient surgery should also be considered.
Nonurgent repair or repair after patient optimization prior to surgery can be pursued for symptomatic hernias without high-risk features. These patients can likely be safely discharged from the ED with elective outpatient follow-up. If modifiable patient risk factors are identified at the time of hernia diagnosis (such as smoking, need for weight loss, or control of diabetes), these should be addressed before surgery. If the hernia is deemed complex, its eventual repair should be scheduled when patient optimization has been achieved and performed by a surgeon experienced in complex abdominal wall reconstruction techniques. Prediction of the need for component separation can be a subjective determination or made in various ways using data from cross-sectional imaging comparing aspects of the hernia to the remaining abdominal wall. Watchful waiting and outpatient follow-up may be considered for asymptomatic ventral, inguinal, and umbilical hernias found incidentally on imaging. While these have a reasonably high rate of requiring an eventual repair, it is likely safe to monitor these hernias after the patient has received counseling on monitoring the hernia for symptoms in the future.

### Elective recurrent inguinal hernia repair: value of an abdominal wall surgery unit [^114UYVZM]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most frequent procedures performed by a general surgeon. Despite being a common intervention, recurrence rates up to 15% have been reported. The risk of hernia relapse in recurrent inguinal hernias is greater than the risk of relapse after repair of the primary hernia. For this reason, it has been suggested that operations in these patients be performed by experienced surgeons. However, surgical specialization in abdominal wall surgery continues to be an area poorly studied in the literature, even more so in the case of recurrent inguinal hernia. Although clinical guidelines recommend treating these patients in specialized centers, little is known about the impact of specialization on short- and long-term postoperative outcomes in this difficult setting.

The objective of our study is to determine the impact of the surgeon's specialization and experience in abdominal wall surgery on the postoperative complications (within 90 days postoperatively), hernia recurrence and chronic postoperative inguinal pain of elective recurrent inguinal hernia repair.

### Diagnosis and treatment of chronic abdominal pain 5 years after roux-en-Y gastric bypass [^117XbURW]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Knowledge of optimal diagnostic workup, etiology, and response to treatment of chronic abdominal pain after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is limited.

Objective

To define the etiology of chronic abdominal pain presenting at the 5-year follow-up after RYGB and to evaluate response to treatment.

Setting

Oslo University Hospital (tertiary referral center for obesity surgery).

Methods

Of 234 patients operated during a randomly selected 12-month period, 165 (71%) returned for 5-year follow-up, and 160 responded to study questionnaires. Of these, 54 (34%) reported chronic abdominal pain and were invited to participate in a structured diagnostic and treatment algorithm. These patients were contacted for the evaluation of their response to treatment.

Results

Fifty-one of 54 patients (94%) reporting chronic abdominal pain at the 5-year follow-up were included in the study. Of the 45 patients with onset of symptoms post-RYGB, 28 (62%) underwent one or more radiologic evaluations, 10 (22%) underwent endoscopy, and 13 (29%) underwent laparoscopy. Diagnosis and treatment were established for 34 patients (76%), whereas 11 (24%) had abdominal pain of unknown cause. The most common etiology was internal herniation (n = 6), dumping (n = 6), food intolerance (n = 6), gallstones (n = 5), and irritable bowel syndrome (n = 4). After a median follow-up of 13.0 months (standard deviation, 11.5), 37 (82%) patients reported remission or improvement of symptoms, 6 had unchanged symptoms, and 2 patients were lost to follow-up.

Conclusions

The etiology of long-term chronic abdominal pain post-RYGB is diverse. A multidisciplinary team can help most patients with dedicated follow-up, but a subset of patients has symptoms of unknown etiology.

Treatment

Statements

Recommendations

The recommendations are strongest for informing patients about the possible occurrence of seromas and the expectation that the majority will resolve spontaneously [62, 63, 66, 83]. Given the clinically important consequences of mesh infection as a possible complication of repeated seroma aspiration, this recommendation also may be considered stronger (level B), although it is based on only level 4 evidence [62, 74].

The importance of applying a pressure dressing was supported by one study with methodologic limitations [82] and may be contradicted by the findings regarding binder placement, a circumferential pressure dressing.

Postoperative bulging

Search terms: "laparoscopic hernia repair" AND "LVHR" AND "incisional hernia" AND "ventral hernia" AND "postoperative bulging abdominal wall" AND "abdominal wall bulging" AND "abdominal wall hernia and bulging" AND "complication bulging" AND "incisional hernia and bulging" AND "bulging after hernia repair" AND "long term results"

A systemic search of the available literature was performed in August 2011 based on Medline, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and relevant journals and reference lists using the aforementioned search terms. Of the 54 articles found, only four dealt with "bulging" after laparoscopic hernia repair.

Key questions
Is it a real problem?
Is it avoidable?

Statements

Recommendations

Introduction

Besides pain, patients sometimes report postoperative abdominal bulging, which can be cosmetically dissatisfying. The anatomic basis for this problem lies in the fact that neither the hernia orifice nor the rectus diastasis (if present) was closed during laparoscopic hernia repair. These issues, relevant mainly with large hernias, should be discussed with the patient preoperatively [2].

### International guidelines for groin hernia management [^11326pDd]. Hernia (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for inguinal hernia, more specifically with respect to technical considerations for surgery, mesh repair, HSG 2018 guidelines recommend to consider using lightweight meshes when considering postoperative pain after inguinal hernia repair, recognizing that these are probably only short-term benefits.

### Spontaneous lesser omental herniation resolved by laparoscopic surgery: case report and systematic literature review [^115aD7E9]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Mild abdominal pain and vomiting could hide an internal abdominal hernia. Past abdominal trauma or surgery are risk factors for lesser omental hernias. A CT scan should be the first-line imaging of choice for persistent acute abdominal pain without alternative diagnosis when the patient is stable. Laparoscopic surgery offers a safe and reliable approach to confirm the diagnosis and reduce lesser omental hernias.

### Management of chronic pain after hernia repair [^113d6Rfb]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Preoperative and early postoperative pain

A patient's preoperative level of pain affects the risk of developing chronic pain following surgery. A large questionnaire study found that preoperative pain increased the risk of postoperative pain by a factor 1.5. However, preoperative pain is not a contraindication for surgery, but patients should be informed of the increased risk. Not only does the preoperative pain influence the risk of postoperative pain, but also there are strong indications that early high-intensity pain after surgery is a risk factor for developing chronic pain. Therefore, a standardized and effective postoperative analgesic regime could be recommended following inguinal hernia repair.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society [IEHS])-part 2 [^115dx8t3]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Bedi et al. [207] in a review of 34 original studies commented that sutures for mesh fixation might cause ischemic injuries to anterior abdominal wall musculature or neurovascular bundle, resulting in pain. Nerve entrapment due to a tack is another possible explanation for postoperative pain (Level 5).

Association of chronic pain

In a level 2b study, McKinlay et al. [208] analyzed the incidence of chronic pain after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair of primary and recurrent incisional hernias and reported chronic postoperative pain during more than 6 months. Their report of 101 primary cases showed two cases (2.8%) of recurrent pain verses 69 cases of no chronic pain.

The mesh material also may play an important role in the causation of pain. In a level 1b study, Bansal et al. [106, 165] investigated the association of acute and chronic pain with the type of mesh and did not find any difference in pain scores between heavyweight PP mesh and lightweight barrier coated meshes.

The efficacy of mesh repair is based on the formation of a strong mesh aponeurotic scar tissue complex (MAST complex). But inflammation beyond the optimum range may entrap neural structures, leading to chronic pain. Currently, large numbers of lightweight composite meshes are available that are claimed to produce optimum fibrotic reaction and to decrease the incidence of chronic pain. However, not many available studies have compared the composite meshes with the PP meshes.

Chelala et al. [102] and Franklin et al. [45] reported chronic pain incidences of 2.5 and 3.1%, respectively, after defect closure. This may indicate that closure of the defect with subsequent traction may even contribute to chronic postoperative pain.

No study was found depicting the association of chronic pain with acute pain, preoperative pain, or site and size of the defect.

### Chronic abdominal pain secondary to mesh erosion into cecum following incisional hernia repair: a case report and literature review [^1144imQN]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Incisional hernias following abdominal operations are a common complication. Mesh is frequently employed to repair these hernias. Given the popularity of minimally invasive surgery utilizing polypropylene mesh for incisional hernia repair, related complications such postoperative hematoma and seroma, foreign body reaction, organ injury, infection, mesh rejection, and fistula are being noted. Mesh migration is an infrequent occurrence, and is rarely reported in the literature. Those that are usually involve the urinary bladder. In particular, review of literature shows no reports of cases of mesh migration into the cecum several years after an open type incisional hernia repair. We present a case of delayed transmural mesh migration from the abdominal wall into the cecum presenting as chronic abdominal pain.

### Reoperation for recurrence after groin hernia repair in adolescents: a nationwide register-based cohort study [^112z3WKX]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Nonmesh repair may be sufficient for primary groin hernia repair in adolescents which could have clinical implications as the evidence on mesh‐related complications is conflicting. For young patients, postoperative chronic pain may be the most worrisome complication after hernia surgery — a concern also raised by surgeons in relation to mesh‐based repairs. For patients experiencing postoperative chronic pain, management can be difficult, escalating from an initial wait‐and‐see strategy to systemic painkillers, injections, and ultimately surgical treatment. The cause of postoperative chronic pain is probably multifactorial, and the pathogenesis may vary between individuals, but the implantation of synthetic meshes in human tissue is a concern. Data have indicated that open mesh repair for inguinal hernia may cause postoperative chronic pain in young patients, and the recently updated international guideline on groin hernia management suggests that simple annulorrhaphy could be sufficient in young men with small indirect inguinal hernia. Still, evidence on chronic pain after inguinal hernia repair in the general adult population has not found a difference between mesh and nonmesh repair. In theory, implanting a foreign material may be troublesome in growing tissue. The long‐term tension on the mesh and surrounding tissue occurring as the groin and pelvis grow during adolescence, and as the mesh shrinks with time, may contribute to chronic pain. Additionally, although no impact on fertility has been shown in adults, concerns remain regarding potential effects in young male patients after mesh implantation, which, to our knowledge, has not been studied in adolescents. To improve our understanding of potential long‐term harms after groin hernia repair in adolescents, future studies focusing on patient‐reported outcomes, including postoperative chronic pain, in young patients are encouraged.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic (TAPP) and endoscopic (TEP) treatment of inguinal hernia [International Endohernia Society (IEHS)] [^112FcxEt]. Surgical Endoscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Body weight, hernia defect size, hernia defect location, and mesh size are not related to acute and chronic pain. In the current literature on endoscopic groin hernia repair, insufficient or no data are available about the relationship between pain and the management of strangulated and incarcerated hernias, port defects, scrotal hernias, and cord lipomas. Although several publications have reported on pain and nerve management in open groin hernia surgery [48–53], no data are available on nerve manipulation and pain in endoscopic hernia repair.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for inguinal hernia, more specifically with respect to management of postoperative pain, HSG 2018 guidelines recommend to suspect vascular or nerve injury in case of immediate severe/excruciating postoperative pain. Consider performing early re-operation on the same day to either exclude or manage these complications.

### Classifying post-herniorrhaphy pain syndromes following elective inguinal hernia repair [^115BUMqD]. World Journal of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic post-herniorrhaphy pain is diverse in origin. The aim of our study was to classify post-herniorrhaphy pain syndromes following elective inguinal hernia repair.

Patients and Methods

All patients with an elective inguinal hernia repair performed between January 2000 and August 2005 received a questionnaire evaluating chronic inguinal pain (visual analog scale, VAS 0–10). Patients with moderate to severe pain complaints (VAS score ≥ 3) were invited for an interview and an outpatient department physical examination.

Results

A total of 2,164 cases underwent an elective hernia repair and received the questionnaire; 1,766 individuals responded (response rate: 81.6%). Moderate to severe pain was present in 211 patients (11.9%). Follow-up was performed in 148 patients. Three separate groups of diagnoses were identified. Group I: neuropathic pain (n = 72) indicating inguinal nerve damage; group II: non-neuropathic pain (n = 40) due to an array of diagnoses including periostitis (n = 18) and recurrent hernia (n = 13); and group III: a tender spermatic cord and/or a tight feeling in the lower abdomen (n = 43).

Conclusions

Chronic pain following elective hernia repair is common and diverse in etiology but may allow for a classification contributing to the development of tailored treatment regimens.

### Persistent postsurgical pain: risk factors and prevention [^116yfBfy]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Acute postoperative pain is followed by persistent pain in 10–50% of individuals after common operations, such as groin hernia repair, breast and thoracic surgery, leg amputation, and coronary artery bypass surgery. Since chronic pain can be severe in about 2–10% of these patients, persistent postsurgical pain represents a major, largely unrecognised clinical problem. Iatrogenic neuropathic pain is probably the most important cause of long-term postsurgical pain. Consequently, surgical techniques that avoid nerve damage should be applied whenever possible. Also, the effect of aggressive, early therapy for postoperative pain should be investigated, since the intensity of acute postoperative pain correlates with the risk of developing a persistent pain state. Finally, the role of genetic factors should be studied, since only a proportion of patients with intraoperative nerve damage develop chronic pain. Based on information about the molecular mechanisms that affect changes to the peripheral and central nervous system in neuropathic pain, several opportunities exist for multimodal pharmacological intervention. Here, we outline strategies for identification of patients at risk and for prevention and possible treatment of this important entity of chronic pain.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for inguinal hernia, more specifically with respect to management of postoperative pain, HSG 2023 guidelines recommend to consider using a tailored approach to chronic postoperative inguinal pain surgery (neurectomy, open mesh removal, or combination) depending on the original repair method, the experience of the surgeon, distribution and symptoms of pain, physical findings, and potential radiographic images.

### Internal hernia complications of gastric bypass surgery in the acute setting: spectrum of imaging findings [^1144P7PG]. Emergency Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Bariatric surgery is increasingly becoming an option for the treatment of morbid obesity. Patients who have undergone gastric bypass surgery have varied post-surgical complications which present acutely in the emergency medical setting, particularly internal hernias. It may be difficult to identify an internal hernia in the absence of intestinal obstruction. This article will review the various types of imaging presentations to highlight the complexity of making a radiographic diagnosis. Recognition of internal hernia as the cause of intermittent or acute abdominal pain symptoms in these patients in the emergency setting can prompt immediate surgical intervention, thus avoiding life-threatening outcomes.

### The analgesic efficacy of transversus abdominis plane block vs. wound infiltration after inguinal and infra-umbilical hernia repairs: a systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis [^112CAC7v]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute postoperative pain after inguinal and infra-umbilical hernia repair can be moderate to severe, and up to 20% of patients may develop chronic postoperative pain after hernia surgery. Local anaesthetic techniques are valuable options for decreasing acute postoperative pain and reducing the risk of developing persistent postsurgi-cal pain. Two of these techniques are transversus abdo-minis plane (TAP) block and local anaesthetic infiltration of the surgical wound. Of note, the TAP block consists of injecting local anaesthetic into the plane between the internal oblique and the transversus abdominis muscles to anaesthetise the sensory nerves supplying the anterior abdominal wall.

Several meta-analyses have summarised evidence that both local anaesthetic wound infiltrationand TAP blockprovide better pain relief after inguinal or infra-umbilical hernia repair than placebo. However, it remains uncertain whether one technique is superior to the other. We therefore, undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis to determine whether TAP block provides better analgesia than wound infiltration after inguinal or infra-umbilical hernia repair.

### Systematic review of management of chronic pain after surgery [^112iqKBf]. The British Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pain present for at least 3 months after a surgical procedure is described as chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) 1. CPSP affects between 10 and 50 per cent of patients after common operations such as mastectomy, cardiac surgery, hysterectomy, hernia repair, joint replacement, back surgery and also more minor procedures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. In a European survey 9 of surgical patients, the prevalence of moderate to severe CPSP at 12 months after operation was 11·8 per cent. Chronic pain is associated with poor general health, disability, depression 9, 10, 11, 12 and social withdrawal, and increases the risk of further co‐morbidities 13. CPSP has been defined previously as pain that develops after surgery 5, and a proposed update to the definition includes the possibility that CPSP is pain that increases in intensity after surgery 14. This update allows for the possibility that pain among patients who undergo surgery to relieve pain is also, appropriately, included in the definition.

Risk factors for CPSP may be genetic, psychosocial, or related to preoperative or acute postoperative pain severity 2, 15. However, certain surgical procedure‐related factors are key for the development of chronic pain 16. Surgical procedures lasting longer than 3 h may increase the risk of postoperative pain 5. A major surgical factor in the development of chronic pain is nerve injury, and patients undergoing thoracic, breast and hernia surgery are at particular risk of neuropathic pain 8. Inflammation resulting from intraoperative tissue injury can contribute to central sensitization and further pain 2. Inadequate preventive analgesia may also contribute 17.

Knowledge of determinants and predictors of CPSP can guide the development of interventions and help target care. Possible forms of management for CPSP may focus on the underlying condition that needed surgery, on the aetiology of the pain, or be multifactorial in recognition of the diverse causes of postoperative pain. Although some forms of management may have limited applicability outside of the specific condition for which they were intended, others may be transferrable, regardless of the surgical procedure.

### Imaging the postoperative patient: long-term complications of gastrointestinal surgery [^114cFDe7]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Adhesions

Adhesive bands are funiculate structures that form between the peritoneum of tissues and organs, often as a result of injury during surgery. They are composed of fibrous tissue and abundant fat.

Adhesions are the most common cause of bowel obstruction after surgery, and they constitute the leading cause of long-term reoperation following abdominal and pelvic surgery.

Bowel loops that pass through the orifice between the adhesive band and the peritoneum form a type of internal hernia that can evolve to closed-loop obstruction. CT findings in this situation are similar to those in other internal hernias (cf. "Internal hernias"). Overt obstructive small-bowel disease related to adhesions can be further subdivided into simple obstruction and closed-loop or strangulated obstruction.

Nevertheless, a non-obstructive subtype can also be found. These patients may have intermittent or low-grade small-bowel obstruction, for which CT has poor sensitivity. CT enteroclysis or dynamic MRI may be important options for better demonstrating the transition point.

The diagnosis of small-bowel obstruction due to adhesions is presumed when all other causes of obstruction have been ruled out on CT. The main CT findings that suggest adhesions as the culprit of the obstruction include a narrow zone of transition without an identifiable lesion (such as a mass, wall thickening or adenopathy), acute angulation of the small-bowel loops, traction deformities, stretching of the bowel loops, small-bowel loops closely applied to the anterior abdominal wall and the "fat-bridging sign" which represents the adhesive band itself as a cord-like structure containing mesenteric fat that bridges two peritoneal surfaces (Figs. 10, 11, and 12).

Fig. 10
Small-bowel dilation due to an adhesion in a patient with abdominal pain. There is an abrupt narrowing and acute angulation of the loop, with no identifiable underlying lesion (arrow). There is also ascites (star) and mesentery densification due to edema (arrowheads), findings suggestive of strangulated obstruction

### ACR appropriateness criteria® hernia [^116mgPb9]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abdominopelvic hernias are common clinical entities composed of a wide variety of congenital, traumatic, and iatrogenic etiologies. Any weakness in the body wall may result in hernia of cavity contents with concomitant risks of morbidity and mortality. Presentations may be specific, palpable body wall mass/bulge, or vague, nonspecific pain through bowel obstruction. This document focuses on initial imaging of the adult population with signs of symptoms prompting suspicion of abdominopelvic hernia. Imaging of the abdomen and pelvis to evaluate defects is essential for prompt diagnosis and treatment. Often CT and ultrasound are the first-line modalities to quickly evaluate the abdomen and pelvis, providing for accurate diagnoses and management of patients. MRI protocols may be useful as first-line imaging studies, especially in patients with orthopedic instrumentation. Although often performed, abdominal radiographs and fluorographic procedures may provide indirect evidence of hernias but are usually not indicated for initial diagnosis of hernia. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Trocar site hernia after laparoscopy: early recognition prevents catastrophic sequelae [^11295wgQ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Trocar site hernia is a rare but potentially serious complication of laparoscopic surgery that may lead to bowel incarceration and strangulation. Prompt diagnosis by emergency physicians facilitates timely intervention that prevents bowel necrosis. We report a case of trocar site hernia presenting to the emergency department (ED) with abdominal pain that was correctly diagnosed and promptly managed.

Case Report

A 25-year-old woman, gravida 2, abortion 2, underwent outpatient surgery and laparoscopic removal of a ruptured right-sided tubal pregnancy without any intraoperative difficulties. However, 48 h later, she presented to the ED complaining of acute abdominal pain and nausea. Computed tomography revealed a loop of small bowel herniating through a 12-mm right lower quadrant trocar site defect in the fascia. She was taken back to the operating room, where the computed tomography findings were confirmed and the entrapped bowel was successfully reduced and the fascial defect repaired. The patient was discharged home feeling much improved. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Trocar site hernia is a rare but potentially dangerous complication that can present with acute symptoms or be asymptomatic if late in onset. Intestinal necrosis begins as soon as 6 h after constriction of blood flow to entrapped bowel, so timely intervention is critically important. Therefore, trocar site hernias should be considered in patients presenting with abdominal complaints after laparoscopic surgery and included in the differential diagnosis of bowel obstruction.

### Chronic pain after femoral hernia repair: a cross-sectional study [^116pc8oj]. Annals of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To explore the prevalence of and to identify possible risk factors for chronic pain after surgery for femoral hernia.

Background

Chronic pain has become a very important outcome in quality assessment of inguinal hernia surgery. There are no studies on the risk for chronic pain after femoral hernia surgery.

Methods

The Inguinal Pain Questionnaire was sent to 1967 patients who had had a repair for primary unilateral femoral hernia between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 2006. A follow-up period of at least 18 months was chosen. Answers from 1461 patients were matched with data recorded in the Swedish Hernia Register and analyzed.

Results

Some degree of pain during the previous week was reported by 24.2% (354) of patients. Pain interfered with daily activities in 5.5% (81) of patients. Emergency surgery (OR = 0.54; 95% CI = 0.40–0.74) and longer time since surgery (OR = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.89–0.98 for each year added) were associated with lower risk for chronic postoperative pain, whereas a high level of preoperative pain was associated with a higher risk for chronic pain (OR = 1.17; 95% CI = 1.10–1.25). Surgical technique was not found to influence the risk for chronic pain in multivariate logistic regression analysis.

Conclusions

Chronic postoperative pain is as important a complication after femoral hernia surgery as it is after inguinal hernia surgery. In contrast to inguinal hernia surgery, no risk factor related to surgical technique was found. Further investigations into the role of preoperative pain are necessary.

### Poorly controlled postoperative pain: prevalence, consequences, and prevention [^115acCVi]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic postoperative pain

Poorly managed acute pain experienced after surgery may also result in the development of chronic pain. Based on reviews of the literature, persistent pain appears to affect between 10% and 60% of patients after common operations.–Fluctuations in reported incidence of chronic postsurgical pain are likely associated in part with the lack of a standardized definition of this complication, although it is frequently defined as enduring pain that has no other evident causes and lasts at least 2 months after surgery, ie, past the expected healing period.

As with early pain, the prevalence of chronic postsurgical pain varies by type of surgery and generally decreases with time. In a 2-year, Spanish prospective cohort study of 2,929 patients who required hernia repair, thoracotomy, or hysterectomy, the incidence of chronic pain ranged from 37.6% (thoracotomy) to 11.8% (vaginal hysterectomy) at 4 months postsurgery (Figure 2). In a French prospective cohort study of 2,397 patients who underwent cholecystectomy, inguinal herniorrhaphy, saphenectomy, sternotomy, thoracotomy, knee arthroscopy, breast cancer surgery, or elective cesarean section, the highest mean pain scores were observed after knee arthroscopy and thoracotomy, and the lowest after herniorrhaphy and cesarean section. The proportions of patients who reported persistent pain were 34.8% and 29.5% at 3 and 6 months after surgery, respectively.

Over the last two decades, understanding of the mechanisms involved in the development of chronic pain has improved, with a combination of factors emerging as contributors, most notably inflammatory processes, tissue and nerve damage, and central sensitization.–The development of chronic pain after surgical intervention has been shown to involve preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors. Numerous studies of patients undergoing a broad variety of surgery types have demonstrated that the presence and intensity of acute postoperative pain are significant predictive risk factors for the development of chronic pain (Table 1). A few studies have not found acute postoperative pain to be a significant predictor of chronic pain, but these conflicting findings may be linked to the studies' relatively small patient populations. Other potential determinants of persistent pain after surgery include younger age, female sex, obesity, smoking, genetic predisposition, preexisting pain, psychological factors (eg, preoperative anxiety and depression), and duration of surgery.

### Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair: early follow-up of a randomized controlled study of primary fascial closure before mesh placement [^117TX5H1]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Suturing of the hernia aperture in laparoscopic ventral hernia repair has increased during the past decade. The primary aim of this is to restore the anatomy of the abdominal wall. Closure of the aperture, however, may cause additional tension in the abdominal wall which could increase postoperative pain. The aim of this study was to investigate whether suturing of the hernia aperture affects postoperative pain and hernia-site complications, including seroma, infection, pseudohernia, and mesh migration, 3 months after repair.

Methods

Some 192 patients with a midline hernia between 2 and 8 cm in transverse diameter were included in a randomized controlled double-blinded multicentre study. Patients were randomized to mesh repair with (intervention) or without (control) suturing of the hernia aperture before mesh placement. Patients completed the Ventral Hernia Pain Questionnaire before and 3 months after surgery. Abdominal wall pain and hernia-site complications were assessed 3 months after surgery.

Results

Ninety-seven patients were randomized to the intervention group and 95 to the control group. Among all patients, median age and BMI was 56 years and 31 kg/m² respectively. Overall pain experienced decreased by 3 months after operation (P < 0.001). There was no difference between groups regarding hernia-site complications or pain experienced during the past week (13 versus 23 patients; P = 0.111). Seroma and pseudohernia occurred in 13 and 11 patients in the intervention and control groups respectively (P = 0.975 and P = 0.977).

Conclusion

Restoration of the abdominal wall anatomy by suturing the hernia aperture before mesh placement does not increase the risk of hernia-site complication or pain 3 months after surgery. This implies that fascial suturing of the aperture can be justified if there are potential long-term benefits such as lower recurrence and/or complication rates. Registration number: ISRCTN51495042.

### TAP block prior to open ventral hernia repair improves surgical outcome [^115BhMU5]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ventral hernias commonly affect patients after major abdominal surgery. Its estimated incidence is approximately 20%, increasing to 40% in high-risk populations. Perioperative pain control is one of the goals of postoperative management. Patients frequently suffer from acute and chronic pain, and this significantly affects their postoperative quality of life. Opioid analgesics were used widely until the mounting opioid crisis required physicians to provide alternative analgesia techniques. Moreover, these techniques can be considered not only alternatives but also instruments to reduce the overall opioid dosage prescribed during hospitalization and after discharge.

Today, pain control research and methodologies have been enriched not only by different medications but also by different analgesic techniques. Given the heterogeneity of the techniques proposed, their absolute superiority or a precise indication for one of these techniques has not been proven for a specific surgical technique adopted to perform abdominal wall hernia repair.

To reduce postoperative pain, the effects of the transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block have been investigated. Although recent publications have mainly focused on its use in inguinal hernia repair, evidence in the literature regarding the effectiveness of the TAP block in open ventral hernia repair (OVHR) remains inadequate. This study aims to investigate and compare the outcomes of different postoperative analgesia techniques to determine one technique's superiority in different scenarios.

### Is chronic post-herniorrhaphy pain always chronic? A literature review [^115ZmVtX]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

All studies reviewed found a gradual decrease in pain with time. Even if t₁/₂ is a very simplified way of describing the course of CPSP, it may help to understand the slow but gradual healing process.

None of the studies included in the present review had a follow-up time exceeding 10 years. It cannot, therefore, be excluded that the gradual decrease seen during the first 10 years ceases later on. Since it is only in the last 10 years that the problem of CPSP has gained focus, it is difficult to identify patient cohorts dating further back in time. Nevertheless, there are no obvious reasons to believe that the natural course of CPSP has changed over history.

The natural course of persisting pain should be considered before advocating aggressive measures to deal with it, such as a reoperation. It cannot be ruled out that the favorable long-term outcome after reoperation is, at least partly, regression to the mean phenomenon. Even without re-intervention, time itself would have led to improvement.

An exponential model is only fully adequate if reduction in pain is constant over time. Needless to say, there are several factors that do not fit into such a model. The course of post-herniorrhaphy pain is probably dependent on a number of factors that vary with time, including nerve entrapment, inflammatory reaction, nerve regeneration, psychological assimilation, and decreasing demands on physical performance with age. The pathogenesis of CPSP varies and depends on the intervention. Nerve lesions play a major role in the development of persistent pain following hernia repair. The ilioinguinal, iliohypgastric, and genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve are the nerves most at risk for being damaged. Preoperative pain, inflammatory reaction, and genetic susceptibility, may also contribute. Neuropathic pain seems to be more persistent, whereas nociceptive pain and pain caused by mechanical compression or tension may gradually decrease with time as a result of tissue rearrangement. Psychological adaptation and coping may also influence the long-term course. Whatever, it must be a solace for these patients to know that the pain is likely to gradually decrease with time.

### Chronic pain after open inguinal hernia repair: expertise-based randomized clinical trial of heavyweight or lightweight mesh [^114vWj3b]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inguinal hernia is the most common type of hernia in men, with a lifetime risk of 27 per cent. Therefore, with estimated 20 million inguinal repairs performed each year, each improvement in surgical technique translates into substantial public health benefits.

Mesh repairs have become standard practice for inguinal hernias, as recurrence rates are lower than those associated with classical tissue repair. Because recurrence rates are now low, the focus of technical improvements has shifted to outcomes such as chronic postoperative pain, which affects up to 30 per cent of all patients after inguinal hernia repair. Chronic postoperative pain is classified by the ICD-11 as pain lasting more than 3 months after surgery. This pain is often neuropathic in character, believed to be caused by tissue and nerve trauma induced by surgical dissection, as well as inflammation and a foreign body reaction owing to the suture material and mesh.

Some studies, have reported that the use of lightweight mesh is associated with decreased postoperative chronic pain compared with heavyweight mesh at 6 months after inguinal hernia repair. However, results are conflicting, as other studies, evaluating pain 3–5 years after surgery did not show such differences. Unfortunately, there are very limited long-term data addressing this topic from RCTs.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term impact of heavyweight or lightweight mesh on chronic pain, discomfort, and recurrence rates a decade after open anterior inguinal hernia repair. It was hypothesized that the lightweight mesh group would have less pain and discomfort than the heavyweight mesh group, whereas recurrence rates would be similar in the two groups.

The 1-year mean (SD) follow-up time was 1.81 (0.04) years in both arms. The majority of the participants reported less groin symptoms than before the operation (92 of 97 [94.8%] and 93 of 98 [94.9%] in the control and intervention arms, respectively). Overall, the mean (SD) IPQ at 1 year was 1.53 (1.1) and 1.56 (0.94) in the control and intervention arms, respectively (absolute difference = −0.03; (95% CI, −3.2 to 2.5; p = 0.81). The mean (SD) IPQ difference (Δ IPQ) between baseline and 1 year postoperatively was 1.96 (1.5) and 1.85 (1.2) in the control and intervention arms, respectively (absolute difference = 0.11; 95% CI, −2.7 to 5.0; p = 0.56); however, 1 participant still reported severe pain (IPQ score = 7) at 1-year follow-up. Participants with severe pain were reviewed a second time to differentiate more thoroughly between pain due to hernia and other possible causes of chronic groin pain. This was done by A.M. P.N. and J.L. It was concluded that most complaints presenting as groin pain were most likely musculoskeletal in origin.

### Management of chronic pain after hernia repair [^114hEa9W]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Postoperative chronic pain is a special entity within the domain of chronic pain. Chronic postoperative pain occurs following numerous kinds of surgery, from amputations to thoracotomies to inguinal hernia surgery. The chronic pain after inguinal hernia repair has been extensively studied; however, the management is still difficult. Around the globe, millions of groin hernia repairs are conducted annuallyand 8%–16% of these patients experience chronic pain to a degree that impairs their daily lives 6 months postoperatively. A few percent of these patients experience disabling pain, and due to the large number of groin hernia repairs, the number of patients with disabling pain and discomfort is an important clinical problem. Depending on the degree of pain and the impact on daily activities, an evidence-based treatment option should be offered. A problem with some of the current evidence, based on research in chronic pain after groin hernia repair, is the use of different assessment methods and different lengths of follow-up. Surgeons, scientists, and pain specialists use different assessment methods, ie, researchers use different questionnaires in order to assess chronic pain in research projects, and this limits comparability.

The aim of this review is to provide an overview of treatment strategies for patients with chronic pain following inguinal hernia repair based on best practice guidelines and clinical routines.

### European hernia society guidelines on management of rectus diastasis [^112NaKxs]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

KQ8 What is the optimal treatment of rectus diastasis with concomitant umbilical or epigastric hernias?

Statement: Mesh-based repair is recommended according to the European Hernia Society and Americas Hernia Society Guidelines for Treatment of Umbilical and Epigastric Hernias. Plication of the anterior rectus sheath may be sufficient to repair the smallest (less than 1 cm) umbilical or epigastric hernias. Other approaches have been reported. The endoscopic subcutaneous dissection followed by linea alba plication with an onlay mesh was the most reported technique.

Recommendation: A mesh-based repair of RD with concomitant midline hernias is suggested. Plication of the linea alba may be sufficient to repair a diastasis associated with small (less than 1 cm) umbilical/epigastric hernias.

Quality of evidence: Low

Strength of recommendation: Weak

KQ9 Is there a role for specific postoperative management of RD repair?

Statement: Abdominal binders appear to aid mobilization, and reduce postoperative pain and psychological stress. They have no effect on seroma formation or pulmonary function. No specific postoperative rehabilitation programme is used worldwide.

Recommendation: As a clinical expertise guidance, the use of an abdominal binder in the postoperative period can be suggested. The noted advantages of reduced pain, enhanced mobilization, and their perceived psychological support after surgery, make their contribution modest but of value. No specific postoperative rehabilitation programme can be recommended.

Quality of evidence: Very low

Strength of recommendation: Weak

### Management of chronic pain after hernia repair [^113gfRpf]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic pain following inguinal hernia repair is a common problem and feared complication. Up to 16% of people experience chronic pain following the repair of a groin hernia. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of treatment strategies for patients with chronic pain following inguinal hernia repair based on best practice guidelines and current clinical routines. The optimal management of chronic pain following inguinal hernia surgery should begin with a thorough clinical examination to rule out other causes of chronic pain and to rule out a recurrence. A scaled approach to treatment is recommended. Initially, watchful waiting can be tried if it can be tolerated by the patient and then systemic painkillers, escalating to blocks, and surgery as the final option. Surgery should include mesh removal and triple neurectomy following anterior approaches or mesh and tack removal following a posterior approach. The diagnosis and treatment strategies should be performed by or discussed with experts in the field.

Groin hernia repairs and pain

For the initial repair of groin hernia, recommendations include use of a mesh. Dedicated centers have shown good results with nonmesh-based techniques, but the overall recommendation for routine care includes use of a mesh. Globally, the most used types of mesh-based repairs are the Lichtenstein open repair and one of the variations of the laparoscopic repair. The Lichtenstein repair is known to cause discomfort and disabling pain in some patients. The laparoscopic techniques seem to lower the risk of chronic pain but still cause chronic pain in some people.

Several potential causes of pain have been investigated for these repair methods. The role of the meshes has been investigated, and the weight of the mesh (g/m 2) has been hypothesized to influence the risk of pain. Heavyweight meshes have been compared with lightweight meshes but demonstrated no advantages for laparoscopic repairs. However, the lightweight meshes seem to lower the risk of chronic pain following the Lichtenstein repair technique. Besides meshes, the choice of fixation method for the mesh can influence the risk of pain. Glue has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of chronic pain in open mesh-based repairs, but the advantage of glue could not be found in a recent nationwide study of the laparoscopic repair.

When operating inguinal hernias, there is a risk of causing injuries that will cause pain. If there is injury to tissue, it can cause nociceptive pain, and damage to nerves can cause neuropathic pain. In order to prevent or minimize the risks of pain, surgeons always take care when performing repairs and handle tissue gently. Peroperatively, the role of identification and/or resection of nerves has been investigated in order to minimize the occurrence of chronic pain. The nerves can be in the way when placing the mesh, can be caught or injured during fixation, and can be injured by accident or by dissection in the operative field. It is recommended, in the recently published World Guidelines for inguinal hernia repair, to identify the nerves but not to do a planned resection; however, if the nerves are in the way when placing the mesh, a "pragmatic resection" is recommended.

### What are the influencing factors for chronic pain following TAPP inguinal hernia repair: an analysis of 20, 004 patients from the herniamed registry [^114FYjd6]. Surgical Endoscopy (2018). Low credibility.

After mesh-based inguinal hernia repair 10–12% of patients experience at least a level of moderate pain that impacts daily activities. Chronic pain is defined as any pain reported by the patient at or beyond 3 months postoperatively. More than one-quarter of these patients (2–4%) have moderate to severe pain. Risk factors for chronic postoperative inguinal pain include young age, female gender, high preoperative pain, early high postoperative pain, recurrent hernia, and open hernia repair.

In all statements in the guidelines of the international hernia societies, laparo-endoscopic techniques are associated with less chronic pain than the Lichtenstein repair. However, after laparo-endoscopic inguinal hernia repair, 2–5% of patients may still suffer from persistent pain influencing everyday activities, and about 0.4% are referred to pain clinics.

On the basis of three meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials mesh fixation in total extraperitoneal patch plasty (TEP) can only be recommended in large medial/direct (EHS MIII) hernias.

In the Guidelines of the International Endohernia Society, a recommendation is given for consideration of non-fixation of the mesh in transabdominal preperitoneal patch plasty (TAPP) inguinal hernia repair in types LI, II and MI, II (EHS classification). For TAPP repair of larger defects (LIII, MIII), the mesh should be fixed. In TAPP inguinal hernia repair, mesh fixation is still used in 66.1% of all primary unilateral cases in men.

Considering the fact that five meta-analyses compared non-penetrating vs. mechanical mesh fixation, high-quality evidence could be expected. However, the meta-analyses can only conclude that the evidence is mostly of low or moderate quality, or that more high-quality multicenter studies are needed. In view of the guidelines, fibrin glue should be considered for fixation to minimize the risk of postoperative acute and chronic pain.

In a nationwide registry-based study, no differences were found in the frequency of recurrence and chronic pain between permanent and no/non-permanent fixation of the mesh in endoscopic inguinal hernia repair.

Another registry-based study from the Danish Hernia Database also found no difference in chronic pain after mesh fixation with fibrin glue vs. tacks in TAPP inguinal hernia repair.

The following analysis of data from the Herniamed Registry now investigates the influencing factors for chronic pain in male patients after primary, unilateral inguinal hernia repair in TAPP technique.

### Chronic abdominal pain secondary to mesh erosion into cecum following incisional hernia repair: a case report and literature review [^1138dJYT]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Once there is erosion of the mesh into the bowel, the question is whether or not it should be repaired. Repair would entail laparatomy, bowel resection, mesh resection, and anastomosis. However, there is a high likelihood of hernia recurrence after mesh removal, and placement of a mesh at the time of surgery may result in a high probability of postoperative infection. One solution would be a staged operation, with mesh/bowel resection first followed by a subsequent surgery to place a new mesh. Another would be to use biologic mesh at the time of cecal resection, but biologic meshes are costly and are associated with problems such as stretching and may become infected themselves.

In conclusion, mesh migration, particularly erosion, is a rare complication of any incisional hernia repair, especially when polypropylene mesh is used for repair. There is no clear cause of this complication, but new methods of mesh fixation, as well as types of mesh, are being investigated. It should also be recognized that mesh complications, particularly erosion, tend to occur years later and should be considered in atypical patient presentations. Tissue placement between the mesh and bowel to prevent direct contact of the two may help avoid this complication.

Given the popularity of these surgical procedures, complications may be frequently encountered. Gastroenterologists should thus be aware of the potential complications and the appropriate management.

Pathogenesis

The cause of chronic pain following inguinal hernia surgery can be multifactorial and often it is not possible to point to a distinct reason for the pain in a specific patient. Pain can be caused by perioperative injury to nerves or nerves that are being stuck and damaged by sutures or perforated by fixation devices such as tacks. Nerves can also be trapped in a "meshoma", which is when the mesh has shrunk with folding and wrinkling making a ball of mesh material, the so-called meshoma. It is reasonable to imagine that some shrinking of the mesh, which is seen in most patients, can also entrap a nerve and thereby cause chronic pain. Pain can also be caused by the inflammation process around the mesh. It is sometimes not possible to diagnose the specific cause of pain in the individual patient. Furthermore, the distinction between neuropathic pain (pain caused by damage to nerves) and nociceptive pain (pain caused by the release of substances due to tissue damage or damage to organs) can be difficult. Some patients might have groin pain from other sources than their hernia repair such as hip pathology or pubalgia. Furthermore, some patients might have received a hernia repair due to these other pathologies, resulting in symptoms similar to a hernia.

When investigating the patient with chronic postoperative pain, it is important to look for a possible recurrence since the recurrence could be the reason for pain or discomfort. If a recurrence is present, it is indicated to repair the recurrence and hopefully that will relieve the complaints and discomfort of the patient. However, care should be taken when repairing recurrent hernias if there is also signs of neuropathic pain, since the patient might at the same time have damaged nerves. If there are damaged nerves, repair of the recurrence might not solve the problem for, and it is therefore recommended to also consider a neurectomy at the same time.

### Emergency laparoscopy – current best practice [^116ni8gB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Non-specific abdominal pain

Whilst most patients presenting with abdominal pain will be diagnosed within a short period of assessment, there remains a cohort in whom the clinical picture remains equivocal. In these patients, depending on the severity of their symptoms, laparoscopy plays a role. If patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are relatively less concerning, then a period of observation may allow clarification of a diagnosis or simply cessation of the pain. However in those where observation is not safe, due to the severity of the clinical findings, we advocate diagnostic laparoscopy. The reasons for this are two fold. Firstly, converted-to-open cases have a similar outcome to primary laparotomy, thus minimising potential negative effects of laparoscopy. Secondly, as discussed above, many common pathologies, which may be the underlying cause of the non-specific abdominal pain, are now best managed laparoscopically.

### Inguinal hernias: diagnosis and management [^111VmaKa]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Groin hernias are caused by a defect of the abdominal wall in the groin area and comprise inguinal and femoral hernias. Inguinal hernias are more common in men. Although groin hernias are easily diagnosed on physical examination in men, ultrasonography is often needed in women. Ultrasonography is also helpful when a recurrent hernia, surgical complication after repair, or other cause of groin pain (e.g., groin mass, hydrocele) is suspected. Magnetic resonance imaging has higher sensitivity and specificity than ultrasonography and is useful for diagnosing occult hernias if clinical suspicion is high despite negative ultrasound findings. Herniography, which involves injecting contrast media into the hernial sac, may be used in selected patients. Becoming familiar with the common types of surgical interventions can help family physicians facilitate postoperative care and assess for complications, including recurrence. Laparoscopic repair is associated with shorter recovery time, earlier resumption of activities of daily living, less pain, and lower recurrence rates than open repair. Watchful waiting is a reasonable and safe option in men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias. Watchful waiting is not recommended in patients with symptomatic hernias or in nonpregnant women.

Introduction

It is well established that surgical injury can lead to chronic pain, defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) as pain lasting for 3 months or more [89]. The components and risk factors for postoperative pain can be classified as patient factors, intraoperative factors (tissue damage, mesh type, type of anesthesia), and postoperative factors (type of analgesia. Patient factors [90, 91] contribute to postoperative pain perception but were not investigated in the studies available for review.

The studies on this topic included in the review showed substantial heterogeneity, with varying definitions of pain. The definition of chronic/prolonged pain was often vague, ranging from longer than 24 h to longer than 6 months. Furthermore, the trial designs and reporting were not uniform, further limiting the comparability of the outcomes. This also was noted in the reported metaanalyses of laparoscopic ventral hernia repair [2, 17, 92].

Specific studies examining chronic pain in patients with ventral hernia repair are infrequent. We may be able to extrapolate some findings from other studies relevant to the assessment of pain syndromes and chronic pain. In inguinal hernia repair, e.g. other preoperative chronic pain conditions not related to the groin [122–124] as well as severe early postoperative pain [124–128] after groin hernia repair are significant risk factors for chronic pain. Ventral hernia recurrence was reported as a risk factor for chronic pain in a large Veteran's Affairs Medical Centers survey [94]. A nonmidline (e.g. lumbar) location is accompanied by both more pre- and postoperative pain [97].

Attempts at prevention of chronic pain after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair have involved mainly different mesh fixation techniques. Unfortunately, the results of these studies often are contradictory [93, 96, 98, 101, 102, 118–121]. Local anesthetic infiltration is reported to be of benefit [103, 104]. However, one report on infusion of local anesthetic showed no benefit [95]. Regrettably, the treatment of chronic pain after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair is described in small case series that address local and systemic pain treatment as well as removal of fixation or mesh components or excision of neuroma [102, 120].

### Evidence-based management of postoperative pain in adults undergoing open inguinal hernia surgery [^113mniGP]. The British Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Open inguinal hernia repair is associated with moderate postoperative pain, but optimal analgesia remains controversial. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the available literature on the management of pain after open hernia surgery.

Methods

Randomized studies, in English, published between January 1966 and March 2009, assessing analgesic and anaesthetic interventions in adult open hernia surgery, and reporting pain scores, were retrieved from the Embase and MEDLINE databases. In addition to published evidence, clinical practice was taken into account to ensure that the recommendations had clinical validity.

Results

Of the 334 randomized studies identified, 79 were included. Quantitative analysis suggested that regional anaesthesia was superior to general anaesthesia for reducing postoperative pain. Spinal anaesthesia was associated with a higher incidence of urinary retention and increased time to home-readiness compared with regional anaesthesia.

Conclusion

Field block with, or without wound infiltration, either as a sole anaesthetic/analgesic technique or as an adjunct to general anaesthesia, is recommended to reduce postoperative pain. Continuous local anaesthetic infusion of a surgical wound provides a longer duration of analgesia. Conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or cyclo-oxygenase 2-selective inhibitors in combination with paracetamol, administered in time to provide sufficient analgesia in the early recovery phase, are optimal. In addition, weak opioids are recommended for moderate pain, and strong opioids for severe pain, on request.

### A 1-stage surgical treatment for postherniorrhaphy neuropathic pain… [^1165ovyo]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Background The recommended surgical treatment for chronic neuropathic pain after herniorrhaphy has been a 2-stage operation including: ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric neurectomies through an inguinal approach and genital nerve neurectomy through a flank approach. Hypothesis A 1-stage surgical procedure resecting all 3 nerves from an anterior approach avoids a second operation through the flank and successfully treats chronic neuralgia. Setting A private practice dedicated to abdominal wall hernia surgery in general community hospitals. Patients Between 1995 and 2001, 49 patients underwent triple neurectomies with proximal end implantation to treat chronic postherniorrhaphy neuralgia. PROLONGED PAIN and burning sensation in the inguinal region after inguinal hernia repair are potentially incapacitating complications that represent a substantial diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.

According to Starling et al1 and the number of calls and referrals to the Lichtenstein Hernia Institute, Los Angeles, Calif, the incidence of chronic neuralgia after herniorrhaphy is probably understated. Chronic neuralgia is easily distinguished from normal postoperative pain. The latter occurs immediately after surgery, is easily treated with analgesics, and gradually subsides as the wound heals. Chronic neuralgia, however, is an often debilitating pain that includes paresthesia, hypoesthesia, and dysesthesia. Many patients with this complication also have other problems, such as mood swings, depression, or long-term drug dependency, and often are unable to return to work. The main causes of nerve injury are inadequate dissection, failure to visualize and protect the nerves during hernia repair, and failure to recognize the aberrant location and anatomic variations of the nerves.
3.

Many patients in this group felt vindicated in their complaints when it became evident that they were not "crazy" or "malingering. " All other patients re ported a satisfactory quality of life after their operations. Even those with transient mild pain graded their pain as insignificant and clearly different from their preoperative pain. One patient, an Olympic silver medalist in track and field who could not run for a year, returned to regular workouts and competition a month after his triple neurectomy. Reported results of the 2-stage operation are comparable to those from our 1-stage procedure. 2.

### Mesh fixation to fascia during incisional hernia repair results in increased prevalence of pain at long-term follow up: a multicenter propensity score matched prospective observational study [^116UvYPs]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

With an incidence of up to 25%, incisional hernia is a frequent long-term complication of open abdominal surgery. Treatment of incisional hernia and related complications induces considerable health-care spending.

International guidelines equivocally advocate for an incisional hernia repair with a non-absorbable mesh, because recurrence is two-fold reduced compared to suture repair. Laparoscopic operation technique was shown to reduce postoperative surgical site infections (SSI), overall complications and hospital length of stay. However, recurrence rates do not differ when comparing open and laparoscopic operation technique.

Long-term patient-reported outcomes remain to be studied in detail to refine surgical techniques. With up to 50% of patients that underwent incisional hernia repair reporting pain at 6 months follow-up this remains a substantial problem. Further, the ideal mesh position (onlay vs. sublay vs. intraperitoneal) and fixation technique has broadly been discussed in the literature with regard to recurrence of incisional hernia. However, these studies often neglect patient-reported outcomes.

We hypothesized that type of mesh fixation technique using tacks, suture fixation to the fascia or the peritoneum is of major importance for the development of chronic pain and might be more important than the actual mesh position.

Therefore, we aimed to report long-term outcomes of the applied surgical techniques, mesh position and fixation technique and assess their relationship with the occurrence of long-term pain.

### Is chronic post-herniorrhaphy pain always chronic? A literature review [^111ThsZd]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Since the main indication for hernia surgery is to reduce pain, great care in decision-making should be taken in order not to cause iatrogenic pain following a procedure undertaken on vague indications. Patients who are at risk for developing CPSP (young patients, women, patients perceiving intense preoperative pain, patients with tendency to develop anxiety and depression, and patients with previous history of high sensibility to nociceptive pain) should be identified before the decision to perform surgery is taken. Even if some of the symptoms may resolve with time, great care should be taken not to cause iatrogenic pain that may persist for many years.

Introduction

Incisional hernia is the most common complication of abdominal surgery, with an incidence up to 10–15% and recurrence rates of 20–45%. These hernias are often repaired with synthetic mesh to reinforce the repair or to reduce tension on weakened or missing abdominal wall fascia. This case presents one unusual complication of using mesh migration. In this case, the source of a patient's abdominal pain was found to be the erosion of the polypropylene mesh into the cecum.

### Sports hernia: diagnosis and treatment highlighting a minimal repair surgical technique [^112sEanZ]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Groin injuries are a common occurrence in elite-level athletes. These injuries can cause significant pain and disability, leading to prolonged periods of inactivity and consternation among athletes, coaches, athletic trainers, and physicians alike. The differential diagnosis for groin pain is vast and spans multiple disciplines, including orthopaedics, general surgery, urology, gynecology, and neurology. Sports hernias are one cause of chronic groin pain in athletes and are distinct entities from classic hernias. They are often caused by a deficient posterior wall of the inguinal canal, but may also involve concurrent injuries, such as conjoint and adductor tendinopathies and nerve entrapment. Understanding the complex lower abdominal, pelvic, and hip anatomy and pathophysiology of sports hernias is crucial to making an accurate diagnosis and providing appropriate treatment options. Newer, less invasive surgical repair techniques show promising early results in improving pain and decreasing recovery time.

Regarding surgical interventions for inguinal hernia, more specifically with respect to technical considerations for surgery, mesh repair, HSG 2023 guidelines recommend to use a heavyweight mesh for laparoendoscopic repair, especially in a large and direct hernia, to reduce the risk of recurrence. Do not use lightweight mesh, as it does not reduce the risk of postoperative pain but increases the risk of recurrence.

### Updated guideline for closure of abdominal wall incisions from the European and American hernia societies [^115Rm8Kr]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Incisional hernias are frequent complications of abdominal wall incisions. A meta-analysisincluding over 14 000 patients reported a weighted incidence of 12.8 per cent 2 years after a midline incision, and that one-third of patients with an incisional hernia undergo surgical repair. Recurrence rates after repair of incisional hernia range between 23 and 50 per cent, with increasing rates of complications and re-recurrence after each subsequent failed repair. A reduction in incidence of incisional hernia by 5 per cent was calculated to result in a cost saving of €4 million per year in France. Prevention of incisional hernia is therefore important.

Patient factors contribute to the risk of developing an incisional hernia, including obesity, age, smoking, aneurysmal disease, and wound infections. Location of the incision, suture material used, and closure technique are also well known risk factors. In 2015, the European Hernia Society (EHS)published guidelines on closure of abdominal wall incisions. Since then, several knowledge gaps, as identified by the guidelines committee, have been addressed in systematic reviews and meta-analyses. This warranted an update of the EHS guidelines, which was performed in collaboration with the American Hernia Society (AHS).

The objective of this paper was to provide an up-to-date guideline on abdominal wall incisions in adults with the aim of reducing the incidence of incisional hernia. Secondary objectives were to provide recommendations on the prevention of burst abdomen, surgical-site occurrences (SSOs, including wound infection, wound necrosis, wound dehiscence, haematoma, and seroma), and postoperative pain, and improvement in abdominal wall function and cosmesis in patients undergoing abdominal surgery.

Evidence for Good Practice Statements A and B

Four of the included studies considered the safety and outcomes of a watchful waiting approach for incisional hernias. In a large observational series of 23 022 people with an incisional hernia undergoing non-operative management with follow-up of up to 8 years, the risk of an acute hernia event at 1 year was 1.24 per cent, increasing to 2.59 per cent by 5 years. Crossover to elective incisional hernia repair due to symptoms was analysed at two time points, within 3 months from diagnosis (early crossover) and between 3 months and 5 years after diagnosis (late crossover). Crossover at these time points was 21.9 and 9.8 per cent respectively.

Similarly a study including 104 patients reported a crossover to surgery from the watchful waiting group of 32.7 per cent at 4 years. Interestingly, in this study, 8 out of 104 (24 per cent) crossed over due to emergency presentation.

Lauscher et al. divided 90 patients undergoing incisional hernia repair into two groups based on preoperative pain scores on a 0–10 visual analogue scale (VAS) (group one, preoperative VAS score of 0–3 (43 patients); and group two, VAS score of 4–10 (47 patients)). The symptomatic group (group two) showed a significant reduction in clinically relevant pain, from 100 to 14.0 per cent (P < 0.001), whilst, of those in group one, 7.5 per cent had a VAS score greater than 3 at 18 months after surgery, making their symptoms worse. Despite this, the majority of patients in both groups felt that their symptoms were better after surgery (77.5 versus 79.1 per cent), suggesting preoperative pain is not the only important symptom.

Two further articles focused on quality-of-life improvement, measured using Short Form 36 (SF36), in patients undergoing laparoscopic and open incisional hernia repair compared with those awaiting surgery. Both studies reported that the open and laparoscopic incisional hernia repair groups had a significant improvement in quality of life, as measured using SF36, abdominal wall symptoms, and VAS pain scores.

### Cross-sectional E-survey on the incidence of pre-and postoperative chronic pain in bariatric surgery [^115CM1Rf]. Obesity Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, 2.2% of the patients in our survey had preoperative chronic abdominal pain. We observed a twofold increase in abdominal pain postoperatively, which is in accordance with previous reports. Abdominal pain has been identified as the most common postoperative symptom (61.4%) in patients leading to hospital readmissions and reduced health-related quality of life. Therefore, there is a need to conduct longitudinal evaluations before and after bariatric surgery and establish relationships between BMS, patients with obesity, and the development of chronic (abdominal) pain.

There are several speculations regarding the etiology of chronic abdominal pain after bariatric surgery: (1) behavioral and dietary disorders such as over and rapid eating resulting in mechanical distension of the pouch or reduced stomach; (2) functional disorders such as constipation, diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, and dumping syndrome; (3) biliary disorders such as cholelithiasis, choledocholithiasis, or sphincter of Oddi dysfunction; (4) pouch or remaining stomach disorders such as peptic ulcer disease, gastro-gastric fistula, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), hiatus hernia, and internal hernias; and finally (5) disorders in the abdominal wall like anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome (ACNES). However, the pain etiology remains unknown in up to half of all cases with abdominal pain after RYGB, and the association with other forms of bariatric surgery is even less evident.

### Effectiveness of prophylactic intraperitoneal mesh implantation for prevention of incisional hernia in patients undergoing open abdominal surgery: a randomized clinical trial [^116Qa9eE]. JAMA Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Incisional hernia is a frequent complication after open abdominal surgery. Prophylactic mesh implantation in the onlay or sublay position requires dissection of the abdominal wall, potentially leading to wound-associated complications.

Objective

To compare the incidence of incisional hernia among patients after prophylactic intraperitoneal mesh implantation with that among patients after standard abdominal closure.

Design, Setting, and Participants

An open-label randomized clinical trial was performed in 169 patients undergoing elective open abdominal surgery from January 1, 2011, to February 29, 2014. Follow-up examinations were performed 1 year and 3 years after surgery. The study was conducted at Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland, a referral center that offers the whole spectrum of abdominal surgical interventions. Patients with 2 or more of the following risk factors were included: overweight or obesity, diagnosis of neoplastic disease, male sex, or history of previous laparotomy. Patients were randomly assigned to prophylactic intraperitoneal mesh implantation or standard abdominal closure. Data were analyzed in August 2017.

Interventions

Intraperitoneal implantation of a polypropylene-polyvinylidene fluoride mesh with circumferential fixation.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was the incidence of incisional hernia 3 years after surgery. Secondary end points included mesh-related complications.

Results

After the exclusion of 19 patients, 150 patients (81 in the control group and 69 in the mesh group; mean [SD] age, 64.2 [11.1] years; 102 [68.0%] male) were studied. The cumulative incidence of incisional hernia was significantly lower in the mesh group compared with the control group (5 of 69 [7.2%] vs 15 of 81 [18.5%], log-rank test P = 0.03). Abdominal pain was observed in significantly more patients in the mesh group compared with the control group at 6 weeks (34 of 52 [65%] vs 26 of 59 [44%], P = 0.04) but not at 12 and 36 months postoperatively. No difference in surgical site infections was observed, but time to complete wound healing of surgical site infection was significantly longer in patients with mesh implantation (median [interquartile range], 8 [6–24] weeks compared with 5 [1–9] weeks; p = 0.03). Trunk extension was significantly decreased after mesh implantation compared with the control group (mean [SD], 1.73 [0.97] cm vs 2.40 [1.23] cm, P = 0.009).

Conclusions and Relevance

In patients at elevated risk for incisional hernia, prophylactic intraperitoneal mesh implantation reduces the incidence of hernia formation but with increased early postoperative pain and prolonged wound healing of surgical site infection.

Post-bariatric hernias and acute abdominal pain — definitive repair of asymptomatic abdominal wall hernias can be deferred until weight loss has stabilized and nutritional status has improved to allow for adequate wound healing (12 to 18 months after bariatric surgery) (Grade D), whereas symptomatic hernias may require prompt surgical evaluation (Grade C; BEL 3); patients with sudden-onset of severe cramping, periumbilical pain, or recurrent episodes of severe abdominal pain any time after bariatric surgery should be evaluated with an abdominal and pelvic computerized tomography (CT) scan to exclude the potentially life-threatening complication of a closed-loop bowel obstruction (Grade D), and exploratory laparotomy or laparoscopy is indicated when an internal hernia is suspected because the complication can be missed with upper gastrointestinal X-ray studies and CT scans (Grade C; BEL 3).

### Risk factors for chronic pain after open ventral hernia repair by underlay mesh placement [^115emfTe]. World Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Incisional hernia is a frequent complication following abdominal surgery. Repairs that include the use of mesh have been associated with decreased recurrence. The aim of the present study was to determine the outcomes and risk factors for chronic pain after ventral hernia repair with underlay placement of a composite polypropylene mesh.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted from September 2005 to June 2008. The study included consecutive patients who underwent elective incisional hernia repair with underlay composite mesh placement. Postoperative course, recurrence, pain, and patient satisfaction were assessed by an independent observer. Chronic pain was defined as significant pain persisting after 3 months as assessed using a 10-point numeric scale (≥ 3: chronic pain, ≥ 7: severe pain).

Results

After a mean follow-up period of 24.6 months, 109 of 121 patients operated on during the period were evaluated. No patients experienced small bowel obstructions, enterocutaneous fistulas, or mesh infections leading to the need for mesh removal. The recurrence rate was 6.1% at the repair site and 10.5% at another site. Thirty-one patients (28%) had chronic pain and seven patients (6.6%) had severe pain. Affective and nociceptive components were the majority of complaints. Chronic cough was the only variable independently associated with chronic pain in univariate and multivariate analyses (OR = 4.8; p = 0.007).

Conclusions

Intraperitoneal composite mesh placement after ventral hernia repair is safe with regard to intra-abdominal potential complications. Chronic pain is not uncommon, with chronic cough identified as the major independent predictor.

### What are the influencing factors for chronic pain following TAPP inguinal hernia repair: an analysis of 20, 004 patients from the herniamed registry [^116SuTLi]. Surgical Endoscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In inguinal hernia repair, chronic pain must be expected in 10–12% of cases. Around one-quarter of patients (2–4%) experience severe pain requiring treatment. The risk factors for chronic pain reported in the literature include young age, female gender, perioperative pain, postoperative pain, recurrent hernia, open hernia repair, perioperative complications, and penetrating mesh fixation. This present analysis of data from the Herniamed Hernia Registry now investigates the influencing factors for chronic pain in male patients after primary, unilateral inguinal hernia repair in TAPP technique.

Methods

In total, 20,004 patients from the Herniamed Hernia Registry were included in uni- and multivariable analyses. For all patients, 1-year follow-up data were available.

Results

Multivariable analysis revealed that onset of pain at rest, on exertion, and requiring treatment was highly significantly influenced, in each case, by younger age (p < 0.001), preoperative pain (p < 0.001), smaller hernia defect (p < 0.001), and higher BMI (p < 0.001). Other influencing factors were postoperative complications (pain at rest p = 0.004 and pain on exertion p = 0.023) and penetrating compared with glue mesh fixation techniques (pain on exertion p = 0.037).

Conclusions

The indication for inguinal hernia surgery should be very carefully considered in a young patient with a small hernia and preoperative pain.

Results

Q.1. WHICH ARE THE "ALARMING" CLINICAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS FOR ACUTE SURGICAL ABDOMEN IN PATIENTS WITH A PREVIOUS HISTORY OF BARIATRIC SURGERY?

Statement 1.1

Tachycardia ≥ 110 beats per minute, fever ≥ 38 °C, hypotension, respiratory distress with tachypnea and hypoxia, and decreased urine output are alarming clinical signs in patients presenting with acute abdominal pain with a previous history of bariatric surgery (QoE: low).

Statement 1.2

In the presence of respiratory distress and hypoxia, a pulmonary embolism must be systematically excluded (QoE: low).

Statement 1.3

In the absence of fever and other signs of sepsis but in the presence of tachycardia (be aware of patients treated with beta blockers) and acute abdominal pain, patient requires immediate laboratory tests and imaging assessment for early and long-term complications following bariatric surgery (QoE: low).

Statement 1.4

In the emergency setting, the combination of fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea are significant predictors of an anastomotic leak or staple line leak after sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (QoE: low).

Statement 1.5

Persisting vomiting and nausea are alarming clinical signs due to the high probability of complications such as internal hernia, volvulus, gastrointestinal stenosis, intestinal ischemia, or marginal ulcer after bariatric surgery (QoE: low).

Statement 1.6

The most common clinical presentation of internal hernia after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is acute onset, persistent crampy/colicky abdominal pain, mostly located in the epigastrium (QoE: low).

Statement 1.7

The triad of persistent epigastric pain, pregnancy, and a history of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass should be warning signs for the prompt evaluation of the patient for the high suspicion of internal hernia (QoE: low).

Statement 1.8

Any clinical signs of intestinal bleeding such as hematemesis, melena, and hematochezia after bariatric surgery are predictors signs of intra-abdominal complications (QoE: low).

KQ6 Are postoperative abdominal binders advantageous after open abdominal surgery?

Since the previous guideline, three systematic reviews and meta-analysesof the use of abdominal binders have been published, all including a different set of RCTs and observational studies. One systematic reviewincluded eight studies, of which were four RCTs, comprising a total of 578 patients. No effect on postoperative pain was found. Use of abdominal binders did not compromise pulmonary function. The other two meta-analyses, including 10 (968 patients)and five (281 patients)RCTs reported a reduction in postoperative pain with abdominal binders and no negative effect on pulmonary function. Abdominal binders can be used after open abdominal surgery, but their costs, acceptance by patients, and potential risks should be taken into account. No recommendations can be given in terms of SSO, burst abdomen, and incisional hernia formation as there are a lack of data on these outcomes.

KQ7 Is restriction of activity advantageous after open abdominal surgery?

Only one systematic reviewon the restriction of activity after abdominal surgery has been published. This included 22 studies, incorporating three RCTs and several opinion articles. No comparative prospective trials on pulmonary function, SSO, burst abdomen, and incisional hernia formation were included. Therefore, no recommendations can be given on the restriction of postoperative physical activities owing to lack of studies. An expert surveyof recommendations regarding postoperative strain and physical labour after abdominal surgery was undertaken during the 41st Annual International Congress of the EHS. Four weeks of no physical strain after laparotomy was considered appropriate by a majority of the experts.

### Management of chronic pain after hernia repair [^111Lh6b5]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Watchful waiting

First-line management of chronic pain following inguinal hernia repair is to examine the patient and explain the condition. Since pain is declining with time after surgery, a watchful strategy can be tried in the beginning. However, a lifestyle change to sedentary activities is not recommended, and chronic pain can severely affect quality of life. Basic analgesics can be used in the period of watchful waiting. If there are no improvements in the condition after a few months, then systematic pharmacological interventions should be tried, preferably in collaboration with pain specialists. If the pain is bearable, it is import to inform the patient that pain will, for many patients, diminish with time.

### Risk factors for long-term pain after hernia surgery [^116DKDD7]. Annals of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the prevalence of residual pain 2 to 3 years after hernia surgery, to identify factors associated with its occurrence, and to assess the consequences for the patient.

Summary Background Data

Iatrogenic chronic pain is a neglected problem that may totally annul the benefits from hernia repair.

Methods

From the population-based Swedish Hernia Register 3000 patients aged 15 to 85 years were sampled from the 9280 patients registered as having undergone a primary groin hernia operation in the year 2000. Of these, the 2853 patients still alive in 2003 were requested to fill in a postal questionnaire.

Results

After 2 reminders, 2456 patients (86%), 2299 men and 157 women responded. In response to a question about "worst perceived pain last week", 758 patients (31%) reported pain to some extent. In 144 cases (6%), the pain interfered with daily activities. Age below median, a high level of pain before the operation, and occurrence of any postoperative complication were found to significantly and independently predict long-term pain in multivariate logistic analysis when "worst pain last week" was used as outcome variable. The same variables, along with a repair technique using anterior approach, were found to predict long-term pain with "pain right now" as outcome variable.

Conclusion

Pain that is at least partly disabling appears to occur more often than recurrences. The prevalence of long-term pain can be reduced by preventing postoperative complications. The impact of repair technique on the risk of long-term pain shown in our study should be further assessed in randomized controlled trials.

### Is chronic post-herniorrhaphy pain always chronic? A literature review [^112vWuXz]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Literature review

A PubMed search from January 1980 to June 2014 was carried out with the search terms "Postherniorrhaphy pain" or "Long-term post-surgery pain and Hernia" or "Chronic postoperative pain and Hernia". Inclusion criteria were studies including assessment of persisting pain on at least two defined occasions postoperatively at defined intervals, the second occasion being at least 1 year after surgery. Pain estimates within 3 months after surgery were not included in the present review since pain present during the first postoperative months is usually not considered as chronic and may be related to other factors than those that cause pain of longer persistence. Studies describing the same study group in two separate publications were also included. In the case of randomized controlled trials, the randomization arms were considered as separate groups. The following studies were excluded:
studies with only one estimate of pain prevalence;
studies with poorly or undefined follow-up intervals;
studies with incomplete follow-up;
studies not including pain as endpoint or defining pain in a way that made it impossible to dichotomize it.

### Updated guideline for closure of abdominal wall incisions from the European and American hernia societies [^1129HRVY]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Limitations

These updated guidelines summarize the studies of abdominal wall closure in adults undergoing abdominal surgery. The major limitation of this guideline reflects the limited quantity and/or quality of the studies available to answer the KQs. This makes it impossible to formulate strong recommendations for any of the KQs according to the GRADE methodology. The majority of studies reported on the incidence of burst abdomen, SSI, and incisional hernia. Patient-reported outcomes, such as pain, abdominal wall function and cosmesis, were reported rarely. Data were limited or lacking for emergency surgery and surgery in obese patients, and recommendations for these patients could not be made. Although the guidelines group aimed to represent all stakeholders and surgical specialties, it would have benefited from participation of a gynaecological surgeon and physiotherapist. Care was taken to create subgroups without group members who authored a paper relevant to the KQ or with other conflicts of interest. However, all group members use meshes and sutures, and are involved in hernia prevention, which might have influenced appraisal of the evidence and formulation of recommendations. Efforts were made to have active patient participation, but unfortunately not all group meetings had patient representation. A patient representative critically reviewed the guidelines and their valuable comments were included.

Implementation

To aid dissemination and implementation, the guideline will be presented at international and national conferences, and summaries will be written in different languages for national journals. Implementation of standard closure techniques in elective and emergency laparotomies has been described in detail, and shown to reduce the incidence of incisional hernia and burst abdomen. Before implementation of the recommendations, surgeons may need some extra education and/or training in the techniques. Monitoring of this process, complications, and feedback are important. Surgical procedures can be performed in different positions (such as lateral) and on patients in special conditions (for example, pregnancy), which require special considerations when choosing location of incision, approach, and closure techniques. For these reasons, separate papers on the applicability of the guidelines specifically for urological, gynaecological and vascular procedures and patients will be written. Another barrier to implementation of these guidelines may be the added costs of, and time taken, for a surgical procedure, especially in low- and middle-income countries. However, reduction in the incidence of incisional hernia has been proven to reduce healthcare costs, and even the use of prophylactic mesh has been calculated to be more cost-effective than suture closure alone. Given the additional studies identified for this update, it is planned to update these guidelines 5 years after publication using the GRADE methodology.

Interventions and management of chronic pain

Authors of a recent review aimed to characterize management and treatment strategies for chronic postoperative pain; however, the authors of the review concluded that there was a lack of evidence, making it impossible to draw firm conclusions regarding effectiveness or harm. A problem might be to investigate all interventions to treat all postoperative chronic pain conditions, and it is likely that each of the different procedures resulting in chronic pain needs to have their own specific treatment and diagnostic algorithm.

For chronic pain following inguinal hernia surgery, a range of interventions can be used to treat or manage the chronic pain. Interventions include watchful waiting, pharmacological treatments, local anesthetic blocks, sensory stimulation or ablation of nerves, and surgery (mesh removal, reoperation for recurrence, and neurectomy).

### What are the influencing factors for chronic pain following TAPP inguinal hernia repair: an analysis of 20, 004 patients from the herniamed registry [^115DiVSK]. Surgical Endoscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In inguinal hernia repair, chronic pain must be expected in 10–12% of cases. Around one-quarter of patients (2–4%) experience severe pain requiring treatment. The risk factors for chronic pain reported in the literature include young age, female gender, perioperative pain, postoperative pain, recurrent hernia, open hernia repair, perioperative complications, and penetrating mesh fixation. This present analysis of data from the Herniamed Hernia Registry now investigates the influencing factors for chronic pain in male patients after primary, unilateral inguinal hernia repair in TAPP technique.

Methods

In total, 20,004 patients from the Herniamed Hernia Registry were included in uni- and multivariable analyses. For all patients, 1-year follow-up data were available.

Results

Multivariable analysis revealed that onset of pain at rest, on exertion, and requiring treatment was highly significantly influenced, in each case, by younger age (p < 0.001), preoperative pain (p < 0.001), smaller hernia defect (p < 0.001), and higher BMI (p < 0.001). Other influencing factors were postoperative complications (pain at rest p = 0.004 and pain on exertion p = 0.023) and penetrating compared with glue mesh fixation techniques (pain on exertion p = 0.037).

Conclusions

The indication for inguinal hernia surgery should be very carefully considered in a young patient with a small hernia and preoperative pain.

### Groin hernia [^114R1JuK]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2025). High credibility.

Groin hernias are among the most common indications for surgery worldwide, affecting both men and women, with a significantly higher prevalence in men. These hernias occur when intra-abdominal contents protrude through a weakened area in the groin region, most commonly as inguinal or femoral hernias. The pathogenesis of groin hernias is a complex interplay of genetic predisposition, connective tissue abnormalities and mechanical strain. While watchful waiting is an option for some asymptomatic patients, surgical repair remains the definitive treatment, with both open and minimally invasive techniques available. Tension-free mesh repair has significantly reduced the overall recurrence rates and is now the standard approach in adults in most clinics. However, tissue-based repairs are still preferred in select populations such as children, teenagers and those in resource-limited settings. Advances in laparoscopic and robotic-assisted techniques offer benefits such as reduced postoperative pain and faster recovery. Despite surgical advancements, complications, such as chronic postoperative pain and recurrence, continue to pose challenges. Future research aims to refine surgical techniques, look at mesh-related complications, develop bioengineered meshes and explore the genetic basis of hernia formation.

### Laparoscopy for abdominal emergencies: evidence-based guidelines of the European Association for Endoscopic Surgery [^111fBFuQ]. Surgical Endoscopy (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Emergency laparoscopic exploration can be used to identify the causative pathology of acute abdominal pain. Laparoscopic surgery also allows treatment of many intraabdominal disorders. This report was prepared to describe the effectiveness of laparoscopic surgery compared to laparotomy or nonoperative treatment.

Methods

A panel of European experts in abdominal and gynecological surgery was assembled and participated in a consensus conference using Delphi methods. The aim was to develop evidence-based recommendations for the most common diseases that may cause acute abdominal pain.

Recommendations

Laparoscopic surgery was found to be clearly superior for patients with a presumable diagnosis of perforated peptic ulcer, acute cholecystitis, appendicitis, or pelvic inflammatory disease. In the emergency setting, laparoscopy is of unclear or limited value if adhesive bowel obstruction, acute diverticulitis, nonbiliary pancreatitis, hernia incarceration, or mesenteric ischemia are suspected. In stable patients with acute abdominal pain, noninvasive diagnostics should be fully exhausted before considering explorative surgery. However, diagnostic laparoscopy may be useful if no diagnosis can be found by conventional diagnostics. More clinical data are needed on the use of laparoscopy after blunt or penetrating trauma of the abdomen.

Conclusions

Due to diagnostic and therapeutic advantages, laparoscopic surgery is useful for the majority of conditions underlying acute abdominal pain, but noninvasive diagnostic aids should be exhausted first. Depending on symptom severity, laparoscopy should be advocated if routine diagnostic procedures have failed to yield results.

### The association of permanent versus absorbable fixation on developing chronic post-herniorrhaphy groin pain in patients undergoing laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair [^116nMVUs]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

In the USA, an estimated 800,000 inguinal hernia operations are done annually, with up to 1 in 4 men and 1 in 30 women undergoing a repair in their lifetime. With the advent of minimally invasive surgery, the trend has shifted toward laparoscopic approaches, such as the totally extraperitoneal (TEP) or trans-abdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair techniques, both of which commonly include placement and fixation of mesh. While postoperative complications are rare, post-herniorrhaphy groin pain is a relatively common adverse outcome.

However, the etiology of this pain is not well understood and is likely multifactorial in nature. Age, gender, BMI, preoperative pain level, hernia size, presence of postoperative complications and history of prior inguinal hernia repair have all previously been identified as potential predictors for postoperative pain. Additionally, there exists controversy surrounding the impact of fixation on post-herniorrhaphy groin pain. Permanent titanium tacks have historically been used, but a number of reported complications and their possible association with severe postoperative pain has generated concern regarding the type of tacks that should be used for fixation. Though few studies have definitively identified a significant effect of permanent fixation on pain, the theoretical concern has led to the development of more costly alternatives, such as absorbable tacks.

The effect of permanent versus absorbable fixation on chronic post-herniorrhaphy groin pain after inguinal hernia repair has been assessed in only a handful of studies with small patient cohorts. Comparatively, it has been evaluated in more studies in incisional or ventral hernias. The data there has not shown an increased risk of chronic post-herniorrhaphy groin pain with permanent tacks and therefore, no conclusive data exist to justify the use of the more expensive absorbable tacks for fixation. Still, randomized controlled trials were relatively small and lacked long-term follow-up of pain. We aim in this study to compare the rates of chronic post-herniorrhaphy groin pain after laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair between permanent versus absorbable tack fixation at maximum follow-up of a large cohort of patients.

### Updated guideline for closure of abdominal wall incisions from the European and American hernia societies [^114QeeGL]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Two systematic reviews of SILS focused on cholecystectomies in 2838 patients, and SILS for a variety of surgical procedures in 3340 patients. Both meta-analyses showed an increased risk of incisional hernia after SILS compared with conventional laparoscopy, with an OR of over 2.5. Although the RCTs included in these large meta-analyses were of acceptable methodological quality, the majority of the studies were not sufficiently powered for the outcome incisional hernia. Some studies had insufficient follow-up or a poorly described method of incisional hernia detection. The meta-analysisof cholecystectomies did not show a difference between SSO or postoperative pain between SILS and conventional laparoscopy. Because SILS requires a larger fascial incision than conventional laparoscopy and carries a higher risk of incisional or trocar-site hernia, these incisions should be closed meticulously, as recommended in the original guidelines.

As no additional evidence regarding trocar size, trocar location or fascial closure was found, the recommendation from the previous guideline on trocar size was not changed.

### Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair: early follow-up of a randomized controlled study of primary fascial closure before mesh placement [^112ZL7fT]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Suturing of the hernia aperture in laparoscopic ventral hernia repair has increased during the past decade. The primary aim of this is to restore the anatomy of the abdominal wall. Closure of the aperture, however, may cause additional tension in the abdominal wall which could increase postoperative pain. The aim of this study was to investigate whether suturing of the hernia aperture affects postoperative pain and hernia-site complications, including seroma, infection, pseudohernia, and mesh migration, 3 months after repair.

Methods

Some 192 patients with a midline hernia between 2 and 8cm in transverse diameter were included in a randomized controlled double-blinded multicentre study. Patients were randomized to mesh repair with (intervention) or without (control) suturing of the hernia aperture before mesh placement. Patients completed the Ventral Hernia Pain Questionnaire before and 3 months after surgery. Abdominal wall pain and hernia-site complications were assessed 3 months after surgery.

Results

Ninety-seven patients were randomized to the intervention group and 95 to the control group. Among all patients, median age and BMI was 56 years and 31kg/m² respectively. Overall pain experienced decreased by 3 months after operation (P < 0.001). There was no difference between groups regarding hernia-site complications or pain experienced during the past week (13 versus 23 patients; P = 0.111). Seroma and pseudohernia occurred in 13 and 11 patients in the intervention and control groups respectively (P = 0.975 and P = 0.977).

Conclusion

Restoration of the abdominal wall anatomy by suturing the hernia aperture before mesh placement does not increase the risk of hernia-site complication or pain 3 months after surgery. This implies that fascial suturing of the aperture can be justified if there are potential long-term benefits such as lower recurrence and/or complication rates.

### Chronic pain after laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal hernia repair: a randomized comparison of light and extralight titanized polypropylene mesh [^112FKpW1]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most commonly performed operations in the world. Every year almost 60,000 inguinal hernia repairs (IHR) using transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) and extraperitoneal (TEP) techniques are performed in Germany. In the majority of cases postoperative recovery is without complications and return to normal activities is possible within 1 week. However, some patients complain about postoperative pain for several weeks and some suffer from chronic groin pain for months or even for years. Chronic pain was defined as "lasting for 3 months or more" using the definition of the International Association for the Study of Pain. In their meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, McCormack et al. found the incidence of chronic pain after inguinal hernia repair using the TAPP technique to be at 13.8%. In the literature, several risk factors for chronic inguinal pain are mentioned. These are young age, female gender, medial hernia, open repair technique, postoperative complications, need for operation for recurrence, presence of preoperative pain, neurotoxic chemotherapy, depression, neuroticism, anxiety, and an observation period of fewer than 3 years after surgery. However, the staples used for mesh fixation and the alloplastic mesh itself may also be major causes for chronic postoperative pain.

Animal studies proved that there is a correlation between the weight, biocompatibility, and shrinkage of polypropylene meshes. There have been numerous clinical reports pointing out the tendency of implanted mesh to shrink extensively and migrate and penetrate neighboring organs, have an oversized load of material, and cause an associated chronic inflammatory reaction and even carcinogenic effects. A great effort was put into the development of meshes that have improved biocompatibility.

Since 2001 titanium-covered polypropylene meshes, referring to a new type of compound material, are available. The titanium is covalently bonded to the alloplastic surface of the mesh. There is evidence from animal experiments that the titanium-coated polypropylene meshes induce a less pronounced foreign body reaction (i.e. less shrinkage) compared with identical meshes lacking a titanium coating.

To improve the outcome for their patients some surgeons have begun performing inguinal hernia repair using these titanized meshes. However, it was not clear which mesh to use for which kind of hernia, and it was also not clear how the 35-g/m² (Light) and the 16-g/m² (Extralight) versions differed concerning the rate of recurrence or chronic pain.

### Groin hernia repair: postherniorrhaphy pain [^116yBXXy]. World Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Persistent pain after hernia repair is common, although it is usually mild. In 3% of patients it is severe, however, and has significant effects on work and social activities. The purpose of this review was to examine factors that affect pain after hernia repair. Although the type of anaesthetic used, local or general, and the operation type, open or laparoscopic, seems to affect acute pain, chronic persistent pain is influenced by the age of the patient and whether the hernia was painful preoperatively. Preliminary evidence indicating that use of a lightweight mesh may reduce chronic pain requires further research before definitive conclusions can be drawn.

### Pain control following inguinal herniorrhaphy: current perspectives [^112TZE7B]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most common surgeries performed worldwide. With the success of modern hernia repair techniques, recurrence rates have significantly declined, with a lower incidence than the development of chronic postherniorrhaphy inguinal pain (CPIP). The avoidance of CPIP is arguably the most important clinical outcome and has the greatest impact on patient satisfaction, health care utilization, societal cost, and quality of life. The etiology of CPIP is multifactorial, with overlapping neuropathic and nociceptive components contributing to this complex syndrome. Treatment is often challenging, and no definitive treatment algorithm exists. Multidisciplinary management of this complex problem improves outcomes, as treatment must be individualized. Current medical, pharmacologic, interventional, and surgical management strategies are reviewed.

Bariatric postoperative obstruction and abdominal pain (R72) — In patients who have undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD/DS), a computed tomography (CT) is the most appropriate imaging tool to identify intestinal obstruction or internal hernia, and if findings are missed on imaging, diagnostic laparoscopy should be considered if symptoms persist. Severe abdominal pain after sleeve gastrectomy (SG) may be due to mesenteric venous thrombosis associated with shorter courses of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis and is best diagnosed with contrast-enhanced CT. A multi-institutional, matched, case-controlled U.S. database study from 2008–2012 reported 15 cases of inflammatory bowel disease in those with a prior history of bariatric surgery with OR 1.93 (95% CI 1.34 to 2.79) among 8,980 patients in the study group and 43,059 controls.

Postoperative pain after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) is variable; acute postoperative pain should be resolved by 4–6 weeks and the incidence of protracted pain ranges from 1.6–28%. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications have been utilized with success for persistent postoperative pain, whereas elastomeric pumps delivering bupivicaine above the mesh have not been shown to influence acute postoperative pain. Topical anesthetic patches reduce pain scores after LVHR but the clinical significance is uncertain; successful relief of protracted pain has also been demonstrated with injections of either a local anesthetic or a combination of local anesthetic and steroid, and intercostal nerve blocks have also been successfully employed for chronic postoperative pain. Excision of sutures or tacks has been reported to result in pain resolution in some circumstances.

### Abdominal hernia… [^113E8ruW]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

The first symptom of a hernia is usually a small bulging under the skin that is generally painless but may produce discomfort and get larger during strenuous activities or coughing. At this stage, the hernia is reducible because its contents can be pushed back into the abdomen. However, if the hernia grows, it may become incarcerated. If blood stops flowing through an incarcerated bowel, this results in strangulation, which is accompanied by pain, often with nausea, vomiting, or constipation. Risk factors Family history of hernia Being male Obesity Pregnancy Weight lifting, coughing, straining during bowel movement Cystic fibrosis and chronic lung infections Previous abdominal surgery Complications. A hernia may result in entrapment of other organs or nerves, producing constipation or problems with urination or sexual function.

A strangulated hernia is a surgical emergency because part of the bowel may become necrotic, resulting in life-threatening peritonitis needing surgical removal of part of the bowel. If you have a hernia and significant abdominal pain, pain over the hernia, or nausea or vomiting, you should seek medical care immediately. Treatment Initial treatment of a minor hernia includes avoiding heavy lifting and strenuous exercises and, sometimes, wearing a support. It used to be thought that all hernias should be repaired. However, recent evidence suggests that repair should be performed only if significant discomfort or pain is associated with the hernia. The operation to repair a hernia is called a herniorrhaphy. When the gap is large, a plastic mesh may be used for reinforcement of muscles of the abdominal wall.

Use of mesh reduces the risk of the hernia recurring, but the mesh material can become infected. In some cases, hernia repairs may be performed laparoscopically, although this approach has not been shown to be better than traditional open operations. TOPIC: SURGERY Pluta RM, Burke AE, Golub RM.

### Publication trends and hot spots in chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) research: a 10-year bibliometric analysis [^116j6NPr]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Our analysis of the highly cited articles and keywords revealed that the word "risk factor", ie, the prediction of CPSP, was the current hot spot in the CPSP field. The foremost critical factor leading to the development of CPSP involves neuropathic pain caused by nerve injury during surgery. Indeed as pointed out in the most cited review article involving CPSP by Haroutiunian et al 2013, persistent postoperative pain was most often reported as neuropathic pain. Moreover, it is considered that CPSP was closely related to the type of surgeryand this notion is supported by data showing differing CPSP incidences. The reported rates of CPSP occurring in surgeries in the thoracic/breast area, bone and joint surgeries and surgeries on abdominal visceral structures were about 30–35%, 20 and 10–14%, respectively. The most influential publication detected involved a multicenter cohort study published by Montes and colleagues in Anesthesiology in 2015 also has a similar view. In addition, these authors grouped the risk models into six clinical predictors: surgical procedure, age, physical health, mental health, preoperative pain in the surgical field, and preoperative pain in another area. Indeed, pre-existing pain may lead to the development of persistent pain after surgery. The intensity of acute pain after breast surgery, thoracotomy, and inguinal hernia repair was also associated with the subsequent development of chronic pain. As for psychological factors, the theory on the development of CPSP had changed from a biomedical model to a biological, psychological, and social model. Anxiety, fear, past memories, social environment, expectations of work and physical activity, and other psychological issues were all thought to affect the development of CPSP. Taken together, this illustrates that the different CPSP risk factors operate interdependently. Moreover, due to the diverse and interactive nature of the factors involved in CPSP development, the prediction and prevention of CPSP had become complicated and cumbersome. Research on the pathogenesis of CPSP is also relatively scattered, and a systematic and recognized theory has not yet fully formed.

### Genome-wide association study on chronic postsurgical pain after abdominal surgeries in the UK biobank [^115BxAuW]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic postsurgical pain is pain that develops or increases in intensity beyond the normal healing process, lasting 3 months or longer, after surgery. Severe chronic postsurgical pain can affect the physical and psychological wellbeing of patients, leading to reduced quality of life, limitations in physical activities, emotional distress and sleep disturbances.

The prevalence of chronic postsurgical pain varies from 5% to 85% in different types of surgeries. A surgical category of particular interest is abdominal surgery, one of the most common and painful types of surgery. The lifetime risk of undergoing abdominal surgery in developed countries is over 50%, and the estimated incidence of chronic postsurgical pain is anywhere from 10% to 50% depending on the type of surgery (e.g. cholecystectomy, herniorrhaphy, laparotomy) and surveying methods. Considering the large number of surgical procedures performed annually (estimated 310 million major surgeries per year worldwide) and that abdominal surgeries accounting for more than 50% of major surgeries, the burden of chronic postsurgical pain following abdominal surgery is considerable.

Despite the significant negative effects of chronic postsurgical pain on quality of life and physical wellbeing, chronic postsurgical pain is still widely underdiagnosed and often poorly treated. Ideally, successful pain management should involve healthcare providers implementing pre‐operative interventions tailored to a patient's genetic risk profile and adapt their peri‐operative care accordingly, thereby mitigating the risk of chronic postsurgical pain and enhancing overall patient outcomes. This approach necessitates the identification of patients at high risk of developing chronic postsurgical pain by implementing high‐quality clinical prediction models for risk stratification. Building such prediction models requires a comprehensive understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying chronic postsurgical pain development. Several peri‐operative risk factors have been identified, including demographic characteristics (age and sex); and clinical factors (psychosocial factors, preceding pain). Incorporating genetic risk factors into prediction models is likely to improve the accuracy of chronic postsurgical pain risk assessment. However, the genetic variants contributing to chronic postsurgical pain development have yet to be elucidated fully.

### Chronic pain after laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal hernia repair: a randomized comparison of light and extralight titanized polypropylene mesh [^112wsQZm]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

What causes the pain in those patients still suffering after 3 years? In addition to the mesh there is surgical trauma, direct nerve injury, and the use of staples that may have also played a role here. There are numerous published reports of nerve entrapment by tacks placed during laparoscopic repair. Laparoscopic hernia repair without the use of tacks has been described and it eliminates the risk of misplaced tacks. In addition, it is more cost effective because staplers are expensive. Others do advise to use staples because the rate of recurrence may be reduced. In the present study, staples were used in both groups to an equal extent. The rate of recurrence was the same in both groups but not the rate of chronic pain. The role of staples as a major cause of chronic inguinal pain cannot be supported by our data.

Definitions and types of pain

Chronic (postoperative) pain has been defined as pain lasting at least 2–3 months (after surgery), but modifications are proposed to this timeframe. A group of experts in hernia surgery and chronic pain has suggested modifying the definition for chronic pain after hernia repair as pain lasting at least 6 months after operation. The reason for this extended period of time is because the inflammation around the mesh is still ongoing after 3 months, and there is a chance that some patients will improve substantially from 3 to 6 months postoperatively.

Surgery

If other treatments (watchful waiting, systemic analgesics, and injections) have been tried and failed, it should be considered to operate the patients for their pain (Figure 1). Different surgical approaches can be used to remove the mesh, perform a neurectomy, or a combination of both. Neurectomy can be performed via an anterior open approach or via a posterior laparoscopic technique. Surgical strategy will be determined by the initial technique for inguinal hernia repair. Following anterior approaches, a repeated anterior approach with neurectomy and mesh removal is recommended. Following posterior approaches (ie, laparoscopy), a posterior approach is recommended with exploration of the field and removal of tacks and mesh.

If it is thought that the mesh is causing the problem, and not a recurrence, a surgical removal of the mesh should be considered. The pain can be due to damage to the nerves caused by the mesh, but simply removal of the mesh might not reverse the neuropathic pain. Peroperatively, the nerves might seem normal without macroscopically visible damage, but there can still be ultrastructural damages to the nerves that will cause pain and even the removal of the mesh might not reverse the damage and the patient might still have pain. It is therefore recommended to always conduct a triple neurectomy since it is difficult if not impossible to diagnose which nerves are involved in the pain, and a subsequent surgical procedure in the scarred surgical field after mesh removal may be difficult. Thus, when performing mesh removal after a previous Lichtenstein repair, it is recommended to remove as much of the mesh as possible (preferably all mesh material) together with triple neurectomy anterior to the annulus, ie, outside of the abdominal cavity without dissection behind the transversalis fascia.

Surgical treatment of pain following a posterior approach such as laparoscopy can be divided in two methods. The first method is to remove tacks and mesh with a laparoscopic approach. The second method is a neurectomy that should be reserved for skilled hands.

The laparoscopic retroperitoneal triple neurectomy has been developed to avoid the scared field of the groin after open approaches and in order to conduct neurectomy proximal to the nerves following preperitoneal or intraperitoneal approaches. In a highly selected group of patients (62 out of 567 with chronic pain after inguinal hernia repair), 95% of patients experienced decrease of their pain to "manageable levels" after laparoscopic retroperitoneal triple neurectomy.

### Laparoscopic groin hernia repair… [^113E8685]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

Hewitt DB, Chojnacki K. Laparoscopic Groin Hernia Repair. JAMA. 2017; 318:

1294. doi: 10.1001/jama.2017.11620 Laparoscopic hernia repair is performed with general anesthesia and requires use of a breathing tube. Three half-inch or smaller incisions are made in the lower part of the abdomen. In laparoscopic hernia repair, a camera called a laparoscope is inserted into the abdomen to visualize the hernia defect on a monitor. The image on the monitor is used to guide the surgeon's movements. The hernia sac is removed from the defect in the abdominal wall, and a prosthetic mesh is then placed to cover the hernia defect. While doing this, surgeons are careful to avoid injuring the nerves that are near the hernia, blood vessels that can bleed, or the vas deferens. The small incisions are closed with stitches that dissolve on their own over time.

You should discuss all hernia repair options with your surgeon to determine which approach is best for you. Most patients can expect soreness over the first 1 to 2 days after surgery. Take pain medication as prescribed by your surgeon. Some patients may experience bruising in and around the groin area. This is normal. However, if there is significant swelling in the groin, you should contact your surgeon. You should walk every day but limit strenuous activity such as running and lifting anything over 5 to 10 lb until evaluated by your surgeon at your postoperative visit 1 to 2 weeks after surgery. In general, if an activity hurts, it shouldn't be done. Constipation and straining during bowel movements increases the pressure on the repair and should be avoided; eat a high-fiber diet and use stool softeners if needed. Contact your surgeon if you experience fever higher than 100.

### Pain control following inguinal herniorrhaphy: current perspectives [^113os3No]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most common surgical procedures in the world. Annually, more than 20 million inguinal hernia repairs are conducted worldwide, and in the US alone the number reaches 800,000.–In industrialized countries, lifetime risk for undergoing reparative surgery of inguinal hernia has been estimated to be 27% for men, and 3% for women. For a majority of patients, the operative correction of an inguinal hernia is successful with a minimum of postoperative sequelae, followed by a few weeks convalescenceand no long-term complications. However, considering the vast number of patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair, any, even rare, severe long-term complication would be of great impact.

The techniques of operative repair, or herniorrhaphy, have been refined over the last decades and have resulted in open and laparoscopic tension-free approaches utilizing advanced prosthetic mesh-material as gold standard. Consequently, hernia recurrence rates have decreased dramatically (1%–5%), and today, chronic pain is instead recognized as the most significant complication. Chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) has been defined as pain that develops after surgical intervention and lasts for at least 2 months, other causes of pain excluded.CPSP has been historically reported with every common operation, including appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and cesarian section.

Discussion

This review aimed to provide an overview of possible strategies for the treatment of chronic pain after inguinal hernia surgery. At the moment, there is not a single treatment or management strategy that will be appropriate for all patients. Experts and expert-based guidelines recommend to use a scaled intervention, meaning that the patient should start out with watchful waiting, especially in the first 6 months, and then, systemic pain killers and if that cannot relieve the pain, injections should be tried; surgical treatment should be considered as the final option. It is also recommended to always consult a surgeon or, preferably, a regional or a national center with the expertise in chronic pain following inguinal hernia surgery since causes and treatments vary from patient to patient and because one strategy might not fit all.

Several guidelines exist in this area; however, they are mostly based on expert opinions and personal experience and less on solid high-quality evidence. A regional, national, or maybe even international setup should be in place in order to deal with the most severe and complex cases. This allows for gathering of expertise and ensures that patients are uniformly treated and receive the best standard of care for this condition. An international collaboration could be beneficial in order to share knowledge and collect data for development of treatments. It is likely that the individual surgeon does not see their own patients with chronic pain if the patients go to a different surgeon or institution. Thus, just for reoperation for recurrence, up to 25% of patients go to a different hospital than for the primary repair.

In general, there is a high need for evidence regarding chronic postsurgical pain management, not only for pain following inguinal hernia surgery but also for pain following many different kinds of surgery. The treatment of chronic postoperative pain is difficult, and a simple treatment that works well for all has not been found. Therefore, individualized management is becoming more important, and the optimal management is what every surgeon or doctor treating these patients should aim for.

### Genetic and clinical factors associated with chronic postsurgical pain after hernia repair, hysterectomy, and thoracotomy: a two-year multicenter cohort study [^112Mb7h5]. Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) has been linked to many surgical settings. The authors aimed to analyze functional genetic polymorphisms and clinical factors that might identify CPSP risk after inguinal hernia repair, hysterectomy, and thoracotomy.

Methods

This prospective multicenter cohort study enrolled 2,929 patients scheduled for inguinal hernia repair, hysterectomy (vaginal or abdominal), or thoracotomy. The main outcome was the incidence of CPSP confirmed by physical examination 4 months after surgery. The secondary outcome was CPSP incidences at 12 and 24 months. The authors also tested the associations between CPSP and 90 genetic markers plus a series of clinical factors and built a CPSP risk model.

Results

Within a median of 4.4 months, CPSP had developed in 527 patients (18.0%), in 13.6% after hernia repair, 11.8% after vaginal hysterectomy, 25.1% after abdominal hysterectomy, and 37.6% after thoracotomy. CPSP persisted after a median of 14.6 months and 26.3 months in 6.2% and 4.1%, respectively, after hernia repair, 4.1% and 2.2% after vaginal hysterectomy, 9.9% and 6.7% after abdominal hysterectomy, and 19.1% and 13.2% after thoracotomy. No significant genetic differences between cases and controls were identified. The risk model included six clinical predictors: (1) surgical procedure, (2) age, (3) physical health (Short Form Health Survey-12), (4) mental health (Short Form Health Survey-12), (5) preoperative pain in the surgical field, and (6) preoperative pain in another area. Discrimination was moderate (c-statistic, 0.731; 95% CI, 0.705 to 0.755).

Conclusions

Until unequivocal genetic predictors of CPSP are understood, the authors encourage systematic use of clinical factors for predicting and managing CPSP risk.

### Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair: early follow-up of a randomized controlled study of primary fascial closure before mesh placement [^116TYpK2]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Pain after abdominal wall surgery is a multifactorial problem. Contributing factors include tissue dissection, mesh fixation, mesh material, and factors yet unknown. Postoperative pain is difficult to prevent and treat. Acute pain is unavoidable after surgery, but this is controlled pharmacologically and usually resolves within days. For some patients, however, acute postoperative pain persists beyond the usual time for tissue healing and becomes chronic. Chronic postoperative pain might occur at the site of incision, fixation or related areas, and persists for longer than it takes for injured tissue to heal. The incidence of chronic pain after LVHR has been reported to be in the region of 17%.

Fixation of the mesh to the abdominal wall appears to be the most important cause of postoperative pain, but the effect of suturing the fascial defect has not been evaluated. PROSECO (Prospective RandOmized Study of Endoscopic fascia Closure and long-term Outcome) is a double-blinded RCT comparing suture with non-suture of the fascial defect during LVHR. It was hypothesized that the hernia-site complication rate would be lower 3 months after LVHR if the hernia aperture were sutured, and that the degree of postoperative pain, as measured with a validated pain questionnaire, would be higher. This article reports results from the PROSECO trial 3 months after surgery.

### Abdominal wall pain: clinical evaluation, differential diagnosis, and treatment [^111dEmsX]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Abdominal wall pain is often mistaken for intra-abdominal visceral pain, resulting in expensive and unnecessary laboratory tests, imaging studies, consultations, and invasive procedures. Those evaluations generally are nondiagnostic, and lingering pain can become frustrating to the patient and clinician. Common causes of abdominal wall pain include nerve entrapment, hernia, and surgical or procedural complications. Anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome is the most common and frequently missed type of abdominal wall pain. This condition typically presents with acute or chronic localized pain at the lateral edge of the rectus abdominis that worsens with position changes or increased abdominal muscle tension. Abdominal wall pain should be suspected in patients with no symptoms or signs of visceral etiology and a localized small tender spot. A positive Carnett test, in which tenderness stays the same or worsens when the patient tenses the abdominal muscles, suggests abdominal wall pain. A local anesthetic injection can confirm the diagnosis when there is 50% postprocedural pain improvement. Point-of-care ultrasonography may help rule out other abdominal wall pathologies and guide injections. The management of abdominal wall pain depends on the etiology. Reassurance and patient education can be helpful. Local injection with an anesthetic and a corticosteroid is an effective treatment for anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome, with an overall response rate of 70% to 99%. For refractory cases that require more than two injections, surgical neurectomy generally resolves the pain.
