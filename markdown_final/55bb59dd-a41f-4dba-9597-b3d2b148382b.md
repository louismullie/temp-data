## Question

Left atrium enlargement

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about left atrial enlargement, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining left atrial enlargement and the best measurement method. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and etiologies, including hemodynamic, structural, and lifestyle drivers. Next, I will review prognostic implications across AF, stroke, HF, and mortality. After that, I need to check how to distinguish physiologic from pathologic remodeling, especially in athletes. Then, I will examine functional assessment beyond size. Next, I should review evidence for reverse remodeling and therapeutic strategies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical clinical approach and highlight uncertainties and future directions, ensuring each step is supported by appropriate references and that I double-check any assumptions I make along the way.

> Let me first confirm the definition and measurement standards. Left atrial enlargement is best quantified by indexed left atrial volume (LAVI) using 2D or 3D echocardiography, with a normal upper limit of 34 mL/m² in adults; M-mode diameter is less reliable and should be avoided when possible, and I need to ensure indexing to body surface area to avoid sex- and size-related bias [^1161623A]. Wait, let me verify the prognostic superiority of volume over diameter; yes, indexed LA volume outperforms area or diameter for predicting cardiovascular events, reinforcing the preference for LAVI in routine practice [^115uDwb4].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology. In the absence of mitral valve disease or chronic AF, LA enlargement most commonly reflects chronic elevation of left atrial pressure from LV diastolic dysfunction, with LA remodeling serving as a morphophysiologic expression of diastolic burden over time; this relationship is bidirectional, as AF itself can further worsen remodeling via electrical and structural changes, creating a vicious cycle [^114oYTvK] [^112r2P7D]. Hold on, I should verify that LA enlargement is not merely a passive marker; indeed, LA disease with fibrosis and dysfunction can actively contribute to HF progression and AF substrate, underscoring its pathobiologic importance beyond being a bystander [^115TQkeG].

> Next, I should review etiologies systematically. Hemodynamic drivers include LV diastolic dysfunction, mitral valve disease, hypertension, and high-output states; structural contributors include obesity, sleep apnea, and atrial myopathy with fibrosis; lifestyle factors include long-term endurance training and alcohol exposure, which can enlarge the LA via different mechanisms and with different clinical implications [^114h63Mo] [^113ybEkM] [^1125818U]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought age alone independently enlarges the LA; let me reconsider — data suggest age per se is not an independent driver when adjusted for blood pressure and body size, so cumulative exposure to elevated BP and metabolic load better explains age-related LA enlargement patterns [^113RbPoB] [^116wsxwe].

> I need to check prognostic implications carefully. LA enlargement robustly predicts incident AF, ischemic stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and mortality across diverse populations; in treated hypertensive elders, LAE independently increases stroke risk, and in surgical cohorts, larger indexed LA size tracks higher cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, highlighting its value for risk stratification [^116kQjnD] [^117VC1DV] [^1125fn5a]. Hold on, I should verify stroke risk beyond AF; yes, moderate-to-severe LAE predicts recurrent cardioembolic or cryptogenic stroke even after adjusting for AF, supporting the concept of atrial cardiomyopathy as a thromboembolic substrate [^114gARrt].

> But wait, what if the LA is large in an athlete — does that carry the same risk? I should double-check the distinction between physiologic and pathologic remodeling. In competitive athletes, LA enlargement is relatively common and largely reflects increased preload and chamber compliance with preserved or enhanced atrial function; arrhythmia prevalence remains low, and upper limits around 45 mm in women and 50 mm in men help flag cases that warrant closer scrutiny for pathology or AF risk [^1114r1EJ] [^116NvVEU]. Let me verify functional preservation in athletes; multiple studies show that atrial strain indices remain normal or improved despite larger size, supporting a benign adaptive phenotype when function is intact [^116NvVEU].

> Next, I should review functional assessment beyond size. LA reservoir, conduit, and booster-pump functions can be quantified with speckle-tracking strain and rhythm-independent indices like the LA function index; impaired strain, particularly reduced reservoir strain, predicts incident AF and adverse outcomes even when LA volume is normal, emphasizing that dysfunction may precede or accompany enlargement and is not captured by size alone [^116MDoG2] [^114TT5be]. Hold on, I should verify that strain adds incremental value; yes, LA strain refines AF risk prediction and correlates with fibrosis burden, making it a sensitive marker of atrial myopathy [^114TT5be].

> I will now examine the evidence for reverse remodeling. Timely treatment of upstream drivers — blood pressure control, weight loss, sleep apnea therapy, alcohol reduction, and rhythm control with catheter ablation — can reduce LA volume and improve strain, with observational and interventional data showing LA shrinkage after sinus rhythm restoration and after risk-factor modification in selected cohorts [^112r2P7D] [^112zPL7E]. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence; while randomized data are limited, convergent observational and prospective cohort signals support the concept that LA remodeling is modifiable, especially when interventions are applied earlier in the disease continuum [^115HiX2r].

> Let me consider therapeutic implications pragmatically. For hypertension, RAAS blockade and strict BP control may attenuate LA remodeling and AF burden; for obesity, intentional weight loss reduces AF risk and may modestly reduce LA size; for alcohol, dose-dependent LA enlargement and AF risk are observed, and reduction or abstinence is reasonable; for persistent AF, rhythm-control strategies including ablation can promote reverse remodeling, though the degree of benefit depends on baseline LA size and fibrosis burden [^116TUe2v] [^1125818U] [^112r2P7D]. I should confirm that ablation outcomes vary by LA size; indeed, larger LA predicts higher recurrence, yet some subanalyses suggest tailored substrate modification may still benefit selected patients with advanced remodeling [^116wwktj].

> Next, I should review a practical clinical approach. First, confirm LAE with indexed LA volume rather than diameter; second, search for and treat upstream causes such as hypertension, obesity, sleep apnea, mitral valve disease, and high-output states; third, assess LA function with strain and consider rhythm status; fourth, risk stratify for AF and stroke using LAVI and strain alongside clinical scores; fifth, initiate targeted therapy and reassess LAVI and strain at 6–12 months to document reverse remodeling and adjust management accordingly [^1161623A] [^112BvaNp]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines endorse LA size as a diastolic marker; yes, in the absence of chronic AF or mitral disease, LA enlargement supports chronic elevation of LV filling pressures and informs HFpEF evaluation [^112BvaNp].

> I need to ensure I address uncertainties and future directions. Standardization of LA strain acquisition and cutoffs, prospective trials testing LA reverse remodeling as a surrogate endpoint, and better integration of multimodality imaging to quantify fibrosis and mechanics are needed; emerging data on LA shape, such as roof enlargement in HFpEF, may yield earlier phenotypic markers of disease and guide therapy selection [^11799rLC] [^112gxC3b]. But wait, what if LA size fails to improve despite optimal therapy? That may signal advanced atrial myopathy with irreversible fibrosis, prompting reconsideration of rhythm-control intensity and anticoagulation thresholds even in the absence of documented AF, though evidence remains evolving [^112r2P7D].

> In summary, I should confirm that LA enlargement is a powerful, integrative biomarker of cumulative cardiovascular stress, with LA volume indexed to body surface area as the preferred metric; it reflects diastolic burden, predicts AF, stroke, HF, and mortality, and can guide upstream therapy and rhythm-control decisions, while functional indices like strain refine risk and detect subclinical atrial myopathy; importantly, LA remodeling is modifiable in many patients, and documenting reverse remodeling can serve as a tangible therapeutic target in longitudinal care [^1161623A] [^115uDwb4] [^112r2P7D].

Left atrial enlargement (LAE) is defined as an **indexed LA volume > 34 mL/m²** [^1161623A] by echocardiography and reflects chronic pressure/volume overload or atrial myopathy [^114oYTvK]. It is a **strong, independent predictor** of atrial fibrillation, stroke, heart failure, and mortality [^1125fn5a] [^117CZx8z] [^114gARrt]. Common causes include hypertension, mitral valve disease, heart failure, obesity, and atrial fibrillation; less frequent causes include congenital heart disease, high-output states, and athletic remodeling [^113mHAXY] [^112JqVFg] [^1114r1EJ]. Management focuses on treating underlying causes, risk factor modification, and anticoagulation when indicated; LAE can regress with therapy, but advanced remodeling may be irreversible [^112r2P7D] [^115TQkeG].

---

## Definition and measurement

- **Definition**: LAE is best defined as an indexed LA volume (LAVI) > 34 mL/m² by 2D or 3D echocardiography [^1161623A].
- **Measurement**: LA volume is preferred over diameter because it better reflects true size and is more predictive of outcomes [^115uDwb4] [^1161623A].
- **Normal ranges**: Normal LAVI is ≤ 34 mL/m²; mild 35–41, moderate 42–48, and severe > 48 mL/m² [^1161623A].

---

## Etiology and pathophysiology

LAE arises from **chronic pressure or volume overload** and/or **atrial myopathy** [^114oYTvK]:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Hemodynamic overload | - Hypertension <br/> - Mitral stenosis/regurgitation <br/> - Aortic stenosis <br/> - Heart failure (HFrEF/HFpEF) [^1161623A] [^114h63Mo] [^111Byhbs] [^1174NmmL] |
| Atrial myopathy | - Atrial fibrillation <br/> - Inflammation/fibrosis <br/> - Genetic predisposition [^112yTRMb] [^115ChE6v] |
| Lifestyle factors | - Obesity <br/> - Alcohol use <br/> - Endurance athletics [^113ybEkM] [^1125818U] [^1114r1EJ] |
| Other causes | - Congenital heart disease <br/> - High-output states <br/> - Chronic kidney disease [^112JqVFg] [^114h63Mo] [^116jCTgC] |

---

Mechanistically, **chronic elevation of left atrial pressure** leads to myocyte stretch, fibrosis, and chamber dilation; atrial fibrillation accelerates remodeling via electrical and structural changes [^114oYTvK] [^112r2P7D].

---

## Clinical significance and prognosis

LAE is a **robust marker of adverse outcomes**:

- **Atrial fibrillation**: Strong predictor of incident and recurrent AF [^1134UyoS] [^115ChE6v].
- **Stroke**: Independent predictor of ischemic stroke, including in patients without AF [^117CZx8z] [^114gARrt].
- **Heart failure**: Linked to HF development and progression, especially HFpEF [^112BvaNp] [^112gxC3b].
- **Mortality**: Associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality [^1125fn5a] [^117VC1DV].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Echocardiography**: First-line for LA size/function; assess LAVI, mitral valve, LV function, and diastolic parameters [^116MDoG2] [^115vt7rN].
- **Electrocardiography**: P-wave duration ≥ 120 ms or negative P-terminal force in V1 suggests LAE but has limited sensitivity [^113eaGH2].
- **Advanced imaging**: CMR/CT for detailed anatomy, fibrosis, or thrombus when echo is limited [^112JqVFg].

---

## Management strategies

Management centers on **treating underlying causes** and modifying risk factors:

- **Blood pressure control**: Target < 130/80 mmHg; RAAS inhibition may reduce LA size [^112r2P7D].
- **Rhythm control**: AF ablation or cardioversion can promote reverse remodeling [^112r2P7D] [^112zPL7E].
- **Weight loss**: Reduces LA size and AF risk [^113Scgqc].
- **Alcohol reduction**: Lowers AF risk and may reverse LAE [^113Scgqc].
- **Anticoagulation**: Indicated for AF or high thromboembolic risk per CHA2DS2-VASc [^notfound].

---

## Reversibility of left atrial enlargement

LAE can regress with treatment of the underlying cause — achieving rhythm control, controlling blood pressure, losing weight, and reducing alcohol intake all promote reverse remodeling — but **advanced fibrosis may limit reversibility** [^112r2P7D] [^1157fA31].

---

## Special considerations

Athletes may have **physiologic LAE** with preserved function; distinguishing this from pathologic remodeling requires integrated assessment of size, function, and clinical context [^1114r1EJ] [^116NvVEU]. In obesity, LA enlargement often parallels LV remodeling; disproportionate LA enlargement signals pathologic remodeling and higher risk [^113ybEkM]. In atrial fibrillation, LAE both results from and promotes AF, forming a vicious cycle that worsens remodeling over time [^112r2P7D].

---

Left atrial enlargement is a **key marker of cardiovascular risk** reflecting chronic pressure/volume overload or atrial myopathy. It predicts AF, stroke, HF, and mortality, and management should target underlying causes and risk factors; with treatment, LAE can regress, though advanced fibrosis may be irreversible.

### Left atrial size: physiologic determinants and clinical applications [^113RbPoB]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Left atrial (LA) enlargement has been proposed as a barometer of diastolic burden and a predictor of common cardiovascular outcomes such as atrial fibrillation, stroke, congestive heart failure, and cardiovascular death. It has been shown that advancing age alone does not independently contribute to LA enlargement, and the impact of gender on LA volume can largely be accounted for by the differences in body surface area between men and women. Therefore, enlargement of the left atrium reflects remodeling associated with pathophysiologic processes. In this review, we discuss the normal size and phasic function of the left atrium. Further, we outline the clinically important aspects and pitfalls of evaluating LA size, and the methods for assessing LA function using echocardiography. Finally, we review the determinants of LA size and remodeling, and we describe the evidence regarding the prognostic value of LA size. The use of LA volume for risk stratification is an evolving science. More data are required with respect to the natural history of LA remodeling in disease, the degree of LA modifiability with therapy, and whether regression of LA size translates into improved cardiovascular outcomes.

Definition of left atrial reverse remodelling

Atrial disease, as stated in the recent European Society of Cardiology (ESC) HF guidelines, can be defined as a complex of subclinical structural, electrophysiological, and functional changes that affect the atria with the potential to produce clinical consequences(Graphical Abstract). Signs and symptoms may be those of HF and/or of atrial arrhythmias and be due to both a failing LV and a dysfunctional LA, proving the active role of atrial disease in HF pathophysiology, and in other pathophysiological processes. Impaired atrial contractile reserve and LA enlargement independently predict mortality and CV morbidity, as well as AF onset or recurrence and severity of functional impairment in HF patients.,

The temporal process occurring after the removal of external stressors, leading to a reduction in LA volume and/or a restoration of specific functional parametersis called reverse remodelling.

Only recently the attention shifted to quantifying and evaluating LA reverse remodelling as a potential biomarker that responds to specific therapeutic interventions, potentially providing prognostic information. One critical aspect is that the response to therapeutic interventions is potentially different in the acute or chronic settings or in the early or late stage of atrial failure. In the early stage, the LA is less abnormal and potentially more capable of responding to the changes in myocardial structure and function. When stressors act for a longer time, LA remodelling progresses and reversal might be less likely (Figure 1). Reversibility and, ultimately, the clinical significance of LA reverse remodelling in the late stages of atrial failure, have to be proven, yet. Some studies have indicated that LA dysfunction may precede changes in LA volume in different clinical settings, and in normal subjects. Thus, changes in LA function may be more sensitive than changes in LA volume to detect abnormal myocardial function and the effects of therapeutic interventions. However, this has not been proven, yet.

Figure 1
Progression of left atrial remodelling. The progression of left atrial remodelling goes through several stages, along with progressive worse cardiovascular outcomes. When causative stressors are not removed (by preventive measures or treatments), worsening atrial failure inexorably reaches an irreversible stage. On contrast, acting in the earlier phases may arrest and also reverse the pathophysiologic process.

### Left atrial reverse remodeling: mechanisms, evaluation, and clinical significance [^1157fA31]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

The left atrium is considered a biomarker for adverse cardiovascular outcomes, particularly in patients with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and atrial fibrillation in whom left atrial (LA) enlargement is of prognostic importance. LA enlargement with a consequent decrease in LA function represents maladaptive structural and functional "remodeling" that in turn promotes electrical remodeling and a milieu conducive for incident atrial fibrillation. Medical and nonmedical interventions may arrest this pathophysiologic process to the extent that subsequent reverse remodeling results in a reduction in LA size and improvement in LA function. This review examines cellular and basic mechanisms involved in LA remodeling, evaluates the noninvasive techniques that can assess these changes, and examines potential mechanisms that may initiate reverse remodeling.

### Deep learning of left atrial structure and function provides link to atrial fibrillation risk [^115ChE6v]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Increased left atrial volume and decreased left atrial function have long been associated with atrial fibrillation. The availability of large-scale cardiac magnetic resonance imaging data paired with genetic data provides a unique opportunity to assess the genetic contributions to left atrial structure and function, and understand their relationship with risk for atrial fibrillation. Here, we use deep learning and surface reconstruction models to measure left atrial minimum volume, maximum volume, stroke volume, and emptying fraction in 40,558 UK Biobank participants. In a genome-wide association study of 35,049 participants without pre-existing cardiovascular disease, we identify 20 common genetic loci associated with left atrial structure and function. We find that polygenic contributions to increased left atrial volume are associated with atrial fibrillation and its downstream consequences, including stroke. Through Mendelian randomization, we find evidence supporting a causal role for left atrial enlargement and dysfunction on atrial fibrillation risk.

Introduction

The left atrium (LA) is a thin‐walled dynamic chamber that plays an important role in global cardiac performance, contributing to left ventricle (LV) filling and cardiac output and maintaining a dynamic interaction with the LV. In response to varying stressors (i.e. electrical, mechanical and metabolic), the LA can undergo a remodelling process resulting in its persistent dilatation with functional impairment.LA enlargement and dysfunction are well‐established markers of diastolicand systolic dysfunction, as well as predictors of cardiovascular (CV) outcomes, including atrial fibrillation (AF), stroke, heart failure (HF), and subsequent mortality. This relationship is highly related to LV function and has been shown across all the ejection fraction, even in advanced HF. However, recent data suggest a possible independent contribution of LA dysfunction in HF.

In the past decades, the concept of LA remodelling has evolved, and the contribution of the LA to the pathophysiology of HF has grown in appreciation. Indeed, changes in LA structure and function may be either a marker of HF severity or a mechanism actively contributing to the progression of cardiac dysfunction. One manifestation of LA disease, AF, contributes substantially to morbidity in patients with HF. Recent data suggest that timely therapeutic intervention may attenuate the process of deleterious LA remodelling and potentially promote reverse LA remodelling with a consequent improvement in clinical symptoms and outcomes. In contrast, age and endurance exercise are related to LA enlargement even in absence of LA disease.

Prevention of LA dysfunction and treatment of LA disease may therefore be of critical importance. The relationship between changes in LV structure and function and subsequent CV outcome is well established. We propose here a similar conceptual approach to the LA reflecting dynamic changes in relation to HF progression. The aim of this review is to summarize the concepts and the pathophysiologic mechanisms behind the potential beneficial effects of directed medical therapy on LA reverse remodelling and its clinical implications across all HF stages.

### Left atrial disease and left atrial reverse remodelling across different stages of heart failure development and progression: a new target for prevention and treatment [^11799rLC]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

The left atrium is a dynamic chamber with peculiar characteristics. Stressors and disease mechanisms may deeply modify its structure and function, leading to left atrial remodelling and disease. Left atrial disease is a predictor of poor outcomes. It may be a consequence of left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction and neurohormonal and inflammatory activation and/or actively contribute to the progression and clinical course of heart failure through multiple mechanisms such as left ventricular filling and development of atrial fibrillation and subsequent embolic events. There is growing evidence that therapy may improve left atrial function and reverse left atrial remodelling. Whether this translates into changes in patient's prognosis is still unknown. In this review we report current data about changes in left atrial size and function across different stages of development and progression of heart failure. At each stage, drug therapies, lifestyle interventions and procedures have been associated with improvement in left atrial structure and function, namely a reduction in left atrial volume and/or an improvement in left atrial strain function, a process that can be defined as left atrial reverse remodelling and, in some cases, this has been associated with improvement in clinical outcomes. Further evidence is still needed mainly with respect of the possible role of left atrial reverse remodelling as an independent mechanism affecting the patient's clinical course and as regards better standardization of clinically meaningful changes in left atrial measurements. Summarizing current evidence, this review may be the basis for further studies.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^114oYTvK]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left atrial size and clinical significance — The left atrium delivers 15% to 30% of the entire LV filling, functions as a reservoir that collects pulmonary venous return during ventricular systole, and as a conduit for stored blood to the left ventricle during early ventricular diastole. An enlarged left atrium is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, and in the absence of mitral valve disease, an increase in LA size most commonly reflects increased wall tension as a result of increased LA pressure as well as impairment in LA function secondary to an atrial myopathy. A clear relationship exists between an enlarged left atrium and the incidence of atrial fibrillation and stroke, risk for overall mortality after myocardial infarction, risk for death and hospitalization in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and major cardiac events or death in patients with diabetes mellitus. LA enlargement is a marker of both the severity and chronicity of diastolic dysfunction and magnitude of LA pressure elevation.

### Impact of echocardiographic left ventricular geometry on clinical prognosis [^113bNtut]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Abnormal left ventricular (LV) geometry, including LV hypertrophy (LVH), is associated with increased risk of major cardiovascular (CV) events and all-cause mortality and may be an independent predictor of morbid CV events. Patients with LVH have increased risk of congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, sudden cardiac death and stroke. We review the risk factors for LVH and its consequences, as well as the risk imposed by concentric remodeling (CR). We also examine evidence supporting the benefits of LVH regression, as well as evidence regarding the risk of CR progressing to LVH, as opposed to normalization of CR. We also briefly review the association of abnormal LV geometry with left atrial enlargement and the combined effects of these structural cardiac abnormalities.

### The impact of demographic, anthropometric and athletic characteristics on left atrial size in athletes [^115A6Tf9]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

It has been well established that chronic exercise training results in specific cardiac adaptations, collectively known as the "athlete's heart". 1 These cardiac adaptations include electrical, structural and functional alterations that are generally considered benign. 2, 3, 4 With regard to structural adaptations, there is evidence of cardiac chamber enlargement, increased left ventricular (LV) wall thickness, and prominent LV trabeculations. 3, 4 Notably, increased cavity size appears to involve both the left and right heart and it has been shown to affect not only the ventricles, but the atria as well. 3, 4

Growing concerns have arisen regarding the left atrial (LA) enlargement encountered in athletes, in the light of the potential adverse consequences attributed to increased LA size, including predisposition to atrial arrhythmias and especially atrial fibrillation. 5, 6 Although LA enlargement in athletes can be reasonably considered benign in the absence of increased LV filling pressures and mitral valve dysfunction, the excessive LA enlargement in some athletes may challenge the notion of the benign nature of this process. In this respect, the characteristics of the athlete predisposing to LA enlargement are important to be elucidated, since this information will enable the clinician to judge whether the magnitude of LA enlargement in an athlete can be normally expected on the basis of the athlete's characteristics. Furthermore, the importance of the study of characteristics of the athletes with LA enlargement relies on the identification of possible modifiable predisposing characteristics leading to LA enlargement, such as training volume, that, if changed, could decrease the severity of LA enlargement in the case of athletes with atrial arrhythmias. Therefore, this review article discusses the demographic, anthropometric, and athletic characteristics associated with LA enlargement and attempts to elucidate the relative importance of them in determining LA size in athletes. No previous study has addressed these issues.

### Left atrium and cardiovascular risk: does functionality matter more than size? [^111AveBV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The left atrium (LA) is often regarded as a biomarker of cardiovascular risk. It serves several important functions: it modulates left ventricular filling and cardiovascular performance by functioning as a reservoir for pulmonary venous return during ventricular systole; it is a conduit for pulmonary venous return during early ventricular diastole; and it functions as a booster pump that augments ventricular filling during late ventricular diastole. 1 It is highly dynamic and demonstrates structural, functional, and electrical remodeling in a time‐dependent manner in response to various pathophysiological insults. The hallmark of structural remodeling is atrial dilatation and is frequently accompanied by increased interstitial fibrosis with cardiac structural alterations. 2 Functional impairment may occur with or without alteration in LA size. Remodeling that occurs in the initial phase is often reversible, 3 in contrast to remodeling that occurs with ongoing "stressors" over longer duration. 4 These maladaptive changes have a strong association with a wide array of conditions, including heart failure, 4 hypertension, 5 myocardial ischemia, 6 obesity, 7 and obstructive sleep apnea. 8 In tandem with structural change, electrophysiologic abnormalities develop, including global and regional conduction slowing and changes in refractoriness predisposing to onset of atrial arrhythmias and ultimately atrial fibrillation (AF).

### Left atrial size and function: role in prognosis [^113HPNd9]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The author examines the ability of left atrial size and function to predict cardiovascular outcomes. Data are sufficient to recommend evaluation of left atrial volume in certain populations, and although analysis of atrial reservoir, conduit, and booster pump function trails in that regard, the gap is rapidly closing. In this state-of-the-art paper, the author reviews the methods used to assess left atrial size and function and discusses their role in predicting cardiovascular events in general and referral populations and in patients with atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, ischemic heart disease, and valvular heart disease.

### WITHDRAWN: left atrial function and arterial hypertension [^112aEQ1g]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Left atrial enlargement is frequently observed in many cardiac diseases. One of the main determinants of left atrial size is ventricular diastolic function. It has recently been suggested that left atrial volume might be the morphophysiologic expression of long-term modifications induced by diastolic function. Furthermore, left ventricular remodelling, such as it happens in hypertensive patients, is another important determinant of atrial volume. All the volumetric modifications of the left atrium, during cardiac cycle, are involved in hypertensive damage. Therefore, left atrial function impairment represents the result of morphological and haemodynamic alterations observed in hypertension. Actually, many techniques, invasive and non-invasive, are available with the purpose to investigate the real atrial dimensions and provide a suitable assessment of atrial function. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the degree of left atrial enlargement is associated with adverse prognosis in different clinical setting. The predictive value of left atrial volume seems to be independent of left ventricular systolic and diastolic function, but the use of left atrial volume for risk stratification is yet an evolving science: more data are required with respect to the natural history of left atrial remodelling in disease, the degree of left atrial modifiability with therapy and whether regression of left atrial size translates into improved cardiovascular outcome.

### Characterization, pathogenesis, and clinical implications of inflammation-related atrial myopathy as an important cause of atrial fibrillation [^112yTRMb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Historically, long‐standing atrial fibrillation (AF) has been observed in clinical settings that are characterized by prolonged hemodynamic stress. The most common risk factor for AF in the general population is hypertension, and in these patients, left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy followed by left atrial (LA) enlargement creates the anatomical substrate for AF. Activation of the renin‐angiotensin system contributes to the genesis of AF in these patients; in randomized controlled trials, the treatment of patients with hypertension or LV hypertrophy with drugs that inhibit the renin‐angiotensin system ameliorates the burden of AF. 1 Additionally, mitral or aortic valvular disease or LV systolic dysfunction can also produce sustained increases in LA pressure, producing a fertile substrate for AF. Alleviation of the hemodynamic stresses (eg, with corrective valve surgery) can reduce the prevalence of AF in many patients 2; yet, in others, the deranged LA anatomical substrate for AF is not effectively ameliorated by the procedure.

However, during the past several decades, many patients who have AF do not have evidence of a disorder that causes hemodynamic stresses on the left atrium. These patients have echocardiograms that typically reveal no evidence of meaningful valvular abnormalities or dilatation, hypertrophy or impairment of the systolic function of the left ventricle. In these individuals, cardiac imaging commonly reveals abnormalities of the structure or function of the atria, particularly the left atrium. The left atrium is enlarged, and it often exhibits impaired emptying as well as derangements in its reservoir and conduit functions. 3 Abnormalities of LA structure predict the development of AF independent of a history of hypertension, heart failure, or myocardial infarction. 4 These patients have an atrial myopathy, and its most clinically evident manifestation is AF (Figure 1).

### Identification of clinical drivers of left atrial enlargement through genomics of left atrial size [^113jX1jk]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Greater left atrial size is associated with a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease and mortality, but the full spectrum of diagnoses associated with left atrial enlargement in sex-stratified clinical populations is not well known. Our study sought to identify genetic risk mechanisms affecting left atrial diameter (LAD) in a clinical cohort.

Methods

Using Vanderbilt deidentified electronic health record, we studied 6163 females and 5993 males of European ancestry who had at least 1 LAD measure and available genotyping. A sex-stratified polygenic score was constructed for LAD variation and tested for association against 1680 International Classification of Diseases code-based phenotypes. Two-sample univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization approaches were used to assess etiologic relationships between candidate associations and LAD.

Results

A phenome-wide association study identified 25 International Classification of Diseases code-based diagnoses in females and 11 in males associated with a polygenic score of LAD (false discovery rate q < 0.01), 5 of which were further evaluated by Mendelian randomization (waist circumference [WC], atrial fibrillation, heart failure, systolic blood pressure, and coronary artery disease). Sex-stratified differences in the genetic associations between risk factors and a polygenic score for LAD were observed (WC for females; heart failure, systolic blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and WC for males). By multivariable Mendelian randomization, higher WC remained significantly associated with larger LAD in females, whereas coronary artery disease, WC, and atrial fibrillation remained significantly associated with larger LAD in males.

Conclusions

In a clinical population, we identified, by genomic approaches, potential etiologic risk factors for larger LAD. Further studies are needed to confirm the extent to which these risk factors may be modified to prevent or reverse adverse left atrial remodeling and the extent to which sex modifies these risk factors.

### Left atrial functional impairment as a predictor of atrial fibrillation: insights from cardiac CT [^114TT5be]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Both LA remodeling and dysfunction contribute to AF risk

LA remodeling occurs in response to a chronic pathological stimulus such as hypertension and increased fat mass and is associated with an increased risk of AF events. LA enlargement is often used clinically as a simple measure of LA structural remodeling. However, LA structural remodeling is the result of a complex pathophysiological process that involves alterations in cardiomyocyte, fibroblast, and non-collagen infiltrative compartments of the atrium and is accompanied by functional LA impairment.

The development of AF can contribute to adverse atrial remodeling and dilatation. However, this phenomenon has been demonstrated to occur predominantly in persistent AF. We observed a remarkable similarity in LA size and function between individuals with previous paroxysmal AF episodes and those at risk for future AF. These results suggest that in patients with a low AF burden, AF is a consequence of a dysfunctional LA rather than its cause. In these patients, LA enlargement is secondary to associated processes causing LA pressure and/or volume overload.

There is growing evidence that a large proportion of patients who develop AF (particularly paroxysmal AF) do not have an enlarged LA, suggesting that LA dysfunction per se (without overt LA remodeling) increases the propensity to develop AF. We identified global LA dysfunction in approximately half of subjects with normal LAVI. Furthermore, the increased LA volume explained only ~14% of the variability in LATEF, the remainder determined by other risk factors such as age, LV systolic function, LV mass and valvular heart disease.

We observed a linear association between both LATEF and LA reservoir function with incident AF, indicating a close relationship between LA mechanical properties and the risk of incident AF. Finally, nearly 50% of the effect of LA volume on the risk for AF was mediated via LA dysfunction. Thus, although LA enlargement and LA dysfunction share common risk factors, they do not necessarily develop in parallel, and subclinical LA myopathy is a risk factor for incident AF.

### Alcohol consumption, left atrial diameter, and atrial fibrillation [^1145wJpJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Although alcohol consumption has been associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) in several large epidemiologic studies, 1, 2, 3 the responsible mechanisms remain unknown. Previous electrophysiologic studies have failed to demonstrate an electrical mechanism, 4, 5, 6, 7 suggesting that structural changes in the atrium may be responsible.

Heavy alcohol consumption has long been known to result in ventricular cardiomyopathy. 8 As the smaller atria are known to be more prone to enlargement and fibrosis than the ventricles, 9, 10, 11 it is possible that more modest amounts of alcohol might be associated with evidence of atrial myopathy. However, the impact of cumulative alcohol exposure, especially modest alcohol consumption, during adulthood on left atrial structure remains largely undetermined. Furthermore, although an emerging literature provides evidence that alcohol may increase atrial size, 12 studies conducted to date have not taken into account the possible effects of interim AF. As AF itself may lead to left atrial enlargement, 13, 14 it remains unknown whether the alcohol‐associated atrial enlargement represents a co‐traveler, a subsequent effect of AF, or a key intermediate phenotype along the causal pathway between alcohol exposure and AF.

Using data from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), we sought to determine whether cumulative alcohol exposure is associated with enlargement of the left atrium in a large ambulatory cohort prior to any ascertainment of AF and to explore the hypothesis that an increase in left atrial size mediates the association between alcohol and risk for incident AF.

### Left atrial volumetric / mechanical coupling index is ready for prime time across clinical scenarios [^1132jucC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

The left atrium (LA) is a cardiac cavity whose main role is to contain the pulmonary venous flow return during left ventricular (LV) systole and to empty and conduct further pulmonary venous blood into the LV during its diastole. Most of this function is passive as the x‐descent of LA pressure, driving LA filling from pulmonary veins, is induced by the LA spherization (from an ellipsoid at end‐ventricular‐diastole) forced by the traction of LV myocardium during ventricular systole. The only active part of the atrial cycle is the atrial contraction that follows the P‐wave of the ECG. This limited active component of the LA myocardium, for which experimental elimination shows little impact on cardiac output in the absence of other myocardial alterationssuggested that LA active myocardial function is of low clinical significance. This sentiment was corroborated by the benign nature of lone (isolated) atrial fibrillation, characterized by a complete loss of atrial function. Thus, LA has been often considered a passive bystander of ventricular or valvular pathophysiologic alterations and is rarely included among items of importance in prognostic scores. LA enlargement has even been considered as modulating clinical consequences of LV disease by buffering elevated filling pressure or volume overload. However, attention has been drawn to evaluating LA characteristics and their implications by our ability to measure more physiologically LA remodeling by assessing the LA volume index, which showed its link to the subsequent occurrence of atrial fibrillationand demonstrated in patients with mitral regurgitation in sinus rhythm an independent link to clinical outcomeeven for mild enlargement. Therefore, the status of LA as a nonbystander has been upgraded with LA remodeling measured by LA volume index now widely implemented. Furthermore, the question arises whether LA myocardial function is measurable and whether its alterations have, independently of all clinical and myocardial characteristics, any impact on the status and outcome of patients with cardiac diseases.

### Atrial enlargement in the athlete's heart: assessment of atrial function may help distinguish adaptive from pathologic remodeling [^116NvVEU]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2018). Low credibility.

Intensive training is associated with hemodynamic changes that typically induce an enlargement of cardiac chambers, involving not only the ventricles but also the atria. The hearts of competitive athletes are characterized by increases in left and right atrial dimensions that have been interpreted as a physiologic adaptation to training. Conversely, some authors have hypothesized maladaptive remodeling; furthermore, the extent of left atrial dimensional remodeling may overlap atrial dilation observed in patients with cardiac disease, representing a challenge for clinicians. However, studies investigating left and right atrial function in athletes have demonstrated that atrial size is insufficient to provide mechanistic information about the atrium itself, and an increase in atrial size is not intrinsically an expression of atrial dysfunction. The authors critically analyze training-induced atrial remodeling, taking into account not only the assessment of atrial size but also the evaluation of atrial function, suggesting that the characterization of atrial function plays a fundamental role in the evaluation of athlete's heart, being useful to differentiate physiologic remodeling induced by exercise from pathologic changes occurring in cardiac disorders.

### Natural history of echocardiographic changes in atrial fibrillation: a case-controlled study of longitudinal remodeling [^116Jxgvp]. Heart Rhythm (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) can be a cause and consequence of cardiac remodeling. The natural history of remodeling associated with AF is incompletely described.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to describe the frequency and timing of AF-associated echocardiographic changes.

Methods

Patients within the Duke University Health System with ≥ 2 transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs) performed between 2005 and 2018 were evaluated. Patients with AF and normal baseline TTEs were matched to patients without AF on year of TTE, age, and CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score. Frequency and timing of changes in chamber size, ventricular function, mitral regurgitation, and all-cause mortality were compared over 5 years of follow-up.

Results

The cohort included 3299 patients with AF at baseline and 7613 controls without AF. Normal baseline TTEs were acquired from 730 of patients with AF; 727 of these patients were matched to controls without AF. Patients with AF had higher rates of left atrial enlargement (hazard ratio [HR] 1.53; 95% confidence interval 1.27–1.85; P < .001), left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction (HR 1.80; 95% confidence interval 1.00–3.26; p = 0.045), LV diastolic dysfunction (HR 1.51; 95% confidence interval 1.08–2.10; p = 0.01), and moderate or greater mitral regurgitation (HR 2.09; 95% confidence interval 1.27–3.43; p = 0.003) than did controls. Atrial enlargement, systolic dysfunction, and mitral regurgitation surpassed the rates seen in controls within 6–12 months, whereas differences in diastolic dysfunction emerged at 24 months. There were no differences in ventricular sizes or mortality.

Conclusion

AF is associated with higher rates of left atrial enlargement, LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and mitral regurgitation that typically manifest within 6–24 months of diagnosis. The natural history of cardiac remodeling in patients with AF may inform treatment decisions and facilitate patient-tailored care.

### Left atrial cardiomyopathy: a puzzling disease process short of an easy answer [^114fzazc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

The left atrium (LA) contributes to the development and propagation of atrial fibrillation (AF). Manifestations of LA disease include LA enlargement, diminished strain, fibrosis, and atrial arrhythmias. Observational studies suggest that alcohol consumption contributes to LA dilation, myocardial fibrosis, and the development of AF. Although these findings are consistent across multiple studies, the exact nature of the link between alcohol consumption and atrial disease remains incompletely understood.

The rigorous analyses published by Alam and colleagues in this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA) provide new insights into the subject. The investigators analyzed associations between alcohol consumption and LA size and functional parametersamong participants enrolled in the ongoing randomized controlled PREDIMED‐Plus (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea‐Plus) trial. Participants had rigorous follow‐up with longitudinal echocardiographic studies at 3 and 5 years. In addition, the investigators evaluated behavioral changes, including those related to alcohol intake, over the study duration. Some of their findings demonstrate a dose‐dependent effect of alcohol on the LA. At baseline, heavy drinkers had an increased LA volume index and had evidence of atrial dysfunction manifested by reduced reservoir and contractile strain. Over the follow‐up period, there was no association between baseline alcohol consumption and longitudinal changes in LA volume index and LA strain. However, among those who increased their alcohol intake by at least 1 drink per day, there was an increase in LA volume index by 0.71 mL/m 2 (95% CI, 0.17–1.26). This increase in volume was not accompanied by a decrease in any of the strain measurements. A counterintuitive finding was that a reduction in alcohol intake was not associated with positive LA remodeling or improvements in LA volume index and strain. Although these findings raise the possibility of alcohol inducing irreversible LA remodeling, they would not be concordant with prior studies and clinical experience demonstrating a reduction in AF burden with lower alcohol intake. Of course, it is also conceivable that structural and functional changes do not correspond with electrical remodeling, such as the burden of atrial arrhythmias observed in these individuals. Furthermore, one should be careful not to overinterpret the current findings as there were multiple outcomes evaluated in this study without correction for multiple testing. This could explain some of the discrepant findings, which could in part be attributable to chance.

### Protecting against sedentary lifestyle, left atrial enlargement and atrial fibrillation [^1137VBKA]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Overall, in agreement with the results reported by Heitmann and colleagues, LAE is one important factor associated with the onset of AF. The study conducted by Heitmann and coworkers increases the evidence on how physical activity or exercise intensity can be implicated in LAE, and hence, in preventing or increasing the risk of suffering AF. Until now, it has not been demonstrated that there is a genetic association of exercise with AF but only that it is related to CV adaptations and/or maladaptations in response to long-term and high-intensity training and/or competition. It seems reasonable to monitor cardiac remodelling and be aware of AF symptoms in these individuals. Finally, there is little evidence to date on the adverse CVD complications, including stroke, of AF in highly trained athletes, with or without LAE, that are well-known complications in many typical patients with AF.

### Alcohol consumption, left atrial diameter, and atrial fibrillation [^1125818U]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Alcohol consumption has been associated with atrial fibrillation in several epidemiologic studies, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We sought to test the hypothesis that an atrial myopathy, manifested by echocardiographic left atrial enlargement, explains the association between chronic alcohol use and.

Methods and Results

We evaluated the relationship between cumulative alcohol consumption and risk of incidentin 5220 Offspring and Original Framingham Heart Study participants (mean age 56.3 years, 54% women) with echocardiographic left atrial size measurements. The incidence ofwas 8.4 per 1000 person‐years, with 1088 incidentcases occurring over a median 6.0 years (25th–75th percentiles 4.0–8.7 years) of follow‐up. After multivariable adjustment for potential confounders, every additional 10 g of alcohol per day (just under 1 drink per day) was associated with a 0.16 mm (95%, 0.10–0.21 mm) larger left atrial dimension. Also in multivariable adjusted analysis, every 10 g per day of alcohol consumed was associated with a 5% higher risk of developing new‐onset(hazard ratio, 1.05; 95%, 1.01–1.09). An estimated 24% (95%, 8–75) of the association between alcohol andrisk was explained by left atrial enlargement.

Conclusions

Our study of a large, community‐based sample identified alcohol consumption as a predictor of left atrial enlargement and subsequent incident. Left atrial enlargement may be an intermediate phenotype along the causal pathway linking long‐term alcohol consumption to.

### Efficacy of low-voltage-area ablation is enhanced in patients with advanced left atrial enlargement: a subanalysis of the SUPPRESS-AF trial [^114fVRBL]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Impact of Left Atrial Enlargement on the Efficacy of LVA-ABL

We offer the following speculation on why LVA-ABL was effective only in patients with left atrial enlargement. First, left atrial size is a potentially good patient selection indicator for LVA-ABL, because the arrhythmic substrate is likely more prevalent in the atria outside the pulmonary veins in patients with advanced atrial enlargement. This concept is supported by a previous report, which demonstrated an association between left atrial enlargement and refractoriness to PVI in the presence of LVAs.

Second, the difference in underlying pathology may impact the efficacy of LVA-ABL. In patients with advanced left atrial enlargement, suppression of AF by ablation leads to an improvement in conditions such as heart failure and AF persistence. Reduction of left atrial pressure and volume overload would, therefore, prevent further remodeling development, possibly contributing to a long-term AF suppression effect of LVA-ABL. On the other hand, atrial remodeling likely continues even after LVA-ABL in patients with no or mild left atrial enlargement, characterized by elderly and low body mass index. Further remodeling advancement could offset the effect of AF suppression by ablation.

Third, the AF-suppressing effect of LVA-ABL may have been counteracted by ATs after LVA-ABL in patients with no or mildly enlarged left atrium. This notion is based on our present finding that ablation targeting ATs at the initial ablation and ATs during the 1-year follow-up period in the LVA-ABL group were more frequently observed in patients with an LAD ≤ 44 mm than in those with an LAD > 44 mm. One possible explanation is that there is relatively less residual excitable myocardium after LVA-ABL in patients with no or mild left atrial enlargement, making ATs more likely to develop.

### Does left atrial volume affect exercise capacity of heart transplant recipients? [^115qjGCK]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

The dilatation of LAV might be also in part related to the surgical scar of the left atrial anastomosis. The surgical scar between the native and the donor atrium may impede correct left atrial pump function and therefore, the left atrium may subsequently dilate to increase the reservoir capacity as a compensatory mechanism, which in turn theoretically would maintain left atrial output in the presence of impaired atrial pump function.

Following HT, an enlarged left atrium is considered to be a typical and clinically insignificant finding during any post-transplant echocardiography. This fact often leads to an under-appreciation of how left atrial enlargement may play a role in transplanted heart function. Thus, increases in left atrium size in HT patients, as well as in other cardiac disease patients, may be an important surrogate for significant loss of atrial function or worsening of left ventricular diastolic function, and furthermore, such functional deterioration may only appear during exercise. For example, as a possible atrial structure-function mechanism, consider that in an enlarged left atrium with preserved wall compliance but without compensatory augmentation of active atrial contraction - as would be the case after HT - with exercise there may be pooling of intra-atrial venous return; such pooling could lead to a significant restriction of left ventricular preload during the period of increased cardiac demand, and therefore in turn limit the patient's exercise capacity. Thus, improved functional capacity in HT recipients with total orthotopic HT using both bicaval and pulmonary vein anastomosis, as compared to traditional orthotopic HT technique, may be in part related to reduction of left atrial size. This hypothesized mechanism might be investigated by assessing left atrial volume and function and exercise capacity in our HT population using exercise echocardiography. Our study for the first time suggests that both indicators - larger absolute LAV and an increase in LAV following HT - may be early warning signs of declining exercise capacity in this population.

### Associations between physical activity, left atrial size and incident atrial fibrillation: the troms ø study 1994–2016 [^113ZdFjP]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinical arrhythmia worldwide, associated with considerably morbidity, such as stroke and heart failure. In 2016, the global prevalence of AF was 43.6 million, and lifetime risk for developing AF in Europeans over 55 years is approximately one in three. Furthermore, the risk of AF increases with ageing, and due to increased longevity in the general population, a twofold increase in AF is expected during the next decades. Thus, more knowledge on modifiable risk factors for prevention of AF is needed.

Physical activity (PA) is recommended for health promotion and disease prevention, and it is well documented that PA is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease including AFand all-cause mortality. Paradoxically, studies have reported that high amounts of vigorous exercise may attenuate the benefits of moderate PA, or even increase the risk of AF. Studies have demonstrated that the risk of AF increases with high levels of lifelong exercise, or participation in endurance sports, and that elite athletes more frequently experience AF than non-athletes.

Several studies have reported that left atrial (LA) enlargement is an independent risk factor for AF in the general population, and pathological conditions that increase LA size (eg, hypertension, valvular heart disease and heart failure) further increase the risk of AF. In addition to increased risk of AF, LA enlargement is a risk factor for stroke and all-cause mortalityin the general population. Additionally, LA size increases with exercise, and studies have observed that LA size is larger in both athletesand in active adult and elderly individuals. Some elite athletes even have LA enlargement overlapping LA size seen in cardiac pathology. The mechanisms underlying the association between exercise and AF are not established, but it is suggested that the increased risk of AF with extensive endurance exercise may be linked to LA enlargement.

However, despite increased risk of AF with both LA enlargement and with vigorous exercise, convincing data linking the combination of exercise and LA size to AF are lacking and are largely speculative. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that LA function is preserved, or even improved in athletes with LA enlargement. Also, LA enlargement has been reported in endurance athletes, without correlation with electrophysiologic remodelling. Thus, it is of importance to elucidate if LA enlargement is a benign physiological adaption of PA and exercise, or part of a pathophysiological mechanism increasing the risk of AF.

### EHRA / HRS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus on atrial cardiomyopathies: definition, characterization, and clinical implication [^115pdbGQ]. Europace (2016). Medium credibility.

Lone atrial fibrillation (LAF) — epidemiology, risk, and clinical course is described as occurring more often in males than females with a ratio of 3 to 4:1, and true cases can be diagnosed even in subjects older than 60 years. It is unclear whether left atrial (LA) enlargement should exclude LAF, and LA enlargement might even be a consequence of the arrhythmia. LAF is at the lower end of thromboembolic risk with only a 1–2% cumulative 15-year risk of stroke. Clinical course relates to LA size: patients maintaining normal LA size over long-term follow-up show a relatively benign course, whereas those with LA enlargement may experience adverse events like stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. The majority of LAF patients first present with paroxysmal episodes and show low progression rates into permanent atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation has clear genetic determinants, encompassing common gene variants with low predictive strength and rare gene mutations with much greater penetrance, and histologic studies in lone paroxysmal AF have found chronic inflammatory infiltrates, foci of myocyte necrosis, focal replacement fibrosis, and myocyte cytoplasmic vacuoles consistent with myolysis.

### Prevalence and clinical significance of left atrial remodeling in competitive athletes [^1114r1EJ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

In the present study we assessed the distribution and clinical significance of left atrial (LA) size in the context of athlete's heart and the differential diagnosis from structural heart disease, as well as the proclivity to supraventricular arrhythmias.

Background

The prevalence, clinical significance, and long-term arrhythmic consequences of LA enlargement in competitive athletes are unresolved.

Methods

We assessed LA dimension and the prevalence of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in 1,777 competitive athletes (71% of whom were males), free of structural cardiovascular disease, that were participating in 38 different sports.

Results

The LA dimension was 23 to 50 mm (mean, 37 ± 4 mm) in men and 20 to 46 mm (mean, 32 ± 4 mm) in women and was enlarged (i.e., transverse dimension ≥ 40 mm) in 347 athletes (20%), including 38 (2%) with marked dilation (≥ 45 mm). Of the 1,777 athletes, only 14 (0.8%) had documented, symptomatic episodes of either paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (n = 5; 0.3%) or supraventricular tachycardia (n = 9; 0.5%), which together occurred in a similar proportion in athletes with (0.9%) or without (0.8%; p = NS) LA enlargement. Multivariate regression analysis showed LA enlargement in athletes was largely explained by left ventricular cavity enlargement (R2 = 0.53) and participation in dynamic sports (such as cycling, rowing/canoeing) but minimally by body size.

Conclusions

In a large population of highly trained athletes, enlarged LA dimension ≥ 40 mm was relatively common (20%), with the upper limits of 45 mm in women and 50 mm in men distinguishing physiologic cardiac remodeling ("athlete's heart") from pathologic cardiac conditions. Atrial fibrillation and other supraventricular tachyarrhythmias proved to be uncommon (prevalence < 1%) and similar to that in the general population, despite the frequency of LA enlargement. Left atrial remodeling in competitive athletes may be regarded as a physiologic adaptation to exercise conditioning, largely without adverse clinical consequences.

### Prevalence of echocardiographic left-atrial enlargement in hypertension: a systematic review of recent clinical studies [^115jwtkW]. American Journal of Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Left atrial enlargement (LAE) is a marker of hypertensive heart disease associated with increased cardiovascular risk. We reviewed recent literature about the prevalence of LAE, as assessed by echocardiography, to update our information about the clinical relevance of this cardiac phenotype in human hypertension.

Methods

We performed a search of MEDLINE using the key words "left atrial enlargement", "left atrial dilatation", "left atrial size", "hypertension", "echocardiography", and "atrial fibrillation" to identify relevant papers. We considered full articles published in English from January 1, 2000 to July 1, 2012 reporting studies involving adult individuals.

Results

We analyzed a total of 15 studies, including 10,141 untreated and treated subjects. LAE was defined according to 11 different criteria (4 studies applied two or three criteria), and its prevalence consistently varied among studies, from 16.0–83.0%, with a prevalence in the pooled population of 32%. A gender-based analysis of 9 studies (8,588 patients) showed the prevalence of LAE as being similar in women and men (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.83–1.83; P = 0.30). Data provided by 10 studies (n = 9,354 patients) showed the prevalence of left-ventricular hypertrophy as being significantly higher in patients with LAE (68.2%) than in their counterparts without LAE (41.8%) (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 2.68–3.29; P < 0.01).

Conclusions

Our analysis shows that LAE is present in a relevant fraction of the hypertensive population. Because LAE is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events, the accurate detection of this phenotype may improve the evaluation of risk in hypertensive patients.

### Alcohol consumption, left atrial diameter, and atrial fibrillation [^112uCfSB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

LA structural remodeling, as assessed by LAD, relates to advancing age, male sex, higher body mass index, and greater blood pressure, all key risk factors for AF. Exposure to AF risk factors influences tracking of LAD over the adult life course, LA enlargement preceding AF, and higher LAD conferring an increased risk for incident and recurrent AF. 9, 29, 30, 31, 32 Chronic alcohol consumption has been associated with ventricular dilation and left ventricular dysfunction. 1, 25, 28 Recent studies suggest that atrial remodeling and AF may also result from alcohol exposure. 8 We sought to better understand the associations between chronic alcohol consumption, atrial remodeling, and incident AF. Atrial remodeling is a process characterized by structural and electrophysiological change. Pathological remodeling facilitates the creation of an atrial substrate that is vulnerable to AF initiation, AF persistence, and AF recurrence. 9, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33 LA enlargement, as characterized by echocardiographic LAD, is related to incident AF, heart failure, stroke, and mortality. 9, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33 LA enlargement is sometimes seen in association with valvular or ischemic heart disease, and in these settings can reflect atrial volume or pressure overload, or as a consequence of AF. 13, 14, 32, 34

### Significant incidental cardiac disease on thoracic CT: what the general radiologist needs to know [^112JqVFg]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Left atrial enlargement

Left atrial enlargement can be caused by mitral valvular disease (stenosis and regurgitation), atrial fibrillation, left to right shunts, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), left ventricular failure, dilated cardiomyopathy, and ischemic heart disease. A search should be made for thrombus in the left atrium or its appendage. In addition, evaluation of the mitral valve for calcification or thickening can be made, as well as checking the other chamber sizes and wall thicknesses, and looking for coronary arterial calcification. Left atrial anteroposterior measurements should ideally be made on a three-chamber view (aortic outflow tract, left atrium, and left ventricle) at the end of left ventricular systole. Measurements of the largest anteroposterior left atrial diameter (made at the level of the aortic valve), greater than 4.5 cm on axial non-ECG gated CT, had 94% specificity (53% sensitivity) for left atrial dilatation. Normalized reference range volume measurements for the left atrium and other cardiac chambers have been established using dynamic magnetic resonance imaging by Maceira and colleagues.

Right atrial enlargement

Right atrial enlargement can be caused by pulmonary arterial hypertension, tricuspid valvular disease (stenosis and regurgitation), atrial fibrillation, left to right shunts, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and ischemic heart disease. There are no accepted standardized measurements for right atrial sizes. Normalized reference range volume measurements for the right atrium and other cardiac chambers have been established using dynamic magnetic resonance imaging.

Left ventricular enlargement

Left ventricular enlargement (LVE) can be indicative of many pathological entities, including cardiomyopathies, ischemic heart disease and valvular dysfunction.

Non-ECG gated CT images likely will not be obtained in end-diastole and so the ventricular cavity size may be underestimated. A recent study suggested that left ventricular chamber measurements greater than 5.6 cm (made half way between the apex and the valve, from inner wall to inner wall) on axial non-ECG gated CT had a 100% specificity (78% sensitivity) and negative predictive value of 93% (positive predictive value of 80%). Therefore, dimensional thresholds are best used to provide specific detection (rule in) and to suggest for chamber enlargement, rather than being able to exclude it. Normalized reference range volume measurements for the left ventricle and other cardiac chambers are well established by dynamic magnetic resonance imaging.

### Left atrium and cardiovascular risk: does functionality matter more than size? [^116MDoG2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Atrial size and function can be assessed with echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography, and cardiac magnetic resonance, but because of its safety, relative low cost, and universal availability, echocardiography is the most widely applied first‐line modality. Many of the earlier measures of atrial function were only measurable during sinus rhythm, making comparisons in subjects with AF challenging. These measures include the following: (1) peak "A" wave velocity and velocity time integral of transmitral flow in late diastole; (2) estimation of the fractional contribution of atrial contraction to total mitral inflow; and (3) the use of Doppler tissue imaging as a global measure of atrial function. Recent advances in 2‐ and 3‐dimensional echocardiography, including in tissue Doppler imaging, and speckle tracking for strain analysis 9 have allowed evaluation of atrial function during AF. These varying parameters have distinct strengths and weaknesses and are complementary in differing clinical scenarios. The LA function index (LAFI) uses volumetric measurement of the LA and is a composite rhythm‐independent measure of LA function. It is a ratio that incorporates analogues of cardiac output, atrial reservoir function, and LA size and is calculated as follows: LAFI = (LA emptying fraction×velocity time integral across the left ventricular outflow tract)/largest LA volume measure in ventricular systole indexed to body surface area. 10 Thus, LAFI increases proportionally to LA reservoir function and stroke volume, but it is inversely proportional to LA size.

It has become increasingly recognized that structural and functional remodeling are important factors that determine cardiovascular prognosis and risk stratification. Several studies have demonstrated this association in different population subsets. In a single‐center study 11 that included ambulatory patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (< 40%) who were clinically stable and optimally treated, LAFI was a predictor of long‐term survival. Patients in the lower LAFI quartile had more severe heart failure symptoms, renal function, and left ventricular systolic function. Subgroup analysis by heart rhythm (sinus rhythm versus AF) revealed that this remained consistent in both subgroups. LAFI was also noted to be a predictor of heart failure hospitalization in another population‐based cohort study with stable coronary artery disease and preserved baseline ejection fraction (≥ 50%). 12 Besides functional remodeling, LA enlargement alone estimated by LA volume indexed to body surface area has also been demonstrated to predict adverse cardiovascular events in patients with stable coronary artery disease, 13 valvular heart disease, 14 and dilated cardiomyopathy. 15

### Evaluation of left atrial size and function: relevance for clinical practice [^115vt7rN]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). Medium credibility.

Left atrial (LA) structural and functional evaluation have recently emerged as powerful biomarkers for adverse events in a variety of cardiovascular conditions. Moreover, noninvasive evaluation of LA pressure has gained importance in the characterization of the hemodynamic profile of patients. This review describes the methodology, benefits and pitfalls of measuring LA size and function by echocardiography and provides a brief overview of the prognostic utility of newer echocardiographic metrics of LA geometry and function (i.e., three-dimensional volumes, longitudinal strain, and phasic function parameters).

### A look at the upper heart chamber: the left atrium in chronic kidney disease [^116jCTgC]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Altered left ventricular (LV) mass and function are classical hallmarks of cardiomyopathy in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The left atrium (LA), a heart chamber exquisitely sensitive to volume overload and diastolic function, is an independent predictor of death and adverse cardiovascular (CV) events in high-risk patients such as those with hypertension and/or with heart failure. In this review we focus on the relationship of LA size with LV diastolic function, and the association between LA enlargement and CV and renal outcomes in patients with CKD, including patients with end-stage renal disease. Increased LA size emerges as a powerful predictor of mortality and major adverse CV events in both end-stage and early CKD, and some studies also show a close association between enlarged LA and renal disease progression. Secondary analyses of clinical trials suggest that the LA has the potential to be elected as a surrogate end point in CKD patients but the issue remains to be tested in specifically designed clinical studies.

### Asymptomatic giant left atrium [^111SrBqW]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Giant left atria (GLA) is a condition where the left atrial diameter exceeds 65 mm. It is closely related to rheumatic mitral valve regurgitation or mixed mitral disease with predominant regurgitation and tends not to occur in patients with mitral regurgitation due to other causes. The majority of patients are symptomatic with the most common symptoms being that of shortness of breath, dysphagia, palpitations, chest pain, and thromboembolic events. Massive asymptomatic enlargement of the left atrium is a rare entity. We present such a case.

### Recommendations for the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function by echocardiography: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of Cardiovascular imaging [^114h63Mo]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2016). Medium credibility.

Left atrial (LA) maximum volume index — LA volume reflects the cumulative effects of increased LV filling pressures and is an independent predictor of death, heart failure, atrial fibrillation (AF), and ischemic stroke; it is feasible and reproducible and provides diagnostic and prognostic information on LV diastolic dysfunction and chronicity, with apical four-chamber views aiding visual confirmation of enlargement, but LA dilation can occur from non-diastolic causes (e.g., bradycardia, high-output states, bialtrial heart transplant technique, atrial flutter/fibrillation, significant mitral valve disease, well-trained athletes), and measurement can be limited by image quality, foreshortening, and aortic or interatrial septal aneurysms.

### Alcohol consumption, left atrial diameter, and atrial fibrillation [^112wyzVa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Alcohol consumption has been associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) in several epidemiologic studies, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We sought to test the hypothesis that an atrial myopathy, manifested by echocardiographic left atrial enlargement, explains the association between chronic alcohol use and AF.

Methods and Results

We evaluated the relationship between cumulative alcohol consumption and risk of incident AF in 5220 Offspring and Original Framingham Heart Study participants (mean age 56.3 years, 54% women) with echocardiographic left atrial size measurements. The incidence of AF was 8.4 per 1000 person-years, with 1088 incident AF cases occurring over a median 6.0 years (25th-75th percentiles 4.0–8.7 years) of follow-up. After multivariable adjustment for potential confounders, every additional 10 g of alcohol per day (just under 1 drink per day) was associated with a 0.16 mm (95% CI, 0.10–0.21 mm) larger left atrial dimension. Also in multivariable adjusted analysis, every 10 g per day of alcohol consumed was associated with a 5% higher risk of developing new-onset AF (hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01–1.09). An estimated 24% (95% CI, 8–75) of the association between alcohol and AF risk was explained by left atrial enlargement.

Conclusions

Our study of a large, community-based sample identified alcohol consumption as a predictor of left atrial enlargement and subsequent incident AF. Left atrial enlargement may be an intermediate phenotype along the causal pathway linking long-term alcohol consumption to AF.

### Atrial structure and function and its implications for current and emerging treatments for atrial fibrillation [^114g88UY]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Left atrial (LA) structure and function are intimately related to the clinical phenotypes of atrial fibrillation (AF), and have direct implications for the success or otherwise of various therapeutic strategies. In conjunction with intrinsic structural characteristics of the LA, pathological remodelling to a large extent dictates the clinical course of AF. Remodelling is a product of the physiological and structural plasticity of the LA in disease states (including AF itself), and manifests as electrical, physical and structural changes that promote the substrate necessary for AF maintenance. The degree of remodelling impacts upon the efficacy of pharmacological, non-pharmacological and interventional treatments for AF. Evolving therapies seek to specifically target these processes although presently, several remain in the development phase. Catheter ablation (CA) is now firmly established as a highly effective treatment for AF, although increasing its efficacy in the remodelled LA of more severe AF phenotypes remains an ongoing challenge.

### Efficacy of low-voltage-area ablation is enhanced in patients with advanced left atrial enlargement: a subanalysis of the SUPPRESS-AF trial [^116wwktj]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main findings of this post hoc analysis of the SUPPRESS-AF trial were as follows. (1) In patients with an LAD > 44 mm, the LVA-ABL group demonstrated a higher AF/AT recurrence–free rate than the PVI-alone group. (2) In contrast, no difference in AF/AT recurrence rate was found between the 2 groups in patients with an LAD ≤ 44 mm. (3) The hazard ratio of AF/AT recurrence in the LVA-ABL group to PVI-alone group decreased as the left atrium became larger. (4) Subgroup analysis suggested that the efficacy of LVA-ABL was associated with several clinical characteristics in patients with LAD > 44 mm. In contrast, in patients with an LAD ≤ 44 mm, no consistent efficacy of LVA-ABL was seen, irrespective of clinical characteristics.

Pathophysiological Implication of Left Atrial Enlargement in the Formation of LVA

No or only a slight correlation was found between LVA size and LAD in this study. This finding is consistent with a previous study involving 1118 cases undergoing AF ablation. Of note, patient background in the present study was characterized by the degree of left atrial enlargement as follows: concomitant heart failure, hypertension, and long duration of AF persistence in patients with LAD > 44 mm, and older and lower body mass index in patients with LAD ≤ 44 mm. Similar clinical features dependent on left atrial size have been reported previously, Taken together with the absence of correlation between left atrial size and LVA size and patient background variance by the degree of left atrial enlargement, differences in left atrial size may reflect different pathologies in the formation of fibrosis or other degeneration of the left atrium.

Cases with an enlarged left atrium are most commonly characterized by pressure and volume overload in the left atrium. Atrial stretch is reported to promote multiple factors, including atrial natriuretic peptide, angiotensin II, endothelin 1, transforming growth factor-beta, and inflammatory cytokines, leading to atrial enlargement. This theoretical explanation describes the atrial remodeling and tissue degeneration that accompany chamber enlargement.

On the other hand, patients with no or only mild left atrial enlargement were older and had lower body mass index. These factors result in atrial remodeling without any predominant involvement of an elevation of atrial pressure, and are therefore unlikely to be accompanied by atrial enlargement. In addition, atrial enlargement in these populations may be hindered by the diminished space available for atrial enlargement due to surrounding organs or structures.

### Association between size of left ventricle and long-term cardiovascular events [^112gtnpc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) stands as the leading global contributor to morbidity and mortality. Over the past few decades, numerous risk factors underlying CVD outcomes have been identified and elucidated, significantly advancing our understanding of cardiovascular mechanisms and facilitating the exploration of novel therapeutic approaches. Over the past few decades, a multitude of risk factors underlying CVD outcomes have been elucidated. Among these, left ventricular size emerges as a pivotal prognostic marker in cardiac pathologies. The dilated left ventricle (LV) is universally acknowledged as a harbinger of poor outcomes in numerous cardiac disorders. Conversely, the existence and potential consequences of a smaller LV have been largely neglected, revealing a skewed research emphasis and a significant knowledge gap in this area.

Despite previous studies investigating the relationship between small LV size and cardiovascular risks in populations with atrial fibrillation and cohorts post transcatheter aortic valve replacement, the association between small LV size and cardiovascular risks in the general population remains elusive. Furthermore, these studies predominantly relied on echocardiography to define small LV size, which is known to have limitations in accuracy. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is the gold standard for assessing cardiac structure and function, underscoring the inadequacy of echocardiography in this context. Additionally, the lack of adjustment for body surface area in prior research calls into question the precision of their findings. Currently, there is a paucity of epidemiological data and insights into the CVD risk associated with CMR‐detected small LV size in the general population.

Given these gaps, leveraging the vast UK Biobank cohort, our study aims to (1) determine the prevalence and risk factors of small LV size in the general population; (2) assess the cardiovascular outcomes associated with small LV size in the general population; and (3) explore, through subgroup analyses, whether cardiovascular risk factors modify the relationship between small LV size and cardiovascular prognosis.

### Left atrial volume and geometry in healthy aging: the cardiovascular health study [^111KLyx1]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The left atrium is a validated marker of clinical and subclinical cardiovascular disease. Left atrial enlargement is often seen among older individuals; however, there are few population-based data regarding normal left atrial size among older persons, especially from those who are healthy, and from women. Furthermore, because the left atrium is a 3D structure, the commonly used parasternal long-axis diastolic diameter often underdiagnoses left atrial enlargement.

Methods and Results

We evaluated left atrial size in 230 healthy participants (mean age, 76 ± 5 years) free of prevalent cardiac disease, rhythm abnormality, hypertension, and diabetes selected from the Cardiovascular Health Study, a prospective community-based study of risk factors for cardiovascular disease in 5888 elderly participants. In addition to the standard long-axis measurement, we obtained left atrial superoinferior and lateral diameters and used these dimensions to estimate left atrial volume. These measurements were used to generate reference ranges for determining left atrial enlargement in older men and women, based on the 95% percentiles of the left atrial dimensions in healthy participants, both unadjusted, and after adjustment for age, height, and weight. In healthy elderly subjects, indices of left atrial size do not correlate with age or height but with weight and other measures of body build.

Conclusions

These data provide normative reference values for left atrial size in healthy older women and men. The results should be useful for refining diagnostic criteria for left atrial dilation in the older population and may be relevant for cardiovascular risk stratification.

### Left atrial disease and left atrial reverse remodelling across different stages of heart failure development and progression: a new target for prevention and treatment [^115HiX2r]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Left atrial remodelling and LA disease are markers of CV disease and may also have an impact on clinical outcomes. Counteracting the underlying mechanisms and removing the causative factors may restore LA structure and function. Increasing evidence indicates significant LA reverse remodelling after initiation of medical therapy across all the stages of development and progression of HF. Although a clear definition of LA reverse remodelling is needed, assessing LA response to targeted therapies appears to be a valid parameter to re‐define patients' risk stratification. Prospective clinical trials are required to establish the role of LA reverse remodelling as a marker of therapeutic response in clinical practice and to assess its potential independent role as a mechanism of development and progression of HF.

### Recommendations for the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function by echocardiography and for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction diagnosis: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography [^112BvaNp]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

LV structure and left atrial (LA) volume and function — structural remodeling supports diastolic dysfunction as LA enlargement, in the absence of chronic atrial arrhythmia and mitral valve disease, is a marker of chronic elevation of LAP and should be interpreted only after exclusion of other causes such as anemia, biatrial heart transplant technique, hyperdynamic state, or athletic status; pathologic LV hypertrophy is usually associated with increased LV chamber stiffness; and increased LV mass index and LA enlargement are among the criteria for the diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

### Structure and function of the left atrium and left atrial appendage: AF and stroke implications [^117Rp7bA]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) and stroke are important major health problems that share common risk factors and frequently coexist. Left atrial (LA) remodeling is an important underlying substrate for AF and stroke. LA dilation and dysfunction form a prothrombotic milieu characterized by blood stasis and endothelial dysfunction. In addition, alterations of the atrial cardiomyocytes, increase of noncollagen deposits in the interstitial space and fibrosis, favor the occurrence of re-entry that predisposes to AF. Eventually, AF further impairs LA function and promotes LA remodeling, closing a self-perpetuating vicious circle. Multimodality imaging provides a comprehensive evaluation of several aspects of LA remodeling and offers several parameters to identify patients at risk of AF and stroke. How multimodality imaging can be integrated in clinical management of patients at risk of AF and stroke is the focus of the present review paper.

### Structural and functional remodeling of the left atrium: clinical and therapeutic implications for atrial fibrillation [^116fmyL2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Left atrial (LA) structural and functional remodeling reflects a spectrum of pathophysiological changes that have occurred in response to specific stressors. These changes include alterations at the levels of ionic channels, cellular energy balance, neurohormonal expression, inflammatory response, and physiologic adaptations. There is convincing evidence demonstrating an important pathophysiological association between LA remodeling and atrial fibrillation (AF). Measures that will prevent, attenuate, or halt these processes of LA remodeling may have a major public health impact with respect to the epidemic of AF. In this review, we describe the mechanisms involved in LA remodeling and highlight the existing and potential therapeutic options for its reversal, and implications for AF development.

### Association of left atrial function with frailty: the atherosclerosis risk in communities (ARIC) study [^112irWoZ]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Frailty is a clinical syndrome most often found in older adults that is characterized by reduced functional reserve and increased vulnerability to poor outcomes following stressor events. It is estimated that up to 10% of individuals aged 65 years or older are frail, and the prevalence of frailty increases to nearly 25% in adults aged 85 years and beyond. Presence of frailty is related to increased utilization of healthcare resources. Moreover, people who are frail have nearly 2.5 times greater risk of mortality compared with robust individuals.

Frailty is highly prevalent in people with cardiovascular disease. The estimated prevalence of frailty is 45% in people with heart failure (HF) and is up to 75% in people with atrial fibrillation (AF). Individuals who are frail and have HF and/or AF have remarkably increased risk of hospitalization and mortality, and lower quality of life. Similarly, frailty is associated with global cognition and dementia status; frailty explains nearly 12% of the variation in dementia in addition to known risk factors. It is hypothesized that the coexistence of frailty and cardiovascular diseases may be explained by shared risk factors and common pathophysiological pathways.

Left atrial (LA) myopathy, characterized by abnormalities in function and size of the left atrium, is associated with adverse cardiovascular prognosis. Increased LA size is a well‐established risk factor for AF, HF, and ischemic stroke. Independent of LA size, functional changes in the left atrium are also associated with cardiovascular outcomes. Left atrial enlargement has been associated with frailty in several observational studies. However, the association between LA function and frailty is unclear. In this study, we investigated the association between LA function, measured by LA strain, and the risk of developing frailty in a cohort of community‐dwelling older adults.

### Recommendations for the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function by echocardiography and for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction diagnosis: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography [^115nAbkx]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Mean left atrial pressure (LAP) at rest — estimation guidance notes that echocardiography can estimate mean LAP using several parameters, and during assessment the patient's rhythm, heart rate, and blood pressure should be recorded because they affect LV diastolic function and the Doppler indices used in the algorithm. No single approach can estimate mean LAP in all clinical situations; in clinical studies, LAVi is often inconsistent with other indices of LAP, and the correlation between LAP and LA volumes is not strong with LA volumes failing to track changes in LAP; other causes for LA enlargement include anemia, athletic heart, high cardiac output states, atrial arrhythmias, and mitral valve disease.

### Mechanisms of left atrial enlargement in obesity [^113ybEkM]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Left atrial (LA) enlargement is common in obesity. We sought to determine the influence of ventricular (LV) remodeling on LA size in obesity. We studied 50 otherwise healthy obese subjects (body mass index 37.2 ± 4.6 kg/m 2, 50 ± 6 years) and 58 age and gender-matched nonobese controls (body mass index 26.2 ± 2.9 kg/m 2, 52 ± 5 years). Diastolic function, relative wall thickness (RWT), and LV mass were assessed using echocardiography. LA and LV volume was measured by 3D-echocardiography. Primary outcome was the ratio of LA volume indexed to LV volume in obese and control subjects. Obese subjects had substantially larger LA volumes compared with control subjects (61.0 ± 16.9 vs 38.9 ± 9.2 ml, p < 0.0001). When scaled to body size or lean mass, differences in LA size persisted. However, when indexed to LV end-diastolic volume, LA volumes between control and obese subjects were comparable (obese vs controls: 0.44 ± 0.15 vs 0.42 ± 0.10, p = 0.46). A small subset of obese subjects (26%) had LA volume markedly out of proportion to LV volume (LA/LV volume ratio ≥ 0.5) and displayed concentric LV remodeling with larger RWT and LV mass compared with obese subjects with LA/LV < 0.5 (RWT: 0.46 ± 0.09 vs 0.36 ± 0.06, p < 0.0001; LV mass: 79 ± 18 vs 62 ± 13 g/m 2 p < 0.01). In conclusion, LA enlargement in patients with obesity generally occurs commensurate with LV enlargement and parallels eccentric LV remodeling. LA enlargement out of proportion to LV size is associated with increased RWT and mass. This unique signature may identify obese subjects with pathologic LA remodeling.

### Associations of alcohol consumption with left atrial morphology and function in a population at high cardiovascular risk [^112yicZL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Excessive alcohol consumption has been associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. An enlarged left atrium and impaired left atrial function may lead to atrial fibrillation. The association of alcohol consumption with structural and functional left atrial measures, however, has received limited attention.

Methods and Results

We studied 503 participants from the PREDIMED-Plus (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea) trial, a randomized trial testing intensive weight loss intervention with an energy-reduced Mediterranean diet and physical activity promotion in preventing cardiovascular disease in adults with metabolic syndrome. Participants underwent transthoracic echocardiography at baseline, year 3, and year 5 of the study. Outcomes of interest included volume index and reservoir, conduit, and contractile strains of the left atrium. Alcohol consumption was calculated through food frequency questionnaires and presented as drinks consumed per day. Multiple linear regression and mixed models estimated the association of alcohol consumption with left atrial measurements at baseline and through follow-up. Cross-sectionally, higher alcohol consumption (per 1drink/day increases) was associated with larger left atrial volume (0.65mL/m 2 [95% CI, 0.18–1.11]) and lower left atrial reservoir and contractile strain (-0.44% [95% CI, -0.87 to -0.01]; and -0.44% [95% CI, -0.75 to -0.14]). Baseline alcohol consumption was not associated with changes in left atrial measurements, but increases in alcohol consumption (per 1 drink/day increase) during follow-up were associated with left atrial enlargement (0.71mL/m 2 [95% CI, 0.17–1.26]).

Conclusions

In a population at high cardiovascular risk, increased alcohol consumption was associated with left atrial enlargement and worsening atrial function.

### Secondary stroke prevention following embolic stroke of unknown source in the absence of documented atrial fibrillation: a clinical review [^1113Tv2X]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Atrial Enlargement and Geometry

A susceptibility to atrial arrhythmias has been demonstrated during abnormal myocardial loading that results in atrial stretch and dilatation, playing an important role in the pathogenesis of AF. During AF, uncontrolled ventricular rates can lead to increased hemodynamic overload and consequently cardiac failure, providing an underlying mechanism for atrial dilatation. However, comorbidities such as hypertension, heart failure, or mitral valve disease also contribute to atrial dilatation, increasing the vulnerability of the left atrium to AF. Ex vivo studies in guinea pig hearts demonstrated electrophysiological changes in atrial tissue following increased left atrial volume. A further study in Langendorff‐perfused rabbit hearts showed a graded increase in AF vulnerability that correlated with increasing atrial pressures. Later, in vitro studies of atrial stretch have shown downstream effects of hypertrophy and apoptosis that feed into the structural and electrophysiological changes described above. Atrial dilatation is related to both the severity of the underlying disease as well as the AF burden and may therefore precede AF manifestation in the context of other risk factors.

The relationship between atrial size and stroke risk has been controversial, in large part because of the significant limitations of studies that were conducted in patients with AF or mitral valve disease. A subgroup analysis of the Framingham Study assessed left atrial size and stroke risk in all patients > 50 years of age. After multivariable adjustment, left atrial size was found to be an independent predictor of stroke with every 10‐mm increase in left atrial size, resulting in a relative risk ratio of 2.4 for men (95% CI, 1.6–3.7) and 1.4 for women (95% CI, 0.9–2.1). Further population‐based studies in the Northern Manhattan Stroke Study assessed the role of atrial enlargement as an independent risk factor for recurrent ischemic stroke in a multiethnic population. Moderate to severe left atrial enlargement was demonstrated in patients with a recurrent cardioembolic or cryptogenic stroke with a hazard ratio of 2.83 after multivariable adjustment (95% CI, 1.03–7.81). These findings were attributed to reduced flow velocity in the LAA or left atrial enlargement representing a marker of end‐organ damage from hypertension, which is a known risk factor for recurrent stroke.

### Left atrial volumes and function, and long-term incidence of ischemic stroke in the general population [^117CZx8z]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. Emerging evidence suggests an association between left atrial (LA) structural, mechanical, and electrical abnormalities and increased risk of ischemic stroke. The term atrial cardiomyopathy has been proposed as an entity including the spectrum of these abnormalities. According to this theory, atrial cardiomyopathy is a condition of the LA in which atrial fibrillation (AF) is a secondary manifestation and an exacerbating factor. It has been speculated that atrial cardiomyopathy is the primary driver of thrombus development in the LA, even in the absence of AF.

As potential structural and functional components of atrial cardiomyopathy, LA enlargement and a low LA emptying fraction (LAEF) have in previous studies been associated with incident AF, subclinical cerebrovascular disease, recurrence of ischemic stroke, and death. Moreover, prospective studies have related LA size and functional parameters to the risk of ischemic vascular events. Nonetheless, only 1 study has previously associated LA volumetric and functional parameters with a first incident ischemic cardiovascular event, defined as either ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) in a population free of AF or prior stroke. This study used cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) to assess LA function and demonstrated that reduced LAEF was associated with the combined end point of ischemic cardiovascular event.CMR has excellent spatial resolution and contrast but is hampered by high costs and limited availability.

Additional studies are needed to substantiate these findings. To our knowledge, no study has investigated long‐term follow‐up of LA volumes and LAEF measured with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and the risk of ischemic stroke as the primary end point in the general population without evident AF or prior ischemic stroke. We examined whether increasing baseline LA volumes and reduced LAEF are associated with the development of ischemic stroke independently of incident AF.

### Efficacy of low-voltage-area ablation is enhanced in patients with advanced left atrial enlargement: a subanalysis of the SUPPRESS-AF trial [^116BQRXC]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is the cornerstone of ablation for persistent atrial fibrillation (AF), but its therapeutic effect is unsatisfactory. Low-voltage areas (LVAs) are thought to be associated with degenerated myocardium, including fibrosis, and possibly involve arrhythmogenic substrate serving as AF maintenance. Although several randomized controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy of ablation targeting LVAs, the efficacy of LVA ablation (LVA-ABL) was inconsistent. – The randomized controlled SUPPRESS-AF trial (Efficacy and Safety of Left Atrial Low-voltage Area Guided Ablation for Recurrence Prevention Compared to Pulmonary Vein Isolation Alone in Patients with Persistent Atrial Fibrillation) showed that, although the efficacy of LVA-ABL was not statistically significant in total patients, the efficacy, nevertheless, appeared highly dependent on the degree of atrial remodeling.

Left atrial enlargement is a well-known clinical feature of atrial remodeling. In patients undergoing AF ablation, left atrial enlargement has been repeatedly reported to be associated with poor rhythm outcomes. We, therefore, speculated that left atrial size may be used to identify a subset of patients who would benefit from LVA-ABL.

Here, we conducted a subanalysis of the SUPPRES-AF trial to investigate the efficacy of LVA-ABL in addition to PVI in subgroups classified by left atrial size.

### Left atrial roof enlargement is a distinct feature of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^1152wgh3]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Advances in noninvasive imaging and computational postprocessing now allow for detailed analysis of cardiac remodelingand potentially mechanistic insights into remodeling caused by diastolic dysfunction. Moreover, cardiovascular computational modeling has now reached maturity, providing access to new biomarkers, while statistical models — atlases of the heart — have demonstrated the importance of shape in the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. Specifically, comprehensive automated atrial remodeling assessment has previously demonstrated a predictive value for reoccurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) following pulmonary vein (PV) ablation. These postprocessing analyses can be used on widely available routinely acquired balanced steady-state free-precession cine sequences at rest. Consequently, we sought to assesses LA remodeling in HFpEF, to identify specific remodeling features and to assess their clinical value.

### Left atrial structure and function across the spectrum of cardiovascular risk in the elderly: the atherosclerosis risk in communities study [^1174NmmL]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Although left atrial (LA) enlargement is a recognized risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes, emerging evidence supports the importance of LA function. We examined LA emptying fraction (LAEF) across the spectrum of cardiovascular disease burden in a large cohort of elderly adults living in the community.

Methods and Results

We studied 1142 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study who were in sinus rhythm, free of valvular disease, and had acceptable quality 3-dimensional echocardiograms (mean age, 76 ± 5 years; 59% women). We determined the cross-sectional correlates of LAEF and compared LAEF among elderly adults without cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors (n = 201), those with hypertension (n = 734), and those with overt heart failure (HF; n = 207). In multivariable analysis, lower LAEF was associated with higher LA volumes and worse left ventricular systolic and diastolic functions. Elderly participants free of cardiovascular disease or risk factors had smaller LA volumes than those with hypertension (LA volume max/ body surface area 30.2 ± 6.6 versus 33.0 ± 9.0 mL/m(2); P = 0.001), but similar LAEF (55.2 ± 10.3% versus 53.8 ± 11.5%, respectively; P = 0.357). Participants with HF had higher LA volume (39.8 ± 13.3 mL/m(2)) and worse LAEF (47.6 ± 14.6%) than participants with hypertension or participants free of cardiovascular disease or risk factors (all P < 0.001).

Conclusions

In a community-based cohort, LA function was impaired in participants with prevalent HF, but there were no significant differences in LA function between participants with hypertension and those with free of cardiovascular disease or risk factors, despite greater LA size in the former.

### NT pro-BNP can be used as a risk predictor of clinical atrial fibrillation with or without left atrial enlargement [^111Q1pKD]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

To exclude the interference of increased NT Pro‐BNP caused by left ventricular enlargement, we first needed to verify whether there were differences in left ventricular enlargement between the AF and non‐AF groups. Therefore, the end diastolic diameter of the left ventricle in the AF group and the non‐AF group was statistically analyzed, and there was no statistical difference between the two groups (p > .05).

After excluding the interference of left ventricular enlargement on NT Pro‐BNP, we needed to further investigate the effect of left atrial enlargement on NT Pro‐BNP secretion in patients with AF. Whether the increase of NT Pro‐BNP in AF group was caused by left atrial enlargement, or whether AF could still increase NT Pro‐BNP even without left atrial enlargement.

Therefore, Subgroup analysis was performed on the AF group and non‐AF group. We found that compared with the Left atrial normal group in AF, the Left atrial enlargement group in AF experienced an statistical increase in NT Pro‐BNP (p < .001). Enlargement of the left atrium leads to an increase in NT Pro‐BNP.

The main stimulus for cardiac NT Pro‐BNP secretion is myocardial stretch. The enlargement of the left atrium usually stimulates the increase of NT Pro‐BNP. The experimental results also prove that when the left atrium expands, NT Pro‐BNP increases. However, how does the level of NT Pro‐BNP change in AF patients without left atrial enlargement? To further investigate this problem, we compared the left atrial normal group in AF with the left atrial normal group in non‐AF, and found that the level of NT Pro‐BNP in the left atrial normal group in AF was also statistically higher than that in the non‐AF group (p < .001).

Through the above research results we found that even without obvious left atrial enlargement of AF, minor, irregular and asynchronous atrial myocardial stretch during AF may still lead to changes in myocardial stretch, which may also lead to the increase of NT Pro‐BNP.

The results of this experiment showed that: regardless of the presence or absence of enlarged left atrium, the NT Pro‐BNP in the AF group was significantly higher than that of the non‐AF group. NT Pro‐BNP can be a risk factor for the occurrence of AF, no matter with or without the influence of enlarged left atrium.

### Atrial fibrillation in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: prevalence, clinical correlations, and mortality in a large high-risk population [^1138AqdP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Echocardiographic Correlates

Left atrial enlargement is an established predictor of the development of AF in HCM, and our study confirms previous findings. We have previously demonstrated the correlation between LAVI and invasive filling pressures. Left atrial enlargement is a multifactorial process in HCM dependent upon obstructive physiology, intrinsic myocardial stiffness, mitral regurgitation, and rhythm disturbances. Previous studies in general patient populations have clearly demonstrated associations between large left atria and risk for incident and recurrent atrial fibrillation, – but whether left atrial enlargement in HCM is a secondary phenomenon or precipitator of AF, or a combination of both, remains undetermined.

In this cohort, patients with obstructive HCM were less likely to have AF, regardless of the analyses and adjustments performed. A positive correlation between LVOT obstruction and AF has been previously found in some studies, – whereas there was no association in others. It should be noted, however, that assessment of LVOT obstruction in HCM can be complex because of its dynamic nature. In an attempt to control for such variability, in this study we utilized a comprehensive evaluation of obstruction, rather than relying on a single parameter. It is possible that nonobstructive HCM patients had worse diastolic function, in which case the finding of higher prevalence of AF in these patients would not be totally unexpected. Unfortunately, evaluation of diastolic function in HCM is challenging, especially when the underlying rhythm is AF. Therefore, our findings of higher E/e' and shorter deceleration times among patients with AF should be interpreted with caution.

Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing and AF

Reduced functional capacity, as assessed with metabolic exercise testing, confers important diagnostic and prognostic information in HCM. – In our cohort, patients with AF had significantly worse exercise capacity. Invariably, patients with HCM have some degree of restrictive ventricular filling, so the loss of coordinated atrial contraction can result in significant increases in LA pressure and the subsequent development of symptoms under exercise conditions. Also, both AF and decreased exercise capacity may be adverse consequences of progressive structural and functional changes in HCM. Our practice is to incorporate cardiopulmonary testing as part of the routine initial and follow‐up evaluation of HCM patients to identify changes in exercise capacity (in addition to SCD stratification) and to optimize treatment.

### AHA / ACCF / HRS recommendations for the standardization and interpretation of the electrocardiogram: part V: electrocardiogram changes associated with cardiac chamber hypertrophy: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association electrocardiography and arrhythmias committee, council on clinical cardiology; the American college of cardiology foundation; and the Heart Rhythm Society: endorsed by the international society for computerized electrocardiology [^1175mDSu]. Circulation (2009). Medium credibility.

Atrial abnormality recommendations — Abnormal P waves should usually be referred to as right or left "atrial abnormality" rather than enlargement, overload, strain, or hypertrophy; multiple electrocardiographic criteria should be used to recognize atrial abnormalities; and intraatrial conduction delay should be recognized as a category of atrial abnormality applicable particularly to instances where P-wave widening is not accompanied by increased amplitude of right or left atrial components.

### Prediction of cardiovascular outcomes with left atrial size: is volume superior to area or diameter? [^115uDwb4]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to compare left atrial (LA) volume to LA area and diameter for the prediction of adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

Background

The incremental value of LA volume compared with LA area or diameter as a cardiovascular risk marker has not been evaluated prospectively for patients with sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation (AF).

Methods

Left atrial size was assessed with biplane LA volume, four-chamber LA area, and M-mode dimension for 423 patients (mean age 71 ± 8 years, 56% men) who were prospectively followed for development of first AF, congestive heart failure, stroke, transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, and cardiovascular death.

Results

Of the 317 subjects in sinus rhythm at baseline, 62 had 90 new events during a mean follow-up of 3.5 ± 2.3 years. All three LA size parameters were independently predictive of combined outcomes (all p < 0.0001). The overall performance for the prediction of cardiovascular events was greatest for LA volume (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve: indexed LA volume 0.71; LA area 0.64; LA diameter 0.59). A graded association between the degree of LA enlargement and risk of cardiovascular events was only evident for indexed LA volume. For subjects with AF, there was no association between LA size and cardiovascular events.

Conclusions

Left atrial volume is a more robust marker of cardiovascular events than LA area or diameter in subjects with sinus rhythm. The predictive utility of LA size for cardiovascular events in AF was poor, irrespective of the method of LA size quantitation.

### Left atrial roof enlargement is a distinct feature of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^112BSf4K]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Based on the data collected in the HFpEF-Stress trial, this substudy identified 2 key features in LA anatomic remodeling in HFpEF: global enlargement and roof dilatation. Importantly, roof dilatation precedes atrial enlargement in masked HFpEF, the latter being the dominant pattern in overt HFpEF. Quantification of LA remodeling into a single LAHS score allows noninvasive discrimination between symptomatic patients with HFpEF and NCD and is associated with a history of AF and risk for cardiovascular hospitalization.

### Left atrium and cardiovascular risk: does functionality matter more than size? [^116x54T1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The association between echocardiographic parameters of atrial remodeling and AF has also been extensively documented. In a case‐control cohort, structural and functional LA remodeling assessed by echocardiogram were independently and strongly associated with paroxysmal AF. 16 Assessment of LA size and function has also been useful to predict the success of restoring sinus rhythm in patients with AF after either direct‐current cardioversion 17 or catheter ablation. 18 Electrophysiologic mapping studies have demonstrated that these echocardiographic markers of remodeling are associated with both electrical conduction slowing and regional atrial fibrosis; both are also strongly linked to progression of AF. 19 More recently, a retrospective cohort study of patients with AF showed that more severe LA fibrosis, as detected by late gadolinium enhancement on cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging, was associated with increased major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular event risk, driven primarily by increased risk of stroke or transient ischemic attack. 20

### Correlates of left atrial size in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy: the losartan intervention for endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study [^115cP8j5]. Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Left ventricular hypertrophy has been suggested to mediate the relation between hypertension and left atrial enlargement, with associated risks of atrial fibrillation and stroke. However, less is known about correlates of left atrial size in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. We assessed left atrial size by echocardiography in 941 hypertensive patients, age 55 to 80 (mean, 66) years, with electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy at baseline in the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension study. Enlarged left atrial diameter (women, > 3.8 cm; men, > 4.2 cm) was present in 56% of women and 38% of men (P < 0.01). Compared with the 512 patients with normal left atrial size, the 429 patients with enlarged left atrium more often had mitral regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, and echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy. They also had higher age, systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, weight, body mass index, left ventricular internal chamber dimension, stroke volume, and mass and lower relative wall thickness and ejection fraction (all, P < 0.05). In logistic regression analysis, left atrial enlargement was related to left ventricular hypertrophy and eccentric geometry; greater body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and age; female gender; mitral regurgitation; and atrial fibrillation (all, P < 0.05). Thus, left atrial size in hypertensive patients with electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy is influenced by gender, age, obesity, systolic blood pressure, and left ventricular geometry independently of left ventricular mass and presence of mitral regurgitation or atrial fibrillation.

### Impact of blood pressure in the early 40s on left atrial volumes in the mid-60s: data from the ACE 1950 study [^116wsxwe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Long‐term LA dilatation is attributable to increased left ventricular filling pressure caused by increased arterial blood pressure, even in the mild range. Correspondingly, and similar to Ghosh et al, we found a significant association between systolic blood pressure and the echocardiograhic index reflecting increased filling pressure of the left ventricle (the E/e' ratio). The hemodynamic consequence of a passive backward propagation of the high pressure on the left side of the heart can be increased pulmonary blood pressure. This was also observed in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in the Olmsted study. The present study demonstrated an association between systolic blood pressure and tricuspid regurgitation peak velocity, reflecting increased pulmonary pressure, and also with increased right ventricular and atrial size. Although these associations were weak, they imply that increased arterial blood pressure over a long time span may also impact the pulmonary circulation and the right side of the heart.

The total time with elevated blood pressure is already regarded as important in developing cardiovascular disease, mainly left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Our data are only observational, but they add to the body of evidence that early onset of increased blood pressure is relevant for LA remodeling. The physiological explanation for LAVi max being a predictor of clinical outcomes is not fully understood. Still, it has been suggested that it may be a marker of underlying diastolic dysfunction, which is the actual clinical determinant of poor outcome. One study from the general population found that LAVi max lost its prognostic abilities of all‐cause mortality when also adjusting for other diastolic dysfunction parameters. In the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) Study, Teramoto et al studied the effect of cumulative blood pressure on cardiac structure and heart failure as clinical end points. The study demonstrated an effect on LAVi max from cumulative systolic blood pressure, which was also associated with incident heart failure, particularly heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Furthermore, in the CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) Study with a similar number of participants as in our study, the effects of cumulative blood pressure over 25 years on left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction were investigated. The authors found an effect on diastolic dysfunction evaluated as E/e′ ratio > 15, notably a more prominent effect from diastolic blood pressure. However, LAVi max was more affected by systolic blood pressure. In a recent pooled population study, hypertension was associated with a greater attributable risk of heart failure in young individuals. Earlier age of onset of hypertension has been demonstrated to be associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and Mendelian randomization studies support this notion.

### European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) / European association of cardiovascular prevention and rehabilitation (EACPR) position paper on how to prevent atrial fibrillation endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) and Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society (APHRS) [^112vfYE9]. Europace (2017). Medium credibility.

Post-operative atrial fibrillation — after cardiac surgery occurs in ∼30% of patients and is also frequent after thoracic surgery. This arrhythmia is associated with higher occurrence of heart failure and stroke, both resulting in increased hospitalization and healthcare costs, and also correlating with a higher rate of other serious complications including increased risk of in-hospital morbidity and mortality and increased long-term risk of stroke. Post-operative AF usually is developed between Days 1 and 4 after surgical intervention. The mechanisms underlying AF after cardiac surgery are not completely understood but are thought to be multifactorial, and numerous predisposing factors such as advanced age, hypertension, diabetes, left atrial enlargement, left ventricular hypertrophy, type of intervention, cardiac valvular disease, and intra-operative or post-operative atrial injury or ischaemia can favour development.

### Reverse remodeling of the left cardiac chambers after catheter ablation after 1 year in a series of patients with isolated atrial fibrillation [^112zPL7E]. Circulation (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Isolated atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with mild enlargement of the left atrium (LA) and left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction. The impact of ablation of isolated AF on left chamber size and function is unclear, and whether diastolic dysfunction is the cause or the consequence of AF remains unknown. The objective of this prospective study was to evaluate the impact of sinus rhythm restoration by catheter ablation on LV diastolic dysfunction, LA morphology, and mechanical function.

Methods and Results

Forty-eight patients with isolated AF were studied by serial echocardiographic studies at baseline and at 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month intervals after radiofrequency ablation. LA dimensions and mechanical function and LV systolic and diastolic functions were evaluated at each time interval. Diastolic function was assessed with conventional Doppler parameters and new indexes such as tissue Doppler imaging, mitral flow propagation velocity, and combined criteria. LV diastolic dysfunction was present in paroxysmal and chronic AF patients with a reduction of tissue Doppler imaging lateral early diastolic peak velocity in 37% (P < 0.001) and 48% (P < 0.01), respectively, compared with healthy control subjects. At the end of the follow-up, LA area decreased significantly by 18% (P < 0.001) in paroxysmal and 23% (P < 0.05) in chronic AF patients. Diastolic function improved significantly with an increase in lateral early diastolic peak velocity of 29% (P < 0.001) in paroxysmal AF and 46% (P < 0.05) in chronic AF patients. A significant increase in LV ejection fraction was also noted for both groups: 7.7% and 18.8%, respectively.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates reverse morphological remodeling of the LA and improvement of LV diastolic and systolic functions after restoration of sinus rhythm by ablation for isolated AF. Because patients with isolated AF have none of the traditional causes of LV diastolic dysfunction, our findings suggest that AF may be partly the cause rather than the consequence of diastolic dysfunction.

### Prevention of sudden cardiac death in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: risk assessment using left atrial diameter predicted from left atrial volume [^11681Biv]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The most common causes of left atrial enlargement in HCM are systolic anterior movement (SAM) with related mitral regurgitation and elevated left ventricular filling pressures (diastolic dysfunction). Several prospective studies have shown that left atrial enlargement is present in approximately one‐third of patients with HCM and that left atrial size provides important prognostic information. 17, 18, 19 Patients with HCM and left atrial enlargement are more likely to suffer from major adverse cardiac and cardiovascular events, including atrial fibrillation, stroke, sudden death, and congestive heart failure than patients without left atrial enlargement. 20 Losi et al. imply in their study that the prognostic power of LAd is lower than the prognostic power of LAv, and that LAv may be a more reliable predictor of prognosis in HCM patients. 17 The prognostic importance of left atrial size emphasizes the need for an accurate method for determination of the size. Three‐dimensional assessment of left atrial size using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging or 3D echocardiography is not always as easily available and applicable as 2D echocardiography in a clinical setting.

We showed that using LAd predicted from LAv had a good agreement with the original risk prediction model using measured LAd, on a population level. On an individual level, only few patients were recategorized into a different category of SCD risk when using LAd predicted from LAv. To put the observed change in SCD risk score when using LAd predicted from LAv instead of LAd in perspective, we must also consider that the seven clinical predictors used in the SCD risk score are not constant over time for the individual patient. The literature on how much SCD risk scores vary from one outpatient visit to another is scarce, but clinical experience shows that the risk estimation for one patient may vary from one visit to another due to inaccuracy of, for example, MWT measurements and/or inaccuracy of measurement of the maximal LVOT gradient as well as physiological variability. When considering this variability, the recategorization of patients in our study, which is due to minor changes in the estimated SCD risk, may be of no clinical significance regarding the risk estimation of SCD.

### Long-term clinical outcomes in patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation [^1161zttR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 4
Diagram of association between advanced TR and multiorgan damages.

LA indicates left atrial; LV, left ventricular; and TR, tricuspid regurgitation.

Pulmonary hypertension causes right ventricular pressure overload, leading to progression of TR. Conversely, TR may be a cause of pulmonary hypertension. With increasing TR, the right ventricle dilates and causes increased right ventricular diastolic pressure and, in an advanced situation, a shift of the interventricular septum toward the left ventricle. Such ventricular interdependence might cause restricted left ventricular filling and elevated left ventricular end‐diastolic pressure and pulmonary artery pressure. Butcher et al reported that TR reduces cardiac output and adversely affects renal function via a reduced left ventricular end‐diastolic volume attributable to right ventricular enlargement. However, it is difficult to determine whether pulmonary hypertension was a cause or a consequence of the TR. Left atrial enlargement is caused by volume and pressure loading of the left atrium. LAVi has been used not only to assess left atrial enlargement but also as a measure of left ventricular diastolic capacity. Although TR is not directly related to LA dilation, atrial fibrillation or left ventricular diastolic dysfunction may be related to ventricular septal exhaustion, similar to the mechanism of pulmonary hypertension. The combined use of Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion and estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure, which reflect right ventricle–pulmonary artery coupling, is also reportedly a poor prognostic factor in patients with TR.

Currently, there are no clear recommendations other than echocardiographic findings for the timing of surgical intervention for isolated severe TR. In a recent study examining all‐cause mortality in patients with isolated secondary TR, the authors reported a 5‐year survival rate of 47.2%, which was worse than our study's rate. These differences may be explained by left ventricular ejection fraction (50% ± 15% versus 59% ± 10%), the prevalence of lung disease, and other organ involvement. Another study reported that rapid progression to severe TR was associated with higher mortality rates. Fortuni et al proposed a new algorithm for grading TR, suggesting that a combined assessment of vena contracta width and effective regurgitant orifice area has prognostic value.

On the basis of our results, the nutritional status, the presence of liver and renal dysfunction, and left atrial enlargement should be given more attention when considering the timing of intervention in patients with isolated severe TR. However, whether interventions based on these indicators will improve outcomes is unknown. Future studies are warranted to determine whether early intervention before the emergence of poor prognostic factors can improve outcomes in patients with severe TR.

### The impact of demographic, anthropometric and athletic characteristics on left atrial size in athletes [^117XE4Ze]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The structural adaptations of the "athlete's heart" include left atrial (LA) enlargement. A literature search was performed based on PubMed listings up to November 2, 2019 using "athletes AND left atrium", "athletes AND LA", "sports AND left atrium", "sports AND LA", "exercise AND left atrium", and "exercise AND LA" as the search terms. Eligible studies included those reporting the influence of demographic, anthropometric and athletic characteristics on LA size in athletes. A total of 58 studies were included in this review article. Although LA volume has been reported to be greater in males compared to females when indexed for body surface area (BSA), there was no difference between sexes. The positive association between LA size and age in athletes may reflect the increase in body size with maturation in nonadult athletes and the training age of endurance athletic activity in adult athletes. Caucasian and black athletes have been demonstrated to exhibit similar LA enlargement. The positive association of LA size with lean body mass (LBM) possibly accounts for the relationship of LA size with BSA. LA enlargement has been reported only in endurance‐trained, but not in strength‐trained athletes. LA size appears to increase with an increase in both the volume and intensity of endurance training. LA size correlates independently with the training age of endurance athletes. The athlete's characteristics that independently determine LA size include LBM, endurance training, and training age.

Left atrial morphology in hypertension — measurement, normal range, and prognostic meaning: Left atrial (LA) volume may be calculated by either area-length method or modified Simpson's methods, is usually scaled for body surface area (BSA) and expressed in ml/m2; the normal range is up to and including 34 ml/m2, and LA size is much better evaluated with 2D- or 3D-based LA volume rather than with M-mode. In hypertension and other situations where diastolic dysfunction occurs, reduction in early diastolic emptying is compensated by forceful atrial contraction; in addition, intermittent or permanent elevation of LV filling pressures leads to overfilling of the LA, and the resulting LA enlargement is the 'morphophysiologic expression' of chronic diastolic dysfunction, hypothesized to reflect the duration and severity of increased LA pressures. Although atrial fibrillation contributes to atrial size, LA enlargement is a well-known independent determinant of stroke, cardiovascular events, and death, and atrial fibrosis may further predispose to atrial remodeling and dysfunction with atrial fibrillation; this is a common endpoint that may be initiated by a number of aetiologies, including hypertension and diabetes mellitus.

Management considerations in patients with AF and obesity — risk magnitude: Overweight and obesity increased the risk of incident atrial fibrillation (AF), with a 4% increase in AF risk per unit increase in body mass index (BMI) in men and women, and adjusted hazard ratios for AF associated with obesity were 1.52 (95% CI, 1.09–2.13; P = 0.02) for men and 1.46 (95% CI, 1.03–2.07; P = 0.03) for women compared with individuals with normal BMI; the excess risk appeared to be mediated through left atrial dilatation.

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to patients with atrial flutter, anticoagulation, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating long-term anticoagulation after successful cavotricuspid isthmus ablation in patients with typical atrial flutter without any known previous history of AF at high risk for development of AF (such as left atrium enlargement, inducible AF, COPD, HF) if thromboembolic risk assessment suggests high risk (> 2% annual risk) for stroke.

### Hypertension and atrial fibrillation: epidemiology, pathophysiology and therapeutic implications [^117Ht6WR]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Hypertension is one of the most important risk factors associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) and increased the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with AF. However, the pathophysiological link between hypertension and AF is unclear. Nevertheless, this can be explained by the hemodynamic changes of the left atrium secondary to long standing hypertension, resulting in elevated left atrium pressure and subsequently left atrial enlargement. Moreover, the activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activation in patients with hypertension induces left atrial fibrosis and conduction block in the left atrium, resulting in the development of AF. Accordingly, recent studies have shown that effective blockage of RAAS by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonist may be effective in both primary and secondary prevention of AF in patients with hypertension, although with controversies. In addition, optimal antithrombotic therapy, blood pressure control as well as rate control for AF are key to the management of patients with AF.

### Atrial fibrillation: hypertension as a causative agent, risk factor for complications, and potential therapeutic target [^116cpS5j]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation and hypertension are 2 prevalent, and often coexistent, conditions in the North American population. Their incidence increases with advancing age, and they are responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality. Although the relation between the 2 conditions has long been known, the treatment of hypertension is not currently a focus in the clinical management of atrial fibrillation. Hypertension is associated with left ventricular hypertrophy, impaired ventricular filling, left atrial enlargement, and slowing of atrial conduction velocity. These changes in cardiac structure and physiology favor the development of atrial fibrillation, and they increase the risk of thromboembolic complications. Conventional therapy of atrial fibrillation has focused on interventions to control heart rate and rhythm and the prevention of stroke through the use of anticoagulant medications. In patients with atrial fibrillation, aggressive treatment of hypertension may reverse the structural changes in the heart, reduce thromboembolic complications, and retard or prevent the occurrence of atrial fibrillation. Specific pharmacotherapy could potentially play a major role in the primary and secondary prevention of atrial fibrillation and its complications.

### Late outcome of surgical radiofrequency ablation for persistent valvular atrial fibrillation in China: a single-center study [^1134UyoS]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

In present investigation, we found a lower sinus conversion rate was associated with a longer AF duration and a larger LAD. Of particular interest, left atrial size and AF duration are significantly and mutually related to each other. Many clinical investigations have recognized left atrial dilatation as a cause of AF. Left atrial dilatation, on the other hand, may also be a consequence of AF. Therefore, they together aggravate atrial fibrosis and remodeling, making patients more susceptible to experience a recurrence of AF. Melo et al. believed that AF duration > 4 years and LAD > 5.5 cm are the boundaries to predict the efficacy of surgical treatment via the maze procedure. The data from Zongtao et al. showed that AF duration ≥ 7 years and LAD ≥ 58 mm increased the AF recurrence rate by more than twofold. Herein, we found that AF duration ≥ 66.5 months and pre-operative LAD ≥ 67.9 mm indicated a significantly higher ratio of AF recurrence. It has slightly expanded the previous indications for the efficacy of the surgical maze procedure.

Baseline serum BNP had been previously found predicting short-term recurrence in patients undergoing catheter ablation of AF. Herein, we also identified that pre-operative serum BNP level ≥ 251 pg/ml was associated with a much lower post-ablation freedom from AF. The increased atrial stretch associated with increased left atrial volume can be responsible for the elevated levels of plasma BNP, because BNP is released primarily from the atria. Increased wall stress by the diastolic dysfunction itself that frequently coexists with AF may also induce the release of BNP from the ventricle. Such complex and various mechanisms regarding to BNP release may make its levels heterogeneous among individuals with AF, consequently making its clinical role unclear. In our patients with left atrial enlargement and long-standing AF, BNP level was bound to be more elevated, because they were significantly correlated with each other. However, due to lacking consecutive monitoring of BNP after surgery, the role of post-operative BNP for predicting SR stabilization is unknown.

Atrial septal defect therapeutic indications — Class I recommendations specify that in adults with isolated secundum ASD causing impaired functional capacity, right atrial and/or RV enlargement, and net left-to-right shunt sufficiently large to cause physiological sequelae (eg, pulmonary-systemic blood flow ratio [Qp:Qs] ≥ 1.5:1) without cyanosis at rest or during exercise, transcatheter or surgical closure to reduce RV volume and improve exercise tolerance is recommended, provided that systolic PA pressure is less than 50% of systemic pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance is less than one third of the systemic vascular resistance. Adults with primum ASD, sinus venosus defect or coronary sinus defect causing impaired functional capacity, right atrial and/or RV enlargement and net left-to-right shunt sufficiently large to cause physiological sequelae (eg, Qp:Qs ≥ 1.5:1) without cyanosis at rest or during exercise, should be surgically repaired unless precluded by comorbidities, provided that systolic PA pressure is less than 50% of systemic pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance is less than one third of the systemic vascular resistance.

### Left atrial disease and left atrial reverse remodelling across different stages of heart failure development and progression: a new target for prevention and treatment [^112r2P7D]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation

The relationship between LA remodelling and AF is reciprocal. The progression of LA disease may predispose to the occurrence of AF and, on the other hand, AF perpetuates and might worsen adverse LA remodelling in a vicious circle. The basis of this process seems to be related, at least in part, to an inflammatory state and the development of fibrosis. In addition, the structural alterations associated with an enlarged LA lead to electrical remodelling.

Reverse remodelling identified by a shrinking LA volume has been associated with fewer AF recurrences in HF patients. Several studies have demonstrated the benefits of both medical therapy and catheter ablation on LA reverse remodelling (Table 3). Even in animal models of HF due to rapid atrial pacing, the use of ACEi or ARB resulted in a significant LA size reduction and decreased amount of fibrosis. The reduction of LA fibrosis has also been reported in one human study. The amount of collagen I was higher in AF versus sinus rhythm patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Interestingly, when divided into groups with or without ACEi treatment, there was a significant lower expression of collagen in AF with ACEi versus AF without ACEi.

The extent of pre‐existing fibrosis is a crucial determinant of interventional success in patients undergoing AF treatment. Pre‐procedural LA strain is associated with rhythm outcome after LA catheter ablation. Despite ablation itself may result in increased LA fibrosis, performing the procedure has shown to favour LA reverse remodelling. Two studies reported LA response to catheter ablation or surgical treatment of AF. In one study, LA reverse remodelling (Table 2) occurred in 63% of patients undergoing radiofrequency catheter ablation. While LA maximum volume and LA minimum volume significantly decreased in the overall population, only the responder group reported a significant increase in LA strain. In this study, baseline LA strain and LA maximum volume were independent predictors of LA reverse remodelling. Similarly, in a cohort of patients who underwent surgical treatment of AF, 73% had LA reverse remodelling after a 12‐month follow‐up.

Introduction — adult secundum atrial septal defect epidemiology and sequelae: Atrial septal defect is described as the most prevalent congenital heart disease lesion in the adult population with congenital heart disease, with secundum ASD accounting for > 90% of observed cases. A significant left-to-right shunt results in right ventricular volume overload and an increase in pulmonary blood flow, which in turn results in right heart failure with fatigue and exercise intolerance. Atrial arrhythmias resulting from atrial enlargement develop with age, conferring a higher risk of thromboembolic complications even after repair.

Atrial septal defects (ASDs) — clinical features and treatment principles: ASDs are common and may occur as a consequence of different anatomic defects; left-to-right shunting may result in right heart enlargement and right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, while some patients may have right-to-left shunting or paradoxical embolism; percutaneous device or surgical closure are the mainstays of therapy in those with hemodynamic or clinical consequences, and severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a contraindication to closure that must be accurately excluded before closure.

### Predictors and impact of postoperative atrial fibrillation following thoracic surgery: a state-of-the-art review [^117T57ei]. Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

This review of 19 studies (39,783 patients) of atrial fibrillation after thoracic surgery addresses the pathophysiology, incidence, and consequences of atrial fibrillation in this population, as well as its prevention and management. Interestingly, atrial fibrillation was most often identified in patients not previously known to have the disease. Rhythm control with amiodarone was the most commonly used treatment and nearly all patients were discharged in sinus rhythm. Major predictors were age; male sex; history of atrial fibrillation; congestive heart failure; left atrial enlargement; elevated brain natriuretic peptide level; and the invasiveness of procedures. Overall, patients with atrial fibrillation stayed 3days longer in hospital. We also discuss the importance of standardising research on this subject and provide recommendations that might mitigate the impact postoperative atrial fibrillation on hospital resources.

### Left atrial enlargement and risk of ischemic stroke in elderly treated hypertensive patients [^116kQjnD]. American Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The independent prognostic significance of left atrial enlargement is not yet completely clear. We investigated the association between left atrial enlargement and risk of ischemic stroke in elderly treated hypertensive patients.

Methods

The occurrence of ischemic stroke was evaluated in 1,191 elderly treated hypertensive patients (age range = 60–90 years). Left atrium diameter (cm) was indexed by body surface area (m(2)) and subjects were divided into those with normal or enlarged (≥ 2.4cm/m(2)) left atrium.

Results

During the follow-up (9.1 ± 4.9 years; range = 0.4–20 years), 139 ischemic strokes occurred. The event rate per 100 patient-years was 1.28. There were 86 strokes in patients with normal (= 928) left atrium and 53 strokes in patients with enlarged (= 263) left atrium, respectively. Stroke-free survival curves were significantly different between the groups (P < 0.01). After adjustment for various covariables, including clinical variables, left ventricular hypertrophy, and ambulatory blood pressure parameters, Cox regression analysis showed that left atrial enlargement was significantly associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke (hazard ratio = 1.54; 95% confidence interval = 1.05–2.27; P = 0.03).

Conclusions

### Association of left atrial enlargement and atrial fibrillation with cognitive function and decline: the ARIC-NCS [^114VGLHP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF), a common sustained arrhythmia that affects > 2.7 million people in the United States, is associated with increased incidence of stroke, coronary heart disease, and heart failure. 1, 2 More recently, compelling evidence has emerged to indicate that AF is also associated with greater risk of cognitive decline and dementia. 3 Left atrial enlargement (LAE), commonly present in patients with AF, is also associated with increased incidence of stroke, coronary heart disease, and heart failure. 4, 5, 6, 7 However, whether it is LAE or concomitant AF that is associated with lower cognitive function remains unclear.

A few studies have explored the association between LAE and cognitive function. van den Hurk et al found that higher left atrium (LA) volume index was associated with lower information‐processing speed. 8 Karadag et al reported that LAE was associated with lower Mini‐Mental State Examination scores, 9 and Alosco et al found that LAE was associated with reduced performance on the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. 10 All 3 studies were limited by small sample sizes, limited cognitive testing, cross‐sectional design, and not accounting for the effect of concomitant AF. In particular, cross‐sectional analysis is suboptimal because it cannot adequately control for all relevant characteristics that could differ among study participants. 11

Therefore, to better characterize the relationship between LAE and cognitive function, we performed comprehensive evaluation of the association of LAE with the cognitive domains of memory, executive function, language, and global cognition among participants, with and without AF, who were enrolled in the ARIC‐NCS (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Neurocognitive Study). We also performed a follow‐up evaluation to evaluate longitudinal cognitive decline.

### ACC / AHA / ESC 2006 guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines and the European Society of Cardiology committee for practice guidelines (writing committee to revise the 2001 guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation): developed in collaboration with the European Heart Rhythm Association and the Heart Rhythm Society [^112K3XaH]. Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — thromboembolic mechanisms and stroke risk highlight inflammatory activation, local left atrial coagulation, hemodynamic factors, age, and ventricular dysfunction. C-reactive protein is increased and correlates with stroke risk factors, and in rheumatic mitral stenosis coagulation markers (including prothrombin fragment F1.2) are increased in the left atrium versus the right atrium and femoral vein, indicating regional activation. Contrary to the concept that systemic anticoagulation for 4 wk organizes left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombus, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has verified resolution of thrombus in the majority of patients. Hypertension in AF is associated with reduced LAA flow velocity, spontaneous echo contrast (SEC), and thrombus formation, and aging in AF is associated with left atrial enlargement, reduced LAA flow velocity, and SEC, with prothrombin activation fragment F1.2 increasing with age. In the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation studies, age combined with other risk factors places women over age 75 y with AF at particular risk for cardioembolic strokes. LV systolic dysfunction predicts ischemic stroke in AF patients who receive no antithrombotic therapy but not in moderate-risk patients given aspirin.

### Left atrial size in children with hypertension: the influence of obesity, blood pressure, and left ventricular mass [^112tpx8m]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the prevalence of left atrial enlargement and the correlates of left atrial size in children and adolescents with essential hypertension.

Background

Left atrial enlargement has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including stroke in adults. Risk factors for left atrial size in adults with hypertension include age, race, and obesity.

Methods and Results

Patients (n = 112; average age, 14.2 years) with essential hypertension were studied with echocardiography. The average left atrial dimension was 2.8 (± 0.5) cm; 51% patients had left atrial dimension > 95% upper confidence limit. The patients with left atrial enlargement had greater body mass index (P < .05) than those without left atrial enlargement. In multiple regression analysis, height, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and left ventricular geometry were significant independent correlates of left atrial size. Children with eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy were more likely to have a larger left atrial dimension.

Conclusions

Left atrial enlargement is prevalent in children and adolescents with essential hypertension. This may indicate an increased risk of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Control of obesity and blood pressure elevation offer two approaches for treatment that may prevent left atrial enlargement.

### Left atrial enlargement and stroke recurrence: the Northern manhattan stroke study [^114gARrt]. Stroke (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Although left atrial enlargement (LAE) increases incident stroke risk, the association with recurrent stroke is less clear. Our aim was to determine the association of LAE with recurrent stroke most likely related to embolism (cryptogenic and cardioembolic) and all ischemic stroke recurrences.

Methods

We followed 655 first ischemic stroke patients in the Northern Manhattan Stroke Study for ≤ 5 years. LA size from 2D echocardiography was categorized as normal LAE (52.7%), mild LAE (31.6%), and moderate-severe LAE (15.7%). We used Cox proportional hazard models to calculate the hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association of LA size and LAE with recurrent cryptogenic/cardioembolic and total recurrent ischemic stroke.

Results

LA size was available in 529 (81%) patients. Mean age at enrollment was 69 ± 13 years; 45.8% were male, 54.0% Hispanic, and 18.5% had atrial fibrillation. Over a median of 4 years, there were 65 recurrent ischemic strokes (29 were cardioembolic or cryptogenic). In multivariable models adjusted for confounders, including atrial fibrillation and heart failure, moderate-severe LAE compared with normal LA size was associated with greater risk of recurrent cardioembolic/cryptogenic stroke (adjusted hazard ratio 2.83, 95% confidence interval 1.03–7.81), but not total ischemic stroke (adjusted hazard ratio 1.06, 95% confidence interval, 0.48–2.30). Mild LAE was not associated with recurrent stroke.

Conclusion

Moderate to severe LAE was an independent marker of recurrent cardioembolic or cryptogenic stroke in a multiethnic cohort of ischemic stroke patients. Further research is needed to determine whether anticoagulant use may reduce risk of recurrence in ischemic stroke patients with moderate to severe LAE.

### Indexed left atrial size predicts all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients undergoing aortic valve surgery [^117VC1DV]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

The enlargement of the left atrium has been identified as a marker of chronically increased left ventricular filling pressure and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. This study aims to evaluate the association of indexed left atrial diameter with stroke, cardiovascular mortality, the combined event, and all-cause mortality in patients who underwent aortic valve surgery.

Methods

Indexed left atrial diameter was measured in 2011 adult patients (mean age, 70.9 ± 10.8 years; 58.7% were men) who underwent aortic valve surgery between January 2008 and March 2016.

Results

On the basis of the criteria of the American Society of Echocardiography, indexed left atrial diameter was normal in 64% of patients, mildly enlarged in 12.4% of patients, moderately enlarged in 9.2% of patients, and severely enlarged in 14.3% of patients. Over a mean follow-up period of 3.2 ± 2.1 years, there were 334 deaths and 97 strokes. Cardiovascular mortality survival at 5 years among patients with normal, mild, moderate, and severe left atrial enlargement was 91.6%, 86.8%, 77.9%, and 77.4%, respectively (P < .001). After covariable adjustment, Cox regression analysis showed indexed left atrial diameter as an independent predictor of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio per 1-cm/m 2 increment, 1.545; 95% confidence interval, 1.252–1.906, P < .001), cardiovascular death (hazard ratio per 1-cm/m 2 increment, 1.971; 95% confidence interval, 1.541–2.520; P < .001), and the combined event (hazard ratio per 1-cm/m 2 increment, 1.673; 95% confidence interval, 1.321–2.119; P < .001).

Conclusions

Indexed left atrial diameter is a strong predictor of long-term outcomes in patients with aortic valve diseases who undergo surgery.

### Left atrial volume as an index of left atrial size: a population-based study [^113q42p5]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

We studied left atrial volume (LAV) as an index of atrial size.

Background

Increased left atrial dimension (LAD) measured by M-mode echocardiography is a risk factor for atrial fibrillation, stroke, and death.

Methods

A random sample of residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, age ≥ 45 years (n = 2,042) underwent Doppler echocardiography with assessment of LAD and LAV. A subgroup of the population (n = 767) with no cardiovascular disease and normal systolic and diastolic function was used to develop reference ranges for LAD and LAV. In the total population, the prevalence of left atrial enlargement and the association between cardiovascular disease and left atrial size as determined by both indexes were assessed.

Results

In the normal subgroup, both indexes were associated with gender and body size, thus models controlling for body size were used to determine gender-specific reference ranges for LAD and LAV. In the total population, left atrial enlargement was common, with a prevalence of 18% (men) and 12% (women) using LAD/body surface area (BSA) and of 16% (men and women) using LAV/BSA. The agreement between the indexes was only fair (kappa = 0.53). Adjusting for age and gender, LAV/BSA was more strongly associated with the presence of cardiovascular diseases than LAD/BSA.

Conclusions

We described a simple technique of measuring LAV, examined methods for indexing LAV, and described its normal range in a large, healthy reference cohort. Further, we find that in the community, left atrial enlargement is common and reflects the burden of cardiovascular disease.

### Novel technique for volume reduction of giant left atrium: simple and effective "spiral resection" method [^115B6dA8]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Despite some controversial studies, an enlarged left atrium has an impact on postoperative complications, and surgical correction should be considered, particularly in patients with a markedly enlarged left atrium. We present herein 2 patients with a giant left atrium (left atrial dimensions of 107 and 93 mm on echocardiograms), and describe an effective and simple procedure, the "spiral resection" method, to reduce any part of the dilated wall of the left atrium with a single incision.

### Diagnostic criteria for diastolic heart failure [^112tZ8Bd]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

A diagnosis of diastolic heart failure can be made if the patient exhibits clinical evidence of heart failure and has a normal left ventricular ejection fraction. The diagnosis is confirmed if there is evidence of ventricular hyperthrophy and/or concentric remodeling, left atrial enlargement, or laboratory evidence of diastolic dysfunction.

### Left atrial cardiomyopathy: a puzzling disease process short of an easy answer [^113Scgqc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

LA disease is likely determined by a multitude of factors, including age, traditional risk factors, social determinants of health, genetics, underlying arrhythmias, and cardiovascular disease (Figure 1). Besides understanding how to properly assess the LA, it will be important to unravel potential disease modifiers that may cause or worsen atrial cardiomyopathy and to find interventions able to improve LA function and reverse negative remodeling. Interestingly, the interventions characterized by a reduced calorie Mediterranean diet and physical activity that were evaluated in the PREDIMED‐Plus trial did not have an impact on the underlying structural and functional LA measurements in this study. In contrast, previous studies have demonstrated that weight loss, physical activity, and alcohol abstinence have positive effects on atrial electrical health by reducing AF recurrences. The LA substrate is also targeted directly with ablation (Figure 2). Although AF ablation consists primarily of pulmonary vein isolation, some studies have evaluated the impact of ablation outside of the pulmonary veins, aiming to modify regions of LA fibrosis. Widespread LA fibrosis, as detected by electroanatomic mapping, indicates advanced LA disease and has been associated with worse ablation outcomes. The recent ERASE‐AF (Low‐Voltage Myocardium‐Guided Ablation Trial of Persistent Atrial Fibrillation) trial demonstrated a benefit of targeting low‐voltage areas in the LA. In addition, in subanalyses from the CIRCA‐DOSE (Cryoballoon vs Irrigated Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation: Double Short vs Standard Exposure Duration) and the EARLY‐AF (Early Aggressive Invasive Intervention for Atrial Fibrillation) trials, ablation of paroxysmal AF was not only effective in reducing AF recurrence and burden, it also reduced progression to persistent AF, suggesting a protective effect on atrial health. Catheter ablation of AF has also been shown to lead to reverse remodeling or a reduction in LA volume and improvement in strain measurements. These observations make us hopeful that we may in fact be able to modify the extent and the progression of LA disease.

### Effects of year long aerobic exercise on left atrial size in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy [^1172RLQ3]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Habitual aerobic exercise is associated with left atrial (LA) enlargement which may increase risk of atrial fibrillation. Patients with LVH and increased LV stiffness may be more predisposed to LA remodeling due to higher LA pressures during exercise. We tested the hypothesis 1 year of aerobic exercise training would increase LA size to a greater extent in patients with LVH than controls. Adults with LVH (n = 53) enriched for increased cardiac risk and LV stiffness and control (CON) subjects (n = 58) were randomized to 1 year of high intensity aerobic exercise (ex) or yoga control. LA and LV volumes were measured using 3D echo. Of 111 participants, 83 had complete data available (LVH: 18 exercisers, 10 yoga; CON: 29 exercisers, 26 yoga). Baseline LA volume indices were similar between groups (LVH: 19.8 ± 4.4 mL/m 2 vs CON: 18.8 ± 4.1 mL/m 2; p = 0.33). After 1 year, the effects of exercise (p = 0.003) and LVH (p = 0.001) were each associated with increased LA volume index. More subjects in the LVH/exercise group (33.3%) increased LA size > 5 mL/m 2 and LA/LV volume ratios > 0.1 compared to the other groups (10% LVH/yoga, 3.4% CON/ex, 3.8% CON/yoga; Chi square p = 0.006). In conclusion, 1 year of aerobic training resulted in higher LA volumes in subjects with LVH and LV stiffness compared to healthy subjects. The increase in LA size was greater than changes in LV size suggesting chronic aerobic training in may preferentially affect LA remodeling in subjects with LVH and LV stiffness.

### Left atrial roof enlargement is a distinct feature of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^112gxC3b]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

It remains unknown to what extent intrinsic atrial cardiomyopathy or left ventricular diastolic dysfunction drive atrial remodeling and functional failure in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Computational 3-dimensional (3D) models fitted to cardiovascular magnetic resonance allow state-of-the-art anatomic and functional assessment, and we hypothesized to identify a phenotype linked to HFpEF.

Methods

Patients with exertional dyspnea and diastolic dysfunction on echocardiography (E/e', > 8) were prospectively recruited and classified as HFpEF or noncardiac dyspnea based on right heart catheterization. All patients underwent rest and exercise-stress right heart catheterization and cardiovascular magnetic resonance. Computational 3D anatomic left atrial (LA) models were generated based on short-axis cine sequences. A fully automated pipeline was developed to segment cardiovascular magnetic resonance images and build 3D statistical models of LA shape and find the 3D patterns discriminant between HFpEF and noncardiac dyspnea. In addition, atrial morphology and function were quantified by conventional volumetric analyses and deformation imaging. A clinical follow-up was conducted after 24 months for the evaluation of cardiovascular hospitalization.

Results

Beyond atrial size, the 3D LA models revealed roof dilation as the main feature found in masked HFpEF (diagnosed during exercise-stress only) preceding a pattern shift to overall atrial size in overt HFpEF (diagnosed at rest). Characteristics of the 3D model were integrated into the LA HFpEF shape score, a biomarker to characterize the gradual remodeling between noncardiac dyspnea and HFpEF. The LA HFpEF shape score was able to discriminate HFpEF (n = 34) to noncardiac dyspnea (n = 34; area under the curve, 0.81) and was associated with a risk for atrial fibrillation occurrence (hazard ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 1.01–1.04]; P = 0.003), as well as cardiovascular hospitalization (hazard ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 1.00–1.04]; P = 0.043).

Conclusions

LA roof dilation is an early remodeling pattern in masked HFpEF advancing to overall LA enlargement in overt HFpEF. These distinct features predict the occurrence of atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular hospitalization.

### Electrocardiographic diagnosis of left atrial enlargement… [^113eaGH2]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

- Established scalar electrocardiographic criteria for left atrial enlargement are based on abnormalities of the P-terminal force, total P-wave duration, and the relationship of total P-wave duration to PR-interval duration. These electrocardiographic signs may also result from left atrial hypertension, left atrial hypertrophy, and interatrial conduction defects. This article describes the scalar electrocardiographic criteria for left atrial enlargement in current use, and provides a critical appraisal of their efficacy in diagnosis. Alpert MA, Munuswamy K. Electrocardiographic Diagnosis of Left Atrial Enlargement. Arch Intern Med. 1989; 149: 1161–1165.

### Precordial heave on the right related to left-atrial enlargement… [^1112PSep]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The precordial heave associated with mitral-valve lesions, and usually attributed to right-ventricular hypertrophy, is most marked in the left parasternal region. When right-ventricular hypertrophy is due to congenital lesions, the peak forward movement shifts from the neighborhood of the sternum to the left precordial area. It is suggested that in the presence of mitral-valve lesions, enlargement of the left atrium forces the right ventricle toward the sternum and thus significantly influences the development and site of the precordial heave.

### Left atrium size and the risk of cardiovascular death in middle-aged men… [^1125fn5a]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

The excess risk for cardiovascular mortality appeared to reside largely in the highest tertile of LA size. After additional adjustment for LV mass, the relation between LA size and mortality did not remain statistically significant in this group. Conclusions This prospective population-based study shows that echocardiographically defined LA diameter was directly related to the risk of cardiovascular death. The association of LA enlargement to cardiovascular death appears to be partially related to LV hypertrophy. The adjusted risk for cardiovascular death were 1. 23-fold for each 5-mm increment in LA diameter and

1. 60-fold was divided by height, a 1-U increment in this variable was related to a 1. 11-fold risk for cardiovascular death, after adjustment for other risk factors and the use of antihypertensive medications. Consistent with our findings, the relation of LA enlargement to death may be partially mediated by increased LV mass. 9, 11. However, our main objective was to provide an additional simple prognostic marker that may enhance the usefulness of echocardiography for risk stratification in a population, although this study does not show if subjects with LA enlargement should be treated more aggressively, as patients with hypertension, LV hypertrophy, or diabetes are normally treated. Our prospective study suggests that the easily obtainable LA diameter measurement can be used as a prognostic marker when instruments to measure mitral or pulmonary vein velocity or any other new technologies are not available.

This study provides evidence that LA size is a noninvasive parameter that improves risk stratification for fatal cardiovascular events in a population-based cohort, and the relation of LA enlargement to death appears to be partially mediated by LV mass. Left atrium size is a nontraditional clinical risk stratifier, but it may be a more important measure in preclinical CVDs.

### Mitral value surgery and left heart catheterization in giant left atrium… [^115yJegy]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The finding of a giant left atrium is commonly considered as evidence of predominant mitral regurgitation. * As such, this would contraindicate mitral stenosis surgery. However, in a series of 153 left heart catheterizations we have encountered 14 such patients. In five patients mitral stenosis was the dominant or sole lesion, and surgery was performed in these cases, with confirmation of the preoperative diagnosis. The frequent recording of severe vibratory pressure fluctuations in the left atrium in these patients is of interest in a consideration of the nature of massive left atrial enlargement. Procedures All 14 patients with giant left atrium had a careful history, physical examination, roentgenographic and fluoroscopic evaluation of heart size and chamber enlargement, electrocardiogram, urinalysis, complete blood cell count, and appropriate blood chemistry tests.

Transthoracic left heart catheterization was done in the prone position, with intermittent fluoroscopic observation for guidance of needle insertion into the left atrium.
