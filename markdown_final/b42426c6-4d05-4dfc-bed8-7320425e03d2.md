## Question

metronidazol dose for colitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the metronidazole dose for colitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what type of colitis is being treated because dosing depends on the underlying cause. Then, I should clarify adult versus pediatric dosing and the route of administration. Next, I will confirm current guideline positions because metronidazole is no longer first-line for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), which is the most common infectious colitis context where metronidazole might still be considered. Finally, I need to check safety limits, monitoring, and scenarios where IV metronidazole is used as adjunctive therapy in severe disease [^113RZaKD] [^111pwDqz] [^115Gkeox].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context: "colitis" is broad, but modern recommendations addressing metronidazole dosing overwhelmingly pertain to CDI-associated colitis. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — metronidazole is no longer preferred for initial CDI in adults; fidaxomicin or vancomycin is recommended first. Metronidazole is reserved as an alternative in non-severe CDI when first-line agents are unavailable or not feasible, so I need to ensure the question maps to CDI and not to IBD flare, ischemic colitis, or other etiologies where metronidazole is not standard therapy for colitis per se [^113RZaKD] [^111pwDqz] [^117X1dF1].

> For adults with an initial non-severe CDI episode, I should verify the alternative regimen: the recommended metronidazole dose is 500 mg orally three times daily for 10 days, but only when fidaxomicin or vancomycin are unavailable or not feasible. Wait, I need to check duration — guidelines and labeling constrain therapy to around 10 days and discourage prolonged or repeated courses. If the patient is not improving clinically within about 3–5 days, I should reassess and switch to vancomycin or fidaxomicin rather than extending metronidazole, given inferior outcomes and safety concerns [^113RZaKD] [^111pwDqz] [^115Gkeox].

> Now, for severe-complicated or fulminant CDI, let me think about IV therapy: high-dose oral vancomycin is the backbone, and IV metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hours is commonly added when there is ileus or impaired oral delivery. Wait, let me verify guidance nuances — IDSA/SHEA and surgical guidelines endorse adjunctive IV metronidazole with fulminant disease or ileus, whereas ESCMID 2021 cautions against routine addition and suggests adjunctive IV metronidazole can be considered selectively. So, combination therapy is appropriate in fulminant disease with ileus, but I should avoid adding IV metronidazole routinely in severe disease without ileus and base the decision on illness severity and drug delivery considerations [^114rZuQd] [^117F9Hxo] [^111rQAjZ] [^111e1coc] [^112twzqy].

> For pediatrics, I should double-check the weight-based dosing and preferred agents. In children with non-severe CDI, metronidazole 7.5 mg/kg per dose given three or four times daily (max 500 mg/dose) is an option when vancomycin is not available, whereas for severe disease, oral vancomycin 10 mg/kg/dose QID is preferred. Let me verify monitoring — children not improving by about day 5 should be re-evaluated for other causes or switch in therapy, consistent with pediatric updates. Also, I need to ensure we acknowledge the contemporary shift toward vancomycin or fidaxomicin as preferred first-line therapies in many pediatric settings as data accumulate [^117D5HQh] [^112wJqRR] [^112L9jjm] [^112rMjAm].

> But wait, why is metronidazole de-emphasized? I will now examine comparative efficacy data. Vancomycin is superior to metronidazole in severe CDI in randomized trials, and fidaxomicin reduces recurrence compared with vancomycin. Moreover, metronidazole is associated with slower decline in stool shedding and environmental contamination versus fidaxomicin and vancomycin, which may have infection control implications. These findings underpin the shift to fidaxomicin or vancomycin as first-line and relegate metronidazole to an alternative role in non-severe disease only when needed [^1166rfTe] [^114xSRBU] [^116TH1G5] [^1136xbnm] [^111pwDqz].

> Next, I should review resistance trends that further erode metronidazole's utility. Let me verify the mechanism — recent work shows a heme-dependent metronidazole resistance phenotype driven by constitutive nimB expression due to a promoter mutation, often co-occurring with fluoroquinolone resistance in epidemic strains. This mechanistic and epidemiologic signal aligns with clinical observations of declining efficacy in some lineages, reinforcing why guidelines have moved away from metronidazole as first-line therapy [^116ozr81] [^111u1T3a] [^112nviS9].

> Safety is critical; I need to ensure duration limits and risk mitigation are explicit. Repeated or prolonged courses of metronidazole should be avoided because of cumulative neurotoxicity risk, including encephalopathy and peripheral neuropathy. I should double-check special populations — dose reduction is recommended in severe hepatic impairment, and typical adult daily totals should not exceed labeling maxima. Hmm, wait a minute — I initially thought pregnancy was a contraindication and to "avoid" metronidazole, but let me verify; the provided labeling excerpt does not list pregnancy as a formal contraindication, so I will correct myself and refrain from stating pregnancy avoidance here, focusing instead on efficacy-based preference for vancomycin or fidaxomicin in adults with CDI rather than safety-based prohibition of metronidazole in pregnancy in this answer [^113RZaKD] [^116SK1fd] [^112yJoyy] [^1177LzKC].

> I should clarify non-CDI colitis scenarios. Metronidazole does not have a standard, guideline-endorsed "colitis" dose for ulcerative colitis, ischemic colitis, or non-CDI etiologies; therapy should be directed at the underlying cause rather than defaulting to metronidazole. Hold on, I should verify the IBD overlap — when CDI complicates IBD, vancomycin is preferred over metronidazole for CDI management. Let me also note a potential pitfall: an SPL excerpt lists a metronidazole dose for Crohn's disease, but without supportive guideline context, I should not generalize this as "colitis dosing"; I will flag it as nonstandard for CDI-related colitis dosing decisions [^1127Ywfj] [^111LsNPa] [^111kGBmA].

> Putting this together for adult CDI when metronidazole is necessary: 500 mg orally three times daily for 10 days for an initial non-severe episode when fidaxomicin or vancomycin are unavailable or impractical, with reassessment by day 3–5 and prompt switch if not improving. For fulminant disease or ileus, add IV metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hours to high-dose oral or rectal vancomycin, recognizing that ESCMID discourages routine IV metronidazole addition absent ileus. Limit total exposure to 10–14 days and avoid repeated or prolonged courses to minimize neurotoxicity risk [^113RZaKD] [^111pwDqz] [^117F9Hxo] [^114rZuQd] [^111e1coc] [^112twzqy].

> For pediatric CDI when metronidazole is used, I should confirm the specifics: 7.5 mg/kg per dose orally three or four times daily (maximum 500 mg/dose) for non-severe disease if vancomycin is unavailable, with vancomycin 10 mg/kg/dose QID preferred in severe disease. I need to ensure follow-up plans are clear — re-evaluate at around day 5 if symptoms persist, and consider switching to vancomycin or fidaxomicin per evolving pediatric evidence and availability [^117D5HQh] [^112wJqRR] [^112rMjAm] [^112L9jjm].

> Final answer to the dosing question, stated plainly but keeping the caveats: for adults with Clostridioides difficile colitis, metronidazole 500 mg orally three times daily for 10 days is an alternative only when fidaxomicin or vancomycin are unavailable; in fulminant disease with ileus, add metronidazole 500 mg IV every 8 hours to high-dose oral or rectal vancomycin. For children with non-severe CDI, metronidazole 7.5 mg/kg per dose TID to QID (maximum 500 mg/dose) may be used if vancomycin is not available, with vancomycin preferred in severe disease. I should emphasize again to avoid prolonged or repeated metronidazole courses, monitor closely for clinical response within 3–5 days, and switch promptly if not improving [^113RZaKD] [^111pwDqz] [^117F9Hxo] [^117D5HQh] [^116SK1fd].

Metronidazole is no longer first-line for colitis [^113RZaKD] due to declining efficacy and resistance [^111u1T3a]; use **500 mg PO TID for 10 days** only if vancomycin or fidaxomicin are unavailable or contraindicated [^115Gkeox]. For fulminant colitis with ileus [^114rZuQd], add **IV metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hours** [^111e1coc] to oral/rectal vancomycin [^111rQAjZ]. Avoid repeated or prolonged courses [^116SK1fd] due to neurotoxicity risk [^113RZaKD] [^112yJoyy].

## Recommended metronidazole dosing regimens

### Non-severe colitis

Dose: **500 mg orally three times daily (TID) for 10 days** [^113RZaKD] [^115Gkeox]. Indication: Use only [^113RZaKD] if **vancomycin or fidaxomicin** [^111pwDqz] are unavailable or contraindicated [^115Gkeox].

---

### Severe or fulminant colitis

Dose: **500 mg intravenously** [^114rZuQd] every 8 hours (q8h) [^111e1coc]. Indication: Add to **oral or rectal vancomycin** [^114rZuQd] when **ileus** [^111e1coc] or severe disease limits oral absorption [^117F9Hxo].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting current dosing recommendations

Recent evidence shows that **metronidazole is inferior to vancomycin** [^1166rfTe] and **fidaxomicin** [^114xSRBU], with higher failure and recurrence rates [^114Sg48u], which supports its use only when first-line agents are unavailable [^113RZaKD] [^115Gkeox].

---

## Limitations and risks associated with metronidazole therapy

Regarding **neurotoxicity**, there is a risk of cumulative, potentially irreversible neurotoxicity [^113RZaKD] — including encephalopathy [^112yJoyy] — with repeated or prolonged use [^116SK1fd]. For **resistance**, emerging resistance [^111u1T3a] reduces efficacy [^113RZaKD] and increases recurrence.

---

## Alternative antibiotic therapies

**Vancomycin**: 125 mg orally four times daily (QID) for 10 days [^111pwDqz]; preferred first-line for non-severe and severe colitis [^114bsveu]. **Fidaxomicin**: 200 mg orally twice daily (BID) for 10 days [^1136xbnm]; preferred for initial and recurrent episodes [^115DgiMm] due to lower recurrence rates [^114xSRBU].

### Current state of Clostridium difficile treatment options [^1155oKcB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Metronidazole has been widely used as a first-line treatment of CDI in the United States since 1994, following recommendations from the Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These recommendations cautioned against the use of oral vancomycin due to concerns about potential resistance in enterococci. Although metronidazole remains effective for treating mild to moderate CDI, recent reports have indicated increased failure rates and slower symptom resolution. Furthermore, oral metronidazole was found to be inferior to vancomycin for severe CDI treatment in two recent randomized comparative trials, though no significant difference was found in another trial. The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA)/Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines provide interim recommendations for assessing severity based on white blood cell count and serum creatinine level, but a validated severity score is still needed. Metronidazole is highly absorbed, resulting in negligible fecal concentrations in asymptomatic C. difficile carriers and only modest levels in patients with diarrhea. As a result, metronidazole is not the ideal treatment for an infection that is limited to the colon. Nonetheless, due to its effectiveness in mild to moderate CDI and its relative affordability, oral metronidazole remains widely used.

Nitazoxanide is a thiazolide compound that has been studied for its efficacy in treating CDI.

### Risk of Clostridium difficile infection in hospitalized patients receiving metronidazole for a non-C difficile infection [^116RSA3N]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Antibiotics often are given to prevent infections but also constitute a risk factor for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Metronidazole is an effective treatment for CDI. We investigated whether prophylactic administration of metronidazole to patients before they receive other antibiotics reduces the risk of CDI.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of data collected from 12,026 high-risk patients admitted to Cleveland Clinic Foundation Hospitals from 2008 through 2012. High-risk patients were defined as age 55 or older who received a broad-spectrum antibiotic (piperacillin-tazobactam or ciprofloxacin) and a gastric acid suppressant (a proton pump inhibitor or a histamine-2 receptor blocker) during their hospitalization. Development of CDI was compared between patients who received metronidazole for non-CDI indications before broad-spectrum antibiotics (n = 811) and those who did not (n = 11,215). Logistic regression was used to control for patient demographics and comorbidities.

- **Results**: The rate of CDI was 1.4% (n = 11) among the patients who received metronidazole for non-CDI indications and 6.5% (n = 728) among those who did not. This was observed to be an 80% reduction in CDI among patients who received metronidazole (odds ratio, 0.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.11–0.38; P < .001), adjusted for age, sex, and comorbidities.

- **Conclusions**: Based on a retrospective analysis, metronidazole might be used to prevent CDI in certain high-risk patients. Prospective controlled trials are necessary before making further recommendations.

### Treatment of first recurrence of Clostridium difficile infection: Fidaxomicin versus vancomycin [^116KHeWb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) with either metronidazole or vancomycin is associated with recurrence in 20%–30% of patients. Recurrence of the disease is frustrating because there is no approved treatment alternative that provides a lower probability of yet another recurrence. Following a second recurrence, subsequent episodes occur in as many as 40%–60% of patients. ReCDI may be a consequence of resident spores or infection from local environmental contamination, making relapse and reinfection difficult to distinguish. Both metronidazole and vancomycin suppress the growth of the normal microflora and thereby defeat natural colonization resistance. The purported success of fecal transplantation in the treatment of relapsing CDI supports the importance of preserving normal flora to prevent reinfection.

Guidelines suggest treating a first episode of nonsevere uncomplicated CDI with oral metronidazole 500 mg three times daily for 10–14 days. Oral vancomycin 125 mg four times daily for 10–14 days has become the standard for treating severe CDI. Treatment of the first recurrence of CDI is usually conducted with the same regimen used to treat the initial episode, whereas tapered and/or pulsed doses of vancomycin are recommended for second and subsequent recurrences. Long-term treatment with metronidazole has been associated with cumulative neurotoxicity and is not recommended beyond the first recurrence.

Fidaxomicin is highly active against Gram-positive anaerobes and spares Bacteroides species that normally comprise a major constituent of the gut flora.

### Treatment of Clostridium difficile-associated disease [^115EdJNc]. Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection is an increasing burden on the health care system, totaling more than $1 billion per year in the United States. Treatment of patients with C. difficile infection using metronidazole or vancomycin has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality; however, the number of patients not responding to metronidazole is increasing. Despite initial response rates of greater than 90%, 15% to 30% of patients experience a relapse in symptoms after successful initial therapy, usually in the first few weeks after treatment is discontinued. Failure to develop a specific antibody response has recently been identified as a critical factor in recurrence. This review discusses the different management strategies for initial and recurrent symptomatic C. difficile infections.

### Impact of oral metronidazole, vancomycin, and fidaxomicin on host shedding and environmental contamination with Clostridioides difficile [^116TH1G5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Shedding of Clostridioides difficile spores from infected individuals contaminates the hospital environment and contributes to infection transmission. We assessed whether antibiotic selection affects C. difficile shedding and contamination of the hospital environment.

- **Methods**: In this prospective, unblinded, randomized controlled trial of hospitalized adults with C. difficile infection, patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive fidaxomicin, oral vancomycin, or metronidazole. The primary outcome was change in environmental contamination rate during treatment. Secondary outcomes included stool shedding, total burden of contamination, and molecular relatedness of stool versus environmental C. difficile isolates.

- **Results**: Of 33 patients enrolled, 31 (94%) completed the study. Fidaxomicin (-0.36 log10 colony-forming units [CFUs]/d [95% confidence interval (CI), -0.52 to -0.19]; p < 0.01) and vancomycin (-0.17 log10 CFUs/d [-0.34 to -0.01]; p = 0.05) were associated with more rapid decline in C. difficile shedding than metronidazole (-0.01 log10 CFUs/d [95% CI, -0.10 to 0.08]). Both vancomycin (6.3% [95% CI, 4.7–8.3]) and fidaxomicin (13.1% [10.7–15.9]) were associated with lower rates of environmental contamination than metronidazole (21.4% [18.0–25.2]). With specific modeling of within-subject change over time, fidaxomicin (adjusted odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.70–0.99]; p = 0.04) was associated with more rapid decline in environmental contamination than vancomycin or metronidazole. Overall, 207 of 233 environmental C. difficile isolates (88.8%) matched patient stool isolates by ribotyping.

### Evolution of clinical guidelines for antimicrobial management of infection [^117XzcL8]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Treatment of primary C. difficile infection: For a patient with an initial episode of CDI, we recommend fidaxomicin instead of a standard course of vancomycin. Treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection: In patients with recurrent C. difficile infection, we recommend fidaxomicin (either standard or extended pulse) rather than a standard course of vancomycin. Prevention of recurrence of C. difficile infection: For patients with CDI and at least one risk factor for recurrence (e.g. age > 65, immunocompromise, severe CDI, and history of CDI), we suggest using bezlotoxumab in addition to the standard of care antimicrobial.

These updates to the IDSA/SHEA 2017 guideline further acknowledge the issue that was highlighted in the study by Ma et al. showing a significant increase in multiply recurrent CDI. By treating more aggressively earlier in the disease with fidaxomicin preferentially, there should be less recurrence and better outcomes. This is a remarkable advancement with regards to the recommendations, since fidaxomicin was recommended provisionally in front of vancomycin for both initial and recurrent disease. There have been a number of studies that support this, but the two primary studies are referenced here. The first is a multi-center European study of inpatients with CDI who were randomized to receive either vancomycin 125 mg PO QID for 10 days or fidaxomicin 200 mg twice per day (BID) for 5 days and then one tablet every other day for days 7–25. The study showed that vancomycin and fidaxomicin are similar in terms of initial treatment response, but follow up at 90 days…

### Decoding a cryptic mechanism of metronidazole resistance among globally disseminated fluoroquinolone-resistant Clostridioides difficile [^116ozr81]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Severe outbreaks and deaths have been linked to the emergence and global spread of fluoroquinolone-resistant Clostridioides difficile over the past two decades. At the same time, metronidazole, a nitro-containing antibiotic, has shown decreasing clinical efficacy in treating C. difficile infection (CDI). Most metronidazole-resistant C. difficile exhibit an unusual resistance phenotype that can only be detected in susceptibility tests using molecularly intact heme. Here, we describe the mechanism underlying this trait.

We find that most metronidazole-resistant C. difficile strains carry a T-to-G mutation (which we term PnimB G) in the promoter of the gene nimB, resulting in constitutive transcription. Silencing or deleting nimB eliminates metronidazole resistance. NimB is related to Nim proteins that are known to confer resistance to nitroimidazoles. We show that NimB is a heme-dependent flavin enzyme that degrades nitroimidazoles to amines lacking antimicrobial activity. Furthermore, occurrence of the PnimB G mutation is associated with a Thr82Ile substitution in DNA gyrase that confers fluoroquinolone resistance in epidemic strains. Our findings suggest that the pandemic of fluoroquinolone-resistant C. difficile occurring over the past few decades has also been characterized by widespread resistance to metronidazole.

### Clostridioides difficile infection in children: Recent updates on epidemiology, diagnosis, therapy [^112L9jjm]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile is the most important infectious cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea worldwide and a leading cause of healthcare-associated infection in the United States. The incidence of C. difficile infection (CDI) in children has increased, with 20,000 cases now reported annually, also posing indirect educational and economic consequences. In contrast to infection in adults, CDI in children is more frequently community-associated, accounting for three-quarters of all cases. A wide spectrum of disease severity, ranging from asymptomatic carriage to severe diarrhea, can occur, varying by age. Fulminant disease, although rare in children, is associated with high morbidity and even fatality.

Diagnosis of CDI can be challenging, as currently available tests detect either the presence of the organism or disease-causing toxin but cannot distinguish colonization from infection. Since colonization can be high in specific pediatric groups, such as infants and young children, biomarkers to aid in accurate diagnosis are urgently needed. Similar to the disease in adults, recurrence of CDI in children is common, affecting 20% to 30% of incident cases.

Metronidazole has long been considered the mainstay therapy for CDI in children. However, new evidence supports the safety and efficacy of oral vancomycin and fidaxomicin as additional treatment options, whereas fecal microbiota transplantation is gaining popularity for reinfection. Recent advancements in our understanding of emerging epidemiologic trends and management of CDI unique to children are highlighted.

### Plasmid-mediated metronidazole resistance in Clostridioides difficile [^115V8K7x]. Nature Communications (2020). Low credibility.

Clostridioides difficile (Clostridium difficile) is a Gram-positive obligate anaerobe capable of causing Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) upon disruption of the normal intestinal microbiota. Although it is one of the major causes of nosocomial infectious diarrhea, community-acquired CDI is becoming more frequent. CDI infection poses a significant economic burden, with an estimated cost of €3 billion per year in the European Union, and impairs the quality of life in infected individuals.

The incidence of CDI has increased over the last two decades with outbreaks caused by epidemic types such as PCR ribotype (RT) 027 (NAP1/BI). CDI is not restricted to this type, however, as infections caused by RT001, RT002, RT014/020, and RT078 are frequently reported in both Europe and the United States.

Metronidazole is used for the treatment of mild-to-moderate infections, and vancomycin is used for severe infections, though vancomycin is increasingly indicated as a general first-line treatment. Fidaxomicin has recently also been approved for CDI treatment, but its use is limited by high costs. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is effective at treating recurrent CDI (rCDI) that is refractory to antimicrobial therapy.

Reduced susceptibility and resistance to clinically used antimicrobials, including metronidazole, have been reported. This, combined with the intrinsic multiple drug-resistant nature of C. difficile, stresses the importance of the development of better diagnostics and new effective treatment modalities.

### Clostridium difficile infection: A review of current and emerging therapies [^116p4RYa]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Although the efficacy of metronidazole is declining, it remains the initial therapy for the majority of patients who have mild-to-moderate infection and is the treatment of choice for the first recurrence of CDI. Vancomycin continues to be recommended as initial therapy for severe CDI. Early surgical consultation is required in the event of severe complicated CDI.

The treatment of multiple recurrences of CDI is challenging. The use of FMT presents an enormous breakthrough as a therapy for recurrent CDI; however, multicenter RCTs with long-term follow-up are essential to assess the efficacy and safety of FMT.

There are many novel treatment strategies emerging involving the use of non-antibiotics, which appear promising. These strategies provide optimistic approaches to future therapy. However, there is limited knowledge about the safety and efficacy of these treatments. Further research should be conducted to enable these treatment modalities to be widely accepted.

### Advances in the medical treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection [^111r1xjw]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2025). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile medical management has changed significantly over the past decade with an emphasis on preventing reinfection. This review compares guidelines on the treatment of initial, recurrent, fulminant, and pediatric C. difficile infection (CDI) and evaluates the mechanisms and clinical use of available antibiotics for CDI. C. difficile has complex resistance mechanisms to vancomycin, fidaxomicin, and metronidazole, which may play a role in treatment outcomes. Antibiotics such as tigecycline and rifaximin, as well as monoclonal antibodies against toxin B, may be useful in adjunctive therapy. Additional therapies under development include new narrow therapeutic antibiotics.

### Clostridioides difficile infection in children: Recent updates on epidemiology, diagnosis, therapy [^112rMjAm]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

The management of CDI is determined by the number and severity of episodes. Children who do not respond to targeted treatment within 5 days should be re-evaluated for other causes. There is currently insufficient evidence to support probiotics as an alternative to antimicrobial therapy for CDI treatment.

- **First episode**: For symptomatic children, initial management should include discontinuation of the inciting antibiotic, when possible, to limit further intestinal microbial disruption. Antimicrobial therapies targeted against the initial CDI episode of mild or moderate severity include oral metronidazole and oral vancomycin. Metronidazole, which has been a mainstay treatment of pediatric CDI, was removed as a recommended first-line choice for adults in the 2017 IDSA and SHEA guidelines. Vancomycin and fidaxomicin are now recommended as preferred first-line therapies in adults based on improved clinical cure rates and lower recurrence risk. High-quality data to support treatment guideline recommendations in children were lacking at the time; however, post-guideline shifts in prescribing practice with decreased use of metronidazole and increased use of oral vancomycin in children with CDI have been observed.

A retrospective, comparative effectiveness study of 192 children hospitalized with nonsevere CDI has since shown that those treated with vancomycin had earlier resolution of symptoms (86.3%) compared with those treated with metronidazole (71.1%) by day 5.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a common cause of diarrhea in both inpatient and outpatient settings. In recent years, there have been significant changes in the treatment spectrum of CDI. Notably, recommendations now advise against using metronidazole for initial CDI. Additionally, fidaxomicin and bezlotoxumab have been added to the treatment options, and there is an emergence of microbial replacement therapies.

Several other therapies are undergoing clinical trials. This narrative review focuses on the treatment of CDI, summarizing literature on newer modalities and the treatment guidelines issued by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

### Current state of Clostridium difficile treatment options [^116ouNVd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Ten to 20 years ago, there was little interest in developing new treatment agents for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) because CDI in most patients responded to metronidazole or vancomycin therapy. The disease was common but more easily managed, and severe complicated cases of CDI were infrequent. During the past decade, the epidemiology and clinical picture of CDI have changed dramatically, and the limitations of treatment options have become more apparent. Before the approval of fidaxomicin earlier this year, oral vancomycin was the only agent approved for the treatment of CDI in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration.

- **Limitations of other treatments**: Multiple dosing requirements, cost, relative efficacy, risk for recurrence, development of resistance, and adverse reactions limit other treatment options.

Here, we review the currently available CDI treatment agents with emphasis on their limitations and the general approach to managing recurrent CDI and severe complicated CDI.

### Decoding a cryptic mechanism of metronidazole resistance among globally disseminated fluoroquinolone-resistant Clostridioides difficile [^111u1T3a]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Over the last two decades, the global spread of epidemic C. difficile has been paralleled by declining efficacy of metronidazole, culminating in major guidelines removing it as a recommended first-line option for CDI. We recently demonstrated that heme-dependent resistance to metronidazole, defined by an MIC breakpoint of ≥ 1 µg/mL, was associated with an increased risk of metronidazole clinical failure. Fundamental to this finding was the revelation that heme is crucial for detecting metronidazole-resistant C. difficile. Our findings that most metronidazole-resistant strains evolved a T to G mutation (P nimB G) in the -10 promoter of C. difficile nimB provide a microbial genetic explanation as to why such strains might be less responsive to metronidazole therapy.

Additionally, the fact that P nimB G co-occurs with the Thr82Ile substitution in GyrA updates the paradigm for the global dissemination of epidemic strains, suggesting that CDI outbreaks were mediated by strains with resistance not only to fluoroquinolones but also to metronidazole. These dual drug resistances likely afforded epidemic C. difficile an advantage in healthcare settings. Multiple lines of evidence support P nimB G as a cause of widespread metronidazole resistance, including our GWAS using two independent methodologies, a previously published GWAS of independent samples, our documentation of the mutation emerging in vivo in a metronidazole-treated patient, and its mechanistic genetic validation.

### Safety and efficacy of fidaxomicin in the treatment of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea [^115Cwcvs]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) is the most common cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea. The recommended treatment regimens of metronidazole and vancomycin have not changed in nearly 25 years. Fidaxomicin, an exceedingly narrow-spectrum macrolide antibiotic, was recently approved for the treatment of CDAD. In phase III clinical trials, fidaxomicin was noninferior to vancomycin in achieving a clinical cure of CDAD. Furthermore, fidaxomicin was associated with fewer recurrences of CDAD compared with vancomycin in clinical trials. These results, combined with the ease of administration and a good safety profile, make fidaxomicin an attractive treatment option for treating CDAD.

### Intravenous metronidazole for the treatment of Clostridium difficile colitis [^116ceJqe]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2001). Low credibility.

Severe Clostridium difficile colitis may produce abdominal distention and ileus, precluding oral antibiotic therapy. Stimulated by several case reports in which intravenous metronidazole was used, we reviewed our experience.

- **Methods**: Using pharmacy and microbiology laboratory records, we retrospectively identified patients with C. difficile colitis who received intravenous metronidazole as initial monotherapy. To be included, patients had to fulfill the following criteria: 1) at least six doses (equivalent to two days of therapy) of intravenous metronidazole were administered, 2) no other potential cause for colitis was found, and 3) the diagnosis of C. difficile colitis was firmly established. For eligible patients, five clinical parameters were assessed before and after intravenous metronidazole.

- **Results**: Our patient group (n = 10) received an average of 13.7 (range, 6–24) doses of intravenous metronidazole as initial therapy for C. difficile colitis. All received a dose of 500 mg three times daily. The majority of patients with vomiting, fever, and/or abdominal pain present at the beginning of therapy had resolution with intravenous metronidazole. Only one patient developed a symptom (vomiting) while on therapy; however, this eventually resolved when oral metronidazole was instituted. No patient required colectomy for refractory colitis or developed toxic megacolon. No patient, including those on prolonged courses, developed toxicity related to intravenous metronidazole such as peripheral neuropathy.

- **Conclusions**: Intravenous metronidazole may be effective.

### Diagnosis and treatments [^115w4AKC]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

Clostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium) is a major cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea and is increasingly present in the community. Historically, C. difficile infection was considered easy to diagnose and treat. Over the past two decades, however, diagnostic techniques have evolved in line with a greater understanding of the physiopathology of C. difficile infection and the use of new therapeutic molecules. This evolution revealed significant under- and misdiagnosis of C. difficile infection, emphasizing the importance of algorithms recommended by European and North American infectious diseases societies to obtain a reliable diagnosis.

Previously, metronidazole was considered the reference drug to treat C. difficile infection. More recently, however, vancomycin and other newer drugs have shown higher cure rates. Recurrence of infection is a key parameter in the evaluation of new drugs, and the challenge is to target the right population with the appropriate therapeutic molecule. In multiple recurrences, fecal microbiota transplantation is recommended. New approaches, including antibodies, vaccines, and new molecules, are already available or in the pipeline, but more data are needed to support their inclusion in practice guidelines. This review aims to provide a baseline for clinicians to understand and stratify their choices in the diagnosis and treatment of C. difficile infection based on the most recent data available.

### Metronidazole [^1177LzKC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Dosage and administration involve individualization based on the indication for use, the patient's age, weight, clinical condition, and concomitant treatment, and on the patient's clinical and laboratory response to the treatment.

- **Recommended dosage for the treatment of anaerobic bacterial infections**: The recommended dosage schedule for adults for the treatment of anaerobic infections is as follows. Parenteral therapy may be transitioned to oral metronidazole therapy depending on the severity of the disease and the patient's response to metronidazole injection. The usual adult oral dosage is 7.5 mg/kg every six hours, approximately 500 mg for a 70-kg adult. A maximum of 4 grams should not be exceeded within a 24-hour period. The typical duration of therapy is 7 to 10 days; however, infections of the bone and joint, lower respiratory tract, and endocardium may require longer treatment.

- **Recommended dosage for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections in pediatric patients less than 4 months of age**: The recommended dosage schedule for pediatric patients less than 4 months of age for treating intra-abdominal infections achieves drug exposures similar to those in adults treated with metronidazole injection for this indication.

- **Recommended dosage in patients with severe hepatic impairment**: For patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), the metronidazole dose should be reduced to prevent accumulation.

### What is the role for metronidazole in the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection? Results from a national cohort study of veterans with initial mild disease [^116Ukd4w]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Metronidazole may still be an appropriate therapeutic option for mild Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in select patients, but data are limited to guide clinicians in identifying these patients.

- **Methods**: Our two-stage study included a national cohort of veterans with a first episode of mild CDI (2010–2014). First, among those treated with metronidazole, we identified predictors of success, defined as absence of all-cause mortality or recurrence 30 days posttreatment, using multivariable unconditional logistic regression. Second, among a subgroup of patients with characteristics predictive of success identified in the first stage, we compared clinical outcomes among those treated with metronidazole compared with vancomycin, using Cox proportional hazards models for time to 30-day all-cause mortality, CDI recurrence, and failure.

- **Results**: Among 3,656 patients treated with metronidazole, we identified 3,282 patients with success and 374 patients without success (failure). Younger age was the only independent predictor of success. Age ≤ 65 years was associated with an odds of success 1.63 times higher (95% confidence interval, 1.29–2.06) than age > 65 years. Among 115 propensity score-matched pairs ≤ 65 years of age, no significant differences were observed between metronidazole and vancomycin (reference) for all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.29 [95% CI, .06–1.38]), CDI recurrence (HR, 0.62 [95% CI, .26–1.49]), or failure (HR, 0.50 [95% CI, .23–1.07]).

- **Conclusions**: Among patients ≤ 65 years of age with initial mild CDI, clinical outcomes were similar with both treatment options.

### Antibiotic treatment for Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea in adults [^11315R6N]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile is recognized as a frequent cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis.

- **Objectives**: The aim of this review is to investigate the efficacy of antibiotic therapy for C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD).

- **Search strategy**: MEDLINE (1966 to March 24, 2010), EMBASE (1980 to March 24, 2010), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane IBD/FBD Review Group Specialized Trials Register were searched using the following search terms: "pseudomembranous colitis and randomized trial"; "Clostridium difficile and randomized trial"; "antibiotic associated diarrhea and randomized trial".

- **Selection criteria**: Only randomized, controlled trials assessing antibiotic treatment for CDAD were included in the review. The following outcomes were sought: initial resolution of diarrhea; initial conversion of stool to cytotoxin and/or culture negative; recurrence of diarrhea; recurrence of fecal evidence of CDAD; patient response to cessation of prior antibiotic therapy; emergent surgery; and death.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three authors independently assessed abstracts and full-text articles for inclusion. The risk of bias was independently rated by two authors. For dichotomous outcomes, relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were derived from each study and summary statistics obtained when appropriate, using a fixed effects model, except where significant heterogeneity was detected, at which time a random effects model was used.

- **Main results**: Fifteen studies (total of 1152 participants) with CDAD were included.

### Clostridium difficile infection: a review of current and emerging therapies [^113WadQL]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The choice of antibiotic therapy should be tailored to the severity of disease presentation.

- **Mild-to-moderate disease**: The antibiotics metronidazole or vancomycin have been the initial treatment options for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). The recommended regimen is oral metronidazole 500 mg t.i.d. for 10–14 days. The use of intravenous metronidazole at a dose of 500 mg t.i.d. can also be used for treatment of CDI in lieu of oral therapy. Oral vancomycin 125 mg q.i.d. for 10–14 days can be used alternatively for non-severe CDI. Vancomycin is usually preferred in patients who are intolerant/allergic to metronidazole, pregnant, and nursing mothers. Failure to respond to metronidazole therapy within 5–7 days requires a change in therapy to a standard dose of vancomycin (125 mg orally q.i.d.).

- **Treating severe or complicated CDI**: Prompt initiation of oral vancomycin, 125 mg q.i.d. for severely ill patients is critical. Some clinicians favor a higher dosing of vancomycin, 500 mg q.i.d. for severe disease. Vancomycin may also be administered rectally as a retention enema in the setting of ileus, megacolon, and colonic diversion. Intravenous metronidazole is added as adjunctive therapy for ileus or severe/complicated CDI, typically with vancomycin when administered orally, or as a retention enema. The use of fidaxomicin (200 mg orally b.i.d.) is a reasonable alternative in patients with severe disease with less clinical response to oral vancomycin.

### Prospective, randomized inpatient study of oral metronidazole versus oral metronidazole and rifampin for treatment of primary episode of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea [^115udTUt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, no randomized trial to address the use of adjunctive rifampin in addition to metronidazole for the treatment of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea has been reported. Rifampin has excellent in vitro activity against C. difficile and penetrates into cellular materials where the organisms may persist.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective, randomized, single-blinded study of 39 patients that compared therapy with metronidazole alone versus therapy with metronidazole and rifampin for 10 days to treat laboratory-confirmed primary episode of C. difficile-associated diarrhea. Twenty patients were randomly assigned to the metronidazole group, and 19 were randomly assigned to the metronidazole and rifampin group. Data were analyzed by intention-to-treat analysis using the 2-tailed Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test.

- **Results**: Adjunctive rifampin treatment for 10 days, compared with treatment with metronidazole alone for 10 days, was associated with a similar median time to symptom improvement (9.0 days vs. 6.5 days; p = 0.74), a similar median time to first relapse (26 days vs. 16 days; p = 0.23), a similar proportion of patients with relapse by study day 40 (42% vs. 38%; P = 1.0), and a similar proportion of patients experiencing nonfatal adverse events (37% vs. 40%; p = 0.55). There were a significantly higher number of deaths in the metronidazole and rifampin group, compared with the metronidazole group (6 of 19 patients vs. 1 of 20 patients; p = 0.04), but there were fewer laboratory-confirmed relapses by study day 40 (2 vs. 4; p = 0.66).

### Diagnosis and management of Clostridioides difficile infection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^114hN2Ei]. Current opinion in gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) may complicate the course of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The clinical presentation of CDI in this population is often atypical, and patients may experience exacerbations of their underlying inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) secondary to C. difficile. This review seeks to examine the risk factors, diagnosis, and management of CDI within the context of IBD.

- **Recent findings**: Patients with colonic involvement of their IBD are at higher risk for CDI, and colonization may be more common than in the general population. CDI is confirmed using a two-step approach to stool testing. Oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin are the preferred agents for non-fulminant disease, with oral metronidazole no longer recommended as first-line therapy. For all patients with CDI recurrence, fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) should be considered, as it has been shown to be safe and effective. Among those who experience worsening of their underlying IBD, retrospective research suggests improved outcomes for those who undergo escalation of immunosuppression with appropriate antimicrobial treatment of C. difficile; however, prospective data are needed.

- **Summary**: CDI may complicate the course of IBD, though its presentation may not be typical. Therefore, all patients with worsening gastrointestinal symptoms should be evaluated for both CDI and IBD exacerbation. Providers should consider FMT for all patients with recurrent CDI, as well as the escalation of immunosuppression for patients who fail to improve with appropriate antimicrobial treatment.

### Relatively poor outcome after treatment of Clostridium difficile colitis with metronidazole [^1128kbBe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile is a frequent cause of serious nosocomial infection. Earlier reports have suggested that treatment with metronidazole cured nearly 90% of patients, with only a modest rate of recurrence of infection. In recent years, the rate of response to treatment with this drug has appeared to be much lower.

- **Methods**: We undertook a prospective, observational study of 207 patients who were treated with metronidazole for C. difficile colitis.

- **Results**: A total of 103 patients (50%) were cured by the initial course of therapy and had no recurrence of disease. Forty-six patients (22%) continued to have symptoms of colitis for ≥ 10 days despite treatment, and 58 (28%) responded initially but had a recurrence within the ensuing 90 days. The mortality rate among patients who developed C. difficile colitis was 27%, and it was higher among patients who did not respond fully to an initial course of therapy compared with those who did (33% vs. 21%; P < .05).

- **Conclusions**: Because of the relatively poor response to therapy, additional approaches to prevention and/or treatment of C. difficile colitis appear to be warranted.

### Management of colitis: Insights for the gastroenterologist [^1144tDst]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Prior to the year 2000, two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) found similar cure rates for metronidazole and vancomycin for treating CDI. However, these were small trials with fewer than 50 patients in each arm. More recently, three RCTs, with a total of 687 patients, found vancomycin to be superior to metronidazole in terms of cure rates. The two RCTs, with a total of 1105 patients comparing fidaxomicin with vancomycin, found similar cure rates for both drugs but with lower recurrence rates in patients treated with fidaxomicin.

On the basis of these studies, the IDSA/SHEA 2017 guideline recommends vancomycin [125 mg four times daily (QID) per oral (PO) for 10 days] or fidaxomicin [200 mg twice daily (BID) PO for 10 days] for the first mild-to-moderate/severe episode of CDI. Metronidazole [500 mg three times daily (TID) for 10 days] is recommended for the initial mild-to-moderate episode only if the first-line drugs are not available. This was a change from the previous guideline, wherein metronidazole (for mild-to-moderate) and vancomycin (for severe) were recommended for the first episode of CDI. The evidence supporting these recommendations is of high quality, leading to a strong recommendation for all regimens except metronidazole, which has a weak recommendation.

The 2014 ESCMID guidelines recommend several options for the initial non-severe episode. These include metronidazole (500 mg TID for 10 days; class IA recommendation), vancomycin (125 mg QID for 10 days; class IB recommendation), and fidaxomicin (200 mg BID for 10 days; class IB recommendation).

### Does addition of intravenous metronidazole to oral vancomycin improve outcomes in Clostridioides difficile infection [^114agLJN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend adding intravenous (IV) metronidazole to oral vancomycin for fulminant Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). In this study, we compared the dual therapy of IV metronidazole and vancomycin versus vancomycin monotherapy and assessed prevalence and effectiveness in nonfulminant and fulminant CDI.

- **Methods**: This was a 2-center retrospective study conducted from 2010 to 2018. Adult inpatients were included if they had a positive C. difficile polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performed on an unformed stool and received vancomycin within 2 days of testing. Patients were classified as having received dual therapy if IV metronidazole was given within the same time window; otherwise, they were classified as vancomycin monotherapy. The primary outcome was death or colectomy within 90 days after the index test. Logistic regression modeling was used to adjust for CDI severity and other established predictors of CDI outcomes. CDI recurrence was examined as a secondary outcome, adjusting for death as a competing risk.

- **Results**: The study included 2114 patients (dual therapy, 993; monotherapy, 1121); 23% met the primary outcome. There was no association between dual therapy and the primary outcome (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.07; 95% confidence interval, .79–1.45), which remained true when the analysis was restricted to patients with fulminant CDI (aOR, 1.17; 95% CI, .65–2.10). There was also no association between dual therapy and CDI recurrence.

- **Conclusions**: Dual therapy with IV metronidazole and vancomycin was common for nonfulminant and fulminant CDI; however, it did not improve outcomes as measured by death or colectomy rates.

### Clostridioides difficile infections; new treatments and future perspectives [^111hwoKq]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

And newly approved Clostridioides difficile infection treatments

The vegetative bacteria can be successfully eliminated with antimicrobial therapy; however, the spores are highly resilient and can persist in the gut. The treatment of initial CDI with antimicrobial therapy can cause further disruptions to the microbiota, exacerbating the intestinal dysbiosis and potentially leading to the relapse of symptoms, known as CDI recurrence. CDI recurrence is defined as the onset of symptoms within 8 weeks of clinical cure from a previous episode and can occur in up to 20% of patients, with increasing frequency with each subsequent episode. This highlights the need to combine antimicrobial regimes with microbiota-restorative therapies to re-establish colonization resistance of the commensal microbiota and reduce the likelihood of recurrence.

In line with guidelines, CDI treatment options include fidaxomicin, vancomycin, and metronidazole. Fidaxomicin is a narrow-spectrum antibiotic that demonstrates superior preservation of the intestinal microbiota when compared to vancomycin and is associated with similar clinical cure rates and a lower risk of CDI recurrence. Fidaxomicin standard therapy (200 mg, 12 hourly for 10 days) is recommended as the first choice for the treatment of the initial episode of nonsevere CDI, severe CDI, and severe-complicated/refractory CDI. If fidaxomicin is not available, standard vancomycin therapy (125 mg, 6 hourly for 10 days) can be used as an alternative. Metronidazole is no longer recommended as a first-line agent to treat CDI.

### Nitazoxanide for the treatment of Clostridium difficile colitis [^1137DPhp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile colitis has increased in incidence and severity, with documented treatment failure using metronidazole therapy. It is uncertain whether vancomycin is more effective than metronidazole. However, concerns over vancomycin resistance have prompted the search for alternative therapies. Nitazoxanide, a nitrothiazolide, blocks anaerobic metabolism in eukaryocytes and is effective against intestinal infestations due to Cryptosporidium or Giardia species. At low concentrations, nitazoxanide inhibits C. difficile in vitro.

- **Methods**: We designed a prospective, randomized, double-blind study to compare nitazoxanide to metronidazole in treating hospitalized patients with C. difficile colitis.

- **Results**: Thirty-four patients received metronidazole at a dosage of 250 mg four times daily for 10 days, while 40 patients received nitazoxanide at a dosage of 500 mg twice daily for 7 days, and 36 patients received nitazoxanide at a dosage of 500 mg twice daily for 10 days. After 7 days of treatment, 28 (82.4%) of 34 patients had responded to metronidazole therapy compared with 68 (89.5%) of 76 patients who received nitazoxanide therapy (difference, 7.1%; 95% confidence interval, -7.1% to 25.5%). Thirty-one days after beginning treatment, sustained responses were observed in 19 (57.6%) of 33 patients who received metronidazole therapy for 10 days, compared with 25 (65.8%) of 38 patients who received nitazoxanide for 7 days and 26 (74.3%) of 35 patients who received nitazoxanide for 10 days (P = 0.34).

- **Conclusion**: Nitazoxanide shows promise as an alternative therapy for C. difficile colitis, yet further investigation is warranted to validate these findings.

### New and emerging therapies in treatment of Clostridium difficile infection [^113kvCuU]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) represents one of the most serious nosocomial infections that have grown dramatically over the past decade. Vancomycin and metronidazole are currently used as standard therapy for CDI. Metronidazole is recommended as a first-line therapy for mild-to-moderate infections, while vancomycin is mainly used for severe and/or refractory cases. However, studies have demonstrated quite high CDI relapse rates with both of these medications, which represents a challenge for clinicians. Over the last decade, newer and novel therapeutic options have emerged as promising alternatives to these standard CDI therapies. This review provides updated summaries of these newer therapeutic agents and their status in the treatment of CDI.

### Fidaxomicin versus vancomycin for Clostridium difficile infection [^114xSRBU]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection is a serious diarrheal illness associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Patients generally respond to oral vancomycin or metronidazole; however, the rate of recurrence is high. This phase 3 clinical trial compared the efficacy and safety of fidaxomicin with those of vancomycin in treating C. difficile infection.

- **Methods**: Adults with acute symptoms of C. difficile infection and a positive result on a stool toxin test were eligible for study entry. We randomly assigned patients to receive fidaxomicin (200 mg twice daily) or vancomycin (125 mg four times daily) orally for 10 days. The primary endpoint was clinical cure, defined as the resolution of symptoms and no need for further therapy for C. difficile infection as of the second day after the end of the course of therapy. The secondary endpoints were recurrence of C. difficile infection (diarrhea and a positive result on a stool toxin test within 4 weeks after treatment) and global cure (i.e. cure with no recurrence).

- **Results**: A total of 629 patients were enrolled, of whom 548 (87.1%) could be evaluated for the per-protocol analysis. The rates of clinical cure with fidaxomicin were noninferior to those with vancomycin in both the modified intention-to-treat analysis (88.2% with fidaxomicin and 85.8% with vancomycin) and the per-protocol analysis (92.1% and 89.8%, respectively). Significantly fewer patients in the fidaxomicin group than in the vancomycin group had a recurrence of the infection in both the modified intention-to-treat analysis (15.4% vs. 25.3%, P = 0.005).

### Clostridioides difficile infection: Update on management [^115WwQeP]. American Family Physician (2020). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection have recently been updated. Risk factors include recent exposure to health care facilities or antibiotics, especially clindamycin. C. difficile infection is characterized by a wide range of symptoms, ranging from mild or moderate diarrhea to severe disease with pseudomembranous colitis, colonic ileus, toxic megacolon, sepsis, or death. C. difficile infection should be considered in patients who are not taking laxatives and have three or more episodes of unexplained, unformed stools in 24 hours. Testing in these patients should start with enzyme immunoassays for glutamate dehydrogenase and toxins A and B, or nucleic acid amplification testing.

In children older than 12 months, testing is recommended only for those with prolonged diarrhea and risk factors. Treatment depends on whether the episode is an initial versus a reinfection, and on the severity of the infection based on white blood cell count, serum creatinine level, and other clinical signs and symptoms. For an initial episode of non-severe C. difficile infection, oral vancomycin or oral fidaxomicin is recommended. Metronidazole is no longer recommended as first-line therapy for adults. Fecal microbiota transplantation is a reasonable treatment option with high cure rates in patients who have had multiple recurrences and have received appropriate antibiotic therapy for at least three of the episodes. Good antibiotic stewardship is a key strategy to decrease rates of C. difficile infection.

In routine or endemic settings, hands should be cleaned properly to prevent the spread of infection.

### Antibiotic treatment for Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea in adults [^116ehXA7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is recognized as a frequent cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis.

- **Objectives**: The aim of this review is to establish the efficacy of antibiotic therapy for C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), to identify the most effective antibiotic treatment for CDAD in adults, and to determine the need for stopping the causative antibiotic during therapy.

- **Search strategy**: MEDLINE (1966 to 2006), EMBASE (1980 to 2006), Cochrane Central Database of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane IBD Review Group Specialized Trials Register were searched using the following search terms: "pseudomembranous colitis and randomized trial"; "Clostridium difficile and randomized trial"; "antibiotic associated diarrhea and randomized trial".

- **Selection criteria**: Only randomized, controlled trials assessing antibiotic treatment for CDAD were included in the review. Probiotic trials are excluded. The following outcomes were sought: initial resolution of diarrhea; initial conversion of stool to C. difficile cytotoxin and/or stool culture negative; recurrence of diarrhea; recurrence of fecal C. difficile cytotoxin and/or positive stool culture; patient response to cessation of prior antibiotic therapy; sepsis; emergent surgery (fecal diversion or colectomy); and death.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data were analyzed using the MetaView statistical package in Review Manager. For dichotomous outcomes, relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were derived from each study. When appropriate, the results of included studies were combined.

### Comparative effectiveness of vancomycin and metronidazole for the prevention of recurrence and death in patients with Clostridium difficile infection [^113FYCt1]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Metronidazole hydrochloride has historically been considered first-line therapy for patients with mild to moderate Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) but is inferior to vancomycin hydrochloride for clinical cure. The choice of therapy may likewise have substantial consequences on other downstream outcomes, such as recurrence and mortality, although these secondary outcomes have been less studied.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the risk of recurrence and all-cause 30-day mortality among patients receiving metronidazole or vancomycin for the treatment of mild to moderate and severe CDI.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This retrospective, propensity-matched cohort study evaluated patients treated for CDI, defined as a positive laboratory test result for the presence of C. difficile toxins or toxin genes in a stool sample, in the US Department of Veterans Affairs health care system from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2012. Data analysis was performed from February 7, 2015, through November 22, 2016.

- **Exposures**: Treatment with vancomycin or metronidazole.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The outcomes of interest in this study were CDI recurrence and all-cause 30-day mortality. Recurrence was defined as a second positive laboratory test result within 8 weeks of the initial CDI diagnosis. All-cause 30-day mortality was defined as death from any cause within 30 days of the initial CDI diagnosis.

- **Results**: A total of 47,471 patients (mean [SD] age, 68.8 [13.3] years; 1,947 women [4.1%] and 45,524 men [95.9%]) developed CDI and were treated with vancomycin or metronidazole.

### A comparison of vancomycin and metronidazole for the treatment of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, stratified by disease severity [^1166rfTe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). High credibility.

This study, titled "Vancomycin vs. Metronidazole for C. Difficile Colitis", was published by Zar FA and colleagues in 2007 in the journal *Clinical Infectious Diseases.* It focuses on Clostridioides difficile infection. The trial investigates the effect of vancomycin in patients with C. difficile-associated diarrhea, using a single-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. A total of 150 patients participated, comprising 68 females and 82 males.

The inclusion criteria involved patients with C. difficile-associated diarrhea, stratified by mild or severe disease based on clinical criteria. Key exclusion criteria included perforated viscus or bowel obstruction, prior failure to respond to either study drug, pregnancy, history of allergy to either drug, or treatment with oral vancomycin or parenteral or oral metronidazole during the previous 14 days.

- **Interventions**:
	- Vancomycin (125 mg QID PO for 10 days; n = 71)
	- Metronidazole (250 mg QID PO for 10 days; n = 79)

- **Primary outcome**:
	- Significant increase in cure rate with vancomycin (97% vs. 84%; RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.97)

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- No significant details provided on the secondary outcomes.

This study contributes valuable insights into the treatment efficacy of vancomycin compared to metronidazole in patients with C. difficile-associated diarrhea.

### A prospective study of risk factors and historical trends in metronidazole failure for Clostridium difficile infection [^111rXXMP]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Recent studies of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) have indicated a dramatic increase in metronidazole failure. The aims of this study were to compare historical rates of metronidazole failure and to identify risk factors for metronidazole failure.

Eighty-nine patients with CDI in 2004 to 2006 were followed for 60 days and were compared with a historical cohort of 63 CDI patients studied prospectively in 1998. Metronidazole failure was defined as persistent diarrhea after 10 days of therapy or a change of therapy to vancomycin. Stool samples were analyzed for the presence of the North American pulsed-field gel electrophoresis type-1 (NAP-1) strain.

Metronidazole failure rates were 35% in both cohorts. There was no difference in the median time to resolution of diarrhea (8 vs. 5 days; p = 0.52) or the proportion with more than 10 days of diarrhea (35% vs. 29%; p = 0.51). Risk factors for metronidazole failure included recent cephalosporin use (odds ratio [OR], 32; 95% confidence interval, 5–219), CDI on admission (OR, 23; 95% CI, 3–156), and transfer from another hospital (OR, 11; 95% CI, 2–72). The frequency of NAP-1 infection in patients with and without metronidazole failure was similar (26% vs. 21%; p = 0.67).

We found no difference in metronidazole failure rates in 1998 and 2004 to 2006. Patients with recent cephalosporin use, CDI on admission, and transfer from another hospital were more likely to experience metronidazole failure. Infection with the epidemic NAP-1 strain was not associated with metronidazole failure.

### ACG clinical guidelines: Prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections [^115rzSJH]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection occurs when the bacterium produces a toxin that causes diarrhea and inflammation of the colon. These guidelines indicate the preferred approach to the management of adults with C. difficile infection and represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology. The scientific evidence for these guidelines was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process. In instances where the evidence was not appropriate for Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation but there was consensus of significant clinical merit, key concept statements were developed using expert consensus. These guidelines are meant to be broadly applicable and should be viewed as the preferred, but not the only, approach to clinical scenarios.

### Economic burden and cost-effectiveness of therapies for infection: a narrative review [^115NNgJp]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) still recommends the use of metronidazole (500 mg orally three times per day for 10 days) for mild CDI, with a switchover to vancomycin in the case of non-improvement of symptoms, whereas for severe disease, oral vancomycin (± intravenous metronidazole) is preferred. Fidaxomicin, although equivalent to vancomycin, is more expensive. For recurrences of CDI, the ACG suggests the use of a pulsed regimen of vancomycin and reports FMT to be the most effective treatment.

Per European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Disease guidelines, the main antibiotics that are recommended are metronidazole (500 mg orally three times per day for 10 days for mild/moderate CDI), vancomycin (125 mg or 500 mg orally four times per day for 10 days), and fidaxomicin (200 mg twice daily for 10 days). Fecal transplantation is strongly recommended for multiple recurrent CDI. In the case of perforation of the colon and/or systemic inflammation and deteriorating clinical condition despite antibiotic therapy, total abdominal colectomy or diverting loop ileostomy combined with colonic lavage is recommended.

### Treatment of Clostridium difficile infections [^111AbvjT]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Vancomycin and metronidazole were historically considered equivalent therapies for the management of Clostridium difficile infections (CDI); however, recent data confirm more favorable outcomes with vancomycin. Fidaxomicin is a narrow-spectrum antibiotic that has an advantage in reducing recurrence rates compared with vancomycin, possibly owing to its sparing effect on normal colonic microbiota. Data are limited for guiding management of CDI recurrences, particularly multiple recurrences. Several empiric approaches to manage these cases are reviewed.

### A comparison of vancomycin and metronidazole for the treatment of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, stratified by disease severity [^113JGJTv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The incidence and severity of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) have been increasing. There have been recent reports of metronidazole treatment failure. Metronidazole is still commonly used as first-line treatment for CDAD but has never been compared with vancomycin in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. We conducted such a trial, stratifying patients according to disease severity, to investigate whether one agent was superior for treating either mild or severe disease.

- **Methods**: From October 1994 through June 2002, patients with CDAD were stratified according to whether they had mild or severe disease based on clinical criteria. They were randomly assigned to receive oral metronidazole (250 mg 4 times per day) or oral vancomycin (125 mg 4 times per day) for 10 days. Both groups received an oral placebo in addition to the study drug. Patients were followed up for 21 days to assess cure, treatment failure, relapse, or intolerance.

- **Results**: One hundred seventy-two patients were enrolled, and 150 of these patients successfully completed the trial. Among the patients with mild CDAD, treatment with metronidazole or vancomycin resulted in clinical cure in 90% and 98% of the patients, respectively (P = 0.36). Among the patients with severe CDAD, treatment with metronidazole or vancomycin resulted in clinical cure in 76% and 97% of the patients, respectively (P = 0.02). Clinical symptoms recurred in 15% of the patients treated with metronidazole and 14% of those treated with vancomycin.

### The effect of antibiotic therapy for Clostridioides difficile infection on mortality and other patient-relevant outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111AaDp8]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). High credibility.

Practice guidelines favor fidaxomicin over vancomycin and exclude metronidazole from the recommended standard regimen for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), based on lower recurrence rates with fidaxomicin, giving little weight to mortality or the clinical implications of recurrences.

- **Objectives**: To compile the effects of metronidazole, glycopeptides (vancomycin or teicoplanin), and fidaxomicin for CDI on mortality and other patient-relevant outcomes.

- **Data sources**: PubMed, the Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, conference proceedings, and Google Scholar, until August 2023.

- **Study eligibility criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

- **Participants**: Adult patients experiencing primary or recurrent CDI.

- **Interventions**: Glycopeptides versus fidaxomicin or metronidazole (comparators).

- **Assessment of risk of bias**: We used the Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool for randomized trials, focusing on the outcome of all-cause mortality.

- **Methods of data synthesis**: Random effects meta-analyses were performed for dichotomous outcomes. Outcomes were summarized preferentially for all randomly assigned patients.

Results from thirteen trials were included. There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR] < 1 favoring the comparator) between vancomycin and fidaxomicin (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64–1.14, 8 RCTs, 1951 patients) or metronidazole (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.46–1.32, 4 RCTs, 808 patients), with low and very low certainty of evidence, respectively. No significant difference in initial treatment failure between fidaxomicin and vancomycin was found.

Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is recognized as a frequent cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and colitis. This review is an update of a previously published Cochrane review.

- **Objectives**: The aim of this review is to investigate the efficacy and safety of antibiotic therapy for C. difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD), or C. difficile infection (CDI), which are synonymous terms.

- **Search methods**: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Trials Register from inception to 26 January 2017. Additionally, we searched clinicaltrials.gov and clinicaltrialsregister.eu for ongoing trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Only randomized controlled trials assessing antibiotic treatment for CDI were included in the review.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three authors independently assessed abstracts and full-text articles for inclusion and extracted data. The risk of bias was independently rated by two authors. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). We pooled data using a fixed-effect model, except where significant heterogeneity was detected, at which time a random-effects model was used. The following outcomes were sought: sustained symptomatic cure (defined as initial symptomatic response and no recurrence of CDI), sustained bacteriologic cure, adverse reactions to the intervention, death, and cost.

- **Main results**: Twenty-two studies (3215 participants) were included. The majority of studies enrolled patients with mild to moderate CDI who could tolerate oral antibiotics.

### Comparative effectiveness of Clostridium difficile treatments: A systematic review [^1137xv6m]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection is increasing in incidence and severity, and the optimal treatment remains unknown.

- **Purpose**: To determine whether, among adults with C. difficile infection, treatment with certain antibiotics compared with others results in differences in initial cure, recurrence, and harms.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE, AMED, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane databases (search dates: inception through August 2011, limited to English-language reports), as well as a bibliography review.

- **Study selection**: Randomized, controlled trials of adults with C. difficile infection, independent of outcomes, who were treated with medications available in the United States. Observational studies reporting strain were included.

- **Data extraction**: Study design, inclusion and exclusion criteria, quality and strength of evidence as assessed by two reviewers, study definitions, and duration of treatment and follow-up. Outcomes included initial cure, recurrence, and treatment harms.

- **Data synthesis**: Eleven trials that included 1,463 participants were identified. Three trials compared metronidazole with vancomycin; eight compared metronidazole or vancomycin with another agent, combined agents, or placebo. Strain was analyzed in one trial and two cohort studies. No study comparing two antimicrobial agents demonstrated a statistically significant difference for initial cure; all comparisons were of low to moderate strength of evidence. Moderate-strength evidence from one study demonstrated that recurrence was decreased with fidaxomicin versus vancomycin (15% vs. 25%; difference, -10 percentage points [95% CI, -17 to…).
