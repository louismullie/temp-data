## Question

Omega 3 fatty acids coronary Heart disease

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether omega-3 fatty acids reduce coronary heart disease risk and how to interpret the mixed evidence for clinical decision-making. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the types of omega-3s and the distinction between dietary intake and supplementation. Then, I should appraise the highest-quality randomized evidence, including the JAMA Cardiology meta-analysis and contemporary large RCTs. Next, I will examine dose, formulation, and population effects, especially EPA versus EPA+DHA and statin-era cohorts. After that, I should review guideline positions and reconcile them with mechanistic and biomarker data. Finally, I will translate this into practical, risk-stratified recommendations and highlight uncertainties and safety issues like atrial fibrillation and bleeding risk.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and definitions. Omega-3 fatty acids include marine-derived EPA and DHA and plant-derived ALA; most clinical outcome data focus on EPA and DHA, and ALA conversion to EPA/DHA in humans is limited, so direct intake of EPA/DHA is typically required for clinically relevant tissue levels and effects, which I should keep in mind as I interpret trials and guidelines [^3d72d9aa] [^7f1dad27].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality aggregate RCT evidence. The 2018 JAMA Cardiology meta-analysis of 10 large RCTs with 77,917 high-risk individuals found no significant reduction in fatal CHD, nonfatal MI, or major vascular events with omega-3 supplementation, and this null result persisted across subgroups including those with prior CHD, diabetes, and statin users, which is a pivotal anchor for modern practice [^00aef5bf] [^2076834c].

> Wait, let me verify the contemporary RCT landscape beyond that meta-analysis. STRENGTH, testing 4 g/day of EPA+DHA carboxylic acid versus corn oil in statin-treated, high-risk patients, was terminated early for futility and showed no reduction in MACE, reinforcing the lack of benefit for mixed EPA+DHA formulations in this setting [^f0d4b33a]. By contrast, REDUCE-IT, using 4 g/day of icosapent ethyl (EPA only) on a statin background in patients with triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL and high-risk features, demonstrated a 25% relative risk reduction in MACE and a 20% reduction in cardiovascular death, suggesting a formulation-specific and dose-dependent effect rather than a class effect [^61e89ecf] [^1145b4cd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about EPA alone versus EPA+DHA. Multiple meta-analyses indicate that EPA monotherapy shows larger and more consistent reductions in cardiovascular outcomes than EPA+DHA combinations, with pooled estimates around 20–30% for EPA versus smaller, often nonsignificant effects for mixed formulations, which aligns with the divergent results of REDUCE-IT versus STRENGTH and other EPA+DHA trials [^d873a9f9] [^cf0e59a8] [^3b2eeb1b].

> I need to check dose and population considerations. Observational and biomarker studies consistently associate higher circulating EPA+DHA with lower fatal CHD risk, but translating this into RCT benefit has been challenging; benefits appear more plausible at higher doses (around 1.8–4 g/day of EPA) and in higher-risk, often hypertriglyceridemic, statin-treated patients, whereas low-dose OTC supplements (about 1 g/day) have not shown clear outcome benefits in modern RCTs, which helps explain the discrepancy between older positive trials and newer null results [^5092686c] [^991b6e6a] [^017f3bd7].

> Let me consider guideline positions carefully. The 2023 AHA/ACC/ACCP chronic coronary disease guideline advises against adding nonprescription omega-3 supplements to reduce cardiovascular events, reflecting the largely null modern RCT evidence base, while acknowledging that prescription EPA (icosapent ethyl) has a role in selected high-risk, hypertriglyceridemic patients on statins based on REDUCE-IT [^0c526353] [^8151e083]. Earlier AHA guidance supported 1 g/day EPA+DHA for secondary prevention, but that recommendation predates the most recent null meta-analyses and is not reflected in the 2023 update, so I should not over-interpret older endorsements in light of current evidence [^017f3bd7].

> I should double-check mechanistic plausibility to ensure I'm not missing a biologic signal. EPA and DHA have triglyceride-lowering effects, anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving mediator actions, membrane-stabilizing properties, and potential antiarrhythmic and antithrombotic effects; however, these mechanisms have not consistently translated into hard outcomes in mixed-formulation, low-dose, or contemporary statin-era populations, which tempers enthusiasm outside the specific EPA-high-dose, high-risk context [^99f48ebc] [^1145b4cd] [^3d72d9aa].

> But wait, what about safety signals that could offset benefits. Higher-dose omega-3s, particularly EPA, are associated with increased atrial fibrillation and bleeding events in some trials, so I need to weigh these risks against potential benefits in shared decision-making, especially in older adults or those with AF risk factors or on antithrombotics [^d873a9f9] [^61e89ecf].

> Let me translate this into practical recommendations, and I should confirm I'm aligning with the strength of evidence. For primary prevention, routine omega-3 supplementation is not supported; dietary intake of 1–2 servings/week of fatty fish is reasonable for overall cardiovascular health, but supplements should not be recommended to prevent CHD events [^d7d54522] [^774ac382]. For secondary prevention or high-risk patients with triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL on statins, prescription icosapent ethyl 4 g/day is reasonable given robust MACE and CV death reductions in REDUCE-IT, with counseling about AF and bleeding risks and attention to drug–drug interactions [^61e89ecf] [^1145b4cd]. For patients with triglycerides < 150 mg/dL or those already on high-intensity statins with well-controlled LDL-C, the incremental benefit of omega-3s is uncertain, and mixed EPA+DHA formulations have not shown consistent outcome benefits in this setting, so I should avoid routine use outside of approved indications [^f0d4b33a] [^0c526353].

> I should confirm the bottom line and ensure internal consistency. The totality of modern RCT evidence shows no clinically meaningful benefit for low-dose, mixed EPA+DHA supplements in primary or secondary prevention, whereas high-dose EPA monotherapy (icosapent ethyl) confers significant cardiovascular risk reduction in selected high-risk, hypertriglyceridemic patients on statins; thus, any recommendation must be formulation-, dose-, and population-specific, and routine OTC omega-3 use for CHD prevention is not supported by current high-quality evidence [^00aef5bf] [^61e89ecf] [^d873a9f9].

Omega-3 fatty acids have **modest cardiovascular benefits** in coronary heart disease (CHD): they lower triglycerides [^4f61e004] and may reduce fatal CHD and sudden cardiac death [^5092686c], especially in secondary prevention [^4f61e004] and high-risk patients [^d873a9f9]. However, **recent large RCTs and meta-analyses** show no significant reduction in all-cause or cardiovascular mortality [^4f61e004] in primary prevention, and mixed results in secondary prevention [^00aef5bf] [^f0d4b33a]. Prescription EPA (icosapent ethyl) at 4 g/day [^61e89ecf] reduces events in high-risk, hypertriglyceridemic patients on statins [^1145b4cd], but this is not generalizable to OTC supplements. Routine omega-3 supplementation is **not recommended** for primary or secondary prevention [^0c526353]; dietary intake of 1–2 servings/week of fatty fish is reasonable [^d7d54522], and prescription EPA may be considered for selected high-risk patients with elevated triglycerides [^61e89ecf].

---

## Mechanisms of omega-3 fatty acids in CHD

Omega-3 fatty acids exert **pleiotropic effects** that may influence CHD risk:

- **Triglyceride lowering**: EPA and DHA reduce hepatic triglyceride synthesis and increase clearance, lowering triglycerides by ~20–30% [^e31ba97f] [^4f61e004].

- **Anti-inflammatory effects**: Omega-3s reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines and promote resolution of inflammation [^99f48ebc].

- **Antiarrhythmic properties**: Omega-3s stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes, potentially reducing sudden cardiac death [^66057921].

- **Antithrombotic effects**: Omega-3s reduce platelet aggregation and thromboxane A2 production [^e31ba97f].

---

## Evidence from clinical trials and meta-analyses

### Primary prevention

In primary prevention, **VITAL** (1 g/day EPA+DHA) showed no significant reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) but did reduce total myocardial infarction by 28% and percutaneous coronary intervention by 22% [^774ac382]. The **Cochrane 2018 meta-analysis** found little or no effect of omega-3 supplementation on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, or cardiovascular events in primary prevention [^11f073b0].

---

### Secondary prevention

In secondary prevention, **GISSI-Prevenzione** (1 g/day EPA+DHA) reduced cardiovascular mortality by 20% and sudden cardiac death by 45% in post-MI patients [^notfound]. The **JELIS trial** (1.8 g/day EPA) reduced major coronary events by 19% in hypercholesterolemic patients on statins [^99f48ebc]. However, **more recent trials** (e.g. STRENGTH, OMEMI) [^f0d4b33a] found no significant reduction in MACE with EPA+DHA supplementation in statin-treated patients [^f59002a1].

---

### Meta-analyses

Meta-analyses show **modest benefits** in secondary prevention: a 2018 Cochrane review found a slight reduction in CHD mortality and events with marine omega-3s, largely driven by older trials [^4f61e004]. A 2021 meta-analysis reported reductions in cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal MI, and CHD events, with greater effects for EPA monotherapy than EPA+DHA combinations [^d873a9f9] [^cf0e59a8].

---

## Dose and formulation considerations

- **Low-dose supplementation** (1 g/day EPA+DHA) shows minimal benefit in contemporary statin-treated populations [^00aef5bf].

- **High-dose EPA** (4 g/day icosapent ethyl) [^1145b4cd] significantly reduces cardiovascular events in high-risk, hypertriglyceridemic patients on statins (REDUCE-IT) [^61e89ecf].

- **EPA vs DHA**: EPA appears to drive cardiovascular benefit, whereas DHA may offset some of EPA's effects [^d873a9f9] [^6c1e14bb].

---

## Safety considerations

Omega-3s are generally safe, but **high-dose EPA** increases atrial fibrillation risk [^d873a9f9] and bleeding risk, especially with anticoagulants [^d873a9f9]. Gastrointestinal side effects are common at higher doses [^f0d4b33a].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Current guidelines reflect the **limited benefit** of omega-3s in CHD:

- **AHA/ACC 2023**: Do not recommend routine omega-3 supplementation for primary or secondary prevention [^0c526353] [^8151e083].

- **AHA 2017**: Consider omega-3s for secondary prevention in patients with recent CHD events or heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, but evidence is modest [^017f3bd7].

- **ESC 2021**: Recommend icosapent ethyl for high-risk patients with elevated triglycerides despite statins [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Omega-3 fatty acids have **modest cardiovascular benefits**, particularly in secondary prevention and high-risk patients [^4f61e004]. Routine supplementation is not recommended for primary or secondary prevention [^0c526353]; dietary intake of 1–2 servings/week of fatty fish is reasonable [^d7d54522]. Prescription EPA (icosapent ethyl) at 4 g/day is beneficial for high-risk, hypertriglyceridemic patients on statins [^61e89ecf], but this does not generalize to OTC supplements.

### Associations of omega-3 fatty acid supplement use with cardiovascular disease risks: meta-analysis of 10 trials involving 77 917 individuals [^00aef5bf]. JAMA Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Current guidelines advocate the use of marine-derived omega-3 fatty acids supplements for the prevention of coronary heart disease and major vascular events in people with prior coronary heart disease, but large trials of omega-3 fatty acids have produced conflicting results.

Objective

To conduct a meta-analysis of all large trials assessing the associations of omega-3 fatty acid supplements with the risk of fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease and major vascular events in the full study population and prespecified subgroups.

Data Sources and Study Selection

This meta-analysis included randomized trials that involved at least 500 participants and a treatment duration of at least 1 year and that assessed associations of omega-3 fatty acids with the risk of vascular events.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Aggregated study-level data were obtained from 10 large randomized clinical trials. Rate ratios for each trial were synthesized using observed minus expected statistics and variances. Summary rate ratios were estimated by a fixed-effects meta-analysis using 95% confidence intervals for major diseases and 99% confidence intervals for all subgroups.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcomes included fatal coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, major vascular events, and all-cause mortality, as well as major vascular events in study population subgroups.

Results

Of the 77 917 high-risk individuals participating in the 10 trials, 47 803 (61.4%) were men, and the mean age at entry was 64.0 years; the trials lasted a mean of 4.4 years. The associations of treatment with outcomes were assessed on 6273 coronary heart disease events (2695 coronary heart disease deaths and 2276 nonfatal myocardial infarctions) and 12 001 major vascular events. Randomization to omega-3 fatty acid supplementation (eicosapentaenoic acid dose range, 226–1800 mg/d) had no significant associations with coronary heart disease death (rate ratio [RR], 0.93; 99% CI, 0.83–1.03; P = 0.05), nonfatal myocardial infarction (RR, 0.97; 99% CI, 0.87–1.08; P = 0.43) or any coronary heart disease events (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.90–1.01; P = 0.12). Neither did randomization to omega-3 fatty acid supplementation have any significant associations with major vascular events (RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.93–1.01; P = 0.10), overall or in any subgroups, including subgroups composed of persons with prior coronary heart disease, diabetes, lipid levels greater than a given cutoff level, or statin use.

Conclusions and Relevance

This meta-analysis demonstrated that omega-3 fatty acids had no significant association with fatal or nonfatal coronary heart disease or any major vascular events. It provides no support for current recommendations for the use of such supplements in people with a history of coronary heart disease.

### Omega-3 fatty acids: cardiovascular benefits, sources and sustainability [^7edb40eb]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

The evidence for the cardioprotective nature of omega-3 fatty acids is abundant, and currently available data indicate that patients with known coronary heart disease should consume at least 1 g daily of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids from either oily fish or fish-oil supplements, and that individuals without disease should consume at least 250–500 mg daily. However, this area of research poses two questions. Firstly, which is the best source of omega-3 fatty acids-fish or fish-oil supplements? Secondly, are recommendations for omega-3 supplementation warranted in view of the rapid depletion of world fish stocks? The argument that eating fish is better than taking fish-oil supplements stems from the fact that several important nutrients, such as vitamin D, selenium, and antioxidants, are missing from the supplements. However, three major prevention trials have clearly indicated that omega-3 fatty acid capsules confer cardiovascular benefits and, therefore, that both are cardioprotective. Sustainable sources of omega-3 fatty acids will need to be identified if long-term cardiovascular risk reduction is to be achieved at the population level.

). Intake of dietary omega-3 fatty acids was significantly inversely associated with a lower risk of CHD. Further adjustment for dietary factors did not materially change these RRs. Again, this inverse association. occurrence of the main cardiovascular end points by 20%, cardiovascular death by 30%, and all fatal events by 20%. In a secondary prevention trial, post-MI patients receiving an experimental diet that included. In our cohort, omega-3 fatty acid intake and fish consumption were associated with a significantly lower risk of CHD. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that omega-3 fatty acids are the active agent primarily responsible for the apparent protective effect of fish. Omega-3 fatty acids may reduce CHD incidence and mortality through multiple mechanisms, including reduction.

of serum triglycerides, 26 platelet aggregability, 27 and antiarrhythmic effects. 28 Animal studies have established that fish oil intake effectively reduces the incidence and duration of cardiac arrhythmia. 29 In a case-control study, Siscovick et al30 found that dietary intake and cell membrane levels of long-chain omega-3 fatty. shown that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation improves endothelial-dependent vasomotor function. 34, 35 The beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids on endothelial function may in part explain the inverse association we observed for nonfatal MI. Aspirin decreases the risk of CHD in part by blocking the cyclooxygenase. enzyme that converts arachidonic acid to thromboxane, inhibiting platelet aggregation.

36 Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids also interact with cyclooxygenase enzymes; however, these fatty acids act as a substrate for the enzymes, leading to the production of an inactive thromboxane moiety in platelets and an active prostaglandin molecule in endothelial cells. 37 The result is reduced platelet aggregation and increased. relationship between fish consumption and reduction in CHD risk through antiarrhythmic and antithrombotic effects of fish oil, as well as the consistency of the present findings with those from other prospective cohort studies and secondary prevention trials, supports the likelihood of a causal association. In conclusion, this prospective study provides strong evidence for an.

### Omega-3 fatty acids and coronary heart disease risk: clinical and mechanistic perspectives [^3d72d9aa]. Atherosclerosis (2008). Low credibility.

The most common omega-3 fatty acids contain 18–22 carbons and a signature double bond at the third position from the methyl (or n, or omega) end of the molecule. These fatty acids must be obtained in the diet as they cannot be synthesized by vertebrates. They include the plant-derived alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3n-3), and the fish-oil-derived eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3). Normally, very little ALA is converted to EPA, and even less to DHA, and therefore direct intake of the latter two is optimal. EPA and DHA and their metabolites have important biologic functions, including effects on membranes, eicosanoid metabolism, and gene transcription. Studies indicate that the use of fish oil is associated with coronary heart disease risk reduction. A number of mechanisms may be responsible for such effects. These include prevention of arrhythmias as well as lowering heart rate and blood pressure, decreasing platelet aggregation, and lowering triglyceride levels. The latter is accomplished by decreasing the production of hepatic triglycerides and increasing the clearance of plasma triglycerides. Our focus is to review the potential mechanisms by which these fatty acids reduce cardiovascular disease risk.

### Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and cardiovascular diseases [^ef6d6bb1]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (omega-3 PUFA) therapy continues to show great promise in primary and, particularly in secondary prevention of cardiovascular (CV) diseases. The most compelling evidence for CV benefits of omega-3 PUFA comes from 4 controlled trials of nearly 40,000 participants randomized to receive eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) with or without docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in studies of patients in primary prevention, after myocardial infarction, and most recently, with heart failure (HF). We discuss the evidence from retrospective epidemiologic studies and from large randomized controlled trials showing the benefits of omega-3 PUFA, specifically EPA and DHA, in primary and secondary CV prevention and provide insight into potential mechanisms of these observed benefits. The target EPA + DHA consumption should be at least 500 mg/day for individuals without underlying overt CV disease and at least 800 to 1,000 mg/day for individuals with known coronary heart disease and HF. Further studies are needed to determine optimal dosing and the relative ratio of DHA and EPA omega-3 PUFA that provides maximal cardioprotection in those at risk of CV disease as well in the treatment of atherosclerotic, arrhythmic, and primary myocardial disorders.

### Fish oil and omega-3 fatty acids in cardiovascular disease: do they really work? [^cadeee80]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Omega-3 fatty acids, which are found abundantly in fish oil, exert pleiotropic cardiometabolic effects with a diverse range of actions. The results of previous studies raised a lot of interest in the role of fish oil and omega-3 fatty acids in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. The present review will focus on the current clinical uses of omega-3 fatty acids and provide an update on their effects. Since recently published trials in patients with coronary artery diseases or post-myocardial infarction did not show an effect of omega-3 fatty acids on major cardiovascular endpoints, this review will examine the limitations of those data and suggest recommendations for the use of omega-3 fatty acids.

### Omega-3 fatty acids for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^11f073b0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Researchers have suggested that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from oily fish (long-chain omega-3 (LCn3), including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)), as well as from plants (alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)) benefit cardiovascular health. Guidelines recommend increasing omega-3-rich foods, and sometimes supplementation, but recent trials have not confirmed this.

Objectives

To assess effects of increased intake of fish- and plant-based omega-3 for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular (CVD) events, adiposity and lipids.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase to April 2017, plus ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry to September 2016, with no language restrictions. We handsearched systematic review references and bibliographies and contacted authors.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that lasted at least 12 months and compared supplementation and/or advice to increase LCn3 or ALA intake versus usual or lower intake.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed validity. We performed separate random-effects meta-analysis for ALA and LCn3 interventions, and assessed dose-response relationships through meta-regression.

Main Results

We included 79 RCTs (112,059 participants) in this review update and found that 25 were at low summary risk of bias. Trials were of 12 to 72 months' duration and included adults at varying cardiovascular risk, mainly in high-income countries. Most studies assessed LCn3 supplementation with capsules, but some used LCn3- or ALA-rich or enriched foods or dietary advice compared to placebo or usual diet. Meta-analysis and sensitivity analyses suggested little or no effect of increasing LCn3 on all-cause mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.03, 92,653 participants; 8189 deaths in 39 trials, high-quality evidence), cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.03, 67,772 participants; 4544 CVD deaths in 25 RCTs), cardiovascular events (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.04, 90,378 participants; 14,737 people experienced events in 38 trials, high-quality evidence), coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.09, 73,491 participants; 1596 CHD deaths in 21 RCTs), stroke (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.16, 89,358 participants; 1822 strokes in 28 trials) or arrhythmia (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.05, 53,796 participants; 3788 people experienced arrhythmia in 28 RCTs). There was a suggestion that LCn3 reduced CHD events (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.97, 84,301 participants; 5469 people experienced CHD events in 28 RCTs); however, this was not maintained in sensitivity analyses - LCn3 probably makes little or no difference to CHD event risk. All evidence was of moderate GRADE quality, except as noted. Increasing ALA intake probably makes little or no difference to all-cause mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.20, 19,327 participants; 459 deaths, 5 RCTs), cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.25, 18,619 participants; 219 cardiovascular deaths, 4 RCTs), and it may make little or no difference to CHD events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.22, 19,061 participants, 397 CHD events, 4 RCTs, low-quality evidence). However, increased ALA may slightly reduce risk of cardiovascular events (from 4.8% to 4.7%, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.07, 19,327 participants; 884 CVD events, 5 RCTs, low-quality evidence), and probably reduces risk of CHD mortality (1.1% to 1.0%, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.26, 18,353 participants; 193 CHD deaths, 3 RCTs), and arrhythmia (3.3% to 2.6%, RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.10, 4,837 participants; 141 events, 1 RCT). Effects on stroke are unclear. Sensitivity analysis retaining only trials at low summary risk of bias moved effect sizes towards the null (RR 1.0) for all LCn3 primary outcomes except arrhythmias, but for most ALA outcomes, effect sizes moved to suggest protection. LCn3 funnel plots suggested that adding in missing studies/results would move effect sizes towards null for most primary outcomes. There were no dose or duration effects in subgrouping or meta-regression. There was no evidence that increasing LCn3 or ALA altered serious adverse events, adiposity or lipids, although LCn3 slightly reduced triglycerides and increased HDL. ALA probably reduces HDL (high- or moderate-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

This is the most extensive systematic assessment of effects of omega-3 fats on cardiovascular health to date. Moderate- and high-quality evidence suggests that increasing EPA and DHA has little or no effect on mortality or cardiovascular health (evidence mainly from supplement trials). Previous suggestions of benefits from EPA and DHA supplements appear to spring from trials with higher risk of bias. Low-quality evidence suggests ALA may slightly reduce CVD event risk, CHD mortality and arrhythmia.

### Omega-3 fatty acids in the prevention and control of cardiovascular disease [^f719e9d0]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is one of the main causes of death in developed countries. Several factors are involved in its appearance and progress, among which nutrition enjoys a certain protagonism. Until recently, the dietetic criteria for preventing and controlling cardiovascular disease were mainly restrictive (at least in terms of energy and fat intake), but such advice is difficult to follow, and without careful monitoring can lead to deficiencies that might negatively affect quality of life and perhaps even life expectancy. Several investigations show that some components of the lipid fraction of the diet, such as omega-3 fatty acids, are beneficial with respect to cardiovascular disease, and these have become the centre of much attention. This paper reviews the results of some of these studies and evaluates the benefit of these fatty acids in the prevention of coronary heart disease. The sources of omega-3 fatty acids, their recommended consumption, possible mechanisms of action and potential adverse effects are discussed.

### The omega-3 index: a new risk factor for death from coronary heart disease? [^2ce589fb]. Preventive Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Low intakes or blood levels of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (EPA + DHA) are independently associated with increased risk of death from coronary heart disease (CHD). In randomized secondary prevention trials, fish or fish oil have been demonstrated to reduce total and CHD mortality at intakes of about 1 g/day. Red blood cell (RBC) fatty acid (FA) composition reflects long-term intake of EPA + DHA. We propose that the RBC EPA + DHA (hereafter called the Omega-3 Index) be considered a new risk factor for death from CHD.

Methods

We conducted clinical and laboratory experiments to generate data necessary for the validation of the Omega-3 Index as a CHD risk predictor. The relationship between this putative marker and risk for CHD death, especially sudden cardiac death (SCD), was then evaluated in several published primary and secondary prevention studies.

Results

The Omega-3 Index was inversely associated with risk for CHD mortality. An Omega-3 Index of ≥ 8% was associated with the greatest cardioprotection, whereas an index of ≤ 4% was associated with the least.

Conclusion

The Omega-3 Index may represent a novel, physiologically relevant, easily modified, independent, and graded risk factor for death from CHD that could have significant clinical utility.

### Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (fish oil) supplementation and the prevention of clinical cardiovascular disease: a science advisory from the American Heart Association [^dced81dc]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have assessed the effects of supplementation with eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid (omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, commonly called fish oils) on the occurrence of clinical cardiovascular diseases. Although the effects of supplementation for the primary prevention of clinical cardiovascular events in the general population have not been examined, RCTs have assessed the role of supplementation in secondary prevention among patients with diabetes mellitus and prediabetes, patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease, and those with prevalent coronary heart disease. In this scientific advisory, we take a clinical approach and focus on common indications for omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplements related to the prevention of clinical cardiovascular events. We limited the scope of our review to large RCTs of supplementation with major clinical cardiovascular disease end points; meta-analyses were considered secondarily. We discuss the features of available RCTs and provide the rationale for our recommendations. We then use existing American Heart Association criteria to assess the strength of the recommendation and the level of evidence. On the basis of our review of the cumulative evidence from RCTs designed to assess the effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation on clinical cardiovascular events, we update prior recommendations for patients with prevalent coronary heart disease, and we offer recommendations, when data are available, for patients with other clinical indications, including patients with diabetes mellitus and prediabetes and those with high risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation.

### The omega-3 index and relative risk for coronary heart disease mortality: estimation from 10 cohort studies [^0fe36532]. Atherosclerosis (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

A recent 19-cohort meta-analysis examined the relationships between biomarkers of omega-3 fatty acids and risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). That study did not, however, report hazard ratios (HRs) specifically as a function of erythrocyte eicosapentaenoic (EPA) plus docosahexaenoic (DHA) levels, a metric called the Omega-3 Index in which EPA + DHA content is expressed as a percent of total fatty acids. The Omega-3 Index has been used in several recent studies and is a validated biomarker of omega-3 fatty acid tissue levels, but additional data are needed to confirm (or refute) the originally-proposed clinical cut-points of < 4% (higher risk) and 8%-12% (lower risk).

Methods

The present study was therefore undertaken using published data from this meta-analysis to estimate HRs per 1-SD increase in the Omega-3 Index and median quintile values for this metric across 10 of the cohorts for which the needed data were available.

Results

The overall mean (SD) for the Omega-3 Index in these 10 cohort studies was 6.1% (2.1%), and the HR for a 1-SD increase was 0.85 (95% confidence interval, 0.80–0.91). Median quintile 1 and 5 levels were 4.2% vs. 8.3%, respectively. Based on these values, we estimate that risk for fatal CHD would have been reduced by about 30% moving from an Omega-3 Index of 4%-8%.

Conclusions

These findings support the use of < 4% and > 8% as reasonable therapeutic targets for the Omega-3 Index.

In this paper, we will give an overview of the background for the possible effects of long-chain marine n-3 (synonymously called omega-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in coronary heart disease (CHD) with focus on recent findings. In a forthcoming paper, we will focus on the clinical trial data, current recommendations and suggest trials to further study the role of marine n-3 PUFA in the prevention and treatment of CHD.

### Associations of omega-3 fatty acid supplement use with cardiovascular disease risks: meta-analysis of 10 trials involving 77 917 individuals [^5e433c44]. JAMA Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The 2016 European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines for prevention of cardiovascular diseaseindicated that it is debatable whether omega-3 FAs may exert a protective effect, and the 2016 guidelines on the management of dyslipidaemiaindicated that more evidence on the efficacy of omega-3 FA supplements for prevention of clinical outcomes is needed to justify their prescription. In contrast, the American Heart Association recommendedthat the use of omega-3 FAs for prevention of CHD is probably justified in individuals with prior CHD and those with heart failure and reduced ejection fractions. However, the results of the present meta-analysis provide no support for the recommendations to use approximately 1 g/d of omega-3 FAs in individuals with a history of CHD for the prevention of fatal CHD, nonfatal MI, or any other vascular events. The results of the ongoing trials are needed to assess if higher doses of omega-3 FAs (3–4 g/d) may have significant effects on risk of major vascular events.

### Conclusions and recommendations from the symposium, beyond cholesterol: prevention and treatment of coronary heart disease with n-3 fatty acids [^b464043c]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

After the symposium "Beyond Cholesterol: Prevention and Treatment of Coronary Heart Disease with n-3 Fatty Acids", faculty who presented at the conference submitted manuscripts relating to their conference topics, and these are presented in this supplement. The content of these manuscripts was reviewed, and 2 conference calls were convened. The objective was to summarize existing evidence, gaps in evidence, and future research needed to strengthen recommendations for specific intakes of n-3 fatty acids for different conditions relating to cardiovascular disease. The following 2 questions were the main items discussed. What are the roles of n-3 fatty acids in primary versus secondary prevention of coronary heart disease? What are the roles of n-3 fatty acids in hypertriglyceridemia, in the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, and in sudden cardiac death, cardiac arrhythmias, and vulnerable plaque? Each area was summarized by using 2 general categories: 1) current knowledge for which general consensus exists, and 2) recommendations for research and policy. Additional references for these conclusions can be found in the articles included in the supplement.

### Fish and n-3 fatty acids for the prevention of fatal coronary heart disease and sudden cardiac death [^ee260e21]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Large observational studies, randomized clinical trials, and experimental studies have evaluated the effects of fish and n-3 fatty acid consumption on fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) and sudden cardiac death (SCD), clinically defined events that most often share the final common pathway of fatal ventricular arrhythmia. These different study designs, each having complementary strengths and limitations, provide strong concordant evidence that modest consumption of fish or fish oil (1–2 servings/wk of oily fish, or approximately 250 mg/d of EPA+DHA) substantially reduces the risk of CHD death and SCD. Pooled analysis of prospective cohort studies and randomized clinical trials demonstrates the magnitude and dose-response of this effect, with 36% lower risk of CHD death comparing 0 and 250 mg/d of EPA+DHA consumption (P < 0.001), but then little additional benefit with higher intakes. Reductions in risk are even larger in observational studies utilizing tissue biomarkers of n-3 fatty acids that more accurately measure dietary consumption. The concordance of findings from different studies also suggests that effects of fish or fish oil on CHD death and SCD do not vary depending on presence or absence of established CHD. The strength and consistency of the evidence, and the magnitude of this effect are each notable. Because more than one-half of all CHD deaths and two-thirds of SCD occur among individuals without recognized heart disease, modest consumption of fish or fish oil, together with smoking cessation and regular moderate physical activity, should be among the first-line treatments for prevention of CHD death and SCD.

Associations of Omega-3 Fatty Acid Use With CHD Events by Study Design

Figure 4 demonstrates that randomization of patients to receive omega-3 FAs had no significant association with their experience of nonfatal MI, CHD death, or overall CHD in trials that used either an open-label and blind design. However, there was some evidence of heterogeneity between the results of open-label trials vs blind trials for all participants with CHD (open-label trials: RR, 0.85; 99% CI, 0.72–0.99; P = 0.01; blinded trials: RR, 0.99; 99% CI, 0.91–1.07; P = 0.69; heterogeneity P = 0.03), but not for either fatal CHD or nonfatal MI, respectively. Overall, the results of this meta-analysis demonstrated no significant association of supplementation with omega-3 FAs for a mean duration of 4.4 years with the risk of fatal CHD, nonfatal MI, any CHD, or any major vascular events in the full study population and in all relevant subgroups.

Associations of Omega-3 Fatty Acids With Fatal and Nonfatal Vascular Events, by Trial Design

Symbols and conventions as in Figure 1. Heterogeneity between trial designs (χ²₁ in all cases) was 1.05 (P = 0.31) for nonfatal myocardial infarction, 3.26 (P = 0.07) for coronary heart disease death, and 4.81 (P = 0.03) for any coronary heart disease.

Associations of Omega-3 Fatty Acid Use With All-Cause Mortality

Randomization to omega-3 FA intervention had no significant association with RRs of all-cause mortality (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.92–1.01; P = 0.16). Further information is presented in eFigure 5 in the Supplement.

### Marine omega-3 supplementation and cardiovascular disease: an updated meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials involving 127 477 participants [^640b4f52]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Whether marine or long‐chain omega‐3 fatty acid supplementation has significant benefits in reducing risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the subject of intense debate. Despite consistent findings from observational studies showing inverse associations between higher fish consumption and lower risk of heart disease, 1, 2 recent evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing marine omega‐3 supplementation, usually a moderate‐dose combination of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid compared with placebo, have had largely null results. 3, 4 Although the American Heart Association continues to recommend marine omega‐3 supplementation for patients with prevalent coronary heart disease to reduce mortality, it found insufficient evidence for use in prevention among patients at high CVD risk but without CVD. 5 A recent meta‐analysis synthesizing study‐level data from 10 midsize‐to‐large RCTs with at least 1 year of follow‐up reported no significant favorable effects of marine omega‐3 fatty acid supplementation on fatal or nonfatal coronary heart disease (CHD) or any major vascular events. 6 Another expanded meta‐analysis including smaller trials and dietary intervention trials reached the same conclusions. 7 Inconsistent findings between observational studies and RCTs cast doubt on a causal relationship between fish oil supplements and CVD prevention. 8

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^a32bff4e]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Omega-3 fatty acids for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) — trial and meta-analysis evidence: Harris et al. noted 9 large randomized trials of omega-3 fatty acid supplements, with 4 positive, 4 neutral, and 1 negative; positive trials (1980s to early 2000s) used EPA and DHA intakes between 0.85 and 1.8 g/day, whereas neutral trials (2010–2012) provided 376 to 840 mg/day of EPA and DHA. Evidence syntheses include five systematic reviews and meta-analyses; two published before 2010 reported benefits in existing CHD, but three published after 2010 did not report benefits. A frequently cited meta-analysis (Rizos et al.) was criticized for using a significance threshold of 0.006 instead of 0.05; without this maneuver, fish oil supplementation significantly reduced risk for cardiac death by 9% [RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.85–0.98; P = 0.011].

### Cardiovascular effects of omega-3 fatty acids: hope or hype? [^5ee2a64b]. Atherosclerosis (2021). Medium credibility.

Omega-3 fatty acids have emerged as a new option for controlling the residual risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the statin era after a clinical trial (REDUCE-IT) reported positive results with icosapent ethyl (IPE) in patients receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy. However, another trial which used high dose eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) combination (STRENGTH) has failed. Together, these results raise clinically important questions. Are effects of omega-3 fatty acids neutral or beneficial in patients on statin therapy, or perhaps even harmful? The current contradictory results could be attributed to different types of omega-3 fatty acids (only EPA or combination of EPA + DHA), doses (higher vs. lower dose) of omega-3 fatty acids or different comparators (corn oil or mineral oil), as well as the underlying severity of the CVD risk or use of statins. Together with these issues, we will discuss different biological and clinical effects of various types of omega-3 fatty acids and then interpret different results of past and current clinical studies and propose practical suggestions, which could be applied in patient management.

### Polyunsaturated fatty acids for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^183c0127]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence on the health effects of total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is equivocal. Fish oils are rich in omega-3 PUFA and plant oils in omega-6 PUFA. Evidence suggests that increasing PUFA-rich foods, supplements or supplemented foods can reduce serum cholesterol, but may increase body weight, so overall cardiovascular effects are unclear.

Objectives

To assess effects of increasing total PUFA intake on cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality, lipids and adiposity in adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase to April 2017 and clinicaltrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to September 2016, without language restrictions. We checked trials included in relevant systematic reviews.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing higher with lower PUFA intakes in adults with or without cardiovascular disease that assessed effects over 12 months or longer. We included full texts, abstracts, trials registry entries and unpublished data. Outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality and events, risk factors (blood lipids, adiposity, blood pressure), and adverse events. We excluded trials where we could not separate effects of PUFA intake from other dietary, lifestyle or medication interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts, assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We wrote to authors of included trials for further data. Meta-analyses used random-effects analysis, sensitivity analyses included fixed-effects and limiting to low summary risk of bias. We assessed GRADE quality of evidence.

Main Results

We included 49 RCTs randomising 24,272 participants, with duration of one to eight years. Eleven included trials were at low summary risk of bias, 33 recruited participants without cardiovascular disease. Baseline PUFA intake was unclear in most trials, but 3.9% to 8% of total energy intake where reported. Most trials gave supplemental capsules, but eight gave dietary advice, eight gave supplemental foods such as nuts or margarine, and three used a combination of methods to increase PUFA. Increasing PUFA intake probably has little or no effect on all-cause mortality (risk 7.8% vs 7.6%, risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.07, 19,290 participants in 24 trials), but probably slightly reduces risk of coronary heart disease events from 14.2% to 12.3% (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.06, 15 trials, 10,076 participants) and cardiovascular disease events from 14.6% to 13.0% (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.01, 17,799 participants in 21 trials), all moderate-quality evidence. Increasing PUFA may slightly reduce risk of coronary heart disease death (6.6% to 6.1%, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.06, 9 trials, 8810 participants) andstroke (1.2% to 1.1%, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.44, 11 trials, 14,742 participants, though confidence intervals include important harms), but has little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.26, 16 trials, 15,107 participants) all low-quality evidence. Effects of increasing PUFA on major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events and atrial fibrillation are unclear as evidence is of very low quality. Increasing PUFA intake probably slightly decreases triglycerides (by 15%, MD -0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.04, 20 trials, 3905 participants), but has little or no effect on total cholesterol (mean difference (MD) -0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.02, 26 trials, 8072 participants), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (MD -0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.01, 18 trials, 4674 participants) or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (MD -0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.06, 15 trials, 3362 participants). Increasing PUFA probably has little or no effect on adiposity (body weight MD 0.76 kg, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.19, 12 trials, 7100 participants). Effects of increasing PUFA on serious adverse events such as pulmonary embolism and bleeding are unclear as the evidence is of very low quality.

Authors' Conclusions

This is the most extensive systematic review of RCTs conducted to date to assess effects of increasing PUFA on cardiovascular disease, mortality, lipids or adiposity. Increasing PUFA intake probably slightly reduces risk of coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease events, may slightly reduce risk of coronary heart disease mortality and stroke (though not ruling out harms), but has little or no effect on all-cause or cardiovascular disease mortality. The mechanism may be via TG reduction.

### Evidence for the cardioprotective effects of omega-3 fatty acids [^bfd9a8b1]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To review available literature regarding the cardiovascular effects of marine-derived Omega-3 fatty acids and evaluate the benefit of these fatty acids in the prevention of coronary heart disease.

Data Sources

Biomedical literature accessed through a MEDLINE search (1966-April 2002). Search terms included fish oil, omega-3 fatty acid, sudden death, hypertriglyceridemia, myocardial infarction, and mortality.

Data Synthesis

Following an early 1970's observational investigation that Omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the occurrence of myocardial infarction-related deaths in Greenland Eskimos, additional trials have been conducted that support this finding. Epidemiologic and clinical trial data suggest that Omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the risk of cardiovascular-related death by 29–52%. In addition, the risk of sudden cardiac death was found to be reduced by 45–81%. Possible mechanisms for these beneficial effects include antiarrhythmic properties, improved endothelial function, antiinflammatory action, and reductions in serum triglyceride concentrations. Omega-3 Fatty acids are fairly well tolerated; potential adverse effects include bloating and gastrointestinal distress, "fishy taste" in the mouth, hyperglycemia, increased risk of bleeding, and a slight increase in low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol.

Conclusions

Omega-3 Fatty acids may be beneficial and should be considered in patients with documented coronary heart disease. They may be particularly beneficial for patients with risk factors for sudden cardiac death.

### Recent findings on the health effects of omega-3 fatty acids and statins, and their interactions: do statins inhibit omega-3? [^3948a575]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Contrary to the expectations, the most recent RCTs - that is, those published after 2005 - did not confirm the protective action of n-3. In a recent meta-analysis examining the efficacy of n-3 supplements (EPA+DHA) in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD), authors analyzed 13 RCTs involving 20,485 patients with a history of CHD and concluded that n-3 supplements did not consistently reduce CHD mortality, all-cause mortality and the risk of overall CVD complications. An explanation could be that the populations enrolled in the most recent RCTs were different from those tested in the past RCTs. Indeed, the authors did not separate early (positive) and recent (negative) RCTs in their meta-analyses and thereby ignored any temporal changes in the dietary and blood n-3 status of the patients enrolled in the early or the recent RCTs. Also, in subgroup analyses by concomitant medication use, the authors report a non-significant preventive effect against the risk of CVD events (relative risk 0.74, 95% confidence intervals 0.54 to 1.03) among patients not receiving statins whereas those receiving statins had no protection at all: relative risk 1.02, 95% confidence intervals 0.92 to 1.12. These data suggest strong interactions between n-3 and statins and may at least partly explain the discrepancy between recent and early RCTs because the use of statins has become almost systematic among patients in recent RCTs, whereas it was rare or even absent in early RCTs.

Another puzzling observation is that, contrary to the results of recent RCTs, recent epidemiological studies examining associations between n-3 (or fish intake) and CVD in various populations still demonstrate significant inverse correlation. This further suggests that in populations with low use of statins, n-3 remain apparently protective.

How could these findings be explained?

### Ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid biomarkers and coronary heart disease: pooling project of 19 cohort studies [^5092686c]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

The role of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) remains controversial. Most prior longitudinal studies evaluated self-reported consumption rather than biomarkers.

Objective

To evaluate biomarkers of seafood-derived eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5ω-3), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA; 22:5ω-3), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6ω-3) and plant-derived α-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3ω-3) for incident CHD.

Data Sources

A global consortium of 19 studies identified by November 2014.

Study Selection

Available prospective (cohort, nested case-control) or retrospective studies with circulating or tissue ω-3 biomarkers and ascertained CHD.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Each study conducted standardized, individual-level analysis using harmonized models, exposures, outcomes, and covariates. Findings were centrally pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was examined by age, sex, race, diabetes, statins, aspirin, ω-6 levels, and FADS desaturase genes.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Incident total CHD, fatal CHD, and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI).

Results

The 19 studies comprised 16 countries, 45 637 unique individuals, and 7973 total CHD, 2781 fatal CHD, and 7157 nonfatal MI events, with ω-3 measures in total plasma, phospholipids, cholesterol esters, and adipose tissue. Median age at baseline was 59 years (range, 18–97 years), and 28 660 (62.8%) were male. In continuous (per 1-SD increase) multivariable-adjusted analyses, the ω-3 biomarkers ALA, DPA, and DHA were associated with a lower risk of fatal CHD, with relative risks (RRs) of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.84–0.98) for ALA, 0.90 (95% CI, 0.85–0.96) for DPA, and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.84–0.96) for DHA. Although DPA was associated with a lower risk of total CHD (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90–0.99), ALA (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.95–1.05), EPA (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.87–1.02), and DHA (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91–1.00) were not. Significant associations with nonfatal MI were not evident. Associations appeared generally stronger in phospholipids and total plasma. Restricted cubic splines did not identify evidence of nonlinearity in dose responses.

Conclusions and Relevance

On the basis of available studies of free-living populations globally, biomarker concentrations of seafood and plant-derived ω-3 fatty acids are associated with a modestly lower incidence of fatal CHD.

### Antiatherosclerotic and antithrombotic effects of omega-3 fatty acids [^e31ba97f]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Omega-3 fatty acids from both marine and plant sources have been shown to reduce the risk of coronary artery disease death. Although their beneficial cardiovascular effects are thought to be due to their antiarrhythmic properties, omega-3 fatty acids also have been shown to have a wide range of antiatherosclerotic and antithrombotic effects in animal and human studies. Review of the findings of randomized, controlled trials published through August 2005 shows that omega-3 fatty acids of marine origin consistently lower elevated plasma triglyceride levels in a dose-dependent fashion, with greater efficacy at higher triglyceride levels. Smaller effects on lowering blood pressure, improving endothelial function, and increasing plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were also found. No consistent effects on other lipid, hemostatic, inflammatory, glucose tolerance, or plaque stabilization parameters were found. Epidemiologic studies show more consistent reductions in the incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke than do the clinical trials of increased omega-3 fatty acid intake, which suggests important confounding factors in observational studies. Ongoing clinical trials may clarify the non-antiarrhythmic benefits of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation.

### Associations of omega-3 fatty acid supplement use with cardiovascular disease risks: meta-analysis of 10 trials involving 77 917 individuals [^23f79e53]. JAMA Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Observational studies in Western and Asian populations have reported that regular consumption of fish once or twice a week is associated with lower risks of death from coronary heart disease (CHD). These observations, together with the lower rates of CHD in populations that consumed large amount of foods rich in very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids containing omega-3 fatty acids have prompted interest in assessing whether consumption of marine-derived very-long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (abbreviated "omega-3 FA" in this article) may be protective for CHD. These marine-derived omega-3 FAs include eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexanoic acid (DHA) found in fish and other seafood, but not alpha-linolenic acid, which is plant-derived.

### Circulating fatty acids and risk of coronary heart disease and stroke: individual participant data meta-analysis in up to 16 126 participants [^373ed2d8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Early interest in the relation of dietary fatty acids with cardiovascular disease emerged following results from ecological studies conducted between the 1950s and 1970s. These studies indicated that populations with high consumption of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) had increased rates of mortality from cardiovascular diseases, 1 while reduced cardiovascular disease mortality was observed in populations with high consumption of omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. 2, 3 Numerous subsequent controlled feeding studies showed that dietary fatty acid composition could modulate the concentration of the major circulating blood lipid fractions (mainly total, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol and triacylglycerols). 4 These observations played a central role in the classical diet‐heart hypothesis and have prompted recommendations on dietary fatty acid intake for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. 5, 6, 7

In the past few decades, however, some long‐lasting beliefs concerning the effects of fatty acids on health have been challenged. For example, it has been argued that the effect of reduction of dietary SFAs on coronary heart disease (CHD) may depend on what dietary components they replace (carbohydrates or polyunsaturated fatty acids). 8 In addition, systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported heterogeneous results regarding the protective effect of omega‐3 fatty acids on cardiovascular outcomes with more recent trials failing to replicate initial positive findings. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 The reasons for inconsistent findings remain elusive, although several methodological issues may have contributed to heterogeneity in both RCTs and observational studies. In the case of omega‐3, a recent systematic review of RCTs that lasted at least 12 months (n = 112 059 participants) concluded that increasing omega‐3 intake has little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality and found no evidence of differential effects according to omega‐3 dose, trial duration, and primary or secondary prevention. 13 For other fatty acids, evidence is less convincing. 14 Furthermore, most studies have focused on CHD as the outcome; hence, the relevance of most fatty acids for cerebrovascular disease remains unclear.

### Omega-3 dietary supplements and the risk of cardiovascular events: a systematic review [^e3a4b449]. Clinical Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Epidemiologic data suggest that omega-3 fatty acids derived from fish oil reduce cardiovascular disease. The clinical benefit of dietary fish oil supplementation in preventing cardiovascular events in both high and low risk patients is unclear.

Objective

To assess whether dietary supplements of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) decrease cardiovascular events across a spectrum of patients.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and citation review of relevant primary and review articles.

Study Selection

Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials that evaluated clinical cardiovascular end points (cardiovascular death, sudden death, and nonfatal cardiovascular events) and all-cause mortality in patients randomized to EPA/DHA or placebo. We only included studies that used dietary supplements of EPA/DHA which were administered for at least 1 year.

Data Extraction

Data were abstracted on study design, study size, type and dose of omega-3 supplement, cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality, and duration of follow-up. Studies were grouped according to the risk of cardiovascular events (high risk and moderate risk). Meta-analytic techniques were used to analyze the data.

Data Synthesis

We identified 11 studies that included a total of 39 044 patients. The studies included patients after recent myocardial infarction, those with an implanted cardioverter defibrillator, and patients with heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and hypercholesterolemia. The average dose of EPA/DHA was 1.8 ± 1.2 g/day and the mean duration of follow-up was 2.2 ± 1.2 years. Dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular deaths (odds ratio [OR]: 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.79–0.95, p = 0.002), sudden cardiac death (OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.76–0.99, p = 0.04), all-cause mortality (OR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.85–0.99, p = 0.02), and nonfatal cardiovascular events (OR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.85–0.99, p = 0.02). The mortality benefit was largely due to the studies which enrolled high risk patients, while the reduction in nonfatal cardiovascular events was noted in the moderate risk patients (secondary prevention only). Meta-regression failed to demonstrate a relationship between the daily dose of omega-3 fatty acid and clinical outcome.

Conclusions

Dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids should be considered in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events.

### Fish and omega-3 fatty acid intake and risk of coronary heart disease in women [^5b931590]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

Higher consumption of fish and omega-3 fatty acids has been associated with a lower risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in men, but limited data are available regarding women.

Objective

To examine the association between fish and long-chain omega-3 fatty acid consumption and risk of CHD in women.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Dietary consumption and follow-up data from 84 688 female nurses enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study, aged 34 to 59 years and free from cardiovascular disease and cancer at baseline in 1980, were compared from validated questionnaires completed in 1980, 1984, 1986, 1990, and 1994.

Main Outcome Measures

Incident nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD deaths.

Results

During 16 years of follow-up, there were 1513 incident cases of CHD (484 CHD deaths and 1029 nonfatal myocardial infarctions). Compared with women who rarely ate fish (< 1 per month), those with a higher intake of fish had a lower risk of CHD. After adjustment for age, smoking, and other cardiovascular risk factors, the multivariable relative risks (RRs) of CHD were 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64–0.97) for fish consumption 1 to 3 times per month, 0.71 (95% CI, 0.58–0.87) for once per week, 0.69 (95% CI, 0.55–0.88) for 2 to 4 times per week, and 0.66 (95% CI, 0.50–0.89) for 5 or more times per week (P for trend = .001). Similarly, women with a higher intake of omega-3 fatty acids had a lower risk of CHD, with multivariable RRs of 1.0, 0.93, 0.78, 0.68, and 0.67 (P < .001 for trend) across quintiles of intake. For fish intake and omega-3 fatty acids, the inverse association appeared to be stronger for CHD deaths (multivariate RR for fish consumption 5 times per week, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.33–0.90] for CHD deaths vs 0.73 [0.51–1.04]) than for nonfatal myocardial infarction.

Conclusion

Among women, higher consumption of fish and omega-3 fatty acids is associated with a lower risk of CHD, particularly CHD deaths.

### Effect of omega-3 fatty acids on cardiovascular outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^779682b9]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we noted moderate certainty of evidence favoring omega-3 FAs for reducing cardiovascular mortality and outcomes. The magnitude of relative reductions was robust in EPA trials vs. those of EPA+DHA, suggesting differential effects of EPA and DHA in cardiovascular risk reduction. These findings also have important implications for clinical practice and treatment guidelines. After REDUCE-IT, several national and international guidelines endorsed EPA in their therapeutic recommendations. However, the publication of two recent negative trials of EPA + DHA has created some confusion in the scientific community about the value of omega-3 FAs in preventing ASCVD events. This meta-analysis provides reassurance about the role of omega-3 FAs, specifically EPA, in the current treatment framework of ASCVD residual cardiovascular risk reduction and encourages investigators to explore further the cardiovascular effects of EPA across different clinical settings.

### Omega-3 fatty acids [^12e12f02]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to significantly reduce the risk for sudden death caused by cardiac arrhythmias and all-cause mortality in patients with known coronary heart disease. Fatty fish, such as salmon and tuna, and fish oil are rich sources of the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. Flaxseed, canola oil, and walnuts also are good dietary sources of omega-3 fatty acids. In addition to being antiarrhythmic, the omega-3 fatty acids are antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory. In contrast, omega-6 fatty acids, which are present in most seeds, vegetable oils, and meat, are prothrombotic and proinflammatory. Omega-3 fatty acids also are used to treat hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and rheumatoid arthritis. There are no significant drug interactions with omega-3 fatty acids. The American Heart Association recommends consumption of two servings of fish per week for persons with no history of coronary heart disease and at least one serving of fish daily for those with known coronary heart disease. Approximately 1 g per day of eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid is recommended for cardioprotection. Higher dosages of omega-3 fatty acids are required to reduce elevated triglyceride levels (2 to 4 g per day) and to reduce morning stiffness and the number of tender joints in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (at least 3 g per day). Modest decreases in blood pressure occur with significantly higher dosages of omega-3 fatty acids.

### Optimal diets for prevention of coronary heart disease [^a9d316f6]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains the leading cause of mortality in industrialized countries and is rapidly becoming a primary cause of death worldwide. Thus, identification of the dietary changes that most effectively prevent CHD is critical.

Objective

To review metabolic, epidemiologic, and clinical trial evidence regarding diet and CHD prevention.

Data Sources and Study Selection

We searched MEDLINE through May 2002 for epidemiologic and clinical investigations of major dietary factors (fat, cholesterol, omega-3 fatty acids, trans-fatty acids, carbohydrates, glycemic index, fiber, folate, specific foods, and dietary patterns) and CHD. We selected 147 original investigations and reviews of metabolic studies, epidemiologic studies, and dietary intervention trials of diet and CHD.

Data Extraction

Data were examined for relevance and quality and extracted by 1 of the authors.

Data Synthesis

Compelling evidence from metabolic studies, prospective cohort studies, and clinical trials in the past several decades indicates that at least 3 dietary strategies are effective in preventing CHD: substitute nonhydrogenated unsaturated fats for saturated and trans-fats; increase consumption of omega-3 fatty acids from fish, fish oil supplements, or plant sources; and consume a diet high in fruits, vegetables, nuts, and whole grains and low in refined grain products. However, simply lowering the percentage of energy from total fat in the diet is unlikely to improve lipid profile or reduce CHD incidence. Many issues remain unsettled, including the optimal amounts of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, the optimal balance between omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fats, the amount and sources of protein, and the effects of individual phytochemicals, antioxidant vitamins, and minerals.

Conclusions

Substantial evidence indicates that diets using nonhydrogenated unsaturated fats as the predominant form of dietary fat, whole grains as the main form of carbohydrates, an abundance of fruits and vegetables, and adequate omega-3 fatty acids can offer significant protection against CHD. Such diets, together with regular physical activity, avoidance of smoking, and maintenance of a healthy body weight, may prevent the majority of cardiovascular disease in Western populations.

### Relation of omega-3 fatty acid intake to other dietary factors known to reduce coronary heart disease risk [^b729a887]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Data supporting the inverse correlation of fish or long-chain omega-3 fatty acid (FA) (eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid) supplement consumption and coronary heart disease are inconclusive and may be confounded by other dietary and lifestyle factors. Using the Diabetic Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) database (n = 1,441), correlations between consumption of omega-3 FAs and saturated FAs to dietary variables (kilocalories, macronutrients, sodium, and cholesterol) and to age, gender, exercise level, and tobacco use were tested using Pearson correlation coefficients. Long-chain omega-3 FA intake inversely correlated with consumption of calories (r = -0.16, p < 0.0001), percent calories from total fat (r = -0.14, p < 0.0001), and percent calories from saturated FAs (r = -0.21, p < 0.0001) and directly with dietary fiber intake (grams per 1,000 kcal, r = 0.20, p < 0.0001). In the DCCT database, long-chain omega-3 FAs (i.e., fish consumption) inversely correlated with an overall low risk nutritional profile for coronary heart disease. In conclusion, these findings provide evidence that associations observed in studies suggesting a benefit of fish or long-chain omega-3 FAs may be due to a convergence of greater fish intakes with an overall healthier dietary pattern rather than with a specific effect of long-chain omega-3 FAs.

### Effect of omega-3 fatty acids on cardiovascular outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^cf0e59a8]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

A total of 20 trials (n = 125,611) reported 2989 non-fatal MI events, and 29 trials (n = 144,384) reported 9153 CHD events. Omega-3 FA was associated with reducing non-fatal MI (-2.7 incident cases per 1000 person-years [-3.9, -1.4]; RR, 0.87 [0.81–0.93]; p = 0.0001; moderate certainty; Fig. 3) and CHD (-1.9 incident cases per 1000 person-years [-2.7, -0.8]; RR, 0.91 [0.87–0.96]; p = 0.0002; moderate certainty; Fig. 4). Meta-analysis showed higher risk reductions in non-fatal MI with EPA monotherapy (RR: 0.72 [0.62–0.84]; p = 0.00002) than EPA+DHA combination (RR: 0.92 [0.85–1.00]; p = 0.05) as well as for CHD events with EPA monotherapy (RR: 0.73 [0.62–0.85]; p = 0.00004) than EPA+DHA combination (RR: 0.94 [0.89–0.99]; p = 0.01) (p for interaction for both endpoints = 0.01).

### Associations of omega-3 fatty acid supplement use with cardiovascular disease risks: meta-analysis of 10 trials involving 77 917 individuals [^7c8896a8]. JAMA Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

The present meta-analysis reported weak evidence of heterogeneity between the results of open-label vs blind trials for any CHD. This may reflect reporting bias, chance, or greater compliance in the open-label trials than in the blinded trials.

Previous meta-analyses of omega-3 FA trials, which were limited by being incomplete, including trials of dietary advice to increase fish consumption, or failure to distinguish the effects on a wide range of subtypes of CVD. In contrast, the present meta-analysis demonstrated that omega-3 FA supplementation had no significant effect on fatal CHD or any other CVD subtypes. Moreover, the conclusions of the present meta-analysis are consistent with those of a 2016 reportfor the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality that also involved study-level data from the same 10 large trials for prevention of major vascular events, and concluded that omega-3 FA supplementation had no association with the risk of major vascular events, all-cause mortality, sudden cardiac death, or revascularization. In contrast with this report, the present article was able to assess effects on a wide range of subtypes of CVD and on major vascular events in all relevant subgroups.

### Effect of omega-3 fatty acids on cardiovascular outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d873a9f9]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The effects of omega-3 fatty acids (FAs), such as eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids, on cardiovascular outcomes are uncertain. We aimed to determine the effectiveness of omega-3 FAs on fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular outcomes and examine the potential variability in EPA vs. EPA+DHA treatment effects.

Methods

We searched EMBASE, PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane library databases through June 7, 2021. We performed a meta-analysis of 38 randomized controlled trials of omega-3 FAs, stratified by EPA monotherapy and EPA+DHA therapy. We estimated random-effects rate ratios (RRs) with (95% confidence intervals) and rated the certainty of evidence using GRADE. The key outcomes of interest were cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal cardiovascular outcomes, bleeding, and atrial fibrillation (AF). The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021227580).

Findings

In 149,051 participants, omega-3 FA was associated with reducing cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.93 [0.88–0.98]; p = 0.01), non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) (RR, 0.87 [0.81–0.93]; p = 0.0001), coronary heart disease events (CHD) (RR, 0.91 [0.87–0.96]; p = 0.0002), major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (RR, 0.95 [0.92–0.98]; p = 0.002), and revascularization (RR, 0.91 [0.87–0.95]; p = 0.0001). The meta-analysis showed higher RR reductions with EPA monotherapy (0.82 [0.68–0.99]) than with EPA + DHA (0.94 [0.89–0.99]) for cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal MI (EPA: 0.72 [0.62–0.84]; EPA+DHA: 0.92 [0.85–1.00]), CHD events (EPA: 0.73 [0.62–0.85]; EPA+DHA: 0.94 [0.89–0.99]), as well for MACE and revascularization. Omega-3 FA increased incident AF (RR, 1.26 [1.08–1.48]). EPA monotherapy vs. control was associated with a higher risk of total bleeding (RR: 1.49 [1.20–1.84]) and AF (RR, 1.35 [1.10–1.66]).

Interpretation

Omega-3 FAs reduced cardiovascular mortality and improved cardiovascular outcomes. The cardiovascular risk reduction was more prominent with EPA monotherapy than with EPA+DHA.

Funding

None.

### New insights into the health effects of dietary saturated and omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids [^aae025dc]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

These data should help identify the optimal dietary fatty acid profile to reduce the risk and the complications of CVD. Thus, maintaining high or increasing - as proposed by certain experts - the intake of omega-6 in lieu of SFAs is definitely not the optimal strategy to prevent CVD complications.

### Omega-3 fatty acids for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^4f61e004]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from oily fish (long-chain omega-3 (LCn3)), including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)), as well as from plants (alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)) may benefit cardiovascular health. Guidelines recommend increasing omega-3-rich foods, and sometimes supplementation, but recent trials have not confirmed this.

Objectives

To assess the effects of increased intake of fish- and plant-based omega-3 fats for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events, adiposity and lipids.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase to February 2019, plus ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry to August 2019, with no language restrictions. We handsearched systematic review references and bibliographies and contacted trial authors.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that lasted at least 12 months and compared supplementation or advice to increase LCn3 or ALA intake, or both, versus usual or lower intake.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed validity. We performed separate random-effects meta-analysis for ALA and LCn3 interventions, and assessed dose-response relationships through meta-regression.

Main Results

We included 86 RCTs (162,796 participants) in this review update and found that 28 were at low summary risk of bias. Trials were of 12 to 88 months' duration and included adults at varying cardiovascular risk, mainly in high-income countries. Most trials assessed LCn3 supplementation with capsules, but some used LCn3- or ALA-rich or enriched foods or dietary advice compared to placebo or usual diet. LCn3 doses ranged from 0.5 g a day to more than 5 g a day (19 RCTs gave at least 3 g LCn3 daily). Meta-analysis and sensitivity analyses suggested little or no effect of increasing LCn3 on all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.01; 143,693 participants; 11,297 deaths in 45 RCTs; high-certainty evidence), cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.99; 117,837 participants; 5658 deaths in 29 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence), cardiovascular events (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.01; 140,482 participants; 17,619 people experienced events in 43 RCTs; high-certainty evidence), stroke (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.12; 138,888 participants; 2850 strokes in 31 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence) or arrhythmia (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.06; 77,990 participants; 4586 people experienced arrhythmia in 30 RCTs; low-certainty evidence). Increasing LCn3 may slightly reduce coronary heart disease mortality (number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 334, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.00; 127,378 participants; 3598 coronary heart disease deaths in 24 RCTs, low-certainty evidence) and coronary heart disease events (NNTB 167, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.97; 134,116 participants; 8791 people experienced coronary heart disease events in 32 RCTs, low-certainty evidence). Overall, effects did not differ by trial duration or LCn3 dose in pre-planned subgrouping or meta-regression. There is little evidence of effects of eating fish. Increasing ALA intake probably makes little or no difference to all-cause mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.20; 19,327 participants; 459 deaths in 5 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence), cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.25; 18,619 participants; 219 cardiovascular deaths in 4 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence), coronary heart disease mortality (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.26; 18,353 participants; 193 coronary heart disease deaths in 3 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence) and coronary heart disease events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.22; 19,061 participants; 397 coronary heart disease events in 4 RCTs; low-certainty evidence). However, increased ALA may slightly reduce risk of cardiovascular disease events (NNTB 500, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.07; but RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.04 in RCTs at low summary risk of bias; 19,327 participants; 884 cardiovascular disease events in 5 RCTs; low-certainty evidence), and probably slightly reduces risk of arrhythmia (NNTB 91, RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.97; 4912 participants; 173 events in 2 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence). Effects on stroke are unclear. Increasing LCn3 and ALA had little or no effect on serious adverse events, adiposity, lipids and blood pressure, except increasing LCn3 reduced triglycerides by ˜15% in a dose-dependent way (high-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

This is the most extensive systematic assessment of effects of omega-3 fats on cardiovascular health to date. Moderate- and low-certainty evidence suggests that increasing LCn3 slightly reduces risk of coronary heart disease mortality and events, and reduces serum triglycerides (evidence mainly from supplement trials). Increasing ALA slightly reduces risk of cardiovascular events and arrhythmia.

### Secondary prevention of coronary artery disease with omega-3 fatty acids [^bb31624b]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Omega-3 fatty acid therapy is a promising intervention for the secondary prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD). Omega-3 fatty acids have properties that promote atherosclerotic plaque stability and decrease the incidence of ischemia-driven cardiac arrhythmias. A large number of clinical trials conducted in patients with CAD or prior myocardial infarction (MI) have examined hard cardiovascular end points, including total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, sudden death, and nonfatal MI. Several intermediate cardiovascular end-point studies have also examined whether ventricular arrhythmias can be suppressed in patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). Significant reductions in total mortality and sudden death — 20% to 50% — have been found in studies using doses of 0.85 to 4.0 g/day, with treatment durations from 12 to 42 months. Favorable trends toward reduction in the incidence of arrhythmic events have been demonstrated in some, but not all, ICD studies. Omega-3 fatty acid therapy shows a general positive trend toward benefit in reducing life-threatening events after MI and in patients with ICDs who have ischemic arrhythmias. Results of the recent Japan EPA Lipid Intervention Study (JELIS) in a large cohort (N = 18,645) of Japanese men and women suggest significant benefits in the reduction of unstable angina and nonfatal coronary events. The totality of evidence supports a strong role for omega-3 fatty acids derived from fish oil in secondary prevention through a presumptive role as an antiarrhythmic agent and through an ability to promote plaque stabilization.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to supplements, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend to do not offer nonprescription or dietary supplements, including omega-3 fatty acid, vitamins C, D, E, β-carotene, and calcium to reduce the risk of acute CVD events in patients with chronic coronary disease.

### Dietary fat and cardiovascular disease risk: quantity or quality? [^f4931b97]. Journal of Women's Health (2003). Low credibility.

When considering dietary fat quantity, there are two main factors to consider, impact on body weight and plasma lipoprotein profiles. Data supporting a major role of dietary fat quantity in determining body weight are weak and may be confounded by differences in energy density, dietary fiber, and dietary protein. With respect to plasma lipoprotein profiles, relatively consistent evidence indicates that under isoweight conditions, decreasing the total fat content of the diet causes an increase in triglyceride and decrease in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. When considering dietary fat quality, current evidence suggests that saturated fatty acids tend to increase low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, whereas monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids tend to decrease LDL cholesterol levels. Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (22:6n-3), are associated with decreased triglyceride levels in hypertriglyceridemic patients and decreased risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD). Dietary trans-fatty acids are associated with increased LDL cholesterol levels. Hence, a diet low in saturated and trans-fatty acids, with adequate amounts of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, would be recommended to reduce the risk of developing CHD. Additionally, the current data suggest it is necessary to go beyond dietary fat, regardless of whether the emphasis is on quantity or quality, and consider lifestyle. This would include encouraging abstinence from smoking, habitual physical activity, avoidance of weight gain with age, and responsible limited alcohol intake (one drink for females and two drinks for males per day).

### The role of eicosapentaenoic acid in reducing important cardiovascular events, including coronary revascularization [^aa0d90c1]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid has an important role in human health. The Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl-Intervention Trial (REDUCE-IT) examined the prescription omega-3 fatty acid icosapent ethyl (IPE) in patients with established cardiovascular disease (CVD) or with diabetes plus additional CVD risk factors. The trial found a large reduction in CVD events, including significant reductions in CVD death, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, and hospitalization for unstable angina. These results led to the regulatory approval of IPE in a population similar to REDUCE-IT participants in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and the European Union. Moreover, multiple international guidelines have endorsed the use of IPE in such individuals. A secondary analysis of REDUCE-IT examined the endpoint of coronary artery revascularization. This analysis showed a significant reduction not only in coronary revascularization overall but also in elective, urgent, and emergent coronary revascularization. Additionally, IPE significantly reduced the need for both percutaneous coronary intervention and for coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Coronary imaging studies have demonstrated significant decreases in rates of plaque progression with IPE, with significant effects within 6–9 months. In parallel, experimental findings corroborate several effects of IPE that provide mechanisms that could contribute to the profound reductions in multiple types of ischemic events, including percutaneous and surgical coronary revascularization. Future trials should explore potential benefits of initiation of IPE at the time of revascularization in broader populations, potentially in conjunction with loading doses.

### Seafood long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and cardiovascular disease: a science advisory from the American Heart Association [^d7d54522]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Since the 2002 American Heart Association scientific statement "Fish Consumption, Fish Oil, Omega-3 Fatty Acids, and Cardiovascular Disease", evidence from observational and experimental studies and from randomized controlled trials continues to emerge to further substantiate the beneficial effects of seafood long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and cardiovascular disease. A recent American Heart Association science advisory addressed the specific effect of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation on clinical cardiovascular events. This American Heart Association science advisory extends that review and offers further support to include n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from seafood consumption. Several potential mechanisms have been investigated, including antiarrhythmic, anti-inflammatory, hematologic, and endothelial, although for most, longer-term dietary trials of seafood are warranted to substantiate the benefit of seafood as a replacement for other important sources of macronutrients. The present science advisory reviews this evidence and makes a suggestion in the context of the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and in consideration of other constituents of seafood and the impact on sustainability. We conclude that 1 to 2 seafood meals per week be included to reduce the risk of congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and sudden cardiac death, especially when seafood replaces the intake of less healthy foods.

### Emerging mechanisms of cardiovascular protection for the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid [^1145b4cd]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

High-Dose Omega-3 Fatty Acid Treatment and Residual Cardiovascular Risk

Despite the success of LDL (low-density lipoprotein)-lowering therapies in reducing cardiovascular risk, individuals with well-controlled LDL still have residual cardiovascular risk associated in part with elevated triglycerides. The REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl–Intervention Trial) that tested an omega-3 fatty acid (n3-FA)-based therapy of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) demonstrated cardiovascular risk reduction in addition to the protection afforded by statins. REDUCE-IT demonstrated that a highly purified ethyl ester of EPA, icosapent ethyl, significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization in at-risk patients with triglycerides above ≈100 mg/dL despite being treated with statins. – First ischemic events fell by 25% (P = 0.00000001) and total (first and subsequent) ischemic events by 31% (P = 0.0000000004), with consistent benefits across multiple prespecified subgroups, including primary and secondary prevention. The prespecified subgroup of 3146 patients randomized in the United States demonstrated benefits at least as robust as the overall population, with a notable 30% lower rate of mortality (P = 0.004) in those randomized to icosapent ethyl. The EPA treatment used yielded consistent benefits across baseline levels of triglycerides as well, including in the ≈10% of participants with normal triglycerides.

The large relative and absolute risk reductions in several different types of end points from REDUCE-IT seemed to exceed that expected by the degree of triglyceride lowering, suggesting that other properties of EPA likely contribute to the benefits, as will be discussed – (Figure 1). Beyond the effect on lowering triglyceride levels, EPA has cell-membrane stabilizing properties that may explain, in part, the significant reductions seen in death from cardiovascular causes (20% reduction), sudden cardiac death (31% reduction), and cardiac arrest (48% reduction). Of note, the results of REDUCE-IT apply to a broad population of at-risk patients. The findings from REDUCE-IT contrast sharply with previous outcome trials that showed no cardiovascular benefit using EPA/docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) combinations or dietary supplements that may contain oxidized fatty acids and saturated fat. – Further trials with high-dose n3-FAs in various groups will provide additional insight into this question.

### Tissue omega-6 / omega-3 fatty acid ratio and risk for coronary artery disease [^da431d48]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

A ratio that estimates tissue proportions of omega-6 fatty acids (linoleic acid and/or arachidonic acid [AA]) and omega-3 fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA], docosahexaenoic acid [DHA], and/or alpha-linolenic acid) has been proposed as a biomarker of risk for coronary artery disease (CAD). Use of an omega-6/omega-3 fatty acid ratio instead of either fatty acid class alone is based on theoretical reasons and has not been validated. The relationship between risk for CAD events and tissue omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid composition was evaluated by pooling data from case-control or prospective cohort studies that examined the risk for CAD end points as a function of tissue fatty acid composition. Thirteen studies were included, 11 case-control and 2 prospective cohort studies, and case-control differences in computed averages of several fatty acids and fatty acid ratios were compared. The largest and most consistent difference was for the sum of EPA + DHA (-11% in cases, p = 0.002). Proportions of EPA, DHA, and AA were about 8% lower in cases, but none of these differences was significant. Total omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids were lower by 7% and 4%, respectively, in cases versus controls, but only the total omega-3 fatty acid difference was significant. The AA/EPA ratio was nonsignificantly lower by 10% in cases. Fatty acid ratios generally failed to distinguish cases from controls, and any discriminatory power they had derived from the omega-3 fatty acid component. Tissue EPA + DHA appears to be the best fatty acid metric for evaluating for CAD risk.

### Is there a role for omega-3 fatty acids in cardiovascular disease risk reduction? [^87b92906]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

A recent meta-analysis published in EClinicalMedicine examined the effectiveness of omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), on cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. Mixed EPA/DHA formulations were indicated to have moderate certainty in reducing CV mortality and outcomes. Greater relative reductions in incident CV events were observed with EPA alone trials. The authors conclude that EPA and DHA have inherently different physico-chemical properties that influence CV risk reduction.

Our concern is that the authors assert mixed EPA/DHA formulations remain a viable treatment to reduce CV risk in patients using contemporary care. This conclusion is derived from a meta-analysis disproportinately influenced by older trials conducted without broad statin use. In particular, the large GISSI-P and GISSI-HF trials enrolled subjects with 5% and 23% on statins, respectively (Table 1). By contrast, STRENGTH tested an EPA/DHA formulation (4 g/d) in patients on maximum statin treatment and terminated early for futility. Similarly, the OMEMI trial failed to meet its primary endpoint when EPA/DHA (1.8 g/d) was combined with high statin use (Table). Like other TG-lowering agents (e.g. fibrates, niacin), mixed EPA/DHA treatments do not add incremental benefit in risk reduction on top of statins. The benefits of icosapent ethyl (IPE) are attributed to dose, formulation and direct effects of EPA on inflammation, platelet activity and endothelial function beyond changes in lipoprotein levels.

Table 1
Cardiovascular outcome trials with omega-3 fatty acids since 1999.

We recommend that the authors repeat the meta-analysis after removing older trials performed without broad statin use to ascertain a potential role for omega-3 fatty acids as part of contemporary medical therapy in CV patients.

### Triglycerides, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular outcome studies: focus on omega-3 fatty acids [^50619aac]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an overview of the roles of triglycerides and triglyceride-lowering agents in atherosclerosis in the context of cardiovascular outcomes studies.

Methods

We reviewed the published literature as well as ClinicalTrials.gov entries for ongoing studies.

Results

Despite improved atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) outcomes with statin therapy, residual risk remains. Epidemiologic data and recent genetic insights provide compelling evidence that triglycerides are in the causal pathway for the development of atherosclerosis, thereby renewing interest in targeting triglycerides to improve ASCVD outcomes. Fibrates, niacin, and omega-3 fatty acids (OM3FAs) are three classes of triglyceride-lowering drugs. Outcome studies with triglyceride-lowering agents have been inconsistent. With regard to OM3FAs, the JELIS study showed that eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) significantly reduced major coronary events in statin-treated hypercholesterolemic patients. Regarding other agents, extended-release niacin and fenofibrate are no longer recommended as statin add-on therapy (by some guidelines, though not all) because of the lack of convincing evidence from outcome studies. Notably, subgroup analyses from the outcome studies have generated the hypothesis that triglyceride lowering may provide benefit in statin-treated patients with persistent hypertriglyceridemia. Two ongoing OM3FA outcome studies (REDUCE-IT and STRENGTH) are testing this hypothesis in high-risk, statin-treated patients with triglyceride levels of 200 to 500 mg/dL.

Conclusion

There is consistent evidence that triglycerides are in the causal pathway of atherosclerosis but inconsistent evidence from cardiovascular outcomes studies as to whether triglyceride-lowering agents reduce cardiovascular risk. Ongoing outcomes studies will determine the role of triglyceride lowering in statin-treated patients with high-dose prescription OM3FAs in terms of improved ASCVD outcomes.

### Omega-3 fatty acids in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases [^c7d38072]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Even with substantial progress in primary and secondary prevention, cardiovascular disease (CVD) persists as a major cause of mortality and morbidity globally. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (Ω-3 PUFAs) have gained considerable attention for their ability to improve CV health and prognosis. Metanalyses of randomized controlled trials have demonstrated Ω-3 PUFAs' positive impact on CVD outcomes for both primary and secondary prevention endpoints. Marine Ω-3 PUFAs also improve CVD risk factors including blood pressure, lipids, and inflammation; however, many physicians do not recommend Ω-3 PUFAs, largely due to inconsistent results in randomized trials. In this comprehensive review article, we evaluate both historic and current data concerning primary and secondary prevention of CVD with use of Ω-3 PUFAs, delve into the potential causes for the varied results, and examine the most current recommendations on the usage of Ω-3 PUFAs.

### Omega-3 fatty acids and CHD prevention… [^f865574a]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Mounting evidence shows that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids prevent cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction. The types of PUFAs that have been most often studied include eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and α-linolenic acid. The omega-3 PUFAs are probably cardioprotective through several mechanisms. They have antiarrhythmic and antithrombotic effects, and improve endothelial function. Atherosclerotic plaque formation has been shown to be inhibited by ingestion of EPA and DHA. Total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations are lowered with consumption of fish oil without a drop in high-density lipoprotein levels. Working mostly through anti-atherogenic effects, it is mainly the marine-derived PUFAs, EPA, and DHA that have the clearest value. The benefit of ALA needs further clarification. Prospective trials have confirmed the benefit of PUFAs on CHD.

In a large prospective study, men who had recovered from a myocardial infarction and were assigned to eat fish or take fish oil capsules had a significant decrease in all-cause mortality. A prospective study of a Cretan Mediterranean diet, high in fruits and vegetables, rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, and high in ALA, among a population who had survived a first myocardial infarction, demonstrated a significant reduction of risk for cardiovascular death and nonfatal myocardial infarction. Other prospective diet-based studies have demonstrated similar beneficial results. The authors conclude that PUFAs are useful in secondary prevention of CHD. In the U. S. diet, the principal sources of PUFAs are vegetable oils and fish. Guidelines recommend increased consumption of ALA, EPA, and DHA. For persons who cannot tolerate an increase in fish to one to two fish meals per week, supplements are available, including a vegetarian source derived from algae. editor's note: The cardioprotective value of omega-3 fatty acids is becoming more widely accepted. Data tell us that the type of fat is more important than the total amount of fat in the diet. Replacing saturated fat with unsaturated fat is more effective in lowering CHD risk than simply reducing total fat intake. Clear evidence of reduced cardiac mortality has been demonstrated in studies using omega-3 fatty acids for secondary prevention of cardiac morbidity and mortality. Other potential benefits of consumption of fatty fish may include decreased risk of prostate cancer.

3.2 Fish oil omega‐3 PUFAs: Background of clinical studies

A 2011 review analyzed randomized controlled trials, prospective cohort studies, and meta‐analyses conducted up to that time and concluded that consumption of fish or fish oil reduced coronary heart disease mortality in populations with and without established CV disease. 40 Three meta‐analyses of randomized controlled trials of omega‐3 PUFA supplements supported this conclusion. 46, 74, 75 However, another meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials published in 2012 concluded that omega‐3 PUFA supplementation was not associated with significant reduction in the risk of all‐cause death, cardiac death, or myocardial infarction. 76 That meta‐analysis, however, used an unusually high threshold for statistical significance (α = 0.0063). It is remarkable, for example, that all 17 of the trials included in the analysis of all‐cause death reported a relative risk < 0.96 favoring omega‐3 PUFA, and seven of those trials reported upper confidence intervals that were < 1.0, yet the meta‐analysis failed to find a significant benefit of omega‐3 PUFAs for all‐cause death. The authors noted that there was extensive heterogeneity across trials with regard to event rates, baseline CV disease risk, treatment setting (eg, primary prevention vs secondary prevention), co‐administered therapies, baseline intake of omega‐3 PUFAs, dose, and nature of omega‐3 PUFA used for the intervention, and treatment adherence. Thus, heterogeneity was likely so high that a meaningful conclusion could not be reached. A more recent meta‐analysis revealed the importance of such heterogeneity. That study 77 also found a non‐significant reduction in coronary heart disease risk across the entire study group (summary relative risk estimate [SSRE], 0.94; 95% CI 0.85‐1.05), but it found that high‐risk populations obtained significant benefits from omega‐3 PUFA interventions. Specifically, patients with elevated baseline TG levels had an SSRE of 0.86 (95% CI 0.76‐0.98). The authors also found evidence that higher intakes of omega‐3 PUFAs were associated with significantly greater reductions in coronary heart disease risk (SSRE, 0.82; 95% CI 0.74‐0.92). These meta‐analyses reinforce the importance of trial design; patient subgroups should be carefully and prospectively defined and studied in clinical trials, and doses and compositions of omega‐3 PUFAs need to be precisely constructed and controlled.

### Effect of omega-3 fatty acids on cardiovascular outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3b2eeb1b]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

A total of 17 trials (n = 135,019) reported 13,234 events of MACE, and 13 trials (n = 117,890) reported 7416 events of revascularization. Omega-3 FA was associated with reducing MACE (-1.0 incident cases per 1000 person-years; RR, 0.95 [0.92–0.98]; p = 0.002; moderate certainty; Appendix p 16) and revascularization (-1.9 incident cases per 1000 person-years [-2.7, -1.0]; RR, 0.91 [0.87–0.95]; p = 0.0001; moderate certainty; Appendix p 17). Meta-analysis showed higher risk reductions in MACE with EPA monotherapy (RR: 0.78 [0.71–0.85]; p = 0.00000001), while EPA+DHA combination did not reduce MACE (RR: 0.99 [0.95–1.02]; p = 0.48) (p for interaction = 0.000005). This effect was consistent for revascularization.

### Effect of omega-3 fatty acids on cardiovascular outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f59002a1]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Two studies in 2020, STRENGTH (the Long-Term Outcomes Study to Assess Statin Residual Risk with Epanova in High Cardiovascular Risk Patients with Hypertriglyceridemia)and OMEMI (the Omega-3 fatty acids in Elderly with Myocardial Infarction), showed null results for combined EPA+DHA therapy on the primary endpoints (STRENGTH: composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI, nonfatal stroke, emergent/elective coronary revascularization, or unstable angina requiring hospitalization, OMEMI: non-fatal MI, unscheduled revascularization, stroke or all-cause mortality). These discordant trial results have led to considerable uncertainty and debate about the potential role of omega-3 FAs in reducing ASCVD residual risk. Moreover, since EPA and DHA differ in their biological effects on membrane structure and lipid metabolism, this variability led to the hypothesis that combining DHA with the EPA might partially offset the beneficial clinical effects of EPA treatment alone. To explore this potential clinical heterogeneity across omega-3 FAs trials, we performed an updated systematic review and meta-analysis with a primary focus on determining the effectiveness and safety of omega-3 FAs on fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular outcomes in adults. The secondary focus was on examining the potential variability in the effects generated by EPA vs. EPA+DHA treatment.

### Associations of omega-3 fatty acid supplement use with cardiovascular disease risks: meta-analysis of 10 trials involving 77 917 individuals [^fcc69c61]. JAMA Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

The reasons for the discrepant results of the previous trials of omega-3 FA supplementation on fatal and nonfatal CHD events are unclear. In contrast with the null findings for most trials, the GISSI-Prevenzione trialreported a 14% reduction in major vascular events, chiefly owing to an 11% reduction in cardiac deaths. But the JELIS trial reported a 19% (95% CI, 5%-31%) reduction in major CHD events (albeit based on only 586 events), chiefly owing to a reduction in nonfatal CHD events. It is unclear whether differences in inclusion criteria for prior diseases, concomitant use of statins, or other secondary prevention treatments may explain some of the conflicting results of individual trials.

For example, previous reports had suggested that the effects of omega-3 FA use may vary by patients' prior use of statin medications. The Alpha Omega trial reported that use of low-dose omega-3 FAs reduced the risk of major vascular events in patients with prior MI who were not treated with statin medications. However, the present meta-analysis demonstrated no heterogeneity in the effects of omega-3 FA supplementation on CHD death or nonfatal MI between the individual trials and reported no differences in the effects of omega-3 FAs on major vascular events by subgroups of those with or without prior cardiovascular disease or diabetes; those with lipid levels less than or greater than specified cutoff points; or those who had histories of statin therapy. The results of the present meta-analysis were also unaltered by the exclusion of the JELIS trial, in which all participants were also treated with statin medications.

### Recent findings on the health effects of omega-3 fatty acids and statins, and their interactions: do statins inhibit omega-3? [^36ee92e6]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Until 2005, studies consistently provided clear evidence that omega-3 fatty acids (n-3) protect against cardiovascular diseases (CVD) complications. They were thought to reduce the risk of arterial atherosclerotic and thrombotic obstruction; to increase the myocardial resistance to ischemia-reperfusion injury; and to prevent malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Animal and epidemiological studies as well as randomized controlled trials (RCTs) all supported that n-3 are protective. This was confirmed in meta-analyses of both prospective cohort studies and RCTs leading to the conclusion that an intake of 250 mg/day of marine n-3 (EPA+DHA (eicosapentanoic acid + docosahexanoic acid)) reduced fatal CVD by 36% when compared to no EPA+DHA.

Consequently, it was proposed to use blood measurements of n-3 as a predictor of CVD complications. The omega-3 index - defined as the percentage of EPA+DHA in blood red cells - reflects the average dietary intake and the tissue levels of EPA+DHA, including those of the heart. A high omega-3 index (> 8%) is thought to be associated with a low risk of CVD complications whereas a low omega-3 index (< 4%) is associated with increased risk susceptible to be decreased by a preventive treatment with n-3 (fish oil) supplements. An omega-3 index between 4 and 8% indicates an intermediate risk. The effects of n-3 supplements are, therefore, expected to be different in patients with either high or low omega-3 index with large benefits for those with a low index (that is, high risk) and small or no benefits for those with a high index (that is, low risk). This concept is critical because it suggests that n-3 supplements might be potentially protective against CVD complications only in patients who are n-3 deficient and not in patients who are at high risk for reasons other than an n-3 deficiency. This underlines the fact that n-3 are nutrients and not a drug. So far this concept applies only for CVD, not for other nonvascular and non-cardiac clinical conditions.

### Vitamin D, marine n-3 fatty acids, and primary prevention of cardiovascular disease current evidence [^774ac382]. Circulation Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Whether marine omega-3 fatty acid (n-3 FA) or vitamin D supplementation can prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD) in general populations at usual risk for this outcome is unknown. A major goal of VITAL (Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial) was to fill this knowledge gap. In this article, we review the results of VITAL, discuss relevant mechanistic studies regarding n-3 FAs, vitamin D, and vascular disease, and summarize recent meta-analyses of the randomized trial evidence on these agents. VITAL was a nationwide, randomized, placebo-controlled, 2×2 factorial trial of marine n-3 FAs (1 g/d) and vitamin D 3 (2000 IU/d) in the primary prevention of CVD and cancer among 25871 US men aged ≥ 50 and women aged ≥ 55 years, including 5106 blacks. Median treatment duration was 5.3 years. Supplemental n-3 FAs did not significantly reduce the primary cardiovascular end point of major CVD events (composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, and CVD mortality; hazard ratio [HR], 0.92 [95% CI, 0.80–1.06]) but were associated with significant reductions in total myocardial infarction (HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.59–0.90]), percutaneous coronary intervention (HR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.63–0.95]), and fatal myocardial infarction (HR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.26–0.97]) but not stroke or other cardiovascular end points. For major CVD events, a treatment benefit was seen in those with dietary fish intake below the cohort median of 1.5 servings/wk (HR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.67–0.98]) but not in those above (P interaction = 0.045). For myocardial infarction, the greatest risk reductions were in blacks (HR, 0.23 [95% CI, 0.11–0.47]; P interaction by race, 0.001). Vitamin D supplementation did not reduce major CVD events (HR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.85–1.12]) or other cardiovascular end points. Updated meta-analyses that include VITAL and other recent trials document coronary risk reduction from supplemental marine n-3 FAs but no clear CVD risk reduction from supplemental vitamin D. Additional research is needed to determine which individuals may be most likely to derive net benefit from supplementation. Clinical Trial Registration: URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

### Cardiovascular, electrophysiologic, and hematologic effects of omega-3 fatty acids beyond reducing hypertriglyceridemia: as it pertains to the recently published REDUCE-IT trial [^62c50294]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The decline in coronary artery disease (CAD)-related mortality over the last four to five decades was regarded as a major breakthrough; however, multiple rebutting reports from recent years that demonstrate an increasing trend towards higher mortality rates from CAD in specified patient populations exist. Despite advancements in prevention and treatment strategies, current data illustrate that heart disease accounts for a quarter of all deaths in the United States.

Omega-3 fatty acids are not commonly utilized in the clinical setting because of the lack of uniform evidence of their ability to reduce the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events. The Cochrane group reported similar findings, demonstrating no significant benefit. The lack of evidence has led physicians away from recommending omega-3 fatty acids and towards dietary modifications, exercise, and weight loss. By contrast, Yokoyama et al. reported that eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) significantly reduces major adverse cardiovascular events by 19% when used for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. The recently published landmark REDUCE-IT trial examined the use of EPA in addition to statin therapy in patients with hypertriglyceridemia to further explore its role in the appropriate clinical setting.

Multiple factors associated with omega-3 fatty acids and inconsistent results of published studies have been reported, which include, but are not limited to, dosage, preparation, studied population, clinical setting (primary vs. secondary prevention), and background therapy. Furthermore, their cellular mechanism of action and how they produce their clinical effects are not commonly discussed. Thus, in this discussion, we aimed to review the composition of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, their multiple pharmaco–physiologic pathways, and their resultant effects on the cardiovascular system.

### N-3 fatty acids and cardiovascular disease [^66057921]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

The results of prospective cohort studies indicate that consuming fish or fish oil containing the n-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is associated with decreased cardiovascular death, whereas consumption of the vegetable oil-derived n-3 fatty acid a-linolenic acid is not as effective. Randomized control trials (RCTs) in the context of secondary prevention also indicate that the consumption of EPA plus DHA is protective at doses < 1 g/d. The therapeutic effect appears to be due to suppression of fatal arrhythmias rather than stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques. At doses > 3 g/d, EPA plus DHA can improve cardiovascular disease risk factors, including decreasing plasma triacylglycerols, blood pressure, platelet aggregation, and inflammation, while improving vascular reactivity. Mainly on the basis of the results of RCTs, the American Heart Association recommends that everyone eat oily fish twice per week and that those with coronary heart disease eat 1 g/d of EPA plus DHA from oily fish or supplements. Directions for future research include (1) RCTs to confirm the initial trials showing that EPA plus DHA decreases cardiovascular death and additional studies to determine whether this effect is due to EPA, DHA, or the combination; the dosage of the effective components; and whether the mechanism of action in humans is prevention of fatal arrhythmias. (2) Clinical studies to determine whether the reduction in cardiovascular disease risk factors is due to EPA, DHA, or the combination and the dosage of the effective components. (3) Clinical studies to determine whether vegetable oil-derived alpha-linolenic acid added to a diet enriched in n-6 fatty acids can effectively substitute for fish oil-derived EPA plus DHA.

### Omega 3 fatty acids and cardiovascular outcomes: systematic review and meta-analysis [^5bc892d3]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Early trials evaluating the effect of omega 3 fatty acids (ω-3 FA) reported benefits for mortality and cardiovascular events but recent larger studies trials have variable findings. We assessed the effects of ω-3 FA on cardiovascular and other important clinical outcomes.

Methods and Results

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for all randomized studies using dietary supplements, dietary interventions, or both. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular events (mostly myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death). Secondary outcomes were arrhythmia, cerebrovascular events, hemorrhagic stroke, ischemic stroke, coronary revascularization, heart failure, total mortality, nonvascular mortality, and end-stage kidney disease. Twenty studies including 63030 participants were included. There was no overall effect of ω-3 FA on composite cardiovascular events (relative risk [RR] = 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90–1.03; P = 0.24) or on total mortality (RR = 0.95; 95% CI, 0.86–1.04; P = 0.28). ω-3 FA did protect against vascular death (RR = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75–0.99; P = 0.03) but not coronary events (RR = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.67–1.11; P = 0.24). There was no effect on arrhythmia (RR = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.85–1.16; P = 0.92) or cerebrovascular events (RR = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.92–1.16; P = 0.59). Adverse events were more common in the treatment group than the placebo group (RR = 1.18, 95% CI, 1.02–1.37; P = 0.03), predominantly because of an excess of gastrointestinal side effects.

Conclusions

ω-3 FA may protect against vascular disease, but the evidence is not clear-cut, and any benefits are almost certainly not as great as previously believed.

### Associations of omega-3 fatty acid supplement use with cardiovascular disease risks: meta-analysis of 10 trials involving 77 917 individuals [^33ecfce4]. JAMA Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This meta-analysis had several limitations. The protocol did not prespecify assessment of the effects of treatment by smoking status or by site-specific cancer incidence. An additional limitation of this meta-analysis involved the use of aggregated study-level data rather than individual-level data. A meta-analysis of individual participant data may have a greater chance of detecting effects of omega-3 FA supplements on subtypes of fatal CHD events (ie, sudden death or ventricular arrhythmias) in a wider range of subgroups. However, the overall null results of the present meta-analysis, which assesses effects on a wide range of prespecified CVD subtypes, provides little encouragement for such an approach. In addition, sensitivity analyses using data from 1 trialthat also provided data on all individual participants indicated identical effect estimates and 99% CI for analyses using both O-E and log-rank methods.

The 95% CI in the present meta-analysis of 10 trials, involving 77 917 high-risk individuals, 12 001 major vascular events, and 6273 CHD events, cannot exclude a 7% lower risk of major vascular events and a 10% lower risk of CHD associated with omega-3 FA supplements. Several ongoing large randomized trials involving a total of 54 354 additional participants (A Study of Cardiovascular Events in Diabetes [ASCEND], n = 15 480; VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL [VITAL], n = 25 874; STatin Residual risk reduction with EpaNova in hiGh CV risk patienTs with Hypertriglyceridemia [STRENGTH], n = 13 000 and Reduction of Cardiovascular Events With EPA–Intervention Trial [REDUCE-IT], n = 8000) will provide additional evidence about the associations of omega-3 FA supplementation with the risk of major vascular events, any CHD, and subtypes of fatal and nonfatal CHD. Importantly, the STRENGTHand REDUCE-IT trials will test the effects on major vascular events of much higher doses of omega-3 FAs (3–4 g/d), which will lower plasma levels of triglycerides.

### Marine omega-3 supplementation and cardiovascular disease: an updated meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials involving 127 477 participants [^9e7ad5c8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background Whether marine omega-3 supplementation is associated with reduction in risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains controversial. Methods and Results This meta-analysis included study-level data from 13 trials. The outcomes of interest included myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease (CHD) death, total CHD, total stroke, CVD death, total CVD, and major vascular events. The unadjusted rate ratios were calculated using a fixed-effect meta-analysis. A meta-regression was conducted to estimate the dose-response relationship between marine omega-3 dosage and risk of each prespecified outcome. During a mean treatment duration of 5.0 years, 3838 myocardial infarctions, 3008 CHD deaths, 8435 total CHD events, 2683 strokes, 5017 CVD deaths, 15 759 total CVD events, and 16 478 major vascular events were documented. In the analysis excluding REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl-Intervention Trial), marine omega-3 supplementation was associated with significantly lower risk of myocardial infarction (rate ratio [RR] [95% CI]: 0.92 [0.86, 0.99]; P = 0.020), CHD death (RR [95% CI]: 0.92 [0.86, 0.98]; P = 0.014), total CHD (RR [95% CI]: 0.95 [0.91, 0.99]; P = 0.008), CVD death (RR [95% CI]: 0.93 [0.88, 0.99]; P = 0.013), and total CVD (RR [95% CI]: 0.97 [0.94, 0.99]; P = 0.015). Inverse associations for all outcomes were strengthened after including REDUCE-IT while introducing statistically significant heterogeneity. Statistically significant linear dose-response relationships were found for total CVD and major vascular events in the analyses with and without including REDUCE-IT. Conclusions Marine omega-3 supplementation lowers risk for myocardial infarction, CHD death, total CHD, CVD death, and total CVD, even after exclusion of REDUCE-IT. Risk reductions appeared to be linearly related to marine omega-3 dose.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^70fe5e6e]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) — primary prevention and intake guidance: Observational studies and some randomized clinical trials suggest that consumption of 250 to 550 mg/day of EPA and DHA is associated with a 36% lower risk of CHD death and reduced total mortality by 17%; pooled analyses also reported that approximately 566 mg/day (highest) versus lowest intake was associated with approximately a 37% reduction in CHD mortality. Dietary guidance notes that the 2010 DGA recommended 250 mg/day of EPA and DHA and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends 500 mg/day. DGAC 2010 concluded that consumption of two servings of seafood per week (4 oz per serving), which provide an average of 250 mg per day of long-chain n-3 fatty acids, is associated with reduced cardiac mortality and that two servings per week at 4 oz per serving is advised for high-risk (those with CVD) and average-risk persons; it further emphasizes seafood providing at least 250 mg of long-chain n-3 fatty acids per day. The American Heart Association included a primary dietary recommendation for fish: ≥ two 3.5-oz. servings per week (preferably oily fish).

### Effect of high-dose omega-3 fatty acids vs corn oil on major adverse cardiovascular events in patients at high cardiovascular risk: the STRENGTH randomized clinical trial [^f0d4b33a]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

It remains uncertain whether the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) reduce cardiovascular risk.

Objective

To determine the effects on cardiovascular outcomes of a carboxylic acid formulation of EPA and DHA (omega-3 CA) with documented favorable effects on lipid and inflammatory markers in patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia and high cardiovascular risk.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A double-blind, randomized, multicenter trial (enrollment October 30, 2014, to June 14, 2017; study termination January 8, 2020; last patient visit May 14, 2020) comparing omega-3 CA with corn oil in statin-treated participants with high cardiovascular risk, hypertriglyceridemia, and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). A total of 13 078 patients were randomized at 675 academic and community hospitals in 22 countries in North America, Europe, South America, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to receive 4 g/d of omega-3 CA (n = 6539) or corn oil, which was intended to serve as an inert comparator (n = 6539), in addition to usual background therapies, including statins.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy measure was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or unstable angina requiring hospitalization.

Results

When 1384 patients had experienced a primary end point event (of a planned 1600 events), the trial was prematurely halted based on an interim analysis that indicated a low probability of clinical benefit of omega-3 CA vs the corn oil comparator. Among the 13 078 treated patients (mean [SD] age, 62.5 [9.0] years; 35% women; 70% with diabetes; median low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol level, 75.0 mg/dL; median triglycerides level, 240 mg/dL; median HDL-C level, 36 mg/dL; and median high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level, 2.1 mg/L), 12 633 (96.6%) completed the trial with ascertainment of primary end point status. The primary end point occurred in 785 patients (12.0%) treated with omega-3 CA vs 795 (12.2%) treated with corn oil (hazard ratio, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.90–1.09]; P = 0.84). A greater rate of gastrointestinal adverse events was observed in the omega-3 CA group (24.7%) compared with corn oil-treated patients (14.7%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among statin-treated patients at high cardiovascular risk, the addition of omega-3 CA, compared with corn oil, to usual background therapies resulted in no significant difference in a composite outcome of major adverse cardiovascular events. These findings do not support use of this omega-3 fatty acid formulation to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events in high-risk patients.

### Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and cardiovascular health: a comprehensive review [^4d5dfdf8]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

The potential cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) benefits of Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (OM3) have been intensely studied and debated for decades. Initial trials were performed in patients with low use of maximal medical therapy for CVD, and reported significant mortality benefits with the use of 1 g/day OM3 intervention following myocardial infarction (MI). More recent studies, including cohorts of patients receiving modern guideline directed medical therapy for CVD, have often not shown similar benefits with OM3 use. We conducted a literature review using PubMed, professional society guidelines, specific journal databases including New England Journal of Medicine and Journal of the American College of Cardiology from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2017. References from selected articles were also reviewed, as well as key articles outside of the selected time-frame for their important findings or historical perspectives. Currently, there are no Class I recommendations from the American Heart Association (AHA) for the use of OM3, however, considering the safety of this therapy and beneficial findings of some modern studies (including patients with current maximal medical therapy for CVD), the AHA has recently expanded their list of Class II recommendations, in which treatment with OM3 for CVD benefit is reasonable. This review discusses the current state of the evidence, summarizes current professional recommendations, and provides recommendations for future research.

### Ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid biomarkers and coronary heart disease… [^991b6e6a]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Question Are seafood and plant-derived ω-3 fats related to first coronary heart disease events. Findings In a consortium of 19 studies, biomarkers of seafood and plant-derived ω-3 fats were associated with a significantly lower risk of fatal CHD. In contrast, associations with nonfatal myocardial infarction were generally less robust. Main Outcomes and Measures Incident total CHD, fatal CHD, and nonfatal myocardial infarction. Results. A review1 of experimental studies and randomized clinical trials revealed a protective effect of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on coronary heart disease risk pathways and clinical risk factors. However, key controversies remain. First, randomized clinical trials using fish oil supplements have found mixed effects on CHD events. 2–8 However, most trials provided supplements for a few years or less and were conducted in patients with preexisting CHD or at high risk for CHD and taking multiple cardiovascular drugs.

To address each of these important questions, we developed a global consortium of available studies with circulating or tissue ω-3 biomarkers and ascertained incident CHD. Our aims were to evaluate the associations of individual seafood- and plant-derived ω-3 PUFAs with incident total CHD, fatal CHD, and nonfatal MI. We also explored dose response and potential heterogeneity in effects according to key underlying participant characteristics, including medication use. Our primary hypothesis was that biomarkers of long-chain ω-3 PUFAs would be associated with a lower risk of incident fatal CHD but not nonfatal MI. In this consortium which pooled individual-level harmonized analyses from 19 studies, including 45 637 unique participants and nearly 8000 first CHD events in 16 countries, the ω-3 biomarkers ALA, DPA, and DHA were associated with a modestly lower risk of fatal CHD.

The magnitude of observed effect sizes for fatal CHD are consistent with findings for cardiac death from a meta-analysis8 of trials. In randomized clinical trials, long-chain ω-3 PUFAs benefit multiple major cardiovascular risk factors, including triglyceride levels, blood pressure, heart rate, heart rate variability, endothelial function, and myocardial oxygen demand. 1, 10 Compared with many other single nutrients, these demonstrated physiologic benefits provide strong biologic plausibility to support an effect on clinical events.

Dietary omega-3 fatty acids — seafood intake recommendations include that an AHA science advisory on seafood long-chain n-3 PUFA recommended 1 to 2 seafood meals per week to reduce risk of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and sudden cardiac death, as well as congestive heart failure. Consistent guidance advises consumption of 2 or more 3.5-ounce servings per week of fish (preferably oily fish) that would provide about 250 mg per day of EPA + DHA, and the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans advise consumption of 8 or more ounces per week (preferably oily fish) that would provide about 250 mg per day of EPA + DHA. This recommendation was based on evidence showing a significant benefit on coronary heart disease death with the consumption of 250 mg per day of EPA + DHA.

### Emerging mechanisms of cardiovascular protection for the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid [^99f48ebc]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
Potential mechanisms of cardioprotection for omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids may lessen risk of cardiovascular events through a number of mechanisms that contribute to their overall protective actions. Lowering of TGRL (triglyceride-rich lipoprotein) may account for some but certainly not all of the observed benefits (Figure 2). By boosting the production of anti-aggregatory and vasodilatory prostanoids, such as prostacyclin, omega-3 fatty acids may combat thrombosis as well as vasospasm. Omega-3 fatty acids can incorporate into plasma membranes and those of the mitochondria potentially stabilizing them to resist oxidation and confer protection against arrhythmias. Omega-3 fatty acids and certain prostanoids produced from them can exert anti-inflammatory actions. In addition, the omega-3 fatty acids can provide precursors for the synthesis of specialized proresolving mediators that can combat inflammation, perhaps causing less interference with his defenses than direct anti-inflammatory therapies. A combination of these various mechanisms may contribute to the cardiovascular protection associated with omega-3 fatty acid consumption. DHA indicates docosahexaenoic acid; and EPA, eicosapentaenoic acid.

The REDUCE-IT trial followed the JELIS trial (Japan EPA Lipid Intervention Study), which demonstrated that purified EPA (1.8 g/d) reduced the risk of major coronary events in hypercholesterolemic patients receiving statin therapy versus those subjected to statin monotherapy. JELIS did not prespecify a minimum triglyceride level for inclusion into the study. This open-label, randomized trial, showed a 19% reduction (P = 0.011) in cardiovascular events overall in the trial in the EPA group, with consistent benefits in both secondary and primary prevention. Notably, the median triglyceride level at baseline was only slightly above 150 mg/dL, meaning that approximately half of the patients had normal triglycerides. However, in post hoc analyses, among those subjects with higher triglyceride levels (> 150 mg/dL) and low HDL-C (high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol) levels (< 40 mg/dL), there was 53% reduction in events with EPA treatment.

### Cardiovascular impact of nutritional supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids: JACC focus seminar [^3748992e]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are a key component of a heart-healthy diet. For patients without clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, 2 or more servings of fatty fish per week is recommended to obtain adequate intake of omega-3 PUFAs. If this not possible, dietary supplementation with an appropriate fish oil may be reasonable. Supplementation with omega-3 PUFA capsules serves 2 distinct but overlapping roles: treatment of hypertriglyceridemia and prevention of cardiovascular events. Marine-derived omega-3 PUFAs reduce triglycerides and have pleiotropic effects including decreasing inflammation, improving plaque composition and stability, and altering cellular membranes. Clinical trial data have shown inconsistent results with omega-3 PUFAs improving cardiovascular outcomes. In this paper, the authors provide an overview of PUFAs and a summary of key clinical trial data. Recent trial data suggest the use of prescription eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease event reduction in selected populations.

### National Lipid Association scientific statement on the use of icosapent ethyl in statin-treated patients with elevated triglycerides and high or very-high ASCVD risk [^017f3bd7]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2019). High credibility.

Effects of long-chain omega-3 fatty acid supplementation — evidence synthesis and recent trials. A 2017 Science Advisory from the AHA stated that the available evidence did not support the use of low-dose omega-3 fatty acid supplementation (approximately 850–1000 mg of EPA and DHA/d) to reduce ASCVD risk for individuals in the general population, including those with prediabetes or diabetes, who are not at high risk of ASCVD; however, it stated that low-dose omega-3 fatty acid supplementation was reasonable for secondary prevention of CHD in those with a recent CHD event and for heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction, based on a meta-analysis showing modest risk reduction (RR 0.91, 95% CI: 0.85–0.98) in secondary prevention and a reduction in total mortality (RR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.83–0.99) in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. A subsequent meta-analysis of 10 trials using aggregated study-level data involving 77,917 individuals with daily dosages of EPA from 226 to 1800 mg and DHA from 0 to 1700 mg suggested no significant effects on the risks of CHD, stroke, coronary or noncoronary revascularization or overall CVD events, although results were consistent with a possible benefit for CHD death of marginal statistical significance (RR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.85–1.00, P = 0.05). With publication of three large-scale RCTs, when results from two lower-dosage primary prevention trials using 840 mg/d EPA + DHA as ethyl esters were added to the earlier meta-analysis, CHD death benefit was further supported: 1405 events in 59,684 vs 1529 in 59,560 (RR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.86–0.99, P = 0.014), and significant lower risks were also observed for myocardial infarction, total CHD, and CVD death with pooled relative risk reduction estimates ranging from 5 to 8%.

### Recent findings of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCn-3 PUFAs) on atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease (CHD) contrasting studies in Western countries to Japan [^167e81ce]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Recent long-term randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCn-3 PUFAs) on coronary heart disease (CHD) among high-risk patients conducted in Western countries all failed to show their clinical benefits. In striking contrast, an RCT of LCn-3 PUFAs on CHD conducted in Japan, which is a combination of secondary and primary prevention, showed a significant 19% reduction. Potential reasons for this discrepancy are large differences in doses of LCn-3 PUFAs administered (300–900 mg/day in Western countries vs. 1800 mg/day in Japan) and background dietary intake of LCn-3 PUFAs (< 300 mg/day in Western countries vs. > 1000 mg/day in Japan). These observations suggest that higher doses of LCn-3 PUFAs than examined in RCTs in Western countries may be cardio-protective. Atherosclerosis is the major underlying cause of CHD. Recent observational studies and an RCT of LCn-3 PUFAs on atherosclerosis in Japan show that LCn-3 PUFAs are anti-atherogenic. In this brief review, we focus on recent epidemiological and clinical findings of LCn-3 PUFAs on atherosclerosis and CHD, contrasting studies in Western countries to those in Japan. We also discuss mechanisms of high-dose LCn-3 PUFAs on atherosclerosis.

### Effect of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids added to statin therapy on coronary artery plaque in patients with coronary artery disease: a randomized clinical trial [^8077230d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Although statins reduce cardiovascular events, residual risk remains. Therefore, additional modalities are needed to reduce risk. We evaluated the effect of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid in pharmacologic doses added to statin treatment on coronary artery plaque volume.

Methods and Results

A total of 285 subjects with stable coronary artery disease on statins were randomized to omega-3 ethyl-ester (1.86 g of eicosapentaenoic acid and 1.5 g of docosahexaenoic acid daily) or no omega-3 (control) for 30 months. Coronary plaque volume was assessed by coronary computed tomographic angiography. Mean (SD) age was 63.0 (7.7) years; mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≤ 80 mg/dL. In the intention-to-treat analysis, our primary endpoint, noncalcified plaque volume, was not different between groups (P = 0.14) but approached significance in the per protocol analysis (P = 0.07). When stratified by age in the intention-to-treat analysis, younger omega-3 subjects had significantly less progression of the primary endpoint, noncalcified plaque (P = 0.013), and fibrous, calcified and total plaque. In plaque subtype analysis, controls had significant progression of fibrous plaque compared to no change in the omega-3 ethyl-ester group (median % change [interquartile range], 5.0% [-5.7, 20.0] versus -0.1% [-12.3, 14.5], respectively; P = 0.018). Among those on low-intensity statins, omega-3 ethyl-ester subjects had attenuation of fibrous plaque progression compared to controls (median % change [interquartile range], 0.3% [-12.8, 9.0] versus 4.8% [-5.1, 19.0], respectively; P = 0.032). In contrast, those on high-intensity statins had no difference in plaque change in either treatment arm.

Conclusions

High-dose eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid provided additional benefit to statins in preventing progression of fibrous coronary plaque in subjects adherent to therapy with well-controlled low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The benefit on low-intensity statin, but not high-intensity statin, suggests that statin intensity affects plaque volume.

### Fish oil and cardiometabolic diseases: recent updates and controversies [^9230ec5d]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Fatty acids derived from fish oil are long-chain omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids. The important polyunsaturated fatty acids of fish oil are eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid. For decades, there has been a debate about the use of omega-3 fatty acids and their benefits on cardiovascular health. The more recent trials including the JELIS, VITAL, STRENGTH, and ASCEND trials, addressed the paucity of data of omega-3 fatty acids on primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events and the risk-benefit balance of these supplements. Prior to these studies, many large randomized controlled trials have shown conflicting results on the effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids in patients with prior coronary artery disease, stroke, or major vascular events. These inconsistent results warrant a better understanding of the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on the subtypes of cardiovascular diseases, and their use in primary and secondary prevention. More recently, icosapent ethyl showed a significant reduction in cardiovascular mortality and ischemic events in patients with elevated triglyceride (TG) and established cardiovascular disease or diabetes. The REDUCE-IT trial paved the way to further reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with high TG despite being on a maximally tolerated statin. The aim of this review is to discuss these recent updates on the use of various forms of fish oil, including prescription form and supplement in cardiometabolic diseases, and their surrounding controversies.

### Rounding the corner on residual risk: implications of REDUCE-IT for omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids treatment in secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^bea839b3]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

In November 2018, results of the REDUCE‐IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with EPA‐Intervention Trial) trial were published. 1 The trial demonstrated that treatment with a high dose (4 g per day) of the omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) icosapent ethyl significantly reduced the risk of ischemic cardiovascular (CV) events and CV death in patients who (a) were on a stable dose of statin, (b) had established CV disease or type 2 diabetes mellitus and at least one additional CV risk factor, and (c) had elevated triglyceride (TG) levels at baseline (> 135 or 150 mg/dL). These results were remarkable because they followed a series of major TG‐lowering trials that had failed to achieve reductions in CV outcomes in similar groups of patients. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Why was REDUCE‐IT different? Are the results due solely to lowering of TG levels? What do the results mean for prevention of CV events in patients with established CV disease and elevated TG levels?

2.2 Data extraction

Two authors (S.U.K. and A.N.L) independently abstracted and adjudicated data on pre-specified data collection forms and resolved any discrepancies by consensus. We outlined data on characteristics of the trials and participants (age, sex, comorbidities, treatment arms and their composition [EPA vs. EPA+DHA with dosages]), control arms (active vs. placebo), follow-up duration, crude point estimates, events, and sample sizes for desired endpoints. Our efficacy outcomes of interest were cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, non-fatal MI, coronary heart disease (CHD) events, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), revascularization, non-fatal stroke, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke. The safety endpoints included atrial fibrillation (AF), total bleeding, major and minor bleeding, and gastrointestinal adverse events. We defined CHD events as the number of participants experiencing the first occurrence of CHD or coronary events, total MI, acute coronary syndrome, or stable or unstable angina. We abstracted data on the intention-to-treat principle.

2.3 Risk of bias within individual studies

We used Cochrane criteria for assessing the risk of bias for each trial across the following domains: randomization, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessors, selective outcome reporting, incomplete outcome data, and others. We rated trials as (i) low risk of bias, (ii) some concerns — probably low risk of bias, (iii) some concerns — probably high risk of bias, or (iv) high risk of bias. Trials were rated as high risk of bias overall if one or more domains were rated probably high risk of bias or high risk of bias, and as low risk of bias if all domains were rated probably low risk of bias or low risk of bias. Two investigators (S.U.K and A.N.L) independently appraised the potential risks of bias and resolved the discrepancies by discussion (Appendix p 3 and 4).

Supplements and nutraceuticals in CCD risk reduction: Nonprescription dietary omega-3 fatty acid supplements do not reduce CVD events or all-cause death; a Cochrane meta-analysis including 86 RCTs showed "little or no effect". Evidence for vitamin D is insufficient and in a meta-analysis of 21 RCTs (vitamin D [n = 41 669] versus placebo [n = 41 662]) supplementation did not lower the risk of MACE. Antioxidant therapy is not associated with decreased CVD events. Insufficient data support calcium supplementation (elemental calcium supplement ≥ 500 mg/d) for CVD event reduction in CCD, and a meta-analysis of double-blind RCTs ([n = 14 692] versus n = 14 243) showed an increased risk of CVD and CHD events; mixed results suggest a U-shaped dose-response pattern.

Search Strategy

We performed an updated meta‐analysis of RCTs based on the published data of a previous study‐level meta‐analysis 6 by incorporating data from the ASCEND, VITAL, and REDUCE‐IT. All 3 additional studies met inclusion criteria of RCTs using marine omega‐3 fatty acids supplementation versus placebo or open label control, with a sample size of at least 500 participants and a follow‐up duration ≥ 1 year. Study‐level data from these 3 studies were extracted from published results.

The end points of interest included MI (fatal and/or nonfatal MI), death from CHD, total CHD (MI, death from CHD, or coronary revascularization), total stroke (fatal and/or nonfatal stroke), death from CVD, total CVD (nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, death from CVD, or hospitalization because of a cardiovascular cause), and major vascular events (nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, any revascularization, or death from CVD). All the participants included in the current analysis provided written informed consent.

### Use of supplemental long-chain omega-3 fatty acids and risk for cardiac death: an updated meta-analysis and review of research gaps [^fd6a3ff3]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing use of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-OM3), primarily eicosapentaenoic acid, and/or docosahexaenoic acid have shown mixed results.

Objective

The objectives of the study were to update and further explore the available RCT data regarding LC-OM3 supplementation and risk for cardiac death and to propose testable hypotheses for the mixed results obtained in RCTs regarding supplemental LC-OM3 use and cardiac risk.

Methods

A literature search was conducted using PubMed and Ovid/MEDLINE for RCTs assessing LC-OM3 supplements or pharmaceuticals with intervention periods of at least 6 months and reporting on the outcome of cardiac death. Meta-analysis was used to compare cumulative frequencies of cardiac death events between the LC-OM3 and control groups, including sensitivity and subset analyses.

Results

Fourteen RCTs were identified for the primary analysis (71,899 subjects). In the LC-OM3 arms, 1613 cardiac deaths were recorded (4.48% of subjects), compared with 1746 cardiac deaths in the control groups (4.87% of subjects). The pooled relative risk estimate showed an 8.0% (95% confidence interval 1.6%, 13.9%, P = 0.015) lower risk in the LC-OM3 arms vs controls. Subset analyses showed numerically larger effects (12.9%-29.1% lower risks, all P < .05) in subsets of RCTs with eicosapentaenoic acid + docosahexaenoic acid dosages > 1 g/d and higher risk samples (secondary prevention, baseline mean or median triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥ 130 mg/dL, statin use < 40% of subjects). Heterogeneity was low (I 2 ≤ 15.5%, P > .05) for the primary and subset analyses.

Conclusion

LC-OM3 supplementation is associated with a modest reduction in cardiac death.

### Effects of B vitamins and omega 3 fatty acids on cardiovascular diseases: a randomised placebo controlled trial [^e054aa29]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Observational studies have reported inverse associations of cardiovascular disease with dietary intake or plasma concentrations of B vitamins (folate and vitamin B-6) and omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Moderately elevated concentrations of plasma total homocysteine have been associated with higher risks of coronary heart disease and stroke, and dietary supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B-12 typically lowers plasma total homocysteine concentration by about 25–30%, raising the prospect that dietary supplementation with these B vitamins might reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke.

Several large scale trials have examined the effects of supplementation with B vitamins on cardiovascular disease, but none has reported any significant effects on risk of cardiovascular disease. Possible reasons for the failure of these trials to show any significant effects on vascular disease include lack of statistical power to detect treatment effects (owing to an insufficient number of participants or duration of treatment), attenuation of the effects of B vitamins by mandatory folic acid fortification or by widespread use of supplements containing folic acid among trial participants, or that homocysteine is not causally related to vascular disease.

Observational studies have also reported inverse associations of cardiovascular disease with dietary intake or plasma concentrations of omega 3 fatty acids (mainly eicosapentanoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid), suggesting that supplementation with omega 3 fatty acids might exert protective effects on cardiovascular disease. These fatty acids have been shown to have beneficial effects on several cardiovascular risk factors — including blood pressure, plasma triglyceride concentration, and markers of thrombosis and inflammation — and may also have antiarrhythmic effects. Although some trials involving patients with a history of cardiovascular diseases or with high levels of cardiovascular risk factors have reported positive effects of omega 3 fatty acids on cardiovascular events, other trials have reported no effects on arrhythmia or mortality.

The aims of the Supplémentation en Folates et Omega-3 (SU.FOL.OM3) trial were to investigate whether dietary supplementation with homocysteine lowering B vitamins or omega 3 fatty acids, or both, could prevent major cardiovascular events in patients with a history of ischaemic heart disease or stroke.

### Omega-6 fats for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^009c8ba5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Omega-6 fats are polyunsaturated fats vital for many physiological functions, but their effect on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is debated.

Objectives

To assess effects of increasing omega-6 fats (linoleic acid (LA), gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) and arachidonic acid (AA)) on CVD and all-cause mortality.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase to May 2017 and clinicaltrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to September 2016, without language restrictions. We checked trials included in relevant systematic reviews.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing higher versus lower omega-6 fat intake in adults with or without CVD, assessing effects over at least 12 months. We included full texts, abstracts, trials registry entries and unpublished studies. Outcomes were all-cause mortality, CVD mortality, CVD events, risk factors (blood lipids, adiposity, blood pressure), and potential adverse events. We excluded trials where we could not separate omega-6 fat effects from those of other dietary, lifestyle or medication interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened titles/abstracts, assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias of included trials. We wrote to authors of included studies. Meta-analyses used random-effects analysis, while sensitivity analyses used fixed-effects and limited analyses to trials at low summary risk of bias. We assessed GRADE quality of evidence for 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included 19 RCTs in 6461 participants who were followed for one to eight years. Seven trials assessed the effects of supplemental GLA and 12 of LA, none DGLA or AA; the omega-6 fats usually displaced dietary saturated or monounsaturated fats. We assessed three RCTs as being at low summary risk of bias. Primary outcomes: we found low-quality evidence that increased intake of omega-6 fats may make little or no difference to all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.12, 740 deaths, 4506 randomised, 10 trials) or CVD events (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.15, 1404 people experienced events of 4962 randomised, 7 trials). We are uncertain whether increasing omega-6 fats affects CVD mortality (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.55, 472 deaths, 4019 randomised, 7 trials), coronary heart disease events (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.17, 1059 people with events of 3997 randomised, 7 trials), major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.20, 817 events, 2879 participants, 2 trials) or stroke (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.45 to 4.11, 54 events, 3730 participants, 4 trials), as we assessed the evidence as being of very low quality. We found no evidence of dose-response or duration effects for any primary outcome, but there was a suggestion of greater protection in participants with lower baseline omega-6 intake across outcomes. Additional key outcomes: we found increased intake of omega-6 fats may reduce myocardial infarction (MI) risk (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.02, 609 events, 4606 participants, 7 trials, low-quality evidence). High-quality evidence suggests increasing omega-6 fats reduces total serum cholesterol a little in the long term (mean difference (MD) -0.33 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.50 to -0.16, I² = 81%; heterogeneity partially explained by dose, 4280 participants, 10 trials). Increasing omega-6 fats probably has little or no effect on adiposity (body mass index (BMI) MD -0.20 kg/m 2, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.16, 371 participants, 1 trial, moderate-quality evidence). It may make little or no difference to serum triglycerides (MD -0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.21, 834 participants, 5 trials), HDL (MD -0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.02, 1995 participants, 4 trials) or low-density lipoprotein (MD -0.04 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.14, 244 participants, 2 trials, low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

This is the most extensive systematic assessment of effects of omega-6 fats on cardiovascular health, mortality, lipids and adiposity to date, using previously unpublished data. We found no evidence that increasing omega-6 fats reduces cardiovascular outcomes other than MI, where 53 people may need to increase omega-6 fat intake to prevent 1 person from experiencing MI. Although benefits of omega-6 fats remain to be proven, increasing omega-6 fats may be of benefit in people at high risk of MI. Increased omega-6 fats reduce serum total cholesterol but not other blood fat fractions or adiposity.

### Meta-analysis of contemporary trials of omega-3 fatty acids containing both eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids [^6c1e14bb]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Drs. Mason and Eckel raise the concern that older trials of combined eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) with suboptimal statin therapy can bias results in favor of EPA+DHA. The authors correctly pointed out that GISSI-Pand GISSI-HFwere notably different from contemporary trials in the use of background statin therapy even at the end of the trials. Our meta-analysis followed a pre-specified study selection criteria and included all the eligible studies to avoid selection and reporting biases. However, we agree with the authors that both the GISSI-Pand GISSI-HFtrials (42% relative weight in the EPA+DHA meta-analysis) carry considerable potential to influence results in favor of EPA+DHA therapy. Therefore, we repeated the meta-analysis of EPA+DHA trials excluding these older trials and found that EPA+DHA therapy was associated with neither lower cardiovascular mortality (RR: 0.96 [0.90–1.03]; P = 0.30) nor reduced non-fatal cardiovascular outcomes (Figure).

Our meta-analysisconcluded that cardiovascular risk reduction was present with EPA monotherapy more so than with combined EPA+DHA. We thank Drs. Mason and Eckel for their insightful observation that allowed us to clarify further that the cardiovascular benefits of omega-3 FAs in the contemporary era are limited to EPA monotherapy. These findings align with recent trials showing remarkable cardiovascular risk reduction with EPA monotherapy and underscore that the beneficial effects of prescription EPA should not be generalized to mixed prescription formulations of omega-3 FAs or poorly regulated dietary supplements.

### Erythrocyte long-chain omega-3 fatty acid levels are inversely associated with mortality and with incident cardiovascular disease: the framingham heart study [^f9855e98]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2018). Low credibility.

A variety of exploratory analyses were conducted here. Given the controversies regarding the CVD effects of the n-6 PUFAs and the frequent use of the n-6:n-3 ratio, in one analysis we controlled for RBC n-6 PUFA levels and in another we directly compared the ratio with the Omega-3 Index. In neither case did the n-6 PUFAs add or detract from the omega-3 effect. Hence, this study found no support for using a combined metric with n-6 and n-3 PUFAs. Finally, we compared associations with disease outcomes for the Omega-3 Index with that of total cholesterol, one of the most well-known CVD risk factors. This analysis was undertaken to give some perspective of the relative sensitivity of these 2 biomarkers. In head-to-head comparisons with the same multivariable models, a higher Omega-3 Index was significantly associated with reduced risk for 4 of the 5 outcomes studies, but cholesterol was unrelated to risk for any outcome. This may be because about 38% of participants were on a cholesterol-lowering medication, and so cholesterol levels at baseline were therapeutically reduced; because 399 subjects with a diagnosis of CVD at baseline were excluded; or because those who were particularly susceptible to cholesterol-induced CHD may have already died. There is indeed some controversy regarding the predictive power of serum cholesterol in older individuals. Nevertheless, in the unique context of this study in which we controlled for 17 other variables, cholesterol levels were unassociated with these outcomes. Whatever the reasons, this observation supports the need for further research to more clearly define the relative roles of traditional and emerging biomarkers in risk stratification.

The originally proposed (in 2004) clinical cut-points for the Omega-3 Index were < 4% (high risk) and > 8% (low risk). Although these have recently been confirmed in a meta-analysis including 10 cohorts and over 27,000 subjects, it was of interest to explore their utility in the present study as well. We found a significant trend across risk categories for total mortality and significant reductions in risk for the intermediate group compared with the high group, but not for the > 8% category. This may reflect a nonlinear relationship between the Omega-3 Index and risk as has been suggested by others, or the fact that only 10% of the sample was in the > 08% category. Nevertheless, the hazard ratio of 0.69 for any death in the > 8% category is at least suggestive of lower risk.

Chronic coronary disease lipid management — icosapent ethyl and omega-3 fatty acids trial evidence: In REDUCE-IT, patients with triglyceride levels between 150 mg/dL and 499 mg/dL and an LDL-C level of < 100 mg/dL on background statin therapy were randomized to 4 g/day of icosapent ethyl or mineral oil placebo, and icosapent ethyl reduced the relative risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) by 25% and cardiovascular death by 20%, with benefit not explained by the modest 17% triglyceride reduction. In RESPECT-EPA, icosapent ethyl 1800 mg/day showed a borderline significant reduction in MACE (10.90% versus 14.90%; P = 0.055) in 2506 participants on background statins, whereas the STRENGTH trial found no benefit with a 4 g/day carboxylic acid omega-3 formulation versus corn oil placebo. Incident atrial fibrillation was more common with both formulations, and use of mineral oil placebo in REDUCE-IT is noted as a concern for biomarker effects.

### Omega 6 fatty acids for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^1f74cce3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Omega 6 plays a vital role in many physiological functions but there is controversy concerning its effect on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. There is conflicting evidence whether increasing or decreasing omega 6 intake results in beneficial effects.

Objectives

The two primary objectives of this Cochrane review were to determine the effectiveness of:1. Increasing omega 6 (Linoleic acid (LA), Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), Dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA), Arachidonic acid (AA), or any combination) intake in place of saturated or monounsaturated fats or carbohydrates for the primary prevention of CVD.2. Decreasing omega 6 (LA, GLA, DGLA, AA, or any combination) intake in place of carbohydrates or protein (or both) for the primary prevention of CVD.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases up to 23 September 2014: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on the Cochrane Library (Issue 8 of 12, 2014); MEDLINE (Ovid) (1946 to September week 2, 2014); EMBASE Classic and EMBASE (Ovid) (1947 to September 2014); Web of Science Core Collection (Thomson Reuters) (1990 to September 2014); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and Health Technology Assessment Database, and Health Economics Evaluations Database on the Cochrane Library (Issue 3 of 4, 2014). We searched trial registers and reference lists of reviews for further studies. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions stating an intention to increase or decrease omega 6 fatty acids, lasting at least six months, and including healthy adults or adults at high risk of CVD. The comparison group was given no advice, no supplementation, a placebo, a control diet, or continued with their usual diet. The outcomes of interest were CVD clinical events (all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal end points) and CVD risk factors (changes in blood pressure, changes in blood lipids, occurrence of type 2 diabetes). We excluded trials involving exercise or multifactorial interventions to avoid confounding.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias in the included trials.

Main Results

We included four RCTs (five papers) that randomised 660 participants. No ongoing trials were identified. All included trials had at least one domain with an unclear risk of bias. There were no RCTs of omega 6 intake reporting CVD clinical events. Three trials investigated the effect of increased omega 6 intake on lipid levels (total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL-cholesterol), and high density lipoprotein (HDL-cholesterol)), two trials reported triglycerides, and two trials reported blood pressure (diastolic and systolic blood pressure). Two trials, one with two relevant intervention arms, investigated the effect of decreased omega 6 intake on blood pressure parameters and lipid levels (total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and HDL-cholesterol) and one trial reported triglycerides. Our analyses found no statistically significant effects of either increased or decreased omega 6 intake on CVD risk factors. Two studies were supported by funding from the UK Food Standards Agency and Medical Research Council. One study was supported by Lipid Nutrition, a commercial company in the Netherlands and the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs. The final study was supported by grants from the Finnish Food Research Foundation, Finnish Heart Research Foundation, Aarne and Aili Turnen Foundation, and the Research Council for Health, Academy of Finland.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no studies examining the effects of either increased or decreased omega 6 on our primary outcome CVD clinical endpoints and insufficient evidence to show an effect of increased or decreased omega 6 intake on CVD risk factors such as blood lipids and blood pressure. Very few trials were identified with a relatively small number of participants randomised. There is a need for larger well conducted RCTs assessing cardiovascular events as well as cardiovascular risk factors.

### Marine omega-3 supplementation and cardiovascular disease: an updated meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials involving 127 477 participants [^43ff0633]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Whether marine omega‐3 supplementation is associated with reduction in risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains controversial.

Methods and Results

This meta‐analysis included study‐level data from 13 trials. The outcomes of interest included myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease (CHD) death, total CHD, total stroke, CVD death, total CVD, and major vascular events. The unadjusted rate ratios were calculated using a fixed‐effect meta‐analysis. A meta‐regression was conducted to estimate the dose–response relationship between marine omega‐3 dosage and risk of each prespecified outcome. During a mean treatment duration of 5.0 years, 3838 myocardial infarctions, 3008 CHD deaths, 8435 total CHD events, 2683 strokes, 5017 CVD deaths, 15 759 total CVD events, and 16 478 major vascular events were documented. In the analysis excluding REDUCE‐IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl‐Intervention Trial), marine omega‐3 supplementation was associated with significantly lower risk of myocardial infarction (rate ratio [RR] [95% CI]: 0.92 [0.86, 0.99]; P = 0.020), CHD death (RR [95% CI]: 0.92 [0.86, 0.98]; P = 0.014), total CHD (RR [95% CI]: 0.95 [0.91, 0.99]; P = 0.008), CVD death (RR [95% CI]: 0.93 [0.88, 0.99]; P = 0.013), and total CVD (RR [95% CI]: 0.97 [0.94, 0.99]; P = 0.015). Inverse associations for all outcomes were strengthened after including REDUCE‐IT while introducing statistically significant heterogeneity. Statistically significant linear dose–response relationships were found for total CVD and major vascular events in the analyses with and without including REDUCE‐IT.

Conclusions

Marine omega‐3 supplementation lowers risk for myocardial infarction, CHD death, total CHD, CVD death, and total CVD, even after exclusion of REDUCE‐IT. Risk reductions appeared to be linearly related to marine omega‐3 dose.

Fig. 1
Flow chart showing study selection process.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics of trials and participants.

Nineteen studies were judged at low risk of bias in all domains. All other studies had probably a high or high risk of bias in the domains of selective outcome reporting, incomplete outcome data, or blinding of participants and personnel or outcome assessment.

A total of 25 trials (n = 143,514) reported 5550 events of cardiovascular mortality, and 24 trials (n = 140,983) reported 10,795 events of all-cause mortality. Omega-3 FA was associated with reducing cardiovascular mortality (-1.4 incident cases per 1000 person-years [-2.5, -0.4]; RR, 0.93 [0.88–0.98]; p = 0.01; moderate certainty; Fig. 2) but not all-cause mortality (-0.6 incident cases per 1000-person years [-1.4, 0.4]; RR, 0.97 [0.93–1.02]; p = 0.27; low certainty; Appendix p 15). Meta-analysis showed reduction in cardiovascular mortality with EPA monotherapy (RR: 0.82 [0.68–0.99]; p = 0.04) and EPA+DHA combination (RR: 0.94 [0.89–0.99]; p = 0.02) (p for interaction = 0.19).

### Fish and long-chain omega-3 fatty acid intake and risk of coronary heart disease and total mortality in diabetic women [^eadf8a84]. Circulation (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Although several prospective cohort studies have found an inverse association between fish consumption and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) or sudden cardiac death in the general population, limited data are available among diabetic patients.

Methods and Results

We examined prospectively the association between intake of fish and omega-3 fatty acids and risk of CHD and total mortality among 5103 female nurses with diagnosed type 2 diabetes but free of cardiovascular disease or cancer at baseline. Between 1980 and 1996 (45 845 person-years of follow-up), we documented 362 incident cases of CHD (141 CHD deaths and 221 nonfatal myocardial infarctions) and 468 deaths from all causes. Compared with women who seldom consumed fish (< 1 serving/mo), the relative risks (RRs) (95% CI) of CHD adjusted for age, smoking, and other established coronary risk factors were 0.70 (0.48 to 1.03) for fish consumption 1 to 3 times per month, 0.60 (0.42 to 0.85) for once per week, 0.64 (0.42 to 0.99) for 2 to 4 times per week, and 0.36 (0.20 to 0.66) for 5 or more times per week (P for trend = 0.002). Higher consumption of fish was also associated with a significantly lower total mortality (multivariate RR = 0.48 [0.29 to 0.80] for ≥ 5 times per week [P for trend = 0.005]). Higher consumption of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids was associated with a trend toward lower incidence of CHD (RR = 0.69 [95% CI 0.47 to 1.03], P for trend = 0.10) and total mortality (RR = 0.63 [95% CI, 0.45 to 0.88], P for trend = 0.02).

Conclusions

A higher consumption of fish and long-chain omega-3 fatty acids was associated with a lower CHD incidence and total mortality among diabetic women.

### Effect of omega-3 fatty acids on cardiovascular outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^7bc91176]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

3 Results

We reviewed a total of 798 articles for eligibility after removing duplicates and screening at the title and abstract level. Further, 760 articles were removed based on a priori study selection criteria. Ultimately, 38 trials encompassing 149,051 patients were included (Fig. 1). The characteristics of the participants and trials are reported in Table 1. Of 38 trials, 4 trials compared EPA vs. control and 34 trials compared EPA+DHA vs. control. Twenty-two trials studied primary prevention. The dose of omega-3 FAs ranged from 0.4 g/day to 5.5 g/day. The EPA trials had dose ranges from 1.8 to 4.0 g/day and EPA+DHA from 0.4 to 5.5 g/day. The patients' mean age ranged from 39 to 78 years, and the proportion of enrolled women varied from 0% to 77.5%. The median follow-up duration across the trials was 2.0 years (IQR, 1–4.2).

### Dietary and circulating long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and mortality risk after myocardial infarction: a long-term follow-up of the alpha omega cohort [^7f1dad27]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Increasing the intake of long‐chain omega‐3 fatty acids (n‐3 FAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is often recommended for the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD).EPA and DHA can be obtained by consuming oily fish and other seafood. Alpha‐linolenic acid (ALA) is the parent n‐3 FA derived from plant foods, such as flaxseed, nuts, and vegetable oils. EPA (and DHA) may be formed from ALA, but conversion in the human body is probably < 10%, as indicated by stable‐isotope studies. Dietary intake of EPA+DHA in Western populations is generally < 500 mg/d, and ALA intake ≈1.5 g/d (< 1 energy percent). Concentrations of n‐3 FAs in blood are biomarkers of essential FA intake, especially for EPA+DHA.

Most observational studies on n‐3 FAs and mortality have focused on healthy populations. A recent pooled analysis including 42 466 individuals from 17 prospective cohorts has shown that higher levels of circulating EPA+DHA but not ALA were associated with an ≈20% lower risk for CVD mortality. However, the relationship between n‐3 FAs and mortality is not yet clear in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). In the Alpha Omega Cohort of Dutch patients who suffered a myocardial infarction (MI), we examined associations of dietary intake of EPA+DHA, fish, and ALA as well as circulating levels of n‐3 FAs, with fatal CHD (primary outcome), CVD and all‐cause mortality during > 12 years follow‐up.

### Emerging mechanisms of cardiovascular protection for the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid [^7d015dc1]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

Highlights

Omega-3 fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have multiple biological effects.
In the REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events With Icosapent Ethyl–Intervention Trial), a prescription EPA-only formulation called icosapent ethyl reduced cardiovascular events by 25% in high-risk patients with either established cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus plus other risk factors.
Cardiovascular outcomes trials that have evaluated mixed (DHA-containing) omega-3 fatty acids on top of contemporary medical therapy have thus far not shown the benefits of icosapent ethyl as seen in REDUCE-IT and the JELIS (Japan EPA Lipid Intervention Study), highlighting the importance of understanding molecular mechanisms of action of specific omega-3 fatty acids.
EPA and DHA differ markedly, with distinct effects on membrane structure, rates of lipid oxidation, inflammatory biomarkers, and endothelial function, as well as tissue distributions.
Ongoing scientific efforts to understand the mechanism of action for EPA will help usher in a new era of cardiovascular therapeutics.

### Emerging mechanisms of cardiovascular protection for the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid [^4ba46860]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with well-controlled LDL (low-density lipoprotein) levels still have residual cardiovascular risk associated with elevated triglycerides. Epidemiological studies have shown that elevated fasting triglyceride levels associate independently with incident cardiovascular events, and abundant recent human genetic data support the causality of TGRLs (triglyceride-rich lipoproteins) in atherothrombosis. Omega-3 fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), lower blood triglyceride concentrations but likely exert additional atheroprotective properties at higher doses. Omega-3 fatty acids modulate T-cell differentiation and give rise to various prostaglandins and specialized proresolving lipid mediators that promote resolution of tissue injury and inflammation. The REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl–Intervention Trial) with an EPA-only formulation lowered a composite of cardiovascular events by 25% in patients with established cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus and other cardiovascular risk factors. This clinical benefit likely arises from multiple molecular mechanisms discussed in this review. Indeed, human plaques readily incorporate EPA, which may render them less likely to trigger clinical events. EPA and DHA differ in their effects on membrane structure, rates of lipid oxidation, inflammatory biomarkers, and endothelial function as well as tissue distributions. Trials that have evaluated DHA-containing high-dose omega-3 fatty acids have thus far not shown the benefits of EPA alone demonstrated in REDUCE-IT. This review will consider the mechanistic evidence that helps to understand the potential mechanisms of benefit of EPA.

### Plasma omega-3 fatty acids and the risk of cardiovascular events in patients after an acute coronary syndrome in MERLIN-TIMI 36 [^004ff1d2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In a large clinical trial population of patients after a non–ST‐segment–elevation ACS, we observed an inverse relationship between plasma long‐chain ω3 fatty acid content and the odds of cardiovascular and sudden cardiac death independent of traditional risk factors. Although directional consistency was seen across the ω3 subtypes, the magnitude of the effect appeared to be greatest for the long‐chain marine‐based ω3‐PUFAs including DHA, DPA, and EPA. Together, these findings lend support to the emerging evidence that suggests that certain types of ω3 supplementation may reduce the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in higher‐risk populations.

Current guidelines of the American Heart Association suggest ω3‐PUFA supplementation or consumption from seafood may be reasonable to help prevent sudden cardiac death in patients with coronary heart disease. 19, 20 However, despite supportive evidence from observational studies, data from clinical trials remain inconsistent. 5, 6, 7, 21, 22, 23 Some of the inconsistency between findings may be explained partly by the patient population studied and differences in the dosing, type, and quality of the ω3‐PUFAs. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

To date, the relationship between circulating ω3‐PUFA content and cardiovascular events in patients after ACS is not well established. Prior observational studies have suggested an association between plasma ω3‐PUFA and lower risk of sudden cardiac death in patients without a history of cardiovascular disease or those with stable atherosclerotic disease. 24, 25 In contrast, in a relatively small investigation among 460 patients after recent ACS, red blood cell ω3‐PUFA content was not significantly associated with cardiac or all‐cause death. 26

Building on this evidence, earlier trials demonstrated that low‐dose (up to 1 g/d) ω3‐PUFA supplementation may offer protective effects among patients with recent acute myocardial infarction with reduced risk of cardiovascular death and in particular sudden cardiac death. 8 In contrast, 2 large and well‐conducted randomized controlled trials in primary prevention were unable to demonstrate a significant benefit for low‐dose ω3 supplementation for reducing major adverse cardiovascular events, 6, 7 although a significant reduction in the secondary outcome of coronary heart disease was seen in one of the studies. 7
