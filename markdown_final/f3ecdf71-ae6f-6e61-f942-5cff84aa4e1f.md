## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diagnosing a 23-year-old man with persistent tachycardia and hypertension, a family history of mitral valve prolapse, and ongoing symptoms despite stopping stimulant medication. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the differential diagnosis for tachycardia and hypertension in a young adult. Then, I should verify how stimulant exposure and withdrawal influence heart rate and blood pressure. Next, I will examine the implications of a strong family history of mitral valve prolapse and the arrhythmogenic MVP syndrome. After that, I need to outline the diagnostic workup, including ECG, echocardiography, ambulatory rhythm monitoring, and when to add cardiac MRI. Finally, I will synthesize a prioritized diagnosis and immediate management plan, making sure I double-check guideline-backed thresholds and risk stratification features.

> Let me first confirm the key clinical problem: persistent sinus tachycardia around 120 bpm with hypertension in a 23-year-old male, with a first-degree family history of mitral valve prolapse and symptoms that did not resolve after stopping stimulants. This pattern pushes me to consider structural or electrical heart disease rather than purely medication effects, so I should not jump to conclusions about stimulant causality just because of exposure history [^113sN9tw] [^113W74kC].

> I will now examine the differential for tachycardia and hypertension in this age group, and I need to ensure I keep life-threatening entities in view. Primary considerations include arrhythmogenic mitral valve prolapse with ventricular ectopy or autonomic dysfunction, stimulant-related persistent autonomic effects or withdrawal rebound, primary autonomic disorders such as inappropriate sinus tachycardia or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, secondary causes like hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma, or anemia, and other structural heart disease including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or congenital anomalies. Given the family history and persistent symptoms off stimulants, MVP-related arrhythmogenic risk rises on the list, but I should verify with objective testing before concluding [^1137JmgD] [^115VqYfZ] [^112Xc1vW] [^1147Ewyb].

> Wait, let me verify the stimulant angle carefully. Stimulants can raise heart rate and blood pressure by about 3–6 bpm and 2–4 mmHg on average, but larger increases occur in a subset, and abrupt discontinuation can produce withdrawal physiology with rebound hyperadrenergic symptoms. However, the persistence of tachycardia and hypertension weeks after cessation makes a pure stimulant effect less likely to be the sole explanation, so I should pivot toward evaluating intrinsic cardiac substrates while still acknowledging that chronic stimulant exposure may have unmasked or aggravated an underlying vulnerability [^113sN9tw] [^113n9Qdp] [^113W74kC].

> Next, I should review the significance of the family history of mitral valve prolapse. MVP is common, around 2–3% in the general population, and has a heritable component with familial clustering. Importantly, a subset of patients, including some with bileaflet prolapse, mitral annulus disjunction, and myocardial fibrosis, are at increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death even without significant regurgitation, particularly in younger individuals. This risk signal strengthens the case for targeted imaging and rhythm surveillance in this patient [^115XfVuA] [^1137JmgD] [^115VqYfZ].

> Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic workup sequence to avoid missing time-sensitive risks. First-line tests should include a 12-lead ECG to assess for repolarization abnormalities, conduction disease, or ventricular ectopy, and transthoracic echocardiography to define valve morphology, prolapse severity, regurgitation, annulus size, and ventricular size and function. Given the arrhythmogenic MVP concern, I should add 24–48 hour Holter monitoring to quantify PVC burden and look for non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, because a high PVC burden is a recognized risk marker in MVP. If echocardiography is non-diagnostic but suspicion remains high, cardiac MRI can detect papillary muscle or inferobasal fibrosis, which is a strong predictor of ventricular arrhythmias in MVP [^112nPhJA] [^115VqYfZ] [^1137JmgD].

> I need to check guideline-directed thresholds for when to escalate evaluation. The AHA/ACC/HRS ventricular arrhythmia guidance emphasizes structured evaluation in patients with symptoms and family history of structural heart disease, including MVP, and supports ECG, echocardiography, and ambulatory monitoring to uncover precipitating factors and arrhythmia burden. This aligns with using Holter and considering CMR when initial testing is equivocal but clinical suspicion persists [^116EQeVd] [^112Xc1vW].

> Let me consider immediate management while diagnostics are pending. I should confirm that stimulants remain off, initiate strict blood pressure monitoring, and consider a beta-blocker such as metoprolol or carvedilol to blunt sympathetic tone, reduce heart rate, and lower blood pressure, especially if there is ventricular ectopy or autonomic dysregulation. I should double-check that beta-blockade is appropriate here and not contraindicated by any occult structural disease, and I will titrate to effect with close follow-up.

> But wait, what if the echocardiogram reveals high-risk MVP features such as bileaflet prolapse, mitral annulus disjunction, or significant regurgitation with ventricular enlargement. In that scenario, I should involve electrophysiology for risk stratification and consider implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy if there is sustained VT, high PVC burden with fibrosis, or prior aborted SCD, recognizing that contemporary series support ICD use in malignant MVP phenotypes despite the lack of randomized trials in this specific subgroup [^113sN9tw] [^114ETjZf].

> I should double-check for alternative or contributory diagnoses that could perpetuate tachycardia and hypertension. Thyroid function tests, a basic metabolic panel, and a CBC can screen for endocrine or hematologic drivers, while a careful history and exam can help distinguish inappropriate sinus tachycardia or POTS, which are more common in young women and typically present with orthostatic intolerance rather than isolated resting tachycardia. If POTS is suspected, tilt-table testing may be considered, but routine echocardiography is not recommended in POTS unless mimics are suspected [^1147Ewyb] [^111NLLhw].

> Synthesizing this, my leading diagnosis is arrhythmogenic mitral valve prolapse syndrome given the persistent tachycardia, hypertension, and strong family history, with the working hypothesis that stimulant exposure unmasked autonomic and arrhythmic vulnerability rather than causing the syndrome directly. Key differentials to exclude include primary autonomic disorders, hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma, and other structural heart diseases such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which will be clarified by ECG, echocardiography, Holter monitoring, and selective use of cardiac MRI [^1137JmgD] [^115VqYfZ] [^113sN9tw].

> Final diagnostic plan: obtain a 12-lead ECG now, schedule transthoracic echocardiography urgently, and arrange 24–48 hour Holter monitoring to quantify ventricular ectopy. If echocardiography shows bileaflet prolapse, mitral annulus disjunction, significant regurgitation, or ventricular enlargement, proceed to cardiac MRI for fibrosis assessment and refer to electrophysiology for risk stratification. Concurrently, stop stimulants, monitor vitals closely, and initiate beta-blocker therapy for rate and blood pressure control while awaiting results, escalating to ICD candidacy if high-risk features and arrhythmias are confirmed [^112nPhJA] [^115VqYfZ] [^116EQeVd].

The most likely diagnosis is **mitral valve prolapse (MVP)** with autonomic dysfunction, given the persistent tachycardia and hypertension despite stopping stimulants, and the strong family history of MVP [^115XfVuA] [^111R1p9k]. MVP can cause autonomic instability and arrhythmias, and stimulants may unmask or exacerbate these features [^1137JmgD] [^113sN9tw]. The next best step is to **obtain an echocardiogram** to confirm MVP and assess for regurgitation or structural abnormalities, and to perform ECG and ambulatory monitoring to evaluate for arrhythmias [^112nPhJA] [^115VqYfZ]. Management includes stopping stimulants, initiating beta-blocker therapy for symptom control, and referring to cardiology for risk stratification and follow-up [^115CBWRh].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for persistent tachycardia and hypertension in a young adult with a family history of MVP includes:

- **Mitral valve prolapse (MVP)**: A common heritable valvular disorder that can cause autonomic dysfunction, arrhythmias, and, in some cases, significant mitral regurgitation [^115XfVuA] [^1137JmgD].

- **Autonomic dysfunction**: MVP is associated with autonomic instability, which can present as persistent tachycardia and hypertension even after cessation of stimulant medications [^notfound].

- **Primary hypertension**: Essential hypertension can present in young adults, but the persistence of tachycardia suggests a secondary etiology.

- **Hyperthyroidism**: Thyroid dysfunction can cause tachycardia and hypertension.

- **Pheochromocytoma**: A rare catecholamine-secreting tumor causing episodic hypertension and tachycardia.

- **Anxiety disorders**: Chronic anxiety can contribute to persistent tachycardia and hypertension.

Given the patient's family history and the persistence of symptoms after stopping stimulants, **MVP with autonomic dysfunction** is the most likely diagnosis [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiology of mitral valve prolapse

MVP is characterized by **myxomatous degeneration** of the mitral valve leaflets, leading to prolapse into the left atrium during systole [^115XfVuA]. This structural abnormality can cause mitral regurgitation, arrhythmias, and autonomic dysfunction. Autonomic instability in MVP is thought to result from mechanical stretch and abnormal signaling within the mitral valve apparatus, affecting cardiac innervation and leading to sympathetic overactivity [^1137JmgD].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting MVP diagnosis

Several clinical features in this patient support a diagnosis of MVP:

- **Family history**: MVP has a strong genetic component, with familial clustering observed in approximately 2–3% of the general population [^115XfVuA] [^111R1p9k].

- **Persistent tachycardia and hypertension**: MVP is associated with autonomic dysfunction, which can manifest as persistent tachycardia and hypertension even after cessation of stimulant medications [^notfound].

- **Stimulant medication use**: Stimulants can exacerbate autonomic symptoms in patients with MVP, but the persistence of symptoms after cessation suggests an underlying autonomic dysfunction rather than a direct pharmacologic effect [^notfound].

---

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

To confirm the diagnosis of MVP and assess for complications, the following diagnostic tests are recommended:

| **Diagnostic test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|
| Echocardiography (transthoracic) | Confirm MVP diagnosis, assess severity of mitral regurgitation, and evaluate structural abnormalities [^112nPhJA] [^117MyyQL] |
| Electrocardiogram (ECG) | Identify arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities, or ischemic changes [^112nPhJA] |
| Ambulatory ECG monitoring (Holter or event monitor) | Detect intermittent arrhythmias or autonomic dysfunction [^112nPhJA] |
| Thyroid function tests | Exclude hyperthyroidism as a cause of tachycardia and hypertension |
| Urine catecholamines or metanephrines | Exclude pheochromocytoma if clinically suspected |

---

## Management strategies

Management of MVP with autonomic dysfunction focuses on symptom control, risk stratification, and regular follow-up:

- **Cessation of stimulant medications**: Stimulants can exacerbate autonomic symptoms and should be avoided in patients with MVP and autonomic dysfunction [^notfound].

- **Beta-blocker therapy**: Beta-blockers are first-line therapy for controlling tachycardia, hypertension, and autonomic symptoms in MVP patients [^notfound].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Salt restriction, weight management, and regular aerobic exercise can help control blood pressure and improve autonomic function.

- **Regular follow-up**: Periodic echocardiography and clinical evaluation are essential to monitor disease progression and detect complications such as significant mitral regurgitation or arrhythmias [^notfound].

---

## Potential complications and prognosis

MVP is generally benign, but complications can occur, including:

- **Mitral regurgitation**: Progressive regurgitation may require surgical intervention [^115U23ad].

- **Arrhythmias**: Ventricular arrhythmias, including premature ventricular contractions and ventricular tachycardia, can occur [^1137JmgD].

- **Sudden cardiac death**: Rarely, MVP has been associated with sudden cardiac death, particularly in patients with bileaflet prolapse and myocardial fibrosis [^1137JmgD] [^116AmgSR].

Overall, the prognosis for patients with MVP and autonomic dysfunction is favorable with appropriate management and regular follow-up [^117MyyQL].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is **mitral valve prolapse with autonomic dysfunction**, given the persistent tachycardia and hypertension despite cessation of stimulant medications and the strong family history of MVP. The next best step is to **obtain an echocardiogram** to confirm the diagnosis and assess for complications, followed by ECG and ambulatory monitoring to evaluate for arrhythmias. Management includes stopping stimulants, initiating beta-blocker therapy, and regular follow-up with cardiology.

Since the earliest descriptions of the condition, controversy has prevailed as to the existence of as well as appropriate management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Often diagnosed in childhood, symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder can continue into adolescence and adulthood, requiring lifelong therapy. Effective therapeutic interventions include stimulant medications with all their respective potential side effects, including the cardiovascular system. However, although initial studies raised concerns for an increase in serious adverse cardiovascular effects among children receiving these drugs, more recent and extensive reports have failed to substantiate those findings among young patients.

5.7 Cardiovascular Events

In modafinil clinical studies, cardiovascular adverse reactions, including chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, and transient ischemic T-wave changes on ECG occurred in three subjects in association with mitral valve prolapse or left ventricular hypertrophy. In a Canadian clinical trial, a 35 year old obese narcoleptic male with a prior history of syncopal episodes experienced a 9-second episode of asystole after 27 days of modafinil treatment (300 mg/day in divided doses). PROVIGIL is not recommended in patients with a history of left ventricular hypertrophy or in patients with mitral valve prolapse who have experienced the mitral valve prolapse syndrome when previously receiving CNS stimulants. Findings suggestive of mitral valve prolapse syndrome include but are not limited to ischemic ECG changes, chest pain, or arrhythmia. If new onset of any of these findings occurs, consider cardiac evaluation. Consider increased monitoring in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable angina.

Blood pressure monitoring in short term (≤ 3 months) controlled trials showed no clinically significant changes in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients receiving PROVIGIL as compared to placebo. However, a retrospective analysis of the use of antihypertensive medication in these studies showed that a greater proportion of patients on PROVIGIL required new or increased use of antihypertensive medications (2.4%) compared to patients on placebo (0.7%). The differential use was slightly larger when only studies in OSA were included, with 3.4% of patients on PROVIGIL and 1.1% of patients on placebo requiring such alterations in the use of antihypertensive medication. Increased monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure may be appropriate in patients on PROVIGIL. Caution should be exercised when prescribing PROVIGIL to patients with known cardiovascular disease.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Ventricular arrhythmia (VA) evaluation — history, family history, medication review, and examination elements are detailed, including arrhythmia symptoms (palpitations, lightheadedness, syncope, dyspnea, chest pain, cardiac arrest) and symptoms of underlying heart disease (dyspnea at rest or on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, chest pain, edema), precipitating factors (exercise, emotional stress), known heart disease (coronary, valvular such as mitral valve prolapse, congenital), and risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, smoking). Medication review encompasses antiarrhythmic and other medications with potential for QT prolongation and torsades de pointes, medications with potential to provoke or aggravate VA, stimulants including cocaine and amphetamines, supplements including anabolic steroids, and medication‑medication interactions that could cause QT prolongation and torsades de pointes. Family history elements include SCD, SCA, or unexplained drowning in a first-degree relative; SIDS or repetitive spontaneous pregnancy losses; and heart disease with inherited conditions such as cardiomyopathy (hypertrophic, dilated, ARVC), congenital heart disease, cardiac channelopathies (Long QT, Brugada, Short QT, CPVT), arrhythmias, and conduction disorders or devices. Physical examination focuses on heart rate and regularity, blood pressure, jugular venous pressure, murmurs, pulses and bruits, edema, and sternotomy scars. The text also notes that obtaining a complete medication history is important, that various antiarrhythmic and other medications can cause QT prolongation and torsades de pointes, and that some medications can also induce Brugada type I electrocardiographic pattern and VF.

5.7 Cardiovascular Events

In clinical studies of modafinil, cardiovascular adverse reactions, including chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea and transient ischemic T-wave changes on ECG were observed in three subjects in association with mitral valve prolapse or left ventricular hypertrophy. It is recommended that armodafinil tablets not be used in patients with a history of left ventricular hypertrophy or in patients with mitral valve prolapse who have experienced the mitral valve prolapse syndrome when previously receiving CNS stimulants. Findings suggestive of mitral valve prolapse syndrome include but are not limited to ischemic ECG changes, chest pain, or arrhythmia. If new onset of any of these findings occurs, consider cardiac evaluation.

Blood pressure monitoring in short term (≤ 3 months) pre-approval controlled trials of OSA, SWD, and narcolepsy showed small average increases in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients receiving armodafinil as compared to placebo (1.2 to 4.3 mmHg in the various experimental groups). There was also a slightly greater proportion of patients on armodafinil requiring new or increased use of antihypertensive medications (2.9%) compared to patients on placebo (1.8%). There was a small, but consistent, average increase in pulse rate over placebo in pre-approval controlled trials. This increase varied from 0.9 to 3.5 BPM. Increased monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure may be appropriate in patients on armodafinil. Caution should be exercised when prescribing armodafinil to patients with known cardiovascular disease.

### Paying attention to attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder medications and cardiovascular risk… [^113W74kC]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Zhang, et al1 performed a meta-analysis of 19 observational studies with more than 3. 9 million participants followed from 3 months to
9. 5 years and found no association between use of medications to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and any cardiovascular disease outcome. This is an important study for many reasons. First, the possibility that medications used to treat ADHD might adversely affect the risk of CVD has biological plausibility. Many ADHD medications are stimulants with important sympathomimetic effects and can increase heart rate and blood pressure and potentially increase the risk of arrhythmias, especially in susceptible individuals, such as those with preexisting CVD. Second, the use of ADHD medications is increasing in both children and adults. Finally, as ADHD medication use increases among older adults, the likelihood that individuals with preexisting CVD will be exposed to these medications increases as well.

The authors highlight the possibility that CVD risk in ADHD medication users may be elevated in women compared with men as well as in those with preexisting CVD vs those without, even though they note wide and overlapping confidence intervals. With this important caveat, it would have also been appropriate to emphasize the potential of increased risk in older adults compared with young and middle-aged adults. Tadrous et al5 found that prescription stimulant use was associated with an increased risk of a CVD event at 30 days, with a hazard ratio of 3. 0 for ventricular arrhythmias and an HR of

1. 6 for stroke or transient ischemic attack.

Every treatment decision is a balance of potential harm and potential benefit, and that balance is different for every individual patient based on their biological variability and on "personomics, "7 ie, other important differences in psychological, social, cultural, behavioral, and economic factors and each individual's unique life circumstances. Although the study by Zhang et al1 is reassuring in many ways, health care professionals must carefully weigh these factors when prescribing ADHD medications, especially to older adults, individuals with established CVD, and those with other comorbidities that increase CVD risk.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^111F6Ru4]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Stimulant medications — common adverse effects, growth impact, and cardiovascular evaluation are as follows: Common short-term adverse effects are appetite loss, abdominal pain, headaches, and sleep disturbance. Diminished growth was in the range of 1 to 2 cm from predicted adult height, and the effects diminished by the third year of treatment, with no compensatory rebound growth observed. On average, stimulants increase heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) mildly (average increases: 1–2 beats per minute for HR and 1–4 mm Hg for systolic and diastolic BP), but more substantial increases can occur in a subset of individuals (5%–15%), so clinicians are encouraged to monitor these vital signs. Stimulant medications have not been shown to increase the risk of sudden death beyond that observed in children not receiving stimulants, yet before initiating therapy it is important to obtain the child or adolescent's cardiac history and family history of specific conditions; if any of these risk factors are present, clinicians should obtain additional evaluation. An uncommon significant adverse effect is the occurrence of hallucinations and other psychotic symptoms.

### Floppy mitral valve / mitral valve prolapse: a complex entity with multiple genotypes and phenotypes [^111R1p9k]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Floppy mitral valve/mitral valve prolapse (FMV/MVP) is a common valvular abnormality affecting 2% to 3% of the general population. It occurs in a heterogeneous group of patients with varying and age dependent expressions. FMV/MVP can be familial or sporadic, isolated (called non-syndromic) or as a part of a well-defined syndrome of heritable connective tissue disorders or other diseases. A wide range of phenotypic expression exists ranging from asymptomatic to non-specific symptoms related to neuroendocrine or autonomic nervous system functional abnormalities, varying degrees of mitral regurgitation that may require interventional therapy, heart failure, infective endocarditis, cardiac arrhythmias and/or sudden cardiac death. FMV/MVP is predominantly considered a heritable disorder with clinical manifestations not present at birth, but appearing later in life. Though a variant gene may initiate the development of FMV/MVP, precise phenotypic expression may be related to multiple other molecular, genetic and epigenetic factors that modify the final expression of the disease. A better understanding of these mechanisms will help to better define the natural history of the disease, inhibit disease progression and even prevent the phenotypic expression of FMV/MVP.

### Mitral valve prolapse and its motley crew-syndromic prevalence, pathophysiology, and progression of a common heart condition [^115CBWRh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment for malignant ventricular arrhythmias in patients with MVP follows the standard of care for all patients who experience life threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Ablation procedures have been used successfully to treat ventricular arrhythmias in patients with MVP, but recurrent ventricular arrhythmias can re‐emerge in patients treated with this technology. Internal cardioverter defibrillator implantation is often used in these patients for additional prophylaxis, and has been shown to successfully manage subsequent ventricular arrhythmias in some, but not all patients. However, these therapies only work in patients who survive out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest, of which only 8.4% of patients do, on average. More work needs to be done to better understand why some patients with hemodynamically benign MVP are at high risk for ventricular arrhythmias and SCD.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for stimulant use disorder, more specifically with respect to evaluation of intoxication and withdrawal (clinical assessment), AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain clinical evaluation to identify any acute concerns and complications of stimulant intoxication or withdrawal, including an assessment for hyperadrenergic symptoms such as tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, and agitation, that may necessitate a higher level of care.

### 2017 AHA / ACC / HRS guideline for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^112Xc1vW]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Clinical assessment for ventricular arrhythmia (VA) emphasizes that symptoms, particularly in patients with known or discovered structural or electrical heart disease, should prompt focused investigation; identifying precipitating factors and family history is important; and medication review is essential because drugs can provoke arrhythmias. The text states that various antiarrhythmic and other medications can cause QT prolongation and torsades de pointes, and some medications can induce a Brugada type I electrocardiographic pattern and VF. Patients with bigeminy or trigeminy can present with effective bradycardia, an apical‑radial pulse deficit, and relative hypertension with a wide pulse pressure, and premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) can lead to inaccurate estimation of heart rate. Physical findings that suggest structural heart disease include carotid bruits or diminished peripheral pulses (atherosclerotic disease associated with ischemic heart disease); jugular venous distention, rales, gallops, and peripheral edema (evidence of HF); cardiac murmurs such as those of aortic stenosis or mitral regurgitation (associated with HF and VA); and a midsystolic click indicating mitral valve prolapse that can be associated with VA. Many VA are asymptomatic and detected only on an ECG or telemetry, underscoring the need to search for evidence of underlying heart disease.

Regarding medical management for stimulant use disorder, more specifically with respect to management of cardiomyopathy, AHA 2016 guidelines recommend to consider initiating nonselective β-blocker therapy with α-1, β-1, or β-2 receptor antagonism in patients at risk for relapse of cocaine abuse because of the potential protection against the unopposed α-agonism effects of cocaine with β-1 receptor antagonist treatment alone.

### Mitral valve prolapse and its motley crew-syndromic prevalence, pathophysiology, and progression of a common heart condition [^114YWTVR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Over the past 20 years, our understanding of MVP has evolved considerably. Precise definition of the disorder has allowed for large, population level studies to occur which have shown that even though MVP is a common and often benign entity, the lifetime cardiovascular risk of patients with MVP is both substantial and diverse. Through the hard work of many clinical and basic science researchers, genetic causes of MVP have been identified, and animal models of MVP have been developed which allow in‐depth investigation of the molecular drivers of mitral valve enlargement, myxomatous tissue formation, and prolapse. With these tools, future investigations can focus on how MVP progresses beyond the valve, to the ventricle, and whether new studies may inform revised clinical guidelines or application of rationale remedial therapies to blunt disease progression or severity.

Findings in Non‐iMVP

As described, there was a subset of patients with SCD and MVP but also other cardiac abnormalities.

SCD is likely attributable to significant coronary artery disease, dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Brugada syndrome, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy in cases with these coexistent conditions.

Other coexistent findings are more contentious. Anatomical findings such as mild left ventricular hypertrophy or cardiomegaly at autopsy have been described in relation to MVP 69 and could indicate that pathological changes of the ventricle in otherwise "iMVP" is a contributor to SCD events. Additionally, 13 patients were taking antiarrhythmic medications. It is prudent to consider that while these medications in themselves may have proarrhythmic side effects, these medications were likely administered to treat preexisting VAs in the cases. Finally, findings of prolonged QTc may also reflect underlying repolarization abnormalities in patients with MVP, which has also been previously described. 48, 51.

Results

Family history

A family was referred to us with non-syndromic early onset multivalvular disease. The mother reported that her husband had severe aortic valve and mitral annulus calcification diagnosed at the age of 38. He had succumbed from the disease at 58 after several cardiac surgeries. The severe multivalvular phenotype at this young age remained unexplained. After her husband passed away, her 26-year-old son (proband) and a 23-year-old daughter, underwent an echocardiography screening. He had normal appearance with no sign of premature aging, skin disease, or dysmorphic feature. However, the transthoracic echocardiography revealed isolated mild aortic valve stenosis (aortic valve area of 1.39 cm 2, transvalvular peak velocity of 2.1 m/s, and transvalvular peak and mean gradients of 18 and 11 mmHg, respectively) and mild mitral valve regurgitation likely related to leaflet thickening. The thickness of the anterior mitral leaflet was 4.7 mm (Figure 1). The left ventricular ejection fraction (56%) and left ventricular end diastolic diameter (50.1 mm) were preserved. The echocardiography findings mirrored the phenotype documented in his father's medical record. The proband's mother, sister, and paternal aunt had normal echocardiogram. None of the family members displayed features of a dilated cardiomyopathy or atrioventricular conduction defects. The clinical presentation suggested an autosomal-dominant inheritance. A genetic investigation was thus initiated to identify the molecular cause of valve disease. Accordingly, the son in this report is considered the proband (Figure 1). A two-step strategy was used to identify the genetic etiology, first testing candidate genes and then whole-exome sequencing (WES).

Assessing Cardiovascular Status in Patients being Treated with Stimulant Medications

Children, adolescents, or adults who are being considered for treatment with stimulant medications should have a careful history (including assessment for a family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia) and physical exam to assess for the presence of cardiac disease, and should receive further cardiac evaluation if findings suggest such disease (e.g., electrocardiogram and echocardiogram). Patients who develop symptoms such as exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or other symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease during stimulant treatment should undergo a prompt cardiac evaluation.

Psychiatric Adverse Events

Pre-Existing Psychosis – Administration of stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a pre-existing psychotic disorder.

Bipolar Illness – Particular care should be taken in using stimulants to treat ADHD in patients with comorbid bipolar disorder because of concern for possible induction of a mixed/manic episode in such patients. Prior to initiating treatment with a stimulant, patients with comorbid depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression.

Emergence of New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms – Treatment emergent psychotic or manic symptoms, e.g., hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania in children and adolescents without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania can be caused by stimulants at usual doses. If such symptoms occur, consideration should be given to a possible causal role of the stimulant, and discontinuation of treatment may be appropriate. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies, such symptoms occurred in about 0.1% (4 patients with events out of 3482 exposed to methylphenidate or amphetamine for several weeks at usual doses) of stimulant-treated patients compared to 0 in placebo-treated patients.

ADHD in athletes — cardiac testing and therapy considerations (AMSSM position): There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine EKG or additional cardiac testing in athletes without cardiac disease on medications for ADHD, except for the athlete on a tricyclic antidepressant. If an athlete on stimulants is at risk for cardiac disease, as defined by history, family history, or physical exam, or a screening EKG, further workup/consultation is warranted. If an athlete is on stimulants and found to have a cardiac disease, alternative therapy should be strongly considered (SOR C).

### Risk of cardiovascular diseases associated with medications used in attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1161d9kc]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

We found that the risk of cardiovascular events associated with ADHD medications seemed to be higher among those with preexisting CVD compared with no prior CVD, although the findings did not reach the threshold for statistical significance. This coincides with raising concerns that individuals with congenital or acquired CVD are predisposed to additional risk. Despite the lack of data supporting CVD history as a contraindication for ADHD medications, the FDA labeling includes a warning on the use of ADHD medications among individuals with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems. Current treatment guidelines generally recommend carefully assessing patients with ADHD (eg, personal and family history of CVD, physical examination, electrocardiogram) and identifying individuals at risk before initiating ADHD medications. Careful monitoring should also be performed after initiation. Further studies focusing on the potential modifying risk of preexisting CVD, ideally separating risks for congenital or acquired CVD, are warranted. Clinical guidelines on prescribing ADHD medications among high-risk individuals should be updated once further evidence is available. We also found the point estimates for risk of CVD seemed to be higher among female compared with male patients, although only 3 studies have examined the sex-specific association along with high heterogeneity between studies. Previous research has shown that females with ADHD have somewhat different patterns of comorbidities, and response to stimulantsthan males, and additional research is needed to examine this potential sex difference.

### Mitral valve prolapse and sudden cardiac death: a systematic review [^113qS1u3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical Characteristics in iMVP and SCD

Clinical characteristics of the cases are summarized in Table 1. The age‐sex distribution of the index event of cardiac arrest or death is illustrated in Figure 2.

Table 1
Baseline Characteristics in Cases of MVP and SCD or Cardiac Arrest

Figure 2
Age at time of death or cardiac arrest in mitral valve prolapse according to sex.

For patients with iMVP, the median age was 30 years (range 6 to 79 years), female sex accounted for 69% of cases, and 61% were SCD cases. The median age for female cases was 28 (IQR, 24–41) years and the median age for male cases was 39 (IQR, 28–53) years. Two cases occurred in individuals younger than 10 (ages 6 and 7), and a further 6 cases in individuals between 10 and 18 years. Activity at the time of cardiac arrest included routine daily activities (46%), exertion related (23%), emotional stress (5%), sleeping (7%), driving (5%), and pregnancy related (4%). Seven cases had cardiac arrest while in the hospital, with 5 occurring in the setting of general anesthesia.

Preceding symptoms included palpitations (58%), syncope (29%), chest pain (31%), dizziness (23%), and fatigue (8%). Only 21% of patients were reported to be asymptomatic before the index event. Three cases had a history of cardiac arrest, although none of these cases overlapped with those who had prior syncope.

Prior medication use was reported in 32 cases, of which 8 (25%) involved patients taking either a β‐blocker or digoxin at the time of cardiac arrest or SCD and 50% who were not taking any medications. One patient was taking multiple psychotropic medications, 21 while another case described MVP and SCD in a patient with markedly elevated concentrations of caffeine (from an energy supplement). 22

A positive family history for SCD was reported in 14% of cases. One case described a possible familial cluster of malignant MVP involving a 14‐year‐old female with SCD and iMVP, 3 first‐degree relatives with SCD (mother aged 36, sister aged 11, and brother aged 12 years who had thickening of his MV) and 3 of 7 remaining siblings with MVP. 8

### Mitral valve prolapse and its motley crew-syndromic prevalence, pathophysiology, and progression of a common heart condition [^1137JmgD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Although we have long appreciated the association between MVP with significant regurgitation and the development of ventricular arrhythmias, it is becoming evident that regurgitation does not have to be present or severe to increase the risk for SCD. Several recent studies have identified a subset of patients with MVP that have little to no regurgitation, but have a significantly elevated incidence of ventricular arrhythmias, including sudden death. The patients described in these reports display a remarkably similar phenotype; young, female, bileaflet MVP without significant regurgitation, a mid‐systolic click on cardiac auscultation, presence of mitral annulus disjunction, signs of cardiac fibrosis observed on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, a high burden of premature ventricular contractions, and increased rates of nonsustained and sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and cardiac arrest.

A proposed mechanism for this "arrhythmogenic mitral valve prolapse syndrome" has begun to emerge. The baseline finding is mitral annulus disjunction, which is an echocardiographic and morphologic finding characterized by increased distance between the atrial mitral valve attachment and the left ventricular attachment. This abnormality allows for increased mechanical stress on the annulus and leads to irregular curling motion of the mitral valve annulus during systole, in turn increasing the mitral valve annulus diameter during systole. Myxomatous degeneration, in combination with these abnormal stressors on the annulus, leads to increases in mechanical stress on the inferobasal myocardial wall, as well as on the papillary muscles through the chordae tendineae. These stressors increase fibrogenesis in the myocardium, providing the substrate for ventricular arrhythmogenesis through the well documented effects on cardiomyocyte electrical conduction in the context of fibrosis. At the same time, an increase in the observance in PVCs are seen in patients with MVP. Electrophysiologic mapping in these patients has demonstrated that these originate most frequently in the papillary muscles, as well as the fascicles, and the left ventricular outflow tract. Purkinje tissue in these zones appears to be the trigger for ventricular ectopic beats, and has been theorized to result from either mechanical stretch of the cells as a result of direct mechanical forces from the mitral leaflet on the myocardium, or because of aberrant electrical activity in damaged cells as a result of abnormal calcium handling and the evocation of delayed afterdepolarizations. Together, these provide the substrate (fibrosis and altered electrical conductivity of the myocardium), and trigger (PVCs) for reentrant circuits to develop, causing malignant ventricular arrhythmias.

### Mitral valve prolapse [^117MyyQL]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Mitral valve prolapse is a common valvular abnormality that is the most common cause of severe non-ischaemic mitral regurgitation in the USA. The overall prognosis of patients with mitral valve prolapse is excellent, but a small subset will develop serious complications, including infective endocarditis, sudden cardiac death, and severe mitral regurgitation. We present a comprehensive review of mitral valve prolapse, examining normal mitral anatomy, the clinical and echocardiographic features of mitral valve prolapse, and the pathophysiology and genetics of the disorder. We discuss the contemporary management of both asymptomatic and symptomatic prolapse, with particular attention to the timing and technique of surgical repair. We conclude that echocardiography is the method of choice for diagnosing mitral valve prolapse, that clinical and echocardiographic features can predict which patients with prolapse are at highest risk for complications, and that mitral valve repair is the treatment of choice for symptomatic prolapse.

Clinical Characteristics of MVP

A diagnosis of MVP is not reliably made using clinical symptoms. In fact, patients with MVP appear to exhibit symptoms that have been previously attributed to MVP (dyspnea, chest pain, and electrocardiographic abnormalities) at an equivalent rate to patients without any identifiable prolapse. Even patients with quite severe regurgitation as a result of prolapse may be asymptomatic. As such, symptoms should not be used to diagnose MVP, although the presence of symptoms warrant further investigation. Physical exam findings that are associated with MVP include a lower body mass index and a mid‐systolic "click" heard best at the apex on cardiac auscultation. A late systolic or holosystolic murmur may be appreciated as well, and suggests the presence of mitral regurgitation. Thoracic, or bony abnormalities, as well as other extra‐cardiac findings may suggest the presence of MVP as part of a syndrome. Physical exam findings should also not be used to diagnose MVP, as the presence of any of these findings are not sensitive or specific enough to accurately make a diagnosis. Echocardiography is the gold standard for diagnosis, as it provides a high‐resolution and dynamic view of the three‐dimensional mitral valve, can quantify leaflet involvement, and is able to detect and quantify characteristics of more severe disease, such as annulus dilation, flail leaflet because of chordal rupture, and severity of regurgitation. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging may also have a place in the MVP workup, as it is exquisitely sensitive and specific, and is able to uniquely detect and quantify fibrosis in patients with MVP by measuring late gadolinium enhancement. Electrocardiography or 24‐hour Holter monitoring may also provide utility in the workup of MVP, as both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias may arise in these patients. Patients who experience an increased burden of premature ectopic beats (such as premature ventricular contractions [PVCs]) are at an increased risk of developing more severe, even life‐threatening arrhythmias. Many studies have reported a high PVC burden in patients with MVP. In a recent review of patients with MVP who experienced sudden cardiac death, 92% experienced PVCs on Holter monitoring, and in another electrophysiologic study, PVCs were identified as a trigger for more complex, life threatening arrhythmias in patients with MVP. As such, there is an opportunity to risk stratify patients with MVP using Holter monitoring, to identify subsets of patients who are at an increased risk for sudden cardiac death.

### Attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder, stimulant therapy, and the patient with congenital heart disease: evidence and reason [^114gN4EY]. Pediatric Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurobehavioral disorder of childhood, and congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common form of birth defect. Children with CHD are at increased risk for neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD. Stimulant medications, specifically methylphenidates and amphetamines, are frequently prescribed and effective in reducing the symptoms of ADHD. Despite their efficacy and long history of use, the safety of these medications has recently come into question due to isolated reports describing sudden unexplained death of children undergoing treatment. This review summarizes the current literature on the cardiovascular risks associated with the use of pharmacologic therapy for ADHD, with an emphasis on patients who had CHD.

Clinical Introduction

A 52-year-old woman with shortness of breath and palpitations was referred to a cardiologist. A 24-hour Holter demonstrated high density (37%) of ventricular premature beats (VPBs) and long runs of non-sustained (eventually sustained) monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) with the same morphology as several VPBs detected in a 12-lead ECG (figure 1A). A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, and the patient's evaluation was completed with a functional and gadolinium-enhanced cardiovascular MR (CMR) study (figure 1B, C) to assess structural heart disease. In a follow-up visit, an electrophysiological study (EPS) was performed to identify the origin of VPBs and VT (figure 1D).heartjnl;104/24/2025/F1F1F1Figure 1(A) A 12-lead ECG.

### Mitral valve prolapse and its motley crew-syndromic prevalence, pathophysiology, and progression of a common heart condition [^116CWYN5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Recently, a cilia gene, DZIP1, which encodes DAZ interacting zinc finger protein 1, was identified as a causal gene for nonsyndromic autosomal dominant MVP in humans. A deleterious missense mutation in DZIP1 segregates with MVP in a large family pedigree. Mice with a similar missense mutation knocked in to their DZIP1 locus develop functional MVP with evidence of defects in ciliogenesis during development. Population burden tests using previously performed GWAS data sets revealed a bias towards primary cilia genes as contributing to disease phenotype. Together, these findings implicate MVP as originating from development defects as well as the disease being considered a ciliopathy. However, because of its genetic and clinical heterogeneity, additional studies need to be done to determine how many cases of MVP are a result of impaired ciliogenesis.

Serious Cardiovascular Events

Sudden Death And Pre-existing Structural Cardiac Abnormalities Or Other Serious Heart Problems

Children And Adolescents

Sudden death has been reported in association with CNS stimulant treatment at usual doses in children and adolescents with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems. Although some serious heart problems alone carry an increased risk of sudden death, stimulant products generally should not be used in children or adolescents with known serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, or other serious cardiac problems that may place them at increased vulnerability to the sympathomimetic effects of a stimulant drug (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Adults

Sudden deaths, stroke, and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults taking stimulant drugs at usual doses for ADHD. Although the role of stimulants in these adult cases is also unknown, adults have a greater likelihood than children of having serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac problems. Adults with such abnormalities should also generally not be treated with stimulant drugs (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Hypertension And Other Cardiovascular Conditions

Stimulant medications cause a modest increase in average blood pressure (about 2–4 mmHg) and average heart rate (about 3–6 bpm), and individuals may have larger increases. While the mean changes alone would not be expected to have short-term consequences, all patients should be monitored for larger changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Caution is indicated in treating patients whose underlying medical conditions might be compromised by increases in blood pressure or heart rate, e.g., those with pre-existing hypertension, heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, or ventricular arrhythmia (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Assessing Cardiovascular Status In Patients Being Treated With Stimulant Medications

Children, adolescents, or adults who are being considered for treatment with stimulant medications should have a careful history (including assessment for a family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia) and physical exam to assess for the presence of cardiac disease, and should receive further cardiac evaluation if findings suggest such disease (e.g., electrocardiogram and echocardiogram). Patients who develop symptoms such as exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or other symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease during stimulant treatment should undergo a prompt cardiac evaluation.

### Safety review update of medications used to treat… [^113eT5JU]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

The U. S. Food and Drug Administration is updating its communication on the ongoing cardiovascular safety review of medications used for treating Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, many of which are known to increase heart rate and blood pressure. A large, recently-completed study that included one study that evaluated heart attacks and sudden deaths in a sample of adults, and a second study that assessed strokes in these adults, has not shown an increased risk of serious adverse cardiovascular events in adults treated with ADHD medications. In the two recently-completed epidemiologic studies, data were analyzed from over 440, 000 adults aged 25–64 years, including over 150, 000 adults treated with medications for ADHD. One study evaluated heart attacks and sudden cardiac deaths in this sample of adults, and the second study assessed strokes in these adults.

Together, these studies were designed to evaluate the potential increased risk of heart attack, sudden cardiac death, or stroke that could be associated with the use of ADHD medications. The adult study is being published in the. Blood pressure and heart rate increases have been observed in patients treated with the sympathomimetics methylphenidate and amphetamine, and with atomoxetine. In view of these effects, together with spontaneous postmarketing reports of serious cardiovascular events with use of ADHD drugs, FDA, in partnership with AHRQ, sponsored three related observational studies of serious cardiovascular events with drugs for ADHD.

One study assessed myocardial infarction, stroke, and sudden cardiac death with use of ADHD drugs by children and young adults aged 2–24 years; a second study assessed MI and SCD among non-elderly adult users; and the third study evaluated stroke in non-elderly adult users. The third study also included an analysis of a composite endpoint in adults.

### Misconceptions and facts about hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^111dxoF7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common genetic heart disease. Once considered relentless, untreatable, and deadly, it has become a highly treatable disease with contemporary management. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is one of cardiology's "great masqueraders". Mistakes and delays in diagnosis abound. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy commonly "masquerades" as asthma, anxiety, mitral prolapse, and coronary artery disease. However, once properly diagnosed, patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be effectively managed to improve both symptoms and survival. This review highlights some of the misconceptions about hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Providers at all levels should have awareness of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to promptly diagnose and properly manage these individuals.

Second, MVP can also cause left ventricular dysfunction, and systolic heart failure. Although patients with severe regurgitation, may have a completely "normal" ejection fraction, this doesn't reflect the true underlying hemodynamic alterations that are occurring. To do a quick calculation, in severe regurgitation (defined in the Framingham Heart Study as regurgitant jet area > 40% of the volume of the LA), assuming a normal left atrial volume index of ≈41 mL/m 2 for a male patient, ≈16 mL of blood would be regurgitated with each beat of the ventricle. Assuming a normal ventricular stroke volume index of 65 mL/m 2, ≈25% of the blood ejected from the heart each beat is flowing from LV to LA. This implies that only 75% of the blood ejected with each beat makes it to systemic circulation, and therefore, the cardiac output has to increase 33% to pump enough blood in the forward direction to meet the body's metabolic demands. The initial response by the LV is a compensatory increase in left ventricular end‐diastolic volume and force of contraction supported by the frank starling mechanism, but chronically, this volume overload causes increased LV wall stress, LV hypertrophy, fibrosis, increases in LV afterload, and a gradually worsening systolic function. The best evidence that ventricular systolic dysfunction exists in patients with severe mitral regurgitation is the acute decline in ejection fraction that occurs in patients just after mitral valve surgery. Even further, patients with impaired preoperative ejection fraction had a much more drastic reduction in ejection fraction with their operation, and patients with a more significant reduction in ejection fraction carried a worse prognosis. In a prospective study of asymptomatic patients with severe mitral regurgitation, immediate surgical correction was compared with a conventional treatment strategy that waited to perform surgery until they developed symptoms (exertional dyspnea), or they experienced a declination in ejection fraction (< 60), an increase in LV end systolic diameter (> 45 mm), AF, or pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary arterial pressure > 50 mm Hg). In follow‐up, conventional management resulted in an estimated actuarial 7‐year cardiac mortality rate of 5%, compared with 0% with immediate surgery. As such, the 2017 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology focused update on the management of valvular heart disease guidelines state that surgical intervention in a patient with a normal ejection fractionF (> 60%) who has increasing LV size or worsening ejection fractionF is reasonable, since an ejection fractionF < 60% indicates these patients are already in LV dysfunction.

Data from the Pediatric Heart Network Marfan trial revealed that ADHD significantly impacts health-related quality of life in children and young adults with MFS. The US Food and Drug Administration–approved drugs for treatment of ADHD include stimulant drugs (amphetamine and methylphenidate) and non-stimulant drugs (atomoxetine, clonidine, and guanfacine). The European Medicines Agency has not approved the use of clonidine but has a waiver for the use of prolonged clonidine release for paediatric patients. Stimulant drugs and atomoxetine may produce a mild increase in heart rate and blood pressure and could delay ventricular repolarization. Conversely, clonidine and guanfacine may reduce heart rate and blood pressure. Treatment decisions for ADHD in children with MFS should be made case-by-case. Non-stimulant drugs are considered safer but sometimes less-effective. When stimulant drugs are needed, usual caution and control of the heart rate and blood pressure as per standard guidance is warranted with cessation of the drug if hypertension is detected.

### Mitral valve prolapse and its motley crew-syndromic prevalence, pathophysiology, and progression of a common heart condition [^111F6ZJY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a commonly occurring heart condition defined by enlargement and superior displacement of the mitral valve leaflet(s) during systole. Although commonly seen as a standalone disorder, MVP has also been described in case reports and small studies of patients with various genetic syndromes. In this review, we analyzed the prevalence of MVP within syndromes where an association to MVP has previously been reported. We further discussed the shared biological pathways that cause MVP in these syndromes, as well as how MVP in turn causes a diverse array of cardiac and noncardiac complications. We found 105 studies that identified patients with mitral valve anomalies within 18 different genetic, developmental, and connective tissue diseases. We show that some disorders previously believed to have an increased prevalence of MVP, including osteogenesis imperfecta, fragile X syndrome, Down syndrome, and Pseudoxanthoma elasticum, have few to no studies that use up-to-date diagnostic criteria for the disease and therefore may be overestimating the prevalence of MVP within the syndrome. Additionally, we highlight that in contrast to early studies describing MVP as a benign entity, the clinical course experienced by patients can be heterogeneous and may cause significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Currently only surgical correction of MVP is curative, but it is reserved for severe cases in which irreversible complications of MVP may already be established; therefore, a review of clinical guidelines to allow for earlier surgical intervention may be warranted to lower cardiovascular risk in patients with MVP.

Abstract

Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a commonly occurring heart condition defined by enlargement and superior displacement of the mitral valve leaflet(s) during systole. Although commonly seen as a standalone disorder, MVP has also been described in case reports and small studies of patients with various genetic syndromes. In this review, we analyzed the prevalence of MVP within syndromes where an association to MVP has previously been reported. We further discussed the shared biological pathways that cause MVP in these syndromes, as well as how MVP in turn causes a diverse array of cardiac and noncardiac complications. We found 105 studies that identified patients with mitral valve anomalies within 18 different genetic, developmental, and connective tissue diseases. We show that some disorders previously believed to have an increased prevalence of MVP, including osteogenesis imperfecta, fragile X syndrome, Down syndrome, and Pseudoxanthoma elasticum, have few to no studies that use up‐to‐date diagnostic criteria for the disease and therefore may be overestimating the prevalence of MVP within the syndrome. Additionally, we highlight that in contrast to early studies describing MVP as a benign entity, the clinical course experienced by patients can be heterogeneous and may cause significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Currently only surgical correction of MVP is curative, but it is reserved for severe cases in which irreversible complications of MVP may already be established; therefore, a review of clinical guidelines to allow for earlier surgical intervention may be warranted to lower cardiovascular risk in patients with MVP.

Ehlers‐Danlos Syndrome

Ehlers‐Danlos syndrome (EDS) refers to a heterogeneous group of connective tissue disorders that share some common clinical phenotypes, including joint hypermobility, tissue fragility, and skin hyperextensibility. Currently, 13 subtypes of EDS have been identified. Most subtypes of EDS are diagnosed using genetic testing, however, hypermobile EDS, the most common EDS subtype, has no identified genetic cause. Hypermobile EDS is therefore diagnosed using clinical criteria, which may obfuscate more mild cases and prevent a definitive diagnosis. Although initial discoveries implicated mutations in fibrillar collagen as the cause, subsequent studies on patients with EDS have identified many genes that cause different subtypes of EDS, and are important for collagen biosynthesis and processing, proteoglycan synthesis, and innate immunity. Thus, EDS, though often taught to be a disorder of impaired collagen production to medical students, is significantly more diverse and mechanistically much more complicated.

In addition to many musculoskeletal, autonomic, neurologic, gastrointestinal, and psychiatric manifestations that are seen in patients with EDS, cardiac and vascular manifestations may also be seen. Cardiovascular manifestations are common with subtypes of EDS, in particular vascular EDS, a hallmark of which is brittle vasculature, putting patients at risk of arterial rupture. Furthermore, a report identified a cardiac valvular subtype of EDS, in which a series of patients with a collagen type 1 alpha 2 chain mutation were diagnosed with EDS or other similar connective tissue disorders, all of whom had cardiac valvular involvement. Cardiac involvement in most other subtypes of EDS is thought to be uncommon, but has been reported in previous literature. MVP is mildly enriched in patients with EDS compared with the general population; in studies included in this review, the median prevalence of MVP was 6.2% (range, 2.6%–66.7%) in patients with a diagnosis of EDS with no further classification of subtype (Figure S1).

### Out of the frying pan, into the fire: a case of heat shock and its fatal complications [^115FXeJh]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2014). Low credibility.

Exertional heat stroke incidence is on the rise and has become the third leading cause of death in high school athletes. It is entirely preventable, yet this is a case of a 15-year-old, 97-kg male football player who presented unresponsive and hyperthermic after an August football practice. His blood pressure was 80/30, and his pulse was 180. He had a rectal temperature of 107.3°F, and upon entering the emergency department, he was rapidly cooled in 40 minutes. As he progressed, he developed metabolic acidosis, elevated liver enzymes, a prolapsed mitral valve with elevated troponin levels, and worsening hypotension even with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. After 3 days in the hospital, this young man was pronounced dead as a result of complications from exertional heat stroke. We address not only the complications of his hospital course relative to his positive blood cultures but also the complications that can result from attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medication our patient was taking. As the population of young adults becomes more obese and more highly medicated for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, we sought out these growing trends in correlation with the increase in incidence of heat-related illness. We also address the predisposing factors that make young high school athletes more likely to experience heat illness and propose further steps to educate this susceptible population.

Cardiovascular considerations for stimulant use in athletes — methylphenidate elevated heart rate by 11 beats per minute in methylphenidate-naïve patients compared to 4 beats per minute with continued use, and the clinical significance of a 1–5 mmHg blood pressure increase is disputed. No clinically significant difference was found in the risk between methylphenidate and amphetamine salts, and sudden cardiac death is rare among athletes. Team Physicians should refrain from prescribing stimulants to children with pre-existing heart disease or symptoms consistent with cardiovascular disease, but because estimated rates of sudden death in stimulant-treated ADHD patients do not exceed those of the general population, team physicians should not refrain from treating athletes with stimulants because of concerns about sudden death. The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends monitoring blood pressure and heart rate and obtaining EKGs with nearly all medicine treatments of ADHD — stimulant and nonstimulant, whereas the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) did not support the routine use of EKGs before initiating stimulant therapy and contends there is no proof of increased rates of SCD in patients taking medications for ADHD. It remains prudent for Team Physicians to periodically monitor blood pressure, heart rate, and exertional symptoms in athletes treated for ADHD.

### ADHD risk reduction | AAFP… [^115G5PyD]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

While many adults with ADHD are able to cope with their symptoms, studies have shown that ADHD is associated with: Medication treatment risks usually relate to one or more of the following categories: Stimulant and related medications are generally well tolerated. Stimulant side effects are usually mild and respond to waiting, adjustment of dose, timing, or change in medication. Stimulant products have a high potential for abuse. Stimulant products carry cardiovascular side effects, including tachycardia, palpitations, and blood pressure elevations. As a result, blood pressure should be monitored in those even with mild hypertension. Uncontrolled hypertension should be controlled prior to starting stimulant therapy. Warnings exist with stimulants regarding the potential risk of serious cardiovascular events, of sudden death with use in those with pre-existing structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems.

Additional adverse reactions with stimulants include insomnia, decreased appetite with possible weight loss, overstimulation, restlessness, dry mouth, unpleasant taste, diarrhea, and constipation. The amphetamine group is also associated with dizziness, euphoria, dyskinesia, tremor, exacerbations of motor and phonic tics, and Tourette's syndrome. Clinical evaluation and review of family history for tics and Tourette's syndrome should precede use of stimulant medication. However, treatment in these studies did not result in normalization. Studies also found that ADHD medications reduce ADHD symptoms and impairments, but that there is limited and inconsistent evidence for long-term medication effects on improved social functioning, academic achievement, employment status, and psychiatric comorbidity.

Although some studies show an association between ADHD and suicidality, depression, and substance use disorder, some emerging evidence suggests that these co-occurrence could be due to shared familial risk factors rather than to harmful effects of ADHD medications. Stimulant products and atomoxetine should generally not be used in patients with serious heart problems, or for whom an increase in blood pressure or heart rate would be problematic. Periodically monitor patients for changes in heart rate and blood pressure Stimulant products are contraindicated for persons with the following co-existing conditions: Universal-precautions should be applied to all adult ADHD patients for whom stimulants are being considered. Universal-precautions include: Assume all patients are at risk of misuse, abuse, diversion, or having their medications stolen. Physicians should prescribe agents with less potential for abuse and monitor patients more intensely.

Short-acting stimulant medications are the most likely to be abused and longer-acting stimulant medications less likely to be abused.

### Diagnosis and clinical presentation of two individuals with a rarepathogenic variant [^116Xq2eC]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

TCF20 -associated neurodevelopmental disorder (TAND) is a rare and phenotypically variable genetic condition. Common features include intellectual disability, neurobehavioural concerns, postnatal tall stature and hypotonia. Two unrelated early adolescent males were referred to genetics for assessment of developmental delay. The first male of Caucasian descent had a history of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), mitral valve prolapse and subtle craniofacial dysmorphisms. The second male of Somali descent had a history of intellectual disability, thick corpus callosum and ASD. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a pathogenic variant in TCF20 in both individuals. Further testing revealed that the former individual's mother was mosaic for the TCF2 0 pathogenic variant. We report two individuals with TCF20 pathogenic variants presenting with unique findings, including thick corpus callosum, family history of mosaicism and cardiac anomalies. These examples expand the TAND phenotype, describe associated dysmorphism in a minority group and highlight the importance of rare disease research.

### Mitral valve prolapse: multimodality imaging and genetic insights [^1118LRiM]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common heritable valvulopathy affecting approximately 2.4% of the population. It is the most important cause of primary mitral regurgitation (MR) requiring surgery. MVP is characterized by fibromyxomatous changes and displacement of one or both mitral leaflets into the left atrium. Echocardiography represents the primary diagnostic modality for assessment of MVP. Accurate quantitation of ventricular volumes and function for surgical planning in asymptomatic severe MR can be provided with both echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance. In addition, assessment of myocardial fibrosis using late gadolinium enhancement and T1 mapping allows better understanding of the impact of MVP on the myocardium. Imaging in MVP is important not only for diagnostic and prognostic purposes, but is also essential for detailed phenotyping in genetic studies. Genotype-phenotype studies in MVP pedigrees have allowed the identification of milder, non-diagnostic MVP morphologies by echocardiography. Such morphologies represent early expression of MVP in gene carriers. This review focuses on multimodality imaging and the phenotypic spectrum of MVP. Moreover, the review details the recent genetic discoveries that have increased our understanding of the pathophysiology of MVP, with clues to mechanisms and therapy.

### Juvenile Huntington disease exacerbated by methylphenidate: case report [^117DzBi4]. Journal of Child Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

The authors describe the case of an 8-year-old boy, otherwise healthy, who presented with symptoms consistent with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and was started on a trial of methylphenidate. Within 4 weeks, he experienced a rapid decline in fine motor skills, with dysarthria, intention tremor, motor impersistence, and diffusely increased tone. Symptoms persisted despite cessation of methylphenidate. At that time, a paternal history of Huntington disease was disclosed. Molecular analysis revealed an expansion in CAG repeats to 75 copies, within the range characteristic of juvenile Huntington disease. This report raises the possibility that use of dopaminergic agonists in patients with a family history of Huntington disease may lead to clinical exacerbation of motor symptoms and/or unwitting diagnosis in an unprepared family.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity deficit (ADHD) — cardiac screening and regulatory compliance in athletes indicates that although groups offer different guidelines, there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine electrocardiogram (ECG) or additional cardiac testing in athletes without cardiac disease on ADHD medications unless combined with other cardiac-impacting drugs such as tricyclic antidepressants. The American Heart Association recommends ECG with nearly all treatments for ADHD, whereas the American Academy of Pediatrics states that there is no need for ECG with stimulant treatment unless there is concern for cardiac disease; if an athlete is at risk by history, family history, and/or physical exam, ECG and additional workup is indicated. There is no evidence to support withholding stimulant treatment due to fear of sudden cardiac death; monitoring for signs and symptoms of cardiac disease is advised, and a very large retrospective cohort study of over 1.2 million children and young adults with 2.5 million person years follow-up, including almost 375 000 person years of current ADHD drug use, did not find increased cardiovascular event risk. Team physicians should be aware of and educate athletes on regulations and requirements; they should use resources from the IOC, NCAA, and World Anti-doping Association (WADA) to determine permissible medications/methods and TUE needs. The NCAA provides a Medical Exception Documentation Reporting Form, and documentation must include DSM-5–based clinical evaluation, blood pressure and heart rate readings and comments, diagnosis, medication(s) and dosage, and confirmation that nonstimulant options have been considered.

Syndromic MVP

Marfan Syndrome

Marfan syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder that affects that affects 1 in 5000 patients. Manifestations of Marfan syndrome are diverse, and tend to affect the ocular, musculoskeletal, and cardiovascular systems. As a result of its pleiotropic presentation, the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome is made using a clinical assessment known as the Ghent criteria, a specific test which scores the likelihood that a patient has Marfan syndrome over other, similar connective tissue disorders. Advances in molecular and genetic testing have further allowed for confirmation of patients who are suspected of having Marfan syndrome and who score positive on the Ghent criteria. As a result, extensive clinical analysis of the phenotypic presentation of genetically confirmed patients with Marfan syndrome exists in the literature. Cardiovascular complications represent the main cause of death in Marfan syndrome, with the majority of fatal events occurring because of aortic pathology including aneurisms, and dissections. In addition, large numbers of patients diagnosed with Marfan have coexistent MVP; our analysis found a median prevalence of 56.7% (range, 21.9%–100%, Figure S1). Indeed, the presence of MVP is considered a minor feature of Marfan syndrome within the most recent Ghent criteria, and is included within the scoring criteria.

### Primary cilia defects causing mitral valve prolapse [^1168bgVb]. Science Translational Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) affects 1 in 40 people and is the most common indication for mitral valve surgery. MVP can cause arrhythmias, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death, and to date, the causes of this disease are poorly understood. We now demonstrate that defects in primary cilia genes and their regulated pathways can cause MVP in familial and sporadic nonsyndromic MVP cases. Our expression studies and genetic ablation experiments confirmed a role for primary cilia in regulating ECM deposition during cardiac development. Loss of primary cilia during development resulted in progressive myxomatous degeneration and profound mitral valve pathology in the adult setting. Analysis of a large family with inherited, autosomal dominant nonsyndromic MVP identified a deleterious missense mutation in a cilia gene, DZIP1 A mouse model harboring this variant confirmed the pathogenicity of this mutation and revealed impaired ciliogenesis during development, which progressed to adult myxomatous valve disease and functional MVP. Relevance of primary cilia in common forms of MVP was tested using pathway enrichment in a large population of patients with MVP and controls from previously generated genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which confirmed the involvement of primary cilia genes in MVP. Together, our studies establish a developmental basis for MVP through altered cilia-dependent regulation of ECM and suggest that defects in primary cilia genes can be causative to disease phenotype in some patients with MVP.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^115BEdBm]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Nonstimulant medications — cardiovascular precautions and adverse effects are as follows: Among nonstimulants, the risk of serious cardiovascular events is extremely low, but atomoxetine, guanfacine, and clonidine may be associated with cardiovascular parameter changes, including increased HR and BP for atomoxetine and decreased HR and BP for guanfacine and clonidine. Clinicians are recommended to not only obtain the personal and family cardiac history but also perform additional evaluation if risk factors are present before starting nonstimulants (for example, perform an electrocardiogram [ECG] and possibly refer to a pediatric cardiologist if the ECG is not normal). Atomoxetine adverse effects include initial somnolence, gastrointestinal tract symptoms if the dosage is increased too rapidly, and decreased appetite; less commonly, an increase in suicidal thoughts has been found and is noted by an FDA black box warning; extremely rarely, hepatitis has been associated. Atomoxetine has been linked to growth delays in the first 1 to 2 years of treatment, with a return to expected measurements after 2 to 3 years of treatment on average, with decreases observed among those who were taller or heavier than average before treatment. For extended-release guanfacine and extended-release clonidine, adverse effects include somnolence, dry mouth, dizziness, irritability, headache, bradycardia, hypotension, and abdominal pain, and because rebound hypertension after abrupt discontinuation has been observed, these medications should be tapered off rather than suddenly discontinued.

### Mitral valve prolapse and its motley crew-syndromic prevalence, pathophysiology, and progression of a common heart condition [^115SaUH5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

The pathophysiology of MVP in patients with EDS is currently not well understood. Most of the genes that are known to cause EDS are associated with the biosynthesis, processing, and turnover of ECM components such as collagen which are important for connective tissue stiffness and strength. It could be hypothesized that less abundant, or less organized collagen causes decreased stiffness and increased flexibility of the connective tissue which results in an increased amount of biomechanical tension within the valve in response to the high pressures exerted on the valve during systolic contraction of the LV. This increase in biomechanical tension may stimulate biomechanical signaling within the valve, activating valve interstitial cells to increase production of glycosaminoglycans and other ECM proteins within the valve; indeed increasing biomechanical forces on valve interstitial cells has been shown to increase the synthesis of ECM proteins. Analytical studies of the mitral valve architecture in patients with EDS would be illuminating to better understand how mutations in collagen genes affect valve structure and function.

Ebstein Anomaly

Ebstein anomaly is a developmental heart defect characterized by inferior displacement of the proximal attachments of the tricuspid valve leaflets from the atrioventricular valve ring, resulting in an "atrialized" portion of the right ventricle. Ebstein anomaly occurs in ≈1 in 14 000 live births, and has been associated with other cardiovascular defects, including MVP. In studies included in this review, we found the median prevalence of MVP was 11.4% in patients who were born with Ebstein anomaly (Figure S1). The precise mechanism of MVP development in Ebstein anomaly is not known, but that is unsurprising since the precise cause of Ebstein anomaly is also not known. Lithium, a mood stabilizer used to treat bipolar disorder, was originally thought to be a major causative factor in Ebstein anomaly, and was thought to affect cardiovascular development during the first trimester, although more recent studies dispute this finding. In addition, family studies have shown several genes that are associated with Ebstein anomaly. The future will hopefully shed light on the precise mechanism of development of Ebstein anomaly.

Familial Myxomatous Valvular Degeneration

Familial myxomatous valvular degeneration, also called familial cardiac valvular dystrophy, is a heterogeneously defined group of disorders characterized by myxomatous degeneration in multiple heart valves. The median prevalence of MVP in patients with familial myxomatous valvular degeneration is 38.1% in studies that our analysis identified (Figure S1). Mutations in the Xq28 gene encoding filamin A has been found to cause familial myxomatous valvular degeneration. In animal studies, knockout of Filamin A was demonstrated to cause enlargement of the mitral valve in the fetal period that progressed to MVP by 2 months of age. Further, filamin A mutations were found to disrupt the interactions between filamin A and PTPN12, a tyrosine phosphatase that is a key regulator of cell‐ECM crosstalk, in a yeast 2‐hybrid screen. Loss of this interaction appears to disrupt integrin‐mediated adhesion and endothelial cell migration in the developing mitral valve, leading to a structurally weak mitral valve. Further, mechanical stress on the mitral valve has been shown to affect the affinity of filamin A to its binding partners, though no study has specifically looked at the filamin A‐PTPN12 interaction in the context of mechanical stress. One recent study also highlights a potential interaction between components of the serotonergic signaling cascade. This may be relevant in light of carcinoid mitral valves, which stem from hyperstimulation of serotonin system on valve endothelial cells. Taken together, filamin A disrupts cell behaviors during heart development, and provides a developmental substrate for hemodynamically induced myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve.

### Arrhythmogenic mitral valve prolapse revisited: a not uncommon cause of youthful sudden death in athletes and women [^116AmgSR]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sudden deaths (SDs) in young people, including competitive athletes, albeit uncommon, are usually attributable to genetic, congenital or acquired cardiovascular conditions. However, it is under-appreciated that mitral valve prolapse (MVP), a relatively common valvular heart disease, is associated with SD in this youthful population.

Methods

Forty-three MVP-related SDs were identified from 2 large cardiovascular registries with pathologic, clinical, and demographic findings reported.

Results

Events occurred in both sexes, but females were unexpectedly common (49%); median age was 22 ± 8 years, and 29 (67%) were engaged in competitive sports, including 17 with preparticipation examination. Of the 43 MVP cases, 21 died suddenly during or just after vigorous exercise, including 6 during organized sports. Sixteen (37%) had been evaluated by a cardiologist, resulting in confirmed MVP diagnosis in 11. Pathologic findings characteristic of MVP included bileaflet myxomatous involvement (in all cases) and areas of interstitial or replacement myocardial fibrosis (in 79%), most evident in posterolateral left ventricular wall.

Conclusions

Arrhythmogenic myxomatous degeneration (MVP) is an under-recognized cause of SD in young people, including competitive athletes, disproportionally affecting females and requires a high index of clinical suspicion. Frequency of left ventricular fibrosis in these young people with MVP suggests a mechanism for ventricular tachyarrhythmias and SD, relevant to future risk stratification.

### Mitral valve prolapse and its motley crew-syndromic prevalence, pathophysiology, and progression of a common heart condition [^115XfVuA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Mitral valve prolapse is a common heart condition that is estimated to affect 2% to 3% of individuals. The defining finding in mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve leaflets, which eventually leads to structural incompetence and superior displacement of one or both mitral leaflets into the left atrium (LA) during systole. Though it is recognized as a highly prevalent heart condition, the question of whether it is benign has been hotly disputed over the years. After initially being described as a risk factor for several diseases including heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stroke, mitral regurgitation, and others, an analysis of the Framingham Heart Study offspring cohort in 1999 disputed these findings, arguing that many of these associations were made in hospital‐based cohorts, and therefore patients were sicker and more likely to have comorbid disease. Subsequently, a community study of asymptomatic patients with mitral valve prolapse disputed these findings, and reported that the clinical course was much more heterogeneous than described in the Framingham study.

Despite the controversy, it is now well recognized that mitral valve prolapse poses a significant disease burden and is a major contributor to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Based on the prevalence estimates at 2% to 3%, it is hypothesized that > 7.8 million people in the United States, and > 176 million people worldwide, are living with MVP. Another study published in 2020 estimates that prevalence worldwide of degenerative mitral valve disease, defined as myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve leading to hemodynamically moderate or severe mitral regurgitation, is 18.1 million people (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 17.6 million to 18.6 million) and that the mortality rate from degenerative mitral valve disease in 2017 was 35 700 people (95% UI, 30 500–42 500). The discrepancy in prevalent cases between these 2 studies is likely attributable to a more stringent definition of degenerative mitral valve disease, which excludes patients with myxomatous degeneration who have mild or absent regurgitation. Further, it is unclear from the published data whether the mortality associated with degenerative mitral valve disease is a direct result of the valvular dysfunction itself, or as a result of recognized nonvalvular complications of mitral valve disease. Greater than 90 000 mitral valve surgeries occur each year making it the fastest growing cardiovascular intervention in the United States. Further, no Food and Drug Administration approved medical treatments exist for MVP, meaning surgical or percutaneous correction is the only treatment available to patients.

Vasovagal syncope — natural history and treatment framing — is generally benign with clusters of syncopes interspersed with long quiescent periods without recurrences; younger and older individuals differ markedly, with the latter group more likely to have complicating comorbidities and medical therapies; despite the apparently benign profile, patients with frequent episodes occasionally need treatment, and when considering therapy it is important to weigh the natural history, potential for harm, and the marked reduction in syncope seen in all control arms of randomized trials against symptom severity and overall likelihood of treatment efficacy.

ADPKD — Cardiac associations and echocardiography: Echocardiography at baseline with occasional repeat echocardiograms should be offered in people with ADPKD who have a history of severe or uncontrolled hypertension, a heart murmur, signs or symptoms of cardiac dysfunction, other cardiovascular manifestations, or a family history of thoracic aortic disease. Echocardiography remains the preferred method to detect left ventricular hypertrophy, and valvular abnormalities can be detected by echocardiography. Mitral valve prolapse formerly was reported to be present in 20%–30% of the people with ADPKD, but more recent studies using the current definition of mitral valve prolapse (MVP) reported a prevalence of 1% in pediatric and 3.4% in adult cohorts, similar to those in the general population. Some studies suggest that primary cardiomyopathies and atrial fibrillation may be more common among people with ADPKD; however, the rarity of these cardiomyopathies and the limited evidence for this association does not support systematic screening in all people with ADPKD. In case of a positive familial history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy, presymptomatic echocardiography should be performed, and presymptomatic echocardiography should be performed in people with a family history of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA).

Stimulant withdrawal — Abrupt discontinuation or reduction in stimulant use can cause stimulant withdrawal syndrome, and many patients will experience 12 to 24 hours of somnolence and irritability — likely due to catecholamine depletion and sleep deprivation. During periods of abrupt stimulant reduction or discontinuation, clinicians should be attentive to the patient's physical and mental health signs and symptoms. The current standard of care for managing stimulant withdrawal focuses on ameliorating presenting signs and symptoms and minimizing risks. Behavioral and environmental interventions should be used to foster a calming environment.

Tricuspid regurgitation — primary leaflet pathology and trauma-related causes note that because the tricuspid valve is nonplanar, the term "TV prolapse" is typically reserved for excessive billowing into the right atrium associated with redundancy of the tricuspid leaflets and this abnormality is seen in 20% of patients with concomitant mitral valve prolapse. Flail tricuspid leaflets are not typically associated with myxomatous tricuspid valve disease but rather with closed chest trauma or right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy.

### Floppy mitral valve / mitral valve prolapse and sudden cardiac death [^1128XHCq]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

It is well appreciated today that sudden cardiac death (SCD) occurs in patients with floppy mitral valve (FMV)/mitral valve prolapse (MVP) without significant mitral regurgitation. Data from studies most likely represent a heterogeneous population and probably underestimate the true incidence of SCD in this group of patients. SCD in patients with FMV/MVP occurs mostly in young individuals without comorbidities. Over the last decade, the phenotypic expression of patients with FMV/MVP at risk for SCD (bileaflet prolapse, redundant mitral leaflets, symptomatic young women) have been defined, possible pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to SCD have been proposed, and appropriate steps to prevent the catastrophic event, though in evolution, have been suggested. In this review, state-of-the-art knowledge related to SCD in patients with FMV/MVP is summarized.

### Mitral valve prolapse and sudden cardiac arrest in the community [^115RwYcK]. Heart Rhythm (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is relatively common in the general population with recently reported prevalence of 1% and familial clustering (Framingham Heart Study). However, its association with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) remains controversial.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to characterize the frequency and clinical profile of patients with MVP who suffer SCA in the community.

Methods

Patients with SCA cases were prospectively identified in the population-based Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study (population ~1 million). The presence of MVP was identified from echocardiograms recorded prior but unrelated to the SCA event. The detailed clinical profile of patients with SCA and MVP was compared with that of SCA patients without MVP to identify potential differences.

Results

A total of 729 SCA patients were evaluated over a 12-year period (mean age 69.5 ± 14.8 years; 64.6% men). MVP was observed in 17 (2.3%) prior to the SCA event (95% confidence interval 1.2%-3.4%). Mitral regurgitation was present in 14 SCA patients with MVP (82.3%) and was moderate or severe in 10 (58.8%). Compared with SCA patients without MVP, SCA patients with MVP were younger (mean age 60.9 ± 16.4 years vs 69.7 ± 14.7 years; P = 0.02), with fewer risk factors (diabetes 5.9% vs 46.4%; P = 0.001; hypertension 41.2% vs 78.9%; P = 0.001) or known coronary disease (29.4% vs 65.6%; P < .001).

Conclusion

MVP was observed in a small proportion (2.3%) of SCA patients in the general population, suggesting a low risk overall. Since SCA patients with MVP were characterized by younger age and relatively low cardiovascular comorbidity, a focus on imaging for valve structure/insufficiency as well as genetics could aid future risk stratification approaches.

Wide complex tachycardia is defined as a cardiac rhythm with a rate greater than 100 beats/min (bpm) and a QRS complex duration greater than 0.10 to 0.12seconds (s) in the adult patient; wide complex tachycardia (WCT) in children is defined according to age-related metrics. The differential diagnosis of the WCT includes ventricular tachycardia and supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant intraventricular conduction, including both relatively benign and life-threatening dysrhythmias. This review focuses on the differential diagnosis of WCT with a discussion of strategies useful in making the appropriate diagnosis, when possible.

### Mitral valve prolapse and its motley crew-syndromic prevalence, pathophysiology, and progression of a common heart condition [^112iLEpZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our review of the literature found that while MVP is enriched in several genetic and syndromic disorders, many disease associations that have previously been reported either do not have enough data available to assess the true prevalence of disease, or were reported before the adaptation of new clinical diagnostic guidelines for MVP that took the saddle shape of the mitral valve annulus into account. As such, diseases such as osteogenesis imperfecta, fragile X syndrome, Down syndrome, and Pseudoxanthoma elasticum, which have all been previously associated with MVP, may be over‐reporting the prevalence of MVP. Finally, MVP may be a phenotype present in other genetic syndromes not discussed within this paper, but that have not been well documented in the literature. Additional studies, which use up‐to‐date diagnostic criteria for MVP, will be important to assess whether MVP is truly associated with these conditions.

Our review further demonstrates the shared pathways through which MVP can develop in a heterogeneous group of conditions. First, the vast majority of mutations that have been identified that cause syndromic and nonsyndromic MVP cause alterations in valve geometry through either increases in ECM production, impaired ECM remodeling, or altered cell migration and valve morphogenesis. Second, the new, novel role for primary cilia as a master regulator of valve morphogenesis and major cause of MVP has shed new light on how disruptions in early cardiac valve development may "prime" patients to develop worsening MVP by altering their valve architecture early on in their lifetime. Finally, the role of TGF‐β dependent cell signaling highlights the importance of cell signaling, proliferation, and activation in driving MVP pathophysiology. Taken together, we propose a model in which changes in valve geometry, and subsequent alterations in valvular dynamics during the cardiac cycle, create a feed forward cycle that, through altered cell signaling, interstitial cell activation, and ECM production and remodeling, drives myxomatous degeneration and the development of MVP. A prolapsing valve then drives the further development of cardiovascular disorders through changes in biomechanics and hemodynamics (Figure).

### Mitral valve prolapse and its motley crew-syndromic prevalence, pathophysiology, and progression of a common heart condition [^116gnRQK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

When mitral regurgitation becomes heart failure is also heterogeneously defined in the literature. For the purposes of discussion here, and based on our interpretation of the guidelines, the development of heart failure in a patient with mitral regurgitation would hinge on the development of the clinical symptoms of heart failure (eg, dyspnea, exercise intolerance), which is denoted "Severe symptomatic mitral regurgitation" by the 2014 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines on the management of patients with valvular heart disease executive summary. Indeed, many studies that describe the outcomes of patients with severe mitral regurgitation describe the severity of symptoms using the New York Heart Association functional criteria for heart failure. This of course makes it difficult to delineate the 2 disorders from one another.

Because heart failure is defined in many ways, and as a result of the inter‐relatedness of heart failure and mitral regurgitation, it is difficult to estimate the risk of developing heart failure in patients with MVP; nonetheless studies have tried to do so. In the Olmstead study of 833 patients with asymptomatic MVP, 5.7% developed heart failure that was determined to be a result of their disease. In the same study, however, 66 patients had mitral valve surgery, which may demonstrate additional patients who initially developed symptoms of heart failure, but who met criteria for surgery. In another cohort of patients with mitral regurgitation that that met criteria for valve surgery, a third of patients went on to develop heart failure within 10 years, but in the same cohort, 370 out of 576 patients, or nearly 2 in 3 patients, had a diagnosis of heart failure before their surgery, presumably because of the presence of symptoms of heart failure. In an editorial in 2018, Gillam et al further highlighted the problems with using presence of symptoms as a tool for diagnosis of symptomatic mitral regurgitation/heart failure. They argue that it can be difficult to differentiate the patient with severe regurgitation who is "at risk" for heart failure (meaning in New York Heart Association class 1, but without symptoms) from someone who meets criteria for a diagnosis of heart failure because patients with mild exercise intolerance will subconsciously curtail the amount of physical activity they engage in. In a nationwide hospital‐based registry study, Andell et al found that 39.3% of patients with a diagnosis of mitral regurgitation had a coexistent diagnosis of heart failure, yet they also point out that this is a 2‐way street; primary MR reduces effective stroke volume and causes heart failure, but mitral regurgitation can also result from annular dilation secondary to left ventricular dilation in heart failure or ischemic heart disease. For the purposes of this review, we focused primarily on the mechanisms through which primary regurgitation can cause worsening left and right heart function, and eventually cause heart failure.

### Attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: management [^114GHJ8p]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common psychiatric disorder of childhood and often persists into adulthood. ADHD is a neurophysiologic disorder defined in behavioral terms and associated with significant morbidity in the realms of social and academic success, and self-esteem. ADHD is often associated with comorbid psychiatric disorders and learning disabilities, which further impede the successful development of these persons. It is essential that family physicians be knowledgeable about the presentation and diagnosis of ADHD. Stimulant medications continue to be the mainstay of treatment, although many other medications (such as antidepressants and alpha blockers) are helpful adjuvants to therapy. Current recommendations for treatment include an individualized, multimodal approach involving parents, teachers, counselors and the school system. Treatment follow-up includes monitoring response to medications in various settings, as well as side effects. With time and interest, the family physician can develop the skills needed to treat this disorder.

### Mitral valve disease – morphology and mechanisms [^116HKCGy]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Mitral valve disease is a frequent cause of heart failure and death. Emerging evidence indicates that the mitral valve is not a passive structure, but — even in adult life — remains dynamic and accessible for treatment. This concept motivates efforts to reduce the clinical progression of mitral valve disease through early detection and modification of underlying mechanisms. Discoveries of genetic mutations causing mitral valve elongation and prolapse have revealed that growth factor signalling and cell migration pathways are regulated by structural molecules in ways that can be modified to limit progression from developmental defects to valve degeneration with clinical complications. Mitral valve enlargement can determine left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and might be stimulated by potentially modifiable biological valvular-ventricular interactions. Mitral valve plasticity also allows adaptive growth in response to ventricular remodelling. However, adverse cellular and mechanobiological processes create relative leaflet deficiency in the ischaemic setting, leading to mitral regurgitation with increased heart failure and mortality. Our approach, which bridges clinicians and basic scientists, enables the correlation of observed disease with cellular and molecular mechanisms, leading to the discovery of new opportunities for improving the natural history of mitral valve disease.

### Mitral valve prolapse and its motley crew-syndromic prevalence, pathophysiology, and progression of a common heart condition [^116x9AgT]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

The purpose of this review was to summarize and analyze the current understanding of comorbid conditions with MVP. MVP has been identified as a component of many genetic syndromes, and genome‐wide association studies have identified primary loci thought to be important for MVP pathogenesis. Further, both cardiac and non‐cardiac diseases have been associated with MVP. An important consideration is that most, if not all, of the publications cited in this manuscript use Barlow disease and MVP interchangeably. There is an important distinction between these 2 types of mitral valve disease. Barlow disease is characterized by pronounced annuluar dilatation, bileaflet prolapse and/or billowing, hooding, and the presence of thick, spongy leaflets because of excessive myxomatous tissue proliferation with or without calcification. The terminology of Barlow does not apply to all cases of MVP, especially in terms of single leaflet prolapse. As these distinctions are generally not well documented in the literature, we will use the more encompassing term of MVP. The following review will focus on analyzing the shared pathophysiology between MVP and other diseases, and the unique pathways that exist in MVP.

### New locus for autosomal dominant mitral valve prolapse on chromosome 13: clinical insights from genetic studies [^112B6r8n]. Circulation (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common disorder associated with mitral regurgitation, endocarditis, heart failure, and sudden death. To date, 2 MVP loci have been described, but the defective genes have yet to be discovered. In the present study, we analyzed a large family segregating MVP, and identified a new locus, MMVP3. This study and others have enabled us to explore mitral valve morphological variations of currently uncertain clinical significance.

Methods and Results

Echocardiograms and blood samples were obtained from 43 individuals who were classified by the extent and pattern of displacement. Genotypic analyses were performed with polymorphic microsatellite markers. Evidence of linkage was obtained on chromosome 13q31.3-q32.1, with a peak nonparametric linkage score of 18.41 (P < 0.0007). Multipoint parametric analysis gave a logarithm of odds score of 3.17 at marker D13S132. Of the 6 related individuals with mitral valve morphologies not meeting diagnostic criteria but resembling fully developed forms, 5 carried all or part of the haplotype linked to MVP.

Conclusions

The mapping of a new MVP locus to chromosome 13 confirms the observed genetic heterogeneity and represents an important step toward gene identification. Furthermore, the genetic analysis provides clinical lessons with regard to previously nondiagnostic morphologies. In the familial context, these may represent early expression in gene carriers. Early recognition of gene carriers could potentially enhance the clinical evaluation of patients at risk of full expression, with the ultimate aim of developing interventions to reduce progression.

### Mitral valve prolapse and its motley crew-syndromic prevalence, pathophysiology, and progression of a common heart condition [^115U23ad]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

In a second study comprised of 833 asymptomatic patients with MVP defined by echocardiography at baseline, the presence of comorbidities was analyzed longitudinally. In this cohort, 7.6% were determined to have an MVP‐related event, defined as death, heart failure related to MVP, endocarditis, or mitral surgery in 10 years of follow‐up. Further, severity of mitral regurgitation at baseline was the strongest risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity. In the Strong Heart Study, patients with MVP had a significantly higher prevalence of both mild mitral regurgitation (28.1% versus 18.9%) and moderate‐to‐severe mitral regurgitation (8.8% versus 2.1%) compared with patients without MVP. Whilst the above studies make it clear that MVP is not as benign of a disease as was originally thought, more work needs to be done to understand why some patients have a more severe disease course, while others do not.

MVP is the most common cause of severe mitral regurgitation requiring surgery. By one estimate, ≈0.2% to 3.5% of patients with prolapse will require surgery for their condition at some point in their lifetime, depending on their demographics. Mitral valve surgery, carries significant risks, but is highly effective at preventing mortality in patients with severe regurgitation. Moreover, less invasive percutaneous catheter‐based procedures have been developed, are available for patients who are not ideal candidates for surgery, and have been shown to improve quality of life, reduce rehospitalizations, and promote favorable ventricular remodeling, although they were not shown to improve survival at 1 year.

### Imaging for the assessment of the arrhythmogenic potential of mitral valve prolapse [^115VqYfZ]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is the most common valve disease in the western world and recently emerged as a possible substrate for sudden cardiac death (SCD). It is estimated an annual risk of sudden cardiac death of 0.2 to 1.9% mostly caused by complex ventricular arrhythmias (VA). Several mechanisms have been recognized as potentially responsible for arrhythmia onset in MVP, resulting from the combination of morpho-functional abnormality of the mitral valve, structural substrates (regional myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, Purkinje fibers activity, inflammation), and mechanical stretch. Echocardiography plays a central role in MVP diagnosis and assessment of severity of regurgitation. Several abnormalities detectable by echocardiography can be prognostic for the occurrence of VA, from morphological alteration including leaflet redundancy and thickness, mitral annular dilatation, and mitral annulus disjunction (MAD), to motion abnormalities detectable with "Pickelhaube" sign. Additionally, speckle-tracking echocardiography may identify MVP patients at higher risk for VA by detection of increased mechanical dispersion. On the other hand, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) has the capability to provide a comprehensive risk stratification combining the identification of morphological and motion alteration with the detection of myocardial replacement and interstitial fibrosis, making CMR an ideal method for arrhythmia risk stratification in patients with MVP. Finally, recent studies have suggested a potential role in risk stratification of new techniques such as hybrid PET-MR and late contrast enhancement CT. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the mitral valve prolapse syndrome with a focus on the role of imaging in arrhythmic risk stratification. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Mitral valve prolapse is the most frequent valve condition potentially associated with arrhythmias. Imaging has a central role in the identification of anatomical, functional, mechanical, and structural alterations potentially associated with a higher risk of developing complex ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. KEY POINTS:
- Mitral valve prolapse is a common valve disease potentially associated with complex ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death.
- The mechanism of arrhythmogenesis in mitral valve prolapse is complex and multifactorial, due to the interplay among multiple conditions including valve morphological alteration, mechanical stretch, myocardial structure remodeling with fibrosis, and inflammation.
- Cardiac imaging, especially echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance, is crucial in the identification of several features associated with the potential risk of serious cardiac events. In particular, cardiac magnetic resonance has the advantage of being able to detect myocardial fibrosis which is currently the strongest prognosticator.
