## Question

When is an interval imaging of stage 3b ovarian cancer be done after debulking surgery and 5 out of 15 sessions of chemotherapy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when interval imaging should be performed for stage IIIB ovarian cancer after debulking surgery and 5 out of 15 planned chemotherapy sessions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the patient had primary debulking surgery or interval debulking after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Then, I should verify the standard total number of cycles and where 5 cycles fits in that framework. Next, I will review guideline-based recommendations for imaging during treatment and at completion. After that, I need to check whether any high-quality sources mandate a specific mid-chemotherapy scan at cycle 5. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, evidence-aligned recommendation and note any exceptions where earlier imaging is warranted.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. The phrase "after debulking surgery and 5 out of 15 sessions of chemotherapy" most plausibly reflects a scenario where the patient underwent primary debulking surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy totaling 6 cycles, with 5 cycles already administered, implying 1 cycle remaining. Alternatively, it could reflect a neoadjuvant approach with more total cycles, but the most common adjuvant total is 6, so 5 of 6 is the most straightforward interpretation, and I should proceed with that assumption while noting the alternative pathway if NACT was used [^41d8edcb] [^fd6b5f17].

> Wait, let me verify the standard treatment framework. For advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, including stage IIIB, the typical first-line plan is primary debulking surgery aiming for optimal cytoreduction, followed by 6 cycles of platinum–taxane chemotherapy; in selected patients with unresectable disease or high surgical risk, neoadjuvant chemotherapy with 3–4 cycles, then interval debulking, then 3–4 additional cycles is standard, totaling 6–8 cycles, which anchors how we interpret "5 out of 15" as likely 5 of 6 adjuvant cycles rather than 5 of 15 total in a NACT regimen [^41d8edcb] [^fd6b5f17].

> I need to check whether any major guideline mandates routine interval imaging at cycle 5. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. NCCN guidance emphasizes that during and after primary treatment, imaging is performed as clinically indicated to assess response or residual disease, and it does not specify a routine mid-chemotherapy scan at cycle 5; similarly, ESMO and ASCO/SGO documents focus on clinical assessment and CA-125 trends during treatment, reserving imaging for symptoms, rising markers, or suspected progression rather than scheduled mid-chemo scans [^27874005] [^971f30d2] [^8bd958bb].

> Let me consider the practical timing. Routine interval imaging is not recommended at cycle 5 in asymptomatic patients with stable clinical findings and nonrising CA-125. Instead, response assessment is generally clinical, with imaging reserved for new symptoms, concerning exam findings, or biochemical progression, and a baseline postoperative scan is often obtained before starting chemotherapy to document residual disease, after which imaging is driven by clinical triggers rather than a fixed mid-chemo schedule [^27874005] [^d538f64b] [^b0ebe25d].

> But wait, what if the original plan truly entails 15 total cycles, implying a neoadjuvant strategy with prolonged preoperative therapy? I should double-check that nuance. Even in NACT pathways, IDS is typically performed after 3–4 cycles, and extending beyond 6 total cycles is uncommon outside trials or special circumstances; moreover, contemporary data do not show superiority of delaying IDS beyond 3–4 cycles, and some observational data suggest worse outcomes with prolonged delays, so a mid-chemo scan at cycle 5 would still not be standard unless it informs surgical timing or suspected progression [^fd6b5f17] [^8ca603de] [^0e888e7e].

> I will now examine exceptions where earlier imaging is appropriate. If the patient develops new symptoms such as pain, bloating, bowel obstruction, or dyspnea, or if CA-125 rises significantly from nadir, or if the physical examination reveals new masses, then contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (or MRI/PET-CT as appropriate) should be obtained promptly to evaluate for progression or new disease, regardless of cycle number, because this changes management decisions and may prompt earlier surgical or systemic adjustments [^27874005] [^d538f64b].

> Next, I should review what to do at the end of chemotherapy. After completion of the planned 6 cycles, it is reasonable to obtain baseline surveillance imaging to document disease status, even if the patient is asymptomatic, to establish a new baseline for follow-up; thereafter, surveillance should be clinical every 3–6 months with CA-125 and exam, reserving imaging for symptoms, rising markers, or suspicious findings, consistent with NCCN and ESMO guidance [^27874005] [^d538f64b].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Interval imaging at cycle 5 is not routinely indicated in an asymptomatic patient with stable clinical and laboratory findings. Imaging should be symptom- or marker-driven during treatment, with a post-completion baseline scan considered after 6 cycles, and any earlier imaging justified by clinical changes or suspected progression, which aligns with high-quality guideline recommendations and avoids unnecessary radiation and cost without altering outcomes [^27874005] [^d538f64b] [^971f30d2].

Routine interval imaging is **not recommended** after debulking surgery and 5 cycles of chemotherapy for stage IIIB ovarian cancer unless there are new symptoms, rising CA-125, or clinical suspicion of progression [^27874005] [^d538f64b]. Standard practice is to assess response clinically and with CA-125; reserve imaging for **clinical indications** or at the completion of chemotherapy [^27874005]. If imaging is needed, contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is preferred [^255fc1fb]; MRI or PET/CT can be used if CT is contraindicated or inconclusive [^27874005]. Early imaging at cycle 5 is only justified if there is clinical suspicion of progression or to guide management decisions [^d538f64b].

---

## Standard imaging protocols during chemotherapy

- **Clinical assessment and CA-125 monitoring**: Regular clinical evaluations and CA-125 measurements are standard during chemotherapy to monitor response and detect recurrence [^971f30d2].

- **Imaging reserved for clinical indications**: Imaging is typically reserved for patients who develop new symptoms, have rising CA-125 levels, or when clinical examination suggests disease progression or recurrence [^27874005] [^d538f64b].

- **Completion of chemotherapy imaging**: Imaging is commonly performed upon completion of chemotherapy to establish a baseline for future surveillance and to document response to treatment [^notfound].

---

## Circumstances warranting interval imaging at cycle 5

While routine imaging at cycle 5 is not standard, certain clinical scenarios may justify early imaging:

- **Rising CA-125 levels**: If CA-125 levels rise significantly during treatment, imaging may be warranted to assess for disease progression [^notfound].

- **New or worsening symptoms**: Symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, or new masses may prompt imaging to evaluate for recurrence or progression [^27874005].

- **Clinical suspicion of progression**: If physical examination or clinical judgment suggests disease progression, imaging may be indicated [^d538f64b].

---

## Recommended imaging modalities

When imaging is indicated, the following modalities are recommended:

| **Imaging modality** | **Indications** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) | - First-line imaging for suspected recurrence or progression <br/> - Widely available | - Good sensitivity and specificity for detecting macroscopic disease <br/> - Widely available | - Radiation exposure <br/> - Contrast allergy |
| MRI | - Alternative when CT is contraindicated (e.g. contrast allergy, renal impairment) <br/> - Better soft tissue contrast | - No radiation exposure <br/> - Superior soft tissue contrast | - Limited availability <br/> - Longer scan time |
| PET/CT | - Suspected recurrence with inconclusive CT/MRI <br/> - Evaluation of metabolic activity | - High sensitivity for metabolic activity <br/> - Useful for detecting occult disease | - Limited availability <br/> - False positives/negatives |

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

Current clinical guidelines emphasize **individualized imaging decisions** based on clinical judgment, patient symptoms, and biochemical markers [^27874005] [^d538f64b]. Routine interval imaging at cycle 5 is not supported by evidence or guidelines unless there is clinical suspicion of progression or recurrence [^27874005].

---

## Potential risks and benefits of early interval imaging

### Benefits

Potential benefits include **early detection** of recurrence or progression, enabling timely intervention, and **reassurance** for patients and clinicians when results are negative.

---

### Risks

Potential risks include **false positives** leading to unnecessary anxiety, interventions, and costs; **false negatives** providing false reassurance and delaying necessary treatment; and **radiation exposure** with repeated CT scans.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Routine interval imaging after debulking surgery and 5 cycles of chemotherapy for stage IIIB ovarian cancer is **not recommended** unless there are clinical indications such as rising CA-125, new symptoms, or clinical suspicion of progression [^27874005]. Imaging should be reserved for clinical indications or at the completion of chemotherapy, with contrast-enhanced CT as the preferred modality [^27874005].

Background

Interval debulking surgery (IDS), following induction or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, may have a role in treating advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (stage III to IV) where primary debulking surgery is not an option.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and complications of IDS for women with advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2012, Issue 6, MEDLINE and EMBASE for the original review in to June 2012. We updated the searches in June 2009, 2012 and 2015 for the review updates.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing survival of women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, who had IDS performed between cycles of chemotherapy after primary surgery with survival of women who had conventional treatment (primary debulking surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Searches for additional information from study authors were attempted. We performed meta-analysis of overall and progression-free survival (PFS), using random-effects models.

Main Results

Three RCTs randomising 853 women, of whom 781 were evaluated, met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of three trials for overall survival (OS) found no statistically significant difference between IDS and chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.06, I² = 58%). Subgroup analysis for OS in two trials, where the primary surgery was not performed by gynaecologic oncologists or was less extensive, showed a benefit of IDS (HR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.87, I² = 0%). Meta-analysis of two trials for PFS found no statistically significant difference between IDS and chemotherapy alone (HR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.33, I² = 83%). Rates of toxic reactions to chemotherapy were similar in both arms (risk ratio = 1.19, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.66, I² = 0%), but little information was available for other adverse events or quality or life (QoL).

Authors' Conclusions

We found no conclusive evidence to determine whether IDS between cycles of chemotherapy would improve or decrease the survival rates of women with advanced ovarian cancer, compared with conventional treatment of primary surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. IDS appeared to yield benefit only in women whose primary surgery was not performed by gynaecologic oncologists or was less extensive. Data on QoL and adverse events were inconclusive.

### Interval debulking surgery for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer [^15fdf3f9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Primary debulking surgery, a crucial step in the management of epithelial ovarian cancer, is not always an option in patients with advanced stage disease (stage III to IV). In some circumstances, surgery may not yield satisfactory results with residual tumour masses > 1 to 2 cm (so called suboptimal surgery). Induction or neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery (IDS) may have an alternative role in this setting. However, the advantage of IDS compared to conventional methods is still a controversial issue.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and complications of IDS for patients with advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2008), MEDLINE (January 1966 to June 2008), EMBASE (January 1966 to June 2008), and reference lists of included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing survival of women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, who had IDS performed between cycles of chemotherapy after primary surgery with survival of women who had conventional treatment (primary debulking surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Searches for additional information from study authors were attempted. Meta-analysis of overall and progression free survival (PFS) was performed using fixed effects models.

Main Results

Three RCTs, randomising 853 women of whom 781 were evaluated, met the inclusion criteria. Overall survival (OS) showed substantial heterogeneity between trials (I² = 58%). Subgroup analysis for overall survival in two trials, wherein the primary surgery was not performed by gynecologic oncologists or was less extensive, showed a benefit of IDS: (relative risk) RR = 0.7 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.5 to 0.9, I² = 0%). Likewise, substantial heterogeneity between two trials for PFS evaluating 702 women was also shown (I² = 75%). Rates of toxic reactions to chemotherapy were similar in both arms (RR = 1.3, 95%CI: 0.4 to 3.6), but little information is available for other adverse events. Only one trial reported quality of life (QOL), which was generally similar in both treatment arms.

Authors' Conclusions

No conclusive evidence was found to determine whether IDS between cycles of chemotherapy would improve or decrease the survival rates of women with advanced ovarian cancer, compared with conventional treatment of primary surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. IDS appeared to yield benefit only in the patients whose primary surgery was not performed by gynecologic oncologists or was less extensive. Data on QOL and adverse events were inconclusive.

### How to select neoadjuvant chemotherapy or primary debulking surgery in patients with stage IIIC or IV ovarian carcinoma… [^6499e9aa]. ASCO (2016). Low credibility.

Accompanying ArticleFree accessORIGINAL REPORTSUse and Effectiveness of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Treatment of Ovarian Cancer Our experience with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery began 25 years ago. 1and later resulted in the first randomized trial that compared NACT plus IDS with primary debulking surgery followed by postoperative chemotherapy. 2This randomized study showed similar overall survival and progression-free survival in both treatment strategies for patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIIC or IV ovarian cancer, with a lower operative morbidity with NACT. These results were later confirmed in the randomized CHORUS trial. 3Despite numerous analyses and debates, optimal treatment strategy for each patient remains controversial.

In a subgroup of propensity scored, matched cohorts, overall survival was shorter for patients with stage IIIC disease who were treated with NACT, but not for those with stage IV disease compared with PDS. The authors performed sensitivity analyses to compensate for higher disease burden, less intraperitoneal chemotherapy, and to exclude patients who did not undergo IDS after NACT, and improved overall survival with PDS was confirmed in patients with stage IIIC disease. Hence, the group of patients with smaller stage IIIC disease was probably smaller than in the retrospective study by Meyer et al, 4which included all patients with stage IIIC. Furthermore, Meyer et al underscore that patients who achieved a microscopic or ≤ 1-cm postoperative residual disease after treatment with NACT have decreased overall survival compared with PDS.

However, this is not surprising because in the two randomized trials 2, 3it was also shown that after NACT, more patients can undergo cytoreduction to R0 than at PDS, as NACT makes it easier to debulk to R0. Hence, more patients with unfavorable prognostic characteristics undergo cytoreduction to R0 at IDS than at PDS. In addition, we showed that patients who underwent cytoreduction to 1 mm to 10 mm residual tumor at IDS did not have improved survival compared with those with > 1 cm residual tumor, whereas patients with an R0 resection at IDS did have improved survival. 2 These observations have led us to recommend treatment with PDS in all patients with stage IIIC disease who can achieve an R0 resection with an acceptable morbidity as well as to recommend treatment with NACT in most patients with stage IV disease.

Staging and neoadjuvant therapy for suspected stage III/IV ovarian cancer — patients are first evaluated for surgical management taking into account tumor burden, functional status assessment (FSA), and comorbidity, and clinicians counsel patients on treatment options with referral to a cancer treatment center with specialized surgical services; if unable to travel to a distant health center, refer to palliative care recommendations, and when surgery is pursued the goal is complete tumor cytoreduction to no gross residual disease/remove all macroscopic visible disease; patients with biopsy-proven International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IIIC or IV (specifically high tumor load/stage IVB), expectedly high morbidity surgery, poor performance status (PS), or unresectable disease receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) with interval debulking or referral to a higher-level cancer center, after which those with progressive disease on NACT have little role for surgery unless for palliation, whereas those with a response to chemotherapy or stable disease undergo interval cytoreductive surgery after ≤ 4 cycles of NACT.

### Assessment of adult women with ovarian masses and treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline [^500f1826]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) — interval cytoreductive surgery indications and resource-stratified guidance specify that patients with stage III/IV disease with bulky disease may benefit from NACT if a gynecologic oncologist or surgical oncologist reviews the case and deems the patient's disease as unresectable or unlikely to achieve complete cytoreduction, and additional patients appropriate for NACT include those with poor PS or at high surgical risk assessed by a surgical specialist; according to the ASCO and SGO guideline on NACT in stage IIIC and IV only, patients with response to chemotherapy or stable disease following three to four cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy benefit from interval cytoreductive surgery, with the goal to achieve optimal tumor cytoreduction to < 1 cm, ideally to no visible disease (RO); for progression during chemotherapy, interval surgery is not indicated as it offers no added survival benefit, with options including alternative chemotherapy regimens, clinical trials, and/or discontinuation of active cancer therapy and initiation of end-of-life care, and in progressive disease there is little role for surgery unless for palliative indications; in basic-resource settings, patients should be referred to higher levels of care or managed with supportive and palliative care; in limited-resource settings, treatment response following NACT should be evaluated by an MDT and guided by imaging, tumor marker analysis, and physical examination, and patients with disease response or stable disease benefit from interval cytoreductive surgery to achieve tumor cytoreduction < 1 cm, ideally to no visible disease (RO); for progressive disease with NACT, options are palliative systemic therapies, enrollment in clinical trials, single-agent therapies, or discontinuation of all therapies and pursuit of end-of-life care, with the decision for additional treatment endorsed by the MDT; in enhanced-resource settings, the same recommendations apply with added capacity for more aggressive cytoreductive procedures by experienced and specialized surgeons and/or gynecologic oncologists.

### Feasibility study of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery for stage III / IV ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancers: Japan clinical oncology group study JCOG0206 [^26f39d35]. Gynecologic Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

To assess the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by interval debulking surgery (IDS) for müllerian carcinomas, such as ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancers, and to determine whether we can omit diagnostic laparoscopy before treatment initiation, a feasibility study was performed.

Methods

Eligible patients had presumed stage III/IV müllerian carcinomas clinically diagnosed by imaging studies, cytology, and tumor markers. All patients underwent diagnostic laparoscopy to confirm the clinical diagnosis. Four cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin were administered as NAC, followed by interval debulking surgery and an additional 4 cycles of chemotherapy. The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving clinical complete remission (cCR) among all stage III/IV müllerian carcinomas confirmed by diagnostic laparoscopy. The major secondary end point was the positive predictive value (PPV) of clinical diagnosis.

Results

Fifty-six patients were enrolled into the study. The PPV of overall clinical diagnosis for the tumor origin, histology, and stage was 95% (53/56). Fifty-three patients received the protocol treatment starting with NAC. IDS was performed in 89% (47/53) of patients. Complete resection without residual tumors was achieved in 55% (29/53) and residual tumors became < 1 cm in 17% (9/53) of patients. Twenty-two patients (42%) achieved cCR after completion of the treatment. The median overall and progression-free survival was 45 and 14 months, respectively.

Conclusion

NAC without diagnostic laparoscopy for advanced müllerian carcinomas holds sufficient promise to be compared with direct surgery in a phase III trial.

### Assessment of adult women with ovarian masses and treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline [^febda71c]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Resource-stratified ovarian cancer assessment and treatment recommendations specify that evaluation of adult symptomatic women in all settings includes symptom assessment, family history, and ultrasound and cancer antigen 125 serum tumor marker levels where feasible, with additional imaging in limited and enhanced settings that may be requested. Diagnosis, staging, and/or treatment involves surgery, presurgical workup of every suspected ovarian cancer requires a metastatic workup, only trained clinicians with logistical support should perform surgical staging, treatment requires histologic confirmation, and the surgical goal is staging disease and performing complete cytoreduction to no gross residual disease. In first-line therapy, platinum-based chemotherapy is recommended and, in advanced stages, patients may receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy; after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, all patients should be evaluated for interval debulking surgery. Targeted therapy is not recommended in basic or limited settings; specialized interventions are resource-dependent, for example, laparoscopy, fertility-sparing surgery, genetic testing, and targeted therapy, and multidisciplinary cancer care and palliative care should be offered.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: ovarian cancer / fallopian tube cancer / primary peritoneal cancer, version 3.2024 [^4453bfe0]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Ovarian cancer — selection of patients for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) with interval debulking surgery (IDS) emphasizes careful eligibility. Based on randomized trials, the NCCN Guidelines recommend considering neoadjuvant therapy for patients with bulky disease that is unlikely to be optimally cytoreduced by up-front surgery. The panel considers current evidence to be insufficient for justifying NACT as an option for patients who by assessment of a gynecologic oncologist are likely to be optimally cytoreduced by upfront surgery. When selecting patients for NACT with IDS, the cancer type of the primary tumor and potential response to primary chemotherapy should be considered. NACT is not appropriate for patients with non-epithelial cancer types (eg, sex cord-stromal or germ-cell tumors) and is not appropriate for patients with disease apparently confined to the ovary. NACT can also be considered for patients who are poor surgical candidates, such as those with poor performance score, in the hopes that tumor load reduction may improve their condition and thereby reduce perioperative risks. In at least one randomized trial, among patients aged 60 to 75 years with stage III/IV disease, NACT improved the rate of successful cytoreduction and other surgical outcomes (reduced operative time and blood loss), although no improvement in PFS or OS was observed. Across trials, the median PFS and OS for both treatment arms were inferior to those in studies of primary debulking surgery followed by postoperative IV chemotherapy for advanced disease (OS mean, ~50 months in the United States), and the median OS in the international trial is 20 months lower than that reported in US trials; this difference may have been a result of selection of higher risk patients in the NACT trials (which did not include patients with stage IIIB or earlier stages).

### A novel classification of residual disease after interval debulking surgery for advanced-stage ovarian cancer to better distinguish oncologic outcome [^6e455060]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Complete surgical resection affords the best prognosis at the time of interval debulking surgery. When complete surgical resection is unachievable, optimal residual disease is considered the next best alternative. Despite contradicting evidence on the survival benefit of interval debulking surgery if macroscopic residual disease remains, the current definition of "optimal" in patients undergoing interval debulking surgery is defined as largest diameter of disease measuring ≤ 1.0 cm, independent of the total volume of disease.

Objective

To examine the relationship between volume and anatomic distribution of residual disease and oncologic outcomes among patients with advanced-stage epithelial ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal carcinoma undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy then interval debulking surgery. For patients who did not undergo a complete surgical resection, a surrogate for volume of residual disease was used to assess oncologic outcomes.

Study Design

Patient demographics, operative characteristics, anatomic site of residual disease, and outcome data were collected from medical records of patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIIC and IV epithelial ovarian cancer undergoing interval debulking surgery from January 2010 to July 2015. Among patients who did not undergo complete surgical resection but had ≤ 1 cm of residual disease, the number of anatomic sites (single location vs multiple locations) with residual disease was used as a surrogate for volume of residual disease. The effect of residual disease volume on progression-free survival and overall survival was evaluated.

Results

Of 270 patients undergoing interval debulking surgery, 173 (64.1%) had complete surgical resection, 34 (12.6%) had ≤ 1 cm of residual disease in a single anatomic location, 47 (17.4%) had ≤ 1 cm of residual disease in multiple anatomic locations, and 16 (5.9%) were suboptimally debulked. Median progression-free survival for each group was 14, 12, 10, and 6 months, respectively (P < .001). Median overall survival for each group was: 58, 37, 26, and 33 months, respectively (P < .001).

Conclusion

Following interval debulking surgery, patients with complete surgical resection have the best prognosis, followed by patients with ≤ 1 cm single-anatomic location disease. In contrast, despite being considered "optimally debulked", patients with ≤ 1 cm multiple-anatomic location disease have a survival similar to suboptimally debulked patients.

### Role of delayed interval debulking for persistent residual disease after more than 5 cycles of chemotherapy for primary advanced ovarian cancer. An international multicenter study [^0e888e7e]. Gynecologic Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Standard of care in patients with advanced ovarian cancer (AOC) is upfront surgery followed by chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and interval debulking surgery (IDS) is an alternative in selected patients. Most data exist with IDS following 3–4 cycles chemotherapy, however, some patients experience a delay of IDS. So far, the impact of a "delayed" interval debulking surgery (DID) is poorly defined.

Methods

We analyzed data from eight international gynecology-oncology referral centers. Patients were included if they had newly diagnosed AOC and were prone to DID (minimum 5 cycles of NACT) between 2011 and 2017.

Results

308 patients underwent DID. 89.6% had a high-grade serous ovarian cancer. The median number of pre-op NACT was 6 cycles (range 5–9) and 6.1% of patients received additionally bevacizumab. The majority of patients had stage-IV disease (51.3%). Median duration of surgery was 210 min (range 34–561), the median surgical complexity score was 4 (range 1–16). Complete resection was achieved in 60.1%. The median number of post-op chemotherapy cycles was 2 (range 0–5). The rate of severe complications (Clavien-Dindo£3°) was 9.7% and 30 days post-op mortality was 0.3%. The median PFS and OS in patients with complete resection was 19.5 and 49.2 months compared to 14.8 and 33.0 months in patients with incomplete resection (p = 0.001), respectively. We did not observe any survival benefit for patients with cytoreduction to small residuals (1–10 mm) compared to residual disease > 1 cm.

Conclusion

Our data may suggest that offering surgery to patients with persistent disease after 5+ cycles could be associated with favorable outcome if a complete resection is achieved. Patients who had residual disease postoperatively may experience rather peri-operative treatment burden than any benefit from DID.

Randomized trials comparing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) plus interval debulking surgery (IDS) versus primary debulking surgery (PDS) — patient selection and regimen structure — state that NACT with IDS should be considered for patients with advanced-stage disease who are not good candidates for PDS, and patients treated with NACT and IDS should also receive postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. Across trials in FIGO stage IIIC–IV disease deemed unlikely to be completely resected, NACT typically consisted of 3–4 cycles of upfront chemotherapy followed by IDS and then 3–4 cycles of postoperative chemotherapy, with several trials allowing IDS only for response or stable disease after NACT, whereas control arms used PDS followed by postoperative chemotherapy to a total of 6 to 8 cycles.

### Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for newly diagnosed, advanced ovarian cancer: Society of Gynecologic Oncology and American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline [^fa91b424]. Gynecologic Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

To provide guidance to clinicians regarding the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and interval cytoreduction among women with stage IIIC or IV epithelial ovarian cancer.

Methods

The Society of Gynecologic Oncology and the American Society of Clinical Oncology convened an Expert Panel and conducted a systematic review of the literature.

Results

Four phase III clinical trials form the primary evidence base for the recommendations. The published studies suggest that for selected women with stage IIIC or IV epithelial ovarian cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy and interval cytoreduction are non-inferior to primary cytoreduction and adjuvant chemotherapy with respect to overall and progression-free survival and are associated with less perioperative morbidity and mortality.

Recommendations

All women with suspected stage IIIC or IV invasive epithelial ovarian cancer should be evaluated by a gynecologic oncologist prior to initiation of therapy. The primary clinical evaluation should include a CT of the abdomen and pelvis, and chest imaging (CT preferred). Women with a high perioperative risk profile or a low likelihood of achieving cytoreduction to < 1cm of residual disease (ideally to no visible disease) should receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Women who are fit for primary cytoreductive surgery, and with potentially resectable disease, may receive either neoadjuvant chemotherapy or primary cytoreductive surgery. However, primary cytoreductive surgery is preferred if there is a high likelihood of achieving cytoreduction to < 1cm (ideally to no visible disease) with acceptable morbidity. Before neoadjuvant chemotherapy is delivered, all patients should have confirmation of an invasive ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer.

### Advanced ovarian cancer: primary or interval debulking? Five categories of patients in view of the results of randomized trials and tumor biology: primary debulking surgery and interval debulking surgery for advanced ovarian cancer [^ccbd0de8]. The Oncologist (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Standard treatment of stage III and IV advanced ovarian cancer (AOC) consists of primary debulking surgery (PDS) followed by chemotherapy. Since the publication of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer/National Cancer Institute of Canada trial, clinical practice has changed and many AOC patients are now treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by interval debulking surgery (IDS). The best option remains unclear. Ovarian cancer is a heterogenic disease. Should we use the diversity in biology of the tumor and patterns of tumor localization to better stratify patients between both approaches?

Methods

This analysis was based on results of five phase III randomized controlled trials on PDS and IDS in AOC patients, three Cochrane reviews, and four meta-analyses.

Results

There is still no evidence that NACT-IDS is superior to PDS. Clinical status, tumor biology, and chemosensitivity should be taken into account to individualize surgical approach. Nonserous (type 1) tumors with favorable prognosis are less chemosensitive, and omitting optimal PDS will lead to less favorable outcome. For patients with advanced serous ovarian cancer (type 2) associated with severe comorbidity or low performance status, NACT-IDS is the preferred option.

Conclusion

We propose stratifying AOC patients into five categories according to patterns of tumor spread (reflecting the biologic behavior), response to chemotherapy, and prognosis to make a more rational decision between PDS and NACT-IDS.

Implications For Practice

Trial results regarding effect and timing of debulking surgery on survival of patients with advanced ovarian cancer have been inconsistent and hence difficult to interpret. This review examines all randomized trials on primary and interval debulking surgery in advanced ovarian cancer, including the results of the newly published CHORUS (chemotherapy or upfront surgery for newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer) trial. On the basis of findings presented in this review and in view of recent molecular data on the heterogeneity of ovarian tumors, we propose prognostic categorization for patients with advanced ovarian cancer to better distinguish those who would optimally benefit from primary debulking from those who would better benefit from interval debulking following neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

### Ovarian cancer staging and follow-up: updated guidelines from the European Society of Urogenital Radiology female pelvic imaging working group [^18aafa59]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ovarian cancer (OC) is the leading cause of death from gynaecologic malignancies, with an observed number of deaths in the EU in 2017 of 26.221 and a prediction of 26.500 deaths in 2022.

The ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer are considered a single entity (referred to as OC for simplicity) because of the similar staging, management, and prognosis. The International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) system, last revised in 2014, is mostly used for staging these cancers and relies on surgical exploration to determine the stage. High-grade serous carcinoma is the most common histologic subtype of OC, and most patients present with advanced-stage disease at diagnosis.

Currently, the mainstay of OC treatment is based on upfront surgery (complete cytoreduction), and a platinum-based combination chemotherapy. The aim of surgery is complete (or at least optimal) cytoreduction. A thorough staging surgery allows for diagnosis, staging, treatment, and assessment of the overall prognosis. The results of the prospective multi-centre randomised Trial of Radical Upfront Surgical Therapy in advanced ovarian cancer (TRUST) are anticipated by the end of 2024. This study is expected to clarify the optimal timing of cytoreductive surgery by comparing outcomes of primary cytoreductive surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy versus neo-adjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval cytoreductive surgery. In the meantime, optimal primary treatment selection is best achieved through multidisciplinary collaboration between gynaecologic surgical oncologists, medical oncologists, pathologists, and radiologists.

With a median follow-up (FU) of 24 months (interquartile range [IQR] 14–34), 90 (43.7%) patients recurred with a 2-year PFS of 47.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 38.7–55.5). The median PFS in the overall population was 24.0 months (95% CI 17.8–30.2). No difference in PFS between FIGO stage III and FIGO Stage IV patients was detected (p = 0.44). Similarly, superimposable PFS was shown between patients receiving 3–4 cycles with respect to women receiving up to 6 cycles of NACT (p = 0.85; Fig. 2 a, b).

### Phase II study of interval debulking surgery followed by intraperitoneal chemotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer: a kansai clinical oncology group study (KCOG9812) [^ba194207]. Gynecologic Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Intraperitoneal chemotherapy (IP) is known to be effective after optimal primary debulking surgery (PDS) for ovarian cancer (OC). Here, we conducted a phase II study to investigate its effectiveness after interval debulking surgery (IDS).

Methods

Thirty-seven patients with FIGO stage IIIB-IV and suboptimal (≥ 1cm diameter) residual disease after PDS were enrolled. Carboplatin (AUC 4 IV, Day 1) and cisplatin (50mg/m² IV, Day 3) were given q21d for 3cycles. After IDS, paclitaxel (175mg/m² IV Day 1 or 60mg/m² IV Days 1, 8, and 15, since 2000) and cisplatin (75mg/m² IP Day 2) were given q21d for 4cycles. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), and secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and adverse events (CTCAE ver. 2.0). Clinical manifestations at first recurrence and subsequent treatment were also surveyed.

Results

Of the 37 patients, high-grade, serous adenocarcinoma was found in 33. Stages IIIB, IIIC, and IV were found in 2, 24, and 11 patients, respectively. After IDS, 23 patients had no macroscopic residual tumor. No patients had permanent enterostomy, febrile neutropenia, or platelet transfusion. The treatment protocol was completed in 22 patients, and discontinued in 5 due to IP catheter-related complications. Median PFS and OS were 22 and 57months, respectively. Among the 28 patients with recurrence, 10 had no intraperitoneal disease at first recurrence. Among the 8 patients who underwent surgical cytoreduction, 6 had no residual tumor, while 2 had a < 1-cm-diameter residual tumor.

Conclusion

IP after IDS for patients with initially suboptimally debulked OC was effective.

### Neoadjuvant chemotherapy or primary surgery in stage IIIC or IV ovarian cancer [^c6ac0623]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

Primary debulking surgery before initiation of chemotherapy has been the standard of care for patients with advanced ovarian cancer.

Methods

We randomly assigned patients with stage IIIC or IV epithelial ovarian carcinoma, fallopian-tube carcinoma, or primary peritoneal carcinoma to primary debulking surgery followed by platinum-based chemotherapy or to neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy followed by debulking surgery (so-called interval debulking surgery).

Results

Of the 670 patients randomly assigned to a study treatment, 632 (94.3%) were eligible and started the treatment. The majority of these patients had extensive stage IIIC or IV disease at primary debulking surgery (metastatic lesions that were larger than 5 cm in diameter in 74.5% of patients and larger than 10 cm in 61.6%). The largest residual tumor was 1 cm or less in diameter in 41.6% of patients after primary debulking and in 80.6% of patients after interval debulking. Postoperative rates of adverse effects and mortality tended to be higher after primary debulking than after interval debulking. The hazard ratio for death (intention-to-treat analysis) in the group assigned to neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking, as compared with the group assigned to primary debulking surgery followed by chemotherapy, was 0.98 (90% confidence interval [CI] 0.84 to 1.13; P = 0.01 for noninferiority), and the hazard ratio for progressive disease was 1.01 (90% CI, 0.89 to 1.15). Complete resection of all macroscopic disease (at primary or interval surgery) was the strongest independent variable in predicting overall survival.

Conclusions

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery was not inferior to primary debulking surgery followed by chemotherapy as a treatment option for patients with bulky stage IIIC or IV ovarian carcinoma in this study. Complete resection of all macroscopic disease, whether performed as primary treatment or after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, remains the objective whenever cytoreductive surgery is performed.

### Staging ovarian cancer: role of imaging [^933cb514]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Ovarian cancer is relatively common, and often presents at an advanced stage with widespread intraperitoneal metastases. The constellation of complex pelvic masses, ascites, omental cake, and other peritoneal implants is virtually diagnostic. All patients are potential surgical candidates, since suspected early stage disease is treated by a comprehensive staging laparotomy including total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and omentectomy. Operable advanced disease is treated by surgical debulking and adjuvant combination chemotherapy. The role of imaging is to detect and characterize adnexal masses as likely malignant, recognize unusual findings that may suggest atypical pathology, demonstrate metastases in order to prevent under-staging, and detect specific sites of disease that may be unresectable. These aims are directly related to clinical management; characterization of an adnexal mass as malignant guides appropriate surgical referral, recognition of atypical pathology such as malignant granulosa cell tumor in a young woman may be an indication for fertility-preserving surgery. Demonstration of metastatic site-assists surgical planning, and detection of unresectable disease may be an indication for neoadjuvant (ie, preoperative) chemotherapy with interval debulking rather than primary debulking with adjuvan (postoperative) chemotherapy.

### Cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: 2025 update [^7d0056f9]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

1.2 Classification rules

Although computed tomography (CT) scans can delineate the intra‐abdominal spread of disease, the specificity and sensitivity for predicting optimal surgical cytoreduction is relatively low. In addition, ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancers should be staged surgically. Fludeoxyglucose‐positron emission tomography (FDG‐PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appear to have a higher diagnostic performance than CT scans but are costly and their role in routine practice is uncertain at present. Operative findings determine the precise histologic diagnosis, stage, and therefore the prognosis of the patient.,

In selected patients with advanced‐stage disease, it is appropriate to initiate chemotherapy before planned surgery after three cycles of treatment. In these cases, histological confirmation of the diagnosis is considered essential before starting neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), not only to be certain of the diagnosis but also to ensure there is sufficient tissue for testing for homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) as well as somatic BRCA testing (see "Interval debulking surgery (IDS)" below).

Chest radiographs may serve as a screen for pleural effusions. As distant metastases are infrequent, there is no requirement for other radiological evaluation unless symptomatic. Serum CA125 levels are useful in determining response to chemotherapy, but they do not contribute to staging.

### Results of interval debulking surgery compared with primary debulking surgery in advanced stage ovarian cancer [^cb50d04c]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Results of IDS (after three to four courses of induction chemotherapy) were compared with PDS followed by chemotherapy in patients treated for advanced stage ovarian cancer (stage IIIC or IV).

Study Design

A retrospective study was done on a group of 57 patients who underwent IDS (because of an unresectable tumor) compared with a group of 28 patients treated with PDS (for resectable disease) followed by chemotherapy. All patients were treated between 1996 and 2001 by the same team of surgeons and received the same regimen of chemotherapy (platinum based plus paclitaxel).

Results

Optimal cytoreductive surgery (residual disease ≤ 2 cm) was achieved in IDS and PDS groups in 84% (48 of 57) and 100% (28 of 28) of patients, respectively. Complete resection was observed in 51% (29 of 57) of patients in the IDS group and 54% (15 of 28) of patients in the PDS group. The rates of bowel resection, large peritoneal resection, and postoperative morbidity were significantly reduced in the IDS group. After adjusting for the size of residual disease (< or / = 2 cm and absence of residual tumor), overall and event-free survival were not different in the two groups.

Conclusions

Survival rates were similar in patients with advanced stage ovarian cancer who underwent IDS or PDS. The rates of surgical resection and morbidity were reduced after IDS. IDS can be safely used in unresectable advanced stage ovarian cancer.

### Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for newly diagnosed, advanced ovarian cancer: ASCO guideline update [^1889bd99]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To provide updated guidance regarding neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and primary cytoreductive surgery (PCS) among patients with stage III-IV epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer (epithelial ovarian cancer [EOC]).

Methods

A multidisciplinary Expert Panel convened and updated the systematic review.

Results

Sixty-one studies form the evidence base.

Recommendations

Patients with suspected stage III-IV EOC should be evaluated by a gynecologic oncologist, with cancer antigen 125, computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis, and chest imaging included. All patients with EOC should be offered germline genetic and somatic testing at diagnosis. For patients with newly diagnosed advanced EOC who are fit for surgery and have a high likelihood of achieving complete cytoreduction, PCS is recommended. For patients fit for PCS but deemed unlikely to have complete cytoreduction, NACT is recommended. Patients with newly diagnosed advanced EOC and a high perioperative risk profile should receive NACT. Before NACT, patients should have histologic confirmation of invasive ovarian cancer. For NACT, a platinum-taxane doublet is recommended. Interval cytoreductive surgery (ICS) should be performed after ≤ four cycles of NACT for patients with a response to chemotherapy or stable disease. For patients with stage III disease, good performance status, and adequate renal function treated with NACT, hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy may be offered during ICS. After ICS, chemotherapy should continue to complete a six-cycle treatment plan with the optional addition of bevacizumab. Patients with EOC should be offered US Food and Drug Administration-approved maintenance treatments. Patients with progressive disease on NACT should have diagnosis reconfirmed via tissue biopsy. Patients without previous comprehensive genetic or molecular profiling should be offered testing. Treatment options include alternative chemotherapy regimens, clinical trials, and/or initiation of end-of-life care. Additional information is available at www.asco.org/gynecologic-cancer-guidelines. This guideline has been endorsed by the Society of Gynecologic Oncology.

### Assessment of adult women with ovarian masses and treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline [^9c19fd87]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To provide expert guidance to clinicians and policymakers in three resource-constrained settings on diagnosis and staging of adult women with ovarian masses and treatment of patients with epithelial ovarian (including fallopian tube and primary peritoneal) cancer.

Methods

A multidisciplinary, multinational ASCO Expert Panel reviewed existing guidelines, conducted a modified ADAPTE process, and conducted a formal consensus process with additional experts.

Results

Existing sets of guidelines from eight guideline developers were found and reviewed for resource-constrained settings; adapted recommendations from nine guidelines form the evidence base, informing two rounds of formal consensus; and all recommendations received ≥ 75% agreement.

Recommendations

Evaluation of adult symptomatic women in all settings includes symptom assessment, family history, and ultrasound and cancer antigen 125 serum tumor marker levels where feasible. In limited and enhanced settings, additional imaging may be requested. Diagnosis, staging, and/or treatment involves surgery. Presurgical workup of every suspected ovarian cancer requires a metastatic workup. Only trained clinicians with logistical support should perform surgical staging; treatment requires histologic confirmation; surgical goal is staging disease and performing complete cytoreduction to no gross residual disease. In first-line therapy, platinum-based chemotherapy is recommended; in advanced stages, patients may receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, all patients should be evaluated for interval debulking surgery. Targeted therapy is not recommended in basic or limited settings. Specialized interventions are resource-dependent, for example, laparoscopy, fertility-sparing surgery, genetic testing, and targeted therapy. Multidisciplinary cancer care and palliative care should be offered. Additional information can be found at www.asco.org/resource-stratified-guidelines. It is ASCO's view that health care providers and health care system decision makers should be guided by the recommendations for the highest stratum of resources available. The guideline is intended to complement but not replace local guidelines.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 ovarian cancer — neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and interval debulking surgery (IDS) timing and total treatment cycles are specified as follows: Because most randomized NACT trials used 3 to 4 cycles before IDS, "3 to 4 cycles of NACT before IDS is preferred, although surgery after 4 to 6 cycles may be used". After "3 to 4 cycles of NACT, patients should be evaluated by a gynecologic oncologist", and for responders likely to have optimal cytoreduction, "IDS with completion hysterectomy/BSO and cytoreduction should be performed". For stable disease after "3 to 4 cycles of NACT" patients "can consider IDS", or "should consider either 1) switching to treatment for persistent/recurrent disease; or 2) treatment with additional cycles of NACT (to a total of ≥ 6 cycles), then re-evaluating". Continuing "beyond 6 cycles is usually reserved" for those tolerating therapy with signs of response; patients with progression "should switch to therapy for persistent/recurrent disease", and those with stable disease "may continue past 6 cycles". Trials "used at least 3 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy after IDS, or indicated that the total number of cycles should be 6 to 8", and the panel "recommend[s] that regardless of the number of cycles of NACT received, IDS should always be followed by adjuvant chemotherapy", with "a minimum of 6 cycles of treatment… including at least 3 cycles of adjuvant therapy after IDS".

### ACR appropriateness criteria on staging and follow-up of ovarian cancer [^b24f3ed8]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Ovarian cancer is the most common cause of cancer death from gynecologic malignancy in women. The diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer are especially challenging because of the high prevalence of benign disease in the ovaries and the tendency for late presentation of ovarian cancer after it has spread. The role of diagnostic imaging is in lesion detection, lesion characterization, preoperative staging, and the prediction of disease resectability that may require chemotherapy and later debulking for improved survival.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: ovarian cancer / fallopian tube cancer / primary peritoneal cancer, version 3.2024 [^0ecbaf16]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Interval debulking surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy — For invasive epithelial ovarian cancer, every effort should be made to achieve maximum cytoreduction during an interval debulking procedure, and consultation with a gynecologic oncologist is recommended. IDS, including completion hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) with staging, should be performed after 3–4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with a response to chemotherapy or stable disease. HIPEC with cisplatin (100 mg/m2) can be considered at the time of IDS for stage III disease, and HIPEC can also be considered for suitable stage IV patients (category 2B) who have had a favorable response to neoadjuvant therapy; sodium thiosulfate may be administered at the start of perfusion, followed by a continuous infusion, to allow for renal protection during HIPEC. All peritoneal surfaces should be visualized and any peritoneal surface or adhesion suspicious for harboring metastasis should be selectively excised or biopsied; an omentectomy should be performed; systematic lymphadenectomy of clinically-negative nodes is not recommended, but suspicious and/or enlarged nodes should be resected, if possible; and procedures that may be considered for optimal surgical debulking include bowel resection and/or appendectomy, stripping of the diaphragm or other peritoneal surfaces, splenectomy, partial cystectomy and/or ureteroneocystostomy, partial hepatectomy, partial gastrectomy, cholecystectomy, and/or distal pancreatectomy.

5.2 Cytoreductive (debulking) surgery for advanced stage disease

5.2.1 Primary debulking

At least two‐thirds of patients with ovarian cancer present with Stage III or IV disease. This may affect the performance status and fitness for surgery. However, the most important prognostic indicator in patients with advanced stage ovarian cancer is the volume of residual disease after surgical debulking. Therefore, patients whose medical condition permits should generally undergo a primary laparotomy with total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo‐oophorectomy, omentectomy, and maximal attempt at optimal cytoreduction. This may necessitate bowel resection, and occasionally, partial or complete resection of other organs. Based on recent data from the randomized Lymphadenectomy in Ovarian Neoplasm (LION) trial, the removal of clinically negative lymph nodes during cytoreductive surgery does not increase the progression‐free or overall survival and should not be undertaken. Level of Evidence A.

5.2.2 Interval debulking

In selected patients with cytologically proven Stage IIIC and IV disease who may not be good surgical candidates, 3–4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) may be given initially, followed by interval debulking surgery and additional chemotherapy as demonstrated in the EROTC and CHORUS Trials. These two randomized prospective trials showed that in selected patients, interval debulking surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy showed equivalent survival with less morbidity compared with primary cytoreductive surgery. NACT followed by interval debulking surgery may be particularly useful in patients with a poor performance status, significant medical comorbidities, visceral metastases, and those who have large pleural effusions and/or gross ascites. In selected patients whose primary cytoreduction is considered suboptimal, particularly if a gynecologic oncologist did not perform the initial operation, interval debulking may be considered after 2–3 cycles of systemic chemotherapy. Pathologic assessment for residual tumor following neoadjuvant therapy will enable an estimate of residual disease and pathological response. There are recent data to indicate that patients who have a good pathological response have a better outcome. A histopathologic scoring system for measuring response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been developed and validated by Bohm et al.who reported criteria for defining a chemotherapy response score (CRS) based on a three‐tier system. A CRS 3 (complete or near complete pathological response) was associated with a better prognosis. Recently, these results have been validated in an independent West Australian cohort.

### Tumour stage, treatment, and survival of women with high-grade serous tubo-ovarian cancer in UKCTOCS: an exploratory analysis of a randomised controlled trial [^768c3215]. The Lancet: Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Procedures

The two annual screening strategies tested were screening with serum CA-125 levels interpreted using a longitudinal algorithm (risk of ovarian cancer) as a primary test plus transvaginal ultrasound as a second-line test to increase specificity (multimodal screening group), and transvaginal ultrasound alone as the primary and second-line test (ultrasound screening group). Women had a median of eight annual screens (345 570 multimodal screening; 327 775 ultrasound screening) until Dec 31, 2011. In both groups, women with persistent abnormalities were assessed by a trial clinician and were further investigated within the NHS. We deemed women who had surgery or a biopsy for suspected ovarian cancer after clinical assessment as screen positive. Screen-detected cancers were those diagnosed following positive screen findings. Women were linked, using their NHS number, to national cancer and death registration data and hospital episodes administrative records. They were also sent three postal questionnaires. Follow-up continued until June 30, 2020. Women were censored for ovarian cancer diagnosis 3 years after end of screening (Dec 31, 2014) as prespecified in the primary mortality analysis. An outcome review committee, masked to randomisation group, adjudicated on ovarian cancer diagnosis (WHO 2014)histotype, stage (FIGO 2014), and cause of death. Treatment details were extracted from hospital records.

Outcomes

The primary outcomes for these exploratory analyses were rates of advanced stage (III, IV, or unable to stage) disease, primary surgery, and zero residual disease after debulking surgery and survival from randomisation until June 30, 2020. Secondary outcomes included rates of primary treatment with surgery and chemotherapy (which included both primary surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy with interval debulking surgery) and first-line combination chemotherapy, cumulative cancer incidence per 100 000 women until Dec 31, 2014, stage-specific case-fatality rates until June 30, 2020, and absolute survival differences at 10, 15, and 18 years after randomisation in women with high grade serous cancer. All outcome data was kept confidential until unmasking.

### Expanding the use of HIPEC in ovarian cancer at time of interval debulking surgery to FIGO stage IV and after 6 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy: a prospective analysis on perioperative and oncologic outcomes [^6868528c]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Similar considerations can be made in relation to the superimposable PFS outcomes of FIGO stage III and stage IV patients submitted to HIPEC and IDS. Even though FIGO stage IV disease appears to be a heterogenous entity in relation to site and number of metastatic lesions which heavily influence treatment strategy, the overall worst prognosis of those patients compared with women with FIGO stage III disease is well established, being 5-year OS in this patients less than 20% in most series. – Although recent prospective data demonstrated that HIPEC seems to upgrade the prognosis of FIGO stage IV patients, it has to be highlighted that in the present study we are limiting the analysis to a group of hyperselected platinum sensitive cases, in which the achievement of minimal (or zero) residual disease at IDS was possible with or without surgical resection at metastatic sites. Of note, median PFS of our population appeared to be approximately 10 months longer than reported by Vandriel et al.(24.0 months vs. 14.2 months); whether this may be related to the administration of maintenance therapy in 81.2% of our population is a concrete possibility.

The main drawbacks of our study are represented by the limited inclusion timeframe and the shortness of FUP, so that we are still not able to assess whether the results are confirmed for OS. Moreover, selection biases in the analyzed population cannot bring to a generalization of this approach.

On the contrary, to our knowledge, this is the first series to analyze the effect of HIPEC at the time of IDS in relation to FIGO stage at diagnosis and number of NACT cycles, which goes slightly beyond data coming from currently available RCT. Other strengths of the study are represented by the prospective collection of data, the monocentric nature of the study, the homogeneous treatment setting and HIPEC protocol throughout the whole population.

### Minimally invasive interval debulking surgery in ovarian neoplasm (MISSION trial-NCT02324595): a feasibility study [^8d33c402]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Laparoscopy has acquired an increasing role in the management of ovarian cancer. Laparoscopic cytoreduction could represent a new frontier for selected patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT).

Objective

We sought to assess feasibility and early complication rate of minimally invasive (MI) interval debulking surgery (IDS) in stage III-IV epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients after NACT.

Study Design

This is a phase II multicentric study in advanced EOC cases with clinical complete response after NACT, according to Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup and Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criteria. Institutional review board approval was obtained and all patients signed written informed consent to be included in the protocol. The study was registered in clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02324595) and was named "MISSION" trial. For patients meeting inclusion criteria, surgical procedures started with diagnostic laparoscopy to confirm preoperative findings and assess surgical complexity. MI-IDS included hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, appendectomy, omentectomy, peritonectomy, and bowel resection. Pelvic and/or aortic lymphadenectomy was not considered as standard procedure in these cases. Intraoperative and postoperative outcomes, time to restart chemotherapy, survival rate, and quality of life data were registered.

Results

From December 2013 through February 2015, of 184 advanced EOC patients considered eligible for IDS, 52 (28.2%) met inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the study. For 22 (12%) of them, standard laparotomic approach was preferred because of intraoperative surgeon evaluation. Thirty (16.3%) patients received the planned treatment of MI-IDS. Median age was 61 (range 39–81) years and median body mass index was 24 (range 20–31) kg/m². Median numbers of NACT cycles was 4 (range 3–7). Median operative time was 285 (range 124–418) minutes and median estimated blood loss was 100 (range 50–200) mL. Surgical procedures included 28 (93.3%) hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, 29 (96.6%) omentectomy, 2 (6.6%) appendectomy, 11 (36.6%) regional peritonectomy, and 1 (3.4%) bowel resection. A residual tumor of 0 cm was reached in 29 (96.6%) patients and 0.5 cm in only 1 (3.4%) case. The vast majority of patients were discharged on postoperative day 2 (range 2–3). No early postoperative complications were registered. Median time to restart chemotherapy was 20 (10–30) days and all patients successfully completed the cycles. Histological findings showed 3 (10%) complete response, 9 (30%) microscopic residual disease, and 18 (60%) evidence of macroscopic residual disease. With a median follow-up of 10.5 month, 5 peritoneal and 2 lymph nodal recurrences were observed. Psychometric test revealed moderate discomfort in the vast majority of patients (66.7%). All patients are still alive.

Conclusion

Invasive-IDS in patients with clinically complete response to NACT seems to be feasible and safe in terms of perioperative outcomes, psycho-oncological impact, and survival rate. The equivalence between MI surgery and laparotomy needs to be confirmed with a longer follow-up and a larger number of patients.

8 FOLLOW‐UP FOR MALIGNANT EPITHELIAL TUMORS

There is no evidence to show that intensive clinical monitoring during follow‐up after completion of primary surgery and chemotherapy with early initiation of chemotherapy in asymptomatic women with recurrent disease improves overall survival or quality of life. In asymptomatic patients with CA125 progression and small volume disease or no radiological evidence of recurrence, it is appropriate to delay starting chemotherapy. However, there may be a subset of patients who are suitable for secondary debulking surgery at the time of recurrence.

The objectives of follow‐up include:
Early recognition and prompt management of treatment‐related complications, including provision of psychological support.
Early detection of symptoms or signs of recurrent disease.
Collection of data regarding the efficacy of any treatment and the complications associated with those treatments in patients treated in clinical trials.
Promotion of healthy behavior, including screening for breast cancer in patients with early‐stage disease, and screening for cervical cancer in patients having conservative surgery.

There are no evidence‐based guidelines regarding the appropriate follow‐up schedule. During the first year following treatment, patients are seen every 3 months with a gradual increase in intervals to every 4–6 months after 2 years and then annually after the fifth year. At each follow‐up, the patient should have her history retaken, including any change in family history of cancers and attention to any symptoms that could suggest recurrence; a physical and pelvic examination should be performed. This is an opportunity to refer appropriate patients for genetic testing if it was not done at diagnosis or during treatment. CA125 has traditionally been checked at regular intervals, but there has been debate regarding the clinical benefit of using CA125 progression alone as a trigger for initiating second‐line chemotherapy. A large MRC OV05‐EORTC 55955 study showed that treating asymptomatic patients with recurrent ovarian cancer with chemotherapy on the basis of CA125 progression alone did not improve survival and early treatment in asymptomatic patients had a negative impact on quality of life. This study has generated considerable debate regarding the use of CA125 for follow‐up, but most agree that it is reasonable not to immediately initiate treatment unless there is a clear clinical indication to do so. The timing of treatment should be based on symptoms as well as clinical and radiological findings. Imaging tests such as ultrasonography of the pelvis, CT, MRI, and/or positron emission tomography (PET) scans should be performed only when the clinical findings or the tumor markers suggest possible recurrence.

Ovarian cancer — management of an increasing CA-125 level in clinical complete remission states that patients with rising CA-125 but no signs or symptoms after a negative pelvic exam and negative chest/abdominal/pelvic CT require individualized management. Patients naïve to chemotherapy should be treated using recommendations for newly diagnosed patients, including clinically appropriate imaging and surgical debulking. Recurrence therapy is defined as treatment to decrease tumor burden, control symptoms, or increase length and/or quality of life. After documentation of biochemical relapse, the median time to clinical relapse is 2 to 6 months, and data suggest immediate treatment for biochemical relapse is not beneficial; therefore, immediate treatment is a category 2B recommendation. After biochemical relapse, recommended options include enrollment in a clinical trial and delaying treatment (observation) until clinical symptoms arise.

### Role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in advanced epithelial ovarian cancer… [^e3610397]. ASCO (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction Primary debulking surgery followed by platinum-based chemotherapy remains the standard treatment of patients with stage III-IV epithelial ovarian cancer. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is an alternative treatment regimen that can be considered in selected patients. Complete cytoreduction, both at primary debulking surgery and interval debulking surgery, has a major positive effect on survival and should be the goal, even if this requires extensive surgery. Evidence in Support of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Advanced Ovarian Cancer Interval debulking after chemotherapy was initially developed as a salvage strategy for patients who had received suboptimal primary surgery. In 1995, van der Burg et al. 9published the first phase III study evaluating the effect of IDS after induction chemotherapy in patients who underwent inadequate surgery before the start of systemic treatment.

OS was prolonged for 6 months in patients who underwent IDS compared with patients who did not receive salvage surgery. 9Using a similar design, the GOG 152 study evaluated the role of IDS in patients who had residual disease after maximal effort cytoreductive surgery in a gynecologic oncology center and observed no improvement in PFS or OS. P = 0. 01 for noninferiority). 6Next, the Chemotherapy or Upfront Surgery trial included 550 women with assumed FIGO stage III and IV ovarian cancer. In this study, the median OS was 22. 6 months in the PDS group versus
24. 1 months in the NACT arm. All phase III trials administered three to four cycles of carboplatin-paclitaxel as neoadjuvant chemotherapy. To our knowledge, debulking surgery after more than four courses of NACT has never been evaluated with an adequate level of evidence.

Surgery after five or more cycles of chemotherapy should be considered salvage surgery and only offered on an individualized basis to patients with a high chance of complete resection. In the JCOG0602 study, only a significant reduction in duration of surgery and the incidence of postoperative grade III/IV adverse events was observed. If residual disease was present after primary debulking surgery in a combined analysis of three multicenter phase III trials.

### Interval from neoadjuvant chemotherapy to interval debulking surgery in advanced ovarian cancer: is this a prognostic indicator? [^8ca603de]. ASCO (2010). Low credibility.

Abstract 5084 Background: We hypothesized that longer interval between neoadjuvant chemotherapy and interval debulking surgery may have an adverse effect on survival. We analyzed the data of patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer to evaluate the effect of interval from last cycle of chemotherapy to interval debulking surgery on progression free and overall survival. Results: Patients' median age was 50 years. 55 patients had stage IIIC and stage IV-31. A median of 3 chemotherapy cycles were administered prior to IDS and the median interval between last cycle of chemotherapy and IDS was 41 days.
67. 5% patients had optimal debulking. 44 patients were operated within 42 days and 42 patients underwent surgery after 42 days. The response rate was higher for patients operated within 42 days.

At a median follow up of 30 months- the median overall and PFS for whole group is 37 months and 13 months, respectively. Both PFS and OS rates are significantly higher for patients operated within 42 days of last chemotherapy cycle; PFS: 18 vs. 9 months, p < 0. 0001, HR-2. 86 and OS: 45 vs. 27 months, p < 0. 003, HR-2.
19. **Conclusions**: This study indicates adverse outcome for patients who undergo interval debulking surgery more than 6 weeks after last cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. No significant financial relationships to disclose. Information Published In Journal of Clinical OncologyVolume 28

### Assessment of adult women with ovarian masses and treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline [^7b720f28]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). High credibility.

ASCO resource-stratified guideline — surgical debulking for stage III and IV ovarian cancer (Recommendation 2.2.1) specifies that the goal of surgical management is to perform optimal tumor cytoreduction, achieved by resecting all visible tumor to < 1 cm and ideally to no visible tumor (R0). There is evidence that leaving residual disease > 1 cm is associated with a reduced chance of cure and negatively affects survival. Because benefit diminishes with suboptimal cytoreduction, all patients benefit from a multidisciplinary team approach, and a skilled surgeon should use clinical and radiologic examinations to determine appropriateness of intervention with the intent to achieve complete surgical debulking with limited morbidity. Given the inherent complexity, surgeons skilled in oncologic surgery or trained gynecologic oncologists are best positioned to manage patients with stage III or IV disease.

NCCN Guidelines Ovarian Cancer — use of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) with interval debulking surgery (IDS) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) states that the guidelines include an option to consider HIPEC at IDS for stage III disease treated with NACT, recommend HIPEC as an option for patients with response or stable disease after NACT (3 cycles preferred, but 4–6 allowed) and recommend that all patients treated with NACT and IDS (± HIPEC) receive postoperative chemotherapy, and indicate that HIPEC can be considered for all stage III patients for whom NACT and IDS is performed without further selection requirements; in contrast, HIPEC is not recommended for patients treated with primary debulking surgery (PDS) without NACT based on a randomized trial that did not improve progression-free survival (PFS) or OS in optimally cytoreduced patients (< 1 cm residual), although in the subset who underwent NACT and IDS long-term follow-up showed a trend toward improved PFS and OS with HIPEC.

Conclusions

A further step on this subject could be represented by the prospective evaluation of HIPEC efficacy in relation to tumor's molecular pattern together with its potential synergistic effect with currently available target therapies for AOC patients. In relation to the demonstrated absence of additional perioperative complications and possible positive survival outcomes, with this study we offer a background to consider the use of HIPEC with cisplatin 100 mg/m² in selected FIGO stage IV patients and women receiving up to 6 cycles of NACT.

### Retrospective study of elderly patients with advanced ovarian cancer who did not undergo surgery [^0e907a1b]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

After decades of clinical practice and exploration, primary debulking surgery has long been the preferred treatment for patients with stage III and IV ovarian cancer. Achieving satisfactory tumor cytoreduction (R0/R1) is a crucial determinant of patient survival. To meet the R0/R1 surgical standards, it is often necessary to resect parts of the bowel, peritoneum, liver, spleen, and other organs. This can subject patients to significant surgical trauma and prolonged postoperative recovery. In cases where advanced ovarian cancer patients have extensive tumor involvement and satisfactory debulking cannot be achieved, neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery serves as a viable alternative.

However, patients in those randomized controlled trials are typically selected based on strict inclusion criteria, often being under the age of 70 and free from comorbidities. With the increasing aging population and extended human lifespan, approximately 70% of elderly patients have at least one chronic disease, and a significant proportion may have 2 to 3 comorbidities. The proportion of elderly patients with ovarian cancer is expected to continue rising, and these patients face significantly higher perioperative risks, postoperative severe complication rates, and mortality rates. In the real world, how should clinicians make informed decisions for such patients?

In this study, the median age of the 15 patients was 73 years. Seven patients (46%) had an ECOG score of 2, and among them, 3 had absolute contraindications to surgery. This reflects the current state of real-world clinical practice, where elderly patients and those with multiple comorbidities often have compromised organ function. This not only increases the risks associated with the perioperative period but also means that even the choice of chemotherapy alone requires careful consideration. In this study, 5 patients were unable to complete the full course of chemotherapy due to intolerable side effects, and among them, 3 were evaluated to have SD. Nevertheless, the DCR of this study reached 100%, with a median PFS1 of 19.0 months and a 1-year PFS rate of 80%. Even patients with SD achieved a minimum PFS1 of 11 months. In this small-sample retrospective cohort, non-surgical treatment demonstrated potential signals of benefit, though validation through large-scale studies is still required.

### Optimizing the treatment of ovarian cancer: neoadjuvant chemotherapy and interval debulking versus primary debulking surgery for epithelial ovarian cancers likely to have suboptimal resection [^814ffc08]. Gynecologic Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To: a) identify prognostic factors in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and interval debulking surgery (IDS), and b) compare post-surgical survival between patients treated with NACT/IDS for presumed unresectable disease and stage IIIC/IV patients who underwent suboptimal primary debulking surgery (PDS).

Methods

This was a retrospective study of consecutive stage IIIC or IV patients undergoing IDS after NACT at Mayo Clinic from January 2007 to December 2013. A subset of patients receiving NACT/IDS for the indication of unresectable disease were matched 1:1 on age and stage to a cohort of patients who underwent suboptimal PDS between 2003 and 2011. Hazard ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were estimated from Cox proportional hazards models.

Results

We identified 87 patients treated with NACT/IDS: the median OS and PFS following surgery was 2.4 and 1.0years, respectively. Factors associated with significantly worse OS were older age (adjusted HR 1.60 per 10-year increase in age, 95% CI 1.18, 2.16) and elevated CA-125 before IDS (adjusted HR 2.30 for CA-125 > 35U/mL, 95% CI 1.25, 4.23). Number of adjuvant chemotherapy cycles administered did not have a significant effect on survival. In the matched cohort analysis of presumed unresectable cases undergoing NACT/IDS vs suboptimal PDS cases (n = 45 each), the NACT/IDS group had a significant OS advantage (HR 0.53; 95% CI 0.32, 0.88), and fewer patients experienced a 30-day postoperative Accordion grade 3/4 complication (11% vs 36%, P = 0.01).

Conclusions

Younger age and normalization of CA-125 prior to IDS are associated with improved survival with NACT/IDS. For primary EOC where resection to residual disease of 1cm or less is unlikely, NACT/IDS is associated with improved survival and reduced perioperative morbidity compared to PDS. As these patients are likely best served by NACT/IDS, more reliable predictors of resectability would be valuable.

Ovarian cancer — interval debulking surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy: HIPEC with cisplatin (100 mg/m2) can be considered at the time of IDS for stage III disease, and HIPEC can also be considered for suitable stage IV patients (category 2B) who have had a favorable response to neoadjuvant therapy both intraperitoneally and extraperitoneally, or in whom stage IV disease sites have completely resolved or are now deemed resectable; sodium thiosulfate may be administered at the start of perfusion, followed by a continuous infusion, to allow for renal protection during HIPEC. While systemic lymphadenectomy of clinically negative nodes is not recommended, suspicious and/or enlarged nodes should be resected, if possible, and removal of lymph nodes noted to have potential metastasis at the time of initial diagnosis should be considered, even if not currently suspicious or enlarged.

### Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in ovarian cancer revisited [^37a167c8]. Annals of Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Despite the recent publication of two randomized controlled phase III trials addressing neoadjuvant chemotherapy in advanced ovarian cancer, the optimal timing of multimodal management in primary therapy is still under debate. As both studies met their primary end point by demonstrating non-inferiority, neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery has been proposed to be an alternative standard for primary ovarian cancer treatment. Nevertheless, significant questions remain unanswered in both trials. Especially, the radicality of surgical therapy was below expectation with the median operating times of < 3 h and complete gross resection in < 20% of the patients. Consecutively, survival rates of patients undergoing primary debulking surgery were low. Since the primarily surgical question of 'primary versus interval-surgery' can only be answered if the key criteria 'complete gross resection' are present in a considerable percentage of patients, additional studies are needed and neoadjuvant chemotherapy should not be used to reduce surgical radicality for ovarian cancer treatment.

### Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery in patients with serous endometrial cancer with transperitoneal spread (stage IV): a new preferred treatment? [^c7d88e8a]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Endometrial cancer is the most frequent malignancy of the female genital tract in the Western world. The most common subtype is endometrioid endometrial cancer (EEC) (80%). Uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC) accounts for 10% and is a highly aggressive variant that is more likely to spread intraperitoneally, similar to ovarian cancer. The incidence of surgical stage IV disease is ∼5–10%, with a 5-year overall survival (OS) ranging from 0–10%. Despite the poor outcome, few data exist regarding the optimal management of patients with stage IV endometrial cancer.

The amount of residual disease after surgery for advanced endometrial cancer has an impact on median survival and progression-free interval (PFI). These data correspond to findings in ovarian cancer. Primary debulking is, however, associated with a considerable rate of postoperative complications: 34–53% in ovarian cancer and 36–39% in endometrial cancer. Moreover, taking into consideration the age and co-morbidities of endometrial cancer patients, there is a need for better treatment options.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) has been used in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer as an alternative approach to conventional primary debulking surgery.

A strategy of NACT enables to identify chemo-sensitive disease that is more likely to benefit from debulking surgery when compared with chemoresistant disease. Furthermore, resection of a reduced tumour burden permits less aggressive surgery and can improve the patients' quality of life by reduced morbidity and shorter operations, intensive care unit stays and overall hospitalisations. A disadvantage of this neoadjuvant approach was the potential for a worse survival when compared with primary debulking. In addition, when the neoadjuvant approach was introduced, some reluctance existed regarding post-chemotherapy complications at the time of major surgery.

Cytotoxic therapy leads to morphological and histopathological changes within tumour tissue and in involved stromal tissue. Successful treatment results in fibrosis and scarring of tumoral stroma and the surrounding tissue. Histopathological tumour regression has been established as the gold standard for the assessment of treatment response in several types of solid tumours (osteosarcomas, gastric, oesophageal and non-small-cell lung cancer). A histopathological assessment of tumour regression in ovarian cancer patients showed a correlation between the composite pathological tumour response score and prolonged progression-free survival.

NCCN ovarian cancer — monitoring response to adjuvant systemic therapy states that "After completion of chemotherapy, patients should be assessed for response during and following treatment and monitored for any long-term complications". For early disease, "Patients who have completed primary treatment for stage I disease (surgery alone or with adjuvant systemic therapy) should be monitored for recurrence". For those with more advanced disease, "For patients who have completed postoperative chemotherapy as part of primary therapy for stage II–IV disease, imaging is recommended as clinically indicated to determine the extent of disease, if any". "Recommended imaging modalities include chest/abdominal/pelvic CT, MRI, PET/CT, or PET (skull base to mid-thigh)". Additionally, "All imaging should be performed with contrast unless contraindicated". The section further notes, "Patients who have CR, with no evidence of disease, or PR may be eligible for maintenance", and to "Consider symptom management and best supportive care, and refer for palliative care assessment, if appropriate".

### Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for newly diagnosed, advanced ovarian cancer: ASCO guideline update [^a966fb85]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for ovarian cancer, more specifically with respect to management of advanced disease, chemotherapy, ASCO 2025 guidelines recommend to offer post-interval cytoreductive surgery chemotherapy, preferably with a platinum-taxane doublet, in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Administer a total of 6 cycles of treatment, including neoadjuvant chemotherapy and post-interval cytoreductive surgery chemotherapy. Adjust the exact number of post-interval cytoreductive surgery chemotherapy cycles based on patient-specific factors and response to treatment. Consider adding bevacizumab to chemotherapy after adequate post-surgical healing.

### Early tumor regrowth is a contributor to impaired survival in patients with completely resected advanced ovarian cancer. An exploratory analysis of the intergroup trial AGO-OVAR 12 [^b0ebe25d]. Gynecologic Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Surgical assessment of residual tumor provides the strongest prognostic information in advanced ovarian cancer (AOC), with the best outcome observed after complete resection. Postoperative radiological assessment before initiation of chemotherapy can supplement the information obtained by surgical assessment; however, it may also reveal conflicting findings.

Methods

Patients with AOC enrolled in the AGO-OVAR 12 trial underwent baseline imaging before the first chemotherapy cycle. The findings from surgical and radiologic assessment for disease extend were compared. Additionally, an integrated approach was assessed.

Results

Complete data from all 3 assessment methods were available for 1345 patients. Of 689 patients with complete resection, tumor was observed in 28% and 22% of patients undergoing radiologic and integrated assessment, respectively. Patients with surgical- radiological and surgical-integrated concordant findings showed a 5-year overall survival (5Y-OS) of 72% and 71%, whereas patients with surgical-radiological and surgical-integrated discordant results showed inferior 5Y-OS of 47% and 49%, respectively. Patients with surgically assessed residual disease had a 5-YOS of 37%. The interval between surgery and baseline assessment was independently associated with discordance between assessment methods, which might reflect early tumor regrowth.

Conclusions

Baseline tumor assessment before chemotherapy provides information that stratifies patients with complete resection into different prognostic groups. Integrating the data from different assessment methods might lead to improved definitions of prognostic groups. Further investigation to determine if earlier initiation of chemotherapy after debulking surgery could increase survival of patients with early tumor regrowth is warranted.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: ovarian cancer / fallopian tube cancer / primary peritoneal cancer, version 3.2024 [^50e2b14a]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN ovarian cancer — neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) with interval debulking surgery (IDS) versus primary debulking surgery (PDS) trial design and populations are characterized as follows: These trials focused on patients with FIGO stage IIIC–IV ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that was deemed unlikely to be completely resected. In NACT arms, regimens typically consisted of 3–4 cycles of upfront chemotherapy, followed by IDS with the goal of maximum cytoreduction, followed by 3–4 cycles of postoperative chemotherapy. Control arms consisted of PDS (with the goal of maximum cytoreduction) followed by postoperative chemotherapy to a total of 6 to 8 cycles. Several prospective randomized trials have compared an NACT approach (with IDS and postoperative chemotherapy) versus conventional treatment.

### Results of interval debulking surgery in advanced stage ovarian cancer: an exposed-non-exposed study [^a812378f]. Annals of Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

To study the results of interval debulking surgery (IDS) in patients treated for 'unresectable' advanced stage ovarian cancer compared with primary debulking surgery (PDS) followed by chemotherapy.

Patients and Methods

An exposed-non-exposed study including a group of 34 patients who underwent an IDS and were matched to an historic control group of 34 patients treated with PDS.

Results

Optimal cytoreductive surgery was achieved in 94% (32 out of 34) of patients in both groups. The rates of post-operative morbidity, blood transfusion and median length of hospitalisation were significantly reduced in the study (IDS) group, but survival did not differ in both groups.

Conclusions

IDS in patients with advanced stage ovarian cancer offers the same chance of survival as PDS, but it is better tolerated.

### Atezolizumab, bevacizumab, and chemotherapy for newly diagnosed stage III or IV ovarian cancer: placebo-controlled randomized phase III trial (IMagyn050 / GOG 3015 / ENGOT-OV39) [^65d8f1b3]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

PD-L1 expression was determined in the baseline tumor tissue sample collected during primary cytoreductive surgery in the primary surgery cohort and from pretreatment tumor tissue samples in the neoadjuvant cohort. Additional tissue samples were collected at the time of interval surgery in the neoadjuvant cohort. In post hoc exploratory analyses, tumors with ≥ 5% PD-L1 IC expression were categorized as PD-L1–positive high. Samples were also evaluated for tumor cell (TC) staining, with < 1% TC staining considered to be PD-L1 TC–negative and ≥ 1% TC considered to be PD-L1 TC–positive.

In the primary cytoreductive surgery group, tumors were assessed by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis within 28 days before random assignment, then every 9 weeks during the concurrent treatment phase, every 12 weeks in the maintenance phase, every 3 months for the first 2 years after completing treatment, and every 6 months for the next 3 years. Thereafter, patients were followed as clinically indicated. Patients in the neoadjuvant cohort followed a similar tumor assessment schedule; however, an additional tumor assessment was performed after interval surgery to determine a new baseline tumor status. The next scan was to be done 9 weeks later. Thereafter, the tumor assessment schedule matched that described for the primary cytoreductive surgery group.

Adverse events (AEs) were recorded at every cycle and graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0.

Outcomes

The co-primary end points were investigator-assessed PFS (according to RECIST v1.1) and OS in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and in the population of patients with PD-L1–positive tumors.

Secondary end points included objective response rate (confirmed complete or partial response according to RECIST v1.1 in patients with measurable residual disease after primary surgery), duration of response in these patients, patient-reported outcomes, and the occurrence and severity of AEs.

European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Study design and drug administration

This study was a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled phase II trial registered as NCT01583322 ARCAGY/ GINECO GROUP GINECO-OV119. Informed written consent was obtained from each patient.

Eligible were patients with first diagnosis of histological confirmed (cytology alone excluded) epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer, FIGO stages IIIc-IV, ECOG performance status < 2, and life expectancy of at least 6 months. Histology had to be obtained by laparoscopy (or by laparotomy), in patients for whom primary debulking surgery had been denied and maximum surgical effort of cytoreduction with the goal of non-residual disease was planned as interval debulking surgery.

Patients were randomized (2:1) to be treated with 3–4 cycles of carboplatin (AUC5) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m 2) before interval debulking surgery followed by 2 to 3 adjuvant cycles (for a total of 6 cycles) plus either 400 mg daily nintedanib (experimental arm) or placebo at cycles 1 and 2 and 5 and 6 and maintenance therapy for up to 2 years.

The PET ancillary study was optional in the workup of the CHIVA trial, which included a total of 188 patients.

Site qualification

All patients were scanned on a dedicated, full-ring PET/CT, using the same PET/CT system for the pre- and post-treatment scans. Participating sites were requested to comply with the EANM guidelines for PET tumor imaging, especially with regard to cross calibration between the dose calibrator and the PET system, uptake time (60 ± 5 min) and consistency for acquisition and reconstruction parameters for baseline and post-treatment scans. In the case uptake time was not respected for the baseline scan for any logistical problem, centers were requested to keep the same uptake time for the post-treatment examination.

This study involved 9 PET centers and a total of 13 PET/CT systems.

### Prospective validation of the role of PET / CT in detecting disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in advanced ovarian cancer [^1e17415f]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The study aimed to compare the diagnostic accuracies of 2-[18 F]FDG PET/CT and contrast-enhanced CT (ceCT) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in advanced ovarian cancer (OC).

Materials and methods

This study consisted historical observational cohort and prospective validation cohort. Patients with newly diagnosed stage III–IV OC scheduled for NACT were recruited, with imaging performed after three to six cycles of NACT before interval debulking surgery. Nineteen regions in the abdominopelvic cavity were scored for the presence and absence of disease, referenced to the intra-operative findings or histological specimens. Diagnostic metrics were compared using McNemar's test.

Results

In the historical cohort (23 patients, age 58 ± 13), 2-[18 F]FDG PET had an overall accuracy (Acc) 82%, sensitivity (Sen) 38%, specificity (Spe) 97%, positive predictive value (PPV) 79% and negative predictive value (NPV) 82%; ceCT had an overall Acc 86%, Sen 64%, Spe 93%, PPV 75% and NPV 89%. In the prospective cohort (46 patients, age 59 ± 9), 2-[18 F] FDG PET had an overall Acc 87%, Sen 48%, Spe 98%, PPV 84% and NPV 88%; ceCT had an overall Acc 89%, Sen 66%, Spe 95%, PPV 77% and NPV 91%. No significant difference was demonstrated between the two imaging modalities (p > 0.05). High false-negative rates were observed in the right subdiaphragmatic space, omentum, bowel mesentery and serosa. High omental metabolic uptake after NACT was associated with histological non-responders (p < 0.05).

Conclusion

2-[18 F]FDG PET/CT had no additional value over ceCT with comparable diagnostic accuracy in detecting disease after NACT in advanced OC.

Clinical relevance statement

2-[18 F]FDG PET/CT is not superior to contrast-enhanced CT in determining disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in advanced ovarian cancer; contrast-enhanced CT should be suffice for surgical planning before interval debulking surgery.

Key Points

- Additional value of 2-[18 F]FDG PET/CT over contrast-enhanced CT is undefined in detecting disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

- 2-[18 F]FDG PET/CT has comparable diagnostic accuracy compared to contrast-enhanced CT.

- Contrast-enhanced CT will be suffice for surgical planning after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: ovarian cancer / fallopian tube cancer / primary peritoneal cancer, version 3.2024 [^ee354e79]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Initial surgery components and stage scope — For most patients presenting with suspected malignant ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal neoplasm, initial surgery should include a hysterectomy (if uterus present) and BSO with comprehensive staging and debulking as indicated. This is the recommended approach for stage IA–IV if optimal cytoreduction appears feasible, the patient is a surgical candidate, and fertility is not a concern. For patients with early-stage disease who wish to preserve fertility, less extensive surgery may be an option. For advanced-stage ovarian cancer in patients not good candidates for primary debulking surgery (PDS) due to advanced age, frailty, poor performance status, comorbidities, or disease unlikely to be optimally cytoreduced, NACT with interval debulking surgery (IDS) should be considered.

Ovarian cancer primary treatment — presumed ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer usually consists of appropriate surgical staging and debulking surgery, followed in most (but not all) patients by systemic chemotherapy; for some patients with early-stage disease, surgery alone (followed by observation) may be sufficient. NACT with interval debulking surgery (IDS) should be considered in patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer who are not good candidates for upfront primary debulking surgery (PDS) due to advanced age, frailty, poor performance status, comorbidities, or disease unlikely to be optimally cytoreduced. In the primary treatment setting, PARP inhibitors have been incorporated as NCCN-recommended maintenance therapy options for select patients after first-line chemotherapy. For all patients with suspected or confirmed ovarian cancer a gynecologic oncologist should be involved in assessing candidacy for surgery and/or neoadjuvant therapy, and the NCCN Guidelines recommend symptom management and best supportive care for all patients with referral for palliative care assessment if appropriate.

### Immunotherapy may improve tumor sensitivity to palliative chemotherapy in platinum resistant ovarian cancer [^bebba523]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Case 1

Patient #1 was a 69-year-old female diagnosed with FIGO stage IIIC clear cell ovarian cancer. She was initially treated with neoadjuvant taxotere and carboplatin for 3 cycles followed by total abdominal hysterectomy, right salpingo-oophorectomy and interval debulking surgery. This was followed by 3 additional cycles of adjuvant taxotere and carboplatin, at which point she had no evidence of disease and normalization of her CA-125. She then received single-agent maintenance bevacizumab for 5 months until progression of disease was noted. This was followed by 3 cycles of liposomal doxorubicin until progression was again seen with liver, lung and retroperitoneal lymph node metastases. Due to her platinum-resistant disease, she was enrolled in the phase II National Cancer Institute (NCI)-NRG clinical trial GY003 of nivolumab with or without ipilimumab and was randomized to the combination therapy arm of nivolumab plus ipilimumab. Her treatment was complicated by grade 4 lipase elevation after cycle 1 and she was continued on nivolumab alone for cycles 2–4. Surveillance imaging after 4 cycles of immunotherapy showed a partial response with an interval decrease in both the size of retroperitoneal lymph nodes and number hepatic lesions with no new metastatic lesions in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis (Fig. 1a, b).

### The impact of inter-cycle treatment delays on overall survival in patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer [^53357b1a]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ovarian cancer is highly prevalent on a global scale, with an estimated 313,000 new cases recorded in 2022and around 7400 women diagnosed annually in the UK. Currently, no reliable screening test exists for ovarian cancer, and consequently most women are diagnosed at advanced stages (FIGO stages 3 or 4) after becoming symptomatic from their disease. Survival outcomes are poor in patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer, with 2-year survival rates of around 41% for stage 3 patients, and 31% for stage 4 patients in the UK.

Standard treatment for advanced-stage ovarian cancer involves cytoreductive (debulking) surgery followed by treatment with adjuvant or neoadjuvant systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT) using platinum-based chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery. Treatment delays (between chemotherapy treatments) are often used to allow time for the patient to recover from toxicity and to maintain an acceptable quality of life (QoL). In advanced stages of disease, when survival outcomes are poor, there is a trade-off between increasing length of life through systemic treatment and maintaining QoL through minimizing drug toxicity. Treatments that are too aggressive can increase toxicity and the likelihood of additional hospital attendances, further increasing the burden of chemotherapy treatment for patients. Toxicity can be managed proactively by improving clinical monitoring and access to specialist clinics to address drug-related problems early in the course of an adverse-event, so that fewer patients require hospital admission for management of symptoms. Treatment delays will however be required for many patients to allow time for recovery from adverse- events.

Reports of the frequency of treatment delays in patients with ovarian cancer range widely, from 14.6% to 43.4% of treatments given during a standard chemotherapy regimen. The impact of delays on survival outcomes is, however, poorly understood, with some evidence suggesting that treatment delays can reduce survival through impaired dose intensity. Characterizing the impact of delays between chemotherapy cycles is essential to allow clinicians to make informed decisions about patient management, and to communicate with patients about the risks and benefits of delaying chemotherapy treatment. Several studies investigating the impact of delays in ovarian cancer have used small sample sizes or specific sub-groups, such as elderly patients, however this question has not yet been addressed in a large, population-based cohort.

Further investigation into the association of delays with survival outcomes in advanced-stage ovarian cancer patients is warranted. This work aims to provide evidence that can inform approaches to optimize both chemotherapy treatment benefit and QoL for advanced stage ovarian cancer patients.

### Scottish ovarian cancer forum [^c0ca0ee7]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Strategy

The original plan was to discuss all women with stages 3/4 ovarian cancer (upfront and interval) but case selection had to be modified. If there was an obvious contraindication to upfront surgery, that is, extreme age (> 85), PS3/4 at presentation or significant recent thromboembolic event then these patients were not discussed for upfront surgery. Assessment of these patients was deferred until after completion of 3–4 cycles of chemotherapy.

Due to radiology constraints and time, patient numbers had to be caped (to 2 at each centre) with a maximum of 6–8 patients at any one meeting. It had been proposed for radiologists to present cases from other centres but the practicalities of this (despite numerous meetings) were overwhelming and therefore this was not achieved.

At the onset of the project, it was rapidly transparent that radiological staging differed between regions. Variation in staging throughout Scotland had been previously highlighted in Ovarian Cancer Survival Analysis (ISD 2018) with much debate about variation in patient population vs radiological reporting. Urgent clarification was needed and a second national meeting took place September 2022. While this work was ongoing prior to the project, there is no doubt that the discrepancies identified in this pilot project brought about a need for urgent resolution and consensus.

A national radiology staging guideline has been agreed and the document has been endorsed and adapted into clinical practice in the three cancer networks in Scotland.

### Survival benefits of dose-dense early postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy in front-line therapy for advanced ovarian cancer: a randomised controlled study [^3858258b]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Trial design and procedure

The AICE study was an investigator-initiated multicentre, randomised, unblinded, controlled, phase 2 trial to assess the efficacy and safety of DD-EPIC in the front-line therapy of advanced ovarian cancer. The study design and the detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as the baseline characteristics and primary outcome results have been previously described. Briefly, eligible patients were aged 18–75 years; with stage IIIC and IV primary epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or peritoneal cancer, excluding lymph node metastasis alone; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0–2; no more than three cycles of chemotherapy prior to surgery; with optimal (≤ 1 cm residual disease) debulking surgery. Randomisation was done using 1:1 allocation, and was performed after debulking surgery. DD-EPIC was defined to be started at 5–10 days after surgery, and no more than 14 days postoperative for those with bowel resection.

After randomisation, patients received either four doses of weekly DD-EPIC with cisplatin 50 mg/m² and etoposide 100 mg/m² followed by six cycles of IV carboplatin AUC 5 and paclitaxel 175 mg/m² or docetaxel 60–75 mg/m² every 3 weeks (the DD-EPIC group) or standard six cycles of IV carboplatin AUC 5 and paclitaxel 175 mg/m² or docetaxel 60–75 mg/m² every 3 weeks (the IV group).

Each patient was followed every 3 months over the first 5 years, and then every 6 months thereafter, during which physical examination, CA125 levels and radiological images (ultrasound, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) were performed. Progression was defined by one or more of the following items: physical examination, elevated CA125 levels according to the Gynecologic Oncology Intergroup criteria and/or radiological images. Each progression event was confirmed by centre principle investigators.

### Future directions in the surgical management of ovarian cancer [^e4b3681b]. Gynecologic Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The surgical management of ovarian cancer is surrounded by controversy. This review summarizes our current understanding of these issues with the goal of improving survival, enhancing quality of life, and containing costs.

Methods

Six currently unresolved issues are addressed through a review of the existing literature: (1) the extent of surgery indicated in the primary surgical management of advanced-stage disease, (2) the prognostic features of ovarian cancer, (3) the role of interval debulking following neoadjuvant chemotherapy, (4) the role of fertility-sparing surgery, (5) the role of "second-look" surgery, and (6) the role of secondary tumor debulking.

Results

The criteria for justifying extraordinary measures to reduce the tumor burden in patients with advanced disease to an "optimal" state have not been established. Likewise, the factors that influence prognosis and treatment are not well defined or understood. Interval debulking following neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a promising approach to the management of advanced-stage disease, but no clinical trials have been conducted comparing it to primary surgery followed by chemotherapy. Fertility-sparing surgery may be appropriate even for women with frankly malignant epithelial cancers when disease is confined to one ovary. No convincing data are available showing that second-look surgery improves the chances for cure or prolongs survival. Finally, few data show a benefit from secondary tumor resection in patients who progress while undergoing first-line chemotherapy or have a recurrence soon afterward.

Conclusions

Controlled clinical trials are needed to guide clinicians in making appropriate management decisions for their patients.

Management of an increasing CA-125 level in clinical complete remission is described as somewhat controversial and includes patients with an increasing CA-125 level but no signs or symptoms of recurrent disease following an evaluation including a negative pelvic examination and negative chest/abdominal/pelvic CT scans. Patients who have never received chemotherapy (ie, naïve to chemotherapy) should be treated using recommendations for newly diagnosed patients, should undergo clinically appropriate imaging studies and surgical debulking, and should be treated as previously described. After the documentation of an increased CA-125 level (ie, biochemical relapse), the median time for a clinical relapse is 2 to 6 months. Data suggest that immediate treatment for biochemical relapse is not beneficial; therefore, immediate treatment is a category 2B recommendation in the NCCN Guidelines. After biochemical relapse, recommended options include enrollment in a clinical trial and delaying treatment (ie, observation) until clinical symptoms arise. Recurrence therapy refers to drugs, radiation, or other treatment that is given to decrease tumor burden, control symptoms, or increase length and/or QOL for patients with recurrent disease.

Ovarian cancer maintenance therapy eligibility — after primary chemotherapy, the NCCN Guidelines state that all the IV and IP/IV regimens recommended for neoadjuvant/adjuvant primary chemotherapy in patients with stage II–IV high-grade serous or endometrioid disease include 6 cycles of platinum-based combination chemotherapy. SOLO-1, PAOLA-1, and PRIMA required patients to have complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) before initiation of maintenance therapy, and subgroup analyses in SOLO-1 and PRIMA showed that progression-free survival (PFS) benefit from single-agent PARP inhibitor maintenance was significant regardless of depth of response after first-line systemic therapy. VELIA did not require CR or PR after primary chemotherapy for veliparib maintenance and did not report response rate for the overall population. The NCCN recommendations for maintenance bevacizumab and PARP inhibitors apply to patients with a CR (no evidence of disease) or PR after debulking surgery and chemotherapy, including those treated with primary debulking surgery (PDS) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and those treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), interval debulking surgery (IDS), and adjuvant chemotherapy, and maintenance therapy is not recommended for patients who have progressive or stable disease on primary treatment; these patients should be treated with recurrence therapy options.

Limited-resource settings

Treatment response following NACT should be evaluated by an MDT and guided by imaging, tumor marker analysis, and physical examination. Response to NACT may be indicative of a greater likelihood of benefit from interval cytoreductive surgery. Patients with disease response or stable disease benefit from interval cytoreductive surgery to achieve tumor cytoreduction < 1 cm, ideally to no visible disease (R0) where feasible, otherwise achieve tumor cytoreduction to < 1 cm.

Options for patients with progressive disease with NACT are palliative systemic therapies, enrollment in clinical trials, single-agent therapies, or discontinuation of all therapies and pursuit of end-of-life care. There is a laimited role for surgery in patients with poor response to chemotherapy. The decision for additional treatment in patients with progressive disease with NACT should be endorsed by the MDT, weighing the risks and benefits in patients with poor survival outcomes.

Enhanced-resource settings

The same recommendations apply as in limited settings, with added capacity for more aggressive cytoreductive procedures by experienced and specialized surgeons and/or gynecologic oncologists.

### Does the method of primary treatment affect the pattern of first recurrence in high-grade serous ovarian cancer? [^f463bcd0]. Gynecologic Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine if the primary treatment approach (primary debulking surgery (PDS) versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy and interval debulking surgery (NACT-IDS)) influences the pattern of first recurrence in patients with completely cytoreduced advanced high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC).

Materials and Methods

This retrospective study included 178 patients with newly diagnosed stage IIIC-IV HGSOC, complete gross resection during PDS (n = 124) or IDS (n = 54) from January 2008-March 2013, and baseline and first recurrence contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans. Clinical characteristics and number of disease sites at baseline were analyzed for associations with time to recurrence. In 135 patients who experienced recurrence, the overlap in disease locations between baseline and recurrence and the number of new disease locations at recurrence were analyzed according to the primary treatment approach.

Results

At univariate and multivariate analyses, NACT-IDS was associated with more overlapping locations between baseline and first recurrence (p ≤ 0.003) and fewer recurrences in new anatomic locations (p ≤ 0.043) compared with PDS. The same results were found in a subgroup that received intra-peritoneal adjuvant chemotherapy after either treatment approach. At univariate analysis, patient age, primary treatment approach, adjuvant chemotherapy route, and number of disease locations at baseline were associated with time to recurrence (p ≤ 0.009). At multivariate analysis, older patient age, NACT-IDS, and greater disease locations at baseline remained significant (p ≤ 0.018).

Conclusion

The distribution of disease at the time of first recurrence varied with the choice of primary treatment. Compared to patients treated with PDS, patients who underwent NACT-IDS experienced recurrence more often in the same locations as the original disease.

6.3 Neoadjuvant chemotherapy

An increasing proportion of patients with advanced stage ovarian cancer are being treated with upfront neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) for 3–4 cycles prior to interval debulking and further chemotherapy. This is based on the results of four trials that have reported equivalent outcomes for progression‐free survival and overall survival, but less morbidity and lower mortality compared with primary debulking surgery (PDS). Vergote et al.reported the results in 2010 of the first randomized EORTC‐NCIC (National Cancer Institute of Canada) study of PDS versus three cycles of NACT followed by interval debulking. All the patients had extensive Stage IIIC or IV disease. Patients were randomly assigned either to PDS followed by at least six courses of platinum‐based chemotherapy or to three cycles of neoadjuvant platinum‐based chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery in all patients with a response or stable disease, followed by at least three further courses of platinum‐based chemotherapy. The median progression‐free survival in both groups was 12 months. The median overall survival was also similar at 29 months versus 30 months (PDS vs NACT). There was lower postoperative morbidity and mortality in the NACT group. The median overall survival was considerably less than the 60+ months expected with PDS and optimal cytoreduction followed by chemotherapy, suggesting that the study included a cohort of patients with very advanced disease and poor prognosis. The study provoked much discussion and debate regarding the role of NACT.

The Chemotherapy or Upfront Surgery (CHORUS) trial randomized patients to NACT followed by interval debulking and then three additional cycles or PDS followed by six cycles of platinum‐based chemotherapy. The optimal debulking rate was only 16% in the PDS group compared with 40% following NACT, which are lower than would be expected. The median duration of surgery was only 120 min in both groups, which was criticized as it did not seem to be long enough for aggressive debulking surgery and optimal cytoreduction. There was a 5.6% postoperative mortality rate in the PDS group, which is high. The median progression‐free survival was 12 months in both groups, and the median overall survival was similar at 22.6 months versus 24.1 months (PDS vs NACT).

### NCCN guidelines® insights: ovarian cancer / fallopian tube cancer / primary peritoneal cancer, version 3.2024 [^55d6484e]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN ovarian cancer primary treatment — initial management and systemic therapy — states that primary treatment for presumed ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer usually consists of surgical staging and debulking followed in most patients by systemic chemotherapy, though for some early-stage cases surgery alone (followed by observation) may be sufficient. For certain histologic subtypes, adjuvant therapy with hormonal agents are options that may be considered. NACT with interval debulking surgery (IDS) should be considered in advanced-stage ovarian cancer when patients are not good candidates for upfront primary debulking surgery (PDS) due to advanced age, frailty, poor performance status, comorbidities, or disease unlikely to be optimally cytoreduced. In the primary treatment setting, PARP inhibitors have been incorporated as NCCN-recommended maintenance therapy options for select patients after first-line chemotherapy, and emerging data support an increasing role of PARP inhibitors in the management of ovarian cancer. A gynecologic oncologist should be involved in assessing surgical and neoadjuvant candidacy with consideration of laparoscopic evaluation to determine feasibility of debulking surgery, and the NCCN Guidelines recommend symptom management and best supportive care for all patients with referral for palliative care assessment if appropriate.

### ACR appropriateness criteria staging and follow-up of ovarian cancer [^255fc1fb]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Imaging is used to detect and characterize adnexal masses and to stage ovarian cancer both before and after initial treatment, although the role for imaging in screening for ovarian cancer has not been established. CT and MRI have been used to determine the resectability of tumors, the candidacy of patients for effective cytoreductive surgery, the need for postoperative chemotherapy if debulking is suboptimal, and the need for referral to a gynecologic oncologist. Radiographic studies such as contrast enema and urography have been replaced by CT and other cross-sectional imaging for staging ovarian cancer. Contrast-enhanced CT is the procedure of choice for preoperative staging of ovarian cancer. MRI without and with contrast may be useful after equivocal CT, but is usually not the best initial procedure for ovarian cancer staging. Fluorine-18-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-PET/CT may not be needed preoperatively, but its use is appropriate for detecting and defining post-treatment recurrence. Ultrasound is useful for evaluating adnexal disease, but has limited utility for staging ovarian cancer. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances where evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Expanding the use of HIPEC in ovarian cancer at time of interval debulking surgery to FIGO stage IV and after 6 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy: a prospective analysis on perioperative and oncologic outcomes [^88809255]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Randomized data on patients with FIGO stage III ovarian cancer receiving ≤ 3 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) showed that hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) after interval debulking surgery (IDS) improved patient's survival. We assessed the perioperative outcomes and PFS of FIGO stage IV and/or patients receiving up to 6 cycles of NACT undergoing IDS+HIPEC.

Methods

Prospectively collected cases from January 1, 2019 to July 31, 2022 were included. Patients underwent HIPEC if: age ≥ 18 years but < 75 years, body mass index ≤ 35 kg/m², ASA score ≤ 2, FIGO stage III/IV epithelial disease treated with up to 6 cycles of NACT, and residual disease < 2.5 mm.

Results

A total of 205 patients were included. No difference was found in baseline characteristics between FIGO Stage III and IV patients, whereas rate of stable disease after NACT (p = 0.004), mean surgical complexity score at IDS (p = 0.001), and bowel resection rate (p = 0.046) were higher in patients undergoing delayed IDS. A lower rate of patients with at least one G3–G5 postoperative complications was observed in FIGO stage IV versus FIGO stage III disease (5.3% vs. 14.0%; p = 0.052). This difference was confirmed at multivariable analysis (odds ratio [OR] 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.07–0.80; p = 0.02), whereas age, SCS, bowel resection, and number of cycles did not affect postoperative complications. No difference in PFS was identified neither between FIGO stage III and IV patients (p = 0.44), nor between 3 and 4 versus > 4 cycles of NACT (p = 0.85).

Conclusions

Because of the absence of additional complications and positive survival outcomes, HIPEC administration can be considered in selected FIGO stage IV and patients receiving > 4 cycles of NACT.

NCCN ovarian cancer — Therapy for recurrence in low-grade serous carcinoma includes surgical and systemic options. Secondary cytoreduction can be considered for patients with a long disease-free interval, isolated masses rather than diffuse carcinomatosis on imaging, and/or bowel obstruction. Systemic therapy is another option, and the guidelines emphasize that there is no standard sequencing of drugs for recurrent disease; each patient should be evaluated individually. Recommended systemic therapies include chemotherapy (if not previously used) and hormonal therapy.

### Minimally invasive interval debulking surgery in advanced… [^08e63dc7]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Minimally Invasive Interval Debulking Surgery in Advanced Ovarian Cancer ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview In women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with interval cytoreductive surgery and post-operative chemotherapy is an option. Several retrospective studies have demonstrated the feasibility of minimally invasive surgery in case of a good response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and prospective randomised trial is currently underway to demonstrate the non-inferiority of minimally invasive surgery compared to laparotomy in patients with an optimal response after 3–4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The aim of our study is to evaluate the feasibility of interval surgery after at least VI cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with a minimally invasive approach.

In women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with interval cytoreductive surgery and post-operative chemotherapy is an option. Four randomised trials have shown that survival rates after NACT are similar to those after primary cytoreductive surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. The use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy has increased significantly in recent years, and it has been shown that the determining prognostic factor is the achievement of an absent residual tumour at surgery. However, the optimal number of neoadjuvant chemotherapy cycles is not yet well defined. Several retrospective studies have evaluated the efficacy of interval debulking surgery after performing more than 4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In these studies, the percentage of patients undergoing > 4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy varied in a range of approximately 22% to 45%.

Currently, several randomised trials are ongoing, evaluating the optimal number of neoadjuvant chemotherapy cycles in terms of complete cytoreduction and survival.
- Stage IIIC or IV high-grade invasive epithelial ovarian carcinoma, primary peritoneal carcinoma, or fallopian tube carcinoma, or pathology consistent with high-grade Müllerian carcinoma.
- Partial or complete radiological response of abdominal cavity disease after at least 6 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
