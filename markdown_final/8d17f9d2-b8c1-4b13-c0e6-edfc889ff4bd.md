## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option best represents the most effective method to transmit a message of ethical behavior throughout an organization, according to COSO principles. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core COSO principle for ethical culture and tone at the top. Then, I should verify how each answer choice maps to COSO's control environment and communication concepts. Next, I will weigh the relative impact of modeling versus deterrence, pressure reduction, and competence frameworks. Finally, I will confirm the best-aligned choice and articulate why the alternatives, while important, are not the primary transmission mechanism for ethical messaging.

> Let me first confirm the COSO anchor point. COSO's Internal Control–Integrated Framework emphasizes that ethical values are communicated most powerfully through the tone at the top, with senior leadership demonstrating integrity and ethical behavior consistently across decisions and communications, thereby setting the standard for the entire organization [^notfound].

> Now, I will examine Option A, "Demonstrating appropriate behavior by example". This directly reflects tone at the top and modeling of ethical conduct, which COSO identifies as the principal way ethical expectations are transmitted and reinforced throughout the organization; employees interpret what is acceptable by watching what leaders actually do, not just what they say [^notfound].

> Next, I should review Option B, "Strengthening internal audit's ability to deter and report improper behavior". Wait, let me verify the role distinction here. Internal audit is a critical monitoring and deterrent function, but deterrence and reporting are downstream controls that reinforce ethics rather than transmit the ethical message itself; they support compliance but do not embody the primary communication mechanism for ethical norms [^notfound].

> I will now examine Option C, "Removing pressures to meet unrealistic targets, particularly for short-term results". Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — while reducing pressure mitigates a key driver of unethical behavior, it is an environmental fix rather than a direct method of communicating ethics; it shapes incentives but does not, by itself, convey what ethical behavior looks like or should be [^notfound].

> Let me consider Option D, "Specifying competence levels for every job and translating those levels to requisite knowledge and skills". I need to ensure I'm precise here. Competence frameworks support ethical performance by ensuring people have the capacity to act ethically, but they are enablers of capability, not the primary channel for transmitting ethical values across the organization [^notfound].

> Comparing these, I should double-check that modeling remains the most direct and impactful transmission method in COSO's view. Ethical culture is diffused through observable leadership behavior, which signals priorities, legitimizes norms, and provides a template for decision-making; the other options, while supportive, are indirect or instrumental rather than the principal communicative force for ethics [^notfound].

> Therefore, the most effective method to transmit a message of ethical behavior throughout an organization, according to COSO, is demonstrating appropriate behavior by example, Option A [^notfound].

---

The most effective method to transmit a message of ethical behavior throughout an organization, according to COSO, is **demonstrating appropriate behavior by example** (Option A). This is because ethical culture is shaped primarily by leadership modeling, which sets the tone at the top and influences employee behavior more than policies or controls alone [^notfound]. While internal audit, realistic targets, and competence frameworks are important, they support rather than replace the power of leadership example in embedding ethics.

---

## Analysis of options

### Option A: Demonstrating appropriate behavior by example

- **Tone at the top**: COSO emphasizes that ethical culture starts with leadership modeling desired behaviors, which employees observe and emulate [^notfound].
- **Influence on behavior**: Leaders' actions shape norms more than written policies, as employees infer acceptable conduct from what leaders actually do.
- **Sustainability**: Consistent modeling builds trust and reinforces ethical behavior across levels, making it self-perpetuating.

---

### Option B: Strengthening internal audit's ability to deter and report improper behavior

Internal audit is a **monitoring function** that detects and reports misconduct, supporting accountability. However, it is **reactive and limited** because it does not proactively transmit ethical values; it relies on leadership tone and culture to be effective [^notfound].

---

### Option C: Removing pressures to meet unrealistic targets, particularly for short-term results

Removing unrealistic targets **reduces incentives** for unethical behavior, but it is an **indirect approach** that does not actively communicate ethical standards or model desired conduct [^notfound].

---

### Option D: Specifying competence levels for every job and translating those levels to requisite knowledge and skills

Competence frameworks ensure employees have the **skills to act ethically**, but they are **foundational** and do not, by themselves, transmit ethical values or shape culture [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

COSO's framework clearly supports **leadership modeling** as the most effective way to transmit ethical behavior. Options B, C, and D are valuable supports, but they do not replace the primacy of demonstrating ethical conduct at the top. Therefore, **Option A is the best answer**.

Endocrine Society vitamin D guideline — scope and methods: The objective is to develop clinical guidelines for the use of vitamin D (cholecalciferol [vitamin D3] or ergocalciferol [vitamin D2]) to lower disease risk in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing. Background notes associations between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations and multiple conditions, while acknowledging that the optimal vitamin D intake and the role of testing for 25(OH)D for disease prevention remain uncertain. Methods state that the panel defined "empiric supplementation" as vitamin D intake that exceeds Dietary Reference Intakes and is implemented without 25(OH)D testing, used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess certainty and guide recommendations, and clarify that the process was not designed to replace current Dietary Reference Intakes for vitamin D.

The first part of this review focused on the skeletal aspects of vitamin D. This second part reviews some of the available evidence that vitamin D may have a physiological extraskeletal role beyond its traditional effect on the skeleton. This aspect has influenced the definition of vitamin D deficiency and what level of vitamin D should be regarded as optimal. The recognition of the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency has led to debate as to whether and how we should be treating asymptomatic individuals. This review discusses the potential extraskeletal effects of vitamin D, the definition of vitamin D deficiency and our thoughts on indications for measurement and treatment.

### Consensus and controversial aspects of vitamin D and COVID-19 [^112L9yHM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

This work aims to review and discuss controversial topics in the field of vitamin D, SARS-CoV-2 infection, and COVID-19.

Methods

The International Conferences "Controversies in Vitamin D" are a series of workshops that started in 2017 featuring international experts and leaders in vitamin D research and clinical practice. The fifth annual conference was held in Stresa, Italy, September 15 to 18, 2021.

Evidence

Before the event, participants reviewed available studies on their assigned topic, drafted a related abstract, and presented their findings at the time of the conference. Relevant literature that became available since was also discussed within the panel and updated accordingly.

Consensus

Before the event, the drafted abstracts had been merged to prepare a preliminary document. After the conference presentations, in-depth discussions in open sessions led to consensus. The document was subsequently modified according to discussions and up-to-date literature inclusion.

Conclusions

There is quite consistent evidence for an association between low 25 OH vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and poor COVID-19 outcomes, despite heterogeneous publications of variable quality. However, the low vitamin D status in COVID-19 patients might also reflect reverse causality. Vitamin D supplementation might have a positive role in COVID-19 prevention. The evidence supporting a beneficial effect of vitamin D treatment in decreasing the risk of COVID-19 complications is conflicting. Conclusive statements regarding the beneficial effect of vitamin D in this context await high-quality, randomized controlled trials.

Vitamin D 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) testing — In the general adult population younger than age 50 years, we suggest against routine 25(OH)D testing (2 | ⊕◯◯◯). Technical remarks state that, in this population, 25(OH)D levels that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials and that the panel suggests against routine screening for a 25(OH)D level to guide decision-making and against routine follow-up testing for 25(OH)D level to guide vitamin D dosing; this recommendation relates to generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia). Based on the panel's best estimates of treatment effects, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D are likely to be small at best and the anticipated undesirable effects are likely to be trivial, and panel members judged that empiric vitamin D would likely be acceptable to individuals in this age group, especially females with risk factors for developing osteoporosis.

### 'Vitamin D and cognition in older adults': updated international recommendations [^116Jzm4a]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypovitaminosis D, a condition that is highly prevalent in older adults aged 65 years and above, is associated with brain changes and dementia. Given the rapidly accumulating and complex contribution of the literature in the field of vitamin D and cognition, clear guidance is needed for researchers and clinicians.

Methods

International experts met at an invitational summit on 'Vitamin D and Cognition in Older Adults'. Based on previous reports and expert opinion, the task force focused on key questions relating to the role of vitamin D in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. Each question was discussed and voted using a Delphi-like approach.

Results

The experts reached an agreement that hypovitaminosis D increases the risk of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults and may alter the clinical presentation as a consequence of related comorbidities; however, at present, vitamin D level should not be used as a diagnostic or prognostic biomarker of Alzheimer's disease due to lack of specificity and insufficient evidence. This population should be screened for hypovitaminosis D because of its high prevalence and should receive supplementation, if necessary; but this advice was not specific to cognition. During the debate, the possibility of 'critical periods' during which vitamin D may have its greatest impact on the brain was addressed; whether hypovitaminosis D influences cognition actively through deleterious effects and/or passively by loss of neuroprotection was also considered.

Conclusions

The international task force agreed on five overarching principles related to vitamin D and cognition in older adults. Several areas of uncertainty remain, and it will be necessary to revise the proposed recommendations as new findings become available.

### Association of vitamin D status and other clinical characteristics with COVID-19 test results [^111TQZH1]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is vitamin D status, reflecting vitamin D levels and treatment, associated with test results for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?

Findings

In this cohort study of 489 patients who had a vitamin D level measured in the year before COVID-19 testing, the relative risk of testing positive for COVID-19 was 1.77 times greater for patients with likely deficient vitamin D status compared with patients with likely sufficient vitamin D status, a difference that was statistically significant.

Meaning

These findings appear to support a role of vitamin D status in COVID-19 risk; randomized clinical trials are needed to determine whether broad population interventions and interventions among groups at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 could reduce COVID-19 incidence.

Vitamin D — general adults younger than 50 years (testing): In the general adult population younger than age 50 years, we suggest against routine 25(OH)D testing. In this population, 25(OH)D levels that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials, and the panel suggests against (a) routine screening for a 25(OH)D level to guide decision-making (ie, vitamin D vs no vitamin D) and (b) routine follow-up testing for 25(OH)D level to guide vitamin D dosing; this recommendation relates to generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia).

### Ethical principles… [^1136xs6F]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Ethical Principles Ethical Principles Autonomyis defined by the right to self-determination and respects the individual's right to make informed decisions. Examples include:

- Employees viewed as valuable assets and part of the decision-making.
- Access to information about toxic exposures and their long-term consequences for safe decision-making.
- Complete and full disclosure of work-related harm.
- Worker notification, right to know, informed consent regarding health screening and surveillance activities.
- Privacy and confidentiality of health records and information. Nonmaleficenceis often referred to as the "no harm principle" that is inherent in professional standards, licensure, and codes of ethics and with an obligation not to place employees at risk of harm without protection. Examples include:

- Avoid placing workers in dangerous working conditions including technology with unknown/uncertain risks.
- Do not offer hazard pay for dangerous work which may create bias for doing the work.
- Aggressively address bullying, and physical and non-physical violence.
- Avoid placing an employee with known health considerations into harmful exposure work conditions.
- Develop positive leadership and policy practices to prevent unsupportive work organization behavior.
- Avoid creating too much stress where workers feel little or no control over the work, and where workers have poor interpersonal relationships with supervisors and co-workers, heavy workloads, long work hours, and poor wages. Beneficencerelates to mitigating or preventing harm and creating practices and environments that help others achieve their maximum health potential. Examples include:

- Team walk-throughs to identify potential hazards and stress drivers and make recommendations for hazard abatement.
- Health screenings that may identify early disease or disease interactive agents.
- Health protective programs like immunizations or a back injury prevention program.
- Management and workers' obligations for an effective safety culture like safety compliance and reporting unsafe practices and non-compliance. Justiceis directed toward treating employees equally and without discrimination with regards to their health status, sex, ethnicity, social aspects, and the like. Examples include:

- Non-punitive environment for incident/error reporting to improve work practice.
- Balancing costs and benefits and divided loyalties.
- Not singling out workers or work groups to perform unpleasant or hazardous duties. Previous Next.

### Vitamin D and SARS-CoV-2 virus / COVID-19 disease [^115tebds]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

In conclusion, we recommend appropriate vitamin D RCTs to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on COVID-19 infections. Until there is more robust scientific evidence for vitamin D, we strongly caution against the use of high vitamin D supplementation (greater than the upper limit of 4000 IU/day (100 µg/day)). Rather, we strongly endorse avoidance of vitamin D deficiencyin the population (as per the six points above) and complete adherence to government's advice worldwide on the prevention of the spread of COVID-19.

### Differential effects of vitamin D2 and D3 supplements on 25-hydroxyvitamin D level are dose, sex, and time dependent: a randomized controlled trial [^114hqviD]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D (D) supplements are indispensable for its world-wide deficiency. Controversy continues on ergocalciferol (D2) and cholecalciferol (D3) relative potency as well as on dosing-schedule and sex role in raising 25-hydroxy D (25(OH)D) level, the best indicator of D status.

Methods

We randomized 279 adults to daily D2, D3, D2/D3, or placebo; 2-weekly D2 or D3; or 4-weekly D2 or D3 (250,000 IU over/140 days). Randomization sequence, stratified by body-mass-index (BMI) and sex, was concealed from study coordinators and participants who were then blinded to capsules' content. D2, D3, 25(OH)D2, and 25(OH)D3 Serum levels were determined blindly on days 0,1,2,3,4,7,14, and 2-weekly thereafter by high performance liquid chromatography assay. The results of 269 participants were available for analysis. Primary endpoint was area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 25(OH)D (25(OH)D2 + 25(OH)D3) adjusted for sex, BMI, and baseline 25(OH)D level.

Results

Mean(SD) age was 33.0(8.5) year, 41% were males, and 85% completed follow-up. Baseline 25(OH)D level was 39.8(11.9) and increased by 3.3(11.6) and 28.6(16.3) nmol/L, in the placebo and active-treatment groups, respectively. AUC from day 0 to 140 (AUC 140) of 25(OH)D was 40% (D3 daily) to 55% (D3 2-weekly) higher with active-treatment than placebo (p < 0.001). 25(OH)D2 AUC 140 was higher in daily than 2-weekly (17%, p = 0.006) and 4-weekly (20%, p = 0.001) D2-treated groups. 25(OH)D3 AUC 140 was lower in daily than 2-weekly (11%, p = 0.002) and 4-weekly D3-treated groups (10%, p = 0.008). In D2-treated groups, there was 16.4 nmol/L decrease in 25(OH)D3 level that correlated (p < 0.001) with 25(OH)D2 level increase (r = 0.48) and baseline 25(OH)D level (r = 0.58), in one participant with measurable baseline 25(OH)D2 level, D3 caused a similar decrease in 25(OH)D2 level, while in the D2/D3-treated group, 25(OH)D3 level didn't increase. Incremental AUC from day 0 to 7 (AUC 7) of D3 and 25(OH)D3 in D3-treated groups were 118–243% higher and 31–39% lower, respectively, than incremental AUC 7 of D2 and 25(OH)D2 in D2-treated groups. Incremental AUC 7 of D3 and 25(OH)D3 in D3-treated groups and D2 and 25(OH)D2 in D2-treated groups were higher in females than males (55, 13, 64, and 28%, respectively). Baseline 25(OH)D level predicted response to D2 and D3 (p < 0.001), whereas, BMI was significant predictor only for early response to D2.

Conclusions

Effects of D2 and D3 supplements on 25 (OH)D level may be dosing-schedule and sex-dependent. D2-associated reduction in 25(OH)D3 level may be related to total 25(OH)D level rather than being D2-specific. D2 may be 25-hydroxylated faster than D3.

### Vitamin D supplementation for prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus: to D or not to D? [^111Dxkqk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Answers to clinically important questions are rarely dichotomous ("positive" or "negative"), and a recommendation of whether "to D or not to D" should be made based on the best available data from both observational studies and clinical trials. Results from trials are congruent with a large body of evidence from observational studies indicating that vitamin D has a role in modulating diabetes risk. We are awaiting the full publication of the DPVD study and results from individual participant data meta-analyses. Even if the risk reduction with vitamin D supplementation may appear relatively small, when applied in the expanding prediabetes population, it can have important public health implications.

Vitamin D — adults aged 50 to 74 years (supplementation): In the general population aged 50 to 74 years, we suggest against routine vitamin D supplementation beyond the recommended Dietary Reference Intake for this population. This recommendation relates to empiric vitamin D supplementation that exceeds the DRIs established by the IOM, and adults in this age group should follow the Recommended Daily Allowance established by the IOM (600 IU [15 μg] daily for those aged 50 to 70 years; 800 IU [20 μg] daily for those older than 70 years).

Vitamin D intake targets and testing policy note that "The panel assumed that all should follow the Recommended Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI)", specifying "The Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) in the DRI is 600 IU (15 μg) for persons aged 1–70 years and 800 IU (20 μg) for persons older than 70 years", and in pregnancy "600 IU (15 μg)". For people "older than 50 years" with an indication for treatment, "the panel suggests supplementation via daily administration of vitamin D, rather than intermittent high doses". The panel also "suggests against routine 25-hydroxyvitamin D testing for generally healthy individuals who do not otherwise have established indications", citing feasibility concerns that "access to accurate 25(OH)D testing is variable across the globe, and an approach requiring such testing may not be feasible in some settings". The scope further notes, "this guideline does not address individuals with underlying conditions that substantially alter vitamin D physiology".

### High-dose vitamin D in clinically isolated syndrome typical of multiple sclerosis: the D-lay MS randomized clinical trial [^115DxKei]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for multiple sclerosis (MS) and is associated with the risk of disease activity, but data on the benefits of supplementation are conflicting.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of high-dose cholecalciferol as monotherapy in reducing disease activity in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) typical for MS.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The D-Lay MS trial was a parallel, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial in 36 MS centers in France. Patients were enrolled from July 2013 to December 2020 (final follow-up on January 18, 2023). Untreated patients with CIS aged 18 to 55 years with CIS duration less than 90 days, serum vitamin D concentration less than 100 nmol/L, and diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) meeting 2010 criteria for dissemination in space or 2 or more lesions and presence of oligoclonal bands were recruited.

Intervention

Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive oral cholecalciferol 100 000 IU (n = 163) or placebo (n = 153) every 2 weeks for 24 months.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome measure was disease activity, defined as occurrence of a relapse and/or MRI activity (new and/or contrast-enhancing lesions) over 24 months of follow-up, also analyzed as separate secondary outcomes.

Results

Of the 316 participants enrolled and randomized (median [IQR] age, 34 [28–42] years; 70% women), the primary analysis included 303 patients (95.9%) who took at least 1 dose of the study drug and 288 (91.1%) ultimately completed the 24-month trial. Disease activity was observed in 94 patients (60.3%) in the vitamin D group and 109 patients (74.1%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66 [95% CI, 0.50–0.87]; P = 0.004), and median time to disease activity was longer in the vitamin D group (432 vs 224 days; log-rank P = 0.003). All 3 secondary MRI outcomes reported significant differences favoring the vitamin D group vs the placebo group: MRI activity (89 patients [57.1%] vs 96 patients [65.3%]; HR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.53–0.95]; P = 0.02), new lesions (72 patients [46.2%] vs 87 patients [59.2%]; HR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.44–0.84]; P = 0.003), and contrast-enhancing lesions (29 patients [18.6%] vs 50 patients [34.0%]; HR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.30–0.75]; P = 0.001). All 10 secondary clinical outcomes showed no significant difference, including relapse, which occurred in 28 patients (17.9%) in the vitamin D group vs 32 (21.8%) in the placebo group (HR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.42–1.16]; P = 0.16). Results were similar in a subset of 247 patients meeting updated 2017 diagnostic criteria for relapsing-remitting MS at treatment initiation. Severe adverse events occurred in 17 patients in the vitamin D group and 13 in the placebo group, none of which were related to cholecalciferol.

Conclusions and Relevance

Oral cholecalciferol 100 000 IU every 2 weeks significantly reduced disease activity in CIS and early relapsing-remitting MS. These results warrant further investigation, including the potential role of pulse high-dose vitamin D as add-on therapy.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1164Mjig]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — adults with obesity: For screening of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), in adults with obesity, we suggest against routine screening for 25(OH)D levels (2 | ⊕⊕⚪⚪). Technical remarks note that 25(OH)D thresholds that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials and that this applies to generally healthy adults with obesity who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia). The evidence review identified no trials testing a screen-and-treat strategy for low 25(OH)D in people with obesity that improved prespecified outcomes.

### Vitamin D supplementation for prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus: to D or not to D? [^114kvSAv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The Vitamin D and Type 2 Diabetes trial.

The Vitamin D and Type 2 Diabetes (D2d) study was a 22-site trial that took place from October 2013 through December 2018 in the United States. The study randomly assigned 2423 adults (mean age 60 years, mean BMI 32 kg/m 2) who met at least 2 of 3 glycemic criteria for prediabetes (FG 100–125 mg/dL; 2hG 140–199 mg/dL; HbA1c 5.7–6.4%) to treatment with 4000 IU of vitamin D 3 daily or placebo. The primary outcome was time-to-incident diabetes based on annual glycemic testing through FG, HbA1c and 2hG, and semiannually with FG and HbA1c. The trial design was event-driven, with a target number of diabetes events of 508. Mean baseline serum 25(OH)D level was 28 ng/mL (69 nmol/L) and 78% of participants had a level ≥ 20 ng/mL (49 nmol/L) (Table 3). During follow-up, mean serum 25(OH)D level in the vitamin D group rose to 54 ng/mL compared with 29 ng/mL in the placebo group. After a median follow-up of 2.5 years, 616 diabetes events had occurred: 293 in the vitamin D group and 323 in the placebo group (9.4 events vs 10.7 events per 100 person-years, respectively). In the ITT analysis, the risk of diabetes was not significantly lower in the vitamin D group (hazard ratio 0.88; 95% CI: 0.75–1.04).

In each of these 3 studies, protocol-specified adverse events of interest (hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and nephrolithiasis) were rare, and there were no significant differences between vitamin D and placebo.

Recommendation 7 — general population aged 75 years and older: In the general population aged 75 years and older, we suggest against routine testing for 25(OH)D levels. In this population, 25(OH)D thresholds that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials, and the panel suggests against (a) routine screening for a 25(OH)D level to guide decision-making (ie, vitamin D vs no vitamin D) and (b) routine follow-up testing for 25(OH)D level to guide vitamin D dosing. This recommendation relates to generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia).

### Exploring vitamin D metabolism and function in cancer [^113pqMPU]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Because the numerous epidemiological and experimental data indicate the beneficial role of vitamin D in the prevention and treatment of several types of cancers, clinical use of calcitriol or vitamin D analogs has been investigated. However, hypercalcemia, the major toxic effect of vitamin D, has strongly limited its clinical applications. Moreover, accumulating data suggest that cancer cells employ several mechanisms that reduce cellular calcitriol levels, as well as diminish its function to protect themselves from the antitumorigenic effects of vitamin D. Thus, understanding how vitamin D metabolism and signaling are dysregulated in cancer will help develop efficient therapeutic strategies to overcome such limitations of using vitamin D or its analogs for clinical purpose.

In this review, we provide an overview of vitamin D metabolic pathways and summarize antitumorigenic functions and mechanisms of vitamin D. In addition, we discuss how vitamin D metabolism and function are dysregulated in cancer to promote resistance to the antitumorigenic effect of vitamin D. Finally, we discuss future directions to overcome the limitations of and improve vitamin D-based cancer therapy.

### Association of vitamin D status and other clinical characteristics with COVID-19 test results [^116HAtWj]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this study suggest a role of vitamin D status, based on deficiency of levels and treatment, in risk of COVID-19 infection. Randomized clinical trials of interventions to reduce vitamin D deficiency are needed to determine if those interventions could reduce COVID-19 incidence, including both broad population interventions and interventions among groups at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency and/or COVID-19.

### Vitamin D supplementation and prevention of type 2 diabetes [^112D3B5M]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Observational studies support an association between a low blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D level and the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, whether vitamin D supplementation lowers the risk of diabetes is unknown.

Methods

We randomly assigned adults who met at least two of three glycemic criteria for prediabetes (fasting plasma glucose level, 100 to 125 mg per deciliter; plasma glucose level 2 hours after a 75-g oral glucose load, 140 to 199 mg per deciliter; and glycated hemoglobin level, 5.7 to 6.4%) and no diagnostic criteria for diabetes to receive 4000 IU per day of vitamin D 3 or placebo, regardless of the baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level. The primary outcome in this time-to-event analysis was new-onset diabetes, and the trial design was event-driven, with a target number of diabetes events of 508.

Results

A total of 2423 participants underwent randomization (1211 to the vitamin D group and 1212 to the placebo group). By month 24, the mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level in the vitamin D group was 54.3 ng per milliliter (from 27.7 ng per milliliter at baseline), as compared with 28.8 ng per milliliter in the placebo group (from 28.2 ng per milliliter at baseline). After a median follow-up of 2.5 years, the primary outcome of diabetes occurred in 293 participants in the vitamin D group and 323 in the placebo group (9.39 and 10.66 events per 100 person-years, respectively). The hazard ratio for vitamin D as compared with placebo was 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.75 to 1.04; P = 0.12). The incidence of adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups.

Conclusions

Among persons at high risk for type 2 diabetes not selected for vitamin D insufficiency, vitamin D 3 supplementation at a dose of 4000 IU per day did not result in a significantly lower risk of diabetes than placebo.

### A test in context: D-dimer [^113kRJDw]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

D-dimer is a soluble fibrin degradation product that results from ordered breakdown of thrombi by the fibrinolytic system. Numerous studies have shown that D-dimer serves as a valuable marker of activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Consequently, D-dimer has been extensively investigated for the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and is used routinely for this indication. In addition, D-dimer has been evaluated for determining the optimal duration of anticoagulation in VTE patients, for diagnosing and monitoring disseminated intravascular coagulation, and as an aid in the identification of medical patients at high risk for VTE. Thus, quantification of D-dimer levels serves an important role in guiding therapy. This review: 1) describes how D-dimer is generated; 2) reviews the assays used for its detection; and 3) discusses the role of D-dimer determination in these various conditions.

### How we manage a high D-dimer [^1144PcsQ]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Proposed management of ambulatory individuals with high D-dimer

While there is little doubt of the role of D-dimer in the diagnostic workup of patients affected by acute illnesses such as VTE, DIC and sepsis (Table 1), a challenge is represented by the management of ambulatory individuals characterized by the detection of high D-dimer levels but no evidence of thrombosis. This issue has received greater attention given the generalized and indiscriminate dispensation of D-dimer testing during and following the COVID-19 pandemic. When an ostensibly healthy and asymptomatic person is referred for persistently high D-dimer, they should first be reassured by explaining all the possible reasons other than disease that may underly this abnormality. On the other hand, an abnormal D-dimer should not be overlooked in otherwise asymptomatic subjects. Thus, they should have access to differential diagnostic procedures, and all possible conditions associated with increased D-dimer should be taken into consideration in the process.

How much vitamin D should people get?

A very important first step would be to ensure that all people get at least as much vitamin D with a dietary supplement as recommended for the various countries. The recommended daily amount is 400 IU in the UK. US recommendations are 600 IU for adults up to 70 years of age, and 800 IU for people over the age of 70. Individuals with known risk factors need more, but current recommendations are silent on their specific needs. Higher intakes are likely safe as long as the amounts are well under 4000 IU per day.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^117LzzKb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (daily requirements), ES 2011 guidelines recommend to consider keeping the maintenance tolerable upper limits of vitamin D (not exceeding without medical supervision) at 1,000 IU/day in infants up to 6 months, 1,500 IU/day in infants from 6 months to 1 year, at least 2500 IU/day in 1–3 years old children, 3,000 IU/day in 4–8 years old children, and 4,000 IU/day in > 8 years old children. Recognize that higher levels of 2,000 IU/day in 0–1 year old children, 4,000 IU/day in 1–18 years old children, and 10,000 IU/day may be required to correct vitamin D deficiency.

### Early high-dose vitamin dfor critically ill, vitamin D-deficient patients [^114Di1YQ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Vitamin D deficiency is a common, potentially reversible contributor to morbidity and mortality among critically ill patients. The potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation in acute critical illness require further study.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial of early vitamin D 3 supplementation in critically ill, vitamin D-deficient patients who were at high risk for death. Randomization occurred within 12 hours after the decision to admit the patient to an intensive care unit. Eligible patients received a single enteral dose of 540,000 IU of vitamin D 3 or matched placebo. The primary end point was 90-day all-cause, all-location mortality.

Results

A total of 1360 patients were found to be vitamin D-deficient during point-of-care screening and underwent randomization. Of these patients, 1078 had baseline vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D level, < 20 ng per milliliter [50 nmol per liter]) confirmed by subsequent testing and were included in the primary analysis population. The mean day 3 level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D was 46.9 ± 23.2 ng per milliliter (117 ± 58 nmol per liter) in the vitamin D group and 11.4 ± 5.6 ng per milliliter (28 ± 14 nmol per liter) in the placebo group (difference, 35.5 ng per milliliter; 95% confidence interval [CI] 31.5 to 39.6). The 90-day mortality was 23.5% in the vitamin D group (125 of 531 patients) and 20.6% in the placebo group (109 of 528 patients) (difference, 2.9 percentage points; 95% CI, -2.1 to 7.9; P = 0.26). There were no clinically important differences between the groups with respect to secondary clinical, physiological, or safety end points. The severity of vitamin D deficiency at baseline did not affect the association between the treatment assignment and mortality.

Conclusions

Early administration of high-dose enteral vitamin D 3 did not provide an advantage over placebo with respect to 90-day mortality or other, nonfatal outcomes among critically ill, vitamin D-deficient patients.

### Vitamin D supplementation and major cardiovascular events: D-health randomised controlled trial [^111BQGg2]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study D-Health was published by Bridie Thompson and colleagues in 2023 in the journal BMJ. This study is related to the following diseases: ST-elevation myocardial infarction, Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and Acute ischemic stroke. In the D-Health study, the trial question was: what is the role of vitamin D supplementation in older adults? In the D-Health study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the D-Health study, the population was: 21302 patients (9777 female, 11525 male). The inclusion criteria were adult participants aged 60–84 years. The key exclusion criteria were self-reported hypercalcemia; hyperparathyroidism; kidney stones; osteomalacia; sarcoidosis; receipt of > 500 IU/day supplemental vitamin D; or unable to give consent because of language or cognitive impairment. In the D-Health study, the interventions were: n = 10658 vitamin D (oral dose of 60,000 IU/month for 5 years) n = 10644 placebo (matching oral placebo for 5 years). In the D-Health study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in major cardiovascular event (6% vs. 6.6%; HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.01). In the D-Health study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in myocardial infarction (1.8% vs. 2.2%; HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.98) No significant difference in coronary revascularization (3.9% vs. 4.3%; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01) No significant difference in stroke (1.6% vs. 1.6%; HR 0.99, 99% CI 0.8 to 1.23). In the D-Health study, the conclusion was: in adult participants aged 60–84 years, vitamin D was not superior to placebo with respect to major cardiovascular event.

### Maternal vitamin D ₃ supplementation at 50 μ g / D protects against low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in infants at 8 wk of age: a randomized controlled trial of 3 doses of vitamin D beginning in gestation and continued in lactation [^114P9uS9]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D supplementation is recommended for breastfed infants. Maternal supplementation beginning in gestation is a potential alternative, but its efficacy in maintaining infant 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration after birth is unknown.

Objectives

We determined the effect of 3 doses of maternal vitamin D supplementation beginning in gestation and continued in lactation on infant serum 25(OH)D and compared the prevalence of infant serum 25(OH)D cutoffs (> 30, > 40, > 50, and > 75 nmol/L) by dose at 8 wk of age.

Design

Pregnant women (n = 226) were randomly allocated to receive 10, 25, or 50 μg vitamin D₃/d from 13 to 24 wk of gestation until 8 wk postpartum, with no infant supplementation. Mother and infant blood was collected at 8 wk postpartum.

Results

At 8 wk postpartum, mean [nmol/L (95% CI)] infant 25(OH)D at 8 wk was higher in the 50-μg/d [75 (67, 83)] than in the 25-μg/d [52 (45, 58)] or 10-μg/d [45 (38, 52)] vitamin D groups (P < 0.05). Fewer infants born to mothers in the 50-μg/d group had a 25(OH)D concentration < 30 nmol/L (indicative of deficiency) than infants in the 25- and 10-μg/d groups, respectively (2% compared with 16% and 43%; P < 0.05). Fewer than 15% of infants in the 10- or 25-μg/d groups achieved a 25(OH)D concentration > 75 nmol/L compared with 44% in the 50-μg/d group (P < 0.05). Almost all infants (∼98%, n = 44) born to mothers in the 50-μg/d group achieved a 25(OH)D concentration > 30 nmol/L. At 8 wk postpartum, mean maternal 25(OH)D concentration was higher in the 50-μg/d [88 (84, 91)] than in the 25-μg/d [78 (74, 81)] or 10-μg/d [69 (66, 73)] groups (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Maternal supplementation beginning in gestation with 50 μg vitamin D₃/d protects 98% of unsupplemented breastfed infants against 25(OH)D deficiency (< 30 nmol/L) to at least 8 wk, whereas 10 or 25 μg vitamin D/d protects only 57% and 84% of infants, respectively.

### Differential effects of oral boluses of vitamin D2 vs vitamin D3 on vitamin D metabolism: a randomized controlled trial [^1111rS7K]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 have been hypothesized to exert differential effects on vitamin D metabolism.

Objective

To compare the influence of administering vitamin D2 vs vitamin D3 on metabolism of vitamin D3.

Methods

We measured baseline and 4-month serum concentrations of vitamin D3, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3], 25-hydroxyvitamin D2, 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [24R,25(OH)2D3], 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1α,25(OH)2D3], and 4β,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [4β,25(OH)2D3] in 52 adults randomized to receive a total of four oral bolus doses of 2.5 mg vitamin D2 (n = 28) or vitamin D3 (n = 24) over four months. Metabolite-to-parent compound ratios were calculated to estimate hydroxylase activity. Pairwise before vs after comparisons were made to evaluate effects of vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 on metabolism of vitamin D. Mean postsupplementation metabolite-to-parent ratios were then compared between groups.

Results

Vitamin D2 was less effective than vitamin D3 in elevating total serum 25(OH)D concentration. Vitamin D2 suppressed mean four-month serum concentrations of 25(OH)D3, 24R,25(OH)2D3, 1α,25(OH)2D3, and 4β,25(OH)2D3 and mean ratios of 25(OH)D3 to D3 and 1α,25(OH)2D3 to 25(OH)D3, while increasing the mean ratio of 24R,25(OH)2D3 to 25(OH)D3. Vitamin D3 increased mean four-month serum concentrations of 25(OH)D3, 24R,25(OH)2D3, 1α,25(OH)2D3, and 4β,25(OH)2D3 and the mean ratio of 24R,25(OH)2D3 to 25(OH)D3. Participants receiving vitamin D2 had lower mean postsupplementation ratios of 25(OH)D3 to vitamin D3 and 1α,25(OH)2D3 to 25(OH)D3 than those receiving vitamin D3. Mean postsupplementation ratios of 24R,25(OH)2D3 to 25(OH)D3 and 4β,25(OH)2D3 to 25(OH)D3 did not differ between groups.

Conclusions

Bolus-dose vitamin D2 is less effective than bolus-dose vitamin D3 in elevating total serum 25(OH)D concentration. Administration of vitamin D2 reduces 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D3 and 1-α hydroxylation of 25(OH)D3, while increasing 24R-hydroxylation of 25(OH)D3.

The study D-CARE (health system-based care) was published by David B Reuben and colleagues in 2025 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Dementia. In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the trial question was: what is the role of health system-based care in community-dwelling persons living with dementia? In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the population was: 1160 patients (688 female, 472 male). The inclusion criteria were community-dwelling persons living with dementia and their caregivers. The key exclusion criteria were nursing home resident; hospice care; paid caregiver not a relative or close friend; cognitively impaired caregiver; unwilling or unable to provide self-reported outcome measures for 18 months. In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the interventions were: n = 1016 health system-based care (care provided by an advanced practice dementia care specialist) n = 144 usual care (care corresponding to traditional care). In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in least squares means for Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire severity score (9.8 points vs. 10.1 points; MD -0.33, 95% CI -1.32 to 0.67). In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in least squares means for Modified Caregiver Strain Index (10.7 points vs. 10.6 points; MD 0.14, 95% CI -0.7 to 0.99) No significant difference in PHQ-8 score (4.7 points vs. 4.69 points; MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.53 to 0.55) Significant increase in Caregiver Self-Efficacy score (15.1 points vs. 14.4 points; MD 0.7, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.14). In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in death and hospitalizations. In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the conclusion was: in community-dwelling persons living with dementia and their caregivers, health system-based care was not superior to usual care with respect to least squares means for Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire severity score.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111crY8T]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — evidence for diabetes prevention in adults with prediabetes: The commissioned systematic review included 11 RCTs on new-onset diabetes in adults with prediabetes (total of 5316 participants), conducted in India (n = 4), Iran (n = 1), Greece (n = 1), Norway (n = 1), Japan (n = 1), and the United States (n = 3). In pooled analyses, vitamin D reduced the risk of developing diabetes (RR 0.90 [95% CI, 0.81–1.00]), and including the DPVD trial produced similar results (RR 0.90 [95% CI, 0.81–0.99]). An individual participant data meta-analysis of the 3 vitamin D trials (total of 4190 participants) showed a 15% reduction in new-onset diabetes in adults with prediabetes randomized to vitamin D compared to placebo (HR 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75–0.96]). The beneficial effect of vitamin D on diabetes risk was described as consistent across subgroups by risk of bias or vitamin D dosage.

Abstract

Context

Vitamin D 2 and vitamin D 3 have been hypothesized to exert differential effects on vitamin D metabolism.

Objective

To compare the influence of administering vitamin D 2 vs vitamin D 3 on metabolism of vitamin D 3.

Methods

We measured baseline and 4-month serum concentrations of vitamin D 3, 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 [25(OH)D 3], 25-hydroxyvitamin D 2, 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 [24R,25(OH) 2 D 3], 1 α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 [1 α,25(OH) 2 D 3], and 4 β,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 [4 β,25(OH) 2 D 3] in 52 adults randomized to receive a total of four oral bolus doses of 2.5 mg vitamin D 2 (n = 28) or vitamin D 3 (n = 24) over four months. Metabolite-to-parent compound ratios were calculated to estimate hydroxylase activity. Pairwise before vs after comparisons were made to evaluate effects of vitamin D 2 and vitamin D 3 on metabolism of vitamin D. Mean postsupplementation metabolite-to-parent ratios were then compared between groups.

Results

Vitamin D 2 was less effective than vitamin D 3 in elevating total serum 25(OH)D concentration. Vitamin D 2 suppressed mean four-month serum concentrations of 25(OH)D 3, 24R,25(OH) 2 D 3, 1 α,25(OH) 2 D 3, and 4 β,25(OH) 2 D 3 and mean ratios of 25(OH)D 3 to D 3 and 1 α,25(OH) 2 D 3 to 25(OH)D 3, while increasing the mean ratio of 24R,25(OH) 2 D 3 to 25(OH)D 3. Vitamin D 3 increased mean four-month serum concentrations of 25(OH)D 3, 24R,25(OH) 2 D 3, 1 α,25(OH) 2 D 3, and 4 β,25(OH) 2 D 3 and the mean ratio of 24R,25(OH) 2 D 3 to 25(OH)D 3. Participants receiving vitamin D 2 had lower mean postsupplementation ratios of 25(OH)D 3 to vitamin D 3 and 1 α,25(OH) 2 D 3 to 25(OH)D 3 than those receiving vitamin D 3. Mean postsupplementation ratios of 24R,25(OH) 2 D 3 to 25(OH)D 3 and 4 β,25(OH) 2 D 3 to 25(OH)D 3 did not differ between groups.

Conclusions

Bolus-dose vitamin D 2 is less effective than bolus-dose vitamin D 3 in elevating total serum 25(OH)D concentration. Administration of vitamin D 2 reduces 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D 3 and 1- α hydroxylation of 25(OH)D 3, while increasing 24R-hydroxylation of 25(OH)D 3.

The inclusion criteria were adults at high risk for T2DM not selected for vitamin D insufficiency. The key exclusion criteria were any glycemic criterion in the diabetes range affecting the glycated hemoglobin level; use of diabetes or weight-loss medications; use of supplements containing vitamin D at a dose > 1,000 IU/day or calcium at a dose > 600 mg/day. In the D2d study, the interventions were: n = 1211 vitamin D supplementation (at a dose of 4,000 IU/day of vitamin D3 supplementation) n = 1212 placebo (matching placebo). In the D2d study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in the incidence of new-onset diabetes (9.39 events /100 py vs. 10.66 events /100 py; HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.04). In the D2d study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in hypercalcemia, fasting urine calcium/creatinine ratio > 0.375, low eGFR, nephrolithiasis. In the D2d study, the conclusion was: in adults at high risk for T2DM not selected for vitamin D insufficiency, vitamin D supplementation was not superior to placebo with respect to the incidence of new-onset diabetes.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^111pqjCu]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Evidence grading system — guideline definitions for evidence-based statements define four statement types with clinician implications. For a strong recommendation, The Expert Panel believes that the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms and that the quality of the supporting evidence is excellent (Grade A or B). In some clearly defined circumstances, strong recommendations may be made on the basis of lesser evidence (Grade C or D) when high-quality evidence is impossible to obtain and when the anticipated benefits clearly outweigh the harms. Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. For a recommendation, The Expert Panel believes that the benefits exceed the harms but that the quality of the evidence is not as strong (Grade B or C). In some clearly defined circumstances, recommendations may be made on the basis of lesser evidence (Grade D) when high-quality evidence is impossible to obtain and when the anticipated benefits clearly outweigh the harms. Clinicians should generally follow a recommendation but remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. For optional statements, Either the quality of the evidence that exists is suspect (Grade D) or well-performed studies (Grade A, B, or C) show little clear advantage to one approach versus another, and Clinicians should be flexible in their decision-making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set boundaries on alternatives; patient and family preference should have a substantial influencing role. For no recommendation, There is both a lack of pertinent evidence (Grade D) and an unclear balance between benefits and harms, and Clinicians should not be constrained in their decision-making and should be alert to newly published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit versus harm; patient and family preferences should have a substantial influencing role.

### Health system, community-based, or usual dementia care for persons with dementia and caregivers: the D-CARE randomized clinical trial [^112wHnfz]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study D-CARE (community-based care) was published by David B Reuben and colleagues in 2025 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Dementia. In the D-CARE (community-based care) study, the trial question was: what is the role of community-based care in community-dwelling persons living with dementia? In the D-CARE (community-based care) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the D-CARE (community-based care) study, the population was: 1160 patients (660 female, 500 male). The inclusion criteria were community-dwelling persons living with dementia and their caregivers. The key exclusion criteria were nursing home resident; hospice care; paid caregiver not a relative or close friend; cognitively impaired caregiver; unwilling or unable to provide self-reported outcome measures for 18 months. In the D-CARE (community-based care) study, the interventions were: n = 1016 community-based care (care provided by a social worker, nurse, or licensed therapist care consultant) n = 144 usual care (care corresponding to traditional care). In the D-CARE (community-based care) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in least squares means for Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire severity score (9.5 points vs. 10.1 points; MD -0.62, 95% CI -1.61 to 0.37). In the D-CARE (community-based care) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in least squares means for Modified Caregiver Strain Index (10.5 points vs. 10.6 points; MD -0.1, 95% CI -0.94 to 0.74) No significant difference in PHQ-8 score (4.42 points vs. 4.69 points; MD -0.27, 95% CI -0.81 to 0.27) Significant increase in Caregiver Self-Efficacy score (15.2 points vs. 14.4 points; MD 0.85, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.29). In the D-CARE (community-based care) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in death and hospitalizations. In the D-CARE (community-based care) study, the conclusion was: in community-dwelling persons living with dementia and their caregivers, community-based care was not superior to usual care with respect to least squares means for Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire severity score.

### Evidences for a protective role of vitamin D in COVID-19 [^114TFkza]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients hospitalised with COVID-19 should have baseline serum 25(OH)D concentrations measured and must be supplemented at least to a level ≥ 30 ng/mL (optimal 40–60), especially when the baseline level is < 10 ng/mL and such deficiency is significantly more present in male patients.

In conclusion, we might suggest in COVID-19 patients with 25(OH)D serum levels under 20 ng/mL that the usual recommended dose for correction of deficiency should be 6000–7000 oral IU/day for the first 6–8 weeks. For maintenance, the dose should varies from 2000 to 3000 oral IU/day depending on the age and clinical condition of the patient up to achieve the suggested concentrations.

### A conservative dialysis strategy and kidney function recovery in dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury: the liberation from acute dialysis (LIBERATE-D) randomized clinical trial [^113MY6fA]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

For patients with dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury, persistent need for dialysis is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, high health care use, and poor quality of life.

Objective

To test the effect of a conservative dialysis strategy on recovery of kidney function.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This multicenter, unblinded, randomized superiority trial enrolled participants with dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury who had a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate greater than 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, had already initiated kidney replacement therapy, and were hemodynamically stable, with planned intermittent hemodialysis between January 23, 2020, and March 10, 2025, at 4 clinical sites in the United States. Of 909 patients assessed for eligibility, 221 were randomized and 220 received the allocated intervention. The date of last follow-up was June 10, 2025.

Intervention

With the conservative dialysis strategy, participants received dialysis only when specific metabolic or clinical indications were met. Participants in the conventional dialysis group received dialysis 3 times per week until urine output or creatinine clearance criteria were met.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary study end point was unadjusted kidney function recovery at hospital discharge, defined as being alive and not receiving dialysis, with at least 14 consecutive days without dialysis (including after discharge). Two prespecified key secondary end points were the number of dialysis sessions per week and the number of dialysis-free days to day 28.

Results

The mean age of participants was 56 years (SD, 16 years). A total of 148 of 220 participants (67%) were male, 28 (13%) were Black, and 133 (60%) were White. Mean baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate was 64.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 (SD, 30.9 mL/min/1.73 m2). Participants had started kidney replacement therapy a median of 9 days (IQR, 5–18.5 days) before randomization. In the conservative dialysis intervention group, 70 of 109 participants (64%) achieved kidney function recovery at hospital discharge vs 55 of 109 participants (50%) in the conventional dialysis control group (difference, 13.8% [95% CI, 0.8%-26.8%; P = 0.04]; unadjusted odds ratio, 1.76 [95% CI, 1.02–3.03; P = 0.04]; after prespecified adjustment: odds ratio, 1.56 [95% CI, 0.86–2.84; P = 0.15]). Participants in the conservative dialysis group received fewer dialysis sessions per week (median, 1.8 [IQR, 0–2.6] vs 3.1 [IQR, 2.6–3.5]; difference, -1.4 [95% CI, -1.8 to -1.0]) and recovered earlier (21 [IQR, 0–28] vs 5 [IQR, 0–21] consecutive dialysis-free days to day 28; difference, 16 days [95% CI, 5–27]). Dialysis-associated hypotension occurred less frequently in the conservative dialysis group (69 vs 97 events).

Conclusions and Relevance

A conservative dialysis strategy in dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury resulted in a shorter time to and higher rates of recovery of kidney function in the unadjusted analysis. Given uncertainty regarding the estimated effect size, this approach should be tested in a larger study population.

Trial Registration

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04218370.

### Vitamin D deficiency is associated with COVID-19 positivity and severity of the disease [^116UdpYE]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

The present study examined the relationship between polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test positivity and clinical outcomes of vitamin D levels measured within the 6 months before the PCR test in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-positive patients. In this retrospective cohort study, COVID-19 (227) and non-COVID-19 patients (260) were divided into four groups according to their vitamin D levels: Group I (0-10ng/ml), Group II (10-20ng/ml), Group III (20-30ng/ml), and Group IV (vitamin D > 30ng/ml). Laboratory test results and the radiological findings were evaluated. In addition, for comparative purposes, medical records of 1200 patients who had a hospital visit in the November 1, 2019-November 1, 2020 period for complaints due to reasons not related to COVID-19 were investigated for the availability of vitamin D measurements. This search yielded 260 patients with tested vitamin D levels. Vitamin D levels were below 30ng/ml in 94.27% of 227 COVID-19-positive patients (average age, 46.32 ± 1.24 years [range, 20–80 years] and 56.54% women) while 93.07% of 260 non-COVID-19 patients (average age, 44.63 ± 1.30 years [range, 18–75 years] and 59.50% women) had vitamin D levels below 30ng/ml. Nevertheless, very severe vitamin D deficiency (< 10ng/ml) was considerably more common in COVID-19 patients (44%) (average age, 44.15 ± 1.89 years [range, 23–80 years] and 57.57% women) than in non-COVID-19 ones (31%) (average age, 46.50 ± 2.21 years [range, 20–75 years] and 62.5% women). Among COVID-19-positive patients, the group with vitamin D levels of > 30ng/ml had significantly lower D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, number levels, number of affected lung segments and shorter hospital stays. No difference was found among the groups in terms of age and gender distribution. Elevated vitamin D levels could decrease COVID-19 PCR positivity, D-dime and CRP levels and the number of affected lung segments in COVID-19-positive patients, thereby shortening the duration of hospital stays and alleviating the intensity of COVID-19.

### Differential effects of oral boluses of vitamin D2 vs vitamin D3 on vitamin D metabolism: a randomized controlled trial [^115HV2PP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first investigation to evaluate the influence of vitamin D 2 on circulating concentrations of parent vitamin D 3 and its dihydroxylated metabolite 4 β,25(OH) 2 D 3 in addition to serum concentrations of 25(OH)D 2 and 25(OH)D 3. We found that administration of vitamin D 2 exerted a greater inhibitory effect than administration of vitamin D 3 on mean ratios of 25(OH)D 3 to D 3 and 1 α,25(OH) 2 D 3 to 25(OH)D 3 in the circulation. We also observed that vitamin D 2 and vitamin D 3 increased the mean 24R,25(OH) 2 D 3 -to-25(OH)D 3 ratio to a similar extent, and that neither form of vitamin D had a statistically significant effect on the mean serum 4 β,25(OH) 2 D 3 -to-25(OH)D 3 ratio. By contrast with findings of a recently published study, we found that administration of vitamin D 3 did not suppress serum concentrations of 25(OH)D 2, nor did it influence mean serum 25(OH)D 2 -to-vitamin D 2 ratio. Administration of vitamin D 2 resulted in an increase in the mean 25(OH)D 2 -to-D 2 ratio.

指南第一版发布后，尚没有DCD儿童书写干预的论文发表，因此第一版这方面的内容暂时不变。仅一项病例研究 264 报道了书写技能训练的相关内容，但只涉及3名儿童。经过强化训练后（每周2次，每次 45分钟；以及持续13周的家庭作业），其中2名儿童有所改善。

虽然智能手机、平板电脑和笔记本电脑等现代技术使用有所增加，并且在某种程度上（取决于文化背景和社会环境）儿童对书写的依赖程度有所下降，但由书写障碍引发的参与问题仍是DCD儿童面临的一个严峻考验。操作键盘和鼠标也是精细运动能力，这可能会给DCD儿童造成问题，他们可能需要接受训练。为防止DCD儿童书写或操作电脑问题带来的对学业成绩的影响（被贴上差生或学习成绩差的标签），可建议进行键盘和平板电脑操作的同步训练。

### Daprodustat for the treatment of anemia in patients undergoing dialysis [^113jHi3S]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study ASCEND-D was published by Ajay K Singh and colleagues in 2021 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Anemia of chronic kidney disease and Chronic kidney disease. In the ASCEND-D study, the trial question was: is daprodustat noninferior to ESAs for anemia in patients with CKD undergoing dialysis? In the ASCEND-D study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the ASCEND-D study, the population was: 2964 patients (1266 female, 1698 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with CKD undergoing dialysis and who had a hemoglobin level of 8.0–11.5 g/dL. The key exclusion criteria were anemia unrelated to CKD; recent cardiovascular event; current or recent cancer; kidney transplant; transferrin saturation; gastrointestinal bleeding; myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome; stroke or TIA ≤ 4 weeks prior to screening through to randomization. In the ASCEND-D study, the interventions were: n = 1487 daprodustat (starting dose of 4–12 mg/day with stepped dose adjustment from 1–24 mg) n = 1477 ESAs (epoetin alfa if receipt of hemodialysis or darbepoetin alfa if receipt of peritoneal dialysis). In the ASCEND-D study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in mean improvement in hemoglobin level from baseline to weeks 28 through 52 (0.28 g/dL vs. 0.1 g/dL; MD 0.18, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.24). In the ASCEND-D study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in major adverse cardiovascular event (25.2% vs. 26.7%; HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.07) Significant decrease in major adverse cardiovascular event or thromboembolic event (33.4% vs. 36.8%; HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 1) No significant difference in major adverse cardiovascular event or hospitalization for HF (28.6% vs. 29.3%; HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.11). In the ASCEND-D study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in major adverse cardiovascular event, serious adverse events. In the ASCEND-D study, the conclusion was: in patients with CKD undergoing dialysis and who had a hemoglobin level of 8.0–11.5 g/dL, daprodustat was noninferior to ESAs with respect to mean improvement in hemoglobin level from baseline to weeks 28 through 52.

### D-dimer level is associated with the severity of COVID-19 [^1135G5h3]. Thrombosis Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Abnormal coagulation function has been demonstrated to be involved in the disease progression of COVID-19. However, the association between D-dimer levels and the severity of COVID-19 is not clear. The study was aimed to investigate the association between D-dimer levels and the severity of COVID-19 based on a cohort study and meta-analysis.

Materials and Methods

Demographic and clinical data of all confirmed cases with COVID-19 on admission to Tongji Hospital from January 27 to March 5, 2020, were collected and analyzed, and coagulation function parameters were described and compared between patients with severe infection and those with non-severe infection. Cohort studies reporting risk estimates for the D-dimer and severity of COVID-19 association were searched and included to perform a meta-analysis.

Results

In our cohort study, patients with severe disease were more likely to exhibit dysregulated coagulation function, and a significantly higher D-dimer level (median 1.8 μg/ml [interquartile range 0.9–4.6] vs 0.5 [0.3–1.1], p < 0.001) was found in severe cases than the mild ones, on admission. In the meta-analysis of 13 cohort studies (including the current study), patients with severe disease had an increase in mean D-dimer value by 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.51–1.31, p < 0.001) μg/ml compared to those with non-severe disease, and odds of severe infection was associated with D-dimer greater than 0.5 μg/ml (odds ratio = 5.78, 95% confidence interval, 2.16–15.44, p < 0.001) on admission.

Conclusions

Patients with severe COVID-19 have a higher level of D-dimer than those with non-severe disease, and D-dimer greater than 0.5 μg/ml is associated with severe infection in patients with COVID-19.

In Europe, micronutrient recommendations have been established by (inter)national committees of experts and are used by public health-policy decision makers to monitor and assess the adequacy of the diets of population groups. Current micronutrient recommendations are, however, heterogeneous, whereas the scientific basis for this is not obvious. Alignment of setting micronutrient recommendations is necessary to improve the transparency of the process, the objectivity and reliability of recommendations that are derived by diverse regional and (inter)national bodies.

Objective

This call for alignment of micronutrient recommendations is a direct result of the current sociopolitical climate in Europe and uncovers the need for an institutional architecture. There is a need for evidence-based policy making, transparent decision making, stakeholder involvement and alignment of policies across Europe.

Results

In this paper, we propose a General Framework that describes the process leading from assessing nutritional requirements to policy applications, based on evidence from science, stakeholder interests and the sociopolitical context. The framework envisions the derivation of nutrient recommendations as scientific methodology, embedded in a policy-making process that also includes consumer issues, and acknowledges the influences of the wider sociopolitical context by distinguishing the principal components of the framework: (a) defining the nutrient requirements for health, (b) setting nutrient recommendations, (c) policy options and (d) policy applications.

Conclusion

The General Framework can serve as a basis for a systematic and transparent approach to the development and review of micronutrient requirements in Europe, as well as the decision making of scientific advisory bodies, policy makers and stakeholders involved in this process of assessing, developing and translating these recommendations into public health nutrition policy.

### Preventive health behavior change text message interventions: a meta-analysis [^117Qrwrt]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Existing evidence shows that text message interventions can produce short-term health behavior change. However, understanding is limited regarding intervention characteristics moderating this effect or the long-term effectiveness of text message interventions on behavior change after contact stops.

Evidence Acquisition

MEDLINE, PubMed Central, ERIC, PsycINFO, and Web of Science were searched for articles published between April 2008 and December 2014 that evaluated an intervention targeting preventive health behaviors, delivered primarily by text message.

Evidence Synthesis

Intervention development and design characteristics and research outcomes were evaluated for 51 studies. Thirty-five studies were included in a meta-analysis (conducted in 2015) examining overall effect size and moderators of effect size. The overall pooled effect of interventions was d = 0.24 (95% CI = 0.16, 0.32, p < 0.001) using outcome data collected most proximal to intervention cessation. Seven studies collected data following a no-intervention maintenance period and showed a small but significant pooled maintenance effect (d = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.03, 0.31, p = 0.017, k = 7). Few variables significantly moderated intervention efficacy. Interventions that did not use a theoretic basis, used supplementary intervention components, and had a duration of 6–12 months were most effective. The specific behavior being targeted was not associated with differences in efficacy nor was tailoring, targeting, or personalization of text message content.

Conclusions

Text message interventions are capable of producing positive change in preventive health behaviors. Preliminary evidence indicates that these effects can be maintained after the intervention stops. The moderator analysis findings are at odds with previous research, suggesting a need to examine moderators at the behavior-specific level.

### Real-time decoding of question-and-answer speech dialogue using human cortical activity [^1172S9Jg]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

For each time segment that was labeled as a question event, a classification model was used to analyze the high gamma activity and compute question likelihoods using phone-level Viterbi decoding(Fig. 1e). In this approach, a hidden Markov model (HMM) was used to represent each question utterance and estimate the probability of observing a time segment of high gamma activity assuming that the participant was hearing the sequence of phones that comprise the utterance. The most likely question was output as the decoded question (Fig. 1f).

We hypothesized that answer decoding could be improved by utilizing knowledge about the previously decoded question. We designed this question-and-answer task such that specific answer responses were only valid for certain questions (Table 1). For example, if a participant heard the question "How is your room currently?", there were five valid answers ("Bright", "Dark", "Hot", "Cold", and "Fine"). We used the relationship between each question and the valid answers to define context priors (Fig. 1g), which were represented by a flat probability distribution for within-question answers and zero probability for out-of-question answers. A context integration model combined these context priors with decoded question likelihoods to compute answer prior probabilities (Fig. 1h). This context integration model was used during online real-time decoding and offline analysis (except where specifically indicated).

Table 1
The question/answer sets

As with question decoding, for each time segment that was labeled as an answer event, a classification model was used to analyze the high gamma activity and compute answer likelihoods using phone-level Viterbi decoding (Fig. 1i). The context integration model combined these answer likelihoods with the answer priors to obtain answer posterior probabilities (Fig. 1j), and the answer with the highest posterior probability was output as the decoded answer (Fig. 1k).

Prior to testing, models were fit using data collected during separate training task blocks. The question classification models were fit using data collected while participants listened to multiple repetitions of each of the question stimuli, and the answer classification models were fit using data collected while participants read each answer aloud multiple times. The speech detection models were fit using both of these types of training task blocks. Information about the amount of data collected for training and testing with each participant is provided in Supplementary Table 1.

### Methodologies for the development of CHEST guidelines and expert panel reports [^116vrcED]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

CHEST grading framework — dimensions and evidence adjustment are defined explicitly. The CHEST grading system defines the grades based on two key dimensions: (1) the balance of benefits of the proposed action as compared with the possible harms or risks and (2) the methodologic quality of the supporting evidence. Both factors are represented in the overall grade, with the former represented by 1 or 2 and the latter A, B, or C. The methodologic quality is initially based on the hierarchy of study design, but studies can be upgraded or downgraded based on specific criteria (eg, existence of methodologic flaws, directness, precision, consistency of results).

### Interim guidance for medical screening and hazard surveillance for workers potentially exposed to engineered nanoparticles [^113QJSck]. CDC (2009). Medium credibility.

Appendix F — exposure registries for occupational or environmental hazards — defines registries as structured surveillance tools to identify and maintain communication with exposed workers and to manage primary or secondary preventive efforts. Purposes include to delineate a population at risk, follow a cohort to ascertain exposure–disease associations, ensure appropriate primary and secondary prevention and medical surveillance, allow social/legal/economic support, demonstrate societal concern and provide a base for political action, and notify a cohort of exposure, preventive measures, or therapeutic advances not known when the registry was established. Development considerations state that various issues should be addressed, including the term of the registry, needs of registrants, confidentiality, cost, and potential impact on workers and companies. Registries are described as collections of individual worker information over time with at least a preliminary plan for analysis, but they are not always useful in etiologic research because exposure classification is often difficult, the statistical power of prospective studies is low, the time period may be impractically long, and changes in exposures over time may complicate establishing clear exposure–disease relationships. Nonetheless, registries may provide opportunities to determine the exposure–disease association and risk, can be used to establish hypotheses, and key design questions include how exposed persons can be adequately differentiated from nonexposed persons.

### The oncology data network (ODN): a collaborative European data-sharing platform to inform cancer care [^112n95xf]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

The ODN Captures Big Data to Meet the Challenges of Precision Cancer Medicine

Creation of the ODN was supported by the Collaboration for Oncology Data in Europe, a multistakeholder, multidisciplinary initiative that was established in 2017 by human data science company IQVIA (Durham, NC; formerly QuintilesIMS), with the backing of leading biopharmaceutical companies. The key features of the ODN are summarized in Table 1. Data on cancer medicine use are collated through technology‐enabled automation direct from participating hospitals' existing systems. A "common data model" translates data from diverse sources into a common language enabling direct comparability via an automated regimen mapping algorithm.

Table 1
Features of the ODN

A data‐sharing platform of the size, scale, and ambition of the ODN could deliver a wide range of clinically relevant benefits: (a) insights from ODN analyses may enable clinicians to reflect on their current practice at a "big picture" level; compare their own clinical decision making with that of their peers in privacy‐protecting ways locally, regionally, nationally, and internationally; carry out assessments comparing real‐world treatment regimens with those recommended by best practice guidelines; and benchmark clinical endpoints against other institutions to drive up quality. (b) The network may offer an agile way for participating sites to connect and set up new collaborations, both at scale and within special interest subgroups (e.g. groups focused on specific tumors or genotypes). (c) ODN analyses could help inform policy making within oncology by providing regulators with clinical context for new drug candidates and insights on real‐world use of postapproval products. In addition to using data from randomized controlled trials, decision‐makers are increasingly valuing robust, dependable real‐world data analyses when considering the role and value of particular treatments and when formulating clinical guidelines 20, 21. (d) The ODN has the potential to stimulate and catalyze research in numerous ways. For example, it could be used to shed light on parameters such as the case mix, speed of adoption and performance of novel medicines, and the anecdotal use of therapies in rare tumor types and defined subgroups. It could enable observational‐type studies to be carried out quickly and cost‐effectively. It could also facilitate recruitment for clinical trials by identifying sites that have potentially eligible patients. (e) Finally, ODN insights on the real‐world use and benefits of cancer medicines may enable flexible, value‐based payment agreements to be put in place, which will help to safeguard long‐term financial sustainability without disincentivizing innovation.

Having finalised the overarching guideline question (step 7), this is broken down into key questions to be addressed within the guideline. Key questions must be clearly formulated and the guideline development group should consider whether each key question is best addressed by quantitative or qualitative evidence or by a combination of both. The review team should decide whether these key questions are best addressed by evidence retrieved by an overarching guideline search, with evidence sifted and mapped to each key question, or whether specific supplementary searches are required for each key question (step 8). Online supplementary table 2 includes what should be considered at each stage of the question formulation process.

### FUTURE-AI: international consensus guideline for trustworthy and deployable artificial intelligence in healthcare [^117NQsDX]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Traceability

The traceability principle states that medical AI tools should be developed together with mechanisms for documenting and monitoring the complete trajectory of the AI tool, from development and validation to deployment and usage. This will increase transparency and accountability by providing detailed and continuous information on the AI tools during their lifetime to clinicians, healthcare organisations, citizens and patients, AI developers, and relevant authorities. AI traceability will also enable continuous auditing of AI models, identify risks and limitations, and update the AI models when needed.

Traceability 1: Implement risk management

Throughout the AI tool's lifecycle, the multidisciplinary development team shall analyse potential risks, assess each risk's likelihood, effects and risk-benefit balance, define risk mitigation measures, monitor the risks and mitigations continuously, and maintain a risk management file. The risks might include those explicitly covered by the FUTURE-AI guiding principles (eg, bias, harm, data breach), but also application specific risks. Other risks to consider include human factors that might lead to misuse of the AI tool (eg, not following the instructions, receiving insufficient training), application of the AI tool to individuals who are not within the target population, use of the tool by others than the target end users (eg, technician instead of physician), hardware failure, incorrect data annotations or input values, and adversarial attacks. Mitigation measures might include warnings to the users, system shutdown, reprocessing of the input data, the acquisition of new input data, or the use of an alternative procedure or human judgment only. Monitoring and reassessment of risk might involve the use of various feedback channels, such as customer feedback and complaints, as well as logged real world performance and issues (see traceability 5).

Traceability 2: Provide documentation

To increase transparency, traceability, and accountability, adequate documentation should be created and maintained for the AI tool, which might include (a) an AI information leaflet to inform citizens and healthcare professionals about the tool's intended use, risks (eg, biases) and instructions for use; (b) a technical document to inform AI developers, health organisations, and regulators about the AI model's properties (eg, hyperparameters), training and testing data, evaluation criteria and results, biases and other limitations, and periodic audits and updates; (c) a publication based on existing AI reporting standards; and (d) a risk management file (see traceability 1).
