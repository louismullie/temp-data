## Question

Elevated PTH, normal vitamin D, and normal, normal calcium

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage elevated PTH with normal vitamin D and normal calcium, and what the most likely diagnosis and next steps should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the biochemical abnormality and excluding assay or sampling issues. Then, I should verify that secondary causes of hyperparathyroidism are excluded, especially vitamin D deficiency, chronic kidney disease, malabsorption, medications, and hypercalciuria. Next, I will consider the differential diagnosis, including normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. After that, I should assess end-organ involvement to guide management. Finally, I will outline surveillance versus surgical thresholds and summarize a practical plan with timelines and follow-up tests.

> Let me first confirm the biochemical abnormality and avoid premature conclusions. I need to ensure that the elevated PTH is persistent on at least two occasions over 3–6 months and that both total and ionized calcium are truly normal, because transient fluctuations and assay variability can mislead us. Using a second- or third-generation intact PTH assay improves reliability, and I should double-check albumin-corrected total calcium or obtain ionized calcium if normocalcemic PHPT is suspected [^820553dd] [^5ba40044].

> Wait, let me verify secondary causes before labeling this as primary disease. Even though vitamin D is reported as normal, I should confirm 25-hydroxyvitamin D is at least 30 ng/mL, because insufficiency can still drive secondary hyperparathyroidism and confound interpretation; if low, I should replete and then re-evaluate PTH after 8–12 weeks to see if it normalizes, which would argue against normocalcemic PHPT [^5194e6ad] [^086f4f1b]. I also need to check renal function, since eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m² is a common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism and should be excluded before diagnosing normocalcemic PHPT [^a1be9275] [^08ca568f]. I should review medications such as thiazides, lithium, and loop diuretics, and screen for gastrointestinal malabsorption or prior bariatric surgery, all of which can elevate PTH secondarily [^08ca568f] [^5ba40044].

> Hold on, I should verify the calcium handling in the kidney because hypercalciuria can mimic or accompany PHPT. A 24-hour urine calcium collection, ideally after vitamin D repletion and on a stable calcium intake of 1,000–1,200 mg/day, helps distinguish PHPT from familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia; a calcium-to-creatinine clearance ratio less than 0.01 supports FHH, whereas values greater than 0.02 favor PHPT, with an intermediate gray zone that may require genetic testing or family screening [^158173b6] [^667b58bf]. Let me reconsider the timing: if vitamin D was already normal, I can proceed now, but if I just repleted vitamin D, I should wait 2–4 weeks before collecting urine to avoid transient effects [^667b58bf].

> If secondary causes are excluded, I should confirm the diagnosis of normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism. By definition, this is persistently elevated intact PTH with normal total and ionized calcium on at least two occasions over 3–6 months, in the absence of vitamin D deficiency, CKD, malabsorption, hypercalciuria, or medications that raise PTH; prevalence in referral populations is around 0.1–0.2%, though estimates vary with ascertainment and definitions [^820553dd] [^97f0bc76] [^824758a6]. I need to ensure I am not missing intermittent hypercalcemia, because some patients with apparent normocalcemic PHPT show episodic hypercalcemia on longitudinal follow-up, reinforcing that this is a spectrum of PHPT rather than a distinct entity [^97f0bc76] [^08ca568f].

> Next, I should review end-organ involvement to guide management. I will assess bone mineral density with DXA, paying special attention to the distal one-third radius, which is typically more affected than the lumbar spine in PHPT; vertebral imaging is reasonable if osteoporosis is suspected or if there is height loss or back pain [^66dea13c] [^667b58bf]. I should screen for nephrolithiasis with renal imaging if there is a history of stones or hypercalciuria, and consider nephrocalcinosis in the right clinical context [^667b58bf]. Let me also check for hypertension, glucose intolerance, and neurocognitive symptoms, which, while nonspecific, have been associated with PHPT and may influence shared decision-making [^08ca568f].

> I will now examine management options, balancing surgery versus surveillance. Parathyroidectomy is the only curative therapy and is indicated for symptomatic PHPT or asymptomatic patients who meet guideline criteria, including age under 50, serum calcium more than 1.0 mg/dL above the upper limit of normal, osteoporosis, vertebral fracture, nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis, creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min, or hypercalciuria; these criteria apply to normocalcemic PHPT as well, and patients with nPHPT may have a higher rate of multigland disease, so I should counsel on the possibility of bilateral exploration and remedial surgery [^ca82b54c] [^df7528de] [^fd3394e3]. If surgery is deferred or contraindicated, medical therapy can stabilize bone density with antiresorptives such as alendronate and control hypercalcemia with cinacalcet, though cinacalcet has limited PTH-lowering effect and does not improve bone density; calcium and vitamin D should be optimized to at least 30 ng/mL without provoking hypercalcemia [^c5728af7] [^5194e6ad].

> But wait, what if the calcium-to-creatinine clearance ratio is low, suggesting familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. I should double-check family history and consider calcium-sensing receptor gene testing, because FHH is a benign, autosomal dominant condition that does not benefit from parathyroidectomy and can be confused with PHPT; distinguishing FHH from PHPT prevents unnecessary surgery and guides appropriate counseling [^158173b6] [^0465e822].

> Let me outline a practical follow-up plan if I choose surveillance. I should recheck calcium and PTH every 6–12 months, monitor renal function annually, and repeat bone density every 1–2 years, while maintaining vitamin D sufficiency and adequate calcium intake; I should also educate the patient to report symptoms such as bone pain, fractures, kidney stones, or polyuria, which would prompt reconsideration of surgery [^7af57e8f] [^5194e6ad]. I should confirm that the patient understands the possibility of progression to hypercalcemia over time, which occurs in a minority but warrants vigilance [^08ca568f].

> In summary, after confirming persistent PTH elevation with normal calcium and vitamin D and excluding secondary causes, the most likely diagnosis is normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism. I need to ensure I have assessed bone, kidney, and metabolic comorbidities, and then align management with guideline-based surgical criteria or pursue structured surveillance with medical therapy as appropriate, recognizing that a subset will evolve to hypercalcemic PHPT and that FHH must remain in the differential if urinary calcium is low [^820553dd] [^158173b6] [^97f0bc76].

Elevated PTH with normal calcium and normal vitamin D most often reflects **normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism** (nPHPT) [^820553dd] — a variant of PHPT with elevated PTH but normal calcium — or **early/mild PHPT** where calcium is still normal [^687d7cf2]. Other causes include **renal calcium leak** (idiopathic hypercalciuria), **medications** (thiazides, lithium), or **assay interference**. Evaluate with repeat calcium (total and ionized), PTH, 25(OH)D, creatinine/eGFR, phosphate, and 24-hour urine calcium; if calcium is borderline or PTH is only mildly elevated, recheck after 3–6 months. Management is guided by symptoms, bone density, and renal involvement: surgery for those meeting criteria or with progression, otherwise monitor calcium, PTH, renal function, and bone density annually [^ca82b54c] [^7af57e8f].

---

## Physiological regulation of PTH and calcium

PTH maintains calcium homeostasis by increasing bone resorption, renal calcium reabsorption, and intestinal calcium absorption via 1,25(OH)2D; **calcium normally suppresses PTH** via the calcium-sensing receptor [^46043555]. Elevated PTH with normal calcium implies **inappropriately high PTH** despite adequate calcium and vitamin D, indicating dysregulated parathyroid function or another driver of PTH secretion [^820553dd].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Several conditions can cause **elevated PTH with normal calcium and vitamin D**:

| **Category** | **Condition** | **Key features** |
|-|-|-|
| Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) | - Normocalcemic PHPT (nPHPT) <br/> - Early/mild PHPT | - Elevated PTH <br/> - Normal calcium <br/> - Exclude secondary causes [^820553dd] [^08ca568f] |
| Secondary hyperparathyroidism | - Renal calcium leak (idiopathic hypercalciuria) <br/> - Medications (thiazides, lithium) <br/> - Assay interference | - Elevated PTH <br/> - Normal calcium <br/> - Normal vitamin D <br/> - Identify cause [^08ca568f] [^158173b6] |
| Tertiary hyperparathyroidism | - Chronic kidney disease <br/> - Long-standing secondary HPT | - Elevated PTH <br/> - Normal/high calcium <br/> - Normal vitamin D <br/> - CKD history [^a1be9275] |
| Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) | - Calcium-sensing receptor mutation | - Mild hypercalcemia <br/> - Elevated/normal PTH <br/> - Low urine calcium <br/> - Family history [^158173b6] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A **structured approach** is essential:

- **Confirm persistence**: Repeat calcium (total and ionized), PTH, and 25(OH)D on two occasions 3–6 months apart [^820553dd].
- **Exclude secondary causes**: Check creatinine/eGFR, phosphate, magnesium, and 24-hour urine calcium to assess for renal calcium leak, CKD, or medications [^5ba40044].
- **Differentiate PHPT from FHH**: Use calcium-to-creatinine clearance ratio; < 0.01 suggests FHH, > 0.02 suggests PHPT, 0.01–0.02 is indeterminate and may need genetic testing [^158173b6].
- **Imaging**: Neck ultrasound or sestamibi scan if surgery is considered; localize only after biochemical confirmation [^183e9df4].

---

## Clinical significance and progression

nPHPT is a recognized PHPT variant with risks of **bone loss, nephrolithiasis, and progression to hypercalcemia** [^08ca568f] [^97f0bc76]. Progression to hypercalcemia occurs in about 10–20% over 3–5 years, so longitudinal monitoring is warranted [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on symptoms, bone density, renal involvement, and patient preference:

- **Surgery**: Parathyroidectomy is indicated for symptomatic patients or those with osteoporosis, vertebral fracture, nephrolithiasis, or serum calcium > 1.0 mg/dL above normal; nPHPT follows the same criteria as classic PHPT [^ca82b54c] [^fd3394e3].
- **Medical management**: For asymptomatic patients not meeting surgical criteria, monitor calcium, PTH, renal function, and bone density annually; consider bisphosphonates for bone loss and cinacalcet if hypercalcemia develops [^c5728af7].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Maintain adequate calcium intake (1000–1200 mg/day), vitamin D sufficiency (> 30 ng/mL), hydration, and avoid thiazides/lithium if possible [^c5728af7] [^5194e6ad].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up is essential to detect progression or complications. Annual monitoring should include **serum calcium, PTH, creatinine/eGFR, and bone density** (DXA every 1–2 years) [^7af57e8f]. Educate patients on symptoms of hypercalcemia, nephrolithiasis, and bone pain, and reassess surgical indications if calcium rises or end-organ involvement emerges [^ca82b54c].

---

Elevated PTH with normal calcium and vitamin D most often reflects **nPHPT or early PHPT**, but secondary causes must be excluded. A structured evaluation — confirming persistence, excluding secondary drivers, and assessing end-organ involvement — guides whether to observe or operate, with surgery for those with symptoms or target-organ damage and surveillance for others [^820553dd] [^ca82b54c].

Normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism is a common biochemical finding, usually identified during an assessment of bone or renal health. Hypercalcaemia must be considered by calculation of adjusted calcium, and a careful history taken to assess dietary calcium intake and for the possibility of a malabsorption syndrome. 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) should be measured and replaced if indicated. The management plan for the patient is influenced by the context in which calcium and PTH were measured. In this brief review we describe the assessment of a patient with normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism.

Background

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), the most common cause of hypercalcemia, is most often identified in postmenopausal women. The clinical presentation of PHPT has evolved over the past 40 years to include three distinct clinical phenotypes, each of which has been studied in detail and has led to evolving concepts about target organ involvement, natural history, and management.

Methods

In the present review, I provide an evidence-based summary of this disorder as it has been studied worldwide, citing key concepts and data that have helped to shape our concepts about this disease.

Results

PHPT is now recognized to include three clinical phenotypes: overt target organ involvement, mild asymptomatic hypercalcemia, and high PTH levels with persistently normal albumin-corrected and ionized serum calcium values. The factors that determine which of these clinical presentations is more likely to predominate in a given country include the extent to which biochemical screening is used, vitamin D deficiency is present, and whether parathyroid hormone levels are routinely measured in the evaluation of low bone density or frank osteoporosis. Guidelines for parathyroidectomy apply to all three clinical forms of the disease. If surgical guidelines are not met, parathyroidectomy can also be an appropriate option if no medical contraindications are present. If either the serum calcium or bone mineral density is of concern and surgery is not an option, pharmacological approaches are available and effective.

Conclusions

Advances in our knowledge of PHPT have guided new concepts in diagnosis and management.

### Significance of elevated parathyroid hormone after parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism [^2e192e12]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide a clinical update on persistent parathyroid hormone (PTH) elevation after surgical resection for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and to suggest a schedule for follow-up monitoring and strategies for future study.

Methods

We reviewed the literature targeting studies with detailed analysis of biochemical parameters before and after parathyroidectomy for PHPT. We focused on potential etiologies and currently available outcome data.

Results

PTH elevation with eucalcemia after parathyroidectomy for PHPT occurs in 12% to 43% of patients. Underlying etiology is probably multifactorial, and possible causes include bone hunger, vitamin D deficiency, inadequate calcium intake or absorption, reduced peripheral sensitivity to PTH, underlying chronic kidney disease, and/or a renal leak of calcium. No consensus exists on how to follow-up and treat these patients.

Conclusions

Although most patients with PTH elevation after parathyroidectomy will have normalization of PTH levels with time and/or calcium and vitamin D supplementation, this finding may be an early indicator of autonomous parathyroid secretion in a small number of patients. Patients with persistent PTH elevation should be monitored over time for recurrence of PHPT and other possible complications. A standardized follow-up protocol is needed to better study and elucidate the clinical significance of elevated PTH after parathyroidectomy.

### Significance of elevated parathyroid hormone after parathyroidectomy [^514a47e3]. Endocrine Practice (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the prevalence of parathyroid hormone elevation after parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism and to discuss possible mechanisms.

Methods

A Medline search of the English-language literature published between 1990 and 2009 was performed using the search terms "elevated PTH after parathyroidectomy". All of the identified articles reported either prospective or retrospective studies without control groups. Studies that included patients with secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism were not reviewed.

Results

Within 1 week to 5 years after parathyroidectomy, 9% to 62% of patients with a normal serum calcium concentration are reported to have an elevated parathyroid hormone concentration. No evidence suggests that postoperative normocalcemic parathyroid hormone elevation is an indication of surgical failure and recurrent hypercalcemia. Preoperative findings in patients with postoperative parathyroid hormone elevation include lower vitamin D concentration, higher concentrations of bone turnover markers, and higher parathyroid hormone concentration. Potential mechanisms for parathyroid hormone elevation in the setting of normocalcemia include vitamin D deficiency, hungry bone syndrome, and parathyroid hormone resistance. Study findings suggest a possible benefit of postoperative calcium and vitamin D supplementation, but no randomized trials have been done.

Conclusion

Elevation of parathyroid hormone commonly occurs after parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: what is the role of parathyroid surgery? [^824758a6]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is an endocrine condition resulting from inappropriate parathyroid hormone (PTH) hypersecretion. Traditionally, the biochemical profile of PHPT is elevated serum calcium (> 2.6 mmol/l) with elevated or 'inappropriately normal' PTH that may result in multi-system complications, including fractures and nephrolithiasis. However, an increasingly common biochemical profile is of raised PTH in the context of normal serum calcium (total and ionised), vitamin D and renal function – recognised as normocalcaemic PHPT (nPHPT). This biochemical picture is largely being discovered in patients through osteoporosis screening. Whilst the reported prevalence of nPHPT varies significantly within the literature (0.1–8.9%), a recent retrospective study of 6280 patients by Schini et al. reported a prevalence of 0.18%.

### What medical options should be considered for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism? [^ab14eb79]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common, often asymptomatic, endocrine disorder characterized by hypercalcaemia in the face of a nonsuppressed parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. For those with symptomatic disease or who meet surgical criteria, parathyroidectomy is the treatment of choice. However, those patients who do not meet surgical criteria or who cannot undergo or refuse surgery must be managed medically. Medical management of PHPT involves continual assessment to determine who will benefit from surgical intervention, replacement of vitamin D, treatment of parathyroid bone disease and management of hypercalcaemia and renal stone disease.

### Machine learning-based prediction of elevated PTH levels among the US general population [^79b05da9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is the main regulator of calcium homeostasis. Elevation of PTH levels was observed particularly among patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and secondary hyperparathyroidism due to vitamin D deficiency and chronic kidney diseases with inappropriately treated calcium and phosphate level. While the causal relationship between PTH and long-term health outcomes has not been fully elucidated, some previous studies reported the association between elevated PTH and all-cause or cardiovascular mortality even among the general population. Given these findings and other common manifestations of primary hyperparathyroidism (eg, osteoporosis, vertebral fractures, hypercalciuria, nephrolithiasis), the early and judicious detection of elevated PTH is important in general clinical settings. However, a previous study showed the fact that PTH was evaluated in only 55% of the patients who were likely to have primary hyperparathyroidism. Particularly, primary normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism, a mild phenotype of primary hyperparathyroidism, would be more difficult to be suspected in general clinical practice. Furthermore, as vitamin D deficiency — a common condition with a prevalence rate of 5.9% among US adults — sometimes lead to osteoporosis due to secondary hyperparathyroidism, prediction of elevated PTH is also useful for the diagnosis of such secondary hyperparathyroidism due to vitamin D deficiency. In this context, it is imperative to develop a high-performance prediction model for elevated PTH from standard biochemical information to assist the effective screening and avoid the underdetection of this endocrine disorder among the general population.

Over the last decade, in line with the availability of big data and rapidly increasing computational capacity, machine-learning algorithms have attracted substantial attention because of their high performance to predict health outcomes. Although a few previous studies in the United States applied and built prediction models for primary hyperparathyroidism, they did not include comprehensive data (eg, socioeconomic status and standard biochemical data including liver function and electrolytes) in their prediction model. Moreover, other diseases that might be underdiagnosed in the general population but impair health status, including primary normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism and secondary hyperparathyroidism due to vitamin D deficiency, were not included in their model, limiting their utility to answer the clinically important question: Who should be targeted for PTH evaluation in general clinical settings?

To address this knowledge gap, using a nationally representative database of US adults along with several machine-learning algorithms, we developed several machine learning–based models to predict elevated PTH levels from commonly available demographic information and biomarkers. We then compared the performance of each model, and assessed variables that largely contribute to the prediction of elevated PTH levels.

### Hyperparathyroidism [^83ca9279]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common endocrine disorder of calcium metabolism characterised by hypercalcaemia and elevated or inappropriately normal concentrations of parathyroid hormone. Almost always, primary hyperparathyroidism is due to a benign overgrowth of parathyroid tissue either as a single gland (80% of cases) or as a multiple gland disorder (15–20% of cases). Primary hyperparathyroidism is generally discovered when asymptomatic but the disease always has the potential to become symptomatic, resulting in bone loss and kidney stones. In countries where biochemical screening tests are not common, symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism tends to predominate. Another variant of primary hyperparathyroidism has been described in which the serum calcium concentration is within normal range but parathyroid hormone is elevated in the absence of any obvious cause. Primary hyperparathyroidism can be cured by removal of the parathyroid gland or glands but identification of patients who are best advised to have surgery requires consideration of the guidelines that are regularly updated. Recommendations for patients who do not undergo parathyroid surgery include monitoring of serum calcium concentrations and bone density.

### Parathyroid disorders [^ddace8e7]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Parathyroid disorders are most often identified incidentally by abnormalities in serum calcium levels when screening for renal or bone disease or other conditions. Parathyroid hormone, which is released by the parathyroid glands primarily in response to low calcium levels, stimulates osteoclastic bone resorption and serum calcium elevation, reduces renal calcium clearance, and stimulates intestinal calcium absorption through synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Primary hyperparathyroidism, in which calcium levels are elevated without appropriate suppression of parathyroid hormone levels, is the most common cause of hypercalcemia and is often managed surgically. Indications for parathyroidectomy in primary hyperparathyroidism include presence of symptoms, age 50 years or younger, serum calcium level more than 1 mg per dL above the upper limit of normal, osteoporosis, creatinine clearance less than 60 mL per minute per 1.73 m2, nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, and hypercalciuria. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is caused by alterations in calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D regulation that result in elevated parathyroid hormone levels. It most commonly occurs with chronic kidney disease and vitamin D deficiency, and less commonly with gastrointestinal conditions that impair calcium absorption. Secondary hyperparathyroidism can be managed with calcium and vitamin D replacement and reduction of high phosphate levels. There is limited evidence for the use of calcimimetics and vitamin D analogues for persistently elevated parathyroid hormone levels. Hypoparathyroidism, which is most commonly caused by iatrogenic surgical destruction of the parathyroid glands, is less common and results in hypocalcemia. Multiple endocrine neoplasia types 1 and 2A are rare familial syndromes that can result in primary hyperparathyroidism and warrant genetic testing of family members, whereas parathyroid cancer is a rare finding in patients with hyperparathyroidism.

### Hyperparathyroidism… [^0e5c9132]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Parathyroid Glands The four parathyroid glands normally are located behind the four poles of the thyroid gland. The glands secrete parathyroid hormone, which is the primary regulator of calcium homeostasis. 4 The glands tightly regulate the extracellular calcium concentration within a narrow normal range. The parathyroid glands respond within seconds to a low or falling serum calcium concentration. The chief cells of these glands can synthesize, process, and store PTH in a regulated manner and can replicate when chronically stimulated. These factors allow for short-, intermediate-, and long-term adaptability to fluctuations in the serum calcium level. 4, 5 PTH is an 84–amino-acid single-chain peptide that mobilizes calcium from the bones by osteoclastic stimulation. It also stimulates the kidneys to reabsorb calcium and convert 25-hydroxyvitamin D.

3 to the active form, 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 which, in turn, stimulates gastrointestinal absorption of calcium. Low circulating concentrations of calcium stimulate PTH secretion, and high circulating concentrations of calcium depress PTH secretion. PTH is metabolized rapidly in the liver and kidneys; its circulating half-life is approximately two to five minutes.
5. 1 In 10 to 20 percent of patients, primary hyperparathyroidism is caused by an inherited hyperfunction of multiple parathyroid glands. These patients tend to be diagnosed at a younger age.

1. The serum PTH level is elevated, and the serum calcium level may be normal or low, because of a diet that is limited in vitamin D or calcium, or because of deficiency secondary to malabsorption. In most instances, secondary hyperparathyroidism is caused by chronic renal failure, which results in a low concentration of 1, 25-dihydroxyvitaminD 3 because of decreased renal production. 4, 8.

|Asymptomatic| There are no clinical factors that predict the prognosis of patients with asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism. 9, 23 Studies have demonstrated that up to 25 percent of asymptomatic patients develop indications for surgery during medical observation. 1 Factors that can exacerbate hypercalcemia should be avoided and treated accordingly. Recommendations include modest intake of calcium and vitamin D. Theoretically, low calcium intake could stimulate PTH production. 1, 13.

### Persistently elevated parathyroid hormone after successful parathyroid surgery [^413b5723]. The Laryngoscope (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Explore potential causes of persistently elevated parathyroid hormone levels after curative parathyroidectomy in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism due to single gland disease.

Study Design

Case series with planned data collection.

Methods

An analysis was undertaken of 314 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism undergoing parathyroid surgery in a tertiary academic practice between January 2009 and April 2013. There were 187 patients with single-gland disease; 68 failed to meet inclusion criteria, resulting in a study population of 119 patients. Preoperative parathyroid hormone, calcium, ionized calcium, 25-OH-vitamin D, creatinine, and glomerular filtration rate values were determined, along with postoperative calcium, ionized calcium, and parathyroid hormone levels. Patients were divided into two groups based on their postoperative parathyroid hormone values: elevated parathyroid hormone and normal parathyroid hormone.

Results

Thirty (25.2%) patients achieved postoperative normocalcemia but had elevated parathyroid hormone levels. This group had significantly higher preoperative levels of parathyroid hormone (P = 0.002) and creatinine (P = 0.007), and a lower glomerular filtration rate (P = 0.002) than patients with normal postoperative parathyroid hormone levels. The preoperative 25-OH-vitamin D level was not significantly associated with an elevated parathyroid hormone (odds ratio [OR]: 1.56). Preoperative impaired renal function, specifically an abnormal glomerular filtration rate (OR: 12.8), was significantly associated with an elevated parathyroid hormone.

Conclusions

Parathyroid hormone remains elevated in 25% of patients who are cured (eucalcemic) after surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism. This phenomenon was associated with higher preoperative parathyroid hormone levels and impaired renal function rather than low 25-OH-vitamin D levels.

### Normal PTH levels in primary hyperparathyroidism: still the same disease? [^d0749534]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

Previous studies have suggested that primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) with only normal parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels is a milder, less symptomatic form of pHPT. This study investigates symptoms, laboratory values, imaging, and outcomes of sporadic pHPT patients with normal PTH values.

Methods

We reviewed our prospectively collected database of 861 patients with sporadic pHPT who underwent parathyroidectomy between December 1999 and June 2010. Patients with only normal PTH values for 6 months before surgery were compared to a randomized control group of sporadic pHPT patients with elevated PTH, matched 1:2 for age and gender.

Results

Fifty-eight (7%) patients had only normal PTH values within 6 months of surgery. The mean PTH was 55.1 pg/ml in the normal PTH group and 151.3 pg/ml in the control group (n = 116). There was no difference in preoperative calcium values, subjective symptoms, bone health, or the frequency of single-gland disease (SGD; 88% vs. 91%) between the two groups, but the normal PTH group had higher preoperative vitamin D values (30.8 vs. 21.4 ng/ml; P < 0.001), smaller adenomas (405 vs. 978 mg, P < 0.001), and more frequently underwent bilateral neck exploration (57% vs. 49%). There was a trend toward lower sensitivity of preoperative imaging in the normal PTH group.

Conclusions

Patients with pHPT and either elevated or normal PTH levels present with similar symptoms and calcium levels. The majority of patients with normal PTH have SGD, although adenomas are smaller. This may explain why patients with normal PTH values have less sensitive imaging and more frequently require four-gland exploration.

### Pseudohypoparathyroidism: a rare but important cause of hypocalcaemia [^64e0de22]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

We present a 46-year-old Caucasian lady with symptomatic hypocalcaemia. Investigations revealed markedly raised parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels with vitamin D deficiency. A number of conditions causing secondary hyperparathyroidism were ruled out from her medical history and initial investigations. The main differential diagnoses were vitamin D deficiency and PTH resistance (pseudohypoparathyroidism, PHP). With high-normal serum phosphate and normal alkaline phosphatase, and a lack of symptoms associated with osteomalacia, vitamin D deficiency alone was unlikely to be the cause of hypocalcaemia. Given a normal physical appearance, genetic testing was arranged and confirmed the diagnosis of PHP type Ib. She is currently taking activated vitamin D to maintain calcium homeostasis. PTH resistance is the hallmark of PHP, a rare complex genetic disorder, which can be easily missed resulting in potentially serious consequences.

### Eucalcemic parathyroid hormone elevation after parathyroidectomy for primary sporadic hyperparathyroidism: risk factors, trend, and outcome [^037b637d]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Although primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) remains a relatively uncommon endocrine disease among Asian countries with an incidence ranging between 0.5 and 1 per 3000 of the general population, it has been increasing over the last decade.–This is related to better patient education, increased disease awareness, and more frequent serum calcium screening. Similar to the West, parathyroidectomy proves to be a cost-effective and curative treatment for the majority pHPT patients. In experienced hands, the surgical cure rate approaches 95%–100% with minimal morbidity. However, despite attaining postoperative normocalcemia, parathyroid hormone (PTH) elevation is not uncommonly observed after surgery. In the literature, this phenomenon of eucalcemic parathyroid hormone elevation (ePTH) has been well described and studied, although the exact etiology remains poorly understood. A number of explanations or causes have been suggested, and they include relative postoperative hypocalcemia/vitamin D deficiency leading to secondary HPT, chronic renal impairment, renal leak of calcium, bone remineralization or bone hunger, changes in the calcium-sensing receptors, decreased vitamin D 1-alpha-hydroxylation, and PTH receptor downregulation as a response to the high preoperative PTH level.–Our clinical experience indicates that ePTH tends to concern referring physicians and treating surgeons alike. Furthermore, the natural history of postoperative ePTH and the optimal testing schedule following parathyroidectomy remains not entirely defined. More importantly, some authors have suggested that perhaps ePTH may imply "incomplete" parathyroidectomy or an early sign of future HPT recurrence. This issue is particularly relevant when an increasing number of surgeons are now performing focused or limited parathyroidectomy. Several studies so far have observed that when compared with patients with eucalcemic normal PTH level, patients with ePTH are at significantly higher rate of recurrence. Furthermore, it was found that 1-week serum calcium levels ≥ 9.7 mg/dL and a persistent PTH elevation predicted future recurrence. As a result, our study aimed to examine the risk factors, the trend of postoperative PTH level, and the long-term outcome in patients with ePTH 6 months after parathyroidectomy for pHPT by comparing perioperative variables and outcomes between pHPT patients with and without ePTH at 6-month after parathyroidectomy.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: what is the role of parathyroid surgery? [^df7528de]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is classically associated with both an elevated or 'inappropriately normal' parathyroid hormone (PTH) level and raised serum calcium. However, in clinical practice, increasing numbers of patients present with raised PTH but normal serum calcium, renal function and vitamin D; this is known as normocalcaemic PHPT (nPHPT). Studies investigating the clinical presentation of this condition have shown that patients may present with hypertension, nephrolithiasis, impaired glucose tolerance, osteoporosis and fragility fractures. The prevalence of such complications in nPHPT is similar to that in classical hypercalcaemic PHPT (hPHPT). Although the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have developed guidelines for the management of PHPT generally, a consensus is yet to be reached on the optimal management of nPHPT specifically. A review of the literature on parathyroidectomy in the treatment of nPHPT revealed that nPHPT patients were more likely to present with multi-glandular disease and significantly less nPHPT patients had an intra-operative PTH fall of > 50% compared with those with hPHPT. These findings demonstrate that patients with nPHPT are more likely to receive bilateral neck explorations and require remedial surgery compared with hPHPT patients. Following surgery, improvements in bone mineral density (BMD) and renal stones are generally observed in those with nPHPT. Where surgery is not possible, medical management with alendronate has been shown to be effective in nPHPT patients. Given the higher incidence of multi-gland disease and greater possibility of remedial surgery in nPHPT, careful consideration of risks and benefits should be made on an individualised basis and surgery should be performed by surgeons experienced in four gland exploration.

### Child with suspected hypocalcemia [^3b94b2f4]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Evaluation of pediatric hypocalcemia — other laboratory assessments and phosphorus context are outlined as follows: Other blood tests to be considered are: Intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level. Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are consistent with nutritional Vitamin D deficiency, and in this situation, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels may be normal or elevated due to the elevated PTH. The page also notes that parathyroid hormone increases phosphorous excretion leading to low phosphorus levels, while an elevated phosphorous level is seen with poor kidney function or pathology in the parathyroid hormone pathway.

Discussion

During recent years, there has been extensive discussion regarding the clinical entity of nHPT. It remains unclear whether an isolated elevated S‐PTH is pathological per se, an early marker of an upcoming pathological state, a marker of a syndrome or just a part of the ageing process. S‐PTH levels may rise due to low levels of circulating S‐25(OH)D levels, low calcium intake, renal disease and certain medications. 3 It is, however, uncertain to what extent elevated S‐PTH, with sustained S‐Ca levels and without the factors mentioned above, leads to pHPT or increased morbidity and mortality. 7

This study provides new data on the prevalence and natural history of nHPT in a nonreferral asymptomatic, random population cohort. After excluding subjects with renal insufficiency and vitamin D insufficiency, the prevalence of nHPT was 2·0% in the initial screening and 11·0% 13 years later. One individual developed mild hypercalcaemia with normal PTH at the age of 75 years. In addition, three of the twelve subjects with nHPT in 1995 had normalized completely in 2008, and subjects with pHPT in 1995 had normalized S‐PTH or had nHPT at follow‐up without surgical treatment.

### The use in clinical practice of parathyroid hormone normative values established in vitamin D-sufficient subjects [^d9b6105a]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

We have found recently that excluding subjects with low serum 25OHD has a significant impact on the PTH reference range (10–46 ng/liter instead of 10–65 ng/liter with the same assay). However, before being used routinely, this new range had to be clinically validated. We thus reviewed the chart of 708 consecutive osteopenic patients who were referred to our unit for a biological exploration in search of secondary causes for their low bone mass. They were classified into two groups. Group 1 (n = 360) included the patients for whom no reasons for high PTH were found after examination of their chart. Group 2 (n = 348) included patients with one of the following potential reasons for an increased PTH concentration: hyper- or hypocalcemia, normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), renal hypercalciuria, vitamin D insufficiency, chronic renal failure, use of bisphosphonates, and any chronic disease known to potentially alter calcium metabolism. Among the 360 group 1 patients, 15 (4.2%) had a serum PTH level more than 46 ng/liter, which is not different from the theoretical rate of 3% of normal subjects whose serum PTH may be above the 97th centile of the reference (chi(2) = 2.8; NS). Forty-two group 2 patients had a surgically proven PHPT. Among these, serum PTH was ≤ 65 ng/liter in 17 (40.5%) and ≤ 46 ng/liter in 5 (12%). In conclusion, our proposed PTH reference range allows to identify fewer patients with mild surgically proven PHPT who have a normal serum PTH concentration, without inducing an increase in the rate of falsely high PTH.

Introduction

Primary hyperparathyroidism is an endocrine disorder caused by one or more hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands. The suspicion of pHPT is typically raised by the detection of hypercalcemia and/or its associated symptoms. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) serum concentration is elevated, or within normal limits but inappropriate considering the presence of hypercalcemia. A rare type of pHPT is normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism presenting with normal serum calcium levels but an elevated PTH concentration.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is the third most common endocrine disease, affecting women 2–3 times more often than men. It is caused by the hyperfunction of one or more parathyroid glands, which are overproducing PTH. Hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands are solitary adenomas in the majority of cases. Approximately 15–20% of cases are caused by multiglandular disease (MGD), i.e. multiple adenomas or hyperplasia, while parathyroid carcinoma accounts for less than 1% of cases. The majority of pHPT cases (95%) occur sporadically, but approximately 5% are part of hereditary syndromes, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia types 1, 2, and 4 (MEN-1, MEN-2, and MEN-4) and hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome, or as part of non-syndromic familial pHPT.

Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, a potential differential diagnosis to pHPT, has to be recognized as it usually does not require surgery.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a disorder characterized by increased serum PTH levels due to parathyroid gland hyperplasia, triggered by hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, or decreased serum vitamin D concentration. The most common causes of sHPT are vitamin D deficiency and chronic renal disease. Sometimes pHPT and vitamin D deficiency occur simultaneously, which results in decreased or normal serum calcium levels. Rarer causes are long-term treatment with lithium or magnesium, intestinal malabsorption or malnutrition, or sunitinib treatment.

The therapy of sHPT depends on the primary cause. In the case of renal HPT, therapy mainly consists of a restriction of dietary intake together with medical treatment with calcimimetics, vitamin D analogues, and phosphorus binders. Still, parathyroidectomy is required in patients with renal sHPT refractory to medical treatment, i.e. in approximately 15% of patients after 10 years and 38% of patients after 20 years of renal dialysis therapy.

### Calcium, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism: normograms developed from 10, 000 cases [^03748e02]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To better define the typical and atypical biochemical profiles of patients with surgically proven primary hyperparathyroidism.

Methods

In this single-center, prospectively conducted study of consecutive patients with surgically proven primary hyperparathyroidism over a 7-year period, we analyzed serum calcium, parathyroid hormone, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations.

Results

A total of 10 000 patients were included, and more than 210 000 calcium, parathyroid hormone, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D values were evaluated. Both calcium and parathyroid hormone levels demonstrated a Gaussian distribution with the average calcium concentration being 10.9 ± 0.6 mg/dL and the average parathyroid hormone concentration being 105.8 ± 48 pg/mL. The average highest calcium and parathyroid hormone concentrations were 11.4 ± 0.7 mg/dL and 115.3 ± 50 pg/mL, respectively. At least 1 calcium value of 11.0 mg/dL was seen in 87% of patients, but only 21% had 1 or more calcium value above 11.5 mg/dL. Only 7% had a single serum calcium level reaching 12.0 mg/dL. Normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism was seen in just under 3% of patients who had identical findings at surgery. An average parathyroid hormone concentration less than 65 pg/mL was seen in 16%, with 10% of patients who had no high parathyroid hormone values. The average 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was 22.4 ± 9 ng/mL, with levels decreasing as calcium levels increased (P < .001); 36% had 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels below 20 ng/mL.

Conclusions

Patients with PHPT present with a number of distinct biochemical profiles, but as a group, they present with a near-normal Gaussian distribution of both calcium and parathyroid hormone levels. Either serum calcium or parathyroid hormone remained normal in 13% of patients, yet the findings at surgery are similar to those of patients with elevated calcium or parathyroid hormone. Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D is an expected finding in patients with PHPT, decreasing as serum calcium levels increase.

### Hyperparathyroidism [^1531f439]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Hyperparathyroidism is due to increased activity of the parathyroid glands, either from an intrinsic abnormal change altering excretion of parathyroid hormone (primary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism) or from an extrinsic abnormal change affecting calcium homoeostasis stimulating production of parathyroid hormone (secondary hyperparathyroidism). Primary hyperparathyroidism is the third most common endocrine disorder, with the highest incidence in postmenopausal women. Asymptomatic disease is common, and severe disease with renal stones and metabolic bone disease arises less frequently now than it did 20–30 years ago. Primary hyperparathyroidism can be cured by surgical removal of an adenoma, increasingly by minimally invasive parathyroidectomy. Medical management of mild disease is possible with bisphosphonates, hormone replacement therapy, and calcimimetics. Vitamin D deficiency is a common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism, particularly in elderly people. However, the biochemical definition of vitamin D deficiency and its treatment are subject to much debate. Secondary hyperparathyroidism as the result of chronic kidney disease is important in the genesis of renal bone disease, and several new treatments could help achieve the guidelines set out by the kidney disease outcomes quality initiative.

Introduction

A common endocrine condition called primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), which affects calcium metabolism, causes mild or asymptomatic hypercalcemia and high or inappropriately normal parathormone (PTH) levels. However, normocalcemic individuals also exhibit PHPT. Normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism (nPHPT) is a form of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) where the patient has normal levels of calcium in the blood but elevated levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH). This condition can be challenging to diagnose because it lacks the classic symptom of hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels) typically associated with primary hyperparathyroidism. Normal serum calcium levels and ionised calcium levels, as well as the absence of secondary hyperparathyroidism, are characteristics of normocalcemic nPHPT.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a condition where increased PTH secretion is a compensatory response to other physiological conditions. To accurately diagnose nPHPT, secondary causes must be ruled out. The most common causes include vitamin D deficiency, renal insufficiency, malabsorption syndromes, and other metabolic disorders. Diagnosing normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism requires careful exclusion of all potential secondary causes of elevated PTH. A comprehensive laboratory evaluation that includes tests for vitamin D levels, renal function, phosphate levels, and other relevant metabolic parameters is essential.

PHPT results from inappropriate PTH secretion from one or more of the four parathyroid glands. The majority of PHPT patients (80%) have a single adenoma, although in 20% of cases, PHPT patients also have multiple adenomas (10%), four gland hyperplasia (10%), or parathyroid cancer (1%).

One of the key issues for PHPT patients is their skeletal health. One characteristic of PHPT is high bone turnover, which favors bone resorption over bone formation. A high or excessive excretion of PTH is associated with this fast bone turnover. Despite the substantial bone turnover anticipated as a result of this, just a slight decline in bone mineral density (BMD) is often seen. Contradictions do, however, arise amongst the various skeleton locations.

While a relative bone preservation is seen at the spine, a more pronounced impairment is typically seen in cortical sites like the radius, and to a lesser extent, at the femur. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that trabecular bone impairment can also happen in non-weight-bearing sites, emphasising the protective nature of mechanical loading on trabecular bone. Finally, the duration and severity of the PTH excess determine how severe this bone impairment is.

CKD-MBD treatment — abnormal parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels: In patients with CKD G3a–G5 not on dialysis, the optimal PTH level is not known. However, we suggest that patients with levels of intact PTH progressively rising or persistently above the upper normal limit for the assay be evaluated for modifiable factors, including hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, high phosphate intake, and vitamin D deficiency (2C). In adult patients with CKD G3a–G5 not on dialysis, we suggest that calcitriol and vitamin D analogs not be routinely used (2C). It is reasonable to reserve the use of calcitriol and vitamin D analogs for patients with CKD G4–G5 with severe and progressive hyperparathyroidism (Not Graded). In children, calcitriol and vitamin D analogs may be considered to maintain serum calcium levels in the age-appropriate normal range (Not Graded).

### Effects of age and serum 25-OH-vitamin D on serum parathyroid hormone levels [^6324e56f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Several studies define optimal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels based on serum PTH level reaching an asymptote. However, results differ widely, ranging from 25-OHD levels of 12–44 ng/ml: many studies are constrained by small sample size.

Objective

The objective of the study was to determine the relationship between serum PTH and 25-OHD levels and age in a very large reference laboratory database.

Design

This was a detailed cross-sectional analysis of 312,962 paired serum PTH and 25-OHD levels measured from July 2010 to June 2011.

Results

Median PTH levels and the proportion of patients (PTH > 65 pg/ml), from 63 successive 25-OHD frequency classes of 5000 patients, provide smooth, exceptionally well-fitted curves (R(2) = 0.994 and R(2) = 0.995, respectively) without discernible inflection points or asymptotes but with striking age dependencies. Serum 25-OHD was below the recent Institute of Medicine sufficiency guidance of 20 ng/ml in 27% (85,000) of the subjects. More importantly, 40 and 51% of subjects (serum 25-OHD < 20 and 10 ng/ml, respectively) had biochemical hyperparathyroidism (PTH > 65 pg/ml).

Conclusions

This analysis, despite inevitable inherent limitations, introduces several clinical implications. First, median 25-OHD-dependent PTH levels revealed no threshold above which increasing 25-OHD fails to further suppress PTH. Second, the large number of subjects with 25-OHD deficiency and hyperparathyroidism reinforces the Third International Workshop on Asymptomatic Primary Hyper parathyroidism's recommendations to test for, and replete, vitamin D depletion before considering parathyroidectomy. Third, strong age dependency of the PTH-25-OHD relationship likely reflects the composite effects of age-related decline in calcium absorption and renal function. Finally, this unselected large population database study could guide clinical management of patients based on an age-dependent, PTH-25-OHD continuum.

Discussion

PTH, in conjunction with vitamin D and calcitonin, plays a crucial role in the regulation of calcium and phosphate distribution within the skeletal system, as well as in the facilitation of calcium absorption in the intestines and phosphate excretion through the kidneys. The concentration of calcium in the body exerts regulatory control over PTH secretion. Furthermore, vitamin D deficiency is associated with an abnormal increase in PTH levels, which in turn enhances calcium absorption in the intestines. The association between reduced vitamin D activity and diabetes mellitus has been established in epidemiological studies. This theory posits that people with hyperglycemia often exhibit elevated PTH levels. Given the high sensitivity of PTH to fluctuations in blood calcium and phosphorus levels, the presence of normal levels of these minerals significantly reduces the likelihood of PTH pathology. Yu and colleagues discovered that baseline PTH, rather than calcium or vitamin D levels, is the most accurate predictor of negative outcomes in untreated PHPT during long-term follow-up. Therefore, we suggest that elevated PTH levels may serve as a reliable prognostic indicator for diabetics within a non-PHPT population exhibiting normal PTH levels, calcium levels, and phosphorus metabolism.

### Normocalcaemic, vitamin D-sufficient hyperparathyroidism-high prevalence and low morbidity in the general population: a long-term follow-up study, the WHO MONICA project, gothenburg, Sweden [^59970a52]. Clinical Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

No increase in the incidence of kidney stones, fractures, myocardial infarction (OR = 1·99, 95%CI 0·65–11·18; P = 0·16) or stroke (OR = 1·41, 95%CI 0·45–4·47; P = 0·56) during life or in mortality rates after 2008 was found in subjects with nHPT compared with subjects with normal S‐PTH.

Hypercalcaemia at the cross‐sectional analyses in 2008

In 2008, 14 subjects with sufficient vitamin D levels (S‐25(OH)D range 56–133; median 85 nmol/l) had elevated S‐Ca levels and normal S‐PTH. None had thiazide treatment, and four had calcium/vitamin D supplementation. One woman underwent surgery for mammary cancer; otherwise no malignancies were known. One of these individuals had nHPT in 1995 (mentioned above with specification of analysis results), and the others had normal S‐PTH and S‐Ca levels at that time. Six subjects of the 14 (43%) with hypercalcaemia and normal S‐PTH had sustained fractures (ns compared with nHPT). Two subjects with hypercalcaemia had S‐PTH 56 and 58 ng/l and should probably be considered as pHPT. The remaining 12 subjects with hypercalcaemia had S‐PTH levels between 21 and 43 ng/l. Three subjects, besides the 14, had pHPT (hypercalcaemia and elevated S‐PTH). Should the definition of pHPT be hypercalcaemia with measurable S‐PTH, then the prevalence would be 4·1% in the age span of 38–79 years. The linear correlation between S‐Ca and S‐PTH in subjects with and without vitamin D insufficiency is shown in Fig. 2.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism: should surgery be performed on all patients? Current evidence and residual uncertainties [^a85e6b7e]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is the third most common endocrine disease and is characterized by hypercalcaemia and elevated or inappropriately 'normal' levels of the parathyroid hormone (PTH). The main target organs of PTH are the skeletal system and the kidneys. Before the 1970s, pHPT was a rarely detected disease associated with notable morbidity and premature mortality. Introduction of biochemical screening, allowing for a wide range of indications, has contributed to the detection of the full spectrum of the disease. A new entity with an isolated elevation of PTH, normocalcaemic HP, has emerged and is currently being explored. The highest incidence of pHPT, 3–5%, is observed amongst women, and the prevalence increases with age. The female-to-male ratio is 3–4: 1 except in younger patients where distribution is equal and known hereditary causes account for approximately 10% of the cases. In the last few decades, it has become evident that fewer patients than previously believed are truly asymptomatic. The cause of pHPT is often a benign tumour, a parathyroid adenoma, and the only definite treatment is parathyroidectomy (PTX). No medical treatment, single or combined, can achieve a curing of pHPT. Recent data indicate that PTX, despite being proven to be cost-effective compared to conservative treatment, is underutilized, especially in elderly pHPT patients. The decision of PTX should always be based on a safe diagnosis, and the potential benefits of curative treatment should not be outweighed by the risks of surgery or anaesthesia.

### Is serum phosphorus control related to parathyroid hormone control in dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism? [^e05aca8f]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is accompanied by progressively impaired metabolism of calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D, eventually leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), a clinical syndrome of abnormal mineral and bone metabolism and extraskeletal calcifications that is associated with an increased risk of bone fractures, cardiovascular morbidity and death.

As elevated serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), phosphorus and calcium have all been linked with increased morbidity and mortality in dialysis (CKD stage 5D) patients, the National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-K/DOQI™ [KDOQI TM) in 2003 recommended stringent targets for intact PTH (iPTH; 150–300 pg/mL), calcium (8.4–9.5 mg/dL) and phosphorus (3.5–5.5 mg/dL) for this population of patients. With increasing awareness of the key contribution of elevated serum phosphorus to vascular calcification and cardiovascular morbidity, more recent guidelines from the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) group have highlighted the importance of tight control of serum phosphorus and calcium. KDIGO suggest that levels as close to normal as possible should be aimed for in dialysis patients and that the choice of pharmacological treatment should be influenced by these parameters.

### Hypovitaminosis D masking hypercalcemia in primary hyperparathyroidism: case report [^b1c5189d]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypovitaminosis D or vitamin D deficiency is defined as serum vitamin D levels below 20 ng/mL, while levels below 10 or 12 ng/mL are considered severe deficiency. Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is around 40% while severe deficiency is 13% in Europe. Severe vitamin D deficiency is associated with the risk of osteomalacia presenting as diffuse bone pain and tenderness. Biochemically, it is characterized by low or low normal serum calcium, phosphorus, and secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (HPTH) is common occurring in up to 82 cases per 100,000 people. It is characterized by normocalcemia or variable degrees of hypercalcemia associated with high or inappropriately normal parathormone (PTH). More than 80% are asymptomatic, however, up to 63% have osteopenia/osteoporosis and up to 20% have nephrolithiasis/nephrocalcinosis.

Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) is a rare autosomal dominant benign cause of hypercalcemia. It is characterized by mild early-onset hypercalcemia, unsuppressed, or, in a quarter of patients, high PTH. It is differentiated from primary HPTH by a characteristic low urinary calcium excretion.

In this report, when hypovitaminosis D – an essentially hypocalcemic state – and primary HPTH – an essentially hypercalcemic state – are combined in the same patient, this will modify the initial presentation and cause a rethinking of the differential diagnosis in the course of managing this patient.

### Dynamics of parathyroid hormone secretion in health and secondary hyperparathyroidism [^5aa9a2f9]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

This review examines the dynamics of parathyroid hormone secretion in health and in various causes of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Although most studies of parathyroid hormone and calcium have focused on the modification of parathyroid hormone secretion by serum calcium, the relationship between parathyroid hormone and serum calcium is bifunctional because parathyroid hormone also modifies serum calcium. In normal animals and humans, factors such as phosphorus and vitamin D modify the basal parathyroid hormone level and the maximal parathyroid hormone response to hypocalcemia. Certain medications, such as lithium and estrogen, in normal individuals and sustained changes in the serum calcium concentration in hemodialysis patients change the set point of calcium, which reflects the serum calcium concentration at which parathyroid hormone secretion responds. Hypocalcemia increases the basal/maximal parathyroid hormone ratio, a measure of the relative degree of parathyroid hormone stimulation. The phenomenon of hysteresis, defined as a different parathyroid hormone value for the same serum calcium concentration during the induction of and recovery from hypo- and hypercalcemia, is discussed because it provides important insights into factors that affect parathyroid hormone secretion. In three causes of secondary hyperparathyroidism — chronic kidney disease, vitamin D deficiency, and aging — factors that affect the dynamics of parathyroid hormone secretion are evaluated in detail. During recovery from vitamin D deficiency, the maximal parathyroid hormone remains elevated while the basal parathyroid hormone value rapidly becomes normal because of a shift in the set point of calcium. Much remains to be learned about the dynamics of parathyroid hormone secretion in health and secondary hyperparathyroidism.

### Bone in parathyroid diseases revisited: evidence from epidemiological, surgical and new drug outcomes [^158173b6]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

The initial diagnostic workup of hyperparathyroidism should be focused on excluding causes of SHPT (eg, kidney failure, vitamin D deficiency, treatment with diuretics). Biochemical evaluation is needed to confirm the diagnosis of PHPT. However, the disorder may appear with a vast range of biochemical profiles, thus complicating the diagnosis. The classic biochemical presentation of PHPT is characterized by elevated serum calcium levels along with inappropriately increased PTH levels. Elevated serum calcium levels and inappropriately normal PTH levels are characteristics of the variant known as normohormonal PHPT (up to 20% of the cases). A third variant is normocalcemic PHPT (NPHPT), which is defined by persistently elevated serum PTH levels and normal total and ionized calcium levels, in the absence of secondary causes. Classic hypercalcemic PHPT (HPHPT) may follow NPHPT, as a number of these patients may develop hypercalcemia over time. It is crucial to differentiate PHPT from the genetic disorder of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH), as biochemical tests, such as serum calcium, PTH, and phosphate levels often overlap, whereas management approaches differ significantly; the gold standard in the management of PHPT is surgery, in opposition to FHH, where PTX fails to lower calcium levels and generally is contraindicated. Calcium excretion is usually elevated in PHPT and may predispose in nephrolithiasis. Calcium-creatinine clearance ratio is used to distinguish the 2 disorders, with the majority of cases with FHH and PHPT having a clearance ratio of < 0.01 and > 0.02, respectively. Between 0.01 and 0.02 can be found in approximately 40% of people with either condition.

### Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and genetics of primary hyperparathyroidism [^cc3a1e96]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The source of the increase in serum Ca ++ varies depending on the severity of the hypercalcemia. In mild‐to‐moderate disease, both an increase in bone resorption and postprandial calcitriol‐mediated intestinal calcium hyperabsorption contribute to the hypercalcemia (Table 2). Intestinal calcium transport, which largely takes place in the proximal intestine, occurs by both transcellular and paracellular pathways. The transcellular pathway is a tightly regulated pathway and is increased by 1,25(OH) 2 vitamin D. The paracellular pathway can also be regulated by modulation of tight junction proteins such as claudin 2 and claudin12. Expression of both claudins is increased by 1,25(OH) 2 vitamin D thereby augmenting paracellular calcium transport. The increase in distal tubular calcium reabsorption plays a greater role in sustaining the hypercalcemia than intestinal calcium absorption. In the typical patient with mild to moderate PHPT, plasma calcium and PTH levels can remain stable for years and when the hypercalcemia is mild (ie, less than 11.0 mg/dL [2.75 mmol/L]) patients often have relatively few symptoms. When the hypercalcemia is more severe, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, muscle weakness, and impaired mentation can occur. Rarely a patient may experience sudden worsening of PHPT, so called parathyroid storm or acute hyperparathyroidism. Although PTH lowers the renal phosphate threshold, frank hypophosphatemia is uncommon in most cases of PHPT. Low‐normal phosphate values are commonly seen in PHPT, although it is not as reliable a finding as hypercalcemia. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is elevated in patients with PHPT and correlates positively with serum calcium and PTH and negatively with levels of serum phosphorus and 1,25(OH) 2 vitamin D. However, in a multiple regression analysis only serum calcium and creatinine clearance were predictors of FGF23, and serum levels of FGF23 did not change after curative surgery, suggesting that this hormone is not likely to play a major role in mediating the hypophosphatemia seen in PHPT. Vitamin D deficiency is also frequently seen in PHPT and can exacerbate its severity.

Because, as just noted, the more well‐established consequences of dysregulated parathyroid function are covered elsewhere in this series, the remainder of this section is devoted to selected new and emerging aspects of the pathophysiology of PHPT as well as to areas of uncertainty.

### Elevations in serum and urinary calcium with parathyroid hormone (1–84) with and without alendronate for osteoporosis [^04ab2121]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Context

The effect of PTH therapy on serum and urinary calcium levels and the risk of hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria has not been formally evaluated.

Objective

The objective was to examine changes in serum and urinary calcium associated with PTH(1–84) therapy in the PaTH trial and the extent to which a defined algorithm resolved the elevated values.

Design, Setting, Participants, and Intervention

A total of 178 postmenopausal women were randomized to PTH(1–84) either alone or in combination with alendronate during the first year of the PaTH study.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

The main outcome measures were fasting serum calcium at baseline and 1, 3, and 12 months and 24-h urinary calcium at baseline and 3 months.

Results

In 14% of participants, serum calcium more than 10.5 mg/dl (> 2.6 mmol/liter) developed. Following the defined algorithm, 58% of elevated measurements were normal on repeat testing; 38% required discontinuation of calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and one necessitated a decrease in PTH injection frequency to normalize serum calcium. One participant developed transient hypercalcemia between study visits and required hospitalization; the episode resolved with iv hydration and PTH discontinuation. Baseline characteristics associated with the development of hypercalcemia were serum calcium [relative hazards = 1.9 per 0.5 mg/dl (0.12 mmol/liter); 95% confidence interval = 1.1–3.2] and serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [relative hazard = 1.9 per 10 pg/ml (26 pmol/liter); 95% confidence interval = 1.2–3.1]. Fifteen women (8%) developed hypercalciuria [urinary calcium > 400 mg (100 mmol)/24 h or calcium/creatinine ratio > 0.4]; 80% of cases resolved after discontinuing calcium and vitamin D, 13% without intervention, and one after PTH injection frequency was decreased. Higher baseline urinary calcium excretion was associated with development of hypercalciuria [relative hazard = 1.5 per 50 mg/d (12.5 mmol/d); 95% confidence interval = 1.2–4.0]. Proportions of patients with elevated serum and urinary calcium were similar on single and combination therapy.

Conclusions

The frequency of episodic hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria in the PaTH trial was 21%. Episodes were generally mild, and nearly all cases resolved spontaneously or with discontinuation of calcium and vitamin D. The algorithms used to address hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria in the PaTH trial proved effective in safely resolving clinical episodes of increased urinary or serum calcium and might therefore be helpful to clinicians caring for patients on PTH.

### Evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism: summary statement and guidelines from the fifth international workshop [^820553dd]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for primary hyperparathyroidism, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, PHPT-IW-5 2022 guidelines recommend to diagnose normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism by confirming normal adjusted total calcium and normal ionized calcium levels along with elevated intact PTH levels, using either a second or third generation assay, on at least two occasions over 3–6 months after excluding all alternative causes for secondary hyperparathyroidism.

### Normocalcaemic, vitamin D-sufficient hyperparathyroidism-high prevalence and low morbidity in the general population: a long-term follow-up study, the WHO MONICA project, gothenburg, Sweden [^e0a9e908]. Clinical Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The serum intact parathyroid hormone (S‐PTH) assay was introduced in the early 1990s and facilitated the diagnosis of primary hypercalcaemic hyperparathyroidism (pHPT). 1 In the past, patients with pHPT were commonly severely symptomatic at the time of diagnosis due to bone loss and kidney stones. Today the high availability of serum calcium (S‐Ca) and S‐PTH analyses facilitates earlier diagnosis, and the patients are often asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. 2 In our clinical experience, the analyses of S‐PTH have increased in recent years – irrespective of calcium aberrations – in the evaluation of patients with, for example, metabolic bone disease. A new group of patients has thereby been discovered, characterized by normal S‐Ca and elevated S‐PTH levels in the absence of vitamin D deficiency, renal disease or medications, which elevate S‐PTH. This diagnostic entity has been named normocalcaemic primary HPT (nHPT). 2, 3, 4 No official recommendations for the follow‐up and treatment of nHPT have been established due to the scarcity of data on the prevalence, natural history and outcome of medical or surgical management. Specialists in the field monitor patients with nHPT similarly as they monitor patients with asymptomatic mild pHPT. 2, 3

The natural history of long‐standing nHPT and the rate of progression into pHPT are poorly known. 5 Most studies including S‐PTH have been performed on referral groups of patients, mostly to bone and metabolic units. 6, 7 In addition, it is uncertain which S‐Ca level could be considered safe in patients with mild pHPT. 8 pHPT increases both fracture risk through bone loss and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. There is also an association between higher S‐PTH levels (within the normal range) and cardiovascular mortality in the absence of calcium aberrations and vitamin D deficiency. 9, 10

This study evaluates both the progression rate of nHPT into pHPT and the cardiovascular and skeletal morbidity in a random population sample without referral bias. We analyse S‐PTH levels in relation to variables of calcium homeostasis, other hormone levels, body composition, medication, bone characteristics and blood pressure, with a follow‐up of end‐points (fractures, myocardial infarction, stroke and mortality) after 17 years. The hypothesis was that nHPT in vitamin D‐sufficient subjects was associated with an increased risk of fractures and/or cardiovascular disease and could progress to pHPT.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^66dea13c]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To review primary hyperparathyroidism and the key issues that are relevant to the practicing endocrinologist.

Methods

The latest information on the presentation, diagnosis, and traditional and nontraditional aspects of primary hyperparathyroidism is reviewed.

Results

The diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism is straightforward when the traditional hypercalcemic patient is documented to have an elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. Commonly, patients are identified who have normal serum calcium levels but elevated PTH levels in whom no secondary causes for hyperparathyroidism can be confirmed. Traditional target organs of primary hyperparathyroidism-the skeleton and the kidneys-continue to be a focus in the patient evaluation. Bone mineral density shows a typical pattern of involvement with the distal one-third radius being selectively reduced compared with the lumbar spine in which bone mineral density is generally well maintained. Neurocognitive and cardiovascular aspects of primary hyperparathyroidism, while a focus of recent interest, have not been shown to definitively aid in the decision for or against surgery. The recommendation for surgery in primary hyperparathyroidism is based on guidelines that focus on the serum calcium level, renal function, bone mineral density, and age. In patients who do not meet guidelines, a nonsurgical management approach has merit.

Conclusions

Primary hyperparathyroidism is continuing to show changes in its clinical profile, with normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism being a topic of great interest. Skeletal and renal features of primary hyperparathyroidism drive, in most cases, the decision to recommend surgery. In patients who do not meet any criteria for surgery, a conservative approach with appropriate monitoring is acceptable.

### Relationship between vitamin D, calcium and parathyroid hormone in cape town [^e9389398]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Aim

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency is associated with abnormal levels of calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH).

Methods

Vitamin D requests at a tertiary hospital in South Africa over 2 years were retrospectively analysed along with calcium and PTH levels.

Results

Only when the 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level dropped below 25 nmol/l, was there a significant rise in PTH. A subnormal 25(OH)D level was also not always related to hypocalcaemia, as more than half of patients with their 25(OH)D level below 25 nmol/l had calcium levels in the reference range. However, all patients with calcium levels below 1.8 mmol/l were shown to have vitamin D insufficiency.

Conclusion

Hypovitaminosis D may co-exist with a blunted PTH response. Therefore, assumptions about vitamin D status should not be made based on PTH and calcium values. 25(OH)D measurements should be requested when vitamin D deficiency is clinically suspected, irrespective of biochemical results.

### Parathyroid disorders [^1833c46a]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Disorders of the parathyroid glands most commonly present with abnormalities of serum calcium. Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, the most common cause of hypercalcemia in outpatients, are often asymptomatic or may have bone disease, nephrolithiasis, or neuromuscular symptoms. Patients with chronic kidney disease may develop secondary hyperparathyroidism with resultant chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder. Hypoparathyroidism most often occurs after neck surgery; it can also be caused by autoimmune destruction of the glands and other less common problems. Evaluation of patients with abnormal serum calcium levels includes a history and physical examination; repeat measurement of serum calcium level; and measurement of creatinine, magnesium, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone levels. The treatment for symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism is parathyroidectomy. Management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism includes monitoring symptoms; serum calcium and creatinine levels; and bone mineral density. Patients with hypoparathyroidism require close monitoring and vitamin D (e.g., calcitriol) replacement.

### The 2011 report on dietary reference intakes for calcium and vitamin D from the institute of medicine: what clinicians need to know [^2c7537a3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Serum 25OHD Levels and Screening

Guidelines regarding the use of serum markers of vitamin D status for medical management of individual patients and for screening were beyond the scope of the Committee's charge, and evidence-based consensus guidelines are not available. However, these issues should be addressed by appropriate federal agencies and professional organizations in light of the findings in this report. As noted above, the Committee recognized that serum 25OHD is a useful integrated marker of vitamin D exposure, incorporating endogenous synthesis from solar exposure, dietary intake from foods, fortified products, and/or supplements, and other factors. However, the Committee also recognized that observational studies of correlations between 25OHD and clinical outcomes are subject to confounding and do not prove causation. Concerns about inaccurate or imprecise serum 25OHD measurements are being overcome by methodological advances, frequent quality assessments, and accurate calibration tools. In contrast, serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D represents a more complex endocrine parameter, regulated by calcium and PTH status and affected by kidney function. After a careful review of available literature, the Committee concluded that serum 25OHD levels of 16 ng/ml (40 nmol/liter) cover the requirements of approximately half the population, and levels of 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/liter) cover the requirements of at least 97.5% of the population. These levels will be useful to clinicians as they consider management of patients under their care. For upper levels of serum 25OHD, sparse data are available, particularly regarding long-term effects of chronically high concentrations, and a margin of safety for public health recommendations is prudent. Thus, serum 25OHD levels above 50 ng/ml (125 nmol/liter) should raise concerns among clinicians about potential adverse effects.

### Normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism: study of its prevalence and natural history [^08ca568f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism (NPHPT) is a disorder of calcium metabolism that, despite being mentioned in the literature for several years, was officially defined only in 2009, during the Third International Workshop on Asymptomatic Primary Hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). According to the latest guidelines, persistently normal calcium levels (total and ionized) and consistently elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) values characterize NPHPT. The panel suggested that normal calcium has to be confirmed on several occasions and that an elevated PTH measurement should be confirmed on at least 2 consecutive measurements. Other causes of secondary hyperparathyroidism have to be excluded; these include medications known to affect PTH levels (diuretics, lithium, denosumab, bisphosphonates, anticonvulsants, and phosphorus), low vitamin D, chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2), renal calcium loss (hypercalciuria) and diseases of the gastrointestinal tract known to affect calcium absorption (celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and bariatric surgery).

NPHPT is usually encountered during the laboratory evaluation of osteoporosis and has been associated with consequences known to affect patients with PHPT (accelerated bone loss, kidney stones, higher levels of blood pressure, and higher preexisting glucose intolerance). However, there is no clear evidence for any such associations.

The prevalence of NPHPT in the literature varies considerably, and it is reported to be between 0.1% and 8.9%. The reasons for this variation are that different definitions and methodologies were used in the reported studies; not all causes of secondary hyperparathyroidism were excluded, and some studies did not test the persistence of high PTH and normal calcium before evaluating the prevalence; thus the results were probably overestimated.

The data on the natural history of this disease are also sparse and inconclusive. Some studies show progression to hypercalcemia, but others do not. The way that many studies identify NPHPT patients is by testing calcium and PTH at baseline, and retesting after some time to check whether they progressed to hypercalcemia. The variability of calcium in NPHPT during the follow-up period has been poorly described. One study has described the variability as similar to the normal population, whereas patients with PHPT have been described to have more considerable variability in calcium levels. However, there are not enough data to draw any conclusions.

### Does higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels will harm bone mineral density? a cross-sectional study [^c0182fd9]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin D is integral to maintaining bone health and calcium homeostasis. Vitamin D, in its active form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)₂D], binds to the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in various tissues, facilitating calcium and phosphate absorption in the intestines and promoting bone mineralization. It also regulates parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, essential for calcium balance. Insufficiency of vitamin D results in diminished calcium absorption, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and heightened bone resorption, potentially leading to compromised bone integrity and an increased susceptibility to osteoporosis and fractures. Bone mineral density (BMD) is recognized as the most important predictor of osteoporosis, and fracture is the ultimate manifestation. Epidemiologic studies have shown that a 10% increase in PBM at the population level reduces the risk of fracture later in life by 50%.

However, observational studies have yielded varying conclusions regarding the relationship between vitamin D levels and bone mineral density (BMD). Some studies suggest that vitamin D supplementation does not prevent fractures or falls nor has a clinically meaningful effect on bone mineral density. The discussion persists regarding the optimal levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D necessary for achieving the highest possible skeletal health outcomes. Indeed, there does not appear to be a causal relationship between higher 25(OH)D concentrations and higher BMD in the general healthy population. Furthermore, a weak relationship between serum 25(OH)D and bone microarchitecture was observed in a population with a mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level as high as 137 nmol/L.

This inconsistency in findings highlights the complexity of the relationship between vitamin D and bone health. It suggests the possibility of a U-shaped association, where both low and high levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D may be associated with adverse bone health outcomes. Such a pattern would imply an optimal range for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, within which bone mineral density is maximized, and deviations on either side could lead to reduced bone health. This study aims to clarify these relationships by examining a large, nationally representative sample of adults in the US, using data from NHANES collected between 2011 and 2018.

### Diagnosis of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: proceedings of the fourth international workshop [^6ac03dcd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common clinical problem. The purpose of this report is to provide an update on the use of diagnostic tests for this condition in clinical practice.

Participants

This subgroup was constituted by the Steering Committee to address key questions related to the diagnosis of PHPT. Consensus was established at a closed meeting of the Expert Panel that followed.

Evidence

Each question was addressed by a relevant literature search (on PubMed), and the data were presented for discussion at the group meeting.

Consensus Process

Consensus was achieved by a group meeting. Statements were prepared by all authors, with comments relating to accuracy from the diagnosis subgroup and by representatives from the participating professional societies.

Conclusions

We conclude that: 1) reference ranges should be established for serum PTH in vitamin D-replete healthy individuals; 2) second- and third-generation PTH assays are both helpful in the diagnosis of PHPT; 3) normocalcemic PHPT is a variant of the more common presentation of PHPT with hypercalcemia; 4) serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations should be measured and, if vitamin D insufficiency is present, it should be treated as part of any management course; 5) genetic testing has the potential to be useful in the differential diagnosis of familial hyperparathyroidism or hypercalcemia.

### Persistent elevation of parathyroid hormone after curative parathyroidectomy: a risk factor for recurrent hyperparathyroidism [^c1416e78]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Up to 45% of patients may have persistently elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels after curative parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), although the clinical significance is unclear. We aimed to assess the long-term clinical significance of persistently elevated PTH early after parathyroidectomy.

Methods

A prospectively collected institutional database was queried for patients who underwent parathyroidectomy for sporadic PHPT between 12/99 and 6/22 and had normal serum calcium levels at 6 months postoperatively. Demographic and clinical data were collected, including diagnoses associated with secondary HPT (gastrointestinal malabsorptive diseases, kidney disease, and vitamin D deficiency). Patients were divided into two groups: normal PTH or elevated PTH at 6 months postoperatively. The rate of persistently elevated PTH, average time to PTH normalization, and time to recurrence were determined.

Results

The final cohort included 1146 patients; 849 (91%) had normal PTH levels and 194 (17%) had early postoperative normocalcemia with elevated PTH at 6 months postoperatively. Among 194 patients (mean follow-up: 50 ± 53 months), 14 (7.2%) developed recurrent pHPT and 86 (44.3%) had normalization of PTH levels (median time to normalization: 12 months) (IQR: 9 and 15). There was no difference in the presence of diagnoses associated with secondary HPT between patients who had recurrent PHPT, normalization of PTH levels, or remained normocalcemic with persistently elevated PTH levels. The median time to recurrence was 22 months (IQR: 11 and 48) for the 7.2% of patients who developed recurrent PHPT compared to 2.4% in the 849 patients with normal calcium and PTH levels at 6 months (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Following curative parathyroidectomy, persistent elevation of PTH levels is not uncommon. Although most patients have a durable cure, it may be an early sign of persistent/recurrent PHPT. Long-term surveillance for recurrence is necessary.

### Secondary hyperparathyroidism in primary osteoporosis and osteopenia: optimizing calcium and vitamin D intakes to levels recommended by expert panels may not be sufficient for correction [^5aca2613]. Clinical Endocrinology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare biochemical variables, renal function and calcium and vitamin D intakes in euparathyroid and hyperparathyroid patients with primary osteoporosis and osteopenia and describe the measures necessary to normalize serum PTH in the patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Design and Patients

We reviewed the charts of normocalcemic patients with primary osteoporosis and osteopenia first seen during the years 1991–2003 and identified 75 with elevated serum PTH levels at baseline. These patients were compared to all the 143 euparathyroid patients first seen in 1998 and 1999. Patients were restudied after 1 year and we attempted to follow patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism until PTH levels became normal.

Measurements

At baseline serum PTH, ionized calcium, inorganic phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, a complete blood count and serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D were measured in the early morning fasting state. These tests were repeated at follow up.

Results

In one-third of the hyperparathyroid patients, the standard baseline treatment failed to correct the secondary hyperparathyroidism necessitating extraordinary measures including unusually large doses of vitamin D (i.e. 50 000 IU vitamin D(2) twice weekly) or the substitution of calcium citrate for calcium carbonate as a calcium supplement.

Conclusion

Large doses of vitamin D are frequently necessary to suppress secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with primary osteoporosis and osteopenia. This suggests that vitamin D metabolism may be altered in some of these patients.

### Determination of reference intervals for serum total calcium in the vitamin D-replete pediatric population [^5c512939]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Here we report age-adjusted reference intervals for total serum calcium concentration based on apparently normal subjects with vitamin D sufficiency. Similar to previous studies, we found that serum calcium levels were greatest in younger subjects, and that the upper limits of the reference ranges declined with age. We found that at all ages, the lower limit of the reference intervals for normal subjects with vitamin D sufficiency [ie, 25(OH)D levels greater than 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/L)] were significantly greater (P < .001) than those for unselected subjects. By contrast, the upper limit of these reference ranges did not vary between groups defined by vitamin D status. Hence, the reference intervals for serum calcium that we have determined likely reflect a more physiologically appropriate reference interval, rather than a reference range based on values from an unselected population that includes many subjects with vitamin D insufficiency. That is, the increase in precision in the normal range of serum calcium actually reflects an increase in accuracy. Our observations suggest that many subjects with 25(OH)D levels less than 30 ng/mL have mild hypocalcemia. We did not observe a relationship between 25(OH)D and higher levels of total serum calcium, consistent with the notion that within the physiological range, levels of 25(OH)D do not lead to higher concentrations of serum calcium in patients with intact parathyroid gland function. Most importantly, our results indicate that inclusion of patients with low serum levels of 25(OH)D has a significant impact on the determination of reference ranges for serum calcium.

Our studies also addressed the ongoing controversy in the field of vitamin D biology concerning the definition of vitamin D deficiency. Several attempts to define the lower limit of the normal range for 25(OH)D have relied on population data showing an increase in serum levels of PTH when serum levels of 25(OH)D are less than 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L). Mortality data, as well as the difficulty in determining the inflection point of the PTH curve, have limited acceptance of these results, however. Based on other studies, some authorities have proposed that a serum concentration of 25(OH)D less than 20 ng/dL represents a state of vitamin D deficiency. Our data indicate that many patients with serum 25(OH)D concentrations between 20 and 30 ng/mL have mildly depressed serum calcium levels and thereby support the premise that 30 ng/mL represents a more valid lower physiological limit.

Secondary osteoporosis evaluation — postmenopausal women with osteoporosis: An appropriate medical evaluation is indicated in all women with postmenopausal osteoporosis and at high fracture risk, and because causes are common even in apparently healthy women, laboratory testing should be considered for all women with osteoporosis; simple tests provided useful information in 40 to 85% of women without clinical evidence of secondary osteoporosis. Baseline laboratory evaluation should include a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D), intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), phosphate, and a 24-hour urine collection for calcium, sodium, and creatinine; the 24-hour urine calcium collection must occur after vitamin D repletion and while on a reasonable calcium intake (1,000 to 1,200 mg/d) for at least 2 weeks. If medical history, exam, or initial labs suggest causes of secondary osteoporosis, additional laboratory evaluation is warranted and may include, but is not limited to, tests listed in Table 13; if the patient is receiving thyroid hormone or there is a suspicion for hyperthyroidism, thyroid-stimulating hormone should also be obtained, and celiac antibodies or serum/urine protein electrophoresis could also be obtained.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by an elevation in parathyroid hormone (PTH) associated with inadequate levels of active vitamin D hormone. The source of vitamin D in the body is from synthesis in the skin as vitamin D3and from dietary intake as either vitamin D2or D3. Both vitamin D2and D3require two sequential hydroxylations in the liver and the kidney to bind to and to activate the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The endogenous VDR activator, calcitriol [1,25(OH)2D3], is a hormone that binds to VDRs that are present in the parathyroid gland, intestine, kidney, and bone to maintain parathyroid function and calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, and to VDRs found in many other tissues, including prostate, endothelium and immune cells. VDR activation is essential for the proper formation and maintenance of normal bone. In the diseased kidney, the activation of vitamin D is diminished, resulting in a rise of PTH, subsequently leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism and disturbances in the calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. Decreased levels of 1,25(OH)2D3have been observed in early stages of chronic kidney disease. The decreased levels of 1,25(OH)2D3and resultant elevated PTH levels, both of which often precede abnormalities in serum calcium and phosphorus, affect bone turnover rate and may result in renal osteodystrophy.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Paricalcitol is a synthetic, biologically active vitamin D2analog of calcitriol. Preclinical and in vitro studies have demonstrated that paricalcitol's biological actions are mediated through binding of the VDR, which results in the selective activation of vitamin D responsive pathways. Vitamin D and paricalcitol have been shown to reduce parathyroid hormone levels by inhibiting PTH synthesis and secretion.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: a pragmatic approach [^7af57e8f]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

It is well recognised that over the past three to four decades the incidence of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism has increased significantly. However, more recently this pattern has further evolved into a presentation with normocalcaemia and raised parathyroid hormone (PTH) level without the presence of a recognised stimulus for its rise, in the form of vitamin D deficiency or renal impairment. A diagnostic label of normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism (NPHPT) has been given to this phenotype and in most such individuals, the initial PTH measurement is driven by the presence of metabolic bone disease. The reported prevalence, degree of end-organ involvement and the rate of progression vary considerably and are related to patients studied and the biochemical cut-offs used in its definition. A majority of patients are diagnosed during assessment of metabolic bone disease of varying degrees. Once the diagnosis is confirmed by excluding confounding factors, the patient should undergo full assessment of end-organ involvement, which is the main determinant of further therapeutic decisions. Surgery, with prior localisation, is considered in patients with significant end-organ involvement in keeping with the guidance for hypercalcaemic patients. If a patient does not meet these criteria, annual clinical and biochemical surveillance is recommended to identify progression to hypercalcaemia or worsening end-organ involvement. It is less clear if patients identified during 'routine' requests for evaluation of unrelated symptoms require similar close monitoring. In conclusion, in this review on NPHPT we focus on its definition, planning of further investigations, selection of patients for intervention and devising an appropriate follow-up strategy.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^671227f5]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency–associated hypocalcemia — calcium and calcitriol dosing guidance includes that hypocalcemia should be treated with calcium supplements, with parenteral calcium as calcium gluconate (10–20 mg of elemental calcium per kg intravenously slowly over 5–10 minutes, usually given as 1–2 mL/kg of 10% calcium gluconate) in cases of manifest tetany or convulsions. Recommended doses of elemental calcium are 30 to 75 mg/kg per day in 3 divided doses, and calcitriol may be necessary in doses of 20 to 100 ng/kg per day in 2 to 3 divided doses until calcium levels normalize. High doses of calcium are necessary early in the course of therapy, after which doses are reduced by half for the next 1 to 2 weeks. Once vitamin D is reduced to 400 IU/day with normal PTH and 25(OH)-D levels, calcium supplementation is usually not necessary.

### Hypovitaminosis D masking hypercalcemia in primary hyperparathyroidism: case report [^3dcc81c7]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

The patient was prescribed vitamin D3 200,000 IU ampoules by intramuscular injections, every 2 weeks for 2 months and the tests were reevaluated in December 2012. Vitamin D showed some improvement and rose to 18 ng/mL and calcium rose up to 11.8 mg/dL. The patient repeated the same treatment protocol for two more months and tests were reevaluated once more in March 2013. Vitamin D normalized to 51.4 ng/mL, calcium remained elevated at 11.5 mg/dL, phosphorus low normal at 2.5 mg/dL, and PTH remained high at 161 ng/L. The decision was to stop vitamin D injections and reevaluate in 1 month.

In April 2013, calcium showed persistent elevation at 12.7 mg/dL, low normal phosphorus at 3.2 mg/dL, and PTH persistently elevated at 231 ng/L. At this point, the differential diagnosis was primary HPTH versus FHH. A final laboratory assessment was ordered in May 2013 to reach a definite diagnosis. Normal vitamin D at 65.3 ng/mL, high ionized calcium at 6.4 mg/dL (N: 4.6–5.2), low phosphorus at 2.1 mg/dL, high 24 h urinary calcium excretion at 577 mg/24 h (N: 100–400), and high PTH at 176 ng/L, a combination consistent with primary HPTH that was initially masked by hypovitaminosis D.

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^ab8d8dcf]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

Biochemical characteristics

The biochemical hallmarks of XLH are hypophosphataemia due to renal phosphate wasting, increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels and elevated intact FGF23 levels. A positive family history of XLH, elevated ALP levels, decreased serum phosphate concentrations associated with renal phosphate wasting and/or the identification of a PHEX mutation can help to identify affected children within the first weeks of life. Of note, serum levels of phosphate might be in the normal range within the first 3–4 months of life. Renal phosphate wasting should be evaluated by calculating the tubular maximum reabsorption of phosphate per glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR)(Table 1). In patients with insufficient phosphate intake, or impaired intestinal absorption (which might be suspected by low urinary levels of phosphate), TmP/GFR can be falsely low until serum levels of phosphate are restored to normal. Although, plasma levels of intact FGF23 are usually elevated, normal levels of FGF23 do not exclude XLH but should be interpreted as inappropriately normal in the setting of hypophosphataemia. FGF23 levels are also influenced by other factors, in particular phosphate intake and vitamin D therapy. Therefore, FGF23 levels are most informative in untreated patients. FGF23 levels are elevated in several other forms of hypophosphataemic rickets (Table 2), and the normal range varies considerably according to the assay used. Serum concentrations of calcium are usually in the lower normal range, and urinary calcium is low owing to impaired 1,25(OH) 2 vitamin D synthesis and consequently decreased intestinal calcium absorption. In contrast to calcipenic rickets, parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels are usually at the upper limit of the normal range or even slightly elevated. Circulating levels of 1,25(OH) 2 vitamin D are low or inappropriately normal in the setting of hypophosphataemia.

Resistance to PTH

In patients with PHP1A, resistance to PTH is usually absent at birth and evolves over life (from 0.2 years to 22 years), while the clinical manifestations typically occur later. These data suggest that PTH resistance begins in early childhood, and the resultant changes in serum levels of calcium and phosphorus develop gradually, at some point during adulthood. The first biochemical abnormalities to become apparent are elevated serum levels of PTH and elevated serum levels of phosphorus, followed by hypocalcaemia. When hypocalcaemia is present, urine levels of calcium are low, whereas calcitriol levels might be either low or normal. An interval of up to 4.5 years usually occurs between the start of the elevation in levels of PTH and phosphorus and onset of hypocalcaemia.

Patients with PHP1B might show variable degrees of PTH-resistant hypocalcaemia or normocalcaemia, despite identical epigenetic changes involving transcription start site (TSS)–differentially methylated region (DMR) at exon A/B of GNAS (GNAS A/B :TSS-DMR). Long-standing secondary hyperparathyroidism with chronic hypocalcaemia and calcitriol deficiency has been associated with tertiary hyperparathyroidism in these patients. Chronically elevated levels of PTH might also lead to bone resorption and demineralization that resemble the bone changes seen in rickets in children with irregular and widened metaphyses, Madelung-like deformity or primary hyperparathyroidism, including brown tumours (a bone lesion that can occur when osteoclast activity due to hyperparathyroidism is excessive).

Resistance to PTH is also present in patients with mutations in PRKAR1A,; however, hypocalcaemia has not been documented in these patients yet. Patients with PDE4D mutations usually display normal levels of PTH, except in the context of calcifediol deficiency.

Recommendations

1.7. The definition of PTH resistance is as follows:
The association of hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia and elevated serum levels of PTH in the absence of vitamin D deficiency and when magnesium levels and renal function are normal.
PTH resistance in the context of PHP and related disorders should be suspected when PTH is at, or above, the upper limit of normal, in the presence of normal calcifediol levels and elevated serum levels of phosphorus, even in the absence of overt hypocalcaemia.

PTH resistance and consequent changes in serum levels of calcium, phosphorus and PTH can be variable, and repeated testing might be required (A+++).

### Bone in parathyroid diseases revisited: evidence from epidemiological, surgical and new drug outcomes [^46043555]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 2.
Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a main regulator of calcium and phosphate metabolism. Calcium levels (Ca 2+) are tightly controlled through the action of PTH and 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 (calcitriol). Calcium-sensing receptors (CaSRs) are localized on the parathyroid cell membrane and detect changes in the serum Ca 2+ concentrations. Hypocalcemia triggers the release of PTH by the parathyroid cells; conversely, hypercalcemia suppresses the release of PTH. PTH stimulates bone resorption, which increases serum calcium and phosphate (PO 4 3−) levels. In the kidney, PTH stimulates the reabsorption of calcium and promotes phosphate excretion. PTH promotes the conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) to calcitriol in the kidney, the active form of vitamin D responsible for increased intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate. All these well-orchestrated steps restore calcium levels to the normal range (8.5–10.5 mg/dL) and via actions of PTH and other hormones, such as fibroblast growth factor 23, in the kidney, restore the phosphate levels within the normal range (2.5–4.5 mg/dL).

Genotype–phenotype correlation

Although XLH seems to be completely penetrant, its severity varies widely, even among family members, with no clear gender difference. A large number of inactivating mutations in PHEX can cause XLH, and a genotype–phenotype correlation is not obvious.

Further patient work-up

Patients should be evaluated for the presence and severity of common and rare complications of XLH depending on their age (Table 1). In young children, dynamic tests or specific investigations, such as hearing evaluation or oral examination, are sometimes not feasible and can be delayed until the child reaches 3–5 years of age.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^90483e54]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

In this Review, we describe the pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), with a focus on recent advances in the field. PHPT is a common endocrine disorder that is characterized by hypercalcaemia and elevated or inappropriately normal serum levels of parathyroid hormone. Most often, the presentation of PHPT is asymptomatic in regions of the world where serum levels of calcium are routinely measured. In addition to mild hypercalcaemia, PHPT can manifest with osteoporosis and hypercalciuria as well as with vertebral fractures and nephrolithiasis, both of which can be asymptomatic. Other clinical forms of PHPT, such as classical disease and normocalcaemic PHPT, are less common. Parathyroidectomy, the only curative treatment for PHPT, is recommended in patients with symptoms and those with asymptomatic disease who are at risk of progression or have subclinical evidence of end-organ sequelae. Parathyroidectomy results in an increase in BMD and a reduction in nephrolithiasis. Various medical therapies can increase BMD or reduce serum levels of calcium, but no single drug can do both. More data are needed regarding the neuropsychological manifestations of PHPT and the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to sporadic PHPT, as well as on risk factors for complications of the disorder. Future work that advances our knowledge in these areas will improve the management of the disorder.

Skeletal Outcomes

Skeletal outcomes of vitamin D deficiency are summarized in Fig. 3. Vitamin D deficiency leads to a decrease in intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate. Other biochemical abnormalities, such as hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and an increase in alkaline phosphatase, become apparent when serum 25(OH)D concentrations are lower than 25 nmol/L. In milder forms of vitamin D deficiency, the lower calcium concentration causes secondary hyperparathyroidism, which increases the conversion of 25(OH)D into 1,25(OH) 2 D, increasing calcium absorption and correcting serum calcium. Secondary hyperparathyroidism causes an increase in bone turnover, with relatively higher bone resorption at cortical sites. More severe longstanding vitamin D deficiency causes a decrease in the mineralization of newly formed osteoid tissue. This is visible in bone biopsies as an increase in osteoid surface and volume and increased thickness of osteoid seams, leading to the clinical picture of osteomalacia. Vitamin D deficiency and related secondary hyperparathyroidism cause bone loss and fractures in older adults. The incidence of hip fractures attributable to vitamin D deficiency has been estimated at 5% to 10%. Meta-analyses of clinical trials with vitamin D and calcium have demonstrated a decrease in hip and other fractures of around 10% in nursing home residents, whereas vitamin D alone was not effective. In these studies, baseline mean serum 25(OH)D after cross-calibration was found to be very low — namely less than 25 nmol/L — as was the calcium intake. As almost all effective trials used a calcium supplement in addition to vitamin D, the effect on BMD of vitamin D supplements alone is difficult to determine, but it is considered to be less than 1%, and high doses may even be harmful when administered to vitamin D–replete individuals. Recent RCTs such as the ViDA, VITAL, and D-Health studies do not show skeletal benefits for mostly vitamin D–replete adults and older individuals; for example, in the VITAL trial, cholecalciferol supplementation did not result in a significantly lower risk of fractures (total, nonvertebral, and hip fractures) than placebo among generally healthy midlife and older adults not selected for vitamin D deficiency, low bone mass, or osteoporosis. In the D-Health study, large bolus monthly doses (60 000 IU) resulted in no increase nor decrease in fracture risk overall. However, the hazard ratio appeared to decrease with increasing follow-up time. Interestingly, in a recent retrospective longitudinal study, the use of cholecalciferol was associated with reduced incidence of morphometric vertebral fractures in high skeletal risk, such as acromegaly.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^3748f23b]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency in children — monitoring therapy includes scheduled labs and imaging. It is important to obtain calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels 1 month after initiating therapy, and with stoss therapy a biochemical response occurs in 1 or 2 weeks with an early increase in phosphate; ALP may actually increase in the short term, there is usually an initial increase in 1,25(OH)2-D, then ALP and 1,25(OH)2-D decrease to normal while 25(OH)-D increases to within the reference range. Complete radiologic healing may take months, but changes are evident in 1 week. In 3 months, it is important to obtain calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, ALP, 25(OH)-D, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, and one may consider obtaining a urine sample to determine the calcium/creatinine ratio. A radiograph should be repeated at 3 months, and subsequently 25(OH)-D levels should be monitored yearly.

### Patients with elevated serum parathyroid hormone levels after parathyroidectomy: showing signs of decreased peripheral parathyroid hormone sensitivity [^908f7ebe]. World Journal of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

We have previously shown that patients with elevated levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) after surgery for parathyroid adenoma have normal parathyroid and renal function but demonstrate signs of remineralization of cortical bone, decreased calcium absorption, and low levels of vitamin D. We hypothesized that decreased peripheral PTH sensitivity could also be of importance for this condition. Thirteen patients operated on for a solitary parathyroid adenoma, with a mean ± SD preoperative serum level of calcium of 2.72 ± 0.12 mmol/L, were investigated 6 weeks after surgery with a standardized PTH (1–34) infusion test for 6 hours. The eight patients with elevated PTH levels had less increase in serum levels of ionized calcium (0.02 ± 0.03 mmol/L) than did the five patients with normal PTH levels (0.06 ± 0.02 mmol/L) (p < 0.05). Patients with elevated PTH also showed less decrease in serum phosphate levels (p < 0.05) and a trend to a larger decrease in the excretion of urinary calcium (p = 0.08). The increase in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) did not differ between the two groups of patients. Thus patients operated on for parathyroid adenoma with postoperatively elevated serum PTH levels showed decreased peripheral sensitivity to PTH.

### Management of primary hyperparathyroidism: historical and contemporary perspectives [^0465e822]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a frequently diagnosed endocrine condition most commonly caused by a single parathyroid adenoma. Our understanding of the epidemiology and management of PHPT have evolved in the past few decades. Asymptomatic PHPT has been the most common presentation in developed countries since the advent of routine biochemical screening. Symptomatic disease is now also decreasing in developing nations. Normocalcemic PHPT is a newer phenotype that can be diagnosed in the setting of elevated PTH concentrations with persistently normal serum calcium, however, evaluation for secondary causes of hyperparathyroidism is critical as it is a diagnosis of exclusion. Genetic testing can be helpful in patients younger than 30 years of age and/or patients with intermediate or equivocal ranges of the urinary calcium to creatinine ratio (between 0.01 and 0.02) to differentiate PHPT from FHH and to evaluate for other genetic etiologies that may affect management. Surgery is the recommended treatment modality for symptomatic PHPT, and patients with asymptomatic PHPT meeting recommended criteria should also be considered for parathyroidectomy. "Asymptomatic" patients should be screened for the presence of nephrolithiasis and/or vertebral fracture, since many will be reclassified as having symptomatic disease with further investigation. For poor surgical candidates or patients not meeting criteria for surgery, medical therapy includes cinacalcet for hypercalcemia and antiresorptive therapies for osteoporosis.

### Incidence of primary hyperparathyroidism in the current era: have we finally reached a steady state? [^e5f3994c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

There are several emerging concepts that may influence PHPT epidemiology in the future. First, recent investigations suggest that familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) is more prevalent than previously thought. Pathogenic mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor causing FHH1 have an estimated prevalence of 74.1 per 100 000, which approaches the prevalence of PHPT in premenopausal women and men. If one also considers FHH2, FHH3, and the 30% of individuals with FHH who do not have an identifiable mutation, then the prevalence should be higher. Further complicating matters, PHPT and FHH can be biochemically indistinguishable. Also, some FHH patients will undergo parathyroid surgery and this should be considered in persistent and recurrent PHPT. It is likely that genetic testing will be used more frequently to distinguish these entities, especially in younger individuals, those with a family history of hypercalcemia or PHPT, or if hypercalcemia has been long-standing without evidence of prior eucalcemia.

Normocalcemic PHPT is increasingly recognized as a milder subtype of PHPT that presents with eucalcemia and elevated PTH. In this context, milder forms of PHPT may be unrecognized and underestimate the true incidence rate and prevalence of PHPT. Also, PTH and calcium levels vary depending on multiple physiological influences, but in general serum calcium remains remarkably stable with aging, whereas PTH increases with age. The challenge in identifying patients with normocalcemic PHPT is distinguishing this from other causes of secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Finally, it is clear that incidence rates and prevalence are growing in countries outside North America and Europe due to increasing serum calcium measurements, which have also been associated with a change in patient presentation from symptomatic to asymptomatic disease. Hence, a global increase in the incidence rates and prevalence of PHPT should be anticipated. It will be important to have population-based data from other countries to better understand the global burden of this condition. This would be helpful to clarify ethnic differences in PHPT and perhaps allow provision of individualized management. This is especially of interest since in the United States older Black women have the highest prevalence of PHPT. Such data may also provide insights into possible fundamental mechanisms for the development of PHPT, which remains largely unknown in sporadic disease. Indeed, it will be interesting to see how the landscape of PHPT changes over the next 5 decades.

### Hypovitaminosis D masking hypercalcemia in primary hyperparathyroidism: case report [^edfc75ca]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyperparathyroidism (HPTH) is the third most common endocrine disorder. Hypovitaminosis D affects up to 40% of the general population and about a third of hyperparathyroid patients. Such a combination may alter the classic presentation of HPTH. This report presents a premenopausal female with long history of osteoporosis, normocalcemia, and hypovitaminosis D who was initially diagnosed as secondary HPTH. After restoring vitamin D to normal using parenteral loading doses, the patient developed persistent mild to moderate hypercalcemia with persistent parathormone elevation consistent with primary HPTH associated with hypercalciuria and complicated with nephrocalcinosis. Imaging confirmed a left upper parathyroid adenoma and fulfilling several indications for surgery, the patient was operated restoring normocalcemia that was maintained for several years of follow-up. Hypovitaminosis D is common and may mask expected hypercalcemia in patients with primary HPTH, thus delaying diagnosis and proper intervention. Reevaluating patients initially diagnosed as hypovitaminosis D and secondary HPTH may reveal a masked diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism.

Kidney transplant recipients — calcium/phosphorus monitoring and vitamin D — are addressed by the commentary, which concurs with the recommendation to measure calcium and phosphorus weekly after transplant because dramatic changes can occur in these elements in the early posttransplant period. Vitamin D deficiency is extremely common in KTRs, and low vitamin D levels should be repleted to control secondary hyperparathyroidism; although vitamin D repletion can lead to a decrease in PTH levels, there are no data for improvement in bone disease with repletion. It is not clear at what level parathyroid hormone (PTH) should be maintained in KTRs, and higher than normal PTH levels may be required to preserve bone formation in KTRs on steroid therapy.

### Reduced parathyroid hormone-stimulated 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D production in vitamin D sufficient postmenoposual women with low bone mass and idiopathic secondary hyperparathyroidism [^42068ed4]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Distinguishing secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) from eucalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism (EC-pHPT) is important. The objective of this study was to measure parathyroid hormone (PTH)-stimulated production of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]2D) in early postmenopausal patients with idiopathic sHPT, who also fit the criteria for EC-pHPT, compared to age-matched controls.

Methods

In this pilot case-control study, postmenopausal women aged 44 to 55 years with normal serum calcium (Ca), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 65 mL/min, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) ≥ 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL) were given an 8 hour infusion of PTH(1–34), 12 pmol/kg/h. Patients (n = 5) had elevated PTH, normal 1,25(OH)2D, and no hypercalciuria. Controls (n = 5) had normal PTH. At baseline, 4, and 8 hours, serum Ca, creatinine (Cr), phosphorus (P), 1,25(OH)2D, fibroblast growth factor (FGF23), and 24,25(OH)2D as well as urine Ca, P, Cr, and cAMP/GFR were measured. The fractional excretion of calcium (FeCa) and tubular reabsorption of phosphorus (TMP)/GFR were calculated.

Results

Patients had lower 1,25(OH)2D levels (± SD) than controls at 4 (39.8 ± 6.9 versus 58.8 ± 6.7; P = 0.002) and 8 hours (56.4 ± 9.2 versus 105 ± 2.3; P = 0.003) of PTH infusion, attenuated after adjusting for higher body mass index (BMI) in patients (P = 0.05, .04), respectively. The 24,25(OH)2D levels were lower in patients than controls (1.9 ± 0.6 versus 3.4 ± 0.6, respectively; P = 0.007). No differences were seen in serum Ca or P, urine cAMP/GFR, TRP/GFR, FeCa, or PTH suppression at 8 hours (patients 50%, controls 64%).

Conclusion

Vitamin D sufficient patients who fit the criteria for EC-pHPT had reduced PTH-stimulated 1,25(OH)2D compared to controls, partially attributable to their higher BMI. Other causes of reduced 1,25(OH)2D production ruled out were excessive catabolism of vitamin D metabolites, elevated FGF23, and CYP27B1 mutation. Elevated BMI and idiopathic reduced PTH-stimulated 1,25(OH)2D production should be considered in the differential of sHPT.

### Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D insufficiency in search of a bone disease [^93c95cc8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Vitamin D "insufficiency" and "deficiency" are defined as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels < 75 and < 30 nmol/L, respectively. We aimed to determine whether these values signal hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, high bone remodeling, low areal bone mineral density (aBMD), microstructural deterioration, or reduced matrix mineralization density (MMD) and so suggest whether bone fragility is present.

Methods

Concentrations of 25(OH)D, calcium, phosphate, creatinine, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) were measured in 11,855 participants. Serum C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen, procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP), aBMD, and distal radius microstructure and MMD were measured in a second subset of 150 participants.

Results

A breakpoint for calcium, PTH, and alkaline phosphatase was identified at a threshold 25(OH)D level < 30 nmol/L. There was no plateau beyond 75 nmol/L. In the subgroup with measurements of bone morphology, no associations were detectable between serum 25(OH)D concentration, aBMD, trabecular density, cortical porosity, or MMD. Among 1439 participants with serum 25(OH)D < 30 nmol/L, 6.1% had low serum calcium, 3.4% had low serum phosphate, 6.1% had high alkaline phosphatase, and 34.2% had elevated PTH. Most participants did not have any abnormalities.

Conclusion

At a 25(OH)D threshold of ≤ 30 nmol/L, abnormalities in biochemical features support the notion of a "deficiency" state predisposing to bone disease. However, no deleterious effects were found in participants within an insufficiency threshold of a 25(OH)D level of 30 to 75 nmol/L, which challenges the rationale justifying vitamin D supplementation in these individuals.

### Diagnosis of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: proceedings of the third international workshop [^4c8c1814]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common clinical problem. The purpose of this report is to guide the use of diagnostic tests for this condition in clinical practice.

Participants

Interested professional societies selected a representative for the consensus committee and provided funding for a one-day meeting. A subgroup of this committee set the program and developed key questions for review. Consensus was established at a closed meeting that followed. The conclusions were then circulated to the participating professional societies.

Evidence

Each question was addressed by a relevant literature search (on PubMed), and the data were presented for discussion at the group meeting.

Consensus Process

Consensus was achieved by a group meeting. Statements were prepared by all authors, with comments relating to accuracy from the diagnosis subgroup and by representatives from the participating professional societies.

Conclusions

We conclude that: 1) reference ranges should be established for serum PTH in vitamin D-replete healthy individuals; 2) second- and third-generation PTH assays are both helpful in the diagnosis of PHPT; 3) DNA sequence testing can be useful in familial hyperparathyroidism or hypercalcemia; 4) normocalcemic PHPT is a variant of the more common presentation of PHPT with hypercalcemia; 5) serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels should be measured and, if vitamin D insufficiency is present, it should be treated as part of any management course; and 6) the estimated glomerular filtration rate should be used to determine the level of kidney function in PHPT: an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 ml/min.1.73 m2 should be a benchmark for decisions about surgery in established asymptomatic PHPT.

Results

Prevalence of HPT in 1995 and at follow‐up

At first assessment in 1995, 25 subjects had elevated S‐PTH and normal S‐Ca, of whom 12 of 608 were vitamin D sufficient thereby fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for nHPT, giving a prevalence of 2·0% in the age range 25–64 years (Table 1). At the reassessment of nHPT, 13 years later, five individuals were either deceased or lost to follow‐up. Three of the remaining subjects had normalized their S‐PTH levels and were vitamin D sufficient. One subject had nHPT both in 1995 and in 2008. Two had vitamin D insufficiency with elevated S‐PTH levels. One woman had developed breast cancer, mild hypercalcaemia (2·55 mmol/l), but normal S‐PTH (36 ng/l) and high S‐25(OH)D (133 nmol/l) with a daily supplementation of 1000 mg Ca and 800 IU Vitamin D3; a possible progression to pHPT (Fig. 1). Two of seven had fractured during follow‐up.

### Medical management of primary hyperparathyroidism: proceedings of the fourth international workshop on the management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism [^c5728af7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common clinical problem. The only available definitive therapy is parathyroidectomy, which is appropriate to consider in all patients. The purpose of this report is to provide an update on calcium and vitamin D supplementation and medical management for those patients with PHPT who cannot or do not want to undergo surgery.

Methods

Questions were developed by the International Task Force on PHPT. A comprehensive literature search was undertaken, and relevant articles published between 2008 and 2013 were reviewed in detail. The questions were addressed by the panel of experts, and consensus was established at the time of the workshop.

Conclusions

The recommended calcium intake in patients with PHPT should follow guidelines established for all individuals. It is not recommended to limit calcium intake in patients with PHPT who do not undergo surgery. Patients with low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be repleted with doses of vitamin D aiming to bring serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels to ≥ 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) at a minimum, but a goal of ≥ 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL) also is reasonable. Pharmacological approaches are available and should be reserved for those patients in whom it is desirable to lower the serum calcium, increase BMD, or both. For the control of hypercalcemia, cinacalcet is the treatment of choice. Cinacalcet reduces serum calcium concentrations to normal in many cases, but has only a modest effect on serum PTH levels. However, bone mineral density (BMD) does not change. To improve BMD, bisphosphonate therapy is recommended. The best evidence is for the use of alendronate, which improves BMD at the lumbar spine without altering the serum calcium concentration. To reduce the serum calcium and improve BMD, combination therapy with both agents is reasonable, but strong evidence for the efficacy of that approach is lacking.

### Hyperparathyroidism [^eebf78c1]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on primary hyperparathyroidism:

- **Definition**: Primary hyperparathyroidism is an endocrine disorder of calcium metabolism resulting from an abnormal increase in the secretion of PTH from one or more of the parathyroid glands.
- **Pathophysiology**: Primary hyperparathyroidism is primarily caused by solitary parathyroid adenoma (80%), four-gland hyperplasia (10–15%), multiple adenomas (5%), and parathyroid cancer (< 1%).
- **Epidemiology**: The average incidence of primary hyperparathyroidism in men and women in the US is 24.7 and 65.5 cases per 100,000 person-years, respectively. The age-adjusted prevalence in men and women is 85.2 and 232.7 per 100,000 individuals, respectively.
- **Disease course**: Primary hyperparathyroidism can present with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic biochemical abnormalities to overt end-organ complications. In developed countries, approximately 85% of patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis, identified incidentally through routine biochemical screening, while around 20% present with renal manifestations (such as nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis), skeletal complications (including fractures, osteitis fibrosa cystica, or bone pain), or symptomatic hypercalcemia. In contrast, the majority of patients in developing countries present with symptomatic disease. Symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism is associated with overt skeletal and renal complications and may also include cardiovascular and neurocognitive symptoms. Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism is further classified based on the presence or absence of target organ involvement, such as reduced bone mineral density or kidney stones. Normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism, defined by elevated PTH levels in the setting of normal serum calcium, may also present with or without end-organ involvement.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Parathyroidectomies have > 98% cure rates. The recurrence rates of double parathyroid adenoma, hyperplasia, and single adenoma are 4.0%, 2.2%, and 1.3%, respectively.

### Relationship between serum parathyroid hormone levels, vitamin D sufficiency, and calcium intake [^55340b92]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Adequate vitamin D status for optimum bone health has received increased recognition in recent years; however, the ideal intake is not known. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D is the generally accepted indicator of vitamin D status, but no universal reference level has been reached.

Objective

To investigate the relative importance of high calcium intake and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D for calcium homeostasis, as determined by serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH).

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cross-sectional study of 2310 healthy Icelandic adults who were divided equally into 3 age groups (30–45 years, 50–65 years, or 70–85 years) and recruited from February 2001 to January 2003. They were administered a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, which assessed vitamin D and calcium intake. Participants were further divided into groups according to calcium intake (< 800 mg/d, 800–1200 mg/d, and > 1200 mg/d) and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (< 10 ng/mL, 10–18 ng/mL, and > 18 ng/mL).

Main Outcome Measure

Serum intact PTH as determined by calcium intake and vitamin D.

Results

A total of 944 healthy participants completed all parts of the study. After adjusting for relevant factors, serum PTH was lowest in the group with a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of more than 18 ng/mL but highest in the group with a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of less than 10 ng/mL. At the low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (< 10 ng/mL), calcium intake of less than 800 mg/d vs more than 1200 mg/d was significantly associated with higher serum PTH (P = 0.04); and at a calcium intake of more than 1200 mg/d, there was a significant difference between the lowest and highest vitamin D groups (P = 0.04).

Conclusions

As long as vitamin D status is ensured, calcium intake levels of more than 800 mg/d may be unnecessary for maintaining calcium metabolism. Vitamin D supplements are necessary for adequate vitamin D status in northern climates.

Participants

Eligible participants included men and nonpregnant women (≥ 18 years of age) with chronic hypoparathyroidism of postsurgical, autoimmune, genetic, or idiopathic etiologies for a duration of at least 26 weeks. Participants must have been treated with calcitriol ≥ 0.5 μg/d or alfacalcidol ≥ 1.0 μg/d in addition to elemental calcium ≥ 800 mg/d for at least 12 weeks before screening. Stable doses of conventional therapy (ie, active vitamin D and calcium) were required for at least 5 weeks before screening, not precluding occasional (≤ 2/week) pro re nata (PRN, as needed) doses of calcium and/or active vitamin D. To ensure safety for those who might be randomized to the placebo arm, participants were required to achieve an albumin‐adjusted or ionized serum calcium within the normal range or slightly below the normal range (albumin‐adjusted serum calcium 7.8–10.6 mg/dL [1.95–2.64 mmol/L] or ionized serum calcium 4.40–5.29 mg/dL [1.10–1.32 mmol/L]), 25(OH) vitamin D levels 20–80 ng/mL (49–200 nmol/L), and magnesium levels ≥ 1.3 mg/dL (0.53 mmol/L), as is currently the goal of conventional treatment. Urinary calcium excretion ≥ 125 mg/24 h and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 was required for enrollment. The diagnosis of hypoparathyroidism was confirmed by the presence of persistent hypocalcemia in the setting of inappropriately low serum PTH levels. Low PTH levels were defined as at or below the median value of the reference range at the performing laboratory. Individuals with impaired responsiveness to PTH (pseudohypoparathyroidism) or any disease that might affect calcium metabolism, calcium × phosphate homeostasis, or PTH levels other than hypoparathyroidism were excluded. Thiazide diuretic use was not allowed within 4 weeks before the 24‐hour urine collection before visit 1, and the use of PTH analogs was not allowed within 4 weeks of screening. Eligible participants could not have used other drugs known to influence calcium and bone metabolism (except for active vitamin D analogs and elemental calcium) within 12 weeks before screening or osteoporosis therapies known to influence calcium and bone metabolism (ie, bisphosphonate) within 2 years before screening. The use of loop diuretics, phosphate binders, digoxin, lithium, methotrexate, biotin > 30 μg/d, and systemic corticosteroids (other than as replacement therapy) were not permitted during the trial. All participants provided signed informed consent before treatment initiation.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: what is the role of parathyroid surgery? [^fd3394e3]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Does surgical referral differ for nPHPT patients?

A key question remains as to whether nPHPT should be considered a different entity to hPHPT, or if they can be managed using a single approach. Whilst studies have reported that nPHPT presents differently to hPHPT, such as with a higher incidence of multi-glandular disease,– studies have also shown that a proportion of normocalcaemic patients will progress to hypercalcaemia. In line with this, a standardised approach to managing PHPT irrespective of serum calcium appears appropriate and the aforementioned NICE guidance for PHPT surgical referral remains applicable for nPHPT. However, it is important that discussions regarding surgery are individualised and patient expectations are comprehensively explored. This involves counselling the patient to ensure adequate understanding of both the positive (a reduction in end-organ effects) and adverse (risk of surgical complications) outcomes that may occur following surgery.

For clinicians, it is also important to avoid routinely screening PTH levels unless there is evidence to suggest measurement would be appropriate. This includes evidence of calcium homeostasis disturbance, renal dysfunction and occasionally if there is vitamin D deficiency.

Limitations of the current literature

Many of the studies investigating the role of surgery in the treatment of nPHPT consist of a relatively small cohort of patients. This is compounded by comparative studies in the field generally having a significantly larger number of hPHPT patients relative to nPHPT patients. Future studies should aim to analyse larger nPHPT cohorts, with comparative studies providing equal representation to nPHPT and hPHPT patients. Moreover, there is a need for large consortia based prospective registries of those managed both surgically and medically, with an extended follow up period of more than 10 years. This would enable the true natural history and adverse events of treatment to be observed, providing much needed clarity to clinicians.

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^5bf2109f]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Potential harms — screening and treatment considerations: Screening may misclassify persons with a vitamin D deficiency because of uncertainty about the cutoff for deficiency and variability of available testing assays, which can lead to overdiagnosis or underdiagnosis. A rare but potential harm of treatment with vitamin D is toxicity characterized by marked hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypercalciuria; however, the 25(OH)D level associated with toxicity (typically > 150 ng/mL) is well above the level considered sufficient, and in general, treatment with oral vitamin D does not seem to be associated with serious harms.

Management of PTH resistance

Even though PTH resistance is the hallmark of PHP and is referenced in the name of the disorder, very few studies have focused on the natural history of its appearance, and almost none on its management.

Long-term treatment of hypocalcaemia associated with PTH resistance is similar but usually more aggressive than that of primary hypoparathyroidism, with the use of active vitamin D metabolites (calcitriol) or analogues (alfacalcidol) and oral calcium supplements as and when required. The current approach is to reduce the serum level of PTH to the upper portion of the reference range to avoid suppression of PTH, which can be associated with hypercalciuria and renal calcification. Serum levels of PTH that are at the upper limits of the reference range are sufficient to enhance calcium reabsorption in the distal renal tubule, thus helping to prevent hypercalciuria. However, PTH levels should not be too high, as long-standing PTH excess might have adverse effects on skeletal mineralization or on the growth plate. Accordingly, treatment with oral calcium and active vitamin D supplementation can be used to target a higher serum level of calcium than in patients with PTH-deficient hypocalcaemia, where treatment targets the low–normal or slightly reduced range of calcium. As a result of the preserved sensitivity of the distal convoluted tubules, patients with PHP and related disorders very rarely develop hypercalciuria. However, several experts involved in this Consensus Statement have encountered episodes of nephrolithiasis in patients with PHP1A and PHP1B, particularly after completion of pubertal growth, when the doses of oral calcium and active vitamin D analogues can be reduced (G.M. P.K, A.R. and A.L. unpublished observations).

### A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled first-in-human phase 1 trial of transCon PTH in healthy adults [^fd69ab45]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Standard‐of‐care (SoC) for chronic HP — specifically active vitamin D and calcium — only corrects hypocalcemia, targeting a serum calcium (sCa) just below or in the lower level of normal range to avoid worsening hypercalciuria, and is frequently associated with a sCa nadir prior to the next morning dose. SoC also does not restore PTH‐dependent renal calcium reabsorption, phosphate excretion, or normal bone turnover. In fact, long‐term active vitamin D and calcium may produce adverse effects beyond the original problems associated with HP, including an increase in calcium × phosphate product and urinary calcium (uCa) that together may lead to nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, and renal insufficiency as well as ectopic calcifications.

Until recently, HP was the last remaining classic endocrine deficiency disorder for which the missing hormone was not available as a therapy. In 1996, Winer and colleaguesestablished the experimental basis for using PTH(1‐34) to treat HP, showing that daily PTH(1‐34) injections are superior to SoC in treating adults and children with HP, allowing complete withdrawal of SoC while better controlling urinary calcium excretion. Follow‐up studies demonstrated that twice daily PTH(1‐34) injections are superior to SoC or once‐daily injections., Importantly, continuous subcutaneous (s.c.) PTH(1‐34) infusion via an insulin pump at a 62% to 65% lower daily dose, which produces physiological PTH levels over 24 hours, was superior to twice daily PTH(1‐34), resulting in more stable sCa levels, normal serum phosphate (sP), and serum magnesium (sMg) levels, normal uCa excretion, and a normalized rate of bone turnover in adults and children with HP while allowing complete withdrawal of SoC. These studies demonstrated that renal tubules need more frequent PTH dosing than twice per day to optimally control uCa. Despite currently available therapies, some patients still experience acute symptoms that can be severe and debilitating, negatively affecting activities of daily living and quality of life. Further, the long‐term consequences of hypercalciuria with subsequent renal failure is a major cause of morbidity among HP‐treated patients. Thus, a PTH replacement therapy that fully controls the disease, including episodes of hypercalcemia and hypocalcemia as well as hypercalciuria, remains an unmet need.

### American Thyroid Association statement on postoperative hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, prevention, and management in adults [^4d8bc013]. Thyroid (2018). Medium credibility.

Preoperative vitamin D deficiency — In planned bilateral thyroid operations, preoperative serum calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and 25‑hydroxy vitamin D testing can be helpful; if calcium is low normal or below normal the risk of hypoparathyroidism is increased and scheduled oral calcium may be appropriate. Vitamin D deficiency categories are severe (< 10 ng/mL), moderate (10 to < 20), or mild (20–30), and to optimize postoperative oral calcium absorption it is prudent to treat vitamin D deficiency preoperatively. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved regimen is 50,000 IU of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) weekly or 6000 IU daily for eight weeks. Given the present evidence, it would appear preferable to diagnose vitamin D deficiency and initiate appropriate corrective supplementation prior to surgery, and in elective bilateral thyroid surgery it may be prudent to defer surgery in order to correct severe vitamin D deficiency.

### Normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism: study of its prevalence and natural history [^97f0bc76]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

Normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism (NPHPT) is characterized by persistently normal calcium levels and elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) values, after excluding other causes of secondary hyperparathyroidism. The prevalence of the disease varies greatly and the data on the natural history of this disease are sparse and inconclusive.

Objectives

The objectives of this study are to describe the prevalence of NPHPT and its natural history in a referral population and to compare the variability of serum calcium with a group of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT).

Design

A retrospective study was conducted over 5 years.

Setting

The setting for this study was a metabolic bone referral center.

Patients

A total of 6280 patients were referred for a bone mineral density measurement (BMD).

Main Outcome Measures

The prevalence and natural history of NPHPT and variability of calcium were the main outcome measures.

Results

We identified NPHPT patients using data from the day of the BMD measurement. We excluded patients with low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or vitamin D, or with no measurements available. Based on the evaluation of their medical files, we identified 11 patients with NPHPT (prevalence 0.18%). Only 4 patients had consistent normocalcemia throughout their follow-up, with only 2 also having consistently high PTH. None had consistently normal eGFR or vitamin D. Intermittent hypercalcemia was present in 7 of the 11 NPHPT patients. The mean adjusted calcium was found to be significantly lower in the NPHPT group compared with the PHPT group but higher than the control group. PTH was similar for NPHPT and PHPT. These 2 groups had similar variability in serum calcium.

Conclusions

NPHPT patients often have episodes of hypercalcemia. We believe that NPHPT is a mild form of PHPT.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for primary hyperparathyroidism, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, PHPT-IW-5 2022 guidelines recommend to diagnose hypercalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism based on an elevated serum calcium level adjusted for albumin in conjunction with an elevated or inappropriately normal intact PTH level, using either a second or third generation assay, on two occasions at least 2 weeks apart.

### Associations of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D with circulating PTH, phosphate and calcium in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism [^94fa7389]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Despite NIH clinical recommendations, many clinicians are reluctant to replace vitamin D in patients with hypercalcaemia with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHP) due to concerns over aggravating hypercalcaemia. Furthermore, the optimum level of vitamin D replacement in PHP remains unclear.

Methods

We performed a large retrospective study to determine whether a relationship exists between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, calcium and other important biochemical markers in patients with PHP. Serum, plasma and urinary biochemical measurements were collected from 251 patients with hypercalcaemia diagnosed with PHP.

Results

When examining overall mean circulating levels during clinical follow-up, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D correlated highly significantly with plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) (r = -0.23, P = 0.0003) and serum phosphate (r = 0.16, P = 0.0119). No significant relationship was observed between serum calcium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (r = 0.002, P = 0.98). Mean plasma PTH during clinical follow-up was 51% lower in patients with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D > 60 nm when compared with patients who had 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 20 nm (P < 0.01).

Conclusions

Patients with PHP who have 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels > 60 nm have significantly reduced PTH hypersecretion when compared with patients with deficient vitamin D levels, without exhibiting worse hypercalcaemia.

### New parathyroid function index for the differentiation of primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism: a case-control study [^d7d892e1]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is one of the most important hormones required for the maintenance of calcium and phosphate homeostasis. This hormone induces the 1α-hydroxylation of 25(OH) D to 1,25(OH) 2 D, which promotes intestinal absorption and the release of calcium and phosphate from the bone, while regulating mineral reabsorption in the renal tubules. The intrinsic abnormal excretion or extrinsic abnormal stimulation of PTH production leads to primary, secondary, or tertiary hyperparathyroidism.

A diagnosis of classic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) can be made easily according to its biochemical, skeletal, and renal manifestations. However, increases in routine serum calcium testing, as well as the incidental discovery of parathyroid nodules on thyroid ultrasonography, has led to an increase in the detection frequency of asymptomatic PHPT (including normocalcemic PHPT, NPHPT) in recent decades. Thus, a correct clinical diagnosis of this disease is important.

Chronic renal insufficiency and vitamin D deficiency are the most common causes of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). The former can be easily distinguished from the medical history and laboratory tests. However, it is difficult to distinguish vitamin D deficiency-induced SHPT (VD-SHPT) from PHPT. Patients diagnosed with either VD-SHPT or PHPT would have an elevated PTH concentration, and many presented with vitamin D deficiency as well as a normal serum calcium concentration. Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish between these diseases based on laboratory results. Although the two diseases can be distinguished when a patient's vitamin D storage is replete, a period of at least 8 weeks is required to normalize the 25(OH) D concentration, leading to delays in appropriate treatment. Therefore, a convenient clinical tool to differentiate PHPT from VD-SHPT.

According to the pathogeneses of these two diseases, PHPT is associated with a relatively higher serum calcium but lower phosphate concentration, while VD-SHPT is characterized by relatively lower serum calcium and phosphate concentrations. Using this information, we created a parathyroid function index (PFindex) to magnify the biochemical differences between these diseases. This equation multiplies the serum PTH (pmol/L) by the albumin-corrected serum calcium concentration (mmol/L), and then divides this value by the serum phosphate concentration (mmol/L). In this case-control study, we aimed to verify the diagnostic power of the PFindex in subjects with confirmed PHPT and SHPT, as well as healthy subjects.

### Who benefits from treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism? [^e23c1131]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Parathyroidectomy (PTx) is the only definitive treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), but is commonly underutilized. Most patients are medically observed, whereas approximately 30% of patients are treated operatively. PTx is a low-risk surgical procedure and the most cost-effective treatment option. An international consensus statement was published in 1990 to guide clinicians in the management of patients with PHPT, particularly those with asymptomatic disease. Most patients with PHPT and low perioperative risk benefit from surgical treatment, regardless of whether they meet consensus criteria, due to fracture risk reduction, health-related quality-of-life improvements, and prevention or mitigation of disease progression.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^ac90b227]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) testing — In the general adult population younger than age 50 years, we suggest against routine 25(OH)D testing (2 | ⊕◯◯◯). Technical remarks state that, in this population, 25(OH)D levels that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials and that the panel suggests against routine screening for a 25(OH)D level to guide decision-making and against routine follow-up testing for 25(OH)D level to guide vitamin D dosing; this recommendation relates to generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia). Based on the panel's best estimates of treatment effects, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D are likely to be small at best and the anticipated undesirable effects are likely to be trivial, and panel members judged that empiric vitamin D would likely be acceptable to individuals in this age group, especially females with risk factors for developing osteoporosis.
