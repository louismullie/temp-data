## Question

what are the questions to ask the transitional care team for my 17 year old special needs daughter who is a candidate for community partnership program

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what questions to ask the transitional care team for a 17-year-old with special needs who is a candidate for a community partnership program. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core elements of health care transition and how they map to a community partnership context. Then, I should verify which questions align with evidence-based transition processes and readiness assessment. Next, I will consider special-needs specific issues like decision-making supports, insurance, and home/community services. Finally, I will organize the questions into a practical, prioritized list that families can use in meetings with the team, making sure I double-check that each item is supported by guidance or studies where possible.

> Let me first confirm the foundational framework. The Six Core Elements of Health Care Transition — policy, tracking, readiness, planning, transfer, and completion — provide the backbone for structured transition and should anchor the questions we ask, even when the program is framed as a community partnership rather than a purely clinical transfer, because the same principles of preparation, coordination, and follow-up apply [^2ac3fd81] [^f4ea1f79].

> I need to check readiness assessment next. Validated tools like TRAQ, STARx, or condition-specific instruments (for example, EpiTRAQ for epilepsy) help quantify self-management skills and identify gaps; asking which tool will be used, how often it will be repeated, and how results will guide individualized goals is essential, and I should confirm that the team plans reassessment over time rather than a one-time check [^4a1789f9] [^f4ea1f79] [^000ac605].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about timing. I initially thought "start at 14" was a hard rule, but wait, let me verify — while many programs recommend starting in early adolescence, the key is to begin no later than age 16–17 to allow adequate preparation before legal adulthood at 18; for youth with intellectual/developmental disability, planning for decision-making supports should start by 17, so I should ask when the process truly began and whether it is individualized to her developmental level [^699b41ea] [^8a1bad6f] [^08ed74e3].

> Next, I should review the transfer logistics. I will ask about the transfer package contents (medical summary, readiness assessment, emergency plan, legal documents if needed), confirmation of the first adult appointment, and whether there will be a warm handoff or joint visit; I should also confirm pediatric responsibility until the first adult visit and whether a virtual meet-and-greet is planned to reduce anxiety and improve attendance [^f4ea1f79] [^788ff5e8].

> I need to ensure we address decision-making and legal considerations. For youth with cognitive or communication limitations, I should ask about supported decision-making, power of attorney, and guardianship options, and request that the team document the least-restrictive approach and provide resources such as medical-legal partnerships; I should double-check that these discussions are happening now, not after age 18 [^08ed74e3] [^0bed92b1].

> Let me consider insurance and benefits continuity, because gaps are common. I should ask how the team will help verify current coverage, anticipate changes at 18 or 26, and connect us with Medicaid, SSI, waiver programs, and vocational rehabilitation; I should confirm whether a benefits counselor or social worker will be assigned to coordinate this proactively [^f4ea1f79] [^ec143606].

> I will now examine home and community supports, since a community partnership program often interfaces with nonmedical services. I should ask about home health eligibility, durable medical equipment vendors, respite, transportation, and whether the team will help identify local agencies and coordinate training for family caregivers; I should confirm that the medical home maintains an up-to-date care plan and that discharge summaries include equipment and medication reconciliation [^12ecb0ce] [^7c9c5fcc].

> But wait, what if adult providers lack pediatric-onset expertise? I should ask how the team will match her with adult clinicians experienced in her condition, whether pediatric consultation will be available after transfer, and whether there are condition-specific adult programs or clinics; I should also confirm that the adult team will receive the full transfer packet and a direct communication line to the pediatric team [^f4ea1f79] [^9c1cf3a1].

> Next, I should review psychosocial and developmental supports. I need to ask about behavioral health integration, peer mentoring, and connections to community organizations for recreation, advocacy, and family support; I should confirm that the plan addresses social determinants of health and includes strategies to build self-advocacy and resilience [^750079fb] [^ec143606].

> I should double-check measurement and follow-up. I will ask how the team defines success, which outcomes they track (for example, attendance at first adult visit, medication adherence, emergency use, quality of life), and how they will solicit feedback from my daughter and from me; I should confirm that they use a structured approach like the Six Core Elements and plan to close the loop on any missed steps [^f4ea1f79] [^80653d7a].

> Let me synthesize the most critical questions to ask now, while I keep verifying details with the team. First, what is the exact timeline from now until transfer, including readiness reassessments and the date of the first adult appointment? Second, which readiness tool will be used and how will results change her individualized plan? Third, what decision-making supports and legal documents are needed and by when? Fourth, how will insurance and home/community services be coordinated, and who is the point person? Fifth, what does the transfer package include and how will we confirm receipt by the adult team? Sixth, how will the team track outcomes and what should we do if problems arise after transfer? These align with best-practice guidance and should be answered concretely in the meeting [^2ac3fd81] [^f4ea1f79] [^08ed74e3].

For a 17-year-old with special needs entering a community partnership program, ask the transitional care team about **readiness assessment** (tool, timing, and how results guide planning) [^4a1789f9], **individualized transition plan** (goals, timeline, and who leads) [^f4ea1f79], and **adult provider matching** (how they are selected, availability, and pediatric consultation) [^9c1cf3a1]. Also ask about **legal/decision-making supports** (guardianship, power of attorney, supported decision-making) [^08ed74e3], **insurance continuity** (Medicaid, SSI, waivers, and coverage gaps) [^f4ea1f79], and **community resources** (housing, transportation, respite, employment, and social supports) [^ec143606]. Confirm **communication and coordination** (team roles, records transfer, and follow-up) [^1c9fc468], **emergency and crisis plans** (24/7 contacts and protocols) [^f4ea1f79], and **outcome measurement** (how success is tracked and feedback is used) [^5561ac88]. These questions align with best practices and help ensure a safe, coordinated transition [^2ac3fd81].

---

## Assessment and planning

- **Readiness assessment**: What validated tool (e.g. TRAQ, STARx) will be used to assess transition readiness, how often will it be repeated, and how will results guide the plan? [^4a1789f9] [^f4ea1f79]

- **Individualized transition plan**: Will there be a written, individualized plan with goals, timeline, and assigned responsibilities, and who will lead its development and updates? [^f4ea1f79]

- **Adult provider identification**: How will adult providers be selected, what is their availability, and will there be pediatric consultation or joint visits to support continuity? [^9c1cf3a1] [^f4ea1f79]

---

## Legal and decision-making supports

Ask about **legal decision-making** — what options are available (guardianship, power of attorney, supported decision-making), which is least restrictive, and what documentation is needed now and at 18 [^08ed74e3] [^0bed92b1]. Also ask about **privacy and consent** — how will the team prepare for changes at 18, including consent, HIPAA, and information-sharing preferences [^f4ea1f79].

---

## Insurance and benefits

Ask about **insurance continuity** — how the team will ensure seamless coverage, including Medicaid, SSI, waivers, and managing any gaps during transition [^f4ea1f79]. Also ask about **financial assistance** — what programs are available to help with medical costs, equipment, and home care, and how to apply [^ec143606].

---

## Community resources and supports

Ask about **housing and independent living** — what supported housing or independent living options exist, what is the application process, and what supports are provided [^notfound]. Ask about **transportation** — how will medical and community transportation be arranged and funded [^109edec3]. Ask about **respite and home care** — what respite, personal care, and home health services are available, how to qualify, and how to access them [^ec143606]. Ask about **employment and education** — what vocational rehabilitation, job training, and post-secondary education supports are available [^notfound].

---

## Communication and coordination

Ask about **care coordination** — who will coordinate services across health, education, and community systems, and how will families be engaged [^1c9fc468]. Ask about **information transfer** — how will medical records, summaries, and care plans be shared with adult providers and community agencies [^f4ea1f79]. Ask about **follow-up and monitoring** — how will the team track progress after transfer and what supports exist if issues arise [^5561ac88].

---

## Emergency and crisis planning

Ask about **emergency protocols** — what 24/7 emergency contacts, crisis plans, and protocols are in place for medical, behavioral, and social crises [^notfound]. Ask about **medication and equipment** — how will the team ensure uninterrupted access to medications, supplies, and durable medical equipment during and after transfer [^12ecb0ce].

---

## Evaluation and quality improvement

Ask about **outcome measurement** — how will the program measure success (e.g. attendance, adherence, quality of life) and how will family feedback be collected and used [^80653d7a] [^5561ac88]. Ask about **continuous improvement** — how will the team use data and feedback to improve the transition process and address barriers [^f0ad9100].

### Transition: a future promise for children and adolescents with special health care needs and disabilities [^66586fe4]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Transitions are a part of everyone's life experience. Most young people with special health care needs and disabilities (SHCN/D) become independent partners in adult society, but some need deliberate guidance and support. This latter group is growing in number. Through a new consensus statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the U.S. Federal Government (Healthy People 2010), society is recognizing the need to assist young people with SHCN/D in attaining their potential in adulthood. This article discusses the growing number of young people with SHCN/D, their desires for their transition, the definition and areas of transition that should be addressed, and the key elements of successful transition programs. The article ends with a suggested list of actions a health care professional can undertake to foster a successful transition and a selected list of helpful resources for health professionals, families, and young people with SHCN/D.

### Improving health care transitions for children and youth with special health care needs [^430dc736]. Academic Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Health care transitions (HCT) from pediatric to adult health care remain a challenge for children and youth with special health care needs (CYSHCN), their families and their clinicians. While the HCT literature has expanded, gaps remain in how to improve health outcomes during transitions. HCTs broadly encompass three key domain areas: transition planning, transfer to adult health care clinicians or an adult model of care, and integration into an adult care/model of care. The CYSHCNet national research agenda development process, described in a previous article, prioritized several key research areas to address deficiencies in the HCT process. The highest priority questions identified were "What are the best models to accomplish youth-adult transition planning? How might this translate to other transitions (eg, to new clinicians, new settings, new schools, etc.)?" and "How do gaps in insurance and community supports during early adulthood effect CYSHCN health outcomes, and how can they be reduced?". Based upon these priorities, we describe the current state of transition research and recommendations for future investigation. Recommendations: The authors recommend 3 primary areas of investigation: 1) Understanding the optimal development and implementation of HCT service models in partnership with youth and families to improve transition readiness and transfer 2) Defining the process and outcome measures that capture adequacy of transition-related activities and 3) Evaluating fiscal policies that incentivize the processes of transition readiness development, transfer to adult health care services, and continuity of care within an adult health care setting. This article explores approaches within each research domain.

### A consensus statement on health care transitions for young adults with special health care needs [^670bd207]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

This policy statement represents a consensus on the critical first steps that the medical profession needs to take to realize the vision of a family-centered, continuous, comprehensive, coordinated, compassionate, and culturally competent health care system that is as developmentally appropriate as it is technically sophisticated. The goal of transition in health care for young adults with special health care needs is to maximize lifelong functioning and potential through the provision of high-quality, developmentally appropriate health care services that continue uninterrupted as the individual moves from adolescence to adulthood. This consensus document has now been approved as policy by the boards of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine.

### Effectiveness of a health-social partnership program for discharged non-frail older adults: a pilot study [^faf2deaf]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have shown that some hospital-based transitional care or discharge planning programs provide a health-social team to support older adults immediately after discharge. However, the results showed that their health and social care needs remain unmet due to the fragmentation of services and the diversity in intervention objectives provided by the health care team and social workers. The World Health Organization World Alliance for Patient Safety reiterated that improving coordination and communication among different professions should be the first priority for providing quality of care to patients. Some developed countries, such as the United Kingdom and Sweden, have recognized the importance of the health-social partnership and integrated it into policy, though results reported in the literature have shown that professionals in these countries are often unaware of their roles and responsibilities and the best evidence they can draw on when working with other disciplines. A recent review showed that although some studies used the term 'collaborative care' in the transitional care program, they failed to develop a well-structured model to help different disciplines work together.

This study endeavors to build a community-based health-social partnership program and subject it to empirical testing to support non-frail older adults in living to their fullest with optimum quality of life in their own environment after hospital discharge. We hypothesize that a properly functioning health-social team that provides comprehensive assessment in a home-based environment, strengthens self-care ability, and furnishes available community resources might improve quality of life among non-frail community-dwelling older adults. If proven successful, this model can be sustained in the community and bring us a step closer to the goal of successful aging in place.

### Parent-provider-community partnerships: optimizing outcomes for children with disabilities [^507f1e9a]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Children with disabilities and their families have multifaceted medical, developmental, educational, and habilitative needs that are best addressed through strong partnerships among parents, providers, and communities. However, traditional health care systems are designed to address acute rather than chronic conditions. Children with disabilities require high-quality medical homes that provide care coordination and transitional care, and their families require social and financial supports. Integrated community systems of care that promote participation of all children are needed. The purpose of this clinical report is to explore the challenges of developing effective community-based systems of care and to offer suggestions to pediatricians and policy-makers regarding the development of partnerships among children with disabilities, their families, and health care and other providers to maximize health and well-being of these children and their families.

### Supporting the health care transition from adolescence to adulthood in the medical home [^b7ee04b6]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Mental and behavioral health conditions — Youth with mental or behavioral health conditions face substantial adversity during transition; mental health conditions often peak during young adulthood and impair one's ability for self-care and participation in routine medical or mental health care or decision-making; shortages of mental and/or behavioral health clinicians are pervasive with many lacking a regular source of care, leading to higher risk of dropping out of care as well as employment, education, stable housing, and relationships; transition planning is most helpful when clinics incorporate active preparation, outreach, self-advocacy supports, and partnerships with families, clinicians, and community supports to bridge service gaps.

### Stemming the rising toll of people living with complex care needs [^5d8c639f]. JAMA Health Forum (2020). High credibility.

There is rigorous evidence that interventions targeting specific individuals at especially vulnerable times have positively changed the trajectories of their lives and substantially benefited society. The Nurse Family Partnership, for example, provides first-time, low income mothers with home visits by nurses throughout their pregnancies and until their children reach 2 years of age. This program, designed to improve health outcomes for mothers and children while promoting economic self-sufficiency, has improved both short-term outcomes (eg, significant reductions in preterm deliveries) and longer-term outcomes (eg, higher graduation rates among children in this program compared with similar at-risk youth), with an estimated savings to individuals and communities of $18 000 per participant after accounting for the program's costs.

Over time, both individuals and communities inevitably confront the accumulation of health challenges associated with aging that require different micro-level and macro-level solutions. Project HOME addresses the drivers of homelessness in North Philadelphia through housing investments, integrated health services, and life skills to build a community for individuals experiencing chronic physical and behavioral health conditions. This nonprofit organization has created nearly 1000 housing units since its inception in 1989 and now supports 550 jobs annually while fostering housing stability and improved health outcomes for community members.

The Transitional Care Model, an advanced practice registered nurse-coordinated, team-based intervention, seeks to interrupt the downward trajectory of chronic illness that contributes to older adults' frequent use of costly services. In addition to assuring access to health and social services to meet immediate goals and needs, this model has demonstrated longer-term outcomes by having the same advanced practice registered nurse provide continuity of care across diverse teams and settings. In multiple studies, the Transitional Care Model has demonstrated improvements in older adults' care experience, health, and quality of life, with estimated yearly net savings of $4500 per older adult.

While scholars continue to debate the value of micro-level vs macro-level solutions, we believe strongly that both are critical to success. Thus, public and private investments in innovations designed to address the foundation of health inequities as well as health care models targeting those suffering the devastating consequences of a lifetime of health assaults should both be a priority. These investments, however, should be informed by a systematic assessment of lessons learned from studies of existing innovations, including programs that did and did not meet desired objectives.

### Improving transitions in care for children with complex and medically fragile needs: a mixed methods study [^b85ddf8f]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Health care providers reported a paucity of knowledge of specific formal guidelines or policies to guide transitions from hospital to home for children with complex care needs. However, informal processes within each discipline were followed and many teams had developed their own discharge planning tools to ensure all appropriate actions and processes were taken to ensure smooth transitions in care. While there are a number of recommendations and guidelines aimed at the supporting the care management of this population, there remains a limited number of empirically evaluated programs and interventions informing the transition from hospital to home. Although the transition process should be customized to the individualized needs of children and families, overarching guidelines and structures should to be in place to ensure timely transition planning and continuity in care. However, to ensure the development of relevant, comprehensive, and sustainable policy recommendations, engaging a variety of key stakeholder is crucial. Leveraging research techniques to bring family experiences and perspectives to the forefront of decision making is essential to ensuring family-oriented practice and policy changes are pursued. Further, adopting an integrated knowledge translation approach by partnering with knowledge users throughout the research process can help ensure the knowledge being co-created will be relevant to their needs, and therefore more likely to be adopted into practice and policy. The recommendations stemming from this study were developed by integrating the experiential knowledge from families with the perspectives of stakeholders across the tertiary care, community care, and government sectors. Results from this research serves as a critical foundation for future intervention and program design to support the entire care team, including health care providers, administrators, and families, during the often complex, dynamic, and unique transition from the hospitalized setting back into a child's home and home community.

### Transition care for children with special health care needs [^3d66c807]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Approximately 750,000 children in the United States with special health care needs will transition from pediatric to adult care annually. Fewer than half receive adequate transition care.

Methods

We had conversations with key informants representing clinicians who provide transition care, pediatric and adult providers of services for individuals with special health care needs, policy experts, and researchers; searched online sources for information about currently available programs and resources; and conducted a literature search to identify research on the effectiveness of transition programs.

Results

We identified 25 studies evaluating transition care programs. Most (n = 8) were conducted in populations with diabetes, with a smaller literature (n = 5) on transplant patients. We identified an additional 12 studies on a range of conditions, with no more than 2 studies on the same condition. Common components of care included use of a transition coordinator, a special clinic for young adults in transition, and provision of educational materials.

Conclusions

The issue of how to provide transition care for children with special health care needs warrants further attention. Research needs are wide ranging, including both substantive and methodologic concerns. Although there is widespread agreement on the need for adequate transition programs, there is no accepted way to measure transition success. It will be essential to establish consistent goals to build an adequate body of literature to affect practice.

### Supporting the health care transition from adolescence to adulthood in the medical home [^2ac3fd81]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Six Core Elements of Health Care Transition (HCT) — development, phases, tools, and versions: After the publication of the 2011 clinical report, a structured clinical approach with sample tools called the "Six Core Elements of Health Care Transition" was developed for all youth, and from 2011 to 2013, 5 learning collaboratives tested the approach, including one in the District of Columbia involving teams from 3 academic health centers. In 2020, the Six Core Elements were updated. The Six Core Elements is not a model of care but a structured process customizable to many transition care models, and all 3 phases of transition support — preparation, transfer, and integration into adult health care — are included. The package includes customizable sample tools for primary and specialty care, 2 process measurement tools (the Current Assessment of HCT Activities and the HCT Process Measurement Tool), and a feedback measurement tool (the Transition Feedback Survey for Youth, Young Adults, and Parents and/or Caregivers). In addition, a recently validated transition experience tool is available for 16- and 17-year-olds with chronic conditions, and the Six Core Elements are packaged into 3 different versions.

### Supporting the health care transition from adolescence to adulthood in the medical home [^ed31ff83]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Health care transition (HCT) infrastructure — "the following recommendations are called for": clinicians and systems of care "are essential" in preparing youth, and "The following actions can support safe and effective transition", including to integrate HCTs into routine preventive, primary, specialty and subspecialty, and mental and/or behavioral health care, support quality improvement (QI) processes to implement the Six Core Elements, incorporate HCT support as a recommended element in medical home and health home recognition and certification programs (including the National Committee for Quality Assurance, The Joint Commission, and the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission), articulate specific HCT roles and responsibilities, increase the availability and quality of care coordination support, integrate HCT support into other life course systems (education, guardianship, and power of attorney), expand pediatric consultation for adult clinicians, incorporate HCTs into transition policies and plans of other public program systems, and create up-to-date listings of community resources and adult clinicians for young adults with pediatric-onset conditions and other special populations.

### Psychosocial factors in children and youth with special health care needs and their families [^750079fb]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Psychosocial factors in children and youth with special health care needs (CYSHCN) are addressed through practice strategies that include the following directive actions using the source's language: "Use team-based care strategies, care protocols, and dedicated care coordinators (if available) to recognize psychosocial protective factors and ameliorate risk factors", noting that "This strategy may involve collocation, consultation, comanagement, and/or integration with behavioral health specialists as part of medical home and specialty care teams". Clinicians should "Consider strategies for working with child care and school staff to monitor progress, reduce absences, and improve learning experiences and academic performance for CYSHCN". Payment and systems efforts include to "Advocate for flexible payment redesign with Medicaid and other insurers", since "Payment redesign may better support wellness and chronic care management for CYSHCN and their families", and "Flexible payment redesign may include payments for mental health treatment, care coordination, and collocation or comanagement with behavioral health and other specialists or disciplines". Programmatic care improvements include to "Promote evidence-based interventions and strategies in the medical home and subspecialty settings to support psychosocial development of CYSHCN, parenting competencies, and family resilience", and to "Advocate for community-based resources and strategies to address SDH and the reduction of disparities for CYSHCN and their families", where SDH denotes social determinants of health. Partnerships are encouraged, as "Pediatric providers and state AAP chapters can partner with Title V Maternal and Child Health CYSHCN programs in supporting implementation of the Association of Maternal and Child Health Program's Standards for Systems of Care for CYSHCN", and "These standards include increasing access for CYSHCN to quality medical homes, ease of use of community services, and transitioning across the life span", with AAP defined as the American Academy of Pediatrics.

### Improving transition from pediatric to adult cystic fibrosis care: lessons from a national survey of current practices [^e5aca186]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

More than 500,000 adolescents with special health care needs age into adulthood each year in the United States, and there is growing recognition of the need for support of their transition to adult-oriented health care. Because of improved survival, cystic fibrosis has experienced this increasing transition need, and cystic fibrosis policy leaders responded by mandating the transition of adults with cystic fibrosis to adult-focused cystic fibrosis care programs by 2000. The primary objective of this study was to characterize in detail recent transition practices at US cystic fibrosis programs, to identify areas for improvement and to serve as a model for other diseases. A secondary objective of this study was to develop and validate a survey for formal assessment of transition practices.

Methods

A 105-question survey on key aspects of transition was administered to cystic fibrosis care team members from all 195 US Cystic Fibrosis Care programs. Rates of adherence to recommended components of transition care were measured.

Results

A total of 448 surveys were obtained from 170 (87%) of 195 cystic fibrosis programs. Although transfer of care occurs at a median age of 19 years, initial discussion of transition does not occur until a median age of 17 years, limiting time to foster self-care skills. Only half of programs consistently perform a transition readiness assessment, 28% of centers offer visits focused on transition, and < 10% have a written list of desirable self-management skills.

Conclusions

There is significant variability in transition support provided to young adults with cystic fibrosis, but there are simple steps that may lead to more consistent delivery of transition services. Methods of assessment and lessons learned from transitioning young adults at US cystic fibrosis programs may serve to improve transition for individuals with other childhood diseases.

### Self-management and transition to adult health care in adolescents and young adults: a team process [^f0ad9100]. Pediatrics in Review (2017). Low credibility.

As health care continues to evolve, the need for more effective health care transition (HCT) for all youth, but particularly children with chronic conditions and special health care needs, becomes even more important. With more than 90% of adolescents with chronic medical conditions now surviving into adulthood, suboptimal transition can lead to poorer quality of life and less successful adulthood. Through a series of clinical vignettes, the challenges of HCT are presented herein and accompanied by comments that underscore how these adolescents can best be helped to transition to successful adulthood. Several methods are presented to assess the readiness of adolescents and young adults (AYA) for transition. The process of transition can be divided into 3 stages: 1) setting the stage: initiation of HCT services and transition readiness assessment, 2) moving forward: ongoing provision of HCT services, and 3) reaching the goal: transfer of care and transition to adulthood. Several valuable suggestions for incorporating the HCT process into the health care system and improving HCT programs through a quality improvement (QI) approach are outlined. Future challenges in HCT include developing more precise assessments of transition status or transition readiness, better understanding the status and specific needs of AYA with chronic health care needs, continued program evaluation and QI efforts, and more reliance on patients and families to teach us about the challenges and methods in HCT that most effectively work for them.

### Considerations for alternative decision-making when transitioning to adulthood for youth with intellectual and developmental disabilities: policy statement [^08ed74e3]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Case vignette — pediatric transition decision-making assessment: During the latest visit, the pediatrician meets with the adolescent alone to understand her medical needs and preferences, and the patient values her parents' support in navigating the medical system and making medical decisions. As part of the visit, the pediatrician and patient review daily living activities and explore needed assistance for decision-making, asking about goals for health, ability to communicate medical problems, anticipated need for parental help when grown, medication dosing/purpose/administration, being left alone, what to do if hurt or sick without parents present, interest in life or job skills training, and whether she signed her own employment contract. The pediatrician also gathers parent input; combined responses suggest the patient can manage day-to-day decisions with some parental support, and although she does not know the purpose of some medications, she demonstrates understanding when explained. Options discussed include a supported decision-making agreement, along with requesting electronic health record proxy access, allowing clinicians to speak with parents, and providing clear written recommendations to share after each visit. The pediatrician explains that a least-restrictive approach may be more appropriate than guardianship, provides resources including a medical legal partnership group, notes that a power of attorney will legally allow parental support for decisions needing assistance and that the specifics vary by state, and allows time for questions while assessing understanding and comfort with next steps.

### Guiding principles for team-based pediatric care [^1c9fc468]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Guiding principles for pediatric care teams — an ideal pediatric care team acknowledges that children and families are key team members and partners; recognizes that pediatricians are the ideal leaders of team-based care for children, with the locus of leadership that may shift over time and be shared when appropriate, and that the team's composition and pediatrician leadership will change as needs change; assesses child and family needs and available resources and works to address system gaps, establishing professional partnerships, community linkages, and collaborations for complex challenges; communicates in an effective and timely fashion among all team members with the child and family at the center; extends the foundation of the medical home by facilitating interactions and cooperation among primary care pediatricians and other participants, with subspecialists, therapists, and others helping meet goals via shared decision-making and planning; and incorporates the 5 key elements of a high-functioning team: shared goals, clear roles, mutual trust, effective communication, and measurable processes and outcomes.

### Health-care transition: a vital part of care, growth, and change for pediatric patients [^84b5caab]. Pediatrics in Review (2021). Medium credibility.

Preparing all youth for the transition to adult-oriented care, adulthood itself, and a greater responsibility for their own health and health-care is an essential part of pediatric care. This process, typically described as health-care transition, can occur throughout ongoing pediatric health-care to prepare patients for transfer to an adult clinician and integration into adult care. Gaps remain in practice and in outcomes research regarding health-care transition. This review discusses recent literature, details best practices, and recommends guidance and tools to assist pediatric clinicians in providing a smooth transition process and a successful transfer to adult care for youth with and without special health-care needs.

### A community-based health-social partnership program for community-dwelling older adults: a hybrid effectiveness-implementation pilot study [^6edd7ea4]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Promoting the program among staff

The participating manager re-echoed a need to reach out to all staff members and promote the program among them. In this way, staff members are kept abreast with firsthand information about the study as well as offering an opportunity to respond to other issues they may have so they can in turn be able to participate in the program:

"Instead of us calling the members, it would be better if the research team could organize a briefing session in the community center. In the briefing session, the research team could talk about the aims, benefits, and requirements of the program. The research team members are the ideal people to answer questions from our members regarding the details of the program". – [Community center staff manager].

Consensus building and communication

Staff manager participants highlighted building consensus and communication as key ingredients to facilitate the adoption and implementation of a new program. Participants reiterated that this involved good-faith efforts to attain unanimous agreement between the research and service delivery teams to facilitate smooth implementation of the program. Participants recounted and reflected on previous experiences with the research team in a positive light and felt this may help to drive the collaboration forward to support the adoption of the program:

"There were a lot of things to discuss before we could adopt the program here. Whether the mission and vision of the program are consistent with ours, the logistics and manpower issues, the equipment and instruments needed… The research–service team members have to reach a consensus before the program can be launched smoothly. In fact, we think that our experience of working with the research team was good because we had several fruitful discussions beforehand". – [Community center staff manager].

Regarding communication, the providers' comments echoed the opinion of the community center staff manager, although the providers' main focus was the interaction among the health–social partnership team members. The providers noted a need for constant communication across the service delivery team before, during, and after the implementation of the program:

"Regular communication among the health–social partnership team members is crucial before the commencement of the program, as well as during and after the program. We learned to clearly understand each other's working styles, roles, and responsibilities. When any participant's condition changed, we could revise our action plans and protocols during our group meetings. The revised protocols are stored in the community center for reference". – [Provider].

### What constitutes successful commissioning of transition from children's to adults' services for young people with long-term conditions and what are the challenges? An interview study [^699b41ea]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2017). Medium credibility.

Results

Forty-six interviewees were approached; 29 agreed to participate. The participants covered a range of roles across the target population (table 3). Reasons for non-participation were: no response to email or email follow-up, change in role and lack of time to participate.

Table 3
Summary description of the participants

Successful transition

While no single definition of successful transition emerged, some key characteristics were described (table 4). These included that transition should: (i) be personalised; (ii) be planned, coordinated and collaborative; (iii) focus on broad developmental and life outcomes; (iv) build pathways from children's services to adults' services rather than just rely on individual single solutions; (v) ensure coordination and continuity of relationships and knowledge across sectors and life domains rather than just transfer young people from one service to another; and (vi) use universal services such as GPs where possible with tailored enhanced support as required.

Box 1
Selected quotes about perceived characteristics of successful transition

Personalised, planned, coordinated, collaborative with focused on broad developmental and life outcomes:

"… what all the legislation is telling us, and all the national direction is about, is about personalisation.… [in current practice] we keep on just focusing on the here and now. What we should be doing is… predict what the needs will be in the future… " (Commissioner/related manager 1, Regional)

"… a smooth journey and needs met.… the much wider picture. So your health needs will impact on your employment outcomes or your education… and what you do with your aspirations within your community… " (Member 1 of transition planning workforce, Regional)

"… I think successful transition… has to be addressed and introduced as a concept at the age of 14+ school review… then the families, and the young people, and the professionals begin, hopefully, to develop some type of joint work between them… " (Voluntary sector leader, National)

Builds pathways, ensures continuity and uses universal services:

"… if the systems were right, so if you had children's services interfaced properly into adult services there was a clear pathway… children would just sort of flow through… " (Commissioner/related manager 1, Regional)

### Supporting the health care transition from adolescence to adulthood in the medical home [^fa6a5e00]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Health care transition measurement and supports — evaluation studies often fail to incorporate conceptual frameworks, clinical recommendations, and international consensus statements; studies have identified a variety of transition outcome variables, and there is no common agreement on which variables should be measured; major agencies have identified the need for more robust and consistent measurement; using the triple aim approach that includes quality of care, patient and clinician experience, and use/cost measures can offer a framework; patients who are more activated have better health outcomes and care experiences, with activation measurable via the Patient Activation Measure or assessment of health confidence and motivation; readiness and self-care assessment tools with scorable questions can improve patient activation; care coordination is commonly associated with increased transition planning activities.

Transition Process

Following two rounds of surveys, 15 of the proposed statements concerning the facilitation of safe and smooth handover of care to adult services achieved consensus with the level of agreement ranging from 84 to 100% (Table 1). These recommendations propose gradually building young patients' preparedness through measures such as starting the transition process early and offering communication with both paediatric and adult care teams in the year before transfer. The recommendations also include tailoring transition programs to the young patients' needs — reviewing diagnostic evaluations and management plans prior to transfer and ensuring multidisciplinary follow-up as appropriate. Five statements did not reach consensus (level of agreement ranging from 57% of respondents to 78%) (Supplementary Table 2).

Table 1
Recommendations for the process of transition

Administration of Transition

Following two rounds of surveys, 14 statements regarding the effective and efficient implementation of transition programs reached consensus with the level of agreement ranging from 84 to 100% (Table 2). These guidelines recommend prompt handover of all relevant patient information including medical records, involvement in past or current research, and follow-up plans prior to the young person's first appointment in adult services. Respondents also recommended that transition programs take an interdisciplinary approach — linking in young patients and caregivers with relevant healthcare professionals and community resources such as patient advocacy groups and youth workers to support with illness and adolescence-related concerns. Four statements did not reach consensus (level of agreement ranging from 70% of respondents to 77%) (Supplementary Table 2).

Table 2
Recommendations for the administration of transition programmes

Transition Appointments

All eight proposed statements concerning the organisation of transition consultations to gradually increase the young patients' involvement in their healthcare reached consensus with the level of agreement ranging from 90 to 100% (Table 3). These recommendations propose holding joint transition appointments with paediatric and adult clinicians to build the patients' familiarity with the adult care team. It is also recommended to support greater patient autonomy through 1:1 consultations with physicians, seeking their consent to share information with caregivers as appropriate, and asking them to re-consent to research they have been enrolled in by caregivers.

### Evidence supporting the effectiveness of transition programs for youth with special health care needs [^1289d676]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2017). Low credibility.

More than 90% of adolescents and young adults with chronic medical conditions will survive into adulthood. Transitioning from pediatric to adult health care services for these individuals has often times been associated with deterioration of their health and Quality of Life. Separation from their pediatric provider and lack of preparedness of the adult health care system has been identified as major barriers in preventing the successful transition of these individuals. The purpose of this review is to summarize the available data related to transitioning adolescents and young adults (AYA) with special health care needs into the adult health care system.

### Improving transitions in care for children with complex and medically fragile needs: a mixed methods study [^a2131976]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Due to the complex nature of their care needs, these children often experience frequent hospitalizations, accounting for approximately 10% of pediatric admissions and 25% of hospital days. In comparison to children without complex chronic conditions, children with medical complexity experience almost 9 times more inpatient visits and 17 times greater inpatient costs. Despite this high inpatient use, it is widely recognized that much of the care these children require could be provided in their home and home communities. With as many as 89% of children with complex chronic conditions being discharged from hospitalized settings, a well-coordinated and comprehensive transition from hospital to home is essential for improved patient and family outcomes and efficient use of health care resources. However, successful transitions in care for this population are characterized by a number of challenges. As many as 13 physicians from 6 distinct medical specialities and numerous other care team members across the health, educational, and community settings may be involved in the care of these children and families. This sizable care team extending across multiple services and sectors creates the potential for gaps in care coordination and communication. In addition to these factors, their care needs may include dependence on medical technology at discharge (i.e. ventilator, feeding tubes, etc.), requiring adequate support in their home community which can place this vulnerable population at an even greater risk for adverse outcomes or hospital re-admissions, particularly in geographically dispersed communities. There has been increasing discussion in the literature over the past 10 years surrounding pediatric complex care, including new models of service delivery to support children with complex care needs and their families in the community. The American Academy of Pediatrics has advocated for the Medical Home Model, grounded in family-centered primary care services, as a comprehensive, community based model of service for all children with complex care needs and their families. However, current health care structures in North American are not designed to effectively support these principles of care.

### Planning for health care transitions: results from the 2005–2006 national survey of children with special health care needs [^a0719596]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Many youth with special health care needs have difficulties transferring to adult medical care. To address this, the Maternal and Child Health Bureau has made receipt of transition services a core performance outcome for community-based systems of care for youth with special health care needs. In this article we describe the results for the transition core outcome from the 2005–2006 National Survey of Children With Special Health Care Needs. We also describe changes in the measurement strategy for this outcome since the first National Survey of Children With Special Health Care Needs in 2001.

Methods

In the nationally representative, cross-sectional 2005–2006 National Survey of Children With Special Health Care Needs, parent or guardian respondents of 18198 youth with special health care needs (aged 12–17) were asked if they have had discussions with their child's health care providers about (1) future adult providers, (2) future adult health care needs, (3) changes in health insurance, and (4) encouraging their child to take responsibility for his or her care. All 4 components had to be met for the youth to meet the overall transition core outcome. Those who had not had transition discussions reported if such discussions would have been helpful.

Results

Overall, 41% of youth with special health care needs met the core performance outcome for transition. Forty-two percent had discussed shifting care to an adult provider, 62% discussed their child's adult health care needs, and 34% discussed upcoming changes in health insurance. Most (78%) respondents said that providers usually or always encourage their child to take responsibility for his or her health. Non-Hispanic black or Hispanic race/ethnicity, lower income level, not speaking English, and not having a medical home reduced the odds of meeting the transition core outcome.

Conclusions

Current performance on the transition core outcome leaves much room for improvement. Many parents feel that having transition-related discussions with their health care providers would be helpful. Future clinical and policy-level research should be directed at identifying barriers to, and recommending content for, health transition discussions.

### International and interdisciplinary identification of health care transition outcomes [^80653d7a]. JAMA Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

There is a lack of agreement on what constitutes successful outcomes for the process of health care transition (HCT) among adolescent and young adults with special health care needs.

Objective

To present HCT outcomes identified by a Delphi process with an interdisciplinary group of participants.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A Delphi method involving 3 stages was deployed to refine a list of HCT outcomes. This 18-month study (from January 5, 2013, of stage 1 to July 3, 2014, of stage 3) included an initial literature search, expert interviews, and then 2 waves of a web-based survey. On this survey, 93 participants from outpatient, community-based, and primary care clinics rated the importance of the top HCT outcomes identified by the Delphi process. Analyses were performed from July 5, 2014, to December 5, 2014.

Exposures

Health care transition outcomes of adolescents and young adults with special health care needs.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Importance ratings of identified HCT outcomes rated on a Likert scale from 1 (not important) to 9 (very important).

Results

The 2 waves of surveys included 117 and 93 participants as the list of outcomes was refined. Transition outcomes were refined by the 3 waves of the Delphi process, with quality of life being the highest-rated outcome with broad agreement. The 10 final outcomes identified included individual outcomes (quality of life, understanding the characteristics of conditions and complications, knowledge of medication, self-management, adherence to medication, and understanding health insurance), health services outcomes (attending medical appointments, having a medical home, and avoidance of unnecessary hospitalization), and a social outcome (having a social network). Participants indicated that different outcomes were likely needed for individuals with cognitive disabilities.

Conclusions and Relevance

Quality of life is an important construct relevant to HCT. Future research should identify valid measures associated with each outcome and further explore the role that quality of life plays in the HCT process. Achieving consensus is a critical step toward the development of reliable and objective comparisons of HCT outcomes across clinical conditions and care delivery locations.

### Transition planning among US youth with and without special health care needs [^3dddd66c]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Researchers have shown that most youth with special health care needs (YSHCN) are not receiving guidance on planning for health care transition. This study examines current transition planning among US youth with and without special health care needs (SHCN).

Methods

The 2016 National Survey of Children's Health is nationally representative and includes 20708 youth (12–17 years old). Parents and/or caregivers were asked if transition planning occurred, based on the following elements: (1) doctor or other health care provider (HCP) discussed the eventual shift to an HCP who cares for adults, (2) an HCP actively worked with youth to gain self-care skills or understand changes in health care at age 18, and (3) youth had time alone with an HCP during the last preventive visit. Sociodemographic and health system characteristics were assessed for associations with transition planning.

Results

Nationally, 17% of YSHCN and 14% of youth without SHCN met the overall transition measure. Older age (15–17 years) was the only sociodemographic factor associated with meeting the overall transition measure and individual elements for YSHCN and youth without SHCN. Other sociodemographic characteristics associated with transition planning differed among the 2 populations. Receipt of care coordination and a written plan was associated with transition planning for YSHCN.

Conclusions

This study reveals that few youth with and without SHCN receive transition planning support. It underscores the need for HCPs to work with youth independently and in collaboration with parents and/or caregivers throughout adolescence to gain self-care skills and prepare for adult-focused care.

### Supporting the health care transition from adolescence to adulthood in the medical home [^8a9e2a8f]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Status of transition preparation and outcome among US youth — The vast majority of US youth are not receiving transition preparation, according to the 2020–2021 National Survey of Children's Health, with new estimates for youth (ages 12 through 17) showing that 84% of youth with special health care needs (SHCN) and 80% of youth without special needs do not meet the national health care transition (HCT) performance measure. The composite measure examines whether (1) youth had time alone to speak with the doctor or other health care clinician during his or her last preventive visit; (2) the doctor or other health care clinician worked with youth to gain self-care skills or understand the changes in health care that happen at 18 years of age; and (3) the doctor or other health care clinician talked with youth about eventually seeing doctors who treat adults. These estimates are lower than past national studies of youth with SHCN, and the previous National Survey of Children with Special Needs (in 2009–2010) assessed whether parents perceived a need for discussion of specific transition topics.

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). High credibility.

Best practice recommendations and summary — program guidance states that a structured transition program is associated with improved health outcomes, patient experience, and utilization of health care. The team should confirm the youth's attendance at the first adult provider appointment and have a plan on how to work with the youth and adult provider if the youth fails to attend the appointment, and measuring health outcomes after transfer as well as eliciting feedback from the youth and parents about their experience may contribute to transition program improvements. Communicating with the adult team for feedback on the transfer event and to offer consultative services may help improve and streamline the transfer process, and the educational needs of parents/caregivers should be included in program development.

### Ongoing pediatric health care for the child who has been maltreated [^1eb25e6e]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Adolescents transitioning to adult health care after maltreatment — For adolescents who may be transitioning to adult health care, it is important to connect them with providers for both their physical and mental health needs; approximately 30% to 40% of the adolescents who have experienced child maltreatment are coping with mental health problems, and about one-third have a chronic illness or disability. Preparation for transitioning should start early: depending on their cognitive abilities, children 14 years or younger can be prepared and taught to manage their own care, and youth with special health care needs may require a longer transition process because issues such as guardianship and transfer of specialty care must be addressed; pediatricians can identify physicians in their community who are interested in working with adults with health care and mental health needs.

### Supporting the health care transition from adolescence to adulthood in the medical home [^6949a8db]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Optimal health care is achieved when each person, at every age, receives medically and developmentally appropriate care. The goal of a planned health care transition is to maximize lifelong functioning and well-being for all youth, including those who have special health care needs and those who do not. This process includes ensuring that high-quality, developmentally appropriate health care services are available in an uninterrupted manner as the person moves from adolescence to adulthood. A well-timed transition from child- to adult-oriented health care is specific to each person and ideally occurs between the ages of 18 and 21 years. Coordination of patient, family, and provider responsibilities enables youth to optimize their ability to assume adult roles and activities. This clinical report represents expert opinion and consensus on the practice-based implementation of transition for all youth beginning in early adolescence. It provides a structure for training and continuing education to further understanding of the nature of adolescent transition and how best to support it. Primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants, as well as medical subspecialists, are encouraged to adopt these materials and make this process specific to their settings and populations.

Continuity of care across transitions — Transitions in care "are common and are usually of great consequence" and occur across dimensions including "transition from pediatric to adult services", "from more intensive to less intensive levels of care", interagency and educational transitions, and "specialty care to primary care transitions and vice versa". Youth with complex needs or developmental disabilities "may not receive needed services during times of transition", placing them at risk for adverse outcomes; youth in foster care are "a particularly vulnerable population". Effective practice emphasizes partnering with families, "formally assessing youth readiness for the transition", supporting the youth and family, maintaining "strong provider — patient collaboration", giving foster-care leavers "proactive attention" to economic, educational, BH, and housing supports, and continuously assessing functioning while maintaining services and supports.

### Navigating transition to adulthood in epilepsy patients: a multidisciplinary approach [^4a1789f9]. Epilepsy Currents (2025). Medium credibility.

Advances in diagnostics and therapeutics have improved long-term survival in several pediatric diseases across subspecialties, making transition of care a broad necessity. Many transition needs are not disease-specific, signaling potential value for broadly applicable transition programs. These programs can consolidate resources, such as social, educational, and legal support, and are especially useful in resource-limited areas, and in managing rare diseases. One such program, the Center for Healthy Adolescent Transition (CHAT), developed at the Children's Hospital Los Angeles, provides transition case management, patient navigation, insurance, and legal support, and connects pediatric patients with adult providers.

Assessing transition readiness should be considered even in the absence of a formal transition program or clinic. Several tools help assess transition readiness. The Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire (TRAQ) is an easy-to-use, validated instrument that screens for transition readiness across 5 domains: managing medications, appointment keeping, tracking health issues, talking with providers, and the importance and confidence around healthcare self-management. While TRAQ provides a helpful overview of transition readiness, it is not specific to epilepsy. Clark et al developed a disease-specific transition screening tool, incorporating epilepsy-related questions based on input from the 2014 and 2017 AAN Quality Measures. This tool, known as EpiTRAQ, is validated for adolescents and young adults aged 16–26 years. It includes key epilepsy-specific questions related to seizure type, seizure frequency, anti-seizure medications, and counseling for women of childbearing potential with epilepsy. Additional readiness assessment tools include Am I ON TRAC for Adult Care, the Self-Management and Transition for Adulthood with Treatment (STARx), and Transition Q. –

### Improving transitions in care for children with complex and medically fragile needs: a mixed methods study [^82cf226f]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Knowledge / skills

The majority of participants were not aware of formal guidelines or policies to help support or inform the transition from hospital to home for children with medical complexity and their families. Guidelines that were discussed included the medical home model from the American Academy of Pediatrics, Toronto Sick Kids Complex Care Program, and condition-specific health centre policies. A number of health care providers indicated a lack of awareness of the range of resources accessible in the community and the tertiary care facility for both families and health care providers to support this transition in care. Further, given that some smaller communities may go many years in-between assuming care for a child with complex care needs, a lack of experience of how the transition process should occur was reported. Participants also mentioned specific psychomotor skills that may be required by the community health care providers to care for the complex medical needs of these children.

Behaviour regulation

Participants spoke of several systems and resources that could be used to support smoother, more effective, and efficient transitions from hospital to home for children with medical complexity and their families. This included: (1) prompt and consistent communication to the appropriate health care providers/services; (2) care coordinators located in the community and the tertiary care centre to oversee the coordination of care and support families; (3) teleconferences between all members of the care team; (4) written care plans provided to both families and providers in advance of discharge from the tertiary care facility; (5) access to additional speciality health care services within the community; and (6) online repository or system to store and organize existing community resources, pediatric tertiary care centre resources, policies, and clinical care guidelines.

Beliefs about capabilities

Health care providers highlighted the need for both expertise and confidence in caring for the complex pediatric population to ensure optimal care is provided. Given the rurality of many of these communities, community health care providers may have limited encounters with pediatric patients resulting in a decreased confidence in caring for their unique needs. Practitioners also spoke of the varying parental confidence levels during the shift in care responsibility. Parents must be adequately prepared to transition from a secure hospital environment to their homes where health care providers will not be directly overseeing their child at all times.

### Assessment of transition readiness in adolescents and young adults with chronic health conditions [^27414486]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In the United States, approximately 500,000 adolescents with special health care needs reach the age of 18 each year and ultimately need to transition from pediatric to adult health care. The transition from pediatric care to adult care is often a challenging time for patients with chronic medical conditions and their providers. Many adolescents and young adults lack important self-management and health care utilization skills and are insufficiently prepared to move to adult care. Gaps in health care can lead to increased morbidity and mortality.

A transition process which starts in early adolescence can help patients develop self-care, self-advocacy, and decision-making skills, and the need for such a process has been acknowledged. However, despite several efforts to improve the transition process, gaps remain. The 2001 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs (NS-CSHCN) found that only 15% of youth reported that their doctor had discussed changing needs in adulthood, including the need to transition to an adult doctor. A 2006 follow up NS-CSHCN survey identified that only 40% of youth reported meeting the medical transition outcome measure (a composite of whether the provider had discussed transition to adult care, health care needs, health insurance, and had encouraged the patient to take responsibility for his/her own care). A 2014 systematic review concluded that most published studies aiming to improve transition process failed to address the "triple aim" of impact on health outcomes, patient satisfaction, and cost. The Agency for Health Care Research and Quality (AHRQ) has acknowledged that identification of optimal transition processes and interventions are limited by the lack of a robust evidence base.

### Guiding principles for managed care arrangements for the health of newborns, infants, children, adolescents and young adults [^9f287526]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Children and youth with special care needs — Children and youth with special care needs represent a group of children with diverse chronic and complex conditions who use a disproportionate volume and intensity of health care services, and the managed care arrangements should support the primary care medical home's access to the necessary components of a treatment team of diverse expertise to support increased coordination, service integration, and services for children, youth, and their families that often existed outside of traditional medical systems. Examples include behavioral health integration into medical settings, dedicated care manager services for high-complexity patients, and partnerships with home health services, and payment arrangements should recognize the increased costs to provide effective care coordination for children with special health care needs, as well as children in foster care or enduring other adverse conditions. These populations are best served when eligibility and treatment policies are flexible and designed and implemented with expert pediatric input and when clear processes are in place for prior authorizations and appeals.

### Longitudinal evaluation of transition services ("LETS study"): protocol for outcome evaluation [^91ed54c8]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Effective transition of adolescents from pediatric to adult health services has become a prominent issue in health care research. As a result of unprecedented advances in medical practice over the past three decades, as many as 50–90% of children with congenital or acquired physical disabilities now reach adolescence and live into adulthood. For example, in 1995, twice as many newborns with spina bifida survived in the US as compared to 1975. Consequently, a new cohort of adults with childhood-onset disabilities and complex chronic conditions has emerged, requiring appropriate transitional care upon their "discharge" from pediatric facilities.

Transition from the pediatric to adult health care system is a complex process that must be addressed in a holistic manner inclusive of medical, psychosocial, educational, and vocational components. Ideally, health care during the period of transition should be delivered in a coordinated and uninterrupted manner through the provision of developmentally appropriate and comprehensive services. However, finding appropriate adult care is challenging, as many adult programs have eligibility criteria that focus on adults with new onset disability issues, and there is a general lack of expertise among most adult health care providers related to aging with a childhood-onset disability. In the absence of an adequate system of care, adolescents with disabilities are often significantly under-serviced as young adults, and many receive no care whatsoever.

Even when links to adult care are established, the process of transition remains difficult. First, there are important differences between the pediatric and adult health care environments, such as decreased family involvement and highly specialized, fragmented care that characterize the adult health care system. To succeed in this system, young people need to learn how to manage their own health. Unfortunately, the pediatric system has not emphasized developing the skills of children with disabilities to enable them to navigate the adult system that requires more self-advocacy and self-determination skills than the pediatric sector, where parents often play this role. Second, adolescence is a critical developmental phase between childhood and adulthood, characterized by increased socio-cultural turbulence and vulnerability for all adolescents, regardless of disability. Two of its hallmarks are a search for an identity separate from that of the family of origin and re-defining relationships with adults in parental and caring roles. These may contribute to tension in the relationships of adolescents with their families and health care providers.

### The individuals with disabilities education act (IDEA) for children with special educational needs [^680c4ae8]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) — entry into and transitions in services include linkage to early intervention (EI) or special education and coordination of EI-to-school supports. When a parent or health care provider discovers developmental problems or a disability, linkage to EI or special education will lead to receipt of special services, and for children already involved with EI and with an Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP), the IFSP team will usually ensure that the child's supports transition to special education as necessary, usually at 3 years of age. Ideally, members of the IFSP team will attend the Individualized Education Program (IEP) meeting at the child's school to share information and plan transition services, and discussing this transition with parents and a follow-up clinic visit or phone call can help this transition occur smoothly and ensure there is not a loss of services. Children from families who relocate to different schools or cities or from home schooling around transition points are especially at risk of losing educational services and supports.

### Health care transition for youth living with HIV / AIDS [^54c491b9]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

There are ~1 million people in the United States living with HIV/AIDS, and > 50,000 new infections occur each year. With an estimated 13% of all new infections occurring among young people aged 13 to 24 years and an increasing number of perinatally infected youth surviving to adulthood, there is now an increasing need to transition both perinatally and behaviorally infected youth to the adult health care setting. Recently, pediatric providers and professional societies have prioritized the development of transition programs for adolescents with chronic disease to address the many challenges these youth face in the process. Although multiple position papers have called for continuous, coordinated, culturally appropriate, compassionate, family-centered transition programs for youth with special health care needs and have recognized the need for evidence-based models, few data exist on what strategies are most effective. To date, published data on health care transition for HIV-positive youth are limited and include only 2 studies, which considered behaviorally infected youth. In this state-of-the-art review, we discuss the unique transition challenges to consider for this population, including socioeconomic and health insurance status, the special role of the pediatric or adolescent provider as family, stigma and disclosure issues, cognitive development and mental health issues, medication adherence, and sexual, reproductive, and gender health concerns. Future research will need to include the experiences of transition in low-resource settings and examine clinical outcomes and factors that may predict success or failure of the transition process.

Needs in transition

From a specialized pediatric team to a specialized adult team

Caring for a child with a chronic disease poses complex challenges in which the whole family is involved. The request for autonomy grows progressively during development and becomes pregnant in the transition to adulthood, during which the young person takes responsibility for his/her self: this step is also reflected in the transition between pediatric and adult care. The transition is configured as a planned and gradual process through which the adolescent passes from a child-centered care system to an adult-centered one. There are two main elements of this transition process that impact on its success: one is the passage of care from the primary caregiver (parent) to the patient, and the other is the transfer of responsibility from the pediatric gastroenterologist to one specialized in the care of adult subjects. Improving transition preparation skills, including knowledge of the disease, has the potential to reduce gaps in continuity of care. Indeed, discontinuation of care put adolescents at risk for poorer health-related outcomes, including higher levels of non-adherence and non-engagement, potential loss of follow-ups, increased risk of relapse of the disease, and poorer overall health.

The transition process was conceptualized as having a beginning (the decision to switch to an "adult care"), an intermediate period (preparation for the transition, developing the necessary skills and behaviors that support self-care; effective health decision making and self-help), and end (effective transfer of care from a pediatric to adult care).

The unpredictable course and the possible complications that characterize IBDs include a great variety of events whose nature can also be embarrassing with repercussions on the quality of life and some psychological, social, and physical aspects.

Psychology in transition

In the transition between adolescence and young adulthood, adolescents can express their disputed discomfort between the anxiety of leaving a well-known reference doctor and the need for independence and control over their illness. They need effective communication, education, and more information to facilitate their independent control.

Adolescents live relevant changes in their body, self-image, and identity. Therefore, they could feel as not treated as an adult, which can compromise the alliance on the ward. In this direction, they ask for advice on contraception, alcohol, smoking. Finally, a complex transition is often related to a dependent personality or anxiety, where parents use to manage the illness.

Limitations of transition readiness tools in TS — "many limitations exist", including "a paucity of research examining a broad spectrum of health outcomes" and that most research "has focused mainly on the number of follow-up appointments and/or drop-out of care". Although tools are designed to assess progress over time, "longitudinal studies have not been conducted". Perspectives may differ, with "conflicting readiness scores reported by patients versus caregivers", and "it is not clear how clinicians should address these discrepancies". Implementation gaps persist as "transition discussions are inconsistent… and that transition tools are not routinely used in TS care".

### Toward a better understanding of transition from paediatric to adult care in type 1 diabetes: a qualitative study of adolescents [^0da070df]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

Type 1 diabetes is associated with significant morbidity, with an increasing risk of acute diabetes-related complications in adolescence and emerging adulthood. Purposeful transition from paediatric to adult-oriented care could mitigate this risk but is often lacking. Detailed understanding of the perspectives of adolescents in their final year of paediatric care is essential to inform delivery of transition care programs.

Methods

We conducted semi-structured interviews with adolescents (aged 17 years) with type 1 diabetes at an academic institution from April 2017 to May 2018. Participants were recruited through convenience sampling. Sixty-one interviews were transcribed for analysis. Coding followed the principles of thematic analysis.

Results

Thirty-six percent of participants were male, and participants were from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. We found three overarching themes in our analysis: first, difficulties navigating changing relationships with parents and healthcare teams; second, the need to increase type 1 diabetes self-management and differing comfort levels based on age of diagnosis; and third, perceived responsibilities for transition care preparation (for both the paediatric team and adolescents themselves) focused not only on type 1 diabetes-specific skills but also on healthcare system structures.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that novel transition programs addressing changing inter-personal relationships, disease-specific self-management (adapted for age of diagnosis), and healthcare system navigation, supported by parents and peers, may be needed to improve transition care for adolescents with type 1 diabetes.

Turner syndrome — transition from pediatric to adult care: We recommend an intentional, defined, individualized pathway to transition from pediatric to adult care for adolescents with TS beginning in early adolescence. We suggest a formal assessment of transition readiness at multiple timepoints of the individual and/or caregiver/support person to identify specific needs and barriers to successful transition. We suggest that developmentally appropriate, organ systems-based assessments and counseling occurs during transition, ensuring that these elements are documented upon transfer. We suggest that pediatric health care teams transition individuals with TS to adult providers with expertise to manage TS comorbidities.

### Supporting the health care transition from adolescence to adulthood in the medical home [^9c1cf3a1]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Transition logistics — sequencing and care coordination — are described with conditional language: Transferring to adult primary care clinicians could be the initial transfer so the adult care clinicians can assist in locating and/or coordinating adult subspecialty or behavioral care clinicians, as needed. In transitioning youth with certain chronic conditions, the interplay between pediatric subspecialists and the transfer to adult primary care and/or subspecialty clinicians can vary according to the youth's needs and availability of adult care clinicians with appropriate specialty knowledge, and in the absence of a particular adult subspecialty clinician, transitioning the young adult to an adult primary care clinician with consultation to the pediatric subspecialist could occur until adult clinicians are comfortable with the needed subspecialty knowledge or appropriate adult subspecialists are available. In addition, transfer to adult care is best conducted when the youth's health condition is stable, and for patients receiving pediatric palliative care or end-of-life care, timing of transition to adult health care depends on the youth's anticipated disease trajectory and overall goals of care.

### A public health / hospital partnership to improve emergency department transitions of care for vulnerable older adults [^109edec3]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Both government services and health systems have the same goal for older patients: helping them live healthy and happy lives in their communities. Despite this shared goal, structural and funding differences have resulted in a lack of dedicated pathways for collaboration between community services and health systems. In the United States, community health programs for older adults are under the purview of the Administration on Community Living (ACL) that works under the Department of Health and Human Services. The ACL provides services to ensure that older persons (defined as people ≥ 60 years old), persons with injuries, and persons who are differently abled have the support they need to thrive in community living situations. For older persons, this includes assistance with transportation to medical appointments, help with homemaker tasks, home‐delivered meal services, and home safety programs. ACL also supports and oversees Adult Protective Services (APS) and Area Agencies on Aging (AAA), which are run by individual state and county services. These services are designed to assist older adults in most need, especially those who have low income and have functional deficits or social needs.

In 2020, half a million older adults received case management services and over 2.7 million recipients received home‐delivered meals. Unfortunately, despite the availability of ACL services in every US county, millions of older adults in need are not connected to services. For example, > 5 million older adults are food insecure and 17 million are living below 200% of the federal poverty level. Older adults are prevented from accessing needed services by barriers of knowledge (not knowing what resources are available), the complex care process (fragmented systems of support between different agencies), and difficulties with needs expression (difficulty asking for help or knowing what help to ask for). Cognitive impairment, mobility impairment, and emotional concerns are other reasons why older adults do not or cannot reach out for assistance (Table 1). Despite health fairs, websites, and active outreach, it can be difficult for public health service programs to contact vulnerable or isolated older adults.

### What have we learned from long-term studies in juvenile idiopathic arthritis?-prediction, classification, transition [^1d82d6b2]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Transition

Even if the physical health and functioning of adolescents with JIA have improved during the last decades, long-term studies have shown that many, if not most, will reach adulthood with a chronic condition and challenges that need attention from specialized care. The transition process for adolescents with JIA is essential, not merely as a transfer of care to adult rheumatology but as a step towards more autonomy in the health management for adolescents. Transition should be a structured and planned process starting at the beginning of adolescence, with the aim to assess medical, psychosocial, and educational needs to give the adolescents the necessary skills to be gradually more independent in management of all aspects related to their health.

Inadequate transition from paediatric to adult care is associated with loss of follow-up, increased risk of stopping treatment, more flares, and increased disability due to poorly controlled arthritis or uveitis. Young patients are particularly vulnerable as they are prone to risky behaviours that can jeopardize the control of their condition and lead to worsening of their disease. To minimize this risk, several position statements have been developed to guide healthcare providers to give the best care while transitioning patients. The most effective and pragmatic transition programs are built based on key components that help to guide successful transitions. Structured programs generally have a transition coordinator who is responsible for managing the transition process and communication between paediatric and adult teams. Joint clinics, where paediatric and adult rheumatologists co-manage patients across the transition period, have been found to improve continuity of care. Educating the adolescents to improve their knowledge of their disease and treatment options, is also a key factor. Best practices may also include the use of readiness assessment tools to assess self-management skills gaps and to individualize transition plans specific to each patient. Integrated psychosocial support and peer mentoring programs have been demonstrated to positively impact key health outcomes, as well as improve patient satisfaction and facilitate engagement during the transitional phase.

### Improving transitions in care for children with complex and medically fragile needs: a mixed methods study [^c3e28b1d]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Phase 3

Two members of the research team (JC, SB) facilitated a consensus meeting with 18 key stakeholders from across Nova Scotia. Consensus meeting participants included community and tertiary care health care providers, paramedics, senior administrators and policy analysts from the health and education sectors who were not involved in phase 2 data collection. The consensus meeting lasted 2 hours. Key findings from Phase 1 and 2 were presented along with 6 proposed recommendations for inclusion in a provincial policy statement. Recommendations were developed using a behaviour change lens to act as a starting point in addressing the challenges arising from phase 1 and 2 findings. Key priorities in the development of the recommendations included building on existing programs and infrastructures and working with a range of stakeholder groups to co-develop new resources. We also recognized the need to make these resources accessible to end-users across the province, regardless of geographical location. Each recommendation was discussed and revisions were made through a process of consensus as described previously in the methods section. Two points of discussions resulted in modifications to the recommendations. First, consensus meeting participants agreed there was a need for a shared conceptual definition for children with complex and medically fragile needs to orient the present discussion, as well as future clinical and research initiatives examining this population. A number of published definitional frameworks were discussed and participants chose Cohen et al.'s definitional framework as the most suitable given the recent work using this framework in a Canadian context. Second, one of the recommendations included the need for a care coordinator within each provincial health zone to act as a liaison and resource for families and health care providers. Following a lengthy discussion, consensus meeting participants recommended that the coordinator role should be specified as an advanced practice nurse. See Table 5 for a complete list of final recommendations.

### Transition care: future directions in education, health policy, and outcomes research [^a6a221a2]. Academic Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

All youth must transition from pediatric to adult-centered medical care. This process is especially difficult for youth with special health care needs. Many youth do not receive the age-appropriate medical care they need and are at risk during this vulnerable time. Previous research has identified barriers that may prevent effective transition, and protocols have been developed to improve the process. Health outcomes related to successful transition have yet to be fully defined. Health care transition can also be influenced by education of providers, but there are gaps in medical education at the undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate levels. Current changes in federal health policy allow improved health care coverage, provide some new financial incentives, and test new structures for transitional care, including the evolution of accountable care organizations (ACO). Future work must test how these systems changes will affect quality of care. Finally, transition protocols exist in various medical subspecialties; however, national survey results show no improvement in transition readiness, and there are no consistent measures of what constitutes transition success. In order to advance the field of transition, research must be done to integrate transition curricula at the undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate levels; to provide advance financial incentives and pilot the ACO model in centers providing care to youth during transition; to define outcome measures of importance to transition; and to study the effectiveness of current transition tools on improving these outcomes.

### Health care transition for adolescents and young adults with pediatric-onset liver disease and transplantation: a position paper by the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition [^f4ea1f79]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). High credibility.

Recommended approach to transition of care — using the Six Core Elements of Health Care Transition (HCT) defines a sequential clinical process with tools and templates for use by pediatric and adult practices, and implementation of this system may improve the delivery of transition services and result in important long-term gains in patient-centered outcomes when incorporated into both pediatric and adult hepatology and transplant practices. For transition policy, input from the hospital system, the medical team, youth, and parent/caregiver should reflect a consensus on the approach to HCT including target age range for initiation of the process, information to be communicated to the adult team, how the youth will be prepared for the changes of privacy and consent that occur at 18 years of age, and if needed, information and assistance on supported decision-making and guardianship. Tracking and monitoring emphasize that developing a flow sheet to track the youth's progression through HCT is an essential component of program design. For transition readiness, TRA should be completed at enrollment in the transition program and repeated at routine intervals, and TRA can be completed with validated tools used for chronic conditions, such as the Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire, the UNC STARx Questionnaire, or the Got Transition Readiness Assessment for Youth; although these tools are frequently cited in the transplant literature, they are not specific to LT or CLD, there are currently no validated TRA tools for AYA LT recipients, and reliability and validity have not yet been established. In transition planning, a transition plan should be established to set goals and target dates within the transition process; transfer planning also involves developing a medical summary for transfer, an emergency care plan, and preparing the youth and parents for the changes in privacy and consent that occur at age 18, and youth should be oriented to consent for treatment, advanced directives, and release of medical information; medical insurance, community support services, and specialty practices for the youth's needs after transfer should also be established. For transfer of care, a transfer package should be compiled containing a medical summary, the final TRA, an updated plan of care, verification of insurance coverage, an emergency care plan, legal documents (if needed), and a medical condition fact sheet, and following confirmation of the first adult provider appointment, the teams should participate in a final review of care and confirm the pediatric provider's responsibility for care until the youth is seen by the adult provider; a virtual Meet and Greet can be scheduled before the first adult clinic appointment. Transfer completion confirms that care has been established with an adult provider, evaluates the youth's experience with transition, and assesses outcomes.

Health care transition (HCT) payment and practice collaboration — develop innovative payment approaches to encourage collaboration between pediatric and adult care clinicians in the adoption of the HCT process, including the following: financial incentives for collaboration between pediatric and adult practices around HCT; a per-member, per-month additional payment involved in preparing youth and young adults for transfer out of pediatric care and for outreach and follow-up of young adults coming into a new adult care setting; performance-based incentives to encourage pediatric practices to transfer their patients at a certain age with a current medical summary, readiness assessment, and evidence of communication with the new practice and to encourage adult practices to accept a certain volume of new young adults with SHCN with pediatric consultation support; and payment rates for transition as well as future related research and evaluation studies should stratify for patient risk, taking into consideration not only disease complexity but also social determinants of health, adverse childhood experiences, and availability of family and community supports.

### Comment on: a novel transition clinic structure for adolescent and young adult patients with childhood onset rheumatic disease improves transition outcomes [^12c9a1e8]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Hence, a question: Has the time come for all relevant societies, like the efforts of Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society (ASAS)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) in axial spondyloarthritis, to join together to develop recommendations for the care of this vulnerable group of patients?

The ACCORD clinic bridges the gap between pediatric and adult rheumatology, and it might be the right way forward in the care of AYA patients. Furthermore, ACCORD clinic is a step toward a life course management approach in rheumatology enabling trained rheumatologist in this field to manage transitional clinic. Multidisciplinary treatment (MDT) approach to the treatment of AYA patients with CORD involves a pediatric and adult rheumatologist requiring coordination of availability of experts. Another very valid question in MDT approach is: with whom lies the final responsibility and choice of treatment. Ultimately, this should be standardized in the same way as treatment recommendations. Furthermore, structured HCT process for youth with special health care needs has showed improvements in adherence to care, disease-specific measures, quality of life, self-care skills, satisfaction with care, health care utilization, and HCT process of care. We have witnessed recent advances in rheumatology research and approval of wide range of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), biologic (bDMARDs) and targeted synthetic (tsDMARDs). However, not all bDMARDs/tsDMARDs are approved for adolescents limiting their treatment options. The ACCORD clinic has the possibility to take this aspect into consideration as well and improve access to appropriate therapy. Finally, HCT process could be a determining factor to prevent hospital admission rates, surgeries needed and adult clinic attendance rates.

Long-term follow-up care — Recommendation 6: Primary health care professionals should work collaboratively with the oncology subspecialist to prepare survivors and their families for health care transitions. Ensuring a smooth transition from pediatric to adult-oriented health care services is described as posing additional challenges in the care of childhood cancer survivors as they age out of the pediatric system, and these data underscore the importance of communication between oncology and primary care providers in health care transition planning. Pretransition planning is identified as a critical element for all adolescents and young adults with special health care needs, including cancer survivors, and the medical home model provides a strong foundation for this planning.

### Medical home and transition planning for children and youth with special health care needs [^30f26a3c]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Although many physicians may practice medical home medicine, most of the health care system is set up for acute episodic care. For children and youth with special health care needs (CYSHCN), this is costly and inefficient care and unsatisfactory for the patient and family. Transition or the purposeful planned movement of adolescents and young adults with chronic conditions from child-centered to adult-centered care began to evolve in the 1980s as more and more CYSHCN survived into adulthood. There is some progress being made in the implementation of the medical home that may facilitate a more effective transition of young individuals who have developmental disabilities. The greatest barrier to successful transition remains ensuring affordable, continuous health insurance coverage for all young people with special health care needs throughout adolescence and adulthood and engaging adult-oriented health care systems to take over the medical care of these young individuals.

Transition from pediatric to adult care in sickle cell disease (SCD) — "Transition from a pediatric to adult care model requires a structured but flexible process designed to address the intricacies of SCD". Historically, it "has been a time of increased emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and mortality", and "Successful transition requires self-efficacy and advocacy on the patient's part, as well as communication between the pediatric and adult primary care and specialty providers". Planning "is critical, and discussions must begin in the mid-teen years", and it also "requires parental and community support, along with the identification of mental health and cognitive barriers". For logistics, "Special care must be taken to identify a site of both acute and ongoing care for college-bound students at home and at school, as well as a source of reproductive health care (specifically gynecology) from providers knowledgeable about SCD". Transition resources include "the Sickle Cell Transition E-learning Program (from St Jude Children's Research Hospital), Got Transition from the Maternal and Child Health Bureau, and Taking Charge of Your Health and Health Care plan from the CDC", with readiness expectations that "knowledge in medical, social, and employment/academic domains is an expectation", and "The American Society of Hematology has a sickle cell transition readiness assessment tool and resources available online".

### Supporting the health care transition from adolescence to adulthood in the medical home [^5abd861b]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Risk and vulnerability encompass many dimensions of the transition from adolescence to adulthood. Transition from pediatric, parent-supervised health care to more independent, patient-centered adult health care is no exception. The tenets and algorithm of the original 2011 clinical report, "Supporting the Health Care Transition from Adolescence to Adulthood in the Medical Home", are unchanged. This updated clinical report provides more practice-based quality improvement guidance on key elements of transition planning, transfer, and integration into adult care for all youth and young adults. It also includes new and updated sections on definition and guiding principles, the status of health care transition preparation among youth, barriers, outcome evidence, recommended health care transition processes and implementation strategies using quality improvement methods, special populations, education and training in pediatric onset conditions, and payment options. The clinical report also includes new recommendations pertaining to infrastructure, education and training, payment, and research.

### Transition and transfer experiences and their correlates in emerging adults with type 1 diabetes [^c535dfe3]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2025). High credibility.

In line with updated research on transitional care for adolescents and emerging adults with chronic conditions, the three subscales of TEXP-Q mirror the cornerstones in recommendations for successful transition and transfer. Particularly stressed is the importance of respectful, involving, and developmentally adequate communication, which should be both attuned to adolescents and emerging adults, and acknowledge not only medical topics but also psychosocial aspects, health-related behaviors, and self-management skills. Accordingly, mutual partnership between patients and professionals has been repeatedly underscored as central in research on both PCC and transitional care. In detail, ISPAD (International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes) Clinical Practice Consensus Guidelines underscore that transitional care should strive to encompass "transition preparation, education (including counselling on diabetes self-management, diabetes control and complications, differences between pediatric and adult systems, and health-care navigation and readiness assessment", as well as documentation in a written transition plan [, p.864]. Accordingly, adequate information about where to attend for adult care has proved to be a strong predictor for feeling prepared for transfer. With this in mind, it is noteworthy that the participants in our study reported a comparatively low level of participation, as well as of proper transition and transfer preparation, for example, in terms of grasping the legal changes occurring at the age of 18 or taking part in documentation via a written transition plan. In contrast with previous research, the participants in our study reported positive experiences with regard to healthcare provider communication while still in pediatric care. In particular, questions in the corresponding subscale healthcare provider communication cover aspects of being uniquely approached in accordance with one's own developmental and psychosocial state, which is completely in line with up-to-date research, as mentioned above.

In 2017, a group of experts convened to establish recommendations for transitional care of AYAs with juvenile-onset rheumatic diseases. Ultimately, they introduced 12 specific recommendations for transitional care. These recommendations primarily focus on establishing a coordinated and timely network between paediatric and adult care settings. Unfortunately, in many countries, there is no standardized approach to the transition process. A recent survey conducted among European paediatric rheumatologists revealed that less than one-third of respondents had a written transition policy.

The American Academy of Pediatrics has identified six core elements aimed at enhancing the transition process. An effective transition program should comprise the following six steps: (1) transition policy, (2) tracking and monitoring, (3) transition readiness, (4) transition planning, (5) transfer of care, and (6) transition completion. The initial step of the transition process involves the development of a transition policy. This policy should encompass the approach to transition taken by both paediatric and adult rheumatologists, educate all staff members about this approach, and clearly define the roles of the youth, parent/caregiver, and the paediatric and adult health-care teams involved in the transition process. The second step is to establish criteria and processes for identifying transition-aged youth. The third step of transition is to determine whether or not they are ready for transition. The last three steps are to ensure the transition occurs in a planned and structured way. Even though all the steps have been described in detail in theory, examples of transitional care working smoothly are lacking in practice. Consequently, our aim was to thoroughly examine the existing literature and identify the unmet needs in transitional programs specifically designed for patients with JIA.

### Improving transitions in care for children with complex and medically fragile needs: a mixed methods study [^e77a64f0]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Using an integrated mixed methods approach, this project brought together a team of researchers, clinicians, parents/caregivers, and senior-level administrators across the province of Nova Scotia. Data was collected from multiple sources across three phases to achieve a greater breadth and depth of understanding into the existing transition process (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Data collection process

Setting

This study took place at a pediatric tertiary care facility located in Nova Scotia, Canada, responsible for the care of children, youth, and women across the Canadian Maritime Provinces. The Canadian Maritimes is composed of three provinces, with a combined population of almost 500,000 children and youth. This health centre has approximately 230 baby and children beds, with estimated 15,000 acute inpatient admissions, 34,000 emergency department visits, and 210,00 outpatient visits annually. Ethical approval was obtained from the IWK Research Ethics Board (Project #1017345). Data collection occurred between 2015 and 2017.

Phase 1

To address our first objective, a case study design was employed to develop 6 cases representing the experiences of a range of children with complex and medically fragile needs transitioning from hospital to home. We employed maximum variation sampling to ensure a representation of different age groups, levels of complexity, family structures, geography and socioeconomic status levels when possible. Eligibility for this study included parents or guardians of children aged 0–18 years old with one or more chronic conditions that were expected to require specialized care greater than 1 year. This eligibility criteria was created to align with current literature describing children with complex care needs and based on expert opinion from our multidisciplinary research and clinical team. Terminally ill patients were excluded from this study. Clinical leads from each unit in the tertiary care facility invited potential participants according to the eligibility criteria by providing a letter of information describing the study and contact information for the research assistant. The research assistant reviewed the letter of informed consent with potential participants and they were given the opportunity to ask questions before participation.

### Disparities in access to healthcare transition services for adolescents with down syndrome [^bdbf11fd]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare healthcare transition planning in adolescents with Down syndrome with adolescents with other special healthcare needs.

Study Design

Data were drawn from the 2009–2010 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs, a nationally representative sample with 17114 adolescents aged 12–17 years. Parents were asked whether providers and the study child had discussed shifting to an adult provider, changing healthcare needs, maintaining health insurance coverage, and taking responsibility for self-care. The transition core outcome was a composite measure based on the results of these 4 questions. Multivariable logistic regression determined the association between Down syndrome and the transition core outcome as well as each of the 4 individual component measures.

Results

Although 40% of adolescents with other special healthcare needs met the transition core outcome, 11.0% of adolescents with Down syndrome met this outcome. Adolescents with Down syndrome were less likely to be encouraged to take responsibility for their health (32.2% vs 78.4%). After adjustment for demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related factors, adolescents with Down syndrome had 4 times the odds of not meeting the transition core outcome. For the component measures, Down syndrome adolescents had 4 times the odds of not being encouraged to take responsibility for self-care. Medical home access increased the odds of transition preparation.

Conclusions

Adolescents with Down syndrome experience disparities in access to transition services. Provider goals for adolescents with Down syndrome should encourage as much independence as possible in their personal care and social lives.

### Pediatricians transitioning practices, youth with special health care needs in New York state [^42e1d1ff]. Clinical Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess current practices of New York State pediatricians as they transition youth with special health care needs to adult-oriented medical care.

Methods

A survey of New York State pediatricians included 6 critical steps from 2002 consensus statement, 11 essential steps adapted from recent literature, and questions targeting age of starting transition and availability of transition policy.

Results

Of 181 respondents, only 11% have a transition policy. Most assist patients in transition process; identify an adult provider (92%); and create portable medical summary (57%). Only 3% start planning process at recommended age. No respondents are compliant with all 6 critical steps; subspecialists were more likely to report compliance to more than 4 steps.

Conclusions

Participating pediatricians are making gains, yet effort is needed, to incorporate the essential steps into practice for transitioning youth with special health care needs. Recognition of barriers, use of electronic tools, and clarifying subspecialist's approach, may improve compliance with transition recommendations.

### Health care transition for adolescents and young adults with pediatric-onset liver disease and transplantation: a position paper by the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition [^3a023798]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). High credibility.

Health care transition conclusions — increased attention to the HCT process for individuals with CLD and LT is imperative, and until the importance of HCT is appropriately recognized and addressed, these patients will remain highly vulnerable to poor long-term outcomes. A focus on HCT must be routinely adopted across programs to facilitate multicenter collaborations and determine best practice, and this paper outlines a framework for the implementation of a standardized, multidisciplinary approach to HCT which spans both pediatric and adult hepatology and LT services. Successful transition can only be achieved by way of partnership between pediatric and adult providers to ensure continued success following transfer of care.

The lack of focus on young people as a group with particular healthcare needs in medical training and the health service underpins the difficulty that we have experienced as a profession in improving transition in the UK. This article discusses current progress towards improving training in young people's health in the UK, the evidence base for transitional care in young people with chronic conditions with interventions that focus on staffing, service delivery and young people, a practice based approach for transitional care in young people with learning difficulties and complex needs, the need for monitoring and evaluation of transitional care, and the challenge of funding.

### Transitions from pediatric to adult neuromuscular care: a practical guide [^1069ccd9]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

As many as 90% of individuals with childhood onset diseases now live into adulthood. Due to this increase in lifespan, many, such as those with childhood onset neuromuscular disorders (NMDs), need health care transition to adult primary and specialty care providers. Despite growing recognition of the need for transition, only 17% of youth with special healthcare needs are receiving assistance with health care transition. One primary model of transition is the six core elements of transition as defined by the National Alliance to Advance Adolescent Health in their "Got Transition" which serves as a primary framework for other models of care. Growing evidence suggests continued barriers to the transition process, including difficulty finding adult specialists, lack of sufficient communication between pediatric and adult transition care providers, insurance issues, and lack of family/patient engagement in the process. Additionally, there are characteristics of the care team members (patient, family, pediatric and adult healthcare providers) themselves that serve as either positive or negative predictors of the success of transition, such as patient level of disability, family knowledge of the disease process, education level, adherence to treatment, investment in transitioning care, and provider recognition of limits of their own scope of practice. Use of tools to assess patient and family readiness to begin the transition process, optimization of the electronic medical record (EMR) to share information, telehealth, and dedicated transition clinics are key factors in making this process smoother for both patients and healthcare providers.

Health care transition (HCT) core elements — scope and target age with available tools. The page states that "the Six Core Elements of HCT define ways to transition to an adult approach to care by age 18 years and, if needed, to transfer to a new adult clinician", and that this version "includes a transition policy, tracking and monitoring, transition readiness, transition planning and/or integration into adult approach to care, transfer to adult approach to care, and transfer completion with ongoing care including continued self-management skills assessment and self-care education". It further notes that "Figure 3 offers 3 examples of customizable tools available for the first core element (creating a transition policy) for pediatric, family medicine, med-peds, and internal medicine practices", and that "Although most states have set the age of majority at 18 years, it is greater in some states".

### A systematic review of the psychometric properties of transition readiness assessment tools in adolescents with chronic disease [^000ac605]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

There have been recent advances in the development of a transition readiness tool, however most of these require further validation before they can be broadly recommended for clinical practice. Although disease-specific tools predominate, disease-neutral tools have additional advantages for research and clinical application, and focus should be placed on conducting a longitudinal study of a transition tool such as the TRAQ in predicting health outcomes. A reliable and valid transition readiness tool may dissipate some of the uncertainty around the transition process and allow for tailoring of programs to suit the patients' transition needs.

For over 25 years, with medical advances increasing the lifespan of YYASHCN, we have been aware of the need to improve health care transition to adult-based care services. Barriers to health care transition have been identified and in a number of settings, recognition of the problem and preliminary success has been achieved for pilot programs. Evidence-based solutions to improve health care transition for YYASHCN are needed. There are barriers at the patient, family, pediatric, and adult provider, and insurance system levels that must be overcome.

### Addressing transition to adult health care for adolescents with special health care needs [^3412dd44]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the factors associated with addressing the transition from pediatric to adult-oriented health care among US adolescents with special health care needs.

Methods

Data for 4332 adolescents, 14 to 17 years of age, from the 2000–2001 National Survey of Children With Special Health Care Needs were used. The adequacy of transition services was determined by parent self-report. Explanatory variables, including parental education, family poverty status, race/ethnicity, measures of the severity and complexity of conditions, health insurance status, having a personal doctor, and the quality of the parent's relationship with the adolescent's doctor, were entered into a regression model.

Results

Overall, 50.2% of parents reported that they had discussed transition issues with their adolescent's doctor and 16.4% had discussed and developed a plan for addressing those needs. In a multivariate regression analysis, correlates of the adequacy of transition services included older age, female gender, complexity of health care needs, and higher quality of the parent-doctor relationship.

Conclusions

Among adolescents with special health care needs, those who were older and those with more complicated needs were more likely to have addressed the transition from a pediatric to adult-oriented system of care. Furthermore, this analysis demonstrated a strong association between a high-quality parent-provider relationship and the extent to which transition issues were addressed. The importance of transition services for adolescents with less complex needs and the overall impact of health care transition services were not assessed in this study and remain important questions for future investigations.

### Paediatric to adult healthcare transition in resource-limited settings: a narrative review [^3870c0f3]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusion

Adolescence and young adulthood are critical periods in development and need to be viewed holistically in policy and programmes. There is little understood about how best to approach this care in resource-denied settings. This review illustrates prominent themes in order to do so and supports the need for international attention to this population. Prior to establishment of formal HCT programmes, upstream attention must focus on addressing context-specific needs and structural barriers for the successful creation of an adolescent-responsive policy for safe transition from paediatric to adult care.

### A mixed methods study to understand the role of knowledge in transition among youth with sickle cell disease [^99d1a258]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Quantitative phase

We identified individuals with SCD between the ages of 15 and 22 years (as of 31 December 2022) receiving care at a large comprehensive SCD clinic, and determined their characteristics by leveraging data in the statewide Sickle Cell Data Collection Program in Wisconsin. The patient's characteristics included age, sex, race, social vulnerability index, SCD genotype, and the frequency of visits to the pediatric SCD specialty clinic in a year. For individuals with transition assessments, we determined the number of visits 1 year before the completion of the assessment. For individuals with no assessment, pediatric visits were determined as follows: for those aged ≤ 19 years, the number of visits during 2022 was counted; and for those aged > 19 years, visits were counted during the time when they were between 18 and 19 years of age. These data were linked with transition readiness information collected in the SCD clinic for children with SCD. The transition readiness assessments were incorporated into the pediatric SCD clinic in 2020. The SCD clinic programmatically assesses transition readiness among individuals aged ≥ 15 years, using the transition readiness assessment tool developed by ASH. The clinical team chose to use the tool in clinical practice as a point of care tool to identify areas that could be addressed in the context of current and future clinic visits to determine areas of need for individual patients. Furthermore, this tool is specific to SCD, developed and endorsed by ASH, and is formatted on 1 page, making it easier to administer in a paper format. Surveys were administered twice a year when possible. Disease-specific education was delivered by related disciplines (physician, nurse, psychologist, genetic counselor, and social worker). A formal transition program was not in place at the time of data collection, and a transition navigator was not part of the SCD program. Meetings with the local adult SCD team were held quarterly to discuss individuals transitioning to adult care. This study analyzes the transition readiness scores from the first time the adolescents completed the assessment. The tool provides an assessment and summary form designed to facilitate conversations between providers, patients, and their families as the patient transitions from pediatric to adult care, and includes 3 overarching questions. These questions are scaled from 0 to 10 to assess the importance of self-care and confidence about the individual's ability to manage their health care and changing to an adult doctor. Responses ranging between 0 and 3 were categorized as the individual rating self-care importance and confidence as "minimal", between 4 and 7 as "moderate", and between 8 and 10 as "very".

### What constitutes successful commissioning of transition from children's to adults' services for young people with long-term conditions and what are the challenges? An interview study [^c2e5afa5]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2017). Medium credibility.

Service-level coordination, sign-posting and relational support

Coordination, sign-posting and relational support were consistently discussed as central to successful transition. Proposals for commissioning solutions to achieve these focused on enabling young people to self-manage their condition and care with support of a nominated professional. One common proposal was to involve GPs more proactively from early on, alongside paediatricians.

… parents build up great relationships with these paediatricians and so, if they've got, any queries, regardless of whether it's associated to that child's disability or not, obviously they're going to ring the person who knows them best and is, kind of, in charge of their care. So for me that's a really big risk for transition because you've had this brilliant service from this one particular person, for the whole of your child's life, and when they're approaching transition there's no equivalent… (Commissioner/related manager 9, Regional)

… I think we need to involve the GPs from very much earlier on.… maybe if you involved the GP, gives the confidence to the families as well.… (NHS clinician 3, Regional)

Other proposals, for improving transition, included use of specialist nurses and other community clinicians and the creation of 'transition workers'.

… identifying the children and young people at around [age] 14, 15 then the transition workers will introduce themselves and begin to get that process in place… (General practitioner 1, Regional)

### Home health care of children, adolescents and young adults with complex medical needs: clinical report [^7c9c5fcc]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Part II: transitioning from hospital to home health care and vice versa — this section is directed primarily at the inpatient team discharging a CMC and the child's specialists, and notes the discharging team may include nurse or social work care coordinators, therapists, dietitians, and others, with outreach to public health nurses and local emergency services where needed. There are 6 main issues for the discharging inpatient team: establishing a partnership with the family and specialty and acute care providers to identify resources; training the family and other home health care providers; assisting in selecting a home care agency and/or providers of supplies and equipment; arranging educational and developmental services; identifying the medical home and verifying it can provide medical home services including care coordination; and optimizing insurance coverage at home. Ideally, discharge planning will commence in a timely way, preferably as soon as the child is admitted, and the primary care provider (PCP) will be given opportunity to participate throughout the process and be paid adequately for their services by the child's insurance. Transportation on discharge is accomplished most safely with an individualized approach using the principles outlined in the AAP clinical report "Transporting Children With Special Health Care Needs", and if limitations on care such as a "do not resuscitate" order are chosen, the local emergency medical services can be contacted to relay these wishes, and the family needs to have copies of these orders available in the home.

### Advances in managing transition to adulthood for adolescents with congenital heart disease: a practical approach to transition program design: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^788e3efe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Considerations in Designing a Transition Program

Implementation of transition programs can be challenging for health care professionals. With increasing demands of medical documentation, fewer support staff, lack of reimbursement, and a rising volume of patients, finding the time necessary to provide transition‐related education is often difficult. Regardless of approach, there are several key principles that should be at the core of health care transition programs for patients with congenital heart disease (Table 1). Incorporating transition programs and adapting existing technologies can aide in implementation, but a coordinated effort needs to be undertaken between key stakeholders: patients/families, members of the health care teams, health care organizations, and payers. We present key considerations in transition program design, based on emerging and ongoing research.

### Supporting the health care transition from adolescence to adulthood in the medical home [^1a637780]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Pediatric-to-adult health care transition (HCT) barriers and preferences — youth and young adults with special health care needs (SHCN): An updated review of peer‑reviewed articles "published between January 2010 and March 2023" characterizes common barriers across youth, families, and clinicians. The most prominent barrier is "difficulty in leaving their pediatric clinicians with whom they have had a long-standing relationship". Despite "limited preparation", youth with SHCN "appear to have greater transition readiness skills and demonstrate more independence in completing medical tasks than their peers without special needs". Clinician‑reported obstacles include "the lack of communication and coordination and the different practice styles between health professionals", and pediatric clinicians often cite "the lack of adult clinicians to care for youth with pediatric-onset conditions". Recent surveys show adult clinicians "in 3 large integrated care systems and in a national survey of adult endocrinologists indicate an increased willingness to accept new young adult patients". Adult clinicians also request "improved infrastructure… and education and training about specific disease processes and the physical and behavioral stages of youth and young adult development". Table 1 examples include family/youth concerns ("Fear of a new health care system and/or hospital… Not wanting to leave their pediatric clinician and pediatric institution") and system difficulties such as "Lack of communication and coordination and transfer of medical records between adult and pediatric clinician or system… Limited availability of adult primary and specialty clinicians", plus "Difficulty in locating adult clinicians who have specialized knowledge… [and] Loss of insurance coverage among young adults and cost of care barriers".

### Primary care guidance for providers of care for persons with human immunodeficiency virus: 2024 update by the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^9221f6d4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

HIVMA/IDSA primary care guidance — adolescent transition to adult HIV care: ART should be prescribed according to established adult and adolescent treatment guidelines. The transition of adolescents from pediatric to adult care usually occurs between the ages of 18 and 25 years and is impacted by variable factors, from patient preference to availability of providers and system/clinic rules. Youths are at high risk of falling out of care and experiencing poor clinical outcomes during this transition period. The transition of care from pediatric or adolescent providers to adult providers should be a deliberate, comprehensive, and coordinated multidisciplinary youth-friendly process that involves the healthcare team and the patient.

Table 1
Effectiveness strategies in the intervention group

Implementation part

This study adopted Durlak and DuPre's implementation framework, which highlights that the successful implementation of a program is driven by five factors, namely, prevention delivery, prevention support, innovation characteristics, provider characteristics, and community factors.

The prevention delivery system addresses the capacity of a community center to successfully adopt a new program. The current program had received approval for further collaboration from the community center during the first meeting between the research team and the leaders and managers of the community center. Potential benefits to the center, such as increasing the center's capacity to serve the needs of its members, improving the health knowledge of the staff, and enabling the members to live independently in the community, were discussed.

Apart from helping to build the center's organizational capacity, the research team provided program orientation in the second meeting and continued to support the center throughout the study. This served as a factor contributing to the prevention support system (i.e. training and technical assistance). Topics of the meeting included an overview of the study rationale, timeline, roles and responsibilities of each member, recruitment process, and referral criteria. The research team provided continued telephone or one-on-one consultation support for the staff members for any difficulties they encountered during the study.

### Home health care of children, adolescents and young adults with complex medical needs: clinical report [^12ecb0ce]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Home health care transition and discharge for CMC — The medical home should strive to keep an up-to-date care plan and medication list with contact information for team members, and when transitioning between inpatient and outpatient care, medical home and home health care providers should be provided with the discharge summary containing this information. Developmental and educational supports delivered at home are an important aspect of care and should be continually reassessed. Home health care is an important aspect of health care delivery when transitioning from pediatric to adult care, and families should work closely with their child's care team to identify long-term health care needs and start the process of transition early. Inpatient pediatric health care providers and their teams should identify medical needs, involved specialists, and medication and equipment needs and arrange for appropriate home health care service, therapies, and vendors at hospital discharge. Prior to discharge, the inpatient team should assess family psychosocial, financial, and environmental barriers, train families on medications and medical equipment, and provide contact information on who to call for which concerns. Pediatric health care providers should be aware of ongoing changes to coverage of home health services and advocate, when possible, for the appropriate and maximal level of service to support families to care for their CMC at home and in the community.

### Current status of transition preparation among youth with special needs in the United States [^8c2443e2]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine current US performance on transition from pediatric to adult health care and discuss strategies for improvement.

Methods

The 2009–2010 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs is a nationally representative sample with 17114 parent respondents who have youth with special health care needs (YSHCN) ages 12 and 18. They are asked about transition to an adult provider, changing health care needs, increasing responsibility for health care needs, and maintaining insurance coverage. We analyzed the association of selected characteristics with successful transition preparation.

Results

Overall, 40% of YSHCN meet the national transition core outcome. Several factors are associated with transition preparation, including female gender; younger age; white race; non-Hispanic ethnicity; income ≥ 400% of poverty; little or no impact of condition on activities; having a condition other than an emotional, behavioral, or developmental condition; having a medical home; and being privately insured.

Conclusions

Most YSHCN are not receiving needed transition preparation. Although most providers are encouraging YSHCN to assume responsibility for their own health, far fewer are discussing transfer to an adult provider and insurance continuity. Although changes in sample design limit trend analysis, there have been no discernible improvements since this transition outcome was measured in the 2005–2006 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs. The 2011 release of the American Academy of Pediatrics/American Academy of Family Physicians/American College of Physicians clinical recommendations on transition, new transition tools, and the spread of medical home should stimulate future improvements in transition performance.

### Promoting optimal development: identifying infants and young children with developmental disorders through developmental surveillance and screening [^38d3d0c8]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Steps 14 and 15: Developmental diagnosis established and initiate chronic condition management — when a developmental disorder has been diagnosed in a child, that child meets the criteria for a child with special health care needs, and the child should be identified by the medical home for appropriate chronic condition management and regular monitoring and entered into the practice's registry of children and youth with special health care needs; the child may be assigned a care coordinator to work with the family, proactive care planning is needed, and routine follow-up with the medical home between health supervision visits may be warranted; the child health professional should actively participate in all care coordination activities, and decisions regarding appropriate therapies should be determined in consultation with the child's family, therapists, and educators and based on knowledge of the scientific evidence; children with established developmental disorders often benefit from referral to community-based family support services, some children may qualify for additional benefits, and parent organizations can provide information, support, and an opportunity for advocacy.
